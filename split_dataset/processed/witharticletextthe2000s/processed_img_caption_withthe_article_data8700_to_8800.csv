2,BLACK VOICES,Michael Vick Had The Nerve To Say Colin Kaepernick Should Cut His Hair,Taryn Finley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/michael-vick-colin-kaepernick-hair_us_596e113fe4b0b95f893e2051,Vick is heralding the same oppressive ideology that has held him back time and time again.,2017-07-18,Michael Vick said Colin Kaepernick should cut off his afro to further his career in the NFL.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/596e2e911a00003300dbf5c2.png?cache=6mZX3rAnig&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Michael Vick has lost his damn mind.The former NFL quarterback appeared on Fox Sport 1′s “Speak For Yourself” on Monday where hosts asked him what his advice would be to former San Fransico 49er Colin Kaepernick, who is currently not signed with a team. Vick’s response was full of anti-black respectability politics.“The first thing we got to get Colin to do is cut his hair,” Vick told the hosts in the video below. “Listen, I’m not up here to try to be politically correct, but even if he puts cornrows in it, I don’t think he should represent himself in that way in terms of just a hairstyle. Just go clean cut. Why not? You’re already dealing with a lot of controversy surrounding this issue. What he needs to do is just try to be presentable.”Vick continued by saying he understands “all of the social media stuff,” referring to Kaepernick’s efforts activism, but said it’s time for the unsigned quarterback to “step up in a different way.”Co-host Jason Whitlock pointed out the irony in Vick’s viewpoint, noting the “image problem” he had after serving time in jail from 2008-2009 after pleading guilty to running a dogfighting ring. “You were the guy who wore the cornrows, wore the gold chains, played the whole hip-hop image,” he said.“[I] had an afro at times,” Vick responded. “Even during the tough times, it was something that people would whisper in my ear, ‘this is the way you’re being perceived.’ I understand Colin. He’s a great kid. He’s a great kid. And the reason he’s not playing has nothing to do with the national anthem. I think it’s more solely on his play but yea, everything takes precedent in terms of image, perception. You gotta clean it up, you gotta make sure you do it all right.”Vick said it was a difficult process for him to clean up, but it was one he “had to accept” in order to be presentable to the public and the judge.After facing backlash on social media for his anti-black comments, Vick shared a statement on Twitter Tuesday. “Colin Kaepernick’s hair has nothing to do with him not being on a NFL roster right now. Let’s be clear! I wish only the best for Colin,” he wrote. “I stand by what I’ve said about him being signed at some point this season to help a NFL club. I think he is a great kid who has a bright future and I’m looking forward to seeing him on the field again. Trust and believe what I said was not in malice.”Kaepernick, who began rocking his afro after initiating his national anthem protest, tweeted the definition of Stockholm syndrome Tuesday morning ― a move that is being read as a response to Vick. “The Stockholm syndrome appears when an abused victim develops a kind of respect and empathy towards their abuser,” the post read. “This syndrome is also called ‘traumatic bonding’ or ‘victim brainwashing.’”By defending the same racist attitudes that he faced during his 2008 trial for dogfighting (and well after he served 23 months in prison for the crime), Vick reinforces the idea that professionalism and respectability is aligned with whiteness. For years after being locked up, Vick had to jump through hoops on his road to redemption ― like black men in this country often do.As recently as December 2016, while Vick ― fresh haircut and all ― was playing for the Atlanta Falcons, more than 35,000 fans petitioned for him to be excluded from the team’s season finale. While the petition’s page cited his dogfighting conviction as the reason, it’s Vick’s blackness that ultimately made him irredeemable to white America. Vick’s advice to Kaepernick validates the oppressive mainstream view of whose appearance is acceptable (white peoples’) and whose is not (black peoples’). Respectability politics won’t save us, boo.

The model and actress recently sat down with Allure for the magazine’s August issue to talk about women’s issues, politics and her love of art. In true Ratajkowski-fashion, the 26-year-old had some truly poignant and thoughtful ideas to share about feminism and sexuality. Ratajkowski told Allure’s Loren Savini that she lives a life that, at face value, is full of contradictions: She fiercely supports Planned Parenthood and writes eloquent essays on female sexuality, while her Hollywood debut was a topless music video for Robin Thicke’s “Blurred Lines” and she was recently featured in Sports Illustrated’s 50th anniversary swimsuit issue. But, Ratajkowski said, she’s happy being in both worlds. And she hopes young girls learn that they can be whoever they want, outside of the constraints of stereotypes. “I want girls to see that you can be whatever you want,” she said. “Be as specific as you want. You can like this thing and that thing, and you don’t have to feel like the world won’t understand you.”Ratajkowski said she found empowerment in her sexuality and, through that, she found her identity. “To me, any expression that is empowered and is your own as a woman is feminist,” she said. “If a woman decides to dress sexy, it doesn’t mean she’s not a feminist. [We] should be doing things for ourselves. If that is the woman’s choice, and it makes her feel good, then that’s great. Good for her.”We could not agree more.

4,POLITICS,Have Professional Provocateurs Hurt Colleges And Conservatives?,"John A. Tures, ContributorProfessor of Political Science, LaGrange College",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/have-professional-provocateurs-hurt-colleges-and-conservatives_us_596e1fb9e4b05561da5a5ab8,"By all means, bring true conservatives to campus, but not these attention-seeking agitators.",2017-07-18,"<p>Graph by John A. Tures, From Pew Research Center Data.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/596e20002100001b00fc772b.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Polls indicate that while a majority of Americans feel colleges play a vital role, that sentiment isn’t shared by all. The problem is not caused by colleges themselves, or the opinions of low-income Americans, but by “professional provocateurs,” whose actions are actually hurt the conservatives they claim to support.A recent poll by the Pew Research Center finds that while most Americans approve of college, those sentiments aren’t shared by Republicans. A majority of them disapprove of institutions of higher education. It’s a sharp reversal from just two years ago, when a majority of Republicans gave their approval to colleges. That rules out college costs as an issue. And enrollments are up.For those who think this is just some “trailer-park Republican” phenomenon, or other put-down of low income conservatives, think again. First of all, having been a registered Republican who lived in a trailer park, I know that insult pretty well. Second, low income Republicans actually support higher education at higher levels than those of higher incomes on the GOP side.So what changed between 2015 and 2017 to make Republicans mistrust colleges? Numerous articles offered a single issue: controversies over “conservative” campus speakers.There are Milo Yiannopoulos, Ann Coulter and Richard Spencer, who had their speeches cancelled, moved to a different date, or experienced campus violence. And the decisions of colleges to either disinvite or cancel their talks have been cited as the issue which has led to the negative polls among Republicans.So here’s a little truth about these speakers. Colleges weren’t the only group to disinvite Yiannopoulos. In fact, the Conservative Political Action Committee (CPAC) blocked him from speaking at their event, and Breitbart News forced him to resign. It turns out there are limits to free speech for conservatives, especially when he issued his support for pedophilia. As for white supremacist Richard Spencer, who forced Auburn to let him speak, he was booted by CPAC too.Ann Coulter refused to speak on a different night than the one she wanted, and threatened to sue the University of California at Berkeley. Her reactions to being moved from her seat on Delta, tweeting that the passenger who took her seat was an immigrant, and falsely claiming that Delta employees were unionized (they aren’t) show that whether it’s academia or an airline, she’s all too quick to claim she’s the victim. Ironically, a book she wrote is titled Liberal Victim.In fact, that’s the problem. These speakers aren’t really all about the conservative ideology, unless that ideology leads with racism, sexism, homophobia, and insults. They demand very high speaking fees. A student asked me if I would invite one such speaker. When I called about his availability, I was told I had to pay a fee that was twice my budget for the entire year. For them, it’s about selling books, making fees, and making more controversy to make more money.Meanwhile, I’ve had conservatives ranging from politicians to business leaders to those in the military speak. They are all too happy to be invited to a college, and never request a fee (though I spend a little from my budget on a gift and spring for a campus lunch with them and the students). They focus on issues of economics, policy, budgets, national security… you know, stuff conservatives actually stand for. But you’ve never heard of most of them, because they aren’t hucksters.Believe it or not, America has the greatest higher education system in the world. Georgia alone, if it was a country, would be tied or ahead of most European countries with its university system, in terms of rank and quality. Americans and people from around the globe come to our colleges. And what drives the system is, ironically, our freedom.I’m talking about our freedom to study, cover a variety of topics, test hypotheses, and push the boundaries in science, math and engineering, business, education, medicine and professional programs, and even the humanities and social sciences.Yet a small cadre of professional provocateurs, with a career of complaining, quick to play the victim card in all situations, seeks to undermine what Americans have built to become the envy of the world. And all they have done for conservatives is take their money, distort their ideology, crowd out the true believers, and undermine the U.S. university. By all means, bring true conservatives to campus, but not these attention-seeking agitators.John A. Tures is a professor of political science at LaGrange College in LaGrange, Ga.

5,POLITICS,Senator Joins Ethics Probe That Could Get EPA Chief Scott Pruitt Disbarred,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/scott-pruitt-ethics-probe_us_596cf43ce4b0e983c05800ed,The former Oklahoma attorney general is under investigation for misleading Congress about his emails.,2017-07-18,"Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt testifies before a Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., June 27.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/596cf4e61500006303bfdee7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt has been caught repeatedly misleading Congress about his use of different email accounts during his six years as Oklahoma’s attorney general. He said he used just one email, when he actually had two. He sent official correspondence from a personal address, and appeared to deliberately delay public-records requests to cover his tracks before facing a Senate confirmation hearing. Now, a senator involved in that confirmation process is backing an effort that could get Pruitt disbarred in his home state, Oklahoma, for violating ethics rules.Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) plans to submit a lengthy statement and 60 pages of evidence to the Oklahoma Bar Association on Tuesday for its investigation into Pruitt, whom he accuses of lying to him during and after the hearing before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. The bar association began probing Pruitt in March in response to an ethics complaint filed by an environmental group and a University of Oklahoma law professor. Whitehouse, in a letter provided to HuffPost before he submitted it to the bar association, says Pruitt’s “misleading answers, evasiveness, and stonewalling” prevented lawmakers from fully vetting the candidate before advancing his nomination for a Senate confirmation vote. “I have had a front-row seat for Mr. Pruitt’s misleading testimony and his ongoing failure to respond completely and truthfully to Committee requests for him to set the record straight,” Whitehouse wrote in the letter, addressed to bar association general counsel Gina Hendryx. “This conduct is unbecoming of an attorney who is also a public official and who, under law, is required to testify truthfully to Congress.”Pruitt’s deep ties to fossil fuel industries whose pollution he’s now charged with policing became a lightning rod during his confirmation process. Correspondence published by The New York Times in 2014 as part of a Pulitzer Prize-winning series showed Pruitt allowing lawyers from Devon Energy, an oil and gas company, to write a complaint to the EPA under his official letterhead. Since taking office, Pruitt has spent an unusual amount of time courting fossil fuel executives amid aggressive rollbacks of regulations and programs to address climate change.  His failure to provide accurate testimony on his email use fuels concerns that he misled lawmakers to obscure his push to boost oil and gas profits ahead of public health. If he is found guilty of violating rules, the bar association could choose to sanction Pruitt, suspend his license or, in the most severe scenario, disbar him for at least five years.It’s unclear how disbarment would affect his job as EPA administrator. “He misstated the facts over and over again,” Whitehouse told HuffPost in a phone interview on Monday. “This was a case of repeat prevarications, not just an inadvertent slip.” During his first appearance before Congress in January, Pruitt claimed he never used his personal email address for official business. He told Whitehouse that there were “no other email addresses.” After the hearing, he confirmed the statement, telling Whitehouse: “I have used two email addresses since becoming attorney general of Oklahoma. I use a personal email address for personal email, and an official email address for official business. The domain of my personal email address is me.com and the domain for my official email address is oag.ok.gov.”On Feb. 21, four days after he the Senate narrowly confirmed his nomination, the Oklahoma attorney general’s office released 7,564 pages of Pruitt’s emails under court order following a lawsuit from the nonprofit Center for Media and Democracy. The correspondence showed Pruitt using his personal email for official purposes, contradicting his testimony.In June, the second cache of emails handed over to the Wisconsin-based watchdog group revealed that Pruitt used two addresses for the Oklahoma attorney general’s office: scott.pruitt@oag.ok.gov, and esp@oag.ok.gov. The latter, as The Washington Post noted, used the initials for Pruitt’s full name, Edward Scott Pruitt. Whitehouse said Pruitt stalled efforts to make the emails public under Oklahoma’s Open Records Act. In the five months after Mike Hunter, Pruitt’s successor, took over, his office cleared a backlog of open-records requests that dated back to 2014.  The EPA did not respond to a request for comment on Monday. “Somebody needs to hold Scott Pruitt to account or at least investigate some of the questions that remain on his record during his time as Oklahoma attorney general,” Nick Surgey, research director at the Center for Media and Democracy, told HuffPost by phone. “There were many questions that were asked during his confirmation hearing that should have been answered but they weren’t.”John Williams, executive director of the Oklahoma Bar Association, declined to comment on the status of the investigation, but said it could be many months before it concludes.“It can be a fairly elaborate and lengthy process,” Williams told HuffPost. In anticipation of Whitehouse’s submission, he said: “I assume that would cause the investigation to go on longer.”If the bar association concludes that Pruitt violated ethics rules, the case is turned over to a committee that determines whether charges should be filed, and a special tribunal responsible for holding hearings. Ultimately, the state Supreme Court reviews the investigation. The ethics complaint could provide legal ammunition for other challenges to Pruitt’s regulatory agenda. Whitehouse said lawsuits opposing EPA rollbacks of rules on oil and gas companies could go after Pruitt for alleged conflicts of interest.“It’s regrettable that these steps have to be taken about somebody who has been shoved into a Cabinet-level position in the government of the United States of America,” Whitehouse said. “But that’s the world under Trump.” "

Relatives and friends of those killed in the incident attended the ceremony Monday, along with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and members of the country’s royal family, at a park near Amsterdam’s Schipol Airport. The site includes a monument with the names of victims, as well as a “living memorial” in the shape of a ribbon that features one tree planted for each person that died.All 298 passengers and crew members aboard flight MH17 were killed on July 17, 2014, after a surface-to-air missile launched from pro-Russian separatist territory struck the jetliner. The incident spurred international condemnation and a lengthy investigation to determine the events leading up to the killings. A Dutch-led criminal probe is still ongoing, but investigators last September announced they had concluded the plane was downed by a Buk missile that was transported to eastern Ukraine from Russia.The flight was traveling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, but was taken down near the Russian border as conflict raged in eastern Ukraine. Most of the passengers on board the jet were Dutch, and included some of world’s top HIV researchers who were on their way to a conference. "

The aerial shots, published by satellite imagery company DigitalGlobe, show stark differences in the appearance of Iraq’s second-largest city from November 2015 to July 8, days before Iraqi Prime Minster Abadi claimed victory in the battle. ISIS captured Mosul in the summer of 2014 and made it the group’s base in the country. Iraqi forces launched an offensive to drive the militants out of the city in October 2016, at first focusing on eastern neighborhoods. By July 10, Iraqi fighters also had driven ISIS out of the city’s west. But the victory came at a large cost. In some of Mosul’s western neighborhoods, not a single building is left standing. Crucial infrastructure, including sewage pipes, electricity lines, hospitals and schools, have been destroyed. Stanley Brown, director of the U.S. State Department’s Office of Weapons Removal and Abatement, told The Washington Post on Monday it may take decades to clear explosives left behind by the militants. “When I look around the world in some ways there’s nothing like Mosul that we’ve encountered,” Brown said. “The level of contamination though is not one of those where we’re talking weeks and months, we’re talking years and maybe decades.” "

The group is raising money to run its very own border patrol mission in the waters separating Libya and Italy. The Identitarian Movement (known as IB) tries to appeal to its cohorts by putting a youthful spin on one of the far right’s favorite narratives: Migrants are destroying Europe’s social fabric. These “hipsters of the far right” are mostly young professionals under the age of 30 who preach primarily through social media. The group’s most high-profile endeavor so far is Defend Europe, a crowdfunding initiative to that aims to thwart rescue missions by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the central Mediterranean Sea.PayPal took IB’s fundraising page down in June. Yet the group found workarounds and said it had raised more than $117,000 as of Monday.It used the funds to purchase a ship and hire a crew to keep an eye on NGO search-and-rescue missions and “intervene when they’re doing something illegal,” IB founder Martin Sellner said last week in a YouTube video. He claims that IB’s crew will also rescue anyone in distress if its ship receives an SOS signal, but the group then will do everything in its power to send the people back to Africa.“Our goal is to step in where our politicians are failing and to do what is necessary to stop the deadly illegal migration into Europe,” according to the IB website. “An invasion is taking place. This massive immigration is changing the face of our continent. We are losing our safety and our way of life and there is a danger we Europeans will become a minority in our own European homelands.”IB blames humanitarian organizations like Doctors Without Borders and Save the Children ― which, alongside the Italian coast guard and the European Union’s border patrol, man vessels that rescue migrants and bring them to safety in Italy ― for exacerbating the migrant crisis across Europe by enabling human traffickers. Traffickers are more likely to send people out to sea, the argument goes, if there’s a panoply of rescue options in place. The NGOs “are nothing less [than] a part of the international human [trafficking] ring and the migrant business,” according to IB’s website. In his YouTube video, Sellner also made clear his group’s objection to the flow of migrants into Europe. “If you invite the whole of Africa, you don’t have Africa,” he said. “You become Africa.”Almost 90,000 refugees and migrants – 15 percent of whom are children ― have crossed the central Mediterranean Sea to Italy so far in 2017. More than 2,200 have died en route.The influx has placed many European countries ― especially Italy ― under serious strain. Yet the efforts of the NGOs have mitigated the scale of the humanitarian crisis. Thousands of people have been rescued over a period of a few days.Sending people back to countries like Libya isn’t a long-term solution, said Sarah Crowe, UNICEF refugee and migrant spokeswoman. Smuggler networks have flourished in the lawless state, luring people there with promises of work. What these migrants often find instead is rampant abuse, imprisonment and sexual exploitation, propelling them to flee towards Europe.“One of the reasons why migrants ― children particularly ― take these journeys is because what’s happening at home ... pushes them to do so,” Crowe said. “If you have a lion at your back and the sea in front of you, you’re going to take the sea.”NGOs claim they are filling the vacuum that European governments created and are merely fulfilling their life-saving obligations. Yet critics contend that the emergence of more search-and-rescue boats has spurred more people to attempt the perilous journey.“The NGOs are almost like a ferry service. It’s almost as if the smugglers were putting people directly on NGO boats,” an anonymous European official told Reuters in May.Italy’s government last week proposed a code of conduct for NGOs operating in the Mediterranean. But officials with these organizations expressed concerns the rules will limit their ability to effectively carry out their missions by preventing vessels from entering Libyan waters.The debate is fodder for far right groups across Europe, which have experienced a resurgence in response to issues such as the migrant crisis and terrorism.Martin Sellner, IB’s founder, insists that he sees no parallels between his ideology and Europe’s more traditional far right movements.“We see ourselves as patriots, not neo-Nazis,” he told CNN last year. “We don’t hate immigrants. But we also don’t want to see the country change and end up minorities in our countries. We wanted to express this opinion without anti-Semitism, without the racism of the old right.”The group did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.IB’s foray into the central Mediterranean will likely prove to be more symbolic than anything else. A properly run search-and-rescue mission costs millions of dollars per month. Those who have already been operating in the area for years, Crowe said, are still vastly underfunded."

10,POLITICS,"Americans Are Hopeful About The Economy, But Not About The President",Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/economy-trump-polling_us_596d298ce4b0b95f893d75b9,Donald Trump gets low marks from the public for his temperament.,2017-07-17,"President Donald Trump wears a cowboy hat as he attends a ""Made in America"" products showcase event at the White House on July 17, 2017. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/596d2b3e2100003700fc7545.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There’s little good news for President Donald Trump in a blizzard of new polling data published over the last few days.Nearly half of respondents think the U.S. has become a weaker world leader since Trump took office, according to a Washington Post/ABC News survey published on Sunday, with most saying they don’t trust the president to negotiate with other leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin. Just under one-third of people polled by Monmouth University say Trump has spent a lot of time focusing on issues important to average Americans. According to data released on Monday, most respondents say they’re concerned about the Trump administration’s attitude toward Russia and say they support further investigation into Russian election interference.And most Americans surveyed disapprove of Trump’s work as president, not to mention his specific handling of health care, immigration and international relations, according to a Bloomberg news survey conducted by Selzer & Co. and also released Monday. A majority, 56 percent, say they’ve become more pessimistic about Trump since he was elected, with few believing he’ll be able to live up to his promises to build a border wall, reform the tax code or revive the coal industry.The bleakness of the latest round of numbers on Trump is all the more remarkable since Americans’ economic views, traditionally among the strongest drivers of presidential approval, are relatively optimistic. (The economy, which also traditionally ranks at the top of Americans’ concerns, is now playing second fiddle to concerns about health care.)Fifty-eight percent of Americans polled say they’re moving closer to their hopes for their career and finances, “tied for the highest recorded in the poll since the question was first asked in February 2013,” according to Bloomberg. Most expect the stock market to close out the year higher than it started. Other polling has found Americans displaying more confidence in the economy than they have for years, with consumer spending nearly at a nine-year high. “If you take the president’s scores out of this poll, you see a nation increasingly happy about the economy,” pollster J. Ann Selzer told Bloomberg. “When Trump’s name is mentioned, the clouds gather.”Trump’s overall approval rating currently stands at an average of 40 percent, per HuffPost Pollster’s aggregate of public polling, with 55 percent disapproving, for a net rating of about -15.About the best news for the president is that his numbers have remained relatively stable since June. While the demise of the first round of the GOP’s unpopular health care bill appeared to take a toll on his numbers, the latest debate has shown little sign of doing so. The ongoing controversy over the Trump administration’s relationship with Russia has also done seemingly little to move the needle.“Donald Trump’s job rating has basically held steady amid another round of supposedly damaging news,” Monmouth University’s Patrick Murray noted. “Most Americans disapprove of his son and other advisers meeting with a Russian lawyer during the 2016 campaign, but that hasn’t really moved the needle on any other public opinion metric related to the president.”Trump’s ratings have, however, dropped since earlier in his presidency. His net approval stood at about -8 at the beginning of May, and -3 at the beginning of February. The downward shift isn’t unusual, as FiveThirtyEight noted Monday ― presidents tend to see their numbers fall off as they delve further into their first terms ― but the ratings themselves are historically bad for a modern-day president.Trump took office with substantially lower approval than his predecessors, and the intervening months have done nothing to improve that difference. Although his ratings remain high among Republicans, the president saw very low numbers from Democrats and independents during his first quarter in office. Some of that disparity appears to be part of a trend toward more partisan approval ratings: Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton all also saw far lower ratings from the opposition party than did their predecessors. But Trump has taken the partisan gap to a new level, while also failing to attract much support from those identifying with neither party.Unlike Obama and George W. Bush, Trump gets worse scores for his character than for his policy positions, according to a recent Gallup study. A recent HuffPost/YouGov survey similarly found Trump scoring 10 points lower for his temperament than for his policy positions.“Trump’s perceived character shortcomings appear to be the primary basis for why Americans disapprove of the job he is doing,” Gallup’s Jeffrey M. Jones noted. “As such, much of the opposition to Trump is more fundamentally rooted in who he is, rather than how he is doing his job, which suggests negative opinions of him will not change easily.” While the president has staunchly defended his use of Twitter as a way to “get the honest and unfiltered message out,” the Post/ABC poll finds that two-thirds of Americans disapprove of Trump’s Twitter habits, with 53 percent disapproving strongly. A majority call his tweets inappropriate, insulting and dangerous, with just 36 percent viewing them as effective, and just 21 percent saying that they’re refreshing. Even 38 percent of Republicans say that Trump’s conduct has been unpresidential.Dislike of Trump’s demeanor may not always be enough to sour his supporters on him. Trump was also historically unpopular when he was elected president ― and, as HuffPost noted earlier this month, 19 percent of voters who didn’t believe he had the temperament to serve as president voted for him anyway. But Trump’s approval rating could have an impact on his party’s chances in the 2018 midterms: In recent midterm elections, the sitting president has generally outpolled his party as a whole.Bloomberg Politics and Selzer & Co. surveyed 1,001 adults between July 8 and 12. Monmouth University surveyed 800 adults between July 13 and 16. The Post/ABC poll surveyed 1,001 adults between July 10 and 13. All three used live interviewers to reach both landlines and cell phones."

It is often easy to overlook the hard work that Miami International Airport workers perform, but their labor makes one of the busiest airports in the country run smoothly. After all, there were over 35,110 flights either landing or taking off Miami International Airport in the month of May alone.Unfortunately, these workers are not receiving their fair share for their hard work. A private contractor operating at Miami International Airport named Ultra aviation Services is stiffing its employees off their wages and their healthcare, offering them a health care plan that does not even cover minimal requirements under county ordinance. The Miami Dade County Living Wage Ordinance states that Ultra can pay employees $12.63 an hour with a qualifying health benefit plan or $15.52 an hour without a healthcare plan. MIA workers say Ultra’s plan through TransAmerica Life Insurance does not meet the minimum requirements of a health plan.They are right. The policy Ultra offers its workers is laughable in its limitations. For example, the plan only covers $100 a day for hospital stays. In Florida, the average per day cost in a for-profit hospital is $1,600, while the cost in a non-profit hospital is $2,200 a day.The mediocre plan is robbing needed medical care from the baggage handlers, ramp workers, security guards and others who keep the airport running. Jose Ferrer, 46, is a security guard with joint pains so severe his usual medication no longer alleviates the pain. Ferrer told the Miami New Times that his doctor gave him two options, get a blood test or an MRI scan on his hands and knees. Unfortunately, his insurance plan covers only one blood test per year and an MRI would cost more than $500 out of pocket, leaving him unable to get the treatment he badly needs.Attorney Miguel De Grandy, who represents Ultra, claims the healthcare plan is a “preventive health plan” that complies with the federal Affordable Care Act and the County Living Wage Ordinance. In the lead up to the busy Fourth of July weekend at Miami International Airport, more than 100 Ultra Aviation employees went on a 24- hour strike led by SEIU 32BJ, an airport workers union, to protest Ultra’s unfair practices against them and appeal to Miami Dade County officials to intervene. Community supporters and elected officials, including State Representative Daisy Baez and State Senator Jose Javier Rodriguez, joined the strike to support the mostly Hispanic airport workers and join them on a parade led by a Haitian marching band.Their action is a powerful way for travelers to see the people who work behind the scenes to keep the airport running. It is a powerful reminder for all of us the next time we catch a flight to remember the fight of baggage handlers, ramp workers or security guards to earn a fair wage for their hard work."

The Balch Springs Police Department later changed that account, however, after video of the incident showed the teenagers were actually driving away from Oliver when he fired multiple rounds into the packed car.Compounding matters, Merritt said, the officers on the scene failed to respond properly after the shooting, roughing up the teenagers instead of providing medical attention.“They were immediately treated as common criminals by other officers; manhandled, intimidated and arrested while their brother lay dying in the front seat,” he said.Oliver is out on $700,000 bail, reports Dallas News.

An ABC News/Washington Post poll found that 66 percent of Americans are mistrustful of Trump negotiating with Putin.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/596d2ff31500002000bfe01e.jpeg?ops=crop_0_63_5651_3169%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON – Having told falsehood after falsehood about everything from inaugural crowds to FBI Director James Comey’s firing, why would anyone believe a single word coming from this White House?That’s the fundamental problem a beleaguered communications team faces as it tries to respond to claims that Donald Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia to help win the presidency last year, with the public appearing to settle into the view that White House statements simply cannot always be taken as fact.“Credibility may be repairable around the margins ― if, for example, someone misspeaks,” said Ned Price, a former CIA analyst and spokesman for former President Barack Obama’s National Security Council. “But there’s a point of no return after which credibility will always be tarnished. The White House passed that point long ago.”An email released last week showing that Donald Trump Jr. not only knew the Russian government was helping his father but also that Trump’s eldest son actively encouraged it came after a full year of candidate Trump and his campaign team initially denying any contact with Russians, let alone collusion.“If it’s what you say I love it,” Trump’s eldest son wrote just minutes after receiving the June 2016 email from a business associate offering “very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.”President Trump, as he has for days, again tried to defend himself and his son on the issue with a Monday morning statement on Twitter: “Most politicians would have gone to a meeting like the one Don jr attended in order to get info on an opponent. That’s politics!”That was followed hours later by press secretary Sean Spicer claiming in the daily White House press briefing: “There was nothing, as far as we know, that would lead anyone to believe that there was anything except for a discussion about adoption and the Magnitsky Act.”The narrative of the “adoption” agenda was crafted by top White House staff as they flew back from Germany on July 8 ― even though they knew that the email was offering negative information about presidential rival Hillary Clinton and didn’t mention adoption or the Magnitsky Act, which had imposed sanctions on Russians.The White House press office did not respond to queries about the Trump White House’s pattern of false statements, and Spicer did not respond to a request for clarification about Monday’s adoption claim from the White House lectern.What Spicer or anyone in the press office could do at this point to regain credibility is unclear. Spicer’s aggressive insistence on provably untrue assertions began the day after the Jan. 20 inauguration, when he told reporters in the White House briefing room that the crowd attending Trump’s inaugural was the largest ever ― even though photographs clearly showed it was a fraction of the size of Obama’s inauguration in 2009.In just his first month in office, Trump went on to make false claims about the “standing ovation” he received Jan. 21 at CIA headquarters, the “millions” of “illegal” votes cast in the November election, the murder rate, the news coverage given to terrorist attacks and a nonexistent terrorist incident in Sweden.Trump had the lowest percentage of truthful statements of any recent presidential candidate, according to the fact-checking group PolitiFact. Of the more than 400 Trump claims the group has analyzed since he entered the race in 2015 through his first six months in office, a full 69 percent are rated “mostly false,” “false” or “pants on fire.”A new poll shows that the repeated dishonesties appear to have taken their toll on the Russia issue.In an ABC News/Washington Post survey released Sunday, 63 percent of respondents said the meeting Trump Jr. had with a Russian lawyer and a former Russian spy, among others, at Trump Tower in June 2016 was inappropriate, compared with 26 percent who did not see a problem. That meeting also included Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and now a top White House adviser, and Paul Manafort, who was then chairman of the Trump campaign.A full 66 percent of Americans are mistrustful of Trump negotiating with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, while only 32 percent trust he would do a good job.More broadly, only 36 percent of Americans approve of the job Trump is doing as president, a 6-percentage-point drop from what that poll found three months ago. “Lies/false statements/dishonest” was tied for second among the characteristics that Americans most disliked in Trump, according to the poll results. “Inappropriate way he talks and acts” and “everything” were tied for first.Mike McCurry, a press secretary in the Bill Clinton White House, said Clinton was able to bounce back after being caught lying about his sexual involvement with an intern by, in part, focusing on his work. “When faced with a tough crisis about things personal, President Clinton over and over said that he would get back to his job as president,” said McCurry, now a theology professor at Wesley Theological Seminary in Washington, D.C. “And he did. And the results were pretty good, and the American people were very forgiving. That’s the best lesson this White House should take away.”Whether Trump or his White House staff is capable of that, McCurry said, is an open question. “An ironclad commitment to telling the truth would be helpful, but I am not sure how you would get this team to commit to that responsibility.”"
18,POLITICS,Fixating On Trump's Impeachment Is Counterproductive,"Betty Chang, ContributorGender & Innovation Researcher",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trumping-trump-why-fixating-on-impeachment-is-counterproductive_us_596c0d9be4b09e26b6d76924,"Even if Trump is impeached, the battle is won but not the war.",2017-07-17,<p><em>Time spent in office by US Presidents as of July 14. </em></p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/596c144021000025a7fc7283.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last Wednesday, California Democrat Rep. Rob Sherman filed the first article of impeachment against President Donald Trump on grounds of obstruction of justice by firing ex-FBI Director James Comey while investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 US election was ongoing.Constant murmurs of impeachment have circulated ever since Trump was elected into office last November, and they grow louder after every stupidly bizarre action he, his administration, and his family takes―the most recent being his son seeking out damning info from Russian officials on election opponent Hillary Clinton, and subsequently publishing the e-mail thread on Twitter. But what are the actual chances of impeachment? According to the history, very slim.History indicates that impeachment is a long, complicated process where intent is difficult to prove.As of July 14, Trump has been in office for 173 days. That’s already longer than William Harrison, the ninth president of the U.S. who died of pneumonia 31 days into his term, and more than one-tenth into Trump’s full four-year term. Out of the 44 presidents of the United States since Washington in 1797, 33 who were elected into office served at least one full term; four were assassinated while in office; three died of other causes; one resigned; and none have ever been impeached.Yes, Trump is on track to becoming the worst president in the history of the US. But history also reflects that presidents who implemented terrible policies, said terrible things, and were wholly terrible people still served full terms.In recent years, George W. Bush made the case for invading Iraq on the unsubstantiated grounds that the Iraqi government possessed weapons of mass destruction, in the process racking up an additional $1 trillion in U.S. debt.Bill Clinton was impeached on grounds of perjury to a grand jury and obstruction of justice stemming from the Paula Jones’ sexual harassment lawsuit before ultimately being acquitted by the Senate.Additionally, the burden of proof for impeachment is extremely high and a lengthy process (although probably not as lengthy as the 2016 election campaign which lasted 597 days). The closest a President has been to being removed from office was Richard Nixon, who resigned in 1974 before certain impeachment when audiotapes provided clear evidence of obstruction of justice, abuse of power and contempt of Congress against him during the Watergate scandal.In the case of Rep. Sherman’s article of impeachment, there is little backing from both sides. Democrats worry that the article will only further energize Trump’s supporters, and the article has a next-to-none chance of passing in the Republican-led House.We need to stop fixating on impeachment.Whether likely or not, headlines since November like “What a Trump impeachment could mean for 2020” and “Trump impeached? You can bet on it” reflect the rampant fixation on Trump’s removal as the solution. “They’ll get rid of Trump soon enough,” I overheard a New York commuter on the B train exclaim wistfully to her colleague. It is this reliance on impeachment which is dangerous and counterproductive to progress in this country.Firstly, Americans have become so reliant on the idea of impeachment that they’ve removed themselves out of the equation for positive change. But change is the responsibility of every individual mobilizing locally as well: calling Senators and voicing concerns; volunteering at local sexual and reproductive health clinics; reducing carbon footprints by recycling, carpooling, and eating less red meats; exposing fake news; and sharing the stories of immigrants, refugees, women, blacks and everyone else who makes up America’s melting pot.Secondly, even if Trump is impeached, the battle is won but not the war. Americans elected Trump into the White House which points to a scarier problem. At the grassroots level, Americans should engage with their governments, go to the polls in 2018 and vote, and start the important conversations to challenge and change ever-divisive mindsets. Additionally, Trump on many fronts only exasperated American issues that existed long before he entered the White House, like fighting climate change, addressing longstanding racial and religious discrimination, keeping borders open against protectionist values, and championing LGBTQ and women’s rights.Lastly, if Trump is impeached, we’ll have Pence in office, the current vice president who once said “smoking doesn’t kill” and “science is very mixed on the subject of global warming”.So let’s stop talking about impeachment and get to work to trump Trump. To start, here is a list of things you can do and organizations that need your support."

The game he is referring to was Saturday’s 16-inning, nearly six-hour uber-marathon, which along the way featured a scintillating five minute umpire review.Baseball is a pastoral sport in a digital age. There’s actually great appeal in that. But even Springsteen stops the show after three hours. Nobody wants to watch anything for six hours. Not even porn.As a Yankee fan, I adore catcher Gary Sanchez, but in the course of a game he visits the mound more than the dugout. Meanwhile, the batter scratches his thigh and plans his stepping-out-of-the-box strategy. Want to improve “pace of game”? Simply ban pitcher-catcher conferences except at the top of an inning or a pitching change. There’s not a fan in the country who would complain. If pitchers and catchers insist that is not workable, then provide them with ear pieces so they could talk to each other during the game. Broadcast their conversation live. Hey, it’s the 21st century. Privacy is dead, even in baseball.Oh, and about those full infield conferences. We all know there’s no crying in baseball. Well, there are no huddles either.But nooooo, Commissioner Rob Manfred’s genius move to shorten the game was to eliminate pitches thrown for intentional walks. Never mind that many games don’t have intentional walks. Look on the positive side: Going forward, any game with ten intentional walks will now be two minutes shorter. Sweet relief!As any baseball fan knows, it’s not just the length of the games destroying the sport, it’s the start and end times. The seventh game of last year’s World Series started on a Wednesday night, a few minutes after 8, and ended at 12:30. Even without the extra inning of play and 17-minute rain delay, the game would have ended around midnight. (In case you’re wondering, the average length of a 2017 postseason game was nearly three and a half hours.) Conversely, this year’s Super Bowl was played on a Sunday, started at 6:37 and, even with the extended halftime and overtime, was over by 10:30. Night baseball games should start no later than 7.And enough with these mind-numbing extra inning borefests. During the regular season, baseball is 9-innings period. After that, decide the game with a home-run derby. Already, I hear the traditionalists howling. Let them howl. Fans love the home-run derby. In fact, the recent all-star home-run derby was more highly rated on television than the all-star game itself. Give the people what they want, which is shorter games with more drama.While I’m on the subject:No more playing Kate Smith’s revolting rendition of “God Bless America” during the 7th inning stretch at Yankee Stadium, not unless they are going to follow it with Woody Guthrie’s “This Land Is Your Land.” But no, that would add more time to the game. Ban Kate Smith. She was probably on steroids anyway.And speaking of cutting time between innings, relief pitchers should be prohibited from throwing warm-up pitches on the field. That’s what the bullpen is for. Also, there is no reason for a manager to stroll out to the mound to make a pitching change. Make the change from the dugout, get the new guy in there.And commercials: cut one thirty-second spot between innings and, viola, you have just cut at least eight minutes per game.Baseball is the only team sport without a clock, something I used to love. But now I want a pitch clock. Throw the freakin’ ball! To the batter. Not the first baseman! How many pick-off attempts does a man have to watch before you can call him a fan? As for umpire reviews: The guys in the booth have 90 seconds. If they can’t figure it out by then, the ruling on the field was close enough.I can’t take much more of this. If none of the above works, then drastic times call for drastic measures. Two strikes and you’re out? Three fouls after two strikes and you’re out? Seven inning games? None of this could be ruled out because the six-hour, extra-inning death march can no longer be tolerated. As Captain Picard once said, “The line must be drawn here.”My next move would be to designate fans as fielders. Then, any ball, fair or foul, caught by a fan would be an out. This would not only have the advantage of shortening games, but would encourage exciting competition between fans. For example, Yankee fans at Fenway Park would want to make sure that a homer hit by Aaron Judge was not caught by a Red Sox fan and ruled an out. What a great idea!Joe Raiola is Senior Editor of MAD Magazine and Producer of the Annual John Lennon Tribute in NYC. He has performed his solo show, “The Joy of Censorship” in over 40 states."

In a recent interview with People magazine, the WWE star and actor revealed his time-consuming manscaping routine that takes anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour daily, using around six bottles of shaving cream every month.“I’m completely man-scaped from head to toe — from the ears down — so that takes a bit of time,” he told the outlet. “I’m constantly trying to stay up on fine lines in my skin and that stuff, so I’m a lot more grooming-centric than you would realize. My routine is a lot more than you would think — I’d say it’s a strong 7 1/2 out of 10.” He added that it takes “a lot of shaving cream and a very good razor — and time,” to get the job done. “I have a lot of surface area to cover.” Cena said he first started manscaping when he was just a teenager competing in bodybuilding events. From then on, he decided to keep it up. “It’s something that I started, and the first time you manscape yourself and it starts to grow back, it is so uncomfortable, so I just kept doing it,” he explained. Cena, who is engaged to wrestler and “Total Divas” star Nikki Bella, told People he sometimes steals his fiancée’s moisturizer and deodorant.Though he didn’t get too detailed about his skincare routine, we’ll pretend it’s somewhat close to what Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson recently tweeted out: Heading to the drugstore, ASAP.

Two, of course.Fans of the fearless heroine should be happy to hear that Lynda Carter, who portrayed Wonder Woman in the ’70s TV series, is open to a role in the (not-yet-confirmed but totally happening) sequel to the 2017 film. The 65-year-old star told People magazine she had already spoken to director Patty Jenkins about a possible appearance.“It really is up to Patty, and if it works in an organic way it’ll be great fun and it’ll be wonderful to do,” Carter said in an article published Thursday. “Am I open to it? Absolutely. I ADORE Patty Jenkins, and it’ll be wonderful to do. But we’ll just see how that goes.”Carter, who currently stars as President Olivia Marsdin on the CW’s “Supergirl,” also said she wasn’t able to appear in this year’s “Wonder Woman” film because of a timing issue.Even the newest Wonder Woman can’t get enough of Carter. In May, Gal Gadot literally bowed down to Carter during the film’s Hollywood premiere.“I just love her very much,” Gadot told Entertainment Tonight in reference to Carter. “I think that she’s such a special woman.”Jenkins’ “Wonder Woman” became the highest grossing live-action film directed by a woman just weeks after its June 2 release.

The Mexican-American singer ended the group’s acceptance speech by raising the golden gramophone and declaring their solidarity with Latinos across the country. “We felt it was the perfect moment to speak up and say ‘We are also the face of this country and what we want to do is work and find our place in the world just like everyone else’,” Joy told HuffPost during a recent phone interview.It was an emotional moment for the brother-sister duo, known simply as “Jesse & Joy,” who won the Grammy for Best Latin Pop Album that night. The number of people who heard the artists’ speech was limited to those who had tuned into the Grammy’s pre-telecast online, but they said the simple act of being the only Mexican-Americans on the red carpet felt like the perfect way to chip away at harmful stereotypes of their community. As Jesse, 34, and Joy, 31, celebrate over a decade in the industry ― during which they’ve become a familiar fixture on the Latin music charts with hits like “Espacio Sideral,” ”¡Corre!” and “Ecos de Amor” ― the siblings feel more compelled than ever to use their platform for good.That’s where the band’s new music video for their single “Un Besito Más” comes in. The group debuted the video on July 11, during this year’s National Council of La Raza (which recently rebranded as UnidosUS) conference. The video, directed by Colombian filmmaker Simón Brand, follows the story of a young and talented U.S.-born girl who suddenly loses her undocumented parents to deportation after the family survives a tragedy. It also includes statistics, in both English and Spanish, to contextualize the issue.For Jesse and Joy, the drive to raise awareness in support of the millions of U.S.-born children who fear losing their parents to deportation was inspired by their experience being raised by a Mexican father and an American mother in Mexico City. “En carne propia (firsthand), we know what amazing things can be achieved coming from an integrated family,” Jesse told HuffPost. ”[‘Un Besito Más’] is a song we wrote for our dad who passed away four years ago, there’s a lot of special feelings and emotions that we wanted to translate into something that was bigger than us and our daddy. And we just thought it was a great moment to use the power of music and share a bigger message than us.”Joy says immigration is an issue that “hit most close to home,” and it felt like it was their responsibility to show the tragic consequences of deportation.“We realized how many of us don’t really understand what is behind this issue,” she said. “A lot of us hear the word ‘deported’ or ‘deportation’ and we don’t know what that means. It’s basically just another word that we can only imagine what it’s like but none of us really truly know what is behind it. We really don’t know the faces behind this word. We don’t know what is happening to these families.”Growing up in a Mexican and American home was “amazing,” the artists said. The siblings grew up speaking both Spanish and English and were exposed to music in both languages, but straddling those two identities didn’t come without its share of difficulties. Joy recalled the way some people mocked the brother and sister because despite being bilingual, their Spanish and English wasn’t “completely perfect.” “I remember going to our dad to say ‘I don’t like that they’re making fun of me or why are they making fun of us for the way we speak?’,” she said. “I’m never going to forget what he told me. He goes: ‘Well look, they can mock you all they want but remember that you’re speaking in two different languages and you’re doing twice the effort.’ I think that stuck. And while we were growing up we really learned to see with two visions of absolutely everything, that includes music.”“Jesse & Joy” began sharing that dual identity with fans recently, with the release of their eponymous bilingual album in February. Fresh Spanish-language music is on the way as well, including the single “3 AM” ft. Cuban duo Gente de Zona (which Joy described as “Jesse & Joy on mojitos” and Jesse flipped to “Gente de Zona on tequila”).“We were singing almost only in Spanish for almost 10 years and it was, for us, super delicate to kind of cross that line, but it got to a point where we couldn’t be afraid of it anymore,” Joy said. “We knew we had a big fan base we couldn’t let down, but we’ve opened the doors to our house. They’ve gotten to know a big part of the house but there’s one room that hasn’t been open. We want to open that door, as well, and let them get to know that side of us whenever the music feels right.”“So yes there will be more music in English as much as there will be more music in Spanish ― and there will be some Spanglish in between,” she chuckled."
23,POLITICS,Russia Spent A Fortune Shilling For Trump – And May Not Have Broken Any Laws,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/russia-trump-internet-laws_us_59693615e4b0174186278e40,U.S. election laws never contemplated a foreign power inventing fake news and spreading it on the internet to influence an election.,2017-07-17,Russian President Vladimir Putin and President Donald Trump talk during a meeting on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg on July 7.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/596936f91500006303bfda3e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON – When Russian leader Vladimir Putin meddled in key Rust Belt states to help Donald Trump become president, he also may have exposed an election law loophole big enough to drive busloads of Macedonian internet trolls through.Fabricated claims about Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s poor health, impending indictment, even involvement in a pizza-parlor based pedophilia ring that were then amplified and recirculated by Kremlin-paid hackers may have helped Trump win critical states like Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.But it’s not clear that paying for the creation or dissemination of such “fake news” violates election law, campaign finance experts said.“Getting at what Russia did, but establishing that they broke the law in some way, is not as easy as looks like from some distance,” said Paul Ryan, head of policy and litigation at Common Cause. “We’re kind of in a new world here. This is the first time in the United States where fake news was deployed and used effectively.”Investigators from congressional intelligence committees and the office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller are looking into Russian interference in the election and possible links to the Trump campaign. Had Trump’s data operation shared information with the Russians or asked them for help targeting voters, that coordination would be enough to expose both the campaign and the Russians to election law charges.The Trump campaign, and subsequently the Trump White House, have for a year denied collusion with the Russians ― a claim that fell apart this week when Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., released an email showing he was eager for negative information about Clinton, even if it was part of the Russian government’s efforts to help his father.“This is ridiculous. It’s nuts,” said Richard Painter, who was the George W. Bush White House chief ethics lawyer. He pointed to Trump’s public call last year for Russia to find Clinton’s emails deleted from her private server. “He basically encouraged criminal activity, told a foreign government to engage in computer hacking. People voted for him anyway.”The U.S. intelligence community’s Jan. 6 report about Putin’s work to help Trump says the propaganda campaign began with state-paid news organizations like RT and Sputnik.“RT’s coverage of Secretary Clinton throughout the U.S. presidential campaign was consistently negative and focused on her leaked e-mails and accused her of corruption, poor physical and mental health, and ties to Islamic extremism,” the report states, adding that there was a sophisticated organization to widely distribute that propaganda on the Internet through “professional trolls.”“The likely financier of the so-called Internet Research Agency of professional trolls located in Saint Petersburg is a close Putin ally with ties to Russian intelligence,” the report says.Trolls were located in other areas, as well, including Macedonia, where an unusual number of pro-Trump websites were registered.The number of people involved in the effort is not detailed in the Jan. 6 report, which is an unclassified version of a highly classified assessment. Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, in March said there may have been 1,000 such trolls.If Putin did have that many people working to elect Trump, his operation was more than twice as large as the Trump campaign’s paid staff in the final weeks before the election. And if each Putin cybersoldier was paid just $10,000 over the course of the year, that would put Russia’s expenditure on its pro-Trump propaganda at $10 million, making Putin one of Trump’s biggest financial supporters.Robert Maguire, with the Center for Responsive Politics, said the situation is similar to rich donors funneling large contributions to secret-money political groups to buy ads.“The main difference here is that you have a foreign government paying for the creation of stories that get picked up little by little by various news outlets, and in some cases by the candidate himself from the podium,” Maguire said. “Obviously, the aim was to influence, but man, this is so beyond anything we’ve ever seen before. I mean, where do you even start with that?”Spending even a single dollar on any type of ad telling voters to support Trump or oppose Clinton would have been illegal for Russia, as foreign entities are prohibited from participating in federal elections.But the invention of false news and posting or reposting it on websites without paying advertising fees – that is not explicitly outlawed.“We used to talk about illegally coordinating with Americans. The idea that they might have coordinated with a foreign government is mind-boggling,” Maguire said. “I don’t think I have the capacity to be surprised anymore.”Brendan Fischer, with the Campaign Legal Center, said he supports a broader interpretation of a particular law that be believes makes sense in this instance. Paying a Macedonian teenager to write a fake blog post and then repost it under a number of fake identities, Fischer said, shows clear intent to influence the election. “I would call that an expenditure,” a term of art in campaign finance law prohibited for foreigners, he said.Of course, according to U.S. intelligence, Russian agents obviously committed serious crimes when they stole emails from the Democratic National Committee and from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta for release through the WikiLeaks website.In that act, as well as the disinformation campaign, a fundamental problem for prosecutors going after Russians or Macedonians or anyone outside the United States is the practicality of bringing them to trial.“It’s going to be hard to prosecute anyone overseas,” Fischer said. “I would presume that the ones to be prosecuted would be the ones in the United States.”"
24,MEDIA,NRA Claims The Washington Post Is Where 'Journalism Dies',Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nra-washington-post-video_us_596d3b32e4b0e983c0586e4a,The pro-gun group’s disturbing new video accuses the newspaper of fueling anarchy.,2017-07-17,The NRA video twisted The Washington Post's striking slogan.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/596d3eb71500002000bfe03e.png?cache=oJwMaSwdkd&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A disturbing National Rifle Association video, published on Monday, accuses The Washington Post of helping fuel “organized anarchy of the violent left” by spreading lies.“You people do more to damage our country with a keyboard than every NRA member combined has ever done with a firearm,” conservative talk show host Grant Stinchfield says in the video commentary. “Your paper’s new slogan may read ‘Democracy Dies in Darkness.’ It should say ‘Journalism Dies at The Washington Post.’”The NRA’s promotion of Stinchfield’s two-minute rant comes at a precarious time for journalists. President Donald Trump has declared the media the ”enemy of the people,” a characterization straight out of the authoritarian playbook. Reporters increasingly face verbal and even physical attacks for doing their jobs. And news organizations have lately been considering greater security measures. CBS News anchor Scott Pelley asked Trump earlier in the year if he worried that his anti-press rhetoric might lead to a shooting attack in a newsroom. The president did not answer. Although Stinchfield’s video commentary doesn’t explicitly call for violence against the press, New York Times writer Max Fisher described the video as “edging right up to the line of endorsing violence against journalists,” in particular against Post reporter and Iraq War veteran Alex Horton.“Video repeatedly names the journalist, presents him as acting outside the law & a dangerous threat to gun-owners, and uses violent symbolism,” Fisher tweeted. “What is the point of all that, particularly the repeated use of violent imagery and vigilante metaphors, except to wink-wink-nudge-nudge?” In the video, Stinchfield claims that The Washington Post has “tarnished gun owners in an effort to take away our Second Amendment freedoms” and specifically calls out Horton for describing another recent NRA video as ”dark.” The earlier video, featuring NRA commentator Dom Raso, similarly tied the media, Democrats, and activists together in a conspiracy to create “organized anarchy” in America.The Washington Post declined to comment on the latest video.But Natalie Jennings, a Post editor, noted on Twitter that “Zero facts to refute our reporting were presented in this video.” And Horton questioned the message behind Stinchfield’s “stern warning” to the paper.“Warning of what?” Horton asked."

The Chilean capital was blanketed in a layer of snow measuring up to two inches, reportedly the heaviest snowfall the city has experienced since 2007. The frosty conditions wreaked havoc in the city where snow rarely falls. More than 250,000 residents were left without power as falling trees and branches downed power lines, according to the AFP. That left thousands of people in the dark and without heat on a day when temperatures dipped below freezing. One worker died while clearing ice and two people were injured after being electrocuted by a fallen power line, reported the BBC.

He had been serving an 11-year sentence for sedition after being arrested in 2009 for promoting a pro-democracy manifesto called Charter 08.“This is too evil, too evil,” exiled author Liao Yiwu told the Guardian in reaction to Liu’s cremation and sea burial. “The regime must be insane,” said Mo Zhixu, another activist. Artist Ai Weiwei had similarly pointed words, posting this on Twitter:A handful of family members, including Liu’s wife, Liu Xia, attended the small funeral service on Saturday morning. Liu Xia has been under house arrest since her husband’s imprisonment, though she has never been formally charged with a crime, According to an official account of the ceremony provided to The New York Times by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Liu Xia ― who has not spoken publicly about her husband’s death ― approached his body during the ceremony as Mozart’s Requiem played in the background. “She gazed upon him for a long time and murmured her final farewells to her husband,” said the account. She later “received the container of [his] ashes and tightly hugged it to herself.” Liu’s last written work was likely a tribute to his wife, which he penned in his dying days. “Love as intense as ice, love as remote as blackness,” he wrote to her, according to the Times. Concerns have mounted about Liu Xia’s health and well-being in the wake of her husband’s death. A government official said she had been freed, but was so “grief-stricken” that she was shunning contact with the outside world. People who know the Lius, however, say her recent silence is cause for alarm and could indicate that she continues to be under house arrest and intense surveillance.“We have lost touch with her now for three full days,” Jared Genser, a U.S. human rights lawyer who represents the couple, told the Guardian. “I’m incredibly concerned about her health and welfare.” Liu Xia suffers from depression and heart disease, reported the AFP. Her mother died earlier this year; her father died last year. Government officials said Liu’s cremation and sea burial had been what his family had wanted — a statement corroborated by Liu’s eldest brother, Liu Xiaoguang, who said at a news conference Saturday afternoon that he was grateful to “the party and government for completely following the family’s wishes.” The brother, who is believed to have been estranged from Liu, may have been coerced to give the statement, said friends of the dissident.Nicholas Bequelin, regional director of Amnesty International East Asia, slammed the news conference as a “crude” sham.On Saturday, thousands of mourners in Hong Kong took part in a candle-lit vigil in remembrance of Liu. They lauded him as a “great icon” and “people’s hero,” and called for Liu Xia’s freedom.“We’re here to tell [Chinese president] Xi Jinping that Hong Kong people will continue to fight in the spirit of Liu Xiaobo,” protester Lee Cheuk-yan told the Guardian. “The way the funeral was controlled by the Communist Party, it’s very sad to say that Liu Xiaobo cannot be free even in death. But now we must free Liu Xia, because she has already suffered so much.”"

It’s a rather interesting comment to make,” she told the outlet’s host. “I wonder if she could say the same of him?”Bishop’s response follows Trump sizing up the first lady’s physical appearance as she and her husband, French President Emmanuel Macron, hosted him and first lady Melania Trump in Paris on Thursday.Brigitte Macron is 64, while her husband is 39. Melania Trump is 47, while her husband is 71. Bishop turns 61 on Monday.“You’re in such good shape. Such good physical shape. Beautiful,” Trump proclaimed as Brigitte Macron was seen inching closer to Melania Trump.The unsolicited assessment drew scowls and scorn around the world, with sports brand Reebok releasing an easy-to-read chart that points out when it’s appropriate to say “You’re in such good shape … beautiful” and when it’s not. (Spoiler alert: Trump’s decision is in the “no” section.)Just to be fair, Trump’s physical shape was commented on by Pope Francis during the president’s visit to the Vatican with his wife in May. During that exchange, the pope questioned whether the one-time owner of the Miss Universe beauty pageant was eating too many desserts. Bishop’s comment was just the latest shot taken at Trump on the Australian news station.Last week, ABC political editor Chris Uhlmann gave a scathing assessment of Trump’s performance at the G-20 Summit, saying he “managed to diminish his nation and to confuse and alienate his allies.”“We learned that Mr. Trump has pressed fast forward on the decline of the U.S. as a global leader,” he said in his two-minute broadcast.Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull also has had a rocky start with Trump, with the president hanging up on him during their first phone call in February after 25 minutes. They had been scheduled to speak for an hour, the Washington Post reported at the time.“We had a very nice phone call,” Trump said when meeting Turnbull in May. “It got a little bit testy, but that is OK.” In June, a leaked recording captured Turnbull mocking Trump at an off-the-record media event."

Some others in the group, including two Dutch journalists, escaped.Cosma Wilungula, the head of Congo’s park service, confirmed that the journalist and rangers had been rescued from a group of Mai Mai militia fighters involved in mining gold inside the reserve.The U.S. State Department said it was aware of the reports, but did not identify the journalist who was rescued because of privacy concerns.“We are aware of reports that the U.S. citizen reported kidnapped in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has been found safe,” a State Department official said.“The U.S. Department of State has no higher priority than the protection of U.S. citizens overseas. Due to privacy considerations, we have no further comment.‎”Mambasa administrator Alfred Bongwalanga said security forces and park rangers had launched a rescue operation that located the missing members of the group. It was not immediately clear how the rangers were killed.“There are five dead. They are all park rangers who were involved in the operation. They had been backing the army,” he told Reuters by telephone.While Wilungula said two rangers had been killed in the initial attack he had no information on casualties during the rescue.“It’s a zone that’s not secure for us ... They were heavily armed and the rangers found themselves in an inferior position,” Wilungula said, referring to the initial attack.Eastern Congo has been the theater of numerous wars and uprisings over the last two decades, and rebels, militia fighters and bandits still present a security risk in many areas.Park rangers trying to protect dwindling populations of elephants and gorillas often clash with poachers and other armed groups who exploit minerals, wildlife and other resources.Later on Sunday Congo’s Virunga National Park said that one of its rangers, Dudunyabo Machongani Célestin, had died following an ambush by Mai Mai militia in an area of the park west of Lake Edward.

Jerry Brown urged ahead of the vote.",2017-07-16,"Brown, increasingly the face of the U.S. climate efforts abroad, attends the Clean Energy Ministerial international forum in Beijing on June 6, 2017",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/596bdf011a00003400dbf06b.jpeg?cache=DYynjFcKjm&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"California lawmakers voted Monday to renew the state’s milestone climate legislation, ending uncertainty about the fate of a cap-and-trade program criticized by both liberals and conservatives.The bill required a supermajority in both houses to move forward. It passed with 28 votes in the Senate, one more than was necessary. Republican Sen. Tom Berryhill (R-Modesto) was the lone Republican Senator to cast a vote in favor of the legislation. It passed Monday evening with 55 votes in the Assembly, one more than the 54 required. The program would have collapsed in 2020 without lawmakers voting to renew it. Gov. Jerry Brown sought to ensure its expansion until 2030, making it clear that California will continue the fight against climate change in spite of President Donald Trump reneging on national commitments to it. In the face of Trump backing out of the Paris Agreement on climate change and going “AWOL” on the subject, Brown said earlier this month that California will host its own climate summit next year.“Cap-and-trade is the way forward,” Brown said in an impassioned speech at a hearing for the bill Thursday. “I know we’ve got politics; they have everybody on different sides. This is fundamental,” he said, calling climate change a “threat to organized human existence.”Brown warned of a future where the massive wildfires ravaging the state in recent weeks and other climate-caused catastrophes are the new normal. More than a dozen wildfires have scorched California in recent days, including the ever-growing Whittier fire in Santa Barbara County, which has burned more than 18,000 acres since igniting more than a week ago. Wildfires this catastrophic, scientists warn, will only become more frequent as global temperatures rise. “You’re going to be alive in a horrible situation where you’re going to see mass migrations, vector diseases, forest fires, Southern California burning up,” he urged. “That’s real, guys. That’s what the scientists of the world are saying. I’m not here about some cockamamie legacy that some people talk about. This isn’t for me. I’m going to be dead. It’s for you.”Brown sought to pass the legislation with a super-majority, or two-thirds, vote in order to protect the program from future legal threats. But achieving that was an uphill battle, even as Democrats control the legislative body. With Assemblywoman Jacqui Irwin (D-Thousand Oaks) out all week, The Los Angeles Times noted, cap-and-trade’s security hinged on winning at least one Republican vote.While many GOP lawmakers opposed the bill’s taxes and increased regulatory efforts, securing some Republican votes was not out of reach. However, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle faced pressure from environmental justice groups, which say the bill is too friendly to the oil industry and doesn’t go far enough to protect citizens from pollution.“Governor Brown wants to give the oil and gas industry a pass to pollute for another decade,” Food & Water Watch California director Adam Scow said in a statement to HuffPost. “This bill, that is supported by Sempra Energy and the fossil fuel industry, makes a mockery of California’s climate leadership,” Opposition to the bill largely centered on the limits it imposes on the state’s Air Resources Board and its ability to protect people who live near pollution sites. Under AB 398, the board would not be allowed to regulate carbon emissions from sources that are subject to the cap-and-trade program.But Brown said letting cap-and-trade take the lead and avoiding “intrusive commanding control” from the Air Resources Board is essential for ensuring climate change efforts stay affordable and avoiding the short-term consequences of higher gas and food prices.AB 617, a companion bill that requires upgrades for outdated equipment and creates stricter penalties for violations, addresses some of those concerns, but critics say it doesn’t undo the problems caused by AB 398. AB 617 also passed the Senate on Monday.The Natural Resources Defense Council is one of the environmental groups that supported the bill, despite such limits on the Air Resources Board and other concessions to the gas and oil industry being “bitter pills” to swallow. They’re joined by the Environmental Defense Fund and NextGen Climate, among other groups.“[O]n balance the package ensures our emissions limits are enforceable against polluters and secures critical gains to improve air quality for millions of Californians,” Alex Jackson, the legal director of group’s California climate project, said in a statement last week. “The world is watching for California to chart a path through the climate denial and obstruction coming from the White House – and California is yet again poised to deliver.”This article has been updated to include the Senate and Assembly votes.CORRECTION: A previous version mistakenly identified the Coalition for Clean Air as being against AB 398."

Much of the media coverage framed this as a choice between supporting either the rights of sexual assault survivors or the rights of the accused. This is a false choice, and the dialogue would be better framed as finding a way to balance the rights of all involved.Adding due process protections doesn’t have the effect of rolling back victims’ rights, Laura L. Dunn, Esq., Executive Director of SurvJustice, which provides legal help to student victims, told the Chronicle of Higher Education. “I’m fine with due process being hand-in-hand with civil rights,” Ms. Dunn said. “I think a lot of people are surprised sometimes to hear a group like SurvJustice, who are victims’ rights attorneys helping in campus hearings, is so supportive of due process rights,” she told The Weekly Standard. But when a respondent’s due process rights are violated, a civil court is likely to remand the case—requiring the survivor to repeat the process and delaying the finality complainants seek, Dunn explained.As someone who has spent my career of nearly thirty years advocating for crime victims’ rights, and for the last ten years advising colleges and universities on meeting federal campus safety guidelines I’ve seen firsthand the consequences when an institution fails to uphold the due process rights of the accused. Not only can justice be delayed, but in some cases any protection a survivor received can be undone, and the institution may face costly civil litigation by both parties. At state institutions, due process rights are guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution, and no law or agency guidance supersedes these protections so upholding them is essential for justice not only for the accused, but the survivor as well.While due process is guaranteed, it is also important to understand that campus proceedings are not criminal. They find students or employees responsible for violating campus codes of conduct. The strongest sanctions are expulsion for students or termination for employees. As such courts have not applied criminal standards. A federal court, for example, in Dixon v. Alabama State Bd. of Educ., 294 F.2d 150, 159 (1961) held that institutional disciplinary proceedings do not need to be like criminal trials or engage in “full-dress” judicial proceedings. “Nevertheless, the rudiments of an adversary proceeding may be preserved without encroaching upon the interests of the college.”These college and university disciplinary proceedings historically did not favor survivors, as examined in detail by the Center for Public Integrity in 2009 and 2010. It was this investigation which in large part led to the Obama Administration stepping up enforcement of Title IX to even the scales of justice.As one of the advocates, then serving as Director of Public Policy for the non-profit Security On Campus, Inc. (now the Clery Center), asking the government for better enforcement of Title IX, it was not our intent to right one injustice with another. That should not happen now either. Hopefully Secretary DeVos will move forward by seeking to balance the rights of all involved in these proceedings, and not go backwards rolling-back important protections for survivors."

Many believed the series glamorized suicide, and portrayed parents and school counselors as aloof; while others, myself included, credited the show with raising awareness to acute suicidal states in white, middle class America. Only 4 months later, Netflix is again walking the fine line between glamorizing eating disorders, or depicting them as pervasive monsters with a relentless grip. Again, I exist within the population who believes the film raises awareness, and does everything but glamorize eating disorders.That I watched the film on its release date of July 14 2017 was not happenstance. I have recently begun treating a 24 year-old client who has fluctuated between Anorexia and Bulimia since age nine, and have enhanced familiarity with binge/purge compulsion, and the voice of a harsh superego capable of reducing the afflicted to chyme.Marti Noxon, of whose Girlfriends Guide to Divorce I am a fan, directed the film, and Lili Collins, daughter of Phil Collins, is Ellen, whose dysfunctional family not only catalyzes the withering of her body, but of her ego. My goal is not to review the film, but to testify to its accurate portrayal of causes, dynamics, and necessary components of healing. What veers the film away from glamorizing eating disorders is its graphic depictions of their effects on the whole person.Early in the film, Ellen rigorously executes crunches on her hardwood, bedroom floor. What could otherwise be viewed as an innocuous exercise session morphs into self-abuse when a camera shift to Ellen’s back reveals a cluster of bruises on her spinal column. The scene reveals injury many of us would not consider when we conceptualize harm done to the body by obsessive exercise. During Ellen’s physical examinations, our eyes are assaulted by closeups of protruding shoulder blades, and ribs. This is not the stuff of “glamorizing.” Ellen seizes no joy from her illness; unless joy is defined by self-destruction, and perceived unworthiness born of an absent father and mentally ill, unattached mother.The film also explores typical unintended ignorance evidenced by a family member who implores Ellen to “just eat”, and a stepmother who stares at residents in the clinic at which Ellen reluctantly agrees to seek treatment as if they were sideshow freaks. Hopefully, these depictions raise awareness to people in support roles.Another important element touched upon within the clinic is the phenomenon of patients sharing tricks of the trade more likely to facilitate pathology than healing. For example, one character hides a “puke bag” under her bed, while another drinks water from a bathroom tap prior to a weigh in. Those revelations mirror what my client has described to me about her own stay in a clinic, and also underscores shame that catalyzes a need for clandestine behavior.To the Bone further addresses severe implications of eating disorders by portraying a character forced to endure a feeding tube down her throat, and who panics at the revelation the average drip bag contains 1500 calories. Meanwhile, in the film’s most disturbing sequence, a pregnant patient suffers a miscarries on a bathroom floor mere hours after fellow residents give her a baby shower. Again, not glamorous.I grew worried the film would succumb to cliche with the introduction of a doctor played by Keanu Reeves. I feared his character would fall into the Robin Williams in Good Will Hunting category; the lone oracle distinguished by his ability to lead patients to a moment of enlightenment, and change. Thankfully, the “it’s not your fault” moment never happens. While the doctor does utilize some unorthodox methods, he struggles to promote healing because Ellen’s family is not there, and familial support is so crucial to the process of healing, and the maintenance of stability.The notion that healing is catalyzed by resolution of old psychic wounds spurs the “bottle scene”, the emotional impact of which can only be experienced by viewing. After prematurely leaving the clinic, Ellen receives her “wake up call” through a dream sequence during which she sees her own emaciation and death. It’s a cliched sequence, but serves its purpose as Ellen buses it to Phoenix to confront her pain, and her mother. The scene says everything about the necessity of early object relations, and how connection with a primary caregiver is prerequisite to connection to others. In the scene, Ellen allows herself to feel emotion buried under years of disorder, and although she experiences catharsis, the moment is not a panacea. Ellen still needs to repair her cognitive distortions, if her behavior is to change.The necessity of said work leads her back to the clinic, this time under her own volition, and leads the film to a satisfying conclusion. Noxon could have fast forwarded to Ellen in full recovery, eating a meal at a healthy weight, but she avoids the trope, and instead lets us know the end of the movie is the beginning of the story. When Ellen returns to the clinic, she is no longer to be a bystander to her life, but is ready to claim authorship of her narrative.To the Bone is by no means a glamorization of eating disorders, but it does provide viewers opportunity to see the glamour in hope, healing, and human connection. Watch the movie, and keep the conversation going.If you’re struggling with an eating disorder, call the National Eating Disorder Association hotline at 1-800-931-2237."

TMZ reports that Carter refused to submit for testing for suspected DUI.Carter’s girlfriend, Madison Parker, was in the vehicle and was charged with obstruction and two drug-related charges.Hours before Carter’s arrest, a message appeared from his Twitter account informing fans that, due to “transportation issues,” the singer would not be able to make a scheduled performance in Kansas City.In 2016, Carter opened up to Entertainment Tonight about his monthlong stay at the Betty Ford Center in 2011, dismissing “misconceptions” that “I’m a meth head, or I’m a crackhead, or I’m a drug addict.”“I drink wine,” he said. “I smoke weed.

Because his Green Lantern T-shirt and shorts were in clear violation of the event’s strict all-white dress code, Clijsters retrieved a white skirt from her bag and helped him slip it over his shorts.Quinn ended up doing better than many may have expected, with him managing to return her serve during his first try.He later expressed his appreciation to Clijsters on Twitter, while sharing that his daughters are big fans of hers."

Klan chapters, neo-Nazi groups and racist skinhead gangs are easy calls.But our critics contend that we’re mixing apples and oranges when we include groups that are closer to the mainstream and that don’t advocate violence – groups like the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) and the Family Research Council (FRC).We disagree. Indeed, we think it’s more important to call out hate groups that operate in the mainstream than those that operate at the fringes. At their root, hate groups – those that have “beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics” – are anti-democratic. Like hate crimes, they rip apart society along its most fragile fault lines – lines such as race, ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation. CIS is a case in point. It’s a group whose immigration agenda is colored by ethnic bias. Part of a network of anti-immigration groups founded by white supremacist John Tanton, CIS has disseminated more than 1,700 articles from VDARE, a racist website and hub for white nationalists over the past decade. Hundreds of other articles came from leading racists and anti-Semites like Kevin McDonald, a former psychology professor who argues that Jews are genetically driven to destroy Western civilization. And, incredibly, after the devastating 2010 earthquake in Haiti, CIS President Mark Krikorian wrote, “My guess is that Haiti’s so screwed up because it wasn’t colonized long enough.” The FRC is an even easier call.It has a long track record of using dehumanizing language and outright lies to portray LGBT people as sick, evil, and a danger to children and society. As stated on its website, it opposes the acceptance of homosexuality “in the law, in the media, and in schools.” In other words, LGBT people should not have the same rights and protections as everyone else.FRC President Tony Perkins claims that pedophilia is a “homosexual problem” – even though the American Psychological Association has concluded that gay men are no more likely than straight men to molest children. He has said the “It Gets Better” campaign, an initiative designed to give LGBT students hope, is “disgusting” and part of a “concerted effort” to “recruit” children into the gay “lifestyle.” He once voiced support for a proposed law in Uganda that would mean a life sentence for anyone caught having gay sex and the death penalty in certain cases involving homosexuality. The FRC may not advocate violence, but its inflammatory rhetoric pours fuel on the fires of hate. FBI statistics show that the LGBT community is, by far, the minority group most likely to be targeted for violent hate crimes.Perkins also doesn’t like Muslims. On his radio show in 2014, he claimed that the U.S. Constitution doesn’t protect their religious rights. He added that Muslims who don’t commit extremist violence “don’t really believe the Quran or practice it as its written.” In other words, faithful Muslims are, by definition, terrorists.The CIS and FRC are certainly closer to the mainstream than groups like the neo-Nazi National Alliance. But that does not mean they don’t sow the seeds of hate. In fact, it means they have bigger, more powerful megaphones to spread their divisive, anti-democratic message. And that’s all the more reason to call them out."

The Passaic County Prosecutor’s Office in Paterson confirmed to the Paterson Press that the officer in the video is a member of the Passaic County Sheriff’s Office. The prosecutor’s office said they were reviewing the footage, apparently filmed by the vehicle’s owner. The undated video, which went viral on Friday, shows a plainclothes officer in a red shirt looking through the trunk of the van. When the man who is filming asks the officer why he’s in his car, the officer shuts the trunk door and walks away.As heard in the video, the man accuses the officer of searching his car illegally and tells the officer that he knows his rights.William Maer, a spokesman for the sheriff’s office, told the Paterson Times the matter has been referred to the prosecutor’s office “in an effort to assure an independent investigation of the circumstances around the video.” The sheriff’s office would not identify the officer in the video.Maer did not reveal whether anyone was arrested in the incident. The date the video was filmed also is unclearThe Facebook page Mediatakeout shared the video, which has been viewed more than 1.7 million times. When the man filming asks the officer, “What the fuck is you doing, yo ... What is you in my van for,” the officer shuts the van’s rear door and walks away.The officer, still walking away, tells the man filming to follow him, but the man refuses. The man asks the officer again, “What is you in my car for when I’m sitting down eating with my family?”The officer tells the man that “we’re getting a lot of complaints about guns,” to which the man replies, “Listen, I don’t care about none of that. What are you in my van for?”When the man asks the officer how he accessed his trunk, the officer replies, “It’s open. It’s wide open.”“Still. Still,” the man filming says in return. “You’re not supposed to be in my van sir.”After the plainclothes cop is joined by a uniformed officer, the man asks the officers for their names and badge numbers.“Y’all doing shit that y’all ain’t supposed to be fucking doing,” the man says while filming the license plates of police cars. “I know my rights.”Ed Barocas, legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, called the footage “troubling and disturbing,” in an interview with the Paterson Times.“You have an individual who appears to be a law enforcement officer entering someone’s vehicle without permission and seemingly without any lawful authority,” Barocas told the online news site. “Not only is it improper, it’s a crime.”Although the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects Americans against unreasonable searches and seizures, New Jersey police officers may search vehicles without a warrant or the owner’s permission if they believe probable cause exists that a crime has been or is being committed.In 2015, the New Jersey Supreme Court overturned one of its previous rulings and relaxed the standards for warrantless searches by police officers."

40,HEALTHY LIVING,More Than 100 People Overdosed On Synthetic Marijuana In One Pennsylvania County,Dominique Mosbergen,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/synthetic-marijuana-overdoses-lancaster-pennsylvania_us_596b5930e4b01741862816ee,The drug is far more dangerous than real cannabis.,2017-07-16,"Synthetic marijuana, sold in colorful packages with names like Cloud Nine, Maui Wowie and Mr. Nice Guy, on display behind the glass counter at a Kwik Stop in Hollywood, Florida.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/596b60c81500006303bfdca7.jpeg?cache=p1ftYmMZmT&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Over just three days in a single Pennsylvania county this month, more than a hundred people reportedly overdosed on a type of synthetic marijuana known as K2.Between July 7 and July 10, 102 people in Lancaster County were treated for K2 overdoses, according to CNN. By July 14, an additional 56 people suffered similar afflications, bringing the total number of K2 overdose patients in the county to 158 in just one week. C. Robert May, director of Lancaster Emergency Medical Services, said none of the overdoses were fatal but patients’ symptoms were sometimes serious. “We’re seeing very sick patients, individuals who have very low blood pressure, are unconscious, and they’re getting admitted to intensive care,” May told CBS News. He added that the influx of overdose patients was “taxing” to local hospitals that are already “well above capacity.”Asked to explain the troubling increase, May said a dip in the availability of heroin may have contributed to a spike in demand for the synthetic drug. Either that, he said, or “just some bad K2 has hit the street.”Unlike real marijuana, which is an organic drug that has never been reported as the sole cause of a fatal overdose, synthetic marijuana can be very dangerous and even deadly. Typically composed of shredded plant material sprayed with lab-made cannabinoids ― the same psychoactive compound found in organic weed — synthetic marijuana is “far more powerful” than the real McCoy, Barbra Roach, a Denver-based special agent at the Drug Enforcement Administration, said in an earlier HuffPost interview. It’s often impossible, however, to tell just how strong a dose of synthetic marijuana will be.“[Some] could be 1-to-800 times more powerful, some are 25 times more powerful, some are 5 times,” said Roach. “Because it’s lab-created, [the drug’s makers] are constantly trying to change the analogs in it and the compounds so it’s like an unknown and then it’s not technically illegal, at least under federal law.” According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the chemical composition can differ wildly between different batches of synthetic marijuana — which, other than the moniker K2, is also sold under brand names including Spice, Black Mamba, Kush and Kronic. As a result, “these products are likely to contain substances that cause dramatically different effects than the user might expect,” the institute said.Doctors have repeatedly compared consuming the drug to “playing a game of Russian roulette.” Known side effects include seizures, hallucinations, convulsions and kidney damage, as well as extremely negative psychological effects, such as suicidal tendencies and erratic, violent behavior.Misleadingly marketed as a “legal” or “safer” alternative to real cannabis, synthetic marijuana’s popularity has ballooned in recent years. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the drug has been particularly in-demand among teens and young adults “seeking an alternative to marijuana or a new experience with a hallucinogenic drug.” Many of the overdose patients in Lancaster County this month have been adults in their 20s, said May. Some have been teenagers. "
41,POLITICS,Let's Turn America's Military-Industrial Complex Into A Science-Industrial Complex,"Zoltan Istvan, ContributorLibertarian Candidate for California Governor 2018; Creator of...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lets-turn-americas-military-industrial-complex-into_us_596abf1ee4b06a2c8edb4713,Many Americans subscribe to the annoying belief that our nation’s military-industrial complex is the surest way to remain,2017-07-16,<p>The US Government spends 10 times the amount on defense as it does science.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/596ac5ec1500002300bfdc20.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Many Americans subscribe to the annoying belief that our nation’s military-industrial complex is the surest way to remain the wealthiest and leading superpower in the world. After all, it’s worked for the last century, pro-military supporters love to point out.However, America’s dependence on warmongering may soon become a liability that is impossible to maintain. Transhumanism, globalization, and outright replacement of human soldiers with robots are redefining the country’s military requirements, and they may eventually render defense budgets far smaller than those now. To compensate and keep America spending approximately 20 percent of the federal budget on defense (as we have for most of the last few years), we’ll either have to manufacture wars to use all our newly-made bombs, or find another way to keep the American economy afloat.It just so happens that there is another way — a method that would satisfy liberals and conservatives alike, as well as other politically-minded folks (I’m a libertarian candidate for California governor). Instead of always spending more on our military, we could transition our nation and its economy into a scientific-industrial complex.There’s a compelling reason to do this beyond what meets the eye. Transhumanist technology is starting to radically change human life. Many experts expect to be able to stop aging and conquer death for human beings in the next 25 years. Others, like myself, see humans merging with machines and replacing our organs with bionic ones.Such a new transhuman society will require many trillions of dollars to satisfy humans ever-growing desire for physical perfection (machine or biological) in the transhumanist age. We could keep our economy humming along for decades because of it.Whatever happens, something is going to have to give in the future regarding military profiteering. Part of this is because in the past, the military-industrial complex operated off always keeping a few million U.S. military members ready on a moment’s notice to travel around the world and fight. But there’s almost no scenario where we would need that kind of human-power (and infrastructure to support it) anymore.Increasingly, small teams of special operation soldiers and uber-high tech are the way America fights its wars. We just don’t need massive military bases anymore, nor the thousands of companies to support the constant maintenance of ground troops. Such a reality changes the economics of the military dramatically, and will eventually leave it a fraction of its size in terms of personnel and real estate.The coming military age of automated drones, robot tanks, cyberwarfare, and artificial intelligence just doesn’t require that many peopleWe’ll still have the need for technology to fight the wars and conflicts we entangle ourselves in, but it’ll be mostly engineers, programmers, and technicians who wear the uniform. The coming military age of automated drones, robot tanks, cyberwarfare, and artificial intelligence just doesn’t require that many people. In fact, expect the military not just to shrink, but to mostly disappear into ones and zeroes.Many people think that the beast of a military-industrial complex—made famous by President Dwight Eisenhower’s warning against it in his farewell address — appeared only in the last 50 years. However, others persuasively argue that America has been at war 93 percent of the time since the U.S. Declaration of Independence was signed in 1776 — so it’s been with us from the beginning.In liberal California where I live, such facts annoy just about everyone I know — except, of course, those who are shareholders and beneficiaries of the defense industry. Thankfully, despite Congress being led by mostly older white religious men, the younger generation clamors for an improved America—one that can keep its economies running smoothly in a more peaceful way.This is where the scientific-industrial complex comes in and could satisfy most everyone. And best of all, a society of science requires actual people. Lots of them: nurses, scientists, start-up CEOs, designers, technologists, and even lawyers. The advent of modern medicine to treat virtually every ailment — and the whole anti-aging movement, in general — affects all 325 million Americans. Over half of us suffer from health issues that can be improved but often aren’t, for a variety of reasons. For example, the U.S. Census Bureau reports that 40 percent of people over the age of 65 suffer from a disability — and for two thirds of them, it’s mobility-related issues. And millions are already racking up the symptoms of heart disease that will kill them. And a younger generation is just waiting to explore bionics, chip implants, and how to upgrade their genes to avoid health problems in the future. All this means we have the fodder to reshape the American economy from a militaristic-based one to a type that thrives off scientific and medical innovation.Instead of spending American money on sending our soldiers to risk their lives for the whims of war, we could be giving civilians the medicine and healthcare they need to live far better and longer. And living longer has unseen benefits, too. In the future, bonafide transhumans won’t have to retire if they don’t want to. Their bodies will be ageless and made so strong through technology that work and careers may continue indefinitely — and therefore, they’ll be able to continue contributing to the economy indefinitely. Transhuman existence is a self-fulfilling economic-boom prophesy for both individual and country.Currently, the U.S. Constitution (which I personally think needs a significant rewrite for the 21st century) is overly concerned with protection of national sovereignty—which is one major reason why the military-industrial complex is allowed to grow undeterred. If the U.S. Constitution was endowed with precise wording to also protect an individual’s health, well-being, and longevity, then a scientific-industrial complex could rise. This new cultural and legal reform would help to provide the most modern medicine, technology, and science possible to its people. And since I believe interpretation of the non-aggression principle should include harmful natural phenomena — like aging, existential risk, and disease — I believe minarchist values could support limited government to help people overcome these things.Shamefully, the Iraq War will cost the U.S. approximately $6 trillion dollars by the time we’re actually done paying all our bills — despite the fact that it’s highly questionable whether Iraq was ever even a serious national security issue. However, our country undeniably faces a serious national security issue today — in fact, I’d call it a full blown crisis. Nearly 7,000 Americans will die in the next 24 hours from cancer, heart disease, diabetes, aging, and other issues. And the same amount of people will die tomorrow and the day after.Overcoming disease and aging in the transhuman age will inevitably occur. The question is not if, but when? The answer lies in how much our nation is willing to spend on scientific and medical research — and how soon. But so long as it continues to spend money on the military instead of citizen’s health, human beings will die — which is ironic since it’s the military that is supposed to protect us (and not inadvertently sabotage us by swallowing funding for bombs instead of medicine). All we need do as a country is change the direction of our spending, from defense to science. If we can transform America into a scientific-industrial complex, we’ll still be able to keep our economy chugging along. Let America’s new wars be fought against cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer’s, and aging itself. It’s a win-win, except for body bag and casket makers."

You can mess with, maybe Miss Universe. Maybe I will even congratulate you for having the balls to rape somebody when you know you are going to die,” Duterte said, according to translations by local media.Duterte became president in late June 2016. Little more than a year later, his internationally condemned war on drugs has already resulted in thousands of extrajudicial killings and mass human rights abuses. The 72-year-old’s comments about rape are disturbing, but far from uncharacteristic.While campaigning for the presidency in April 2016, Duterte made horrific remarks about an Australian missionary who was gang-raped and murdered during a 1989 prison riot in Davao, while he served as mayor.“I saw her face and I thought: Son of a bitch. What a pity ... they raped her, they all lined up. I was mad she was raped but she was so beautiful. I thought, the mayor should have been first,” he said, later telling critics that his words were not meant as a joke and refusing to apologize.In May, the president told his soldiers that he would let them get away with committing up to three rapes each. “Just do your job. I will take care of the rest. I will go to jail for you. If you rape three, I will admit it,” he said. And when Duterte’s own daughter publicly announced last year that she was a victim of rape, he reportedly dismissed her claim by calling her a “drama queen.”"

45,POLITICS,Think Obamacare Repeal Won't Affect Kids? Think Again.,Jonathan Cohn,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obamacare-repeal-kids_us_595ffad6e4b0615b9e91a4b2,Flint and its water crisis offer a case study in the program's value to children.,2017-07-15,"Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, the Hurley Medical Center physician who helped expose the Flint water crisis.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/596016092100003700fc5e28.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"FLINT, Michigan ― Republicans eager to justify the severe Medicaid cuts in their Obamacare repeal proposals have offered up a number of arguments. They say Medicaid doesn’t contribute to better health, or that it doesn’t offer value to its beneficiaries. They also say the proposed cuts would affect only able-bodied adults, sparing groups like low-income children that Medicaid has traditionally served.Those claims don’t hold up well to scrutiny. Relative to people with no health coverage, Medicaid recipients end up more financially secure and have better access to care, according to a body of research that stretches back decades. And while the evidence of Medicaid’s health effects is more ambiguous, most well-respected experts believe it helps and, in the aggregate, may even save thousands of lives a year.But for a more poignant demonstration of why repeal advocates are wrong about Medicaid, it helps to see the impact Medicaid can have on a community ― the different ways it supports vulnerable groups, especially children, and just how much those groups would suffer if Republican legislation were to pass.One of those communities is Flint.Most people know about the contamination of the city’s drinking water, which attracted national attention in the late summer and early fall of 2015. Few people know about the role Medicaid played in exposing it. Residents began complaining about foul-looking and tasting drinking water shortly after state officials, who had taken charge of the city’s finances, decided to take water directly from the Flint River rather than from Lake Huron. But even after an outside researcher at Virginia Tech found evidence that the river water lacked critical anti-corrosive additives to prevent lead from leaching from the pipes, officials continued to insist the water was safe to drink.That’s when Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, a pediatrician and public health researcher at the city’s Hurley Medical Center, started pulling blood testing data from the hospital’s electronic medical records. Those records showed that the number of children with above-average lead levels had risen by more than 100 percent since Flint switched its water source, with particularly high increases in certain zip codes. The data existed because of Medicaid ― specifically, because of the program’s Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment, or EPSDT initiative, which requires and finances extra medical testing for low-income children. Congress added EPSDT to Medicaid in the late 1960s, shortly after the program’s creation, because both Head Start programs and Vietnam draft boards were reporting high incidences of health problems that had gone undetected and untreated. Lead, a toxin that causes severe, irreversible damage to the developing brains of young children, is precisely the sort of hazard EPSDT was designed to detect. Hanna-Attisha’s research drew national attention to the crisis, and after briefly attempting to deny her findings, state officials finally admitted she was right. “Without that data,” Hanna-Attisha told HuffPost recently, “I have no idea where we would be.” Today, Flint is back to drawing its water from Lake Huron, and the lead levels in the water supply are down, if not yet to where they should be. But Medicaid continues to play a critical role in the well-being of Flint’s children. That’s partly because Medicaid is doing for Flint what it did for New Yorkers following the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, and for Gulf Coast residents after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 ― serving as an emergency source of health coverage for anybody in need of help. Thanks to a special waiver that state officials sought and federal officials approved after the crisis became public, Michigan’s version of Medicaid is now open to all Flint-area children and pregnant women in households with incomes up to four times the poverty line. The same waiver also allows Michigan’s Medicaid program to offer special case management services ― “Medicaid on steroids,” as Hanna-Attisha calls it ― providing counselors who can coordinate the mental and physical health services that kids and pregnant women who ingested lead-tainted water might need. The waiver has added approximately 15,000 more people to the Medicaid rolls in Flint, on top of the 30,000 who were already part of the program. A substantial number of those 30,000 people qualified for the program because Michigan opted to join the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion, taking advantage of extra federal matching funds to extend its Medicaid program to households making below or just above the poverty line. For a family of four, the annual income cutoff is $32,718. Michigan’s decision to expand Medicaid helps explain why the number of people without insurance in and around Flint has fallen to roughly half of what it was in 2010.But coverage numbers alone don’t fully capture what the expansion has meant for low-income communities, because all that money from Washington has a secondary effect. It boosts the finances of clinics and hospitals, allowing them to expand capacity ― which can mean hiring staff to see more people, providing more services, or both. That’s exactly what’s happened in Flint, where Hurley, the city’s only academic medical center and safety-net hospital, opened a new downtown clinic for children last year. The Hurley Children’s Center provides a lot more than basic medical care. Parents can get everything from breastfeeding training to counseling on how to handle difficult children. Kids leave their appointments with free books, which they pick out from the shelves, and $10 vouchers they can spend on fresh produce at the Flint Farmer’s Market next door. These “food prescriptions” are part of a major initiative to improve nutrition. Whether they will actually make a difference remains an open question. Hurley staff members are studying the results in real time to see whether the children develop better eating habits and, more importantly, better health. But the program is a reminder of the vast opportunities clinics like Hurley’s have to influence the behavior of children at a young age, forming better lifetime habits, if they have the resources to do so. And although private philanthropy provides significant support for these efforts, it can’t do the job alone. “What we do for children impacts their life trajectory ― and that would be impossible without Medicaid,” Hanna-Attisha said.Now, that sort of progress is in jeopardy. The Better Care Reconciliation Act, the bill Senate Republican leaders hope to bring to a vote this month, in its current form would cut off the extra federal matching funds that states like Michigan used to expand eligibility. The Senate bill would also also change the way the federal government calculates its Medicaid payments to the states, by tying future payments to inflation.That new formula would almost certainly create a gap between the funding states need to maintain their current level of coverage and the funding they would get from Washington. Overall, the Republican bill would reduce federal spending on Medicaid by $772 billion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.Under pressure to close the funding shortfall once the expansion money goes away, and then under added pressure as the program’s new spending formula kicks in, states would almost certainly seek to reduce the scope of their Medicaid programs. They would likely do this through some combination of reducing payments to providers, limiting eligibility for the program, or narrowing the scope of services that Medicaid covers. That is bound to have an impact on safety net providers, because they rely heavily on Medicaid to finance their operations. One estimate by experts at the Commonwealth Fund determined that Medicaid cuts in the House version of Republicans’ health care legislation would reduce net income for safety net hospitals by 83 percent in 2026. And the cuts in the House bill would actually be smaller than what the Senate bill proposes. At Hurley, nearly half the patients are on Medicaid and many of the rest have no coverage at all, which means significant changes in revenue from the program would be difficult for administrators to handle. “As an organization, we would have to review and potentially streamline existing programs and facilities, across our landscape,” Cass Wisniewski, Hurley’s chief financial officer, told HuffPost. “These reductions would curtail any positive growth and progress that we have accomplished over the last four years.”Medicaid, like all large programs, has real problems that need attention. And although the program is more thrifty than either Medicare or private insurance, in the sense that it pays less for equivalent services, it is taking up an ever-larger share of the federal budget.The expansion itself isn’t a net drain on federal finances, because the Affordable Care Act raised taxes and cut spending elsewhere to offset the cost. Over time, however, allowing Medicaid to keep doing what it’s doing ― for the children of Flint and for kids around the country more generally ― would require some combination of enacting new taxes and spending cuts, accepting higher deficits, and (ideally) finding ways to control the underlying cost of health care that makes it so expensive for everybody.None of those changes would be easy to make, and to many conservatives, they would be ill-advised ― in part because, as the argument goes, all of those extra taxes end up depressing the economy in ways that ultimately hurt poor people more than health insurance helps them. But it’s hardly clear that Medicaid actually has negative economic effects, particularly since providing health care can also have positive economic effects ― especially in the long run and especially for children. Spending a little money up front to gather data that ultimately helps prevent lead poisoning in kids, for example, yields clear financial returns in the future. The kids will grow up with fewer mental and physical problems that require treatment and be able to earn a lot more money as working adults. Not that such an investment needs to pay off financially. Although the architects of Medicaid hoped it would yield economic benefits, their primary goal was a moral one: “to give every child the chance to fulfill his promise,” as President Lyndon Johnson put it.Fifty years later, staff members talk about Hurley’s mission in similar terms ― as a place that does more than simply treat disease, or even promote good health.“This is their place, a place where they can see hope,” Dr. Zain Alamarat, the chief pediatric resident, said of the kids she sees. “We can plant the seed ― ‘Somebody listens to me, somebody cares about me.’ And if you can plant that seed in kids, then you can change a generation.”"

The body of Sebastian is idealized in form, with a likeness to ancient Greek sculpture, as well as to gay pornographic imagery. Sebastian’s portrayal is often affiliated with that of lust and homosexual desire. He is in pain but appears to be reveling in a state of ecstasy. While not explicitly illustrated in this exhibition, these images of Saint Sebastian provided a framework with which to understand the nuances of gay imagery and its legacy in contemporary gay culture. The exhibition also includes photographs of textiles, in an attempt to draw connections between the smoothness of the skin and the softness of the fabric. These specific fabrics were selected because of they are commonly associated with femininity, which too, serves to disrupt traditional notions of masculinity when exhibited alongside images of nude men. It is my hope that visitors to the exhibition will consider how our understanding of masculinity is shaped by social norms and culture. When reframing masculinity within a non-heteronormative space, our understanding of these images may, or may not change.

(Read To The End),"Rodney Wilson, ContributorTeacher",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-media-must-go-read-to-the-end_us_596a5b06e4b09e26b6d7685d,"Sometimes, it’s all about which word we use. Remember the confusion when Kentuckians were asked their opinions about Obamacare",2017-07-15,"<p>Press Secretary Sean Spicer faces the free press, June 20, 2017. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/596a5b5c1a00003600dbee82.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sometimes, it’s all about which word we use. Remember the confusion when Kentuckians were asked their opinions about Obamacare and Kynect? In that 2014 poll, 57 percent of Kentuckians viewed Obamacare unfavorably, while only 22 percent had an unfavorable outlook about Kynect. Never mind that Obamacare and Kynect are one and the same. Never mind that Kentucky has benefited more than most states from the ACA. Kynect felt good; Obamacare felt bad. Jimmy Kimmel got a lot of laughs out of this ACA-Obamacare confusion. He sent cameras out to ask citizens which they preferred: Obamacare or the ACA. The answers revealed two things: 1) there’s a lot of puzzlement in the land — a nice way of saying there are too many poorly informed citizens out there; and 2) what one thinks about Obama makes a big difference in what one thinks about Obamacare. Take this remark from Kimmel’s show earlier this year: “I'm not the biggest fan of Obama so I don't support him in the Obama things that he's got going on. I'm actually really excited for President Elect Donald Trump."" That interviewee, no surprise, preferred the ACA over Obamacare. (Insert facepalm here.) Republicans branded the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as “Obamacare” because they knew that doing so would tie the legislation to a president unpopular in their red rural districts. They did the same thing in 1993 and 1994 when the Clinton administration sought to universalize health insurance. Back then, Republicans demonized the Health Security Act and labeled it “Hillarycare"" — and it went down the tubes, along with the first lady’s standing in the polls. It really is about branding — and Donald Trump knows that all too well. That’s why he tweets about “the failing New York Times” and “the crooked media” and “fake news.” With every disparaging tweet, he’s inoculating his base against information that reflects poorly on him. He wants them so well vaccinated that he could quite literally stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot someone, have it reported on CNN or MSNBC or in the NYT or the Washington Post, and few of his voters would believe it — precisely because they don’t believe the media. As the Russia affair daily drips out, Trumpists everywhere are lining up to kill the messenger: “I am personally offended by the American news media. I think it is destructive and disgusting. It is a danger to the country right now.” That from former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich. Since it’s about branding and since Trump’s and his sycophants’ war on our liberties will not abate as long as Trump sits in the Oval Office autographing GOP legislation, we need to use every peaceful means we have to resist. One thing we can do right away is to stop using the word “media.” It’s too easy to hate the media. It’s too easy to mistrust the media. It’s too easy to criticize the media. It’s too easy to oppose the media. It’s much harder to hate, to mistrust, to criticize, and to oppose the free press. Asking “Do you support a free press?” will elicit a much different response than asking “Do you support the media?” Asking Donald Trump why he hates the free press is a tougher question for him to answer than inquiring about why he hates the media. So media, the word, must go — replaced by free press. Americans who believe in journalism, Americans who believe in the First Amendment, Americans who believe that the fourth estate is crucial to our democracy, and Americans who wish to guard against the excesses of the Trump administration, need to delete the word “media” from their vocabulary and in its place consistently use the nomenclature free press. President Trump won’t stop tweeting that the media is “failing” and “crooked” and “fake news.” We, therefore, must not stop talking about the indispensable role a free press plays in the lives of a free people living in a democracy that is currently under great stress. —Rodney Wilson teaches political science at a community college in Missouri.

51,PARENTS,What Parents Can Learn From Teen Vogue's Sex Advice Controversy,"Stephanie Loomis Pappas, ContributorWriter at Snackdinner",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/be-a-trusted-source-but-not-the-only-source-what_us_596a54f4e4b022bb9372b210,"Be a trusted source, but not the only source.",2017-07-15,<p>Your kid's metaphorical backpack should be full of trusted sources. </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/596a55302100001700fc7099.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This post is not about anal sex. It’s not about any sex position, or any position about sex. It’s not about what’s “appropriate” or “inappropriate” content for teen magazines. It’s not about being sex positive, or sex negative, nor is it about being for or against sex education.It’s about sources.On July 7, Teen Vogue published “Anal Sex: What You Need to Know.” Gigi Engle opens the piece with direct and practical advice: “When it comes to your body, it’s important that you have the facts. Being in the dark is not doing your sexual health or self-understanding any favors.”That’s great advice, not just for teens considering a particular sex act but for all people approaching any new topic.There are some wildly incorrect assumptions about the article flying around, so here’s a quick run-down. Engle devotes the first seven paragraphs just talking about sex education more broadly: why Googling for sex advice may lead you astray, how not all types of sex feel right to everyone, how it’s helpful for everyone to be more informed. But there’s no pressure to have anal sex or even read about it. Engle advises readers to “click out” if they aren’t comfortable. The rest of the article addresses why anal may feel good, why it might not, how to approach a partner about it, and how to pace yourself. A reasonable and respectful primer for curious readers.Huge props to Teen Vogue here, and to their last year of work more generally. They truly are, as I’ve referred to them elsewhere, “our surprising moral compass during America’s aggressively orange spectacles.”Its readers want well-researched, politically engaged content, and it is delivering. So huge props also go to those readers, who are far more sophisticated than my teenage, Cosmo-reading self.What’s much more interesting than the article is the responses it has drawn from the mommy blogs. Predictably, there are conservative parents who think it’s never appropriate to talk about sex to teenagers. Perhaps as predictably, there are liberal voices angry at the article for defining women’s sexual experiences in relation to men. There’s a range of positions in between, from disagreement about age-appropriate conversations about sex, to informing parents what their kids might be reading.I would link these responses for you, but I can’t, because many of these bloggers have found their social media accounts de-activated for sharing “child pornography.”Yup.Ugh.I’ll trust readers to trust my direction and not report me here, because I want to get to the most baffling response the article has received: that kids shouldn’t be reading about sex in Teen Vogue because their parents should be the ones to teach them.That is insane.To see this insanity, we have to put a plug in the whole anal sex question ― the whole of sex ed, even ― and think about our children’s education.You find your kid has been watching “Sesame Street” and now knows how to count to 10. Or he read a cookbook and now understands how to make pesto. Are you enraged at The Count or Jamie Oliver for teaching your child these things? Are you angry you didn’t get to teach your kid these things yourself?I like math. I love pesto. But I lose nothing when my son learns about these things from other sources. I can build on what he’s learned, teaching him “11” or swapping his pine nuts for pistachios.These examples are intentionally simple. There aren’t weighty moral or ethical debates about numbers or basil. But I would argue that, as our children’s learning opportunities get more complex, it’s even more important for them to seek more sources of knowledge.Let’s zoom way past counting and cooking, past early sex ed, and into the decisions we make as parents, like choosing a pediatrician. You may have sought your parents’ advice in making that decision, but you probably also used a variety of additional sources. You may have read a parenting book with questionnaires for your top choices. You may have read patient reviews, or sought opinions from trusted friends with older kids. You may have used information from your insurance company or medical provider. And all of that research was just for choosing a doctor. If your child had an illness, you probably sought out even more sources of information.Your own decisions are improved by seeking information from others. So why would you want to be your kid’s only source of information about any topic?Maybe my open attitude toward information-searching will change as my own child turns from 3 to 13. But I like that he learns from more sources than me. I like that he notices contradictory beliefs (his dad believes steak to be delicious, while I believe it to be disgusting). I like that he has to grapple with contradictory information and sort things out for himself.The Teen Vogue controversy has got me thinking I need to focus even more on not being the only data source around, so that when we move on from counting and chopping, I will be prepared to be just one more (hopefully trusted) source among many.—This post originally appeared at snackdinner, where we believe that better researchers make better parents.

52,POLITICS,How 2 Republicans Ended Up At Odds With Their Party On Health Care,Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senate-republicans-health-care_us_5968efbee4b017418627172e,Sens. Susan Collins and Rand Paul keep rejecting Obamacare repeal bills -- for very different reasons.,2017-07-15,Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) is mobbed by reporters who know she's not a fan of her party's Obamacare repeal bills.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5968f36d2100003400fc6eb5.jpeg?ops=crop_89_0_4779_3456%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Senate Republican leaders can’t seem to find the votes to repeal and replace Obamacare. They’ve had no help from Democrats, of course, who oppose what they’re doing and haven’t been consulted anyway. But they’ve also had no help from two senators in their own party: Susan Collins of Maine and Rand Paul of Kentucky.Collins and Paul have been a hard no on both of the GOP health care bills unveiled over the last month. That’s made things exceptionally difficult for Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who can afford to lose only two Republican votes. It’s left his latest Obamacare repeal bill hanging by a thread, as a handful of Republicans on the fence threaten to produce the fatal third vote.They’re an unlikely pair to ended up united against their party on something. Collins is a pro-abortion rights moderate from a state that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton carried in 2016; Paul is a libertarian-leaning conservative who regularly rails against big government. But their different ideologies explain why they are so opposed to what GOP leaders are doing.The thrust of Collins’ concern is that Republicans are trying to repeal too much of the Affordable Care Act, to the point where people will get hurt. The GOP’s latest bill, which was released Thursday, would cut overall Medicaid funding by more than 30 percent and eliminate the Affordable Care Act’s expansion of that program. That would mean millions fewer people would have access to Medicaid, namely low-income and elderly people.Collins wasted little time announcing her opposition to the bill and instead urged her colleagues to change course and work on a bipartisan fix to Obamacare.Collins also has problems with the sheer number of people who would lose health care coverage under the bill and the plan’s negative effect on health care access in rural areas.The Congressional Budget Office hasn’t yet released its estimates on the revision of the health care bill, but under the original Senate version, which isn’t that different from the new one, roughly 22 million people would lose coverage.Paul, meanwhile, argues that the GOP health care bills wouldn’t repeal enough of the Affordable Care Act. He’s complained all year about Republicans leaving too much of the law intact, and, when GOP leaders unveiled their initial health care bill in June, he ripped it as too expensive and doomed to fail.“The bill is just being lit up like a Christmas tree full of billion-dollar ornaments, and it’s not repeal,” Paul fumed in a Fox News Sunday interview earlier this month.“Now the Republicans are getting so weak-kneed they’re saying, ‘Oh, we’re afraid to repeal the taxes,’” he continued. “What happened to these people? They all were for repealing Obamacare. Now there’s virtually no one left.”The Kentucky senator is even less happy with the revised health care bill, which includes new insurance deregulation provisions. The language was added to win support from conservatives, but it comes with more federal spending ― a big no-no for Paul, who fundamentally disagrees with the idea of the government subsidizing health care.He aired his grievances in a Thursday op-ed in The Washington Times, headlined “Crony Capitalism Isn’t a Right, So Why Does Senate Healthcare Bill Give Insurance Companies the Right to a Bailout?”“I really can’t describe my level of disappointment,” Paul wrote. “Crony capitalism is enshrined as a ‘right’ by the new GOP Obamacare bill, while that bill does little to nothing to repeal Obamacare or fix our ailing healthcare sector.”"

As a child with a disability, my Medicaid helped me get the medical procedures I needed to have a chance to walk and live more independently. During those times when I was younger, there was no other way my young mother would’ve even been able to afford the surgeries and therapy that ensued for years without the assistance Medicaid provided to us. Thankfully, we encountered wonderful doctors along the way. They helped me gain the ability to walk with the use of a cane for just a bit of help. Trust me, for someone whose prognosis was that they would never walk at all, that is a great feat to say the least. Recently, I heard someone say that people who are on Medicaid are just lazy. This is something that based on personal experiences is the farthest thing from the truth. Don’t get me wrong, that’s not to say there isn’t a bad apple or two in the bunch, but honestly to make that blanket statement about so many beneficiaries is a bit of an unfair generalization. I remember my grandmother taking me to appointments while my mom tried to work as much as she could to provide for me. As I got older and into high school, she worked two jobs just to make sure we were okay.When I got to college, it was thanks to my Medicaid that I could even go, and think about options that might lead to actual work experience. The fact that I was subsequently able to work at the campus legal services office gave me an edge as far as being more marketable to potential employers. The experience was truly invaluable to me. Although a well-known fact in the disability community, people outside of the community sometimes aren’t aware that people with disabilities face higher unemployment rates than their non-disabled counterparts. Another misconception under the veil of secrecy is that having access to the services that Medicaid provides allows us the opportunity to work and live in our communities alongside our family and friends.After graduating and getting a full-time job, I could still receive the medical services I needed. Some people don’t realize that even when you work, you’re able to access Medicaid under certain circumstances. I would have to say that looking back on that time, I’m very grateful for being able to use the services. I could get medical transportation at a discounted rate with the local paratransit service. This is a great help to someone who worked but still lived on a limited amount of resources at the same time. It certainly helped make the cost of my healthcare a bit less financially taxing to me.Now, as a widow and a mother to a 5-year-old boy, my gratitude for the availability of Medicaid continues. My son can access the routine services that allow him to be a thriving little boy. At the same time, I am currently living with the very real concern of what the proposed Medicaid cuts will do to the overall well-being of my family. This is also a growing concern for others around the country who rely on the services Medicaid provides them. It is essential for them to access the independence Medicaid allows them to have so they can fully participate in society just like everyone else."

When the now 22-year-old was just a sophomore business major at Georgetown University in 2013, she quit school to work on her software business full time after it got funding. Cho was, of course, following in the footsteps of iconic founders Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, who all famously ditched university life.The gambit paid off. Last year Cho’s company was acquired by a large tech firm called Meltwater, where she now works as a product design lead in San Francisco.Almost a year after settling into the job, Cho read an essay that went off like a bomb in the tech world. Susan Fowler, a former Uber engineer, detailed the mistreatment and harassment she experienced at the ride-hailing company ― and how her complaints went ignored. Everyone read it, including Cho and her colleague at Meltwater, Grace Choi. They saw themselves in that post. They started talking, opening up about their very personal experiences with discrimination, harassment and racism in the work world. “There were stories we hadn’t shared with anyone else,” Cho said.In very typical Silicon Valley fashion, the conversation made them wonder, “Why don’t good solutions to sexual harassment already exist?” Choi writes in a post on Medium. They set out to find one, or at least figure out a way to help with the problem.And finally, this week Cho, Choi and Annie Shin, a software engineer who had been friends with Cho since high school, launched Betterbrave.com, a comprehensive guide for anyone who’s experienced sexual harassment at work and doesn’t know what to do next.The three women devoted hours of their free time over the past several months to put together the site, reaching out to hundreds of people to talk about sexual harassment, including employment lawyers, human resources professionals, and women in their network who spoke about confronting tricky workplace situations.“It felt like our duty to figure out a way to address this issue,” said Cho. The website features information on what constitutes harassment ― including unwelcome sexual advances, inappropriate touching, jokes and gestures, as well as guidance on what to do if it’s happening to you.In clear, straightforward language, the site offers guidance for those wondering how to handle mistreatment at work. There’s also a form you can fill out to be connected with an experienced attorney who can offer guidance. Many will offer a free consultation for those who’ve been targets of sexual harassment.In a section called My Options, the site says victims should let harassers know their behavior made them feel uncomfortable. “Be firm, specific, and suggest a behavior that is more appropriate,” the site advises. “Never apologize. It might look something like this — ‘Hey Josh, your remarks about my outfits on a daily basis make me uncomfortable. I’d prefer if you would stop making these comments.’”A section called My Rights is firm: “There are laws against sexual harassment,” reads the site. “Repeat that back to us. There are laws against sexual harassment. Moreover, there are laws against retaliating for reporting sexual harassment.”Cho and the site emphasize that if you believe you’ve been sexually harassed you should contact a lawyer. Though targets certainly can talk to their employers’ human resources department, that’s not always helpful. “We heard a lot of stories where HR mishandled the case,” Cho said. In Fowler’s case, Uber’s HR department sided with her harasser.A California employment lawyer, Devin Coyle, helped fact-check the site. Another lawyer with expertise in sexual harassment told HuffPost that the site looked pretty good but also emphasized the importance for victims of harassment to consult with a lawyer to best understand their options.Cho and her co-founders aren’t making any money off Betterbrave.com for now. Lawyers who get new clients through the website could potentially make money from new cases, of course.Cho’s not ruling out profits down the line. “We’ll see how things go,” she said, explaining they want to do a lot more research before committing to a for-profit model. “We want to ensure that whichever model we choose aligns with our mission.”Next up for the site is a guide for “allies,” people who know, or want to help, targets of harassment.Not enough people understand that this problem even exists, so one clear goal is education, Cho said. And the issue for her and her co-founders feels personal. A lot of the time, young women who are new to the workforce are even more vulnerable to unwelcome sexual advances, she noted.“You’re young and you have your entire career ahead of you. It’s terrifying,” she said. Still, she adds, this happens to women (and men) at every age. “It’s just kind of everywhere.”Cho said the site’s been getting a steady flow of traffic since it launched. On Tuesday, Betterbrave got a thumbs-up from the woman who inspired the whole endeavor. A tweet from Susan Fowler read, “This is AMAZING!”"

The award is given out every four years. Mirzakhani was the first woman and first Iranian to receive the honor since its creation in 1936. Born in Tehran, Mirzakhani came to the U.S. to attend graduate school at Harvard University. At the time, she had become the first girl named on Iran’s team in the International Mathematical Olympiad and had already won gold medals in the 1990s, NPR reported.Mirzakhani fought breast cancer for the last four years of her life, which eventually spread to her bone marrow. She died in the U.S.Iranian-American scientist Firouz Naderi shared his grief on Instagram. “A light was turned off today,” he said in a post. “It breaks my heart.”“A genius? Yes,” Naderi said in another post.” But also a daughter, a mother and a wife.”In 2008, Mirzakhani joined the faculty of Stanford University, where she served as a professor of mathematics until her death.“Maryam is gone far too soon, but her impact will live on for the thousands of women she inspired to pursue math and science,” Stanford President Marc Tessier-Lavigne said in a statement published Saturday. “Maryam was a brilliant mathematical theorist, and also a humble person who accepted honors only with the hope that it might encourage others to follow her path. Her contributions as both a scholar and a role model are significant and enduring, and she will be dearly missed here at Stanford and around the world.”Mirzakhani said mathematics made her feel like a detective. “It is fun — it’s like solving a puzzle or connecting the dots in a detective case,” Mirzakhani said after winning the Fields Medal, according to NPR. “I felt that this was something I could do, and I wanted to pursue this path.”"

She was one of the principal forces behind “Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” after which she co-created “Point Pleasant” and wrote episodes of “Grey’s Anatomy,” “Private Practice,” “Mad Men” and “Glee.” Her latest creations include “UnREAL,” “Girlfriends’ Guide to Divorce,” the forthcoming HBO adaptation of Gillian Flynn’s “Sharp Objects” and the new Netflix movie “To the Bone,” which premiered July 14.“To the Bone” is a personal project for the 52-year-old Noxon, who channeled her own struggles with anorexia to tell the story of a sardonic 20-something (Lily Collins) whose uptight stepmother (Carrie Preston) encourages her to move into a home for young adults with eating disorders. There, she works with a frank doctor (Keanu Reeves) who employs radical therapy strategies, and she meets an artistic love interest (Alex Sharp) with a penchant for grand gestures.After male studio executives showed little interest in the movie, Noxon found the backing of female producers. Following its well-received Sundance premiere in January, “To the Bone” sold to Netflix for a steep $8 million. We hopped on the phone with Noxon last week to discuss the film and her career.Given your own experiences with anorexia, what did you hope to convey with this movie?Any time you make a movie about a disorder of any kind, it has the potential to be all one thing, or to be maudlin. I really hoped with this project that we’d have variation and we’d really show a person who also happens to have a disorder, not a movie about a disease.After years of working in television, this is your directorial debut. Did you ever imagine it as a series instead?I never did think of it as a TV show because it was so personal to me. I had gone through it. It felt to me like a story that wanted to have a beginning, a middle and an end. It’s a difficult topic; it’s not necessarily one that you want to live in forever. Other than the scripts you were hired to write, like “Fright Night” and “I Am Number Four,” have you tried to get your own moves off the ground before? I had another feature that I wrote — I’ve always joked that I had one project for them and one for me. The one for me is something that I write just for myself. With the same producer, Julie Lynn, I had developed a script that I wrote just for me. We actually attached Susan Sarandon to star in it, but it just never got off the ground. So when I wrote this and brought it to Julie and asked her if she thought it was a movie, she wrote me back an email — she also produced the movie “Wit,” and she said she thought it was not unlike it in its DNA, and she felt really strongly that we needed to make it. It very much comes from an authentic place that I care about.Maybe you don’t trace the through-lines in your work this explicitly, but a lot of your stories deal with characters battling monsters, literal and figurative: the vampires in “Buffy,” the bullying and manipulation in “UnREAL,” divorce in “Girlfriends’ Guide to Divorce,” and now anorexia in “To the Bone.”I absolutely think one thing I learned from [“Buffy” creator Joss Whedon] early on was that leaning into genre conventions to tell harder stories is a great way to Trojan-horse-in other content. For me, “Girlfriends’ Guide” was a romantic comedy, but we brought in a lot of content about sexual politics, feminist issues and lots of things that are really important to me, but in a pretty package. It’s issues with really nice heels. And with this one, I think the YA genre became a really great container for me because I felt it was dealing with issues that were character-driven and there was room for humor there and a little bit of romance. I invented this character who was at the home with Lily’s character, and they have a kind of odd romance. By bringing in a few more conventional things, I was able to tell a pretty challenging story. So I’m absolutely still using the lessons I learned on “Buffy” — it’s just that as I’m getting a little older and honing in on my voice, I don’t need the monster costume.You created a character who is wry and clipped, and the tone of “To the Bone” is often relatively light. Did you start with a heavier script and then mine for humor?No, I think that is the way I have learned to write. My first draft of this was not that far from what we ended up shooting. I’ve been thinking about it for a long time, and obviously there were some rewrites, but a lot of it is what you see. Because some it actually happened to me, it was the greatest chance to go back into my past and say, “If I had been really cool or known the right thing to say, I would have done that.” Lily got to play the cooler, quicker version of me when I was that age. The humor was a goal, and I wanted to bring it in at the beginning. The very first scene in the recovery home where she shows her collage, I wanted to immediately disarm people about what their expectations were going to be.  Having written for “Buffy” since Season 2 and then been the showrunner during its sixth and seventh seasons, how did you feel about the glowing attention it got this year for its 20th anniversary?I’ll be honest: I had a real deep-seated fear that “Buffy” was going to be my peak. It was such a beautiful experience. It was such a fully realized show. I had such a great relationship with Joss. There were so many things that felt once-in-a-lifetime, and I kind of thought, “This is my first job and it may be my last job.” It was twofold, me being so grateful that it still resonates with people. In this day and age, shows can live in perpetuity. But on the other hand I was really moved because it was a beginning for me, not an end. I’m still using the lessons I learned on that show to this day. I’ve grown and changed, and I’m still making television and movies that I feel really proud of. I felt like, wow, 20 years is a short time — it went by really fast. I’m also amazed to see that so many of the writers and creative people involved with that show have gone on to do really remarkable work. It was touching and very moving. Now that you’re creating your own shows and directing movies, are you less inclined to write for other people’s shows, the way you did with “Private Practice,” “Mad Men” and “Glee”?Gosh, it’s funny that you ask that because there are certain shows that I would love to try my hand at. Like what?Like everbody, I’m addicted to “The Handmaid’s Tale.” But I also love “Kimmy Schmidt” — I’m addicted to that. There are certain shows or people that I would love to work with. One of the greatest things about our business is that if you get to fan out on people you might actually get to meet. “Silicon Valley” is another show that I love. Kumail Nanjiani and I are sort of on the circuit at the same time with sick-people movies. [Editor’s note: Nanjiani co-wrote and stars in “The Big Sick,” which opens in wide release this weekend.] I reached out to him, and we’ve chatted back and forth. He’s one of my favorite actors and comedians around, so I’d love to just work with certain people. This was one of the first times I got to make something where the final decision about what went in or what didn’t go in was up to me. There were notes and there was feedback, but ultimately it was my decision. You live for that, and as scary as that was, it was pretty incredible. It’s hard to want to go back to working by committee.“To the Bone” is now streaming on Netflix. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity."
59,POLITICS,Head Of Trump Voter Fraud Probe Wanted To Change Law To Make Registering More Difficult,Sam Levine,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kris-kobach-nvra_us_59698037e4b017418627ac98,"Kris Kobach sought to make it acceptable to impose a proof-of-citizenship requirement, according to newly public emails.",2017-07-15,"In a Nov. 9 email to the Trump transition team, Kris Kobach explained he had already begun work on an amendment to the 1993 National Voter Registration Act.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/596a268b1a00003400dbee3e.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R), the official leading President Donald Trump’s voter fraud probe, apparently sought to amend federal voting law to make it possible to require proof of citizenship during the voter registration process, according to an email made public Friday as part of an ongoing lawsuit with the American Civil Liberties Union.The email offers the firmest evidence yet that Kobach was interested in amending the 1993 National Voter Registration Act, as has been speculated. The NVRA ― a law championed by voting advocates ― requires motor vehicle, public assistance and some other state agencies to provide voter registration opportunities, and outlines the procedure by which voters can be removed from the rolls.On Nov. 9, the day after Trump was elected president, Gene Hamilton, a member of Trump’s presidential transition team, emailed Kobach with what he called “Day One immigration policy action items.” Kobach responded by saying he had already begun work on proposed legislation targeting the NVRA.“We will... be putting together information on legislation drafts for submission to Congress early in the administration,” Kobach told Hamilton in an email. “I have some already started regarding amendments to the NVRA to make clear that proof of citizenship requirements are permitted (based on my ongoing litigation with the ACLU over this).”In a July 7 email to the ACLU also filed as part of court documents, Garrett Roe, Kobach’s attorney, noted the November email only referred to the possibility of a draft NVRA amendment and that the draft was never sent. The email lends fuel to accusations by critics that Kobach and the Trump administration could be using the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, of which Kobach is the vice chair and de facto leader, as a pretext for changing the NVRA with the aim of making it more difficult for Americans to vote.Kobach did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this article.In 2011, Kansas passed a law requiring voters to show proof of citizenship when they registered to vote. The ACLU sued Kobach over the law, saying it violated the NVRA, and federal courts stepped in last year to block it. A ruling by the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in October forced Kansas to register more than 20,000 voters.On June 28 of this year, the same day Kobach sent a letter to all 50 states requesting publicly available voter data, the Department of Justice sent a letter to the 44 states covered by the NVRA, asking them to detail their compliance with the voter-purging procedures outlined in the law. Voting advocates said the DOJ letter was deeply alarming, with some interpreting it as a signal that the department is gearing up to sue states to kick people off the voting rolls.The November email is the first piece of evidence of Kobach’s intent to amend the NVRA ― something that critics have suspected since Kobach was photographed last November holding documents that listed potential alterations to the law. Kobach initially refused to turn over those documents to the ACLU in the lawsuit over Kansas’ proof-of-citizenship law, only doing so once a judge forced him to. The judge also sanctioned him with a $1,000 fine for making “patently misleading representations” about the documents to the court.Kobach marked the documents as confidential, but the ACLU filed a motion in court Friday to have them unsealed.Kobach, who was an immigration policy adviser during Trump’s White House transition, has been the focus of national attention as the work of the voter fraud panel begins. Election officials in nearly every state have either refused or said they cannot fully comply with Kobach’s request for publicly available voter data.The panel’s first meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, July 19.

Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/energy-transfer-ohio-rover_us_59693390e4b03389bb1768b1,Newly released documents related to its Rover pipeline give weight to critics who call Energy Transfer Partners a “wolf in sheep’s clothing.”,2017-07-15,"A screenshot of an email between Art Arnold, Energy Transfer Partners' lobbyist in Ohio, and Laura Factor, the assistant director at the Ohio EPA.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59693fa91500002000bfda57.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For Energy Transfer Partners, the Texas-based company behind the Dakota Access Pipeline, Feb. 23 was a good day. After months of waging a public and at times bloody battle with protesters bivouacked outside its construction site in North Dakota, law enforcement officers razed the encampment and arrested the holdouts. Meanwhile, roughly 1,700 miles east, the company completed the final edits requested by regulators to its application to start building the Rover natural gas pipeline, a $4.2 billion project through Ohio. That project had sailed through the permitting process, and these markups would be its last. Project manager Buffy Thomason wanted to extend thanks to the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, so she emailed the firm’s lobbyist in the state, Art Arnold, that evening. “It’s awesome,” she wrote in an email, which was obtained by HuffPost. “It’s such a beautiful thing. Please tell your contact how much we appreciate their help.” Arnold forwarded the message to Laura Factor, the agency’s assistant director, less than an hour later. In the same email, Arnold called the OEPA staff “among if not the most honest and helpful people I’ve encountered.” (OEPA Director Craig Butler described Arnold and Factor as “good friends” in a separate exchange with an agency colleague.)“They’ve done their jobs without beating us up in the process,” Arnold added. “They’ve offered options when we were stuck. They’ve pointed us in the right direction so we could build the pipeline and stay within their good graces.”The emails, released this week to Greenpeace through a Freedom of Information Act request, depict a $22 billion firm ― which until recently boasted President Donald Trump as a shareholder and Energy Secretary Rick Perry as a board member ― comfortably exerting influence over a state agency charged with policing its activities. But just a few months after those emails were sent, Energy Transfer Partners and the state officials became embroiled in a vicious public fight over a massive drilling fluid spill and construction pollution. The company has flagrantly challenged the OEPA’s authority, infuriating the agency and eliciting a rare public investigation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, the federal agency that regulates interstate electricity and natural gas operations. The dispute offers a cautionary tale in what one critic described as “regulatory capture” of a state agency by a company with deep ties to the Trump administration and a reputation as an environmental pariah unafraid to deploy scorched-earth tactics against its opponents. The moves by Energy Transfer Partners further fuel fears of what’s to come amid proposed steep cuts to the EPA’s budget and a brazen campaign by U.S. Administrator Scott Pruitt to cozy up to fossil fuel interests.Energy Transfer Partners’ problems in Ohio began shortly after construction began on Rover in March. Heavy rains poured as workers built a stretch of the pipeline over flat farmlands, and workers began dumping excess, sediment-laden water onto fields and into streams, according to citations from the OEPA. Then, in April, the company accidentally leaked onto Ohio wetlands more than 2 million gallons of fluid used to lubricate the machines that bore pathways for underground pipes through a process known as horizontal directional drilling. The spill suffocated anything that lived in an area the size of nearly nine football fields under a foot or more of a slurry of nontoxic bentonite clay and water, the agency said. On May 5, the OEPA ordered the company to submit a plan to address future spills, restore the wetlands and apply for stormwater permitting. It also fined the firm $431,000. In a sharp break from the charm it applied during the application process, Energy Transfer Partners rejected the agency’s demands, insisting that because the pipeline crossed state boundaries, the OEPA lacked the authority to make those orders.Butler, director of OEPA, told HuffPost that this sort of defiant response from a company was unusual. “This kind of pushback we’re getting from Rover that says, ‘You have absolutely no state authority, this is all a FERC issue,’ and the tenor and tone they’ve taken to interact with us doesn’t happen often,” Butler said. “This very negative response that we’ve gotten from Rover up until now and very recently is pretty uncharacteristic.” On May 10, FERC stepped in to back up the state EPA, halting construction at eight sites where Energy Transfer Partners had yet to begin boring the pipe. FERC’s order has given environmental groups like the Sierra Club temporary reprieve from their own legal effort to block a pipeline they see as fueling climate change and endangering the environment in the state; one of the proposed construction sites includes the Captina Creek, the only cold-water stream in Ohio with the right conditions for the endangered hellbender salamander to breed. But FERC allowed Energy Transfer Partners to continue work at the 22 other locations, including the site of the largest spill. The company sent teams to vacuum up the drilling sludge from the wetlands and deposit it in two nearby quarries.Things took another turn on May 26, when the OEPA discovered traces of diesel in the samples collected from the spill site. Using diesel in the drilling fluids violated the permit FERC had granted, forcing regulators to reclassify the site as an industrial accident. On June 1, FERC opened an investigation into the incident. On July 7, the OEPA once again sent a letter listing demands to Energy Transfer Partners. The letter reiterated orders made about two months earlier to apply for stormwater permits, pay mounting fines nearing $1 million and submit a plan to restore the wetlands. The agency also directed the company to excavate the diesel-contaminated slurry from the quarries, dispose of it at solid-waste landfills and install groundwater monitoring around the area to ensure that private wells weren’t affected. The company agreed only after FERC backed up the OEPA on the demands five days later. The OEPA said it will review Energy Transfer Partners’ submissions by next week to determine if its plans are in compliance.In a brief phone interview, Energy Transfer Partners spokeswoman Alexis Daniel told HuffPost the company plans to meet regulators’ demands, but declined to comment further.  “We do continue to work with the Ohio EPA to comply with their directives,” Daniel said. “We’re working through that process with them and FERC on a daily, hourly basis.”The OEPA said it remains committed to supporting oil and gas development in the state. Still, Butler, the agency’s director, said Energy Transfer Partners “received no preferential treatment” during the application process, despite what seemed like an amicable relationship at the start of the construction process. “At the highest level, this does not diminish our overall posture in terms of trying to support oil and gas development in the state, including the development of pipeline networks,” he said. “We’ve got several of these large pipelines. Our only concern is, while we’re supporting they at least have to follow the rules.”He added pointedly: “Rover clearly isn’t.” "

They are training to clear landmines, and Segura is the only woman in sight.In fact, as we drive around the Colombian army base – a sprawling complex in the “tierra caliente,” or hot country, three hours outside of Bogota – she is the only woman in uniform anywhere.For decades, Colombia’s female army recruits were relegated to back-office positions. That changed in 2009, when a new policy allowed women to serve. Since then, women like Segura have been able to rise up the ranks. While they are trained for battle, they have not yet been deployed to combat positions.Segura, 23, joined in the first wave of female recruitment. Eight years later, she is helping to train the next generation of demining specialists, who will help clear Colombia’s soil of the deadly remains of a 50-year civil conflict that is only just coming to an end.Last year, the government agreed to a peace deal with the country’s left-wing FARC guerrilla group (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia). More than 7,000 fighters have demobilized since the agreement, but clearing the detritus of the war is going to take much longer. Colombia’s president, Juan Manuel Santos, has promised that the country will be free of landmines by 2021.On this day, a torrential downpour has cleared for bright blue skies. The humidity is such that it feels like steam is rising off the grass. In one of the fields, some former recruits are being tested to check they are still up to standard.It takes immense patience to work in demining: There are several stages to clearing a vegetable-patch-sized clearing. First, the soldiers search for cables or wires, triggers that might have been left above ground. Then, they start to clear the foliage, cutting and collecting tiny blades of grass so they don’t set off an explosive device below. Then the land is checked with a metal detector, or with dogs if the deminers suspect a chemical IED might have been left there.If they get a positive reading, the dig begins. In a week, the deminers might find nothing, or they might come across four or five homemade explosives in one day.It is slow, painstaking work, taking a whole day to clear a patch 3–6ft (1–2m) square – and that’s working 7 a.m. to 6 p.m., often in scorching temperatures.The task they are facing is gargantuan: Almost every region in the country is thought to be plagued with IEDs and handmade explosives. National statistics show there have been 11,486 victims since 1990, and this year 15 people have been killed or injured by landmines, five of them children.To deal with the challenge, the army has expanded from one demining battalion to seven, and drafted in soldiers, like Segura, to help train the troops. They have found that local communities, which have seen decades of conflict between the government and the FARC rebels, open up more easily to women, trust them more, and give them better information on where the community believes the mines might be laid.“It’s not always easy to get good information from these communities – these are often people who don’t trust the army,” says Segura, who has swapped her green combat clothes for the navy blue of the humanitarian demining brigade. “Previously, talking about where the mines were would have meant risking their lives.”Segura grew up in Villavicencio, a frontier town in a region plagued by violence between the army, guerrilla fighters and organized crime groups. As a child, she says she often saw people who had been injured by landmines – they had lost their legs or their hands, or both.Villavicencio is in Meta, the most contaminated area in the country, with almost 2,000 acres (8 million square meters) of land affected, government figures show. Rumor has it that during the worst years, locals there would send livestock through the fields ahead of them because from one day to the next the path might have been mined. If it had been, they lost their herd, but at least they came out alive.“It is thought that anti-personnel mines have been planted in 30 departments – that’s practically 98 percent of Colombia,” Segura says. “That affects communities on a socioeconomic level, with people who can’t use all their land to farm, and so it has a big impact in these rural zones where people live off the land.“It affects paths to schools and access to water holes. But there is also a psychological impact, and that is what we are trying to combat by generating confidence in the job we are doing.”There are currently eight women in Colombia’s demining brigade, all of them certified project leaders. They, too, have gone through months of vigorous training and in-the-field experience so that they become experts on the process – and so that they can recognize the psychological impact this kind of job can have on the recruits.“This work,” Segura explains, “it’s hard. The soldiers have to be motivated, well-behaved and physically fit to work eight hours a day, six days a week. Most important is that they are emotionally stable – you need to be able to confront an invisible enemy that can strike at any moment. Even the best-trained person can be scared. There’s always a risk, but you can’t let it affect your judgment.”In some of the ranks, Segura says, there is still machismo, but most people are now concentrating on the job in hand. “It’s your work, not your gender, that matters,” she says.“This is a big change,” says Segura. “But the army fought so that this could happen. Now we are working to make Colombia free of mines. This is a step so that people can go back to the lands they were displaced from.”This article originally appeared on Women & Girls Hub.

Its kick-off exhibit offers insights into Inuit communities from the Kitikmeot region of Nunavut.CAMBRIDGE BAY, A Canadian Arctic community of about 1,800 people perched on the shores of Victoria Island along the Northwest Passage, is in many respects a world away from the nation’s capital of Ottawa, which lies just over 3,000km (nearly 2,000 miles) south. But when a group of Cambridge Bay residents recently visited the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa they had at times the sense that they were back home.That’s because the museum is hosting, as part of its new Canada Goose Arctic Gallery, an exhibit that showcases the Canadian Central Arctic region’s distinctive Inuinnait, or Copper Inuit, culture, as well as contemporary efforts to preserve local traditions and language.You won’t find soapstone carvings or printmaking – the best-recognized and most commercially successful examples of Inuit art. Nor does the exhibit dwell exclusively on the long-ago past. Instead, said exhibit’s curator Brendan Griebel, “What we really tried to show are what ordinary people are doing or making while thinking about the past, and how they’re building culture into their lives in these subtle ways, through these little tools and these artifacts they’re still making or using.”Case in point: Alongside a traditional caribou-skin parka, with its distinctive boxy shoulders, is a graduation gown from Nunavut Arctic College with a similar regional design. Visitors also hear elders describe the exhibit in their native language of Inuinnaqtun, thanks to recordings played on headsets, while a video screen shows elders demonstrating different techniques of skinning animals, preparing hides and sewing.“We want to pass down our culture through our language for generations to come, so we’re still thriving as who we are as a people,” said Pamela Gross, the executive director of the Kitikmeot Heritage Society.“We tried to show that we still use our culture, but sometimes have a modern twist on the objects we use today by using materials like dyed seal skin, or manufactured tanned seal skins or furs that ultimately last longer, or modern materials such as calico that we can buy at the store,” she added.Inuinnait had little contact with people of European heritage before the arrival of the Canadian Arctic Expedition, which explored the region between 1913 and 1916. All of the historic artifacts displayed at the exhibit were collected during that expedition by Diamond Jenness, who went on to become a renowned anthropologist who wrote extensively about Inuit traditions.“It was a really interesting part of Inuinnait history, because it was the last Inuit group to be contacted by the outside world,” said Griebel. “So when this Canadian Arctic Expedition showed up around 1914, they were literally meeting with this group, many of whom had never met the outside world, and they were reliant on the land. There’s a little bit of metal filtering in by trade at this point. So this collection represents this last glimpse of the culture purely unmediated by Western materials or lifestyles. It’s such an important touchstone.”The artifacts, on loan from Canada’s Museum of History, have in recent years inspired community elders to try to revive nearly forgotten traditions. Griebel has worked with the Kitikmeot Heritage Society for the past decade on these efforts.One of the more eye-catching items on display is a hat made from ermine fur, with the head of a loon poking out of the top with its bill standing upright. As an interpretive sign at the exhibit explains, the hat “worn by dancers provided them with the animals’ respective traits of a loud, clear singing voice and fleet-footedness.”“It’s this almost extinct style of freeform dance done by Innunait,” said Griebel. “It’s also called loon dancing, and it’s very well documented by Jenness. We started getting really interested in the style and some of the songs related to it.“None of the elders had any firsthand memories of this any more in Cambridge Bay, so we started going back into the records and the collections and we found one of the dance suits that was used during this dance,” he added. “The elders spent quite a large amount of time reconstructing this thing.” The exhibit includes images of the process, along with a picture of them wearing the original from 100 years ago.Elders also took interest in working with fish skin – a material rarely used by Inuinnait. “It was used in little bits of clothing, you see them in bags a lot – they basically turn a char inside out and use it as a tool bag,” said Griebel.“For some reason fish skin just really resonated with them,” he said. They had no memory of working with the stuff, but they were really interested. We spent a summer creating fish-skin projects … For them, I think it was really interesting to explore new materials and techniques from other parts of the Arctic, and figure it out and apply what they know from their own material culture. I know projects like that are special for the elders, because they do get tired from doing the same things over and over, and they’re put in positions as teachers where they have to do that.”The Kitikmeot Heritage Society originally brought Griebel on board to work on a smaller exhibit for their community’s cultural center. The society later heard that the Museum of Nature was seeking exhibits that highlights Indigenous voices for its new Arctic gallery and successfully bid on the space. “We hope we can teach people about who we are, so there’s more understanding about our culture,” said Gross.While a cultural exhibit is beyond the Canadian Museum of Nature’s usual focus on science, an Arctic gallery would be remiss if it didn’t include the voices of Indigenous people, said Laurel McIvor, a senior content developer with the museum. The museum plans to showcase a new exhibit in the space about every two years.“We acknowledge there’s a huge cultural story, and that’s not part of our natural science mandate,” said McIvor. “The other part is that we wanted to have it fresh; we wanted to have content that’s renewable. And we thought that way we could have different communities tell their stories.”This article originally appeared on Arctic Deeply.

67,POLITICS,Judge Grants Bid To Narrow Trump Travel Ban,"By Dan Levine and Mica Rosenberg, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-travel-ban-ruling-hawaii_us_59685428e4b03389bb164ef9,U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson granted Hawaii’s request to exempt grandparents and other relatives from the ban.,2017-07-14,Hawaii attorney general Douglas Chin had asked for the injunction allowing grandparents and other family members to travel to the U.S.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5968557f1500006303bfd84e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s temporary ban on travelers from six Muslim-majority countries cannot stop grandparents and other relatives of United States citizens from entering the country, a U.S. judge said on Thursday.The ruling by U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Honolulu also opens the door for more refugees and deals Trump a fresh courtroom defeat in a long back-and-forth over an executive order that has gone all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court.Trump’s order is a pretext for illegal discrimination, Hawaii Attorney General Douglas Chin said in a statement.“Family members have been separated and real people have suffered enough,” Chin said.Chin had asked Watson for an injunction allowing grandparents and other family members to travel to the United States. Hawaii and refugee groups also had argued that resettlement agencies have a “bona fide” relationship with the refugees they help, sometimes over the course of years.The Justice Department said its rules were properly grounded in immigration law.Watson said the assurance by a resettlement agency to provide basic services to a newly arrived refugee constitutes an adequate connection to the U.S. because it is a sufficiently formal and documented agreement that triggers responsibilities and compensation.″‘Bona fide’ does not get any more ‘bona fide’ than that,” Watson said.Melanie Nezer, vice president of global refugee advocacy group HIAS, said the ruling should mean that refugees can continue to be resettled in the United States, beyond a cap of 50,000 set by the executive order. That limit was reached this week.“We are thrilled that thousands of people will be reunited with their family members,” said Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project.More than 24,000 additional refugees should be allowed to travel to the U.S. under Watson’s order, she estimated.Watson did not grant everything the state of Hawaii sought, however. He rejected a request to categorically exempt all Iraqis refugee applicants who believe they are at risk due to their work for the U.S. government since March, 2003, as interpreters and translators, for instance.Watson also refused a blanket exemption for those eligible to apply to a refugee program aimed at protecting certain children at risk in El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala.The roll-out of the narrowed version of the ban was more subdued than in January, when Trump first signed a more expansive version of his order. That sparked protests and chaos at airports around the country and the world."
68,WORLD NEWS,German Study Finds Radicalized Muslims Have Little Actual Knowledge Of Islam,Antonia Blumberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/german-study-finds-radicalized-muslims-have-little-actual-knowledge-of-islam_us_5967f362e4b03389bb163c58,"A group of professed Muslim radicals ""had no basic knowledge about Islam,” according to a new study.",2017-07-14,"Researchers analyzed 5,757 WhatsApp messages found on a phone seized by police following a terrorist attack in the spring of 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/596803362100003700fc6d26.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Extremists and Islamophobes alike have attempted to paint violent factions within Islam as the true expression of the faith. But a new study gives credence to what countless Muslim leaders, activists and scholars have argued: that groups like the self-proclaimed Islamic State are Muslim in name alone.A group of German scholars at the Universities of Bielefeld and Osnabrück analyzed 5,757 WhatsApp messages found on a phone seized by police following a terrorist attack in the spring of 2016. The messages were exchanged among 12 young men involved in the attack. The attack itself was not identified in the report. Deutsche Welle noted that the timeframe suggested it may have been a bombing at a Sikh temple in Essen carried out in April of that year by a group of German teens with reported links to Islamic extremism.Researchers conducting the study said the young men’s conversations demonstrated little understanding of their professed faith and that the group constructed a “Lego Islam” to suit their purposes.Bacem Dziri, a researcher at the University of Osnabrück and co-author on the report, examined the messages from an Islamic studies perspective and concluded: “The group had no basic knowledge about Islam.”The scholars published their study as a book exploring the “violent Salafist youth scene in Germany,” according to the Amazon blurb, referencing an ultraconservative strain of Islam with which the young men were allegedly affiliated.The Brookings Institute defines Salafism as “the idea that the most authentic and true Islam is found in the lived example of the early, righteous generations of Muslims, known as the Salaf, who were closest in both time and proximity to the Prophet Muhammad.” The movement has historically been apolitical and nonviolent, wrote researcher Mohammed Alyahya in a column on The New York Times. But Brookings notes that a smaller offshoot faction, called Salafi-jihadists, do promote violence as a “divine imperative” and include groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda.As one case study, the Amazon blurb highlights, the WhatsApp chats offer “insight into the group-internal dynamics of young Salafists” and their “radicalization processes.”One thing that stood out, Dziri said in an email to HuffPost, was the extent to which the men had distanced themselves from local mosques and seemed confused about things as simple as how to go about conducting Friday prayers.At one point in the exchange a young man asked if the faith permits cheating in school, the researcher said. “The answer was, that it is allowed to do everything with the unbelievers. And since nearly all other people are unbelievers, you can do everything with everyone,” Dziri said.Another man admitted in the messages he didn’t have a copy of the Quran, Islam’s holy text. And the others agreed that they needed to purchase one. Dr. Rauf Ceylan, a professor at the University of Osnabrück and one of the study’s co-authors, said it was “striking” that the discussion about obtaining a Quran occurred well after the group had been established. “All religious conversations conducted up to this time were only content that has been learned from hearsay and rumors,” Ceylan told HuffPost.When the group’s self-appointed leader called for a meeting, one participant fretted that he didn’t have any Islamic clothing. The leader responded: “You can also wear sweatpants or something like that. If you want I can loan you something for the day.”The report is just a case study from one group of individuals, and its conclusions might not apply in all circumstances. But it echoes the conclusions of many Muslim scholars and activists who see little resemblance to their religion in such militant groups.Ceylan and Dziri also noted that the 12 men involved in the WhatsApp chat appeared to have received little “religious socialization” and isolated themselves from other Muslims in their community.“One of the main points for us is that these young radicalized people come mostly from a family which is remote from religion and they do not radicalize themselves in mosques,” Dziri said. “With a profound knowledge of faith, it would be impossible, or at least considerably more difficult to radicalize in that way.”"

There is no deservedness in being untoward only to later see the error in your ways.This is a tough sell to the entitled. Those who believe humaneness and love toward our partners is a gift rather than an obligation will inevitably expect praise for finally giving others what they are owed to begin with: respect, adoration, sincerity.In this vein, JAY-Z’s most recent album, “4:44,” and, more specifically, its retroactively released footnotes, are providing listeners — particularly, black men — space to evaluate our own flaws, hurt and occasional ineptitude.JAY-Z’s footnotes are being released weekly on TIDAL, and they offer on-camera ruminations from the artist and a host of notable colleagues on the subjects of his latest tracks. The first footnote released concerned “The Story of O.J.,” a song detailing the ways in which black men come to realize that society will use their blackness as a constraint, regardless of their celebrity. Stars from Will Smith to Chris Rock to Kendrick Lamar appear on grainy tape to chronicle the moments they came into this knowledge.JAY-Z himself theorized the plight of black celebrities:“We tend to, as black people — because we’ve never had anything, which is understandable — we get to a place and we just think we separate ourselves from the culture, you know? Like, O.J. will get to a space where he’s like, ’I’m not black, I’m O.J. Tiger Woods will get to a space where he thinks, ‘I’m above the culture.’ And that same person, when he’s playing golf and playing great, you’re protected. But when you’re not, they gon’ put pictures of you drunk driving and, like, embarrass you. That world will eat you up and spit you out.”But it is the second released footnote, centered about the album’s title track, “4:44,” that delegates more time and space for reflection and cutting self-critique.JAY-Z’s track “4:44” is, perhaps, the most honest and forthright iteration of the rapper listeners have ever heard, with references to his infidelity, his sorrow over inducing the conditions contributing to Beyoncé’s miscarriages, the shame he feels before his children, and the disgrace he heaped upon his family.The ensuing footnotes were a visual catalog of self-admitted grime and sorrow.From JAY-Z:“What I thought when I met my dad was, ‘Oh, I’m free to love now.’ But it’s like, OK, yeah, but how are you gonna do it? You wanna do it — I get it — now how are you gonna do it? You’ve never done this before. No one informed you how to do this. You don’t even have the tools to do it.”From actor Anthony Anderson:“I hear that I’m self-absorbed — that I think it’s always about me — that I’m selfish, controlling, all of the sh*t that we all hear, man.From NBA player Chris Paul:“People see your family.

They don’t think you have to sleep back-to-back.”From rapper Meek Mill:“I had to learn how to treat somebody else as good as I wanted to treat myself ... I grew up in a household, like, the only person you know to treat good is your mom.”From Jesse Williams, whose estrangement from his wife and subsequent relationship with actress Minka Kelly is currently drawing ire: “I was in a relationship for 13 years — 13 real years. Like, not five years, not seven years; 13 years, and all of a sudden motherf**kers are writing think pieces that I somehow threw a 13-year relationship — like, the most painful experience I’ve had in my life with a person I’ve loved with all of my heart — that I threw a person and my family in the trash because a girl I worked with was cute.”Through this lens, the “4:44” footnotes are potent, profound and important.Rarely are black men — to be certain, black people more broadly — afforded the privilege of having our misbehavior indict none but ourselves before the eyes of our nation. Rarely are we granted opportunity to self-criticize in a way that does not damn other black men for our missteps.But an inability to self-criticize, of course, is an untenable condition.It excuses toxic behavior in relationships and leaves a wake of largely black women who love tenderly despite some of us boasting deep character flaws.The greatest accomplishment of JAY-Z’s footnotes, then — and of “4:44” the album — is a subversion of these excuses.Contrary to widespread acclaim, the most mature thing about JAY-Z’s album and its retroactive explainers is not its teachings of financial literacy and its boastful celebrations of excess. Ironically, it’s quite the opposite: it is mature in its rejection of excess ― at least, excess as the sole means to achieve happiness.What we witness in these miniature therapy sessions is the admission of black male mortality in a fashion and space where doing so doesn’t carry the baggage of our nation’s racist stereotypes.It is, simply, black men deliberating their plight and shortcomings freely, openly and without expressing inherent demands for forgiveness.It is black men examining the futility of their manhood before the piercing gaze of lovers they’ve wronged.In previous albums, JAY-Z’s mortality is threatened through physical violence — detractors seeking his head, governments plotting his incarceration, shoddy businessmen hoping to curb his acquisition of things. But he wrestles, in “4:44” and its footnotes, with a different mortality: the realization that even a man with all the worldly possessions he desires is not entitled to the love he seeks if he hasn’t a clue how to nurture it. That he includes other black men, of note and normalcy, in these deep, difficult discussions signals the urgency of these matters and provides space for us to lay bare our trials before the eyes of the world.
