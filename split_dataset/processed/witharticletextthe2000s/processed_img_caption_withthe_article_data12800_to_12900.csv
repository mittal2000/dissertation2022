3,POLITICS,Inside The Trial That Could Determine The Future Of Free Speech In America's Capital,Ryan J. Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/protesting-dc-trump-inauguration-trial_us_5a1e1e84e4b0d724fed48d32,"Trump inauguration demonstrators are facing severe felony charges that critics say threaten to chill future protests in Washington, D.C.",2017-12-10,"A destroyed car window in downtown Washington of a limo that was later set on fire following the inauguration of President Donald Trump on Jan. 20, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a2af4a11e00003b000c2de9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Justice Department prosecutor Jennifer Kerkhoff carried the cardboard evidence box past the jury and placed it next to Officer Andre Reid, the 14-year veteran of the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department seated in the witness stand. Snapping on blue medical gloves inside this downtown courtroom, she took out a JanSport backpack ― the government’s exhibit number 43 ― and began removing its contents: two sharpies, a pencil, a pen, a Florida driver’s license, green goggles, a black bandana, black gloves, sunglasses, an energy drink, a phone charger with a cord, and a black hat.As jurors looked on, Kerkhoff and Reid examined a mask. “Have you ever heard of the term ‘balaclava’?” Kerkhoff asked? Reid hadn’t. He called it a ski mask. They took a look at a plastic bag containing two bandanas soaked in some mysterious “solution” that had a smell to it. “Can you smell that now?” Kerkhoff asked. Reid could.The JanSport in question belongs to Michelle Macchio, a 26-year-old from Naples who hasn’t had possession of the bag or its contents in nearly 11 months, ever since she was caught up in a mass arrest during a protest just before President Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States.Macchio said she was acting as a medic that day. Video shows her with red tape in the shape of a cross on her jacket, and her lawyers say she was carrying a first aid kit. That mysterious foul-smelling solution? Vinegar, which is supposed to dilute the impact of the pepper spray that videos demonstrate police officers shot with abandon that morning.In the past three weeks, as special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election has increasingly jeopardized the Trump presidency’s future, Macchio and her co-defendants are facing down their own. Macchio is one of six individuals currently on trial in the nation’s capital, facing felony charges that could potentially land them in federal prison for decades, or at the very least leave them with felony convictions that would stunt their career prospects and deprive them of certain rights.Another 181 individuals are facing felony trials in the coming year, though the ultimate resolution of a large number of those cases could depend on how this first trial plays out. Twenty other defendants arrested that day have already pleaded guilty, but just one defendant pleaded guilty to a felony. Seven others facing misdemeanors are scheduled for a trial by judge.The charges all stem from a mass arrest conducted by police in downtown D.C. aimed at a group of marchers that included anti-capitalists, anti-fascists and anarchists under the umbrella of an organization called DisruptJ20.Police had kept an eye on what demonstrators had planned that day, sending an undercover officer into a planning meeting where an organizer said their goal was to “make inauguration a giant clusterfuck.” Things quickly got out of control once the group left their gathering point in Logan Circle, with individuals from within the group of mostly black-clad demonstrators breaking store windows, throwing newspaper boxes, spray-painting cars, smashing parking meters and hurling rocks at officers.How precisely to define the group has been an issue in court, where prosecutors and defense attorneys have sparred outside of the presence of the jury over the use and definition of the term “antifa.” Ultimately, Superior Court Judge Lynn Leibovitz told jurors that “antifa is short for anti-fascist or anti-fascism” and that the term was “not as an indication that individuals themselves intended violence.” Under threat from the judge, prosecutors and witnesses have also had to avoid the use of the term “black bloc,” a reference to a protest tactic intended to anonymize individuals within the group.But in her opening statement in the trial on Nov. 20, Kerkhoff repeatedly referred to a “sea of black masks” that caused destruction that day. The possession or wearing of black clothing has become a central aspect of the prosecution’s case. During one day of the trial, she held up a skull cap featuring an image of a skull that was seized from defendant Christina Simmons, a 20-year-old from Maryland who offered snacks from her backpack to officers who processed her, according to her defense attorney.Jurors have heard from numerous business owners and employees who had their property damaged by members of the group that day. They’ve also heard from numerous police officers about the chaos they encountered, including an officer injured as he tried to apprehend an individual who threw a patio chair at his colleague.What jurors haven’t heard, and prosecutors don’t intend to offer, is evidence that any of the six individuals currently on trial ― Macchio, Simmons, Jennifer Armento, Oliver Harris, Brittne Lawson and Alexei Wood ― actually engaged in any property damage or violence. Under the government’s theory of the case, in which anyone arrested in the group is part of a conspiracy and is responsible for any actions taken by others, the lack of individualized wrongdoing doesn’t matter. Prosecutors have charged all six with eight charges, including six felonies. If convicted, they’d be exposed to a potential maximum sentence of more than 60 years in federal prison (though such an extreme sentence is extraordinarily unlikely).“Each of them made a choice, and each of them played a role,” Kerkhoff told jurors in her opening statement. “You don’t personally have to be the one who breaks the window to be guilty of rioting.”Kerkhoff, who is leading the prosecution, works for the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, one of 94 U.S. attorney’s offices within the Justice Department. The U.S. attorney’s office in the nation’s capital is unique in that it prosecutes both federal crimes and local crimes that would normally be handled by a local prosecutor, who are typically elected. The office in D.C. is currently headed by a Trump appointee named Jessie Liu, though the cases unfolded until September under former acting U.S. Attorney Channing Phillips, a holdover from the Obama administration who is close with former Attorney General Eric Holder.At the moment, there’s no way to ascribe the handling of these prosecutions to Trump political appointees with any degree of certainty. But it’s certainly worth considering that Trump, who branded himself as the law-and-order candidate, had vowed to “end” the “anti-police atmosphere” in America and has made his feelings about protesters on the left well known.The White House website, updated on the day of the inauguration, says the Trump administration would not “make life more comfortable for the rioter, the looter, or the violent disrupter.” More recently, after the deadly August attack in Charlottesville, Virginia, during a white supremacist rally, the president has talked about the “advent of antifa” and compared the loosely-organized anti-fascist movement to actual neo-Nazis.The Trump administration’s charging policy could have also had an impact on the handling of the cases. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who has spoken out about his belief that free speech is under attack on college campuses, ordered federal prosecutors in May to “charge and pursue the most serious, readily provable offense” possible. Kerkhoff and her colleague, Assistant U.S. Attorney Rizwan Qureshi, have presented jurors with a plethora of evidence from Jan. 20: surveillance videos, aerial footage, body cam video, data from all of the cellphones they seized, and even a livestream of the entire march that was shot by Wood, photographer among the defendants. Over and over again, jurors have seen individuals clad in black destroying property during the march. In lengthy and at times tedious presentations, they’ve used videos, screenshots, maps and PowerPoint presentations to prove that the defendants were, in fact, present at the march. The not-so-implicit message to the jury: Someone needed to be held accountable for the damage inflicted that day.The backdrop of the aggressive charges against so many demonstrators is that law enforcement officials in D.C., home to frequent protests due to its status as the nation’s capital, have taken a relatively progressive approach to policing demonstrations in recent years following lawsuits over their past conduct. Ahead of the inauguration, demonstration organizers discussed their perceptions of the restrictions on police, with one podcast played for jurors referring to D.C. police as “trained little piggies” who had been sued into a “state of fear.”The District of Columbia does have rules that officers are supposed to follow when policing a First Amendment demonstration, and defense attorneys have zeroed in on the inconsistencies between what police are supposed to do and what they actually did.Did they issue a warning to disperse, as required? “We didn’t give any dispersal orders,” testified Commander Keith Deville. “We weren’t required to tell them, ‘stop rioting.’”Deville, who oversaw the law enforcement response to downtown demonstrations on Jan. 20, testified that he believed Metropolitan Police Department officers showed “enormous restraint” in their handling of the demonstrations. But defense attorneys played a number of clips that appeared to show officers casually deploying pepper spray, even on individuals who had their backs turned to the officers and were walking away. They also played clips that showed officers roughly handling individuals who weren’t engaged in any wrongdoing, including video that showed a legal observer getting blindsided with a shove from behind.In one instance, Deville testified he couldn’t say why an officer shoved a woman with a baton from behind, but said the technique was proper. “There were two hands on it,” he said. “They weren’t bludgeoning somebody.” In another instance, he said he was “not sure what that deployment was for” when confronted with a video of an officer casually spraying people. “I don’t know what their intention was,” Deville said about another clip that appeared to show improper use of pepper spray.Among D.C. elected officials, questions about how police handled the demonstrations has been a matter of controversy. The D.C. City Council has budgeted $150,000 to investigate how police dealt with the unrest that day. There’s also an outstanding ACLU lawsuit, and Deville admitted that he believes “criminal convictions in this case would perhaps limit our civil liability in the matter.”In a separate tense exchange, a defense attorney questioned Deville about past allegations that he had displayed bias toward some minority groups.Deville admitted repeating a conversation he once had with another officer about the Holocaust Museum road being named after Raoul Wallenberg, who has been credited with saving the lives of tens of thousands of Jews during the Nazi occupation of Hungary. The other officer had referred to Wallenberg as “the one that got away,” a comment Deville apparently repeated over the years. He called it a “very morose comment.” But Deville testified that he was not biased against Jewish people. Deville also denied that he was biased against gay people despite allegedly once warning his colleagues to watch what they said when a gay officer joined their unit. And Deville further said that he was not biased against transgender people, despite once complaining that he had to call a transgender women he’d worked with for four years “Jessica” instead of “Bill.” At the time, Deville said, he “was still trying get my head around the change,” but he was not complaining that he had to call her Jessica. He was disciplined by the department for the comment.The prosecution is expected to wrap up their case on Monday, and the defense will likely take over the rest of the week. The jury may begin deliberations sometime next week.Even if none of these six defendants are convicted, the legal process on its own will still have proven to be a significant form of punishment, with the defendants from various parts of the country essentially moving to D.C. for the duration of the trial.While the defendants have, for the most part, been reluctant to speak with the handful of reporters who have sporadically covered the trial over the past few weeks, Elizabeth Lagesse was willing to chat. Sitting in a courtroom taking careful, copious notes, it’d be easy to mistake her for a reporter. But Lagesse is actually a co-defendant, facing her own trial in July with a separate group of individuals on several felony charges in connection with her own Inauguration Day arrest.Lagesse, a former John Hopkins University graduate student who had been planning to move to California and pursue work in the tech sector, said her life has essentially been put on hold as she fights off felony charges that could jeopardize her future. She and her fiancé, who was also arrested that day, have moved to D.C. to defray the cost of traveling back and forth from Baltimore for hearings. They’ve been living on his salary alone, not necessarily an easy feat in the city, and are now committed to a year lease.Prosecutors still have the cell phone they seized from her that day, “We finally saved up and ordered a new phone,” Lagesse said. “But he’s been using like a broken, not that great phone. I got one awhile back that, you know, works. It has been a really big burden. We’ve had to coordinate, like, whose phone works today?” She says prosecutors were not able to get anything off of either of their phones because they were encrypted iPhones.Lagesse, who wrote an op-ed for The New York Times about her experience and is part of an ACLU lawsuit against D.C. police over their conduct that day, says Jan. 20 was the first time she’d ever been arrested. This is also the first time she’s spent significant time inside a courtroom.She called the process “incredibly frustrating” and scary. “One person makes a decision, and it can disrupt 200 people’s lives for more than a year. It just seems nuts,” Lagesse said.But it’s also been kind of fascinating for her.“Lawyers have told me that they never get to hear the whole case before they start a trial, so it’s kind of an amazing opportunity. You get to watch a do-over trial,” Lagesse said. “It just proves I can nerd out about anything.”Lagesse, who grew up in a conservative family living in northern California, said her family of Trump supporters had a tough time accepting that she was actually facing several felony charges.“It’s hard for a lot of people to believe that this is actually happening, because it is insane. I get that a lot,” Lagesse said. “This is happening. It’s every bit as crazy as it looks. No, it’s not just going to go away.” The partner of defendant Brittne Lawson, a 27-year-old nurse from Pittsburgh, told HuffPost that she had to quit her job because there was no way to adjust her schedule to accommodate a trial that will likely stretch on for more than a month. “The trial is for sure longer than all of Brit’s potential vacation time for the whole year,” Lawson’s partner, who requested to be identified only by his first name of Jeff, said. “This is a full-time job.”Lawson has been able to get housing in Washington during the trial though the Dead City Legal Posse, an organization formed to support the defendants shortly after their mass arrest.“Frankly, when you’re going through something really stressful like this, you want a quiet space that is your own, that feels safe,” Jeff said. “And instead you’re like sleeping on somebody’s couch.”Jeff said he believes that people from across the political spectrum should be able to recognize the threat of the aggressive prosecution, but said that even some members of their extended families had bought into the idea of cracking down on protests.“You see the divisions within the U.S., where there’s some people in our extended family who are like, ‘Oh, you should be in jail forever for someone else in a protest you were at breaking windows,’” Jeff said.Defense attorneys will be calling several witnesses this week, and several of the defendants may take the stand in their own defense. Wood, the photographer on trial, will likely explain to the jury why he had a press pass in another individual’s name.The six defendants’ attorneys, who outnumber the actual jury, will likely also raise First Amendment concerns and say that police made no effort to differentiate between those who were exercising their rights and those who were causing destruction. Steven McCool, who is representing defendant Harris, told the judge outside of the presence of the jury last week that he’d be requesting a jury instruction on the First Amendment. What kind of jury instruction, Judge Lynn Leibovitz wondered, one that said we “like it a lot?”“I wish we liked it more,” replied McCool, a former federal prosecutor. “Apparently we don’t.” Ryan Reilly is HuffPost’s senior justice reporter, covering criminal justice, federal law enforcement and legal affairs.

6,POLITICS,The Nazi-Puncher's Dilemma,Luke O'Brien,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nazi-punch-antifa_us_59e13ae9e4b03a7be580ce6f,"Inside the antifa movement's struggle to continue its long, colorful legacy of cracking white supremacist heads without alienating, well, just about everyone.",2017-12-10,A man in a swastika shirt is punched outside a Richard Spencer speech at the University of Florida on Oct. 19.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59ef52e1180000051bdfbf5b.jpeg?cache=qiNpkIQmly&ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― There is a growing desire in this country to punch Nazis in the face. At least, this is what I hear from people who punch Nazis in the face. Some gleefully send me videos of other people punching Nazis in the face, such as the one from September featuring a Nazi in Seattle who threw a banana at a man and, in return, ate a very professional right cross. The Nazi fell to the ground and lay there unconscious. When he came to, he removed his Nazi armband and shuffled off.Anyone following the news knows who’s doing the bulk of this Nazi-punching: “antifa.” It’s an esoteric and often confounding term. Although short for “anti-fascist” — an expansive category that one would imagine includes millions of Americans — “antifa” has quickly come to connote a very specific stereotype: a black-clad, violent, leftist subversive.Most Americans first learned about antifa in February, when what looked like a gang of ninjas set fires and broke windows to stop Milo Yiannopoulos, a race-baiting former Breitbart News editor, from speaking on the University of California, Berkeley campus, where he reportedly intended to out undocumented students. About a week after the deadly white supremacist riot in Charlottesville, Virginia, President Donald Trump seized on antifa as Exhibit A in his ongoing efforts to blame “both sides” for the violence. During a speech in Phoenix, Trump played up the word’s alien vibrations as if he were, to borrow a Trevor Noah joke, introducing a band at the Latin Grammys: “An-TEE-fa!” Their notoriety may be new, but antifa have a long, complicated history of militant community activism. This history has involved a lot of Nazi-punching, but it’s also about much more than that. In the course of my reporting on the alt-right over the past year, I’ve talked to several older anti-fascists who have been doing the “work” for decades. They told me about pitched battles in the street with Nazis from another era, about raiding Klan rallies under cover of darkness, about cops in cahoots with white supremacists, and about Nazis torching the homes of activists and killing antifa in the desert. I heard about duffel bags filled with barbells and knives and a legendary anti-fascist who was attacked by a brass-knuckle-wielding Nazi and responded by breaking the fascist’s teeth with a Maglite flashlight. These exploits sounded fantastical, but when I looked into them, they were true.The antifa vets were more strategic than I anticipated and obsessively knowledgeable about politics. They all had extreme personalities, although time had precipitated out a little of their tannin. Some had children and normal lives. The Maglite legend, I’d heard, was now a kids’ soccer coach. Still, they were tight-lipped about their activities, some of which were illegal, and were often misunderstood.Anti-facism is a loose-knit, decentralized movement containing numerous organizations and ideologies that even insiders struggle to explain. For starters, not all people who identify as anti-fascists describe themselves as antifa. Most antifa are anarchists, but there are also socialists and communists, who divide further into Maoists, Marxists, Trotskyists and Stalinist “tankies.”What unites them is a belief that dangerous elements of the far right must be driven from the public square, even if by force. And for two decades, beginning in the mid-1980s, that’s what antifa attempted to do, almost entirely out of the public eye. They put neo-Nazis and other white supremacists on their heels in cities and suburbs around the country, forcing many of them underground or into retreat. (Other contributing factors: litigation by civil rights organizations, the demise of key white supremacist leaders and law enforcement roundups.)Over the past year, as fascists and racists have reemerged, emboldened by the rise of Trump, many old-school antifa have laced up their boots again. But now they find themselves facing a new enemy. The current crop of neo-Nazis and white nationalists prefers tattersall to tattoos and come off more like Young Republicans than Hammerskins. They are proficient in social media and online messaging, which presents a challenge for antifa used to fighting in the shadows.“When you have Richard Spencer getting punched in the face, millions of people see it,” said Oren Segal, the director of the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism. Millions of people might also feel a pang of sympathy for Spencer. Others might use the video to demonize the left or justify a crackdown on public protest. In an age of insta-propaganda, it’s hard to know: Is punching Nazis actually helping the Nazis?If New Orleans gave us jazz, Minneapolis gave us antifa. Gangs of skinheads scrapping in cold Midwestern alleys — that’s how organized anti-fascism in America was born, in the counter-culture punk scene of the 1980s. The skinheads listened to ska and punk and wore steel-toed Doc Martens and Fred Perry shirts. The original skinhead movement was multiracial and working class, and it drew heavily from Jamaican “rude boy” culture. But in the 1980s, white power groups invaded the scene, giving rise to thousands of “boneheads” — neo-Nazi skinheads.In Minneapolis, one bonehead set called the White Knights started beating up minority kids and menacing leftists in the punk rock crowd. It was stomp or get stomped, and a multiracial crew of “traditional” skins called the Baldies decided to fight back. The Baldies’ turf was the Uptown neighborhood. If the Baldies caught Nazis in Uptown, they’d tell them to leave. If the Nazis didn’t leave, the Baldies put a hurt on them. The White Knights cleared out of Uptown. Before long, they cleared out of Minneapolis. In 1987, the Baldies joined with other leftist and anarchist activists to form Anti-Racist Action, which would become the mother organization for anti-fascism in America. The ARA focused not only on neighborhood Nazis but also on systemic racism. “We go where they go” was the ARA’s first guiding principle, and the organization’s tactics evolved beyond fisticuffs. ARA members painted over racist graffiti and disrupted the sales of white power music. They put out political literature, held demonstrations and did door knocks, volunteered in schools to educate kids about racism, protested wars and did environmental activism and labor organizing. One of the ARA’s priorities was defending reproductive rights. Members regularly stood guard outside abortion clinics, which the far right menaced with Nazi muscle.The ARA also pioneered a tactic known today as doxing — exposing fascists and racists in order to shame them in their communities. Back then, it was a lot more labor-intensive. “When you see someone passing out white supremacist flyers or not getting prosecuted for hate crimes, you dig deeper and try to find out who the person is,” explains an anti-fascist in western Pennsylvania with two decades of experience who goes by Lady. “We would make a list of their actions against our friends, neighbors and the community. We’d write it into a little story and put it on a flyer with a picture of them we’d usually have to snap ourselves. Then we’d walk around their community and put the flyer on light poles and cars. We’d usually call it something like, ‘Meet your neighborhood racist.’”To ARA members, there was no point expecting help from the cops, many of whom antifa knew were themselves racist. And they dismissed liberals as the same kind of pearl-clutching appeasers who’d allowed Hitler and Mussolini to seize power in the 1930s. Antifa would go it alone. By 1998, ARA reportedly had more than 100 chapters and 2,000 members across North America, as well as several newspapers and a hotline to receive tips about white supremacists. Its policy on fascists was simple: Don’t allow white supremacists any platform to normalize a violent ideology. As Gerry Bello, a longtime member of Columbus ARA in Ohio, put it: “Hitler himself said the only way you could have beaten us if you’d smashed us off the street from the very first day and with the utmost brutality.” Antifa weren’t exaggerating the threat of violence. Many remember the night in 1998 when two women lured Dan Shersty and Lin “Spit” Newborn, two ARA members, into the desert near Las Vegas. Instead of a party, the young antifa found a group of neo-Nazis. According to media accounts, Shersty was barely out of his car when a gun blast opened up his chest. The fascists dragged Newborn deeper into the desert and shot him to pieces. Only one of the neo-Nazis, John “Polar Bear” Butler, was convicted of the murders. Another person later took a plea deal.The violence, however, cut both ways. Although antifa tended to show more restraint on the battlefield, they still put plenty of Nazis in the hospital. “Shit happens,” Bello explains. “These are fights involving weapons. Sometimes one of them will catch a right proper boot party. There’s quite a few times where if we wanted to put them in the morgue they would be in the morgue.”Perhaps the first time that antifa really entered public view was during the protests against globalization at the 1999 World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle, when a small contingent of masked anarchists in black famously smashed up police cars and the windows of corporate offices in acts of “symbolic violence.” (Many antifa view capitalism as an engine of systemic racism.) The “Battle of Seattle” was essentially the American debut of the “black bloc” tactic, which was first used in Germany. The idea was that if the entire bloc dressed in black and wore masks, a few activists could vandalize property and then blend anonymously back into the ensemble, making it almost impossible for police to figure out whom to arrest. From that point, black bloc became the de facto uniform for antifa when they deployed in large groups.Like they did in York, a small blue-collar city in south-central Pennsylvania and the site of a historic antifa victory.In 2002, Matt Hale, the leader of a major white supremacist organization, the World Church of the Creator, staged a rally in a mostly black and Latino part of York. His purpose was to support York’s mayor, Charlie Robertson. At the time, Robertson was under investigation for his connection to a murder that occurred during a deadly race riot in York in the 1960s. Robertson would later admit that while serving as a police officer during the riot, he had shouted “White power!” to an angry mob. He had also allegedly supplied ammunition to white gang members and told them to “kill as many niggers as you can.” The gang members shot a black woman to death. None of them was ever charged — but a deathbed confession by one of the gangsters almost 30 years later had finally exposed Robertson’s involvement.Hale’s rally drew well over 100 white supremacists to York. Antifa showed up in equivalent or greater numbers, according to multiple participants. As the anti-fascists walked into York, local black teenagers emerged from their homes, ready to join them in battle. Antifa helped them don masks, according to one activist who was there. This is what antifa say they work hardest to achieve: a community empowered to defend itself, with anti-fascists playing a supporting role.Hale was speechifying inside a library, with bonehead foot soldiers posted outside. Riot police and state troopers were there to keep the peace. But when smaller groups of Nazis began slipping off to the side of the library, antifa pursued them through alleys with the guidance of the locals. “It broke up into several small unit combats all over the city for hours,” Bello says. “They have this thing, I’ve only seen it in York. You know those old metal garbage cans? They had this way to skip them off the ground and have them come up at teeth height.”A large group of antifa turned into an alley. Chain-link fence on the left. Brick wall on the right. About 80 feet away down the alley was a cluster of Nazi skinheads. Antifa charged straight for them. A Nazi in a pickup came flying down the alley, according to newspaper accounts and two anti-fascists who were there. He hit two antifa, breaking a teenage girl’s arm and raking another person down the fence for 20 feet, then screeched out of the alley and bounced a girl as young as 8 off his bumper. To leave town, the white supremacists needed an armed escort from the police for almost a mile.Antifa put the boot to neo-Nazis in other cities, too, such as Toronto, and in the suburbs and edge towns of major metropolises like Columbus, Montreal, Chicago, Detroit and Louisville. Heidi Beirich, an extremism expert at the Southern Poverty Law Center, noted that Rose City Antifa’s aggressive tactics in Portland, Oregon, drove the dangerous founder of a murderous neo-Nazi gang out of town. They also went after the Klan, often with similar results. By the mid-2000s, with organized white supremacy seemingly on the wane, the ARA national network began to atrophy. People moved on, settled down, shifted their energy to other causes or retired. Then along came Trump.The alt-right might have been active before 2016, but Trump’s candidacy ushered a new generation of white supremacy onto the national stage. Not since Nixon has a president so openly courted fascists and racists.Antifa I spoke with have reported an uptick of new, younger members in response. And older members are swinging back into action, too, either actively or in quieter, supporting roles. “We got motherfuckers coming up out of the bathroom tiles like ‘Terminator 2,’” Bello says. ARA chapters have reorganized across the country, and other groups, such as Redneck Revolt, a pro-worker, anti-racist organization with almost 30 branches nationwide, have readied for action.But while the alt-right might have copped its ideology from old-guard neo-Nazis and Klansmen, many of its leaders are savvy propagandists. And antifa violence is easy for them to exploit, especially when inflicted upon preppy antagonists. “To a large extent, the narrative within antifa circles is kind of machismo. It’s about winning battles against the Nazis,” says Cas Mudde, an extremism expert and professor at the University of Georgia. “If you actually beat up 25 big, bulky skinheads, the battle has been won. If you beat up Polo-wearing kids in the suburbs, what have you achieved?”One ill-considered punch can now obscure the more meritorious blows. Already faded from collective memory are episodes like the one in Charlottesville when antifa fought off baton-wielding white supremacists who were about to attack a line of clergy. (“Antifa saved my life twice on Saturday,” said Rev. Seth Wispelwey, a local minister.) Far more potent are the viral videos, like the one of antifa in Berkeley flattening a MAGA bro. They allow conservatives to brand all antifa as dangerous extremists — in part to create a convenient alibi for their own more dangerous extremists.And far-right extremists are far more dangerous. A report from the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point found that from 1990 to 2012, far-right extremists were responsible for 670 fatalities, 3,053 injuries and 4,420 violent attacks in the United States. No such data exist for antifa, but in the three decades of antifa’s organized existence in America, only one known fatality caused by a member of an antifa group has been recorded, when in 1993 a multiracial skin shot a Nazi skin during a fight at a gas station in Portland and was convicted of manslaughter.Nevertheless, Trump and others frequently portray the violence as an equal problem on “both sides.” In an ouroboros of political dishonesty, right-wingers have even taken to attacking antifa with comparisons to the most toxic elements of the Republican base. In August, Marc Thiessen, a Washington Post columnist and former staffer for the racist Sen. Jesse Helms, wrote that antifa are “no different from neo-Nazis.” In September, Attorney General Jeff Sessions likened antifa to the Ku Klux Klan. And then there are extremists such as Gavin McInnes, a Vice co-founder and the leader of the Proud Boys, a Trump-supporting racist “fraternity,” who consistently tries to brand anti-fascists as “fascists.”Less than a week after antifa stepped in to protect clergy from violent fascists and white supremacists in Charlottesville, a White House petition was created to declare antifa a terrorist organization. It garnered hundreds of thousands of signatures within days. (The Department of Homeland Security under President Barack Obama had reportedly already classified antifa’s activities as “domestic terrorist violence.”) At the end of November, Christopher Wray, the FBI director appointed by Trump after the president fired James Comey, told the House Homeland Security Committee that the bureau was investigating a number of people “who are motivated to commit violent criminal activity on kind of an antifa ideology.”By then, far-right propagandists had been smearing antifa for months. Many of them, including Lucian Wintrich, a Gateway Pundit writer who is credentialed by the White House and pals around with white supremacists, hyped a conspiracy theory about how antifa “supersoldiers” planned to mass-decapitate white parents and start another American civil war. An official magazine of the National Rifle Association published a scare story that depicted antifa as brutal thugs and claimed that “when the TV cameras are absent, the far left secretly agrees with [the] goals” of this “violent, disgusting and destructive” movement.“If you just look at the discourse today within Breitbart or the NRA or even Tucker Carlson, they make the case that these are the storm troopers of the Democratic Party,” Mudde says. “It is very problematic in that it distracts from the alt-right, which is already a bit of a distraction from the structural racism in the Republican Party.”Some antifa elect to pursue nonviolent tactics as a matter of both practicality and public relations. Daryle Lamont Jenkins runs One People’s Project, which does deep research into the organizational networks and funding sources of the far right. To Jenkins and other like-minded activists, information warfare is more important than ever as the alt-right tries to insinuate itself into the conservative establishment and the political mainstream. Jenkins has also pulled several Nazis out of the movement and helped rehabilitate them.One of Jenkins’ longtime colleagues, Laura Sennett, takes it a step further. Sennett is a photographer and middle-aged Jewish suburbanite who lives in the Washington area. She got into activism after covering a neo-Nazi rally in Toledo, Ohio, that turned into a riot. “Sometimes when I want to shock people, I say, ‘I’m an antifa,’” she tells me. ”And they look me up and down. I’ve got my regular clothes and my nails and my perfume. I look like an art teacher,” she says. “But if I tell people I’m anti-fascist, I get, ‘Oh, that’s wonderful! More power to you.’”Sennett tries to connect with white supremacists and change how they see the world. The self-described “antifa yenta” has, for instance, baked cookies for Richard Spencer and tried to sprinkle different ideas into his diet. She is critical of violence for violence’s sake, particularly what she calls the “fuck shit up” culture among Berkeley antifa. “Their anti-fascism is becoming a tool for fascism. You have to choose between what makes you feel better and what is actually right and effective.”But activists like Sennett and Jenkins are a minority. “I have been shunned by people in the antifa community because I suggested a diversity of tactics that weren’t the standard,” Sennett says. “We’ve got to do something that’s violent or vandalism. And for some reason if you do anything that diverts from these kinds of tactics, you’re a traitor.” (Her approach hasn’t helped her avoid attention from law enforcement: In 2008, the FBI raided Sennett’s home and seized her computers, cameras and memory cards, seeking pictures she’d taken of an anarchist demonstration.)If the militant antifa I spoke to were concerned that social media could be used against them, they didn’t elaborate. “No matter how good we are, it’s going to happen anyway. We’re going to get vilified,” Bello says. Some antifa argued that fisticuff videos simply attract more supporters to their cause. White nationalists made the same argument. Spencer has called the punch he took a good thing because “it woke up the whole movement” and pushed the alt-right into a new gear.But antifa, too, were in a different gear, with new ARA chapters and other organizations forming around the country. Militant vets view the fight against white supremacists as a war. “I don’t see those two groups standing across from each other 10 to 15 times more and there not being significantly more violence,” Mudde says. “And then we have a different situation.”So what, ultimately, does one old antifa head think is to be done about the scrubbed-up, boy-next-door alt-right? What, in other words, should he do about Pepe?“Punch anybody who wears it.”CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated the last name of Lin “Spit” Newborn as Newman."

At least, this is what I hear from people who punch Nazis in the face. Some gleefully send me videos of other people punching Nazis in the face, such as the one from September featuring a Nazi in Seattle who threw a banana at a man and, in return, ate a very professional right cross. The Nazi fell to the ground and lay there unconscious. When he came to, he removed his Nazi armband and shuffled off.Anyone following the news knows who’s doing the bulk of this Nazi-punching: “antifa.” It’s an esoteric and often confounding term. Although short for “anti-fascist” — an expansive category that one would imagine includes millions of Americans — “antifa” has quickly come to connote a very specific stereotype: a black-clad, violent, leftist subversive.Most Americans first learned about antifa in February, when what looked like a gang of ninjas set fires and broke windows to stop Milo Yiannopoulos, a race-baiting former Breitbart News editor, from speaking on the University of California, Berkeley campus, where he reportedly intended to out undocumented students. About a week after the deadly white supremacist riot in Charlottesville, Virginia, President Donald Trump seized on antifa as Exhibit A in his ongoing efforts to blame “both sides” for the violence. During a speech in Phoenix, Trump played up the word’s alien vibrations as if he were, to borrow a Trevor Noah joke, introducing a band at the Latin Grammys: “An-TEE-fa!” Their notoriety may be new, but antifa have a long, complicated history of militant community activism. This history has involved a lot of Nazi-punching, but it’s also about much more than that. In the course of my reporting on the alt-right over the past year, I’ve talked to several older anti-fascists who have been doing the “work” for decades. They told me about pitched battles in the street with Nazis from another era, about raiding Klan rallies under cover of darkness, about cops in cahoots with white supremacists, and about Nazis torching the homes of activists and killing antifa in the desert. I heard about duffel bags filled with barbells and knives and a legendary anti-fascist who was attacked by a brass-knuckle-wielding Nazi and responded by breaking the fascist’s teeth with a Maglite flashlight. These exploits sounded fantastical, but when I looked into them, they were true.The antifa vets were more strategic than I anticipated and obsessively knowledgeable about politics. They all had extreme personalities, although time had precipitated out a little of their tannin. Some had children and normal lives. The Maglite legend, I’d heard, was now a kids’ soccer coach. Still, they were tight-lipped about their activities, some of which were illegal, and were often misunderstood.Anti-facism is a loose-knit, decentralized movement containing numerous organizations and ideologies that even insiders struggle to explain. For starters, not all people who identify as anti-fascists describe themselves as antifa. Most antifa are anarchists, but there are also socialists and communists, who divide further into Maoists, Marxists, Trotskyists and Stalinist “tankies.”What unites them is a belief that dangerous elements of the far right must be driven from the public square, even if by force. And for two decades, beginning in the mid-1980s, that’s what antifa attempted to do, almost entirely out of the public eye. They put neo-Nazis and other white supremacists on their heels in cities and suburbs around the country, forcing many of them underground or into retreat. (Other contributing factors: litigation by civil rights organizations, the demise of key white supremacist leaders and law enforcement roundups.)Over the past year, as fascists and racists have reemerged, emboldened by the rise of Trump, many old-school antifa have laced up their boots again. But now they find themselves facing a new enemy. The current crop of neo-Nazis and white nationalists prefers tattersall to tattoos and come off more like Young Republicans than Hammerskins. They are proficient in social media and online messaging, which presents a challenge for antifa used to fighting in the shadows.“When you have Richard Spencer getting punched in the face, millions of people see it,” said Oren Segal, the director of the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism. Millions of people might also feel a pang of sympathy for Spencer. Others might use the video to demonize the left or justify a crackdown on public protest. In an age of insta-propaganda, it’s hard to know: Is punching Nazis actually helping the Nazis?If New Orleans gave us jazz, Minneapolis gave us antifa. Gangs of skinheads scrapping in cold Midwestern alleys — that’s how organized anti-fascism in America was born, in the counter-culture punk scene of the 1980s. The skinheads listened to ska and punk and wore steel-toed Doc Martens and Fred Perry shirts. The original skinhead movement was multiracial and working class, and it drew heavily from Jamaican “rude boy” culture. But in the 1980s, white power groups invaded the scene, giving rise to thousands of “boneheads” — neo-Nazi skinheads.In Minneapolis, one bonehead set called the White Knights started beating up minority kids and menacing leftists in the punk rock crowd. It was stomp or get stomped, and a multiracial crew of “traditional” skins called the Baldies decided to fight back. The Baldies’ turf was the Uptown neighborhood. If the Baldies caught Nazis in Uptown, they’d tell them to leave. If the Nazis didn’t leave, the Baldies put a hurt on them. The White Knights cleared out of Uptown. Before long, they cleared out of Minneapolis. In 1987, the Baldies joined with other leftist and anarchist activists to form Anti-Racist Action, which would become the mother organization for anti-fascism in America. The ARA focused not only on neighborhood Nazis but also on systemic racism. “We go where they go” was the ARA’s first guiding principle, and the organization’s tactics evolved beyond fisticuffs. ARA members painted over racist graffiti and disrupted the sales of white power music. They put out political literature, held demonstrations and did door knocks, volunteered in schools to educate kids about racism, protested wars and did environmental activism and labor organizing. One of the ARA’s priorities was defending reproductive rights. Members regularly stood guard outside abortion clinics, which the far right menaced with Nazi muscle.The ARA also pioneered a tactic known today as doxing — exposing fascists and racists in order to shame them in their communities. Back then, it was a lot more labor-intensive. “When you see someone passing out white supremacist flyers or not getting prosecuted for hate crimes, you dig deeper and try to find out who the person is,” explains an anti-fascist in western Pennsylvania with two decades of experience who goes by Lady. “We would make a list of their actions against our friends, neighbors and the community. We’d write it into a little story and put it on a flyer with a picture of them we’d usually have to snap ourselves. Then we’d walk around their community and put the flyer on light poles and cars. We’d usually call it something like, ‘Meet your neighborhood racist.’”To ARA members, there was no point expecting help from the cops, many of whom antifa knew were themselves racist. And they dismissed liberals as the same kind of pearl-clutching appeasers who’d allowed Hitler and Mussolini to seize power in the 1930s. Antifa would go it alone. By 1998, ARA reportedly had more than 100 chapters and 2,000 members across North America, as well as several newspapers and a hotline to receive tips about white supremacists. Its policy on fascists was simple: Don’t allow white supremacists any platform to normalize a violent ideology. As Gerry Bello, a longtime member of Columbus ARA in Ohio, put it: “Hitler himself said the only way you could have beaten us if you’d smashed us off the street from the very first day and with the utmost brutality.” Antifa weren’t exaggerating the threat of violence. Many remember the night in 1998 when two women lured Dan Shersty and Lin “Spit” Newborn, two ARA members, into the desert near Las Vegas. Instead of a party, the young antifa found a group of neo-Nazis. According to media accounts, Shersty was barely out of his car when a gun blast opened up his chest. The fascists dragged Newborn deeper into the desert and shot him to pieces. Only one of the neo-Nazis, John “Polar Bear” Butler, was convicted of the murders. Another person later took a plea deal.The violence, however, cut both ways. Although antifa tended to show more restraint on the battlefield, they still put plenty of Nazis in the hospital. “Shit happens,” Bello explains. “These are fights involving weapons. Sometimes one of them will catch a right proper boot party. There’s quite a few times where if we wanted to put them in the morgue they would be in the morgue.”Perhaps the first time that antifa really entered public view was during the protests against globalization at the 1999 World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle, when a small contingent of masked anarchists in black famously smashed up police cars and the windows of corporate offices in acts of “symbolic violence.” (Many antifa view capitalism as an engine of systemic racism.) The “Battle of Seattle” was essentially the American debut of the “black bloc” tactic, which was first used in Germany. The idea was that if the entire bloc dressed in black and wore masks, a few activists could vandalize property and then blend anonymously back into the ensemble, making it almost impossible for police to figure out whom to arrest. From that point, black bloc became the de facto uniform for antifa when they deployed in large groups.Like they did in York, a small blue-collar city in south-central Pennsylvania and the site of a historic antifa victory.In 2002, Matt Hale, the leader of a major white supremacist organization, the World Church of the Creator, staged a rally in a mostly black and Latino part of York. His purpose was to support York’s mayor, Charlie Robertson. At the time, Robertson was under investigation for his connection to a murder that occurred during a deadly race riot in York in the 1960s. Robertson would later admit that while serving as a police officer during the riot, he had shouted “White power!” to an angry mob. He had also allegedly supplied ammunition to white gang members and told them to “kill as many niggers as you can.” The gang members shot a black woman to death. None of them was ever charged — but a deathbed confession by one of the gangsters almost 30 years later had finally exposed Robertson’s involvement.Hale’s rally drew well over 100 white supremacists to York. Antifa showed up in equivalent or greater numbers, according to multiple participants. As the anti-fascists walked into York, local black teenagers emerged from their homes, ready to join them in battle. Antifa helped them don masks, according to one activist who was there. This is what antifa say they work hardest to achieve: a community empowered to defend itself, with anti-fascists playing a supporting role.Hale was speechifying inside a library, with bonehead foot soldiers posted outside. Riot police and state troopers were there to keep the peace. But when smaller groups of Nazis began slipping off to the side of the library, antifa pursued them through alleys with the guidance of the locals. “It broke up into several small unit combats all over the city for hours,” Bello says. “They have this thing, I’ve only seen it in York. You know those old metal garbage cans? They had this way to skip them off the ground and have them come up at teeth height.”A large group of antifa turned into an alley. Chain-link fence on the left. Brick wall on the right. About 80 feet away down the alley was a cluster of Nazi skinheads. Antifa charged straight for them. A Nazi in a pickup came flying down the alley, according to newspaper accounts and two anti-fascists who were there. He hit two antifa, breaking a teenage girl’s arm and raking another person down the fence for 20 feet, then screeched out of the alley and bounced a girl as young as 8 off his bumper. To leave town, the white supremacists needed an armed escort from the police for almost a mile.Antifa put the boot to neo-Nazis in other cities, too, such as Toronto, and in the suburbs and edge towns of major metropolises like Columbus, Montreal, Chicago, Detroit and Louisville. Heidi Beirich, an extremism expert at the Southern Poverty Law Center, noted that Rose City Antifa’s aggressive tactics in Portland, Oregon, drove the dangerous founder of a murderous neo-Nazi gang out of town. They also went after the Klan, often with similar results. By the mid-2000s, with organized white supremacy seemingly on the wane, the ARA national network began to atrophy. People moved on, settled down, shifted their energy to other causes or retired. Then along came Trump.The alt-right might have been active before 2016, but Trump’s candidacy ushered a new generation of white supremacy onto the national stage. Not since Nixon has a president so openly courted fascists and racists.Antifa I spoke with have reported an uptick of new, younger members in response. And older members are swinging back into action, too, either actively or in quieter, supporting roles. “We got motherfuckers coming up out of the bathroom tiles like ‘Terminator 2,’” Bello says. ARA chapters have reorganized across the country, and other groups, such as Redneck Revolt, a pro-worker, anti-racist organization with almost 30 branches nationwide, have readied for action.But while the alt-right might have copped its ideology from old-guard neo-Nazis and Klansmen, many of its leaders are savvy propagandists. And antifa violence is easy for them to exploit, especially when inflicted upon preppy antagonists. “To a large extent, the narrative within antifa circles is kind of machismo. It’s about winning battles against the Nazis,” says Cas Mudde, an extremism expert and professor at the University of Georgia. “If you actually beat up 25 big, bulky skinheads, the battle has been won. If you beat up Polo-wearing kids in the suburbs, what have you achieved?”One ill-considered punch can now obscure the more meritorious blows. Already faded from collective memory are episodes like the one in Charlottesville when antifa fought off baton-wielding white supremacists who were about to attack a line of clergy. (“Antifa saved my life twice on Saturday,” said Rev. Seth Wispelwey, a local minister.) Far more potent are the viral videos, like the one of antifa in Berkeley flattening a MAGA bro. They allow conservatives to brand all antifa as dangerous extremists — in part to create a convenient alibi for their own more dangerous extremists.And far-right extremists are far more dangerous. A report from the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point found that from 1990 to 2012, far-right extremists were responsible for 670 fatalities, 3,053 injuries and 4,420 violent attacks in the United States. No such data exist for antifa, but in the three decades of antifa’s organized existence in America, only one known fatality caused by a member of an antifa group has been recorded, when in 1993 a multiracial skin shot a Nazi skin during a fight at a gas station in Portland and was convicted of manslaughter.Nevertheless, Trump and others frequently portray the violence as an equal problem on “both sides.” In an ouroboros of political dishonesty, right-wingers have even taken to attacking antifa with comparisons to the most toxic elements of the Republican base. In August, Marc Thiessen, a Washington Post columnist and former staffer for the racist Sen. Jesse Helms, wrote that antifa are “no different from neo-Nazis.” In September, Attorney General Jeff Sessions likened antifa to the Ku Klux Klan. And then there are extremists such as Gavin McInnes, a Vice co-founder and the leader of the Proud Boys, a Trump-supporting racist “fraternity,” who consistently tries to brand anti-fascists as “fascists.”Less than a week after antifa stepped in to protect clergy from violent fascists and white supremacists in Charlottesville, a White House petition was created to declare antifa a terrorist organization. It garnered hundreds of thousands of signatures within days. (The Department of Homeland Security under President Barack Obama had reportedly already classified antifa’s activities as “domestic terrorist violence.”) At the end of November, Christopher Wray, the FBI director appointed by Trump after the president fired James Comey, told the House Homeland Security Committee that the bureau was investigating a number of people “who are motivated to commit violent criminal activity on kind of an antifa ideology.”By then, far-right propagandists had been smearing antifa for months. Many of them, including Lucian Wintrich, a Gateway Pundit writer who is credentialed by the White House and pals around with white supremacists, hyped a conspiracy theory about how antifa “supersoldiers” planned to mass-decapitate white parents and start another American civil war. An official magazine of the National Rifle Association published a scare story that depicted antifa as brutal thugs and claimed that “when the TV cameras are absent, the far left secretly agrees with [the] goals” of this “violent, disgusting and destructive” movement.“If you just look at the discourse today within Breitbart or the NRA or even Tucker Carlson, they make the case that these are the storm troopers of the Democratic Party,” Mudde says. “It is very problematic in that it distracts from the alt-right, which is already a bit of a distraction from the structural racism in the Republican Party.”Some antifa elect to pursue nonviolent tactics as a matter of both practicality and public relations. Daryle Lamont Jenkins runs One People’s Project, which does deep research into the organizational networks and funding sources of the far right. To Jenkins and other like-minded activists, information warfare is more important than ever as the alt-right tries to insinuate itself into the conservative establishment and the political mainstream. Jenkins has also pulled several Nazis out of the movement and helped rehabilitate them.One of Jenkins’ longtime colleagues, Laura Sennett, takes it a step further. Sennett is a photographer and middle-aged Jewish suburbanite who lives in the Washington area. She got into activism after covering a neo-Nazi rally in Toledo, Ohio, that turned into a riot. “Sometimes when I want to shock people, I say, ‘I’m an antifa,’” she tells me. ”And they look me up and down. I’ve got my regular clothes and my nails and my perfume. I look like an art teacher,” she says. “But if I tell people I’m anti-fascist, I get, ‘Oh, that’s wonderful! More power to you.’”Sennett tries to connect with white supremacists and change how they see the world. The self-described “antifa yenta” has, for instance, baked cookies for Richard Spencer and tried to sprinkle different ideas into his diet. She is critical of violence for violence’s sake, particularly what she calls the “fuck shit up” culture among Berkeley antifa. “Their anti-fascism is becoming a tool for fascism. You have to choose between what makes you feel better and what is actually right and effective.”But activists like Sennett and Jenkins are a minority. “I have been shunned by people in the antifa community because I suggested a diversity of tactics that weren’t the standard,” Sennett says. “We’ve got to do something that’s violent or vandalism. And for some reason if you do anything that diverts from these kinds of tactics, you’re a traitor.” (Her approach hasn’t helped her avoid attention from law enforcement: In 2008, the FBI raided Sennett’s home and seized her computers, cameras and memory cards, seeking pictures she’d taken of an anarchist demonstration.)If the militant antifa I spoke to were concerned that social media could be used against them, they didn’t elaborate. “No matter how good we are, it’s going to happen anyway. We’re going to get vilified,” Bello says. Some antifa argued that fisticuff videos simply attract more supporters to their cause. White nationalists made the same argument. Spencer has called the punch he took a good thing because “it woke up the whole movement” and pushed the alt-right into a new gear.But antifa, too, were in a different gear, with new ARA chapters and other organizations forming around the country. Militant vets view the fight against white supremacists as a war. “I don’t see those two groups standing across from each other 10 to 15 times more and there not being significantly more violence,” Mudde says. “And then we have a different situation.”So what, ultimately, does one old antifa head think is to be done about the scrubbed-up, boy-next-door alt-right? What, in other words, should he do about Pepe?“Punch anybody who wears it.”CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated the last name of Lin “Spit” Newborn as Newman."

Graham’s three-day event — similar to the “crusades” once led by his famous father, Billy Graham — is reportedly taking place with the blessing of more than 300 church leaders and members in England. But not all residents of the area are enthused about Graham coming to town. Some have urged the U.K.’s home secretary Amber Rudd to ban the preacher from entering the country altogether, the Guardian reports. Nina Parker, the pastor of a church in Blackpool, told HuffPost in an email that she’s worried that Graham’s visit could embolden those who are prejudiced toward Muslims and queer people to express that hate. “It will give oxygen to those who hate as they will be aware of hatred being expressed by a man of high status in the Church,” Parker wrote to HuffPost. “It will portray a Trump style, hard line, hate filled version of Christianity devoid of understanding of and acceptance of ordinary people. It will destroy the reputation of Christianity in this region as it will be assumed that this man speaks for all. It will bring Christians into disrepute.”Parker has more than 6,000 signatures to an online petition asking the home secretary to stop Graham from coming to the U.K.Paul Maynard, Cat Smith and Gordon Marsden, three members of Parliament from the region, have also called on Rudd to consider banning Graham, according to BBC Radio Lancashire. In an interview with the station in November, Marsden said he’d heard from his constituents, including faith leaders, who told him they were worried about Graham’s visit. Marsden said he’s concerned that Graham could violate the U.K.’s laws against hate speech, given his troubling prior statements. “Personally, as a Christian, I have my own views on people who claim the authority of God and Jesus and then advocate attitudes which appear to be poles apart from what we’re told about in the Gospel,” Marsden said, “but as a member of Parliament — and I have to represent people of all faiths — I have to be concerned about where extreme fundamentalism and where speech or opinions that might stir up hatred against groups of people goes.”“I think frankly the evidence is piling up that his visit to the U.K., and certainly to Blackpool and Lancashire, would not be a good thing and not probably, in my view, a very a Christian thing.”Two Anglican priests in the Blackpool area, The Rev. Canon Andrew Sage and The Rev. Tracy Charnock, have condemned Graham’s rhetoric. In an open letter, they urged their bishop to speak up and distance the local Church of England diocese from Graham. “How else shall we be able to look our Muslim brothers and sisters in the eye?” they wrote in the letter.Graham, a vocal ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, has claimed in the past that Islam is an “evil and wicked religion” and has repeatedly equated the terrorist group known as the Islamic State with the religion followed by 1.6 billion people around the world. Graham proposed a ban on Muslims entering the U.S. in July 2015, months before Trump did the same.Graham has also suggested that allowing LGBTQ people into churches or Christian homes is allowing the “enemy,” or Satan, to “devour our homes.” Graham praised Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2014 for protecting Russian children from the “damaging effects of any gay and lesbian agenda.” Graham is the president and CEO of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, a missions-driven Christian nonprofit founded by his father. Through the BGEA, Graham has teamed up with local churches to hold “festivals” throughout the world to convert people to Christianity and engage local Christian communities.A representative for the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association declined to comment on the controversy surrounding Graham’s Blackpool festival or respond to questions about his rhetoric on Muslims and queer people.Instead, the representative told HuffPost that the festival “will be a positive and encouraging event with music and a message from Franklin Graham about the hope that can be found through a relationship with Jesus Christ.” Graham is also the president and CEO of Samaritan’s Purse, a Christian relief organization that provides aid to victims of war, disease and disaster around the world, including in Muslim-majority countries like Iraq.The pastor has maintained a close relationship with Trump, and was among several faith leaders chosen to read Bible passages at the presidential inauguration in January.Graham’s political views have created controversies for his festivals in the past. Before a festival in Vancouver in February, more than 30 Canadian Christian leaders issued a letter publicly criticizing Graham for making “disparaging and uncharitable remarks about Muslims and LGBTQ+ community.” Vancouver’s mayor also asked him to stay away. In response to the letter, Graham said Muslims and queer people were welcome to attend, and added that he was thankful the controversy would help “get the word out” and boost attendance. In the end, the BGEA of Canada claimed more than 34,000 people attended the festival."

A Justice Department attorney will argue against them. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a2b285c1900004d2c0355de.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Kids across America would be smart to send their good vibes to California this weekend. More specifically, they should focus on San Francisco and even more specifically on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.While that may be a strange place for kids to think about, the quality of their lives in the years ahead is hanging in the balance. Another bunch of kids and young adults will battle a lawyer from the federal government in front of the Court’s three-judge panel Monday to argue that President Trump must do something about global climate change. The kids went to court because young people, present and future, will suffer most from the dangerous impacts of global warming, much worse than the wildfires, floods, hurricanes, droughts and rising seas we see today.The stakes are big. In their lawsuit, Juliana v. United States, the youngsters charge that the government is contributing to climate change by doing things like allowing coal and oil to be produced on public lands. They argue that a climate system capable of sustaining human life must be protected by the government as a public trust. But their most important argument – one that could take their case all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court – is that the federal government’s failure to do enough about global warming will damage the planet so profoundly that it violates children’s constitutional rights to life and liberty.Based on those arguments, lower courts have allowed the case to proceed. A trial against the government is scheduled for next February, but President Trump and his Administration want to keep it from taking place.The kids filed their lawsuit when Barack Obama was president, even though he was doing more than any previous president stop global warming. President Donald Trump does not even believe that global warming is a problem, if it’s real at all, and he has been undoing all the climate-action initiatives President Obama put in place. That makes the lawsuit even more important and the federal government even more culpable.The Trump Administration clearly is worried. The department is sending one of its high-ranking lawyers to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to argue against the kids. In addition, Justice Department officials reportedly have been rounding up scientists who are willing to argue that climate science is still unsettled and that no immediate government action is necessary.Climate science has been in court before. When he was president, George W. Bush also wanted to ignore the seriousness of climate change. His Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) decided that CO2, the gas most responsible for the planet’s warming, is not a pollutant that could be regulated under the Clean Air Act. Twelve states and several cities disagreed and took EPA to court.The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that if the Administrator of EPA certified that CO2 does in fact endanger public health and safety, the gas should be regulated. After President Obama was elected, his new EPA evaluated more than 100 published scientific studies and the work of hundreds of scientists. It concluded that carbon gas emissions are indeed a danger to the public health and welfare of this and future generations.Now the latest legal battle is grinding slowly through the courts while sea levels rise, floods set records, wildfires turn entire neighborhoods to ash, and more violent hurricanes demolish our ocean-side and island communities. We hear again and again from the victims that disasters like this have never happened before.Justice is supposed to be blind, but not the president of the United States. We should expect the leaders we elect to help protect us against risks so large and consequential that individual citizens cannot avoid them by themselves. If the kids’ case goes to trial and the trial goes well, it could finally force President Trump to accept that by failing to take strong and immediate action to slow down climate change, he is not only violating the law; he is violating his moral duty to make sure that today’s kids, and tomorrow’s, will not have to live in times far more dangerous than they already are today."

But recently announced plans for an LGBTQ “headquarters and hangout” in San Francisco are having the opposite effect.

Benefits of membership include access to “hangout spots” and “get togethers,” as well as “library workspaces,” according to the club’s official website. “Bars, clubs, and apps can be a sugar rush. We love them too, but sometimes we’re looking for more,” Yass’ site reads. “Imagine instead, walking into a room filled with the queer role models you never had. Yass is this space.” News of the club’s opening quickly rankled a number of local LGBTQ advocates. Many say they are angered by the club’s apparent ties to PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, who is an outspoken supporter of President Donald Trump. Thiel, who is openly gay, donated $1.25 million to Trump’s election campaign, and praised the president as “very good on gay rights” in a January interview with The New York Times. The 50-year-old also reportedly bankrolled Hulk Hogan’s invasion of privacy lawsuit against Gawker. (The now-defunct website settled with Hogan to the tune of $31 million.) At present, a venture capital firm that the tech billionaire co-founded is the sole investor behind Yass, The Guardian reports.Among those to blast the club’s connection to Thiel was David Campos, a former election supervisor who represented the Mission District and who is openly gay. Acknowledging that San Francisco’s LGBTQ community “needs a space,” he specified, “We don’t need a space that is tainted by the hate of Donald Trump.”“This is a president who has tried to disenfranchise members of the LGBT community,” Campos told The Guardian in a Thursday interview. “When a gay man essentially becomes a tool of someone who is prosecuting people, that gay man needs to be called out.”Other LGBTQ rights advocates and allies were similarly incensed by the news. Yass’s founder and CEO Brian Tran downplayed the club’s connection to Thiel, telling The Guardian that his primary commitment was to “serving the queer community and their needs.” Though Tran acknowledged that Thiel was a “controversial figure” for LGBTQ people, he said, “I don’t know what his real intentions are, and it’s hard to make a judgment.” “Undeniably, he has made a huge impact in our economy,” he added.

Critics of Pai’s move to dismantle the regulations have accused him of being in Verizon’s pocket.On Thursday, net neutrality advocates protested outside Verizon stores nationwide. (Verizon owns HuffPost’s parent company, Oath. HuffPost’s union is represented by the Writers Guild of America, East, which supports net neutrality.)Given the sheer volume of public backlash Pai has received for attempting to undo net neutrality, you’d think he’d choose to roast himself in a different manner.A tipster sent Gizmodo a lengthy recording of Pai’s speech at Thursday’s gathering ― and it is awkward.About 20 minutes into the recording, Pai says: “In collusion — I mean, in conclusion, sorry, Freudian slip, my bad — many people are still shell-shocked that I’m up here tonight. They ask themselves, how on earth did this happen?”He also joked that a “leaked, 14-year-old video” reveals how he became FCC chairman. The subsequent video-within-a-video features a skit that is supposed to take place in 2003 at “Verizon’s DC Office” when Pai worked there. A woman walks in the room and pitches an idea to Pai. “As you know, the FCC is captured by the industry, but we think it’s not captured enough, so we have a plan,” she says.“What plan? What did you have in mind” Pai asks.“We want to brainwash and groom a Verizon puppet to install as FCC chairman,” she says. “Think ‘Manchurian Candidate.’”“That sounds awesome,” says Pai.The woman adds that the idea will take 14 years to incubate, suggesting that this is why Pai is now FCC chairman.The video is accompanied by an image of President Donald Trump and the theme song from “The Apprentice.” Some may find it icky and uncomfortable, but you can watch the footage here and decide for yourself."

18,POLITICS,DNC Unity Commission Agrees On Slate Of Historic Reforms,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dnc-unity-reform-commission-2016-presidential-primary_us_5a2c59fbe4b0a290f05145d2,The Democratic Party comes one step closer to healing the wounds of the 2016 primary.,2017-12-09,Tom Perez was elected chairman of the Democratic National Committee in February amid uncertainty about the party's commitment to restoring the trust of its progressive base.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a2c5b671900002500cca575.jpeg?cache=a7OgdZipE9&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― At its final meeting on Friday and Saturday, the Democratic National Committee’s Unity and Reform Commission agreed to a set of dramatic revisions aimed at restoring faith in the presidential nomination process and the management of the DNC.The 21-member panel, which held its ultimate gathering in a conference room at the Marriott Wardman Park in Washington, D.C., is recommending the effective abolition of some 60 percent of superdelegates to the presidential nominating convention. It has also presented a set of measures designed to increase accessibility to presidential primaries and caucuses, as well as reforms aimed at opening up DNC budgetary and administrative processes to greater scrutiny through, among other things, the creation of an Ombudsmen Council.The reforms are not yet a done deal, however. The commission’s report now heads to the DNC’s Rules and Bylaws Committee, which will have a 6-month period to amend party rules to enact the reforms, and could theoretically try to dilute the commission’s recommendations (though they would have to run any changes by the commission). The roster of over 400 voting DNC members will also get to vote on the proposals at the full DNC meeting in the fall of 2018. But the commission’s most adamant reformers, most of whom were appointed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), characterized the outcome as a major win for the Democratic Party’s disillusioned progressive wing. The acceptance of Sanders surrogates was essential to the commission’s success, since evidence that the DNC had favored Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential primary and the anger it inspired among Sanders supporters fueled the creation of the commission.“I hope that the grassroots [activists] who have felt dismissed and who have lost faith in the party ... understand that they have had warriors on this commission who are completely in line with their values and that we fought and we won a lot to make this party inclusive,” said Nomiki Konst, a Sanders appointee to the commission.Asked what his message would be for the hardened cynics on the grassroots left, Jim Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute, and another Sanders pick on the commission, declared that he too “went into [the commission] a hardened cynic ― as late as yesterday.”“I was convinced we weren’t gonna win anything,” he continued. “Overnight there was a sense that we had to come to closure on these, and people were willing to step forward on all of them.”Clinton-backing delegates to the Democratic National Convention in July agreed to the Unity and Reform Commission’s creation in July 2016. It was a compromise gesture to Sanders supporters who had attempted to force the abolition of all superdelegates in a pre-convention meeting of the convention’s rules committee.The commission, the agreement specified, would be composed of 21 members: 8 chosen by Sanders; 10 by Clinton; and 3 by the new DNC chair.When former Labor Secretary Tom Perez was elected DNC chair in February, relying almost exclusively on the backing of Clinton supporters, reformers wondered whether the party was really willing to address their concerns. And in April, when Perez announced both his and the Clinton campaign’s appointees to the commission, he did not make clear which members were Clinton’s picks and which were his, fueling some people’s skepticism of the commission’s makeup.But Sanders’ appointees, which included nationally-recognized loyalists like Our Revolution president Nina Turner, used their public platforms to punch above their numerical weight and keep grassroots pressure on the panel to enact major changes.And in early November, former interim DNC chair Donna Brazile rocked the political world with a tell-all book about her brief tenure as party leader that revealed the degree to which a cash-strapped DNC had allowed itself to be co-opted by the Clinton campaign. Long before the primary between Clinton and Sanders had ended, the Clinton campaign had won a final say over key DNC decisions, including the hiring of major personnel, according to Brazile.DNC chair Perez and others disputed some of Brazile’s characterizations, noting that Sanders had access to at least some of the joint-fundraising arrangements Clinton enjoyed. (Former Sanders staffers argued in turn that they were offered nothing that even resembled what Clinton got.)But in a statement to DNC staff, Perez also reiterated his commitment to following through on the Unity and Reform Commission’s recommendations. And in an op-ed this week with deputy DNC chair Keith Ellison, a Minnesota congressman and Sanders acolyte who narrowly lost to Perez in a close race for the chairmanship, Perez went further, promising additional reforms like a transparent presidential primary debate schedule.“Donna Brazile’s leadership and her bravery in coming forward with a lot of the problems that people just wanted to gloss over … that definitely paved the way for reform,” said Jane Kleeb, Nebraska Democratic Party chairwoman and Sanders appointee to the commission. “I also think Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders both spoke to their sides and said ‘Move forward.’”If the Unity and Reform Commission’s recommendations are adopted by the DNC, as they are widely expected to be, the party’s presidential nominating process will be significantly different in 2020. The most identifiable change for ordinary politics watchers is likely to be the scaled back role of superdelegates. Superdelegates are Democratic elected officials and insiders, including DNC members, who are “unpledged,” meaning they are free to vote for a presidential candidate regardless of who primary and caucus voters in their state choose. There is no equivalent to superdelegates in the Republican Party, though critics claim that party incumbents have their own undemocratic ways of exercising influence over the presidential nomination process.Sanders backers lamented from the start of the 2016 primary that the decision of hundreds of superdelegates to endorse Clinton before Sanders had even entered the race had unfairly jaded the contest’s outcome. Wikileaks’ publication of hacked emails by DNC staffers in June 2016 appeared to validate Sanders partisans’ view that the DNC had at least favored Clinton. The Unity and Reform Commission members proposed binding all but the highest subset of superdelegates to the choice of Democratic voters in their state, resulting in a reduction of over 60 percent in the number of “unpledged” convention delegates.Former presidents, former vice presidents, former DNC chairs, as well as sitting members of Congress and sitting governors would retain their superdelegate privileges under the proposal.In a bid to increase participation in the presidential nominating process and welcome independents, the commission imposed a slew of new requirements on state parties that hold caucuses. Caucuses, party-administered processes that involve multiple ballots and a much larger time commitment, typically draw a much smaller crowd than primaries.The commission proposal would require state parties to allow voters to register for the first time or switch party affiliation on the same day of the caucus and submit absentee ballots by mail, as well as ensure the use of written ballots to confirm the accuracy of results. The DNC has less authority over primaries, which are run by state governments. But the commission has issued recommendations that presidential primaries adhere to the same new criteria, and holds out the possibility of penalties for state Democratic parties that do not do everything in their power to adopt those changes.Although it was not singled out explicitly, the case of New York, which is one of 11 states with closed primaries, weighed heavily on the minds of reformers on the commission. The state requires voters not registered with the Democratic Party to switch affiliations some six months before a party primary, and register for the first time as a Democrat nearly a month beforehand. The strict requirements, critics argue, protect incumbents and other established political figures at the expense of insurgents like Sanders who excite independents.The Unity and Reform Commission, which formally met on five occasions, was not without its turbulent moments. A key sticking point in the final meeting was how far the commission should go in recommending new accountability mechanisms for the party’s budget, including joint fundraising agreements and contracts with outside vendors and consultants. Progressive commissioners viewed greater budget transparency as essential, not merely because of what occurred during the 2016 primary, but because of years of fiscal opacity that skeptics argue led to disproportionate funds going to a handful of consulting firms and other expensive contractors.Zogby, who has been a voting DNC member for over a decade, was fond of reminding people that he had never once seen the DNC’s budget.On Friday, moderate members of the commission signaled that they would vote down a proposal to create an Ombudsmen Council to serve as a kind of inspector general and complaints board for the DNC, as well as provisions empowering the DNC’s Budget and Finance Committee to exercise greater oversight over financial decisions. They worried about depriving DNC staff of discretion over professional decisions, and argued that members of the Budget and Finance Committee needed to have appropriate financial expertise.In a key flashpoint that went viral in progressive circles, Nomiki Konst went on an impassioned rant against those who would stand in the way of greater budget transparency.“We spent a billion dollars [and] lost the easiest presidential race you could possibly imagine,” she declared. “How are you supposed to rebuild the party if you have no idea where that money was spent?”The commission tabled the proposals until Saturday. On Friday evening and into Saturday morning, commissioners crafted a compromise that ensured the concerns of various sides would be addressed. Konst and Zogby both credited Rep. Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio) and Maryland Democratic National Committeewoman Yvetter Lewis, both of whom were Clinton appointees, for helping bridge the divide.In the final recommendations, the commission proposed a 7-member Ombudsmen Council that included the elected chairs of the DNC’s 4 regional caucuses. The Budget and Finance Committee would also include elected DNC members, and all of its members would have to disclose their potential conflicts of interest. Any expenditure of over $100,000 a year to outside vendors or consultants would require committee approval. Its meetings would be open to any member of the DNC, as would the DNC’s budget materials.“There’s now checks and balances on finances, as well as when problems come up, you now have a place to go if you’re a DNC member to get those solutions,” Kleeb said.David Huynh, a Clinton appointee to the commissions who worked for Clinton’s campaign, said there was a “lot of give and take between the two sides.” “We can finally declare that the 2016 presidential nomination is over with,” he said.Not all progressive activists are happy with the outcome. Kurt Walters, campaign director of Demand Progress Action, an internet freedom group that spearheaded a Thursday letter from a number of left-leaning organizations admonishing the commission to recommend as sweeping reforms as possible, said in a statement that reducing the number of superdelegates, rather than eliminating all of them, was a “bare minimum step.”  “But it is also not a done deal,” Walters continued, referring to the need for the DNC’s Rules and Bylaws Committee and broader membership to accept the reforms. “The party’s grassroots base will continue to push through every part of this process for the complete end of the voting power of superdelegates. Groups will be watching closely for any sign of backsliding from today’s vote.”A coalition of left-leaning Democratic Party activists known as the Democratic Autopsy Task Force, which issued its own report on the party’s failings in November, was even more scathing. “The Unity Reform Commission meetings have been an exercise in modern smoke-filled back rooms without the smoke,” Karen Bernal, chair of the California Democratic Party’s Progressive Caucus said in a statement that focused on lack of communication about commission meetings, including incomplete information about the location of the final gathering. “With the added ‘party line vote’ of the commission members on proposed reforms ― the Clinton supporters numbering more than the Sanders supporters ― the outcomes overall have been unimpressive to say the least.”Lucy Flores, a former Nevada State Assemblywoman and Sanders commission appointee, praised the commission recommendations as a major accomplishment but welcomed the skepticism of diehard activists.“They absolutely should keep up that skepticism because that translates to accountability,” Flores said. “But they should keep an open mind and go into it the same way we did, with a good faith approach.”"

Despite President Donald Trump’s best efforts this year, that list seems to include the “War on Christmas.”Long before Christmas music hit the airwaves and Starbucks rolled out its red cups, Trump got a jump-start on the battle, pledging during a July speech that “we’re going to start staying ‘Merry Christmas’ again.” It’s a theme that he’s revisited since.“We are getting near the beautiful Christmas season that people don’t talk about anymore,” Trump said during a mid-October address to the Values Voter Summit. “They don’t use the word ‘Christmas.’”As recently as 2013, a slim majority of Americans indeed thought that the holiday was under attack, according to a YouGov poll. But now, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov survey asking the same question, just 34 percent think there’s any sort of war against Christmas ― making the concept less popular than Trump himself, and giving it only slightly more backing than the GOP’s new tax bill. (For the sake of complete data, we asked those who still thought there was a war whether Christmas was winning or losing. They said by a 15-point margin, 44 percent to 29 percent, that it was ahead.)It’s hard to have a war over something nobody cares enough to fight over. The vast majority of Americans are pretty much fine with whatever version of seasonal greetings you’d like to offer.Most people do have a preference ― 55 percent say they’d rather be wished a merry Christmas, and 11 percent prefer “happy holidays,” with the remainder unsure or having no preference. But only 11 percent of Americans say they’d be offended to hear a different greeting.While 29 percent of those who say “merry Christmas” think the phrase would offend people who prefer “happy holidays,” just 11 percent of those who say “happy holidays” say they actually would be offended. Only 19 percent of “merry Christmas” partisans would be offended to hear “happy holidays,” similar to the 22 percent of “happy holidays” wishers who anticipate that the phrase would cause offense.Even Trump’s base isn’t really biting. While 71 percent believe there’s a war on Christmas and 85 percent prefer to be wished a “merry Christmas,” fewer than a quarter say they’d be offended by a different greeting.Use the widget below to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Dec. 4-6 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

Steve King (R-Iowa) has again flirted with being an open white nationalist. In a tweet Friday, the congressman lashed out at multiculturalism.“Diversity is not our strength,” the congressman wrote, linking to an article on a deeply dubious anti-immigration website called Voice of Europe, which quotes Hungary’s far-right prime minister, Viktor Orban, as saying that “mixing cultures will not lead to a higher quality of life but a lower one.” But where have we heard this phrase before? Well, David Duke, the former KKK grand wizard and prominent American white supremacist, has used it when exploiting tragedies or acts of violence: Thomas Robb, current national director of the KKK, told Slate earlier this year that “diversity is not our strength. Diversity will kill us.” Here’s Robb at a cross-burning rally in Texas:Billy Roper, a prominent American neo-Nazi, wrote in his book “The Big Picture” that “Diversity is not our strength. Neither is being outnumbered and outgunned.” Here’s Roper at an Aryan Nations-sponsored White Heritage Days Festival in Alabama: Brad Griffin, also known as Hunter Wallace, a leader of a white nationalist group based in Alabama, tweeted “diversity ISN’T our strength” last month. Griffin organized a “White Lives Matter” rally in Tennessee recently, which featured neo-Confederate, southern secessionist, and neo-Nazi participants.In 2011, writer Peter Brimelow, the white nationalist behind the racist site VDARE, told CNN that “Diversity is not strength.” He uttered the phrase previously in 2004, while praising a book by conservative blogger Michelle Malkin that defended the mass incarceration of Japanese-Americans in concentration camps during World War II. The rationale for imprisoning thousands of people in the camps, he told The Denver Post, was “very straightforward. Racial profiling always makes sense. It’s just that, you know, diversity is not strength, it’s weakness. It’s impossible to discuss it honestly, though.”Here’s Brimelow at a recent conference of the National Policy Institute, the “think tank” of the so-called “alt-right,” a loose association of fascists and white supremacists. That’s him second from the left, in between his white nationalist pals Richard Spencer and Jared Taylor: And in 2007, Gordon Baum, co-founder and then-CEO of the racist group Council of Conservative Citizens (CCC) — whose website has referred to blacks as “a retrograde species of humanity” — told the Birmingham News that “diversity is not our strength, it is our calamity, our downfall.”“Diversity is not our strength” has been seen on white nationalist fliers in Pennsylvania. There’s also a whole thread called “Diversity is not our strength” on the popular white supremacist hate site Stormfront. And variations of the phrase appear most commonly today on alt-right Twitter accounts, often paired with cherry-picked news stories of non-white people committing crimes. Mark Pitcavage, senior research fellow at the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism, told HuffPost that the phrase isn’t a white supremacist slogan, “as much as it is an obvious thing for them to say.” It’s a response to hearing liberal politicians and academics praise diversity, he said. And the phrase isn’t the sole provenance of self-proclaimed white supremacists. There are hard-right figures and anti-immigration groups, some of them bordering on extremist, who have used the phrase. Co-founder of Vice Media, Gavin McInnes, the “Alt-Lite” figure and self-proclaimed “western chauvinist” founder of the Proud Boys has also used it. In a video posted earlier this year, he talks about how he thinks other countries’ food is yucky, and he really doesn’t like it! The video was titled “Diversity is NOT our strength (and shut up about restaurants).” And Michael Anton, the controversial White House aide selected by President Donald Trump to serve on the National Security Council, used the phrase last year in an essay in which he defended the America First Committee, a World War II-era isolationist group known for its anti-Semitism.“‘Diversity’ is not ‘our strength;’ it’s a source of weakness, tension and disunion,” Anton wrote. “America is not a ‘nation of immigrants’; we are originally a nation of settlers, who later chose to admit immigrants, and later still not to, and who may justly open or close our doors solely at our own discretion, without deference to forced pieties.”Pitcavage said it’s alarming to see an elected official like Rep. King make the statement. “It’s problematic, first of all because it suggests that diversity is a bad thing, which suggests that people should work to remove diversity,” Pitcavage said. “Not only does that speak against the whole American experiment, it sends a clear message to anybody who is not white or is in some way a minority or is not part of whatever selected pool Mr. King approves of.” “How are his constituents supposed to feel?” he continued. “He’s from Iowa. Iowa is not the most diverse state in the country, but there are people of different faiths and ethnicities and he’s supposed to represent them.” Heidi Beirich, director of the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Intelligence Project, which monitors hate groups, says she’s heard white supremacists say the “diversity is not our strength” expression since at least 1999, when she joined the SPLC. King, she said, “clearly is a racist who shares some views with white nationalists on things like immigrants for example.” King has a long history of signaling support of white nationalism. He keeps a Confederate flag on his desk, even though he is from Iowa, which was not part of the Confederacy. He has said America shouldn’t apologize for slavery. He has called putting emancipator Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill “racist” and “sexist.” He, of course, has indulged in birther beliefs, once suggesting President Barack Obama was born in Kenya. Racial profiling in Ferguson, Missouri, during protests over the police shooting of Michael Brown, King once said, was not an issue because all the protesters were of the same “continental origin.” He has argued that most undocumented immigrants are “drug mules.” “For every [undocumented immigrant] who’s a valedictorian, there’s another 100 out there who weigh 130 pounds—and they’ve got calves the size of cantaloupes because they’re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert,” he said. He once tweeted a photo of himself standing with Geert Wilders, the rabidly Islamophobic far-right Dutch politician, with the caption: “Cultural suicide by demographic transformation must end.” And in March of this year, King tweeted “Wilders understands that culture and demographics are our destiny. We can’t restore our civilization with somebody else’s babies.” This prompted gushing praise from white nationalists. “Steve King is basically an open white nationalist at this point,” Andrew Anglin wrote on his popular white supremacist site, The Daily Stormer. “OUR civilization and SOMEBODY ELSE’S babies. Not really any nuance there,” Anglin wrote. “Steve King should be Speaker of the House. Period. There [sic] is as plain as the nose on your face.

We can only hope these kinds of statements serve to embolden more of our people, as they see that people like themselves are in positions of power.” And David Duke, the former KKK leader, called for King to succeed Trump as president in 2024 to “finish the job.” King’s office did not immediately respond to a HuffPost inquiry Saturday as to whether he considers himself a white nationalist.

The New York Times weighed in with a new data analysis on Friday. The newspaper said it reviewed the daily mortality data from the Demographic Registry of Puerto Rico and found that 1,052 more people than usual died on the island during the 42 days after the hurricane devastated the U.S. territory on Sept. 20. The Puerto Rican government’s official death count stands at 62. The Times said it calculated the figure by comparing the number of deaths for each day in 2017 with the average number of deaths on the same day in 2015 and 2016. The report noted that data for October has yet to be completed, with the island’s lack of power delaying record-keeping, and that the number of deaths in that month is expected to increase. “Before the hurricane, I had an average of 82 deaths daily. That changes from Sept. 20 to 30th. Now I have an average of 118 deaths daily,” the director of the Demographic Registry in Puerto Rico, Wanda Llovet, told the Times in mid-November. She told the newspaper this week that both figures have risen by one."

It has stockpiled thousands of ready-to-launch missiles, tens of thousands of bombs, uncounted reserves of small arms, hundreds of tanks and fighter jets and some of the most aggressive spyware available in the world. Through Saudi Arabia’s supply lines to Asia and its sway over the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, it wields vast power over the oil production that fuels global trade. And its population of nearly 30 million is largely young and often vulnerable to terrorist recruitment, as striking levels of volunteering and fundraising for the self-described Islamic State and al Qaeda have shown. Despite the risks, Mohammed bin Salman, the 32-year-old Saudi king-to-be, has spent close to three years pushing the kingdom to change in unprecedented ways — to forcefully intervene abroad, as it has to brutal effect in neighboring Yemen, to open up its state-dominated economy to entrepreneurs and foreign capital, and above all, to embrace rule by one near-omnipotent leader. The crown prince is likely to see at least some success. But officials and experts monitoring the kingdom are increasingly worried about his methods. If Mohammed bin Salman pushes too hard, he could shatter his society ― and unleash a nightmare.Since Nov. 4, the prince has accelerated his campaign. His new anti-corruption agency has arrested hundreds of prominent Saudis ― including royal family members like recently released Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, the son of the previous king and former head of the powerful National Guard, and noted billionaire investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal ― as well as dozens of military officers and private businessmen like construction magnate Bakr Binladin. At least 17 detainees have needed medical attention because of abuse, according to The New York Times, and Saudi authorities say they seek to confiscate much of the wealth these figures accumulated — securing hundreds of billions of dollars to fund Mohammed bin Salman’s agenda.The prince is aware of international anxiety about Saudi stability. In interviews with important Westerners like Thomas Friedman of The New York Times, he suggests that he shares that concern. Mohammed bin Salman’s argument is that collapse would be likely ― even inevitable ― without his plans. He cites goals reformist Saudis and outsiders have long said Riyadh must adopt: ending endemic corruption, encouraging Saudis to be less dependent on the state with his Vision 2030 economic strategy, and discouraging ultra-conservative interpretations of Islam. “Changing Saudi Arabia for the better means helping the region and changing the world. So this is what we are trying to do here. And we hope we get support from everyone,” the prince told The Guardian in October.But he’s also fundamentally changing the methods his country has relied on to avert catastrophe. “The [Saudi] system itself is in many ways built around trying to ensure stability,” Derek Chollet, who has served in top positions at the White House, Pentagon and State Department since the 1990s, told HuffPost.Consider the last time Saudi Arabia had a hostile army on its borders. It didn’t announce a response for six days.“You had King Fahd, but you had Crown Prince Abdullah, the head of the National Guard; Prince Sultan, the head of the defense ministry; Prince Nayef, head of the interior ministry; and Prince Saud Al-Faisal at the foreign ministry,” said F. Gregory Gause, an expert on the Persian Gulf at Texas A&M University. “These were all senior members of the family. They all had a voice in what went on,” Gause continued, adding, “the king had to, if not get a consensus, at least consult around with various people. So if we look at 1990, which is relatively well-documented from the American side, we know that the Saudis for days didn’t acknowledge that the Iraqis had invaded Kuwait because they hadn’t come to a decision on how to handle it.”That consensus-based system — which King Salman, the crown prince’s father, once described to American interviewer Karen Elliott House as Saudi Arabia’s answer to democracy — dominated the kingdom’s politics for decades. Saudi Arabians do not choose representatives who can truly influence the policies of their king. Saudi courts have little judicial independence. And the regime’s domestic critics have never wielded real power. Sons of the founder of the modern Saudi state, including King Salman, have ruled in succession since 1953, and various brothers, sons and cousins have developed independent power centers by running various aspects of the sprawling government. The chief checks and balances on any rulers of the kingdom were traditionally within the top tier of the thousands-strong royal family. With last month’s arrests, Mohammed bin Salman signaled that the old system is dead. The prince had already slashed the power of the kingdom’s religious establishment, the one institution in the country that can claim as central a role in Saudi history as the royal family, and jailed more than 30 clerics, intellectuals and activists. Now high-ranking sources in the kingdom say they are afraid of growing surveillance. The prince has consolidated power in a way unknown to the kingdom since the the age of his grandfather in the 1930s and ’40s. Experts say his goal is to show the only way to thrive in Saudi Arabia is to be loyal to his agenda and to him personally. But it’s unclear what comes next, and why there should be any confidence that it will work. “If you think you can change Saudi society without the religious types enthusiastically behind you, without the rich people supporting you and by marginalizing this huge network of regime support that the ruling family represented, that’s a risky path,” Gause, the Texas A&M professor, told HuffPost.The Saudi government’s response to those doubts is firm: We know what we’re doing.“The pace of change has changed due to the young and dynamic leadership in addition to the young and educated population,” Fatimah Baeshen, the spokeswoman for the Saudi Embassy in Washington, told HuffPost in a recent email.“Vision 2030 set long-term aims and also creates a platform for everyone to contribute, both of which ensure the country’s sustainability,” she added. “There is a symbiotic relationship between public sentiment and ongoing public discourse which informs policy development. This helps set the pace and ensures stability.”Mohammed bin Salman can rely on significant support. His anti-corruption rhetoric resonates with millions of Saudis who feel that the elite have fleeced state oil revenues, as well as with businesspeople around the world who are frustrated with unaccountable Saudi partners. “It would be a mistake to dismiss all authoritarian efforts to clean up government as little more than ‘political theater,’” analysts Andrew Leber and Christopher Carothers wrote of the crackdown in Saudi Arabia, suggesting it might lead to long-lasting and positive reforms. The prince’s decision to allow Saudi women to drive and to defang the kingdom’s long-feared religious police will likely also pay dividends. “He gets lots of people because of these cards, [like the] social liberalism card,” said Hala Aldosari, a Saudi rights activist and current fellow at Harvard’s Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. “For Saudis, this is a gain, even if it means this is a gain being made for political reasons, to present himself as the visionary leader more appropriate for relations with the West.” Mohammed bin Salman’s approach of strategically reducing global oil supplies (and even Saudi market share) to keep prices high recently helped boost Saudi foreign reserves for the first time in months, and there are high expectations for the anticipated payouts to the treasury, courtesy of his anti-corruption drive and the income Riyadh can gain from publicly listing part of its state-owned oil company. The same month as the crackdown, Saudi Arabia’s non-oil private sector grew at its quickest pace in two years, a recent economic survey showed.But blunders are inevitable. The question is how big they’ll be.One possibility is that the prince won’t be able to pull off most of the change he’s gunning for, will decide that it’s impossible, and will fall into old, self-destructive Saudi habits. There are already signs he will have to slow-roll attempted cuts to public benefits.To Aldosari, a former government consultant, Mohammed bin Salman’s challenges to the old system don’t even seem as sweeping as many have suggested. “It’s not a change of structure, it’s a change of approach: how to distribute power,” she told HuffPost. She envisages the prince setting up his own new (if smaller) club of inevitably corrupt elites to replace the old guard, and believes he’ll ultimately be seen as more personally linked to Saudi government policy than previous kings ― and therefore, more likely to be blamed when things go wrong. Saudis have blasted Mohamad bin Salman’s response to recent floods in Jeddah, the kingdom’s second-largest city, noting that he’d promised accountability measures that would force corrupt officials to actually spend government money on infrastructure to prevent such flooding.His anti-corruption credentials have also suffered because of The Wall Street Journal’s revelation that he spent close to half a billion dollars on a Leonardo da Vinci painting in October. It remains unclear how much money he and his branch of the royal family have made over the years.If Mohammed bin Salman chooses to mostly follow the path of previous kings, simply modifying it to accommodate his desire to have more personal control, the system could become even more repressive, Aldosari said, with the human rights community losing one potential check on the king’s prerogative. In the past, she explained, royals with influence sometimes intervened on activists’ behalf, as Prince Alwaleed did when he urged lighter prison sentences for women arrested for challenging the driving restrictions.An even darker future may come to pass if Mohammed bin Salman’s plans backfire dramatically. The lack of due process in the targeting of notable Saudis has already spooked the international investors he’s hoping to court and the powerful figures at home who are now exploring ways to protect their assets because they think they might be next. There’s a chance the decisive boom in non-oil Saudi business he’s waiting for just won’t come ― and the country will be left with shrunken government reserves from his surrendering of Saudi market share in the oil trade, as well as a population angry about failed promises and slashed benefits. Unlike previous Saudi monarchs, Mohammed bin Salman also won’t be able to rely on a system historically proven to manage dissent when he is king. He’s scared off potential challengers for now, but experts believe anger might linger, particularly in agencies like the interior ministry that have long been controlled by branches of the royal family that he has sidelined. That resentment could fuel private scheming to thwart the king-to-be, perhaps after he loses his father’s protection and lays his own claim to the throne. It could even inspire direct assaults, like the assassination attempt that claimed King Faisal’s life in 1975, or the violent takeover of the holy complex in Mecca in 1979 by ultraconservative militants. Wealthy Saudis have long been willing to fund men with guns ― including extremists, as in the cases of al Qaeda and ISIS, which have both pledged to overthrow the Saudi regime. It’s not hard to imagine some turning to that tactic again, perhaps even boosting internal pockets of resistance like the persecuted Shiite community in the oil-rich Eastern Province. A Saudi civil war would be a brutal affair ― one directly implicating and endangering the West, given how much American and European weaponry is in the kingdom and how Middle East security vacuums have proven to shelter militants planning attacks thousands of miles away.Internal fissures could also lead Mohammed bin Salman to wreak havoc beyond the kingdom’s borders. His efforts against regional rival Iran have already brought millions to the brink of famine in Yemen and proven “haphazard, unsettling and counterproductive,” according to International Institute for Strategic Studies analyst Emile Hokayem. The bitterness he’s inspired among traditionally Saudi-friendly Sunni Muslims in Lebanon by forcing the televised humiliation of their leader ― in Saudi Arabia, no less ― is a potent example. But using foreign interventions to stoke Saudi nationalism is one of the prince’s favored tactics to shore up support, Aldosari told HuffPost. The kingdom may embark on more messy, internationally condemned adventures abroad ― and it’s unclear how they will end. Well-connected former CIA official Bruce Riedel recently told a Washington audience that the prince’s foreign policy has failed to account for any way out of the crises he has created so far.The widely held view among observers of the region, including some fierce critics of the kingdom and the prince, is that it would be best for the kingdom and the world if Mohammed bin Salman’s big gamble were to work out.The expectation of relative stability has been part of the foundation of U.S.-Saudi relations, analysts Michael Stephens and Thomas Juneau wrote in 2016. Chollet, the former U.S. official now at the German Marshall Fund think tank, told HuffPost he recalled anxiety among Obama aides in 2011 and 2012 when then-King Abdullah’s health began to falter and it appeared that the Saudi succession might become problematic. He counts himself as one of many in Washington rooting for Mohammed bin Salman to succeed, but unsure if he can.When Riyadh errs, Chollet said, Washington has some leverage to spur better judgment, but sometimes not enough. And under President Donald Trump, who has loudly praised Mohammed bin Salman’s purges and whose son-in-law Jared Kushner is enamored with the prince, even limited cautioning seems unlikely. A U.S. official working on the region recently described the White House as unwilling to hear criticism of Mohammed bin Salman’s choices, and said the only prospect of a change is if the famously fickle U.S. president one day simply changes his mind on his own. “In many ways, [Trump and the Saudi royals] feel very familiar to one another,” Chollet said, joking, “They have the same interior decorator.” Some seasoned Saudi watchers say the young king-in-waiting is adjusting course. Official Washington was very pleased with a report last month from Washington Post grandee David Ignatius that suggested Mohammed bin Salman seeks calm resolutions to his November surprises ― the corruption arrests and the Lebanese prime minister’s since-reversed resignation announcement ― by settling with detainees out of court and reiterating Saudi support for the U.S.-backed national army of Lebanon. But there’s still anxiety in the air.“Regime stability is an enduring concern,” Chollet said. “Instability in Saudi Arabia does not stay in Saudi Arabia.”"
25,POLITICS,Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Is Pushing His Country To The Brink. Will It Hold Together?,Akbar Shahid Ahmed,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/saudi-arabia-crown-prince_us_5a1dca8ae4b04abdc6147caa,"The nightmare scenario is the loud, messy collapse of a society full of weapons, money, frustrated young people and extremist tendencies.",2017-12-09,"A five-year-old girl sits on a scale at a malnutrition treatment center in Sanaa, Yemen, on Nov. 22, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a1dcd73140000000eb6a429.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Saudi Arabia in free fall would make the other crises in the Middle East look puny.The hugely wealthy kingdom is key to U.S. efforts to combat America’s most urgent threats. It has stockpiled thousands of ready-to-launch missiles, tens of thousands of bombs, uncounted reserves of small arms, hundreds of tanks and fighter jets and some of the most aggressive spyware available in the world. Through Saudi Arabia’s supply lines to Asia and its sway over the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, it wields vast power over the oil production that fuels global trade. And its population of nearly 30 million is largely young and often vulnerable to terrorist recruitment, as striking levels of volunteering and fundraising for the self-described Islamic State and al Qaeda have shown. Despite the risks, Mohammed bin Salman, the 32-year-old Saudi king-to-be, has spent close to three years pushing the kingdom to change in unprecedented ways — to forcefully intervene abroad, as it has to brutal effect in neighboring Yemen, to open up its state-dominated economy to entrepreneurs and foreign capital, and above all, to embrace rule by one near-omnipotent leader. The crown prince is likely to see at least some success. But officials and experts monitoring the kingdom are increasingly worried about his methods. If Mohammed bin Salman pushes too hard, he could shatter his society ― and unleash a nightmare.Since Nov. 4, the prince has accelerated his campaign. His new anti-corruption agency has arrested hundreds of prominent Saudis ― including royal family members like recently released Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, the son of the previous king and former head of the powerful National Guard, and noted billionaire investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal ― as well as dozens of military officers and private businessmen like construction magnate Bakr Binladin. At least 17 detainees have needed medical attention because of abuse, according to The New York Times, and Saudi authorities say they seek to confiscate much of the wealth these figures accumulated — securing hundreds of billions of dollars to fund Mohammed bin Salman’s agenda.The prince is aware of international anxiety about Saudi stability. In interviews with important Westerners like Thomas Friedman of The New York Times, he suggests that he shares that concern. Mohammed bin Salman’s argument is that collapse would be likely ― even inevitable ― without his plans. He cites goals reformist Saudis and outsiders have long said Riyadh must adopt: ending endemic corruption, encouraging Saudis to be less dependent on the state with his Vision 2030 economic strategy, and discouraging ultra-conservative interpretations of Islam. “Changing Saudi Arabia for the better means helping the region and changing the world. So this is what we are trying to do here. And we hope we get support from everyone,” the prince told The Guardian in October.But he’s also fundamentally changing the methods his country has relied on to avert catastrophe. “The [Saudi] system itself is in many ways built around trying to ensure stability,” Derek Chollet, who has served in top positions at the White House, Pentagon and State Department since the 1990s, told HuffPost.Consider the last time Saudi Arabia had a hostile army on its borders. It didn’t announce a response for six days.“You had King Fahd, but you had Crown Prince Abdullah, the head of the National Guard; Prince Sultan, the head of the defense ministry; Prince Nayef, head of the interior ministry; and Prince Saud Al-Faisal at the foreign ministry,” said F. Gregory Gause, an expert on the Persian Gulf at Texas A&M University. “These were all senior members of the family. They all had a voice in what went on,” Gause continued, adding, “the king had to, if not get a consensus, at least consult around with various people. So if we look at 1990, which is relatively well-documented from the American side, we know that the Saudis for days didn’t acknowledge that the Iraqis had invaded Kuwait because they hadn’t come to a decision on how to handle it.”That consensus-based system — which King Salman, the crown prince’s father, once described to American interviewer Karen Elliott House as Saudi Arabia’s answer to democracy — dominated the kingdom’s politics for decades. Saudi Arabians do not choose representatives who can truly influence the policies of their king. Saudi courts have little judicial independence. And the regime’s domestic critics have never wielded real power. Sons of the founder of the modern Saudi state, including King Salman, have ruled in succession since 1953, and various brothers, sons and cousins have developed independent power centers by running various aspects of the sprawling government. The chief checks and balances on any rulers of the kingdom were traditionally within the top tier of the thousands-strong royal family. With last month’s arrests, Mohammed bin Salman signaled that the old system is dead. The prince had already slashed the power of the kingdom’s religious establishment, the one institution in the country that can claim as central a role in Saudi history as the royal family, and jailed more than 30 clerics, intellectuals and activists. Now high-ranking sources in the kingdom say they are afraid of growing surveillance. The prince has consolidated power in a way unknown to the kingdom since the the age of his grandfather in the 1930s and ’40s. Experts say his goal is to show the only way to thrive in Saudi Arabia is to be loyal to his agenda and to him personally. But it’s unclear what comes next, and why there should be any confidence that it will work. “If you think you can change Saudi society without the religious types enthusiastically behind you, without the rich people supporting you and by marginalizing this huge network of regime support that the ruling family represented, that’s a risky path,” Gause, the Texas A&M professor, told HuffPost.The Saudi government’s response to those doubts is firm: We know what we’re doing.“The pace of change has changed due to the young and dynamic leadership in addition to the young and educated population,” Fatimah Baeshen, the spokeswoman for the Saudi Embassy in Washington, told HuffPost in a recent email.“Vision 2030 set long-term aims and also creates a platform for everyone to contribute, both of which ensure the country’s sustainability,” she added. “There is a symbiotic relationship between public sentiment and ongoing public discourse which informs policy development. This helps set the pace and ensures stability.”Mohammed bin Salman can rely on significant support. His anti-corruption rhetoric resonates with millions of Saudis who feel that the elite have fleeced state oil revenues, as well as with businesspeople around the world who are frustrated with unaccountable Saudi partners. “It would be a mistake to dismiss all authoritarian efforts to clean up government as little more than ‘political theater,’” analysts Andrew Leber and Christopher Carothers wrote of the crackdown in Saudi Arabia, suggesting it might lead to long-lasting and positive reforms. The prince’s decision to allow Saudi women to drive and to defang the kingdom’s long-feared religious police will likely also pay dividends. “He gets lots of people because of these cards, [like the] social liberalism card,” said Hala Aldosari, a Saudi rights activist and current fellow at Harvard’s Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. “For Saudis, this is a gain, even if it means this is a gain being made for political reasons, to present himself as the visionary leader more appropriate for relations with the West.” Mohammed bin Salman’s approach of strategically reducing global oil supplies (and even Saudi market share) to keep prices high recently helped boost Saudi foreign reserves for the first time in months, and there are high expectations for the anticipated payouts to the treasury, courtesy of his anti-corruption drive and the income Riyadh can gain from publicly listing part of its state-owned oil company. The same month as the crackdown, Saudi Arabia’s non-oil private sector grew at its quickest pace in two years, a recent economic survey showed.But blunders are inevitable. The question is how big they’ll be.One possibility is that the prince won’t be able to pull off most of the change he’s gunning for, will decide that it’s impossible, and will fall into old, self-destructive Saudi habits. There are already signs he will have to slow-roll attempted cuts to public benefits.To Aldosari, a former government consultant, Mohammed bin Salman’s challenges to the old system don’t even seem as sweeping as many have suggested. “It’s not a change of structure, it’s a change of approach: how to distribute power,” she told HuffPost. She envisages the prince setting up his own new (if smaller) club of inevitably corrupt elites to replace the old guard, and believes he’ll ultimately be seen as more personally linked to Saudi government policy than previous kings ― and therefore, more likely to be blamed when things go wrong. Saudis have blasted Mohamad bin Salman’s response to recent floods in Jeddah, the kingdom’s second-largest city, noting that he’d promised accountability measures that would force corrupt officials to actually spend government money on infrastructure to prevent such flooding.His anti-corruption credentials have also suffered because of The Wall Street Journal’s revelation that he spent close to half a billion dollars on a Leonardo da Vinci painting in October. It remains unclear how much money he and his branch of the royal family have made over the years.If Mohammed bin Salman chooses to mostly follow the path of previous kings, simply modifying it to accommodate his desire to have more personal control, the system could become even more repressive, Aldosari said, with the human rights community losing one potential check on the king’s prerogative. In the past, she explained, royals with influence sometimes intervened on activists’ behalf, as Prince Alwaleed did when he urged lighter prison sentences for women arrested for challenging the driving restrictions.An even darker future may come to pass if Mohammed bin Salman’s plans backfire dramatically. The lack of due process in the targeting of notable Saudis has already spooked the international investors he’s hoping to court and the powerful figures at home who are now exploring ways to protect their assets because they think they might be next. There’s a chance the decisive boom in non-oil Saudi business he’s waiting for just won’t come ― and the country will be left with shrunken government reserves from his surrendering of Saudi market share in the oil trade, as well as a population angry about failed promises and slashed benefits. Unlike previous Saudi monarchs, Mohammed bin Salman also won’t be able to rely on a system historically proven to manage dissent when he is king. He’s scared off potential challengers for now, but experts believe anger might linger, particularly in agencies like the interior ministry that have long been controlled by branches of the royal family that he has sidelined. That resentment could fuel private scheming to thwart the king-to-be, perhaps after he loses his father’s protection and lays his own claim to the throne. It could even inspire direct assaults, like the assassination attempt that claimed King Faisal’s life in 1975, or the violent takeover of the holy complex in Mecca in 1979 by ultraconservative militants.

26,GREEN,Montreal Is Ending Its Ban On Pit Bulls,Hilary Hanson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/montreal-pit-bull-ban_us_5a2c233de4b073789f6a4a20,"″​Montreal is a welcoming city for pet owners and will remain so,” said a city official.",2017-12-09,Montreal is set to lift restrictions on pit bull adoption and ownership.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a2c5848190000492c03571d.jpeg?cache=CPOEo1r8al&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Montreal will roll back a ban on pit bull-type dogs after animal protection groups slammed the measure.Valérie Plante, who was elected mayor of the Canadian city in November, promised during her campaign that she would repeal breed-specific restrictions on dog ownership that had been put into place by former Mayor Denis Coderre.On Friday, Craig Sauvé, a city councilor who serves on a committee that handles animal control, announced that animal control bylaws that target specific dog breeds or physical characteristics — rather than demonstrated behavior — will be officially lifted at a Dec. 20 meeting.“Montreal is a welcoming city for pet owners and will remain so,” Sauvé said, according to the CBC.In 2016, Coderre’s government passed legislation that banned Montreal residents from acquiring pit bulls — which were defined by the law as American pit bull terriers, American Staffordshire terriers, Staffordshire bull terriers, crosses including one of those breeds, or dogs that share physical characteristics with those breeds.The law allowed people who already owned pit bulls to keep them, but implemented severe restrictions, including requiring that owners pay a $150 permit fee and that they keep the dogs muzzled and on a short leash in public.The Montreal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals strongly campaigned against the new rules, arguing that since forbidding pit bull adoptions would result in animal shelters having to euthanize some of their animals. Additionally, the group argued that the criteria for keeping pit bulls would force some low-income residents to give up their beloved dogs.The Montreal SPCA initiated a legal battle that ultimately resulted in some provisions being changed. Specifically, a court ruled that the city could not issue a euthanasia order based solely on breed or appearance and could not prevent someone from reclaiming a lost dog based on breed or appearance. Additionally, the city had to continue to allow shelters to adopt out pit bulls to people who reside outside of Montreal city limits.Sauvé’s Friday announcement means that the city will lift any provisions that target pit bulls as a group or place special rules on pit bull ownership that do not apply to other kinds of dogs. However, restrictions on individual dogs that have been deemed dangerous will remain in place.“To reduce dog bites, we need to look at all dogs, because pit bulls, contrary to some urban legends, aren’t a dog that’s more aggressive than others, or a dog that’s particularly dangerous; all dogs are potentially dangerous,” Sauve said, according to the Montreal Gazette.The pit bull ban appeared to be in response to the June 2016 death of Christiane Vadnais, who was killed in an attack by her neighbor’s dog. After the breed of the dog was called into question, a DNA test found that the dog was 87.5 American Staffordshire Terrier (a breed commonly referred to as a pit bull), the CBC reported at the time.Vadnais’ brother, Gaston, and sister, Lise, have spoken out and said they are disappointed that the breed-specific bylaws were being lifted. Lise Vadnais told CTV that she believed the change would lead to more deaths in the future.The Montreal SPCA celebrated the news on Friday.“We’re very happy at the SPCA to know that as of Dec 20th we will be able to place dogs into adoption regardless of what they look like,” lawyer Sophie Gaillard told CTV.Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that bull terriers were included in the ban.

He worries about the growing sophistication of hackers and cybercriminals and the city computer network’s vulnerabilities.So when the Washington State Auditor’s Office started offering local governments a free, in-depth evaluation of their cybersecurity systems, Mill Creek, a city of about 20,000 near Seattle, jumped at the chance in 2015.“It was something we couldn’t afford on our own,” Busch said. “It was a great opportunity for us to see where we needed to improve.”Local governments, especially smaller cities, counties, police agencies and school districts, often don’t have the resources to evaluate their cyber defenses or deal with cyberattacks. Yet just like states, their networks contain vast amounts of information about residents and businesses, such as Social Security, bank account and credit card numbers.Some local governments say they can’t necessarily rely on states for cyber aid because many are busy trying to deal with their own cyber preparedness. But some states, including Washington, Michigan and Virginia, have decided to extend help to the locals. They’re providing training, sending in experts to uncover security vulnerabilities, or lending a hand if a local government has been hit in a cyberattack.“There’s a growing awareness that the key to states being more prepared is ensuring that municipalities and counties are also improving their awareness,” said Timothy Blute, a program director of the National Governors Association’s homeland security division.Local government chief information officers have become increasingly concerned about hackers. Just this week, hackers targeted Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, with ransomware and demanded $23,000 to unlock the affected data. County officials refused to pay and said it would rebuild the applications from scratch. But hours after that announcement Thursday, the hackers struck again.Nearly a third of local government IT officers reported a spike in cyberattacks during the past 12 months, according to a 2016 survey by the International City/County Management Association.Less than half of the local governments had a formal cybersecurity policy or standard, and only a third had a formal, written recovery plan for breaches, the survey found. IT officers cited the inability to pay competitive salaries and a lack of cyber staff and funding as serious barriers to achieving the highest level of cybersecurity.State IT departments historically have focused their cyber efforts on their executive branches, and often don’t have the relationships or infrastructure to provide cyber aid to local governments, said Alan Shark, executive director of the Public Technology Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that provides professional development and consulting services to local government IT executives. “The locals don’t have much faith that they’d get a lot of help.”One option for local governments victimized in a cyberattack, Shark said, is the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, a federally funded group that tracks cybersecurity issues for states and local governments.The center can offer assistance, either remotely or in person, and help identify how a virus or attack occurred, how to prevent it from spreading, and how to get the system back to normal, said vice president Brian Calkin. This year, the center has assisted about 90 local governments that were attacked.States Step UpMichigan is one state that’s trying to change that image for local governments. It is the only one that has created a volunteer team of highly trained cybersecurity experts from the public and private sectors who can provide local governments technical assistance if they get hit by a cyberattack or data breach.And in May, Michigan launched a one-year pilot program designed to help local governments identify their biggest cyber vulnerabilities, create a plan to fix them, and then put solutions into practice. “Cybersecurity is a concern for everyone no matter what size you are,” said Rajiv Das, Michigan’s chief security officer. “If the counties are cyber secure, it helps us when we exchange data with them — and vice versa.”Michigan’s pilot started with five local governments and has since added four more, Das said. The program has cost the state Department of Technology, Management and Budget about $200,000, most of which pays for a consultant to work with the locals.While the pilot is free for local governments through April 2018, participants will need to fund the program themselves after that, Das said.Virginia also helps local governments strengthen their cybersecurity by making available a National Guard cyber brigade of experts to test IT vulnerabilities.“This allows them to get an outside set of eyeballs to see what they’ve done and what they need to do to make them safe,” said Virginia Secretary of Technology Karen Jackson.Jackson said nearly a dozen local governments have participated in the program, which is free for them but is costing the state about $150,000. It started last year and will run through June 2018, unless it is renewed.In Georgia, officials plan to offer local governments training through the Georgia Cybersecurity Workforce Academy, which started last year to teach state IT security employees how to build a secure cyber program and respond to an attack. Next year, that training will include local governments, said Stanton Gatewood, Georgia’s chief information security officer.“The states have a duty to help the local governments,” he said. “We’re all in the same boat so why not mobilize and protect and defend each other?”Independent AuditsWashington state started offering local governments independent audits of their cyber defenses three years ago.The reviews by contractors and state auditors and IT security specialists assess a system’s vulnerabilities, perform technical tests to see if it can be penetrated, and recommend improvements. The audits take six months to two years and cost the state $150,000 to $300,000 each.Funding comes from a 2005 voter initiative that allotted a bit of Washington’s sales tax revenue to the auditor’s office to conduct performance audits for local governments. The office later expanded the mission to include cybersecurity audits.So far, two cyber audits, including Mill Creek’s, have been finished, and 10 are ongoing, according to program manager Peg Bodin.As a result of his city’s audit, Mill Creek IT manager Busch said, officials there have developed new cyber policies and now require cyber training for every employee.The lessons learned came in handy. Just a few weeks after the training, Busch said, the city got phished “big time.” But an employee who received the phony email, which looked as though it came from a colleague, didn’t open it and instead reported the incident.Having an independent assessment also can be useful politically, Busch said.“We can use it to go back to elected officials and say we need to upgrade and put in security measures,” he said. “It helps lend some credibility and some oomph behind what you’re saying, especially when you’re a one-man shop.”Stateline home pageSign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research "

July 1, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a2b0083190000be3503558f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Many of us would like to believe that this new Republican party under Trump is something of an anomaly: a one-off populist phenomenon that doesn’t really represent conservatives in America, nor the American people at large. Yet, the GOP’s recent tax bill reveals a party that follows a long line of Republican thinking that can be traced back to the Reaganites of the 1980s. The recycled and tired concepts include: a fantastical belief in trickle-down economics, the rolling-back of “big” governmental programs (except for national defense, of course), and the alleged empowerment of Americans through unfettered capitalist competition. Also included is a strong, evangelical Christian bent: a devolution of power from the federal government to states and eventually to individual churches and religious schools, and “protection of the unborn.” Indeed, these are all included and mentioned in the tax bill, even the anti-abortion line. This tax legislation represents a concerted Republican attempt to prove to themselves and the public that they still have the moral and political will to bind together and further upper-class, business-minded, white-American interests. And dare I say, they succeeded. What will be the worst effects of this legislation? The continual breaking down of the concept and the reality of “public institutions,” for a start. This, again, is a popular GOP concept since the Reagan era, when government was framed as evil, lethargic, ineffective and almost, un-American. In the continuing fight over the meaning and image of the United States, perhaps this represents a final chapter of sorts: the nail in the coffin that kills public schools, including famed higher education institutions, a rescinding of tax breaks that make viable state spending on local initiatives (including education), an irreversible reward to corporations and high-income earners. This legislation is so total in its attack on non-elite interests, and indeed on anything that smacks of “public,” that it will take years of “public” action to overturn the damage to American workers, middle-class earners and students. The scarier reality is that this legislation accurately represents the will of the citizenry, in which case, either things will have to get much worse before reversing the trend rightward, or, welcome to the renewed America of the 1980s.Is this the “great” America so frequently referred to in Trumpian speeches and rhetoric? Perhaps. A curious example of this vision of America lies in the heartland state of Kansas. In 2010, Governor Sam Brownback was elected on a platform of drastically cutting government spending and taxes in order to boost individual wealth. The result was quite the opposite: the state quickly lost pace in job growth, lower income citizens were made poorer because of sales taxes higher than income tax, and its education finance system was so underfunded that it was declared unconstitutionally low. Gov. Brownback’s policy was overturned by his own Republican-run legislature in 2017, and he left the post shortly after. Yet, the contenders that stand to win the governorship want to continue his goal of a zero percent income tax. And former Gov. Brownback? Trump named him as “ambassador-at-large for international religious freedom.” Welcome, again, to the great America."

ICE officers snatched him in the hallways of a Brooklyn court and subjected him to deportation.As an immigration attorney at The Bronx Defenders, a public defender office in the Bronx, I have been representing people in deportation proceedings for the past seven years. I am also a New Yorker and I am part of the more than three million immigrants who call this city our home.I am furious as I write this because the maneuvers of President Trump, his deportation cronies, and his draconian immigration policies are threatening my community’s access to justice. What happened last week in Brooklyn is happening everywhere in New York. In the Bronx where I work, we are no strangers to this horrible crisis. Mothers are afraid of fighting for the custody of their children, workers are afraid to stand up to their employers in court, and my clients are not able to exercise their constitutional right to defend themselves in court.The statistics are chilling. According to the Immigrant Defense Project, there has been an increase of nine hundred percent in arrests from ICE in court since last year. ICE agents lurk in the hallways of justice, seize immigrants away from their family, friends and community, and deprive them of their right to have their day in court.As an immigration lawyer, I represent people daily who are seeking asylum in the United States because they were victims of crimes who could not seek protection from their governments. That was the very reason why I fled my native Ecuador a decade ago and sought refuge in this great country. After being a victim of a hate crime, Ecuadorian law enforcement agencies were unwilling to provide me with protection from my aggressors. How is it that my new home can no longer guarantee access to justice to people like me? Since when does the place where one is born now determines whether one can see a judge in America?But make no mistake. This is not a problem that affects only immigrants. This is a crisis for everyone who lives in New York. When people don’t feel safe accessing the judicial system, we all lose. Slumlords expand their reign of abuse against tenants, parents are unable to reunite with their children, and the accused are unable to defend themselves in court.And a domino effect compounds the problem: people stop trusting law enforcement agencies, fewer crimes are reported, our courts are unable to adjudicate cases, the rule of law becomes blurry, and impunity reigns. This is no doubt a crisis for the public safety of all New Yorkers.ICE needs to be stopped and it needs to be stopped today. We cannot expect ICE to change its policies any time soon. The Trump Administration has little respect for our Constitution and due process rights provided by our laws. So it is in the hands of our leaders in New York to stop the erosion of trust in the court system and the undermining of equal access to justice. It is imperative that Chief Judge Janet DiFiore takes all the necessary steps to stop federal immigration agents from using our courts system to trap immigrants. Without her intervention, this crisis will worsen, endangering all New Yorkers and the integrity of our court system."

In the lawsuit, Greene said her boss sexually harassed her and created a hostile work environment. She also levied accusations of gender discrimination against him.Another Farenthold aide told Greene that the congressman said he had “sexual fantasies” and “wet dreams” about Greene, she said, and when Greene complained, she was fired.Greene’s case was settled and the lawsuit dropped, Politico reported.The Ethics Committee said it would investigate the claim and other allegations that Farenthold made “inappropriate statements to other members of his official staff.” However, it noted that “establishing an investigative subcommittee does not itself indicate that any violation has occurred.”In a statement to HuffPost last week, Farenthold said he could not confirm that his office was behind the $84,000 settlement.“While I 100% support more transparency with respect to claims against members of Congress, I can neither confirm nor deny that settlement involved my office as the Congressional Accountability Act prohibits me from answering that question,” he said.Two of Farenthold’s colleagues, Reps. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.) and Mia Love (R-Utah), and have called for him to step down following the reports.A growing number of congressional lawmakers have undergone intense scrutiny over allegations of sexual misconduct, including Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.), who announced Thursday that he would resign in the coming weeks. Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) also announced his retirement this week amid allegations of impropriety, and Rep.

Instead of building a $700 million electric vehicle factory in Michigan as promised in January, Ford will construct the plant in Mexico. Ford reneged on its promise to Michigan workers just days after the Senate passed a tax plan intended to end levies on corporate profits made at factories offshore – in places like Mexico. News of the letdown also arrived just days before new negotiations on a revised North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) are to begin in Washington, D.C.Ford and other giant corporations got what they wanted out of Republicans on taxes, dramatically lower levies on domestic profits and total elimination on foreign profits. That makes Mexico an even more attractive manufacturing site for them than NAFTA did. So now they’re lobbying the Trump administration hard to retain the privileges that NAFTA bestowed on them. If they win that argument, they’ll have secured double incentives to offshore. Trump administration officials don’t sound like they’re buying the corporate line, however. And they shouldn’t. NAFTA has cost Americans nearly a million jobs as thousands of factories migrated to Mexico. As he campaigned, President Trump promised untold numbers of factory workers and their families across the nation’s industrial belt that he would fix or end NAFTA to keep jobs and industry in America. He needs to keep that promise. That means elimination of the Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) scam that allows corporations to sue governments in secret courts presided over by corporate lawyers when legislatures pass laws corporations don’t like. That means standing strong on the Trump administration demands that the new pact expire in five years if it’s not working and that a substantial portion of automobiles – including Fords – be made in the USA to attain duty-free status. It means strong protection for workers’ right to organize and collectively bargain. It means substantially raising the Mexican minimum wage, which now stands at $4.70. That’s for a day, not an hour. What it really means is prioritizing the needs of workers over the demands of corporations, something that was not done the first time around by NAFTA negotiators. As it stands now, NAFTA places all of the jeopardy on the shoulders of workers and communities while substantially eliminating normal business risks for corporations. The jeopardy NAFTA created for workers is that its corporate-friendly provisions prompt employers to close American factories that sustain both workers and communities and move them to Mexico. This exodus of American manufacturing to Mexico has continued apace this year, even as the Trump administration began renegotiating NAFTA, probably because corporations assume they’ll get everything they want in the end. They have, after all, always done so in the past because they are, after all, massive political campaign donors and lobby firm patrons, while hourly workers are not. Bloomberg reported in October, for example, that firms whose function it is to help corporations move factories from the United States to Mexico had a boom year in 2017, with one reporting it had done more offshoring this year than in any during the previous three decades. Mexico is alluring because of its dirt-cheap wage rates, the paucity of environmental enforcement and the ISDS scam that lets corporations sue the government if Mexico would regulate in a way some CEO claims would crimp his profits. The ISDS along with NAFTA’s unlimited lifespan reduce risk for corporations. Normal business decisions in capitalist systems involve some jeopardy. A chemical company could, for example, invest in developing a new pesticide, but then lose when the government bans the product after determining it kills babies as well as bugs. NAFTA provides corporations with investment protection because it ensures they’ll get their profits even if a government changes regulations. ISDS enables corporations to sue to recoup money the corporations supposedly would have made if the government hadn’t issued new laws or regulations. The corporate-run court can order a country’s citizens to pay tens of millions to the corporation. Some say this government-financed investment insurance corrupts capitalism. Among the significant people who have is U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. He said corporations are insisting the government absolve CEOs of political risk. CEOs are using ISDS as a guarantee rather than buying risk insurance or factoring political risk into economic decisions about whether to move. Lighthizer said businessmen have literally told him the administration cannot change ISDS because corporations wouldn’t have invested in Mexico without it. “I’m thinking,” he said, “‘Well, then, why is it a good policy of the United States government to encourage investment in Mexico?’”These are the same corporate honchos who object to a five-year sunset clause for a new NAFTA, he said. They want a free eternal warranty on the provisions of a deal they describe as the world’s greatest. Lighthizer’s response is that if the deal is so great, why would the government choose to end it after five years? What are they really worried about?The worry may be that those CEOs know NAFTA is great for their bottom line but not for the workers who elected Donald Trump President. They know NAFTA was drafted by CEOs for CEOs. Its priorities were determined by corporate bigwigs behind doors closed to the public. Corporations designed it at the expense of workers and ordinary citizens, Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel Prize winning economist, said in an op-ed in the Guardian newspaper this week. It often seems, he wrote, “that workers, who have seen their wages fall and jobs disappear, are just collateral damage – innocent but unavoidable victims in the inexorable march of economic progress. But there is another interpretation of what has happened: one of the objectives of globalization was to weaken workers’ bargaining power. What corporations wanted was cheaper labor, however they could get it.”U.S. corporations like Ford got it by writing a trade deal that gave them market-distorting profit protections, then abandoning their dedicated American workers and moving to Mexico where they could pay $4.70 a day and pollute unfettered. President Trump has threatened to withdraw from NAFTA if his negotiators can’t get new reasonable terms that protect American manufacturing and American workers.That is right. It’s appropriate that corporations like Ford sustain the actual risk of offshoring rather than workers bearing it all. "

(HuffPost’s parent company Oath is owned by Verizon, but HuffPost’s union is represented by the Writers Guild of America, East, which supports net neutrality.)The mayoral group, which includes leaders from the across the political spectrum and from cities big and small, made a strong case for the fundamental importance of an open internet on the local level, saying that everything from economic strength to basic government services are at risk with the repeal.“Our economies, educational institutions, government agencies, and communities, in general, increasingly rely on broadband connectivity and the transformative power of the Internet to drive economic growth, individual and community development, and improve government service and accountability for all our citizens,” they wrote.“Critical to our communities’ reliance on the Internet is the confidence that our use of the Internet is not subject to the whims, discretion, or economic incentives of gatekeeper service providers to control or manipulate the experience of Internet users.”The mayors highlighted a lesser-known aspect of Pai’s proposal as especially worrisome: In addition to repealing net neutrality, the FCC rules will also strip state and local governments of the power to enact their own laws regulating broadband service.Not only does that provision prevent “local leaders such as ourselves from protecting our constituents, businesses, and economies from abusive service provider practices,” they wrote, it also “represents a stark, inexplicable, and unwarranted attack on ‘the constitutional principles that lie at the heart of our system of government.’”“In sum, we strongly oppose the Commission’s proposal,” the letter concludes. “It offers carte blanche to powerful service providers but little more than promises to consumers. The Commission’s approach puts those few companies ahead of millions of Americans, tens of thousands of businesses which depend on a free and open Internet, and local communities solving everyday problems Americans face.”Read the letter here."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a2abb9f190000492c035485.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Pope Francis has expressed concerns about a traditional translation of the Lord’s Prayer, an ancient prayer that Jesus Christ taught his disciples and is repeated by Christians around the world today.The current wording of the prayer in the Catholic liturgical tradition contains a line that says, “Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.” But Francis suggested that this common translation may be misleading.In an interview with the Italian Catholic channel TV2000, published on YouTube Wednesday, the pontiff pointed out that God isn’t the one who leads humans to sin. That’s Satan’s job, Francis said.“It is not a good translation because it speaks of a God who induces temptation,” the pope said, according to a translation provided by The Guardian.“I am the one who falls; it’s not him pushing me into temptation to then see how I have fallen. A father doesn’t do that, a father helps you to get up immediately. It’s Satan who leads us into temptation, that’s his department.”The pope then referred to the French Catholic church, which has started using the phrase “do not let us fall into temptation.”The Lord’s Prayer appears in two books of the Christian New Testament. It is a foundational prayer in Christianity, and is used as a form of worship and supplication by Christians in many denominations.Catholics say the prayer during Mass and while praying the rosary. Children memorize the prayer as part of their religious education. It is also common practice for Christians to analyze every line of the prayer, using it to glean insights about how Jesus wanted his followers to live and pray. The pope’s comments were part of just such an endeavor. The TV2000 program that he appeared on is just one episode in a series that the channel is doing that studies the lines of The Lord’s Prayer. Austen Ivereigh, a British Catholic journalist who wrote the definitive biography on Francis, told The Guardian that he wasn’t aware of plans to officially change the Lord’s Prayer translation in the English world. “But you can certainly see the logic of doing so,” Ivereigh said. “It is not God who tempts us into sin but the enemy of human nature.

For almost every weekend since the primaries ended in June, I volunteered all my extra time to register voters, knock on doors, call potential voters, fund raise and write op-eds. I know that I am not alone. The amazing victory in Virginia in November belongs to us, ordinary people, doing everything we can on the ground to elect lawmakers who support working families. For all our hard work, we need to demand more from the officials that we helped elect. I am ecstatic that Medicaid expansion is back on the table, that we have a champion to protect our voting rights from gerrymandering and felony disenfranchisement, and that our reproductive rights are safe. However, when it comes to racial justice, more work needs to be done. People of color deserve more from Virginia’s politicians. During the time I was volunteering for the campaign, I was also working to change the Confederate name of a local high school in Fairfax County. Two Democratic members of the Fairfax County school board, Megan McLaughlin and Tammy Kaufax, voted consistently with the Republican members to delay changing the name, abstained from voting for a change and instead voted to rename J.E.B. Stuart High School, Stuart High School. Their votes reflect a lack of understanding for the deep and painful racial history Confederate names recount for people of color. This should be a straightforward issue with an easy fix, but these elected school board members of Fairfax County demonstrate that they still don’t get it. The reality is that many of the issues that matter most to communities of color and immigrants are overlooked or given lower priority in the commonwealth’s legislative agenda. But immigrants and people of color, like myself, worked hard to elect candidates who campaigned on diversity. Our desires for the future of Virginia’s politics are reflected in the unbelievable increase in Black, Latinx, Asian, and Arab candidates who won delegate seats on election night. It’s not enough for our representatives to simply push back against racist, anti-immigrant messages like the ones we saw from Republican candidate for governor, Ed Gillespie. They must also actively champion pro-immigrant initiatives. A place to start: All Virginia Democrats must push local sheriffs, such as Fairfax County’s sheriff Stacey Kincaid, to end any agreements they have with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to pick up and detain undocumented immigrants. On a state level, Virginia lawmakers can fight for in-state tuition and driver licences with undocumented students and guarantee that certain areas such as schools, courts, and other government buildings provide a safe space that prohibit entry to ICE officers. Our votes and our voices helped elect the wave of Democratic candidates that swept the ticket on November 7th. I hope that our newly elected representatives recognize and honor all the work people of color put into the election and reciprocate it by being champions for racial justice rather than just harm reduction compared to the GOP. I hope our newly elected officials will hold themselves to a higher standard and be truly worthy of all our hard work during the campaign. Because we’ll be watching our new representatives closely. And we know (and they know too) that our voices have power, our votes matter, and the time is now in Virginia.

While some of her scripts and ideas would have been turned down before for being too “niche,” she said things seem to be changing.“Because of the success of ‘Girls Trip,’ meetings have become night and day from before,” she wrote in the column, published Friday. “I’ve been wanting to do a ′Girls Trip’-esque TV show for a long time, and just a couple years ago, I was told there’s no audience for that. Now that idea has resurfaced as a viable TV series.”“Every day, I’m getting calls from studios and networks bringing me in about scripts to rewrite or ideas to critique that don’t have any black characters whatsoever,” she added. “It’s a beautiful thing, that Hollywood may be coming around to the idea that even if people have different cultural perspectives, that we’re all just human.”As Oliver writes, the box office success of “Girls Trip” surprised many in Hollywood. The film, which premiered in July, became the first comedy of 2017 to surpass $100 million at the box office. And it made history by being the first film with an all-black team to do so. Eventually, the film grossed a total of $137 million worldwide.The movie’s overwhelming success has somewhat shifted the way some executives view films starring black characters, according to Oliver, but she says there’s still room for growth. She shared five tone-deaf comments that she and colleagues have heard in meetings recently, including, “Instead of surgeons, can they be gospel artists or hip-hop dancers?”Oliver has been vocal and passionate about choosing to write for black women, and she told Essence the decision is rooted in frustration. “I thought I was going to be an actor and then at Stanford I was kind of frustrated with the lack of opportunities I was getting as a performer,” she told the magazine in October. “That’s when I realized that if I was going to change that I’d need to learn how to write, direct and produce.”It seems to have paid off for Oliver. “Girls Trip” was recently nominated for three Critics’ Choice Awards.

42,ENTERTAINMENT,"With 'Gunpowder' And 'Knightfall,' Tom Cullen Has Arrived",Leigh Blickley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/with-gunpowder-and-knightfall-tom-cullen-has-arrived_us_5a270869e4b0ee6f96380187,Tatiana Maslany's leading man (and Kit Harington's drama school mate) finds his own nook in Hollywood.,2017-12-08,"Tom Cullen (left) with Kit Harington in ""Gunpowder."" ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a298265140000f36fb6c053.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"While we patiently wait for new episodes of “Game of Thrones,” HBO is giving us a gift. Titled “Gunpowder,” the network’s new three-part miniseries will put Kit Harington back on our television screens. This time, he’s joined by one of his longtime mates Tom Cullen.In the show, set to air Dec. 18, 32-year-old Cullen plays Guy Fawkes, the British activist who, along with a group of provincial English Catholics, plotted to kill King James I in the early 17th century. Meanwhile, the beloved Jon Snow actor plays his own distant relative Robert Catesby, a man who was equally as influential in the Gunpowder Plot as Fawkes.Cullen says he had a wonderful time on set with his pal Harington, whom he met in drama school when he was about 20.“He’s always been ugly, actually. I can confirm that,” Cullen joked to HuffPost on Build Series.“He’s such a great guy and he’s such a brilliant actor and he’s fantastic in ‘Gunpowder,’” Cullen added. “It was so nice to be able to get to work with him and share a screen with him, having known each other since we started the journey together in many ways.” Cullen began acting in the 2000s, but didn’t break through until 2011, when he was named Most Promising Newcomer at the British Independent Film Awards for his role in Andrew Haigh’s refreshing romantic drama “Weekend.” Since receiving that accolade, he’s worked tirelessly over the last few years to find roles that would challenge him artistically. After making some memorable appearances on “Downton Abbey” as Lord Gillingham in 2013–2014 and starring in a few films, Cullen took a break to contemplate his future in acting. Not only did he come across the opportunity in “Gunpowder” during that time, but he managed to squeeze in a meaningful directing project near his hometown of Aberystwyth, Wales. “Pink Wall” is Cullen’s directorial debut; a drama he wrote starring his girlfriend of six years, Tatiana Maslany, and Jay Duplass. It follows a couple through different stages of their romance, in what Cullen describes as a “patchwork of memories.” He used his own relationship with Maslany ― whom he calls “Tat” ― to guide the script, turning to her for inspiration and advice. “I’m an empathetic guy. I talk to Tat a lot about her experience as a female, but I can never tell her how she feels. I can never fully understand the female experience. So it was great to hand it over to her and defer to her and go, ’What is this? Let’s write it together.′ And so it created a very interesting, very complex, very rich story, I hope.” “One of the reasons I became an actor is because I wanted to direct,” he said, adding that he’s about to start the edit on the film, which he calls “one of the most rewarding, thrilling experiences of my life.”Cullen eventually came across another role that tested his skills, and frightened him in the process: Templar Knight Landry in History Channel’s “Knightfall.” The show, which debuted Wednesday, follows the military-religious brotherhood on their quest to uncover the Holy Grail in the 14th century. Despite the show’s lackluster reviews, Cullen brings a distinct edge to his performance.“From a kind of egotistical view as an an actor, I want to do stuff that really terrifies me, and the character seemed so huge. I was genuinely, genuinely terrified by the kind of scope and scale of the mountain I had to climb in order to play him,” Cullen said.Before “Knightfall,” Cullen had read script after script, hoping at least one story would pique his interest. The period piece did it for him, not only because of its subject matter and familiar themes of love, death and politics, but “the complexity of the characters.”“When I read it, I was just like, ‘Oh man, this is not something I’ve been waiting for the last five months to do, it’s something I’ve been waiting my whole life to do.’ Since I was a little boy, running around pretending to be a knight, fighting in slow-motion,” he said. As a child, Cullen would play make-believe with his “feral mates,” who would act out roles from different eras of history. To prepare to play Landry, he got back into that mindset, bathing himself in literature and getting into medieval shape with a grueling workout routine. “I looked like a cross between a gerbil and a Christmas pudding,” Cullen joked about his physique ahead of filming. “So I had to go to the gym for, like, three or four hours a day. Ugh, it was horrible. Like broccoli and just chicken. It’s so dull.”With these two new projects comes a bit of notoriety, something Cullen isn’t necessarily prepared for. Although he’s watched peers like Harington and Maslany carve their own paths with successful roles on “GoT” and “Orphan Black,” respectively, Cullen says it’s beyond strange to drive past a “Knightfall” billboard with his face on it. “Honestly, I find it quite difficult to comprehend,” he said. “I come from a tiny little town with, like, 1,000 people. I grew up on a farm and I kind of had this dream of being an actor, and to be here in New York sat here talking to you, it’s constantly surreal. It’s something I don’t think I’ll ever quite get used to. It’s very compartmentalized. It doesn’t really feel like me.” Sure, it’s hard to launch a Hollywood career, but Cullen takes every opportunity he’s given and continues to learn. “Unless you’re Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise, you don’t really get a lot of choice. So, for me, the hardest thing is having the patience to try to find the thing that you want to do and being a part of that slog,” he said. “It just sounds like such a cliche, [a] saccharine actor talking about how grateful that he is, but it’s true. I am. Like every time I get a job, I’m like, ‘Whaaat?! They’re idiots! What are they thinking?!’ I have such an embarrassing case of the imposter syndrome. But I’m going to get found out, definitely, if I haven’t already.” “Knightfall” airs Wednesdays at 10 p.m. on History Channel. “Gunpowder” premieres Dec. 18 on HBO. "
43,MEDIA,Powerful Gossip Editor Dylan Howard Was Also Investigated At Celebuzz,Maxwell Strachan,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dylan-howard-celebuzz_us_5a2b02c8e4b069ec48ad56b4,"“Right off the bat, he made every woman in the office feel incredibly uncomfortable,” a former Celebuzz producer said.",2017-12-08,"A Celebuzz producer described Howard, seen here in 2014, as “creating a toxic environment” at the company.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a2b04a81900003b00cca402.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Dylan Howard, the chief content officer of American Media Inc., was the subject of an internal investigation into sexual misconduct during his brief stint in charge of the celebrity site Celebuzz, multiple sources have told HuffPost ― the second investigation into Howard’s behavior to be made public this week. Howard joined Celebuzz as editor-in-chief in early 2012 following his first stint at AMI, where he had been investigated for misconduct just months before, as The Associated Press reported this week and HuffPost independently confirmed.Early on at the job, Howard made his new colleagues uncomfortable. They knew of his personal reputation, and his behavior once there did nothing to disabuse them of their preconceptions.“We knew and it was very well known that he had some type of inappropriate behavior at work with his female employees,” said a former Celebuzz editor who worked directly with Howard. “You knew it was going to go downhill.” (HuffPost spoke with a number of former employees, all of whom wished to remain anonymous because they still work in the industry.)A second former Celebuzz employee said in an email that she recalled Howard making “inappropriate remarks” about being attracted to a co-worker during his time there. “His way of relating and cutting lose with his co-workers seemed to be by telling crass and shocking stories that were offensive at times,” the former employee said.A third employee said that Howard made her “feel like my job was threatened” because she was pregnant. “It was a real hostile work environment,” she said.A separate former Celebuzz producer described Howard as “creating a toxic environment” at the company. “Right off the bat, he made every woman in the office feel incredibly uncomfortable,” the producer said.At one point, she said, “He called me into his office, shut the door and berated me because a woman he slept with who he found ‘fucking disgusting’ had her period all over the bed, yelled at me and said, ‘What the fuck is wrong with women like you? Get out.’” (Three people confirmed to HuffPost that the employee told them the story at the time.)In a statement provided to HuffPost, Howard denied that he ever made such a statement, calling it “incredibly offensive” and based on the memories of a “disgruntled former employee.”“Let me be crystal clear and very direct: The statement HuffPo attributed to me never came out my mouth. It is incredibly offensive, and deeply saddening that a media organization would publish such abhorrent words — as fact — based on the threadbare sourcing of a disgruntled former employee,” he said.“My 2012 tenure at BuzzMedia was thoroughly reviewed, as the AP reported Friday, and the undisputable fact is that this claim was not made until HuffPo chose to publish it in 2017,” he added.HuffPost followed up with the source about Howard’s response. ”It happened, standing by the story,” she wrote. The producer ultimately left the company of her own accord in late 2012, she said.“I just want nothing to do with this place,” she said. While she never filed an official complaint, she said she “certainly let them know during my exit interview that he was the reason I was leaving because I could not stand to be a part of that.”In early 2013, employees around the newsroom became aware that Howard had come under internal investigation over harassment allegations, a source close to the situation said. The AP reported Friday that an internal investigator wrote a letter in April 2013 saying Howard violated the company’s sexual harassment policy, citing eight separate allegations, which included throwing a “sexual aid” at an employee, the AP said.“There is nothing here that has any truth to it,” Howard told the AP. AMI did not immediately respond to a request for comment from HuffPost.One of the Celebuzz employees confirmed to HuffPost she was contacted in early 2013 by the company “very specifically to ask me about sexual stuff.” “I could basically confirm that he was inappropriate and would make comments that were completely unprofessional,” she said.“And then, he was gone,” the employee added.After just a little over a year at Celebuzz, Howard left the site and returned to AMI. He has since risen up the masthead and now controls a trove of tabloid brands, including the National Enquirer and Radar Online, as part of his new role as chief content officer. It’s not clear if Howard left Celebuzz as a result of the investigation. Earlier this week, the AP reported that former employees at AMI felt Howard often belittled and degraded female employees at the office. That AP story contained a number of allegations. Former reporter Liz Crokin said Howard once asked her if she was “going to be walking the streets tonight” when she was wearing heels. He told another former employee he wanted to create a Facebook page for her vagina. He forced women to watch pornography. His nickname for himself was “Dildo.”Howard has called the claims about his behavior “baseless,” and AMI has said that Howard “has the full support of AMI and its executives.” A lawyer for AMI, Cam Stracher, said the investigation into Howard’s alleged misconduct found nothing seriously impermissible.The Australian journalist first became embroiled in controversy last month, when Ronan Farrow reported in The New Yorker that Howard had obtained negative information on actress Rose McGowan on behalf of Harvey Weinstein ― part of the film mogul’s complex campaign to dig up dirt on his vast number of potential accusers. McGowan has since accused Weinstein of rape.This article has been updated with a response from Dylan Howard and a follow-up reply from the source."

Current regulations require internet providers to treat all online content equally. If the FCC votes to end net neutrality, internet service providers will be allowed to create slow and fast internet lanes for different content providers and price structures. The associated Battle For the Net phone call mobilization campaign has resulted in more than 800,000 calls to Congress, urging lawmakers to step in and block the FCC vote.Supporters also asked internet users, websites, apps and small businesses to participate in a “Break the Internet” online protest starting 48 hours before the vote. The goal is to make sites appear broken or inaccessible, as many will be for countless internet users if the FCC ends the net neutrality protections.Protesters in Chicago chanted: “FCC, keep the internet free.” In Manhattan, demonstrators shouted: “It’s time to fret, we cannot let them have the net.”Democratic FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, who opposes the move to end net neutrality protections, tweeted a photo of herself at a protest in Washington, D.C. Demonstrators gathered outside the annual FCC dinner.The FCC, whose five members include three Republicans and two Democrats, is expected to pass Chairman Ajit Pai’s plan to roll back the rules. Several Democratic senators have urged him to delay the vote, pointing out that hundreds of “public comments” backing Paj’s plan were fake.“Today’s protests show how passionately Americans care about net neutrality, and how fed up they are with lawmakers siding with giant telecoms over ordinary people,” Mark Stanley, spokesman for Demand Progress, said in a statement. “The fate of the internet won’t be decided by a few corrupt bureaucrats and phone company lobbyists in Washington,” Free Press Action Fund field director Mary Alice Crim said.Wireless and broadband companies have lobbied for the net neutrality changes opposed by their individual and business clients. Verizon, which owns Oath, the parent company of HuffPost, was chosen as a target for the protests because Pai used to work as a Verizon lawyer. Verizon said it will not block or slow access to the internet.“Like those expressing their views today, Verizon fully supports an open internet and believe consumers should be able to use it to access lawful content when, where, and how they want,” the company said in a statement on Thursday. “We’ve publicly committed to that before and we stand by that commitment today.”Last month, Verizon said it was “very encouraged by chairman Pai’s announcement ... that the FCC will move forward to restore the successful light-touch regulatory framework for internet services.”The Broadband for America trade group said in a statement that the nation’s broadband providers were “100 percent committed to a free and open internet.”But in a press conference call on Wednesday, former FCC chairman Tom Wheeler asked: If internet providers say they’re not going to end net neutrality, “What’s wrong with rules that say you’re not going to do it?”"

It would have been three hours by car.Zinke’s office justified the travel as official business and slammed Politico for its media inquiries. “Shame on you for not respecting the office of a Member of Congress,” Heather Swift, a spokeswoman for the Interior secretary, wrote to Politico. Zinke previously was a congressman from Montana.The inspector general’s office at the Interior Department is already investigating Zinke’s use of taxpayer-funded charter flights after he came under fire for such travel along with other members of the Trump administration, including Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt and former Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price. Zinke and his staffers traveled on charter or military planes multiple times to go to events in Montana, his home state, and to islands in the Caribbean.His office has defended the flights, and Zinke himself said the reports were “a little BS.”This isn’t the first time Zinke has come under scrutiny for his behavior in office. Last month, HuffPost reported that the Interior Department’s office worked throughout March to decorate the secretary’s suite to his liking, which included mounting the heads of a bison and elk on the wall and moving a large taxidermy grizzly bear around.Staff also had to accommodate the arrival of a $1,749 leather couch from California (including “white-glove delivery”) and a stuffed bobcat from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s collection."

47,POLITICS,3 Members Of Trump Panel Warn Of Voter Fraud To Influential Conservative Group,Sam Levine,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-voter-fraud-commission-alec_us_5a29bfbde4b069ec48abff48,"""The greatest foreign influence in our elections are aliens who are getting on the rolls,” said one member.",2017-12-08,"Hans von Spakovsky, a member of the president's voter fraud commission, thinks states need to do more to clean up voting rolls.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a29c28c1900003b00cca11c.jpeg?cache=3KpAEZW3L7&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NASHVILLE — Three members of President Donald Trump’s voter fraud commission raised alarms about allegedly widespread voter fraud and poked at a popular voting reform on Thursday, while speaking before one of the country’s most powerful conservative groups.Several studies and investigations have shown that voter fraud is not a widespread problem.But Hans von Spakovsky and J. Christian Adams told members of the American Legislative Exchange Council that voter fraud is actually prevalent in the U.S. and talked about the need to better identify the many non-citizens and other people who they claim are illegally on the voter rolls. A third member of the commission, Christy McCormick, highlighted potential problems with automatic voter registration, an idea that has bipartisan support and that advocates hope can dramatically expand the number of people who do vote.ALEC, the group that hosted the “voting integrity” panel discussion on Thursday, consists of thousands of state lawmakers. The group helps prepare model legislation, often advancing conservative causes, that the lawmakers can then take back to their states.ALEC did not advertise the speakers on the panel beforehand. The presence of three members of the presidential commission is likely to raise questions from watchdog groups, who had already expressed concern on Wednesday that ALEC was taking a renewed interest in voting issues. After successfully pushing voter ID measures across the country, the organization had disbanded its public safety and elections task force in 2012 under pressure from civil rights groups. An ALEC spokesman, Bill Meierling, said Wednesday that the organization was not focused on voting again.Adams, a former Justice Department official who now heads the Public Interest Legal Foundation, told the dozens of state lawmakers in the room that the most pressing issue when it came to voter integrity was no longer voter ID — 34 states now have some such measure in place — but non-citizens’ presence on the voter rolls.“Voter ID is an important thing, but it’s yesterday’s fight,” Adams said. “Now we have things, probably the most dangerous thing affecting the integrity of our elections ― we hear a lot about foreign influence. Well, I can tell you the greatest foreign influence in our elections are aliens who are getting on the rolls and aliens who are voting.”Adams, who has sued local jurisdictions over voter roll maintenance, offered a series of recommendations on how to maintain voter rolls. Among other moves, he wants to make sure that electoral officials can see when people opt out of jury duty, establish online voter registration and allow election officials to audit the voter rolls.He also recommended that states consider citizenship verification requirements when people register. He claimed there was nothing preventing non-citizens from getting on the voter rolls, other than the honor system.Civil rights groups oppose proof-of-citizenship measures, arguing that the poor, the elderly and minorities often lack or cannot afford documents like a passport or birth certificate to prove their citizenship. The American Civil Liberties Union is challenging a 2011 Kansas law requiring proof of citizenship to vote, which it’s estimated could affect thousands of people. A federal judge stepped in to block the law ahead of the 2016 election.McCormick focused on automatic voter registration, a process adopted by 10 states so far in which eligible people are automatically added to the voter rolls when they interact with a motor vehicle agency or some other state agencies. Once people fill out the forms, they are given the choice of opting out.Oregon was the first state to adopt the process in 2015; eight states and the District of Columbia have followed since. But McCormick said lawmakers might be too hasty in latching on to the idea without seeing how it plays out in practice. She also suggested that even with the opt-out option, automatically registering people to vote could violate their speech protections under the U.S. Constitution.“I do think there is a fundamental question: Does automatic voter registration violate the Constitution? Congress, or government, should not be making any law abridging the freedom of speech,” she said. “The First Amendment includes the right not to speak as well as the right to speak.”Von Spakovsky, a former Justice Department official now at the Heritage Foundation, touted the Interstate Crosscheck Program, a system run by Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R), who is also the vice chair and de facto leader of Trump’s commission. The system compares voting rolls from dozens of states that volunteer that information and then identifies the people registered in more than one state. Although it’s not illegal to be registered in two states ― it often happens when people move ― Crosscheck aims to help election administrators clean up their voting rolls.He also suggested that states compare their voter rolls against federal databases of non-citizens and people who have died. Experts say that’s an unreliable way to identify voter fraud with a lot of false positives.Studies have highlighted the inaccuracy of Crosscheck, noting that it flags hundreds of legitimate voters for every illegitimate one. Von Spakovsky also didn’t mention recent reports that have identified gaping security holes potentially exposing the personal information of the voters in states that participate. Those security concerns prompted a push in Illinois to withdraw from the crosscheck system.In an interview with HuffPost, von Spakovsky said he had doubts about the security hole reports. He also dismissed concerns about the program’s inaccuracy because he said election officials investigate further once Crosscheck flags a potential illegal voter. But Indiana is currently being sued for using Crosscheck to purge people from its voting rolls.During the panel discussion, von Spakovsky suggested the effort to withdraw from Crosscheck in Illinois was nefarious. “Why would they not want election officials to get rid of people registered in other states?” he said.Trump’s commission, formally called the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, held its second public meeting in September, but has not met since. Officials have indicated that its work is effectively on hold while the panel fights multiple lawsuits.Critics contend the commission is an effort to weaken confidence in American elections and set the stage for more restrictive voting laws. Jay Riestenberg, who follows ALEC for the watchdog group Common Cause, said Wednesday that he was concerned ALEC was beginning to do the same thing."

The expert, Arthur T. Anthony, concluded they were written by the same person.“The conclusion is that the signature and the inscription that appears before it is Roy Moore’s,” Allred said. “Why is that relevant? Because he said he didn’t know these women. And because his supporters have been saying that wasn’t his signature.”Last month, Moore’s attorneys implied the yearbook signature was not his and called for an expert to analyze it. Moore’s supporters have claimed the yearbook message and signature were forgeries.Earlier on Friday, Nelson told ABC’s “Good Morning America” that the date and location that appear directly below the inscription were, in fact, notes that she had added herself after Moore signed her yearbook. In the press conference, Allred said that Nelson had added the notes in order to remind herself who Moore was and when he signed her yearbook ― but that the rest of the inscription was Moore’s.The lawyer said they didn’t ask the expert to analyze the writing that Nelson had added.In another press conference later on Friday, Moore’s campaign responded by accusing Allred and Nelson of changing their story by not mentioning earlier that the date and location were not written by Moore. The campaign spokespeople also repeated demands that the yearbook be released so “an independent expert, not your expert,” could analyze the handwriting. They did not answer any reporter questions.Moore has repeatedly denied the allegations from multiple women who have said he pursued relationships with them when they were in their teens. Some of them have accused him of sexual assault.Nelson alleged in November that Moore had sexually assaulted her when she was 16 and he was 30, by groping her breasts and then trying to force her head toward his crotch while they were in his car. One week before the incident, Moore had left a note in her high school yearbook, according to Nelson.“To a sweeter, more beautiful girl, I could not say ‘Merry Christmas.’ Love, Roy Moore D.A,” read the note.Anthony, the handwriting expert, has worked for the FBI and is a certified forensic handwriting and document examiner qualified to testify as an expert in federal and state court, according to Allred. “It’s time to stop the misleading statements about Beverly, who had the courage to tell what she says is the truth about Roy Moore,” Allred said Friday. “We look forward to learning if Alabama voters will believe Moore’s accusers or ignore the evidence presented to them.” President Donald Trump has endorsed Moore, who is running for the Senate in a Dec. 12 special election. Despite the allegations, Moore has refused to drop out of the race."

Under current phase-out plans, only 27 percent of operating coal plants in the EU are due to close by 2030. The report suggests that by phasing out coal power entirely by 2030 to keep its climate pledges under the Paris agreement, the EU could also avoid €22 billion ($26 billion) in losses.Germany has the highest number of unprofitable plants. The report calculates it could save up to €12 billion ($14 billion) by closing them early.While Europe is still heavily reliant on coal ― it accounts for a quarter of all electricity production ― the report points to several factors that undermine the economic case for coal power, including falling renewable energy prices, rising carbon prices and government policies aimed at tackling air pollution.“Utilities can’t do much to stop this other than drop coal or lobby governments and hope they will bail them out,” said Matt Grey, co-author of the report and an analyst at Carbon Tracker.Seven European countries have already committed to ending coal power by 2030 ― Denmark, Finland, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and the U.K.But it’s not just a European phenomenon. More than 20 countries, including Canada and New Zealand, committed to phasing out coal at the United Nations climate meeting in Germany in November.Research from Greenpeace International this October found that more than 25 percent of the 1,675 companies that have owned or developed coal-fired power capacity since 2010 have left the coal business. Most of them were based in India, followed by China and the U.S.Despite President Donald Trump’s pro-coal rhetoric – including his plans to roll back the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, which aimed to limit power plant emissions – coal is slumping in the U.S. Around 30 gigawatts of coal capacity has been retired and coal power generation has declined by 13 percent in the U.S. over the last three years, according to a September report from Carbon Tracker.“The coal industry is on its way out because it is too expensive and too deadly,” Melinda Piece, legislative director of the Sierra Group, told HuffPost. “And that’s true no matter what Trump says or does. ... Trump should focus on ensuring coal workers have good-paying, family-sustaining jobs in the clean energy economy, not lying to them about a revival that won’t come.”For more content and to be part of the “This New World” community, join our Facebook Group.HuffPost’s “This New World” series is funded by Partners for a New Economy and the Kendeda Fund.

That is not hyperbole or exaggeration. The GOP tax scam is yet another assault on the health care of my patients and their families. All year long the Republicans have attacked the ACA and Medicaid with no regard for the millions of everyday people who will suffer.Let me tell you a little bit about my patients. They are children struggling with poverty just a few minutes away from where we’re standing right now. I worry about their survival because politicians in Congress are not prioritizing their basic human right of health care. Rather than extend CHIP and give my patients’ families peace of mind about their children’s coverage and health care, Republicans have prioritized huge, unnecessary tax cuts for the super rich.If the GOP tax scam becomes law, the federal deficit will explode. My patients will suffer even more because their federal government will tell them it can not afford basic necessities like health care, nutrition, and housing.But that is a lie. We can afford all of these things when we stop giving enormous, unnecessary tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations.The parents and grandparents of my patients are working hard, often at multiple jobs, just to make ends meet. Senator Hatch, they are not just lifting a finger to help themselves. They are lifting ALL their fingers. They are sweeping floors, serving coffee, stocking shelves, working security, pouring drinks, waiting tables and contributing to comforts and cleanliness for their fellow Americans. They are pinching every penny they earn, Senator Grassley, not spending it on booze, women and movies.Patients and families across the country need Congress to support Medicaid, Medicare and the Affordable Care Act. The Senate version of the GOP Tax Scam repeals the individual mandate to have health insurance. 13 million people will lose coverage, 5 million will lose Medicaid, and premiums will skyrocket for millions more. To make matters worse, the GOP tax scam causes enormous deficits that will trigger major cuts to Medicare: $25 billion in the next year and $400 billion in the next ten years.Patients will die. That is not an exaggeration. After the 2013 sequestration cuts, Medicare lost funding, and elderly cancer patients needing chemotherapy were turned away by doctors and hospitals. Under the GOP tax scam, Medicare loses, and so do patients and families. What does Congress want us to do? Is GoFundMe how they expect all but the super-rich to pay for health care?We do not need this tax reform. We need to reform our attitudes toward children and families with low incomes. We need to treat health care like the basic human right that it is, regardless of a person’s income or employment status. Doctors, patients and families have a very clear message for Congress: stop the GOP tax scam. We will not sacrifice health care for wealth care."

Kathryn Rossetter detailed the “horrific, demoralizing and abusive experience” of working with Hoffman in a guest column for The Hollywood Reporter, published Friday. The actress said she was just starting out in New York City when she land the role in the Broadway play. Hoffman hand-picked Rossetter for the part, which made him a “hero” in her eyes, she said ― until the two started working together. “One night in Chicago, I felt his hand up under my slip on the inside of my thighs. I was completely surprised and tried to bat him away while watching the stage for my cues,” the actress wrote, adding that the incidents happened nearly every show, for six to eight shows a week.Rossetter said she repeatedly begged Hoffman to stop, but he only became more aggressive. “One night he actually started to stick his fingers inside me. Night after night I went home and cried,” she wrote. “I withdrew and got depressed and did not have any good interpersonal relationships with the cast.”Rossetter said that Hoffman once lifted her costume ― which consisted of a slip and no bra ― over her head in front of the entire crew as a “surprise.” He also would put his hand over Rossetter’s breast whenever the two were asked to take pictures together. “My issue isn’t what he said; it’s what he did,” Rossetter wrote. “Along with the nightly sexual harassment, he eroded my confidence, my dignity. He humiliated and demeaned me. He robbed me of my joy in the experience and he left dirty fingerprints on my soul.” Read the rest of Rossetter’s account in The Hollywood Reporter. Last week, in her own guest column for The Hollywood Reporter, writer Anna Graham Hunter accused Hoffman of sexually harassing her during the TV adaptation of “Death of a Salesman” when she was a 17-year-old intern. Hunter said the actor repeatedly groped her and make inappropriate sexual comments. Writer and producer Wendy Riss Gatsiounis told Variety last week that Hoffman once asked her during a meeting if she had “ever been intimate with a man over 40.”Hoffman issued a response to Hunter, but declined to comment on Gatsiounis and Rossetter’s accounts. A representative for Hoffman declined to comment to HuffPost. “I have the utmost respect for women and feel terrible that anything I might have done could have put her in an uncomfortable situation,” he told The Hollywood Reporter. “I am sorry. It is not reflective of who I am.” "
52,POLITICS,A Terminally Ill Progressive Activist Confronted Jeff Flake About The Tax Bill On A Flight,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jeff-flake-confronted-by-progressive-activist-on-airplane_us_5a2ae93be4b073789f698d9f,"“For the rest of your life, you will be proud if you vote this bill down.”",2017-12-08,"Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who is due to retire in 2018, was confronted by Ady Barkan, a progressive leader with ALS, about his support for the tax bill.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a2aebed1900003b00cca3b2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A leading progressive activist with Lou Gehrig’s disease appealed to Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) to reconsider his support for the Republican tax bill during a flight to Phoenix on Thursday.“I need you to make your vote match your principles, senator. And for the rest of your life, you will be proud if you vote this bill down,” said Ady Barkan, founding director of the Fed Up campaign, a group backed by the Center for Popular Democracy that pushes the Federal Reserve to set monetary policy that favors workers.Flake, a fiscal conservative retiring in 2018, reportedly voted for the Senate tax bill on Saturday after receiving vague assurances from Republican leaders that Congress would soon act on providing permanent legal status to undocumented immigrants who arrived as children, commonly known as Dreamers.Barkan ― a 33-year-old who was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig’s disease, also called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, about a year ago ― was returning home to California by way of Phoenix on Thursday night after days of protesting the tax bill in the nation’s capital. Due to the disease’s progression, Barkan now requires the assistance of a cane and his speech is softer and more slurred.He saw Flake on the flight to Phoenix when he was boarding and invited him to have a discussion with him about the bill.Flake obliged and the pair engaged in a lengthy, civil debate over tax policy, economic growth, the debt, immigration reform, the Children’s Health Insurance Program and congressional procedure. Liz Jaff, a progressive political strategist traveling with Barkan, taped the entire exchange and posted it to Twitter in eight parts.Barkan, who lives in Santa Barbara, California, with his wife and 18-month-old son, argued that the tax bill was personal for him, since the budget deficits it would generate would trigger congressional “paygo” rules requiring automatic spending cuts. The activist worried that given the authority to do so through paygo rules, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney might choose to cut Social Security Disability Insurance benefits that Barkan is likely to need as his condition worsens. Mulvaney has indeed boasted of prevailing on President Donald Trump to include cuts to the program is his budget proposal.“What should I tell my son ― or what should you tell my son ― if you pass this bill and he cuts funding for disability and I can’t get a benefit later?” Barkan asked Flake.Barkan made a similar argument on Tuesday outside the office of Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.). Barkan was one of 133 demonstrators arrested for protesting the tax bill at the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday.Congress always ends up waiving paygo rules, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) have made assurances that this time won’t be any different, Flake told Barkan.“The leadership in Congress is saying one thing, and oftentimes, doing something else,” Barkan responded. “So are you supposed to trust them? Is my wife supposed to trust them that they are not gonna implement paygo when it’s the law of the land?” Later in the conversation, Barkan asked why Flake would not withhold his vote for the tax bill unless there was action on a bill providing Dreamers permanent status in the country.Flake denied that the White House had offered him an “ironclad guarantee” on making permanent the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, which would allow Dreamers to stay without fear of deportation. To insist on the provision as a condition of his vote would not be “prudent,” Flake argued. “I’m working with the administration and with leadership on this, but I’m not going to say publicly, ‘Here’s my ultimatum on this or that.’”However, the junior senator from Arizona said he had insisted on a longer phase-out period for the full “expensing” tax deduction allowing corporations to deduct the entire value of new equipment purchases from their taxes.In an October Senate speech announcing his forthcoming retirement, Flake delivered a stinging rebuke to Trump in which he denounced the “appalling features of our current politics.” “There may not be a place for a Republican like me in the current Republican Party,” Flake said at the time. The speech revisited themes Flake touched on in his August book, Conscience of a Conservative: A Rejection of Destructive Politics and a Return to Principle.In one last attempt to persuade Flake to vote against the final tax cut bill, Barkan tried to appeal to the ideals Flake articulated in the speech, and Flake’s professed disgust with the rushed process that had created the bill. “Why not take your stand now?” Barkan implored him. “You can be an American hero. You really could ― if the votes match the speech.”“Think about the legacy that you will have for my son and your grandchildren, if you take your principles and turn them into votes,” he added. “You could save my life. Please, please remember this conversation.”Flake did not say whether the conversation would change his vote.

The Saudis, for their part, got an equivalent not-quite-embassy in Iran. Suddenly, two regional powerhouses whose rivalry had caused hundreds of thousands of deaths and untold global instability seemed a little closer to peace ― courtesy of Switzerland, which announced on Oct. 25 that it would represent Saudi interests in Iran and vice versa.The Swiss mandate is narrow. It only covers consular services, as a Swiss official was quick to remind HuffPost. The official said the foreign ministry had no further comment on the policy.But when it comes to the possibility of a rapprochement between Iran and Saudi Arabia, even the smallest steps matter. Despite the furor over U.S. President Donald Trump’s upending of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process this week, the defining fault line in the Middle East today is not between supporters of Palestine and those of Israel. The fight that will decide the Mideast’s future is that between Iran and its many opponents — most importantly Saudi Arabia.“They are locked in a zero-sum power contestation,” said Randa Slim, a prominent peace-building expert at the Middle East Institute, a think tank. “Iran says it will never leave the Middle East” ― that is, accept a marginal role in regional affairs ― “including the Arab region, since it is from this region. Saudi Arabia says Iran has no role to play in the Arab region since it is not an Arab country. The level of tensions that exists today between the two countries is one of the highest I have witnessed.”Peace in the region depends on effective diplomacy between Riyadh and Tehran. Years of attempts to achieve that goal have yielded a little progress and a lot of frustration — but experts say that given regional turmoil and the two countries’ inevitably intertwined futures, even limited proof of success shows it’s worth trying.The good news is that the Swiss channel is just one of multiple attempts. Since autumn 2015, Western officials have paid increasing attention to a Europe-based effort to bring together a group of influential Saudis and Iranians on a fairly regular basis twice a year.“Regardless of political tensions, there is always a core in both countries — in academia, but also in the think tank scene and in the security establishment — that is interested in having some forms of communication,” said Adnan Tabatabai, the head of the Center for Applied Research in Partnership with the Orient in Bonn, Germany. Known as a Track II dialogue because it does not include government (Track I) figures from either side, the exercise is a partnership, backed by the German government, between CARPO and the EastWest Institute, a nonpartisan American think tank.The process is extraordinarily sensitive. The dialogue’s organizers do not reveal the names of the Saudis, Iranians and others who attend (usually European experts on the region). Nor do they say where the meetings are held. It’s understood that the participants might share information or analysis with policymakers, Tabatabai said, but there have not been official inquiries from any side. The priority is maintaining trust, confidentiality and good faith ― which involves expectations like the Chatham House rule that insights from the conversations can be shared externally, but only if they are free of identifying information about which individual or institution they came from.“A real success is already if you have a continuous channel where people of knowledge from both sides come together to discuss current developments and do so in a civilized manner where discussions are frank yet respectful, and where you actually throughout those meetings have coffee breaks, lunches, dinners where these people then simply mingle and socialize and humanize each other,” Tabatabai said. “What we regard as a success is that throughout the past two and a half years we have been able to bring participants from both countries together six times and have had a continuous conversation which builds on the previous rounds.”After four of the meetings, the organizers have released brief reports to share the perspectives and concerns the Saudis and Iranians brought. They also conduct briefings in capitals around the world. Officials see the dialogue as useful because it sustains relationships between fairly consistent groups and deliberately covers a range of issues. Among them so far are the refugee crisis, environmental concerns, the threat posed by Islamic State militants, and plans to reduce the two countries’ reliance on oil revenue.Simply meeting face-to-face regularly and becoming familiar with each other’s methods can make it easier for both sides to be honest, according to Richard Nephew, a former top State Department official who participated in the broadest U.S. talks with Iran in decades as part of the Obama administration’s nuclear diplomacy. He recalled something similar occurring during those negotiations. “In those initial conversations, the dimensions of what you could say and what you could float were profoundly different than a year and a half in,” Nephew told HuffPost.And committing to a dialogue even as Saudi Arabia and Iran have cut off official diplomatic ties and ratcheted up their rhetoric sends an important signal ― that both sides take the talks seriously, and that some true confidence has developed.“It’s really impressive how [Tabatabai and his team have] managed to maintain these exchanges even after all of the terrible events of the last three years,” a Western government official told HuffPost.Tabatabai’s definition of failure is a situation where no one is even able to start a conversation. That prospect seems more likely in a year in which Saudi Arabia’s crown prince called Iran’s leader “the new Hitler” and Iran-aligned rebels in Yemen almost successfully destroyed the main Saudi airport. The report on the last workshop, held this past April, noted that it was more difficult than before to secure balanced participation on both sides.The increasingly hard-line Saudi position ― which the kingdom says is an appropriate response to Iranian assertiveness following its gains from the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 ― is a particular problem.“Saudi officials have decided to go all in contesting Iranian influence in their backyard. They will not abandon this strategy anytime soon,” Slim, who runs her own broad regional dialogue at the quasi-official Track 1.5 level, said. She noted that even during less assertive periods, Saudi Arabia has been wary of engagement through nonofficial channels. “The Iranians, always they have shown readiness,” said Seyed Houssain Mousavian, a former Iranian diplomat who worked on engaging the Saudis. “During the late King Abdullah’s era, Riyadh was ready to hear what the Iranians say, but no more in [current King] Salman’s era.”Mousavian, now a researcher at Princeton University, sees the growing reluctance on Saudi Arabia’s part as a result of anxiety about the nuclear deal and Iran’s outreach to the West. For years, Saudi Arabia has sought to have its U.S. partner serve as a balancing force in the region, while Iran, skeptical of Washington’s intentions and more confident in its own abilities, has pushed to shape the Middle East on a bilateral basis, according to a 2009 study from the RAND think tank.The Trump administration’s chumminess with the Saudis, and its determination to challenge Iran, means there’s presently little American pressure to reconcile the two powers ― though there’s still an acknowledgement that in the long run, a reconciliation is essential. Asked about the new Swiss policy, a State Department official said: “We have seen these reports. We continue to urge leaders across the region to take affirmative steps to calm tensions.”Some observers feel the U.S. could do more even if the administration doesn’t want to. A top congressional aide working on Capitol Hill efforts to promote Saudi-Iran dialogue told HuffPost there’s frustration in progressive circles that former Obama aides are not more vocal, particularly to say their experience suggests Iran is willing to engage with its adversaries.But there’s no telling when positions might soften on their own. Some analysts believe that when the Saudi king-to-be thinks he has fully consolidated his control and boosted Saudi prestige abroad, he may modify his tone and attempt compromise. Experts say Riyadh and Tehran have pragmatically kept their governments ready to launch such engagement at fairly short notice.“There’s a number of well-placed Saudis who know their counterparts in Iran very well, not through [Tabatabai’s] stuff and not through the Swiss,” the Western official said.Slim noted that the two governments have communicated surreptitiously for years through U.S., Swiss, Iraqi, Emirati and Kuwaiti officials ― most recently in a Kuwaiti mediation that “reached an advanced stage” but is now “on hold if not finished.” And despite impressions that sectarian differences might preclude open engagement, as most Saudis follow the Sunni school of Islam and most Iranians adhere to Shiite ideology, analysts say religious differences are not decisive. Probably more important are the differences in political systems, with Iran supporting and exporting the idea of a quasi-democratic theocracy, which the Saudis see as a threat to absolute monarchies like their own.Mousavian and Nephew, Iranian and American diplomats respectively, both told HuffPost the key to successful talks is high-level interest. In the 1990s, reformist Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and then-Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah wanted to defuse tensions lingering from Saudi police scuffles with Iranians during the Hajj ceremony in Saudi Arabia in 1987, the Lebanese Civil War and other issues. Rafsanjani sent Mousavian to the kingdom as a special envoy in the summer of 1996.“We discussed security concerns, interferences, very, very honestly, openly, frankly. We talked about the minorities ― the Shiite minority in Saudi, the Sunni minority in Iran ― and mutual suspicions about interferences in our internal affairs,” Mousavain said. “Ultimately, our package was a very comprehensive package that led to good Saudi-Iran relations for almost a decade.”“The two leaders were really positive, both of them,” he noted. “We were recognizing every concern. We were not fighting. We were saying, ‘If this is your problem, what is the solution?’”“The first real hurdle we had to overcome [in the Iran nuclear talks] is knowing that they were speaking on behalf of their government,” Nephew said. Otherwise dialogue can be useless, even with good intentions. “Saying the words ‘regional dialogue’ is a little bit like saying grace when you sit down at a table,” he added.For Tabatabai, whose dialogue has identified a host of problems the Saudis and Iranians will have to cooperate on at some point, it’s about waiting for that perfect moment.He believes political reconciliation at the highest level will happen sooner or later ― and when it does, he said, his project wants to ensure it can be deeply rooted in both societies “to continue these expert discussions on the social level.”"

Arnold, the man who made the discovery, told The Associated Press on April 22, 1960. “Then I saw it was the body of a girl.”Garza had been missing for six days. She was last seen alive the day before Easter 1960, when she went to Sacred Heart Catholic Church for what would be her final confession.The Sarasota Journal referred to Garza as a “dark-haired beauty queen.” The newspaper reported she had been a frequent entrant in local beauty contests and had been crowned Miss South Texas in 1958. The young woman had also reportedly been named “band sweetheart” while attending McAllen High School and was named “senior class sweetheart” while at Pan America College. She had been working as a school teacher at the time of her death.An autopsy determined Garza was likely killed the day of her disappearance. The young woman, the medical examiner told police, had been brutally beaten and raped while in a coma, and suffocated.Questioned by police, Feit, then a 27-year-old Roman Catholic priest, told authorities he had heard a confession by Garza the night she disappeared. Interest in Feit piqued when detectives later drained a section of the canal where Garza’s body was discovered and found an Eastman Kodaslide viewer that belonged to him, Texas Monthly reported.The investigation further narrowed when authorities spoke with a 20-year-old college student who claimed Feit had attacked her roughly three weeks before Garza was killed.When police questioned Feit about the incident, he reportedly denied any involvement. Still, he was arrested on a charge of assault with intent to commit rape. When the case went to trial the following year, it ended in a hung jury. Feit ultimately pleaded no contest to a reduced charge of aggravated assault, a misdemeanor. He was fined $500 for the offense, The Dallas Morning News reported.Feit, who left the priesthood in the 1970s, eventually married and became a father. He worked for several years as an administrator and spokesman for a Catholic charity, the Rio Grande Valley’s KRGV‑TV reported.The murder case was all but forgotten when, in 2002, former monk Dale Tacheny told police Feit had confessed in 1963 to killing Garza. However, when then-Hidalgo County District Attorney Rene Guerra presented the case to a grand jury, they declined to indict Feit.The case went cold again and remained relatively untouched until 2016, when newly elected District Attorney Ricardo Rodriguez presented the case to a second grand jury, who decided to indict Feit.Jurors this week heard testimony from Tacheny, now 88, who recounted how Feit told him about the killing in 1963.“He put the young lady in a bathtub,” Tacheny testified. “As he was leaving, the young lady said, ‘I cannot breathe, I cannot breathe.’ Then he left.”Feit’s attorney, O. Rene Flores, attempted to convince jurors that there was no physical evidence linking his client to the crime. Flores questioned why Tacheny and another witness waited decades to come forward with testimony.Assistant District Attorney Michael Garza, who has no relation to the victim, presented evidence in court that church officials suspected Feit had killed Irene Garza, but were afraid a case would harm the church’s reputation.“This is a case about betrayal, murder and a cover-up,” Michael Garza told jurors, according to Courthouse News. ”[Feit] was a wolf in priest’s clothing.”Feit was reportedly emotionless when he heard the verdict read in court Thursday.The jury began hearing evidence in the penalty phase Friday morning. Feit faces a sentence of up to life imprisonment.Send David Lohr an email or follow him on Facebook and Twitter. "

It’s not entirely clear yet what the commission plans to do with the information, but officials have expressed interest in comparing the voter information against various federal databases ― such as a Department of Homeland Security list of non-citizens ― to try to identify people who are on the rolls illegally. Experts are skeptical that that would be a reliable way to find voter fraud, which several studies have shown is not a widespread problem.Most of the signers of the brief were former Obama administration officials, including James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence. They filed the brief in a lawsuit against the commission warning that compiling a vast set of personal information on all Americans was extremely dangerous and would create a “treasure trove” for hackers and likely be targeted by hostile nations. DHS has determined Russian hackers scanned voting systems in 21 states during the 2016 election.“A database that contains large volumes of [personally identifiable information] is an extremely attractive target for cyberattacks. Hackers seek to exploit this type of information for a number of reasons, ranging from ordinary criminal profiteering (e.g., to commit identity theft or to sell the information on the black market for others to commit identity theft) to intelligence collection by hostile nation states or non-state actors. The bigger the database, the greater the payoff from a potential breach,” they wrote in the brief.The commission has not been consistent in saying how it plans to store the information. It initially said it would store the data on a secure Department of Defense server, but after that raised legal questions, it reversed course and said only the White House would handle the information and store the data.The intelligence officials said it was unclear what safeguards were in place to protect the data in the White House system.“This new platform is effectively being tested for the first time through the ingestion of millions of data points about American voters. Additionally, the White House’s Information Technology staff does not have the same technical resources at its disposal to maintain large-scale databases as the Department of Defense,” the brief says.Charles Christopher Herndon, the director for White House information technology, has said only a limited number of staff would have contact with the server, but the security experts said vast resources were needed to work on a system that is frequently the subject of cyberattacks.“There is no indication that the Commission has taken the appropriate additional measures, and allocated the necessary additional resources, to fortify its database against these risks,” the brief says. “Given that attempted attacks against White House unclassified networks are regularly reported in the media (and therefore should be well known to the Commission), this suggests an overall lack of attentiveness to the magnitude and gravity of the cybersecurity risks posed.”In addition to Clapper, the former officials who signed the brief included Andrew Grotto, a former senior director of cybersecurity policy at the White House from 2016 until 2017; Nancy Libin, the chief privacy officer at the Department of Justice from 2009 until 2012; and Paul Rosenzweig, a former deputy assistant secretary for policy at DHS from 2006 to 2009.In an October court filing, the commission disclosed it had received data from 19 states. Andrew Kossack, a federal official charged with running the operations of the commission, said in a different legal filing that the commission’s staff wasn’t currently doing anything with the data because it faced multiple lawsuits.The Public Interest Legal Foundation, which is run by J. Christian Adams, a member of the probe who is close to Kobach, suggested in a tweet the security concerns in the brief were overblown.The brief was filed in support of a lawsuit brought by Common Cause, a left-leaning watchdog group. The suit argues the commission violated the 1974 Privacy Act, which says agencies can “maintain no record describing how any individual exercises rights guaranteed by the First Amendment unless expressly authorized by statute or by the individual about whom the record is maintained or unless pertinent to and within the scope of an authorized law enforcement activity.” In August, a federal judge denied a request by Common Cause to halt the commission’s work while the litigation was pending."

On Monday, Trump announced a plan to reduce the 1.3-million-acre Bears Ears National Monument by 85 percent and cut Grand Staircase-Escalante’s 1.9 million acres to half its size. The retail company took a stand that day by using its website to bring awareness to the cuts, putting “The President Stole Your Land” on its home page. “The Administration’s unlawful actions betray our shared responsibility to protect iconic places for future generations and represent the largest elimination of protected land in American history,” Patagonia President and CEO Rose Marcario said in a statement. “We’ve fought to protect these places since we were founded and now we’ll continue that fight in the courts.” Yvon Chouinard, Patagonia’s billionaire founder, called the Trump administration “evil” in his defense of the lands. I think it’s a shame that only 4 percent of American lands are national parks,” Chouinard told CNN. “Costa Rica’s got 10 percent. Chile will now have way more parks than we have. We need more, not less. This government is evil, and I’m not going to sit back and let evil win.”While past presidents have reduced the size of national monuments, there is no legal precedent that establishes a president’s authority to make such changes. In a May analysis, four legal scholars concluded Congress, not the president, has the sole legal power to rescind or weaken protections for monuments designated under the Antiquities Act of 1906.“Sixteen presidents have used the Antiquities Act to designate 157 national monuments since 1906 to preserve our unique and treasured places from destruction,” Patagonia said in a statement. “President Trump’s proclamation is the first time any president has attempted to abolish a monument established by a previous president and amounts to the largest elimination of protected areas in American history.” Patagonia is joining a number of other plaintiffs in a complaint filed in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, the company told HuffPost in a statement. The coalition consists of Patagonia Works, Utah Diné Bikéyah, Friends of Cedar Mesa, Archaeology Southwest, Conservation Lands Foundation, Access Fund, the Society for Vertebrate Paleontology and the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Other outdoor companies, such as North Face and REI, have spoken out against Trump’s reduction of the federal lands as well. North Face announced that the company would donate $100,000 to the nonprofit Friends of Cedar Mesa, one of the lawsuit plaintiffs, toward developing a Bears Ears Education Center. “Beyond outdoor recreation, these lands are vitally important to the past and future of five Native American tribes that advocate tirelessly for their protection,” North Face President Arne Arens wrote in a Quartz op-ed. “Visitors to these places come face-to-face with 1,000-year-old cliff dwellings, ancient rock carvings and countless other signs that it was once home to a thriving civilization—a part of our collective history.”REI outdoor apparel and gear company also used its home page on Monday to raise awareness of Trump’s reduction of public lands. The retailer called the administration’s choice a threat to the $887 billion outdoor industry.“REI will not retreat from our strong belief that there is common ground in the outdoors,” the company said in a statement. “We will continue to pursue bipartisan support to protect public lands and prevent death by a thousand cuts. REI members can be assured that we will honor our shared passion for our public lands, dedicating time and resources to leaving them healthier for future generations.” "

The measure will now go to President Donald Trump’s desk for his signature.In the House, Democrats waited for Republicans to put up the votes required for passage before some of their more vulnerable members supported the two-week funding extension.Republican leaders huddled around a computer on the GOP side monitoring who was voting for the bill, with Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) signaling to Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) how many more votes Republicans needed to pass the bill. A number of Freedom Caucus members ended up voting for the bill, though of the 18 Republicans in opposition, 12 are members of the Freedom Caucus.The two-week continuing resolution will allow lawmakers to work out another spending deal before members leave for Christmas break. Republicans and Democrats are currently negotiating over the spending numbers for defense and nondefense for an even larger appropriations agreement.Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) joined Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) at the White House on Thursday afternoon to discuss the way forward on a spending deal with the president and vice president.“We had a productive conversation on a wide variety of issues. Nothing specific has been agreed to, but discussions continue,” Schumer and Pelosi said in a joint statement after the meeting.Once Republicans and Democrats agree to the overall budget numbers, appropriators will take roughly two weeks to write spending bills based on those levels for the rest of the fiscal year, which goes through September.Recent offers between the two sides have not been that far off, but there still isn’t an agreement on the spending levels or what will be included in the eventual deal. Democrats (and some Republicans) are looking to include a number of other legislative priorities ― Obamacare subsidies, a reauthorization of the Children’s Health Insurance Program, as well as a fix for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals immigration program ― and negotiations on those items could be just as tricky as the spending agreement.But lawmakers are still confident they’ll be able to sort out a deal to avoid a government shutdown, both at the end of December and in January.This post has been updated with the Senate vote."

The big difference is that the two main figures of the story, the Virgin Mary and the Baby Jesus, are both inside a small rubber dinghy, a vessel similar to the rickety boats used by refugees and migrants during dangerous trips across the Mediterranean Sea from Africa and the Middle East.Castenaso mayor Stefano Sermenghi chose to include the boat in the manger scene in order to draw attention to the plight of migrants, ANSA reports. The municipality also plans to use an image of this Nativity scene for its Christmas postcards. “Many people in Italy open their mouths, but then nobody does anything to provide a positive welcome to those who arrive,” the mayor said, according to The Local.The decision didn’t sit well with some residents. Monsignor Ernesto Vecchi, auxiliary bishop emeritus of Bologna, told a local paper that while the boat is a good reminder of the need for hospitality, tradition calls for Jesus to be placed in a manger ― and not on a boat. “The nucleus of a Nativity scene calls for the child in swaddling clothing inside a manger,” he told Il Resto del Carlino, according to a translation from ANSA. “And this must be fully complied with.” The United Nations High Commissioner of Refugees (UNHCR) reports that sea arrivals to Italy have sharply decreased in recent months. But the dangerous route is still in use. In 2017, more than 160,000 people arrived in Italy by crossing the Mediterranean Sea. More than 3,000 are estimated to be dead or missing after trying to complete the journey.Pope Francis has often connected the Christmas story to the migrant crisis, reminding his followers that Jesus’ family had to flee to Egypt when the child was a baby to escape persecution.Last year, the Vatican’s Nativity scene included a traditional Maltese fishing boat that was meant to remind visitors of the “the sad and tragic reality of migrants on boats making their way toward Italy.” In October, Pope Francis visited a refugee center near Bologna that is home to about 1,000 asylum-seekers, many of whom arrived in the country by sea. “If we look on our neighbors without mercy, we risk that even God will look on us without mercy,” he said during the visit."

CVS, a PBM, just bought up Aetna insurance, which could either help or hurt consumers, but limits consumer choice in an already-restrictive market-place.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a288ad9150000138785bee4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Just how big is “Big Pharma”? Over half of Americans are on some kind of prescription medication. A study of 10 years’ worth of medical and health policy, published in JAMA last year, found that the U.S. spent $858 per capita on drugs in 2013, more than twice that of other industrialized countries.It gets even bigger when you consider all the intermediaries – the FDA, Pharmacy Benefits Managers (PBMs), insurance companies, physicians – between you and the pharmaceutical company that affect what you pay for a given drug. Mergers are common in the industry and occasionally get blocked by anti-trust legislation, as in Aetna insurance’s failed attempt to buy up fellow-insurer Humana Inc earlier in 2017. Now, Aetna is about to be swallowed up in one of the largest health care acquisitions ever, in a move that befuddles those in an already-chaotic industry.Aetna insures more the 46 million people in the U.S. – myself included. It, like many insurance companies in 2017, restricts benefits to certain providers and only covers prescriptions filled through certain pharmacies. CVS pharmacies, a PBM which claims to serve 5 million customers every day, just bought Aetna in a merger for $69 billion.Which leaves me and many other customers wondering: How is it legal for the company that sells me my meds to own the company that is supposed to help me afford them?Supposedly, a combined insurer and PBM will actually be more powerful in negotiating prices down from pharmaceutical companies – but a PBM can simply pocket these savings and has little incentive to pass them down to consumers. Clearly not a conflict of interest.This announcement comes just a few weeks after President Trump designated Alex Azar, former U.S.-division president of pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly, his pick for Secretary of Health and Human Services. You know, the position which oversees the FDA, which in turn regulates the pharmaceutical industry? Again, absolutely no conflict of interest here.You could argue that as a former pharmaceutical tycoon, Azar knows better than anyone else the ins and outs of the industry. I can’t deny his expertise, but I’m skeptical of his dedication to consumers.Eli Lilly is actually one of three pharmaceutical companies charged in a January class action suit for price-fixing insulin at hundreds of dollars per vial. Oh, and January is the same month Azar stepped down as president of the U.S. division of the company.Insulin is one of those drugs that, if you’re a type-1 diabetic, you will die without. Many people have.If you haven’t heard the name Shane Patrick Boyle, you’ve probably heard of the man who died because his GoFundMe was $50 short of the $750 he needed for his next month of insulin. Boyle had moved to take care of his dying mother, lacked insurance or a job and was waiting for his ACA application to be approved. He died from the diabetic ketoacidosis he developed from trying to make what insulin he had lost longer than it could.Boyle’s GoFundMe garnered him much more press than most victims of the pharmaceutical industry, but his story has yet to appear in most major newspapers. Most stories of life-and-death struggles with pharmaceutical prices go untold, but there are plenty of them; 2012 research from the ADA suggests that there are 2 million adults under 65 who suffer from diabetes and are uninsured.As pretty much anyone who has received medical care knows, drugs aren’t the only treatments that are overpriced. Many hospitals mark-up service costs by as much as 1,000 percent, according to a 2015 study published in Health Affairs. The burden of these mark-ups falls disproportionately upon the uninsured, those forced to use out-of-network providers, and insurers like worker’s comp who are required to provide full compensation.I realize I’ve just thrown a lot of numbers at you, but I wish I had more. One reason it is so difficult to regulate the pharmaceutical industry is a lack of transparency – there is almost no published data tracking actual R&D costs and pricing decisions for drugs. This is, in part, due to the fact that drug prices are often based on what is sustainable and profitable in a given drug market, not the actual costs of development.Maybe the CVS-Aetna merger will turn out to be a sheep in wolves’ clothing, but I have about as much faith in CVS passing on negotiated savings to consumers as I have in Comcast’s pledge to provide equitable access if net neutrality gets killed. Corporations, especially those in extremely lucrative industries, have been proven again and again to act in their own self-interest up to and sometimes beyond the limits of the law. When consumers’ hands are as tied as they are in the pharmaceutical market, we must demand better of the government institutions designed to protect our interests in these markets.We pump more money into our health care system than any other country and still have over $40 billion in uncompensated health care costs in hospitals, 28 million uninsured citizens, and fixed drug prices that make life itself a luxury reserved for the wealthy. We need universal, affordable coverage and stronger anti-trust and anti-collusion enforcement. Cracking down on corporate greed and supporting preventative care – overlooked by many in an effort to save money, which unfortunately allows minor, treatable issues to become severe and expensive or impossible to treat – will help improve treatment access and reduce uncompensated care costs, a happy medium politicians on both sides of the aisle should be able to agree on."

I still have my ‘Dark Angel’ fans, and Hollywood is finally allowing women to star more in action franchises, which is a passion of mine.”The actress-turned-entrepreneur launched The Honest Company, which offers household products that are safe and environmentally responsible, in 2012. Alba has devoted much of her energy to expanding the brand, and by the summer of 2016 the company was valued at $1.7 billion. The star has been vocal about the difficulty of finding roles that stir her passions. In 2014, she told HuffPost she’d been offered many one-dimensional parts throughout her career but she felt encouraged by leading ladies like Jennifer Lawrence, Angelina Jolie and Charlize Theron who had starred in box office hits. “I think there’s more opportunities maybe than there were before for female leads in film versus just being ‘the girl,’ and I think it’s a matter of us women choosing to take on those roles,” Alba said at the time. “Maybe you get paid more money to play the ‘hot girl’ that really doesn’t have anything to do, but it’s not going to be a role that’s going to make a difference in the perception of women’s roles in movies,” she added. “So maybe do that gritty independent [film] that you may have to produce and put together, but you get to play a lead and you get to play a dominant, complicated, multi-dimensional character.”This February, Alba said her heritage also made it difficult for her to land roles she wanted. The star told PopSugar’s “Pretty Unfiltered” the entertainment industry tried to box her in. “They couldn’t figure out my ethnicity,” Alba, whose father is of Mexican descent, said. “They were like, ‘You’re not Latin enough to play a Latina, and you’re not Caucasian enough to play the leading lady, so you’re going to be the ‘exotic’ one.’ Whatever that was.”"

The attacks targeted Hamas, the Islamist militant group that rules Gaza, and used both tank and air power.Residents in the Gaza Strip reported that there were no casualties from the strikes, according to Reuters.The Israeli strikes were apparently in retaliation for rocket attacks from Gaza earlier in the day. The Israeli military said two rockets were launched toward Israel, but fell short of their intended destination and landed inside Gaza. A third rocket reportedly did reach Israeli territory, but landed in an open area and caused no harm or damage.An Islamist militant group called the Al-Tawheed Brigades took credit for firing the rockets at Israel. The Israeli Defense Forces issued a statement holding Hamas accountable for the attack, as Israel considers the group responsible for any actions coming from Gaza.The attacks come one day after President Donald Trump controversially announced that the United States would recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and begin the process of moving the U.S. Embassy there. The move sparked international opposition and prompted Palestinian leaders to call for three days of protest.Demonstrators in cities including Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Ramallah rallied against Trump’s shift in policy, some burning American flags and photos of the U.S. president. The protesters also clashed with Israeli security forces firing tear gas and stun grenades, as well as rubber bullets and live ammunition.At least 31 people were injured in the demonstrations, according to Israeli medics, including one person who was in critical condition.A lengthy list of U.S. allies, regional powers and Palestinian politicians warned Trump against recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital in the lead-up to his announcement on Wednesday, saying that it would inflame tensions and provoke violence. Although the decision’s long-term effects on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and attempts at peace remain unclear, the announcement has caused an immediate wave of unrest.The Palestinian Authority called for a general strike in Palestinian cities as a result of Trump’s declaration, while Hamas has taken a harder line and is advocating for a new Palestinian uprising.Both Israelis and Palestinians lay claim to Jerusalem, although Israel has retained control over the city since 1967. The final status of the city is one of the most sensitive issues in terms of finding a negotiated settlement between Israelis and Palestinians, and most United Nations states don’t recognize Israeli sovereignty over the city while the peace process is ongoing."

I cannot explain where they came from,” he said.The younger Conyers, a hedge fund manager in Detroit, was arrested in Los Angeles in February after his girlfriend suffered knife cuts during an argument, according to documents obtained by NBC News. He confirmed the arrest in an interview with The New York Times, but said the incident did not lead to any charges, as “the authorities did not see any need to proceed further.”“She says I stabbed her, which makes no sense,” Conyers told the outlet. “I didn’t do this. She and I had a verbal altercation and that escalated. She pulled the knife on me. She was chasing me. I tried to take it from her. There was a struggle. I pinned her to the wall. She kept swinging and she cut herself.”NBC reports the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office cited a “lack of independent witnesses” to corroborate the charges after both parties called 911 to report the other.Conyers’ girlfriend obtained a restraining order against him after the incident, which expires in March 2018. Conyers told the Times they had not spoken in several months.After receiving his father’s endorsement, the younger Conyers told the Times on Wednesday that he still wasn’t sure if he would pursue the seat.“I didn’t ask my dad to say that I was going to run because I don’t know if I am going to run,” Conyers said. “I was extremely caught off guard by his endorsement.

At the time of the trial, Swift said she asked for a symbolic $1 in damages because she hoped it would serve “as an example to other women who may resist publicly reliving similar outrageous and humiliating acts.” Many people celebrated Swift’s win as a victory for all women who have been sexually harassed. Sending the singer a coin featuring a Native American woman rather than a $1 bill was a somewhat sarcastic reaction to that rhetoric, Mueller previously indicated to the AP. Time magazine named “Silence Breakers” its Person of the Year on Wednesday. Swift was featured on the cover, alongside other women who have spoken out this year about sexual harassment and other forms of misconduct. Swift also talked with the magazine about her countersuit against Mueller.“I figured that if he would be brazen enough to assault me under these risky circumstances and high stakes, imagine what he might do to a vulnerable, young artist if given the chance,” she said."

The program, known as HUD-VASH, provides vets with case management and clinical services from the VA and rental assistance from the Department of Housing and Urban Development.The VA’s plan had been to funnel money allocated for the program to local VA hospitals to use however they saw fit. The hospitals only had to show they were “dealing with homelessness” in some way, Politico reported. VA officials reportedly shared news of the plan with advocates and state officials in a Friday call ― but “anger exploded,” said Politico. Advocates accused the VA of “putting at risk the lives of men and women who’ve served this country.”Hours after Politico’s report was published on Wednesday, The Washington Post revealed that the VA appeared to be second-guessing its decision, first described in an internal VA memo circulated in September.VA Secretary David Shulkin said in a statement to the Post that “there will be absolutely no change in the funding to support our homeless programs.”“Over the next six months, I will solicit input from our local VA leaders and external stakeholders on how best to target our funding to the geographical areas that need it most,” Shulkin said.The reversal came after a torrent of criticism from advocates and lawmakers from both sides of the aisle.“The VA is taking its foot off the pedal,” Leon Winston, an executive at Swords to Plowshares, an organization that supports homeless vets in San Francisco, told Politico this week. In November, all members of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on military construction, veterans affairs and related agencies signed a letter, shared online by the Post, “strongly” urging to VA to pause any action on its plan so that its “intention, consequences and implementation” could be better understood. “The shift [of funds] could have tremendous unintended consequences,” the senators cautioned. Even former first daughter Chelsea Clinton chimed in this week to criticize the proposal.HUD-VASH is the largest homeless veteran housing program in the country. Since 2008, more than 111,000 homeless veterans have found permanent housing thanks to the program, according to a 2017 report compiled by the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans. “Nearly 40,000 veterans experiencing homelessness on any given night and HUD-VASH plays a big role in ending veteran homelessness and decreasing that number, especially for the chronically homeless,” Randy Brown, a spokesman for the organization, told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette last month.

It does not recognize Israel’s right to exist and its suicide bombings helped spearhead the last intifada, from 2000 to 2005.“We have given instruction to all Hamas members and to all its wings to be fully ready for any new instructions or orders that may be given to confront this strategic danger that threatens Jerusalemand threatens Palestine,” said Haniyeh.“United Jerusalem is Arab and Muslim, and it is the capital of the state of Palestine, all of Palestine,” he said, referring to territory including Israel as well as the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip and the Israeli-occupied West Bank.Haniyeh called on Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to withdraw from peacemaking with Israel and on Arabs to boycott the Trump administration.“It should be announced that the so-called peace agreement was buried, once and for all, and that there is nothing called a partner for the Palestinians in peace,” he said.Trump reversed decades of U.S. policy to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, upsetting the Arab world and Western allies alike.

He criticized those who deliberately took his words out of context “for their own toxic, political purposes.” MSNBC President Phil Griffin, in his own statement, defended Seder. Of the network’s earlier decision, Griffin said: “Sometimes you just get one wrong — and that’s what happened here.”“We made our initial decision for the right reasons ― because we don’t consider rape to be a funny topic to be joked about,” Griffin said. “But we’ve heard the feedback, and we understand the point Sam was trying to make in that tweet was actually in line with our values, even though the language was not. Sam will be welcome on our air going forward.” Seder came under fire for an old tweet that made a satirical joke about filmmaker Roman Polanski, who fled the United States after pleading guilty to statutory rape. The tweet was recently unearthed by Mike Cernovich, a Pizzagate conspiracist, who then peddled it to reporters for media attention, CNN reported.The tweet read: “Don’t care re Polanski, but I hope if my daughter is ever raped it is by an older truly talented man w/a great sense of mise en scene.”Seder, in response to criticism, explained he wrote the tweet to express dismay that anyone could find an excuse for rape, particularly of a child.“I wrote that tweet out of disgust with those who were excusing or were seeking to advocate forgiveness for Polanski’s actions which caused him to flee the US,” Seder told CNN. “I was appalled that anyone would diminish the seriousness of rape, particularly of a child by citing the perpetrator’s artistic contributions. Obviously, I would not wish any harm of my daughter or any other person.”David Duke, a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, was among those celebrating news of Seder’s removal on Twitter this week."
73,ARTS & CULTURE,Spike Lee's 'She's Gotta Have It' Show Is Black Art That's Free To Be Mediocre,Zeba Blay,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/spike-lee-shes-gotta-have-it_us_5a1c1d5fe4b0cee6c05102e1,It's OK not to love all black art.,2017-12-07,"Executive producer Tonya Lewis Lee and Spike Lee attend the premiere of ""She's Gotta Have It"" on Nov. 11. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a293b05140000fe79b6bed9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"“She’s Gotta Have It” made me angry ― a reaction I hadn’t expected, but was ultimately thrilled with. In 1986, when Spike Lee made his film debut with “She’s Gotta Have It,” the concept of a black woman dating three men at the same time was an edgy one. The novelty of the conceit, empowering though it may be, has worn off in the 2017 Netflix reboot of the film. There’s a tendency to praise black art for the sake of being black. Most black people can identify with Issa Rae famously declaring, “I’m rooting for everybody black.” Authentic representations of black people created by black people have had to be exceptional to receive even the slightest praise in the film and television industries. Sometimes, any form of representation feels like a win, and criticism of that representation feels like a betrayal. But maybe now’s a good time to sit with, consider and process how we praise and how we criticize black art.Because for all its glorious blackness, and for all its good intentions, “She’s Gotta Have It” is not necessarily a good show. And that’s OK. In this update, set in the Fort Greene neighborhood of Brooklyn, Nola Darling is a black millennial with a capital B, and the series will remind you of that every chance it gets. “I’m a sex-positive, polyamorous pansexual,” Nola tells us from her iconic Loving Bed, the only place she has sex with her rotation of partners. “I consider myself abnormal. But who wants to be like anybody else?”This is a show about black female sexuality, but only nominally. It actually has little to say about black female sexuality, and hardly anything to say about queerness. Nola is not so much a sex-positive, polyamorous, pansexual, black feminist 20-something artist living in Brooklyn as she is the idea of one. In this sense, “She’s Gotta Have It” is an intense exercise in suspension of disbelief. We need to believe, for instance, that Nola Darling would actually enjoy the company of any of the wack dudes she’s dating (with the exception, perhaps, of Mars Blackmon).And we need to believe that Nola’s art, while perfectly fine, is as incendiary and groundbreaking as it’s presented in the world of the show. (The best of her work comes in the form of a #MyNameIsnt street campaign based on Tatyana Fazlalizadeh’s 2012 “Stop Telling Women To Smile.”) Nola ― and, indeed, everyone around her ― talks in hashtags, dresses like an Afropunk attendee, and makes constant pop culture and film references that are supposed to seem worldly and cultured but just read as random and superfluous. (At two different points in the show, she chastises her lovers for having never heard of the hardly obscure movies “Terms of Endearment” and “Dirty Pretty Things.”)But Nola, played by the effervescent and stunning DeWanda Wise, has a lot of heart and a lot of genuine goodness, which makes up for her characterization in a show that sometimes feels as though it’s coming from a world and a time that young, independent black women aren’t actually living in. Nola declares herself to be proudly sex-positive, polyamorous and queer, and yet the lack of transparency between herself and her lovers throughout the series suggests that not only Nola, but the show’s creators, aren’t quite sure what to make of these concepts.Each episode is, for better or worse, dominated by Lee’s very distinctly old-school point of view. (He wrote several episodes and directed the entire series.) Perhaps that’s why the show feels out of step. Or perhaps it’s the fact that many of the writers on the series, including Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Lynn Nottage, are older, with backgrounds steeped more heavily in theater than in television. Whatever the reason, the result is a show that wants so badly to be au courant and relatable but that, with its monologues and problem-of-the-week episode structure, feels anything but. In episode two, ”#Bootyful,” Nola’s friend Shemekka grapples with the decision to get butt injections. Despite the show’s pretense of being all about empowering black women, the narrative ultimately humiliates and shames Shemekka ― who decides to go through with the procedure and turns out an amazing performance at the burlesque club where she works, only to end up in the hospital when her ass shots grotesquely pop open. She’s bedridden for most of the rest of the series. This is the type of ankh-and-ashy moralism that taints the otherwise great parts of the show. Nola is an archetype, a beautiful enigma, rather than a person. The problem here is that the entire series is about Nola pushing back against labels, against other people’s definitions of who she is, against ownership and expectations. In the show’s finale, a Thanksgiving episode, Nola invites her three lovers to dinner and has a breakthrough: She is actually the man of her dreams. But Nola is too flat a character for the epiphany to feel at all earned. It’s just the show assigning her another arbitrary label. “She’s Gotta Have It” has moments of genuine brilliance: Anthony Ramos’ weird, hilarious performance as one of Nola’s lovers; the excellent soundtrack of entirely of black music; the commentary on gentrification in Fort Greene, police brutality and Donald Trump; DeWanda Wise’s everything. But the show’s flaws are numerous, and it has rightly been called out for them ― for its limited representation of queer black female sexuality, for its unconscious misogyny, for its shallow radicalism. These critiques are the most valuable thing about “She’s Gotta Have It.” The imperfect show, at times infuriating in its tone and point of view, marks an important point in the conversation about diversity and representation: It is a lackluster work of black art that is free to be lackluster, that doesn’t have to bear the full weight of the culture from which it has emerged. It need not represent anything but its own ambitions. There is room for mediocre black art. There is room for black art that not all black people have to love. There is room for black art that falls short of its potential. Nola is a prime example of this: Her beautiful, realistic portraits of black woman are just OK until she pushes herself to move past archetypal representations and toward something more personal and difficult. Some black art will poignantly capture us in a way that truly resonates; some black art may totally miss the mark; some works, like “She’s Gotta Have It,” will be a frustrating mixture of the two. This is an important thing to acknowledge, especially in the case of a creator and a cultural leader like Lee, who for years has enjoyed a kind of critical immunity among black audiences. There’s no denying the importance of Lee’s past works, from “Do the Right Thing” to “School Daze” to “Malcolm X.” He made films for the culture and about the culture that entered the zeitgeist without ever pandering to white audiences. Lee has also made less-than-stellar movies. But his presence and prominence in the mainstream was such a hard-won victory, both for himself and for black folks, and his worst critics so often confirmed the urgency and necessity of his work, that he seemed to get a pass from the people best equipped to engage with his movies. As his filmography grew, his weaknesses as a storyteller became more pronounced — the outdated racial and gender politics of “Chi-Raq,” the erratic overstylization of “Red Hook Summer” — and his work seemed to lose touch with what had made him vital in the first place.“She’s Gotta Have It,” after all, is as much a piece of deep nostalgia for a time when Lee’s voice was fresh and singular as it is an exploration of black female sexuality and autonomy. Season 1 of the show ends with Nola finally establishing control of her relationships with her lovers and sending them on their way, thankfully avoiding the original film’s jarring rape. It shows growth, but so much of this show otherwise feels awkwardly tethered to the past. What has changed since the original “She’s Gotta Have It” is that Lee is now one of a number of great black filmmakers. He is not the great black filmmaker, and neither his work nor his stature is too fragile to withstand critique and debate. This is how art, how representation, how conversations about the ways we reflect back to ourselves get stronger, better, more authentic. No, “She’s Gotta Have It” isn’t great. But it’s great that it exists. "

She would not, for instance, say whether Moore, an Alabama Republican, still believed that homosexuality should be illegal or that Muslims should not be able to serve in Congress. Instead, Janet Porter, who is from Ohio, repeatedly insisted during the interview, which turned into a verbal sparring match, that Alabama was “ground zero for freedom” and a brewing “culture war,” and that Moore “stands for religious liberty” and “the Constitution.” On several occasions, Porter referred to Moore’s Democratic opponent, Doug Jones, as “Abortion Jones.” Early in the 15-minute interview, Porter was grilled by Cooper on the sexual misconduct allegations against Moore. Porter insisted the accusations were false — planted by “the lynch mob media” and promoted by a host of conspirators, including the “Democrat establishment,” people from the “abortion lobby” and billionaire George Soros.“Your campaign has blamed an awful lot of people for the accusations being made by women against Roy Moore,” Cooper said, rattling off several examples including Jones, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, “mainstream Republicans … homosexuals, transgender people and criminals.”“Can you just explain to me how all these people got together and came up with this plot against Roy Moore? I don’t know if there’s a conference call that Mitch McConnell and, like, radical homosexuals are on, but it’d be fascinating to hear that,” Cooper quipped.Porter argued that “the establishment” is wont to push false allegations against candidates it doesn’t like. And when “false allegations are generated,” she said, “there tends to be a pile-on. That’s how a lynch mob works.”Cooper later pushed Porter to answer several questions about controversial public statements that Moore had made. Porter, however, was either unable to answer the questions or attempted to evade them entirely.“Does Judge Moore still believe that homosexual conduct should be illegal and homosexuality is still the same thing at bestiality?” Cooper asked, quoting an interview Moore gave in 2015.“I can’t answer that question,” Porter replied.“Can you get back to me on whether or not he believes homosexuality should be illegal?” Cooper pressed, after Porter said that Moore “believes the Bible and what the Bible has to say.”“If you don’t want to answer, that’s fine. But can you get back to us?” Cooper cut in, prompting Porter to finally agree that she would. Cooper then quizzed Porter on whether Moore still believes the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorism attacks happened because “we’ve distanced ourselves from God” or that Muslims should not be able to serve in Congress ― questions Porter did not have the answer to. “Does he still believe Barack Obama wasn’t born in the United States?” Cooper asked.“You know what,” Porter replied, waving the question away, “that issue has kind of come and gone.”“Does he still believe that the U.S. is ‘the focus of evil in the world’ because of same-sex marriage?” Cooper queried. “You can ridicule his biblical beliefs if you want,” Porter replied, not answering the question. “The Bible has very clear things to say about a lot of issues.”“You’re the spokesperson, and you seem unwilling,” Cooper later told Porter as the interview came to a close. “I know you’re not from Alabama, but you seem either not to know what his positions are or are unwilling to actually tell me what his positions are.”Watch the full interview in the videos below:"
