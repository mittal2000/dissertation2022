United Technologies faced no barriers this year when shipped manufacturing from Indiana to Mexico. It was the same for Rexnord, which closed its ball bearing plant in Indianapolis this year and sent it across the border to Mexico, no problem. As the United States’ trade deficit with both Canada and Mexico skyrocketed in the 20 years after NAFTA took effect in 1994, the United States lost 881,700 jobs. That figure is three years old, so it does not include United Technologies and Rexnord moving 1,600 Indiana jobs to Mexico. Since NAFTA, more than 60,000 factories closed in the United States. Clearly part of the lure is wages. While a manufacturer may pay $20 an hour in the United States, it’ll only pay $20 a day in Mexico, where the average manufacturing wage is $2.49 an hour. Labor organizations there are almost always completely controlled by corporate employers, rather than by the workers. So securing raises is nearly impossible. And while many formerly American manufacturers moved just across the border to special industrial areas, overall job growth in Mexico was not significant. That is because subsidized corn exported from the United States bankrupted huge numbers of small Mexican farmers and many corporations have moved their factories again, this time from Mexico to even lower-wage China and other south Asian countries. That’s just great for rich investors and fat cat CEOs. It’s been horrible for workers in Mexico, Canada and the United States. What has trickled down has been toxic – lost jobs, stagnant wages and worry. The difference in the way NAFTA treats corporations and workers is stark. Corporations get special perks in the main NAFTA document. The rights of workers are dealt with in an addendum. They’re an afterthought. NAFTA gives corporations an extraordinary privilege. They can sue governments for what they contend are “lost profits” if they don’t like regulations or legislation. They don’t have to present their cases to real judges in open court, either.

Corporations can force governments to pay if lawmakers protect citizens by, for example, banning a neurotoxin or limiting sale of dangerous products. There’s no counterpart for workers. NAFTA provides no way for the Carrier workers laid off in Indianapolis by United Technologies to sue.

2,POLITICS,Views Of The Confederate Flag Have Softened Since The 2015 Charleston Shooting,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/views-of-the-confederate-flag-have-softened-since-the-charleston-shooting_us_5994b06ee4b0acc593e4dd48,"Americans are now more likely to call it a symbol of ""Southern pride"" than racism.",2017-08-16,"A clash over the Confederate flag this past weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5994b0b62700003600d4f5f9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Americans are more likely to see the Confederate flag as a symbol of heritage than one of hatred, according to a new Economist/YouGov poll taken in the aftermath of the violence last weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia.By a 5-percentage-point margin ― 43 percent to 38 percent ― those polled say the flag mainly represents Southern pride rather than racism.And by 54 percent to 26 percent ― a 28-point margin ― the public sees statues of Confederate war leaders such as Gens. Robert E. Lee and Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson as representing Southern pride, rather than racism.Views are divided along racial lines. Black Americans are 32 percentage points likelier than white Americans to consider the Confederate flag a racist symbol, and 27 points likelier to say the same about Confederate statues, according to the poll. The racial divide is especially pronounced in the South, with black Southerners 40 points likelier than white Southerners to consider the Confederate flag racist.But there’s an even wider gap along political lines, with voters who supported Hillary Clinton in last year’s presidential election 65 percentage points likelier than those who supported President Donald Trump to consider the flag primarily a symbol of racismOpinions on the Confederate flag were less positive in June of 2015. Following the murders of nine black Americans by a white supremacist in a church in Charleston, South Carolina, 41 percent of Americans said the flag was largely a symbol of racism while 35 percent said it represented Southern pride. Just months earlier, 41 percent viewed the flag as emblematic of Southern pride, while 31 percent saw it as a racist symbol.One potential reason for the different responses after Charleston and Charlottesville: Two years ago, politicians in both parties were condemning not only the killings at the church, but Confederate symbols. Then-Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley and then-South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, both Republicans, had the Confederate flag removed from the grounds of their state capitols. And GOP presidential candidates including former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) spoke out against the flag. Trump, by contrast, waited two days after the violence in Charlottesville to condemn hate groups by name ― and then soft-pedaled that denunciation the next day, saying “both sides” shared blame.But even after the Charleston murders, the public ― including Democrats and black Americans ― leaned against changing the names of streets, school buildings and public facilities memorializing Confederate figures.Today, pulling down statues commemorating the Confederacy remains a difficult sell. In another survey released Wednesday, conducted by Marist College for NPR and PBS Newshour, just 27 percent of Americans said that statues honoring leaders of the Confederacy should “be removed because they are offensive to some people,” while 62 percent said they should “remain as a historical symbol.”“African Americans are divided on the question — but a plurality agree they should stay, 44 percent to 40 percent. Two-thirds of whites and Latinos believe the statues should remain as well,” NPR’s Domenico Montanaro said. “The only groups in which a plurality said the statues should be removed are Democrats, especially those identifying as ‘strong Democrats,’ those identifying as ‘very liberal,’ and those who disapprove of the president.”The NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll surveyed 1,1125 Americans on Aug. 14-15, using live interviewers to reach both landlines and cell phones. The Economist/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Aug. 13-15 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population."

4,QUEER VOICES,Anti-Trans 'Bathroom Bill' Dies In Texas,"By Jon Herskovitz, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/texas-bathroom-bill-dies_us_5993cfd9e4b0e789a947df6d,"Business leaders and civil rights groups had battled to defeat the bills, saying they advanced bigotry, would tarnish the state’s image and damage its economy.",2017-08-16,"Transgender activist and San Antonio architect Ashley Smith was among many who protested against the so-called ""bathroom bill"" in Texas.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5993d03c22000009371a62d5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Texas measures criticized as being discriminatory for limiting transgender people’s access to bathrooms in schools and public buildings died on Tuesday, as the House adjourned and ended its special legislative session.Business leaders and civil rights groups had battled to defeat the bills, saying they advanced bigotry, would tarnish the state’s image and damage its economy. The measures were blocked by moderate House Republicans.Adoption by Texas, the most populous Republican-dominated state, could have fed momentum in other socially conservative states on the issue, a flashpoint in the U.S. culture wars.“Finally, Texans can breathe a temporary sigh of relief,” said JoDee Winterhof, an official of the Human Rights Campaign that lobbied against the bills.“Texans don’t want harmful, anti-transgender legislation,” Winterhof, the campaign’s senior vice president for policy and political affairs, said in a statement.Momentum for so-called bathroom bills stalled this year when North Carolina partially repealed a similar law in March. The original law prompted boycotts by athletic bodies and businesses that are estimated to have cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars.Texas could have lost about $5.6 billion through 2026 if it had enacted such a measure, said the Texas Association of Business, the state’s leading employer grouping.The House wound up its duties without taking action on any of the bills and adjourned “sine die,” a day ahead of the official end of the 30-day special session.House Speaker Joe Straus, a pro-business Republican who controls the agenda in the chamber, said the issue was not a priority.Straus’ position was reinforced by a well-financed campaign by major corporations, including Texas-based energy companies Halliburton and ExxonMobil Global Services, which have said the bills would make it hard for them to recruit top talent.The measure that advanced the farthest was Senate Bill 3, which passed easily on a party-line vote in the Republican-controlled Senate and then died in the House.It would have required people to use restrooms, showers and locker rooms in public schools and other state and local government facilities that match the sex on their birth certificate, as opposed to their gender identity.Supporters, including Republican Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, a staunch social conservative, say the proposed curbs promote public safety and protect vulnerable women and children."
5,POLITICS,UVA Employee Suffers Stroke After Protesting White Supremacist Rally,Matt Ferner,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tyler-magill-stroke-charlottesville_us_5994b2e2e4b0d0d2cc83ff58,Friends and colleagues say Tyler Magill's stroke is the result of being struck with a Tiki torch.,2017-08-16,"People rally against white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Aug. 12, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5994c5f51400001f002c3283.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Tyler Magill, a University of Virginia employee who protested a rally of Tiki torch-carrying white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, is recovering from a stroke after being injured in the weekend’s violence, the Chronicle of Higher Education reported on Wednesday. After Magill was admitted to the university’s medical center on Tuesday, doctors discovered that his carotid artery was partially dissected, causing a clot that resulted in a stroke, according to The Chronicle. Doctors suspect Magill sustained “blunt force trauma” to his neck, the paper reported, citing a family friend of Magill’s. Lisa Moore, a friend of Magill’s who set up a GoFundMe page to help with the costs of his recovery, told HuffPost that Magill originally went to the ER on Tuesday because he was losing his vision. While he was there, Moore said, his carotid artery tore and two blood clots were released to his brain, causing a stroke. “Tyler reported that he was hit by one of the Tiki torches Friday night on UVA grounds,” Moore said. “That was his only reported injury from the weekend, though he was very active in the counter-protest. I was with him for much of Saturday because I was there as a nurse and medic and I was on the scene of the car crash, treating victims.” Moore said Magill’s friends and loved ones don’t have “definitive proof” that the torch caused the injury, but she said “it is certainly the most likely scenario.” She added that there is an ongoing search for video of the alleged assault.She also said that Magill’s health is improving: “He is able to speak and recognize friends and is regaining function on his right side. He will need a lot PT and likely other therapies.”While Magill’s friends and supporters say a white supremacist caused his injury, Magill’s brother-in-law Loren Mendosa said that’s “conjecture” in an interview with BuzzFeed. Mendosa told BuzzFeed that Magill’s memory is a bit foggy because of his stroke.The university’s medical center did not immediately respond to a request for comment.UVA Library posted a link to the GoFundMe page to help Magill, who worked at Alderman Library, as he recovers. White supremacists descended on Charlottesville over the weekend for a “Unite the Right” rally that exploded into deadly violence on Saturday, when a driver plowed into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer and injuring at least 19 others.James Alex Fields Jr., 20, has been charged with second-degree murder in the incident.In a video posted to Twitter on Sunday, Magill can be seen walking behind Jason Kessler, an organizer of the rally, and blaming him for Heyer’s death. Kessler eventually fled his own press conference as counter-protesters shouted him down.“Her name was Heather, Jason, her blood is on your hands,” Magill says in the footage. “Her blood is on your hood.” Magill’s GoFundMe page features a photo of him with his arms raised above his head as he walks behind Kessler.“The community is trying to deal with and recover from fascist invasion and terrorist incidents on the streets of our downtown,” Moore said in an interview with The Washington Post. “Tyler was everywhere that mattered last weekend and he was everywhere he needed to be. We just want to do all we can to aid his recovery.”"
6,THE WORLDPOST,Trump’s North Korea Bluster Has Shattered U.S. Standing As Global Leader,"Hugh White, ContributorProfessor of Strategic Studies, Australian National University",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-north-korea-china_us_59947900e4b0acc593e474d7,"The more stridently Trump says he is going to stop North Korea, the worse it looks when he fails, and the more Beijing stands to gain.",2017-08-16,"U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59949d8d14000020002c31f2.jpeg?cache=qqDVwKzWYj&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"CANBERRA, Australia — Rivalry between great powers is plainly escalating in many parts of the world. When that happens, specific local issues often take on a much broader significance. And so it is with the present tension over North Korea’s nuclear program.The issues are very serious in their own right, but they become even more important because they play into the wider contest between China and the United States over their future roles in Asia. Will the U.S. remain Asia’s leading power and the arbiter of regional order? Or will China take its place?Clearly, America’s standing as regional leader would be dramatically reaffirmed if U.S. President Donald Trump could convince or compel North Korea to abandon its nuclear program and stop threatening America and its allies. But just as clearly, U.S. standing would be weakened if Trump fails. In the zero-sum logic of major power rivalry, that would be a win for China. Moreover, the more stridently Trump says he is going to stop North Korea, the worse it looks when he fails, and the more Beijing stands to gain.That is especially true when he threatens to use armed force. Although wars between great powers have been mercifully rare in recent decades, their perceived ability and willingness to use force remains central to their power and influence.Such is the strange and seemingly immutable pattern of power politics. It explains why great powers, including America, spend so much money on armed forces even when they face few, if any, direct threats to their own security. It explains why a country’s broader standing is so seriously undermined when it threatens to use force and then backs down.And it explains why Trump’s recent wild talk about war has been so damaging to America’s international leadership. His threats to use force to stop North Korea’s intercontinental ballistic missile program will prove empty because his only military options could escalate into the biggest conflict since 1945.So America will not just end up living with an ICBM-armed North Korea. It will find its leadership in Asia sharply diminished in the eyes of both its allies and its rivals. Look at the allies first. Countries like Japan and South Korea depend on America for their security because they are confident that America will fulfill its promises to go to war to protect them if necessary. In return, their support is essential to America’s international leadership. But their support falters when their confidence is undermined by America failing to use force when it says it will.This is a particular problem for America’s Asian allies today because their confidence in U.S. resolve is already weakened. The closer North Korea gets to having the capacity to attack U.S. cities using nuclear weapons, the less confident those Asian allies can be that the U.S. will be willing to shield them from North Korean threats. And the richer and more powerful China becomes, the more it will cost America to stand up to China on its allies’ behalf and the less confident they can be that America will be willing to accept that cost.To some extent, such uncertainties are part of the normal stuff of alliance management, but they have become much more acute in recent years. Back in the Cold War, few doubted America’s resolve because the Soviets so obviously posed a true existential threat to U.S. security, and U.S. leaders were very careful to uphold the credibility of their undertakings.After the Cold War, the U.S. seemed to face no serious rivals, so the question did not arise. Only recently have serious doubts about U.S. resolve really appeared. Now, under Trump, they are growing fast.America’s rivals will also draw important conclusions from what Trump has said. They will be reassured that, whatever its leaders might say, America lacks the resolve to use armed force to protect its position as a global and regional leader. They will therefore be emboldened to challenge U.S. leadership more blatantly.In Asia, America will find it harder to deter China’s assertiveness in the South China Sea, which is deliberately intended to display China’s growing ability to defy U.S. power in the maritime domain, where it was once strongest. And it increases the risk that if, one day, Trump or his successor threatens to use force and really means it, Beijing will underestimate U.S. resolve and push ahead, sparking a war that both would rather avoid — 1914 redux. It is easy to see then why national leaders — especially leaders of great powers — have always been so exceptionally careful about threatening the use of force. Of course, everyone can make an occasional slip. Even former U.S. President Barack Obama, normally a model of caution, went too far in setting a red line around Syria’s use of chemical weapons; America’s credibility took a serious hit when that red line was crossed, and the U.S. did nothing.But Trump is different. Never before have we seen the leader of a great power speak so loosely about this most important subject. He seems quite unaware of the consequences for America’s credibility and international standing. Indeed, he hardly seems to understand that he speaks for America at all. With Trump, everything is personal.So where will this lead? Alas, the answers are all too clear. Most likely, prudent allies will rely less and less on the U.S. Ambitious rivals will push harder and harder to erode U.S. leadership and assert their own. America’s role as the upholder of order in key regions of the world will dwindle, and the world will become a more dangerous place.Alternatively, miscalculations on all sides may create a situation where Trump’s irresponsibility slides from talk to action, and America finds itself in a major war it need not fight and cannot win.

Lauren Ashcraft is the mother to a pair of 9-month-old twins named Liam and Lola. About two weeks ago, photographer Laura Stennett took some “smash” photos of Liam, but instead of smashing a cake (or donuts, as we’ve seen more recently), the baby posed with McDonald’s cheeseburgers. “Liam was such a chunky baby, I had always joked with Lauren about wanting to do a cheeseburger smash session with him once he could sit up,” Stennett told HuffPost. “It was just a silly idea because he’s so cute, and it was kind of a tongue-in-cheek play on the cake smash sessions that have become so popular.”The photographer said Liam loved doing the shoot. “At first, he was a little puzzled by what to do with all of the cheeseburgers,” she said. “Once he got the idea to put one in his mouth, he discovered he really liked the pickles! He gummed some of the patty and the buns and squished them in his fingers, but he was all about eating the pickles!”Stennett posted photos from the session on Facebook, where response was ... mixed. Although the first commenters said the photos were hilarious and cute, some negative reactions started to appear after a day or two. “They were shaming Lauren as a mother and vilifying me as a photographer for allowing ‘an innocent baby’ to be surrounded by McDonald’s cheeseburgers,” the photographer said. Both Stennett and Ashcraft realized that various special interest parenting group members were sending the photos around and then mobilizing to write negative comments all at once. Stennett said she’s still getting hate mail about the photos.“The irony of the whole thing is that I’m a vegetarian,” said the photographer. “I still thought the cheeseburger smash was funny. And no, we didn’t waste any food ― the leftover cheeseburgers were given to some wedding photographers and hungry kids!”She added that the reaction made her feeling terrible for putting Ashcraft and her son in a position where they could be hurt and offered to take the photos down. “Lauren is a good friend of mine, and an AMAZING mommy to her four kids,” she said. “It made me sick to my stomach to see the things people were saying about her ― especially since it was my silly idea to use the cheeseburgers.”Ashcraft said she anticipated this kind of reaction. “Even though we knew he hadn’t even eaten the burgers, some people like to blow things out of proportion,” said the mom. “Obviously nobody is going to feed an 8-month-old infant 20 cheeseburgers. Because, you know, common sense.”She thought the negative comments were absolutely ridiculous. “I had one lady go as far as to post his pictures publicly and tell me that thanks to me my son was going to die. Other attacks were ‘diabetes and heart disease by 2’ and ‘GREAT PARENTING,’” she continued. “At first I was defensive and tried to calmly explain what actually took place, but when I realized that was impossible, I just told myself these people need to lighten up,” Ashcraft added. “It was a silly photo shoot, and we used cheeseburgers as props kind of like a cake is a prop in a cake smash photo shoot.”For Stennett, the negativity was difficult for personal reasons. “What those commenters don’t know is that I have a medically fragile baby who is fed via G-tube,” she explained. “We blend organic fruits, vegetables and meats to feed her through her tube because we believe that food is medicine and giving her the highest quality nutrients will give her the best shot at health.”The photographer said she has also completely overhauled her diet to breastfeed her baby because her food allergies are so severe she can’t tolerate formula. “Even the most hypoallergenic formula on the market causes her to vomit and lose weight.”In response to the “onslaught of sanctimommies,” Stennett and Ashcraft decided to stage another food-themed photo shoot with Liam’s twin sister, Lola. This time, the baby posed with organic fruits, vegetables and health foods.“We thought it would be funny to post the link to Lola’s pictures on all of the hate-filled comments and see if they could then realize how lighthearted we were being about things,” Ashcraft said. “It was all done in jest!”Said the photographer, “It seemed better than letting them win by taking the photos down, or make us feel badly about a silly photo shoot.”Stennett added that Lola really enjoyed taking photos with the fruits and veggies. “She just chomped right on those organic strawberries, rainbow chard and beets! It was adorably hilarious.”Ultimately, the photographer hopes the story behind these photos can offer an important lesson. “Honestly, I really just hope people lighten up on judging others’ parenting choices,” said Stennett. “This was clearly a joke, but some people have felt the need to continuously harass and insult both Lauren and I for using McDonald’s cheeseburgers as props.”Although she works tirelessly to nourish her vulnerable baby and feeds her three older children healthy food, she noted that no parent is perfect in that department. “Our older kids have McDonald’s from time to time. There’s only so much we can do as parents,” she said. “But gosh, people just love to sit up on their high horses and judge others on the internet.” While Stennett noted that she’d love to tell off the people who criticize people for sport, she said engaging with them tends to make things worse. “That’s why we did the veggie smash with Lola ― it was much funnier and more effective.”Ashcraft said she hopes the photos make people smile. “Life is so full of negativity and unsolicited judgement and parenting advice! Lighten up and look at my cute babies, it’s that simple! And if you don’t have anything nice to say, shut your mouth. Didn’t your mom ever teach you that?”Despite the backlash, the mom said she’s glad they did the cheeseburger shoot and posted the photos because they are memories her family will always cherish. “Plus,” she added, “the twins definitely have a conversation starter for later in life.”Keep scrolling for more photos from the cheeseburger and produce photo shoots.

10,POLITICS,Charlottesville And American Authoritarianism,Zach Carter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/charlottesville-racism-authoritarianism_us_599304dce4b09096429a09a5,Fascism is always waiting for its moment.,2017-08-16,"White supremacists march with Tiki torches through the University of Virginia campus in Charlottesville, Virginia.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59930885140000cc36ed0c02.jpeg?cache=wnk6ZyJb3R&ops=crop_22_109_3923_1847%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"I spent election night 2008 in Charlottesville, Virginia, where I’d lived for the past six years. There was a lot to love about the town ― the music scene was loud, the swimming holes were clear and cold, the rent was $250 a month.Politics, however, were a problem. My friends were embarrassed by Charlottesville’s role in national affairs. Less than two years earlier, our congressman, Virgil Goode, had shocked much of the country by publicly denouncing the election of Minnesota Democrat Keith Ellison to Congress, on the grounds that Ellison was a practicing Muslim. “I fear that in the next century we will have many more Muslims in the United States if we do not adopt the strict immigration policies that I believe are necessary to preserve the values and beliefs traditional to the United States of America,” Goode wrote in a letter to hundreds of Virginia voters.In the months that followed, Goode’s office on the downtown mall was intermittently deluged by various protesters ― people angry about his letter and about the Iraq War he supported. He quickly transformed into a minor national figure. The anti-war group Code Pink showed up. People in town were excited by the the rush of attention, but most tried not to get their hopes up. Every two years, the city of Charlottesville voted against Goode by at least a 2-to-1 margin, but he’d been heading back to Washington for more than a decade anyway.The lines of Charlottesville’s congressional district were drawn to neutralize the city’s predictably liberal voting habits. The district runs north in a narrow strip almost to Maryland and stretches south to the North Carolina border, where it fans out across Danville, Martinsville and well into the Blue Ridge Mountains. On a map, the district’s outline looks a little bit like the Loch Ness monster emerging from the water. The last time a Republican presidential candidate failed to carry the district had been in 1968, when it went to the segregationist George Wallace, running on the American Independent ticket. Not that the problem was partisan: Goode himself had served two terms in Congress as a Democrat before switching parties.So the night of Nov. 4, 2008, was special. The town broke almost 80-20 for Barack Obama, and the only person (very slightly) more popular on the ballot than the first black president was a young man named Tom Perriello, who had decided to take on Goode in a long-shot bid for Congress. The 15,908 votes that Charlottesville delivered to Perriello were just enough to put him over the top, and the downtown mall that night was wild with celebration. Champagne corks flew as overjoyed young activists and graying hippies toasted each other until late. People danced, cheered, screamed and openly wept.I worked at a financial news and data company. One of my bosses ― not exactly a radical ― was irrepressibly exultant in the office the next day. “It’s like you can feel the darkness passing away,” he told a few of us. And it was hard to disagree. The Bush years had been one long, fumbling nightmare from Iraq to Katrina to Lehman Brothers. All of that was over now, we thought. The country had finally had enough. It had not. In the wake of the armed takeover of the town by Nazis and neo-Confederates this weekend, I like to think that in 2008 we were not so much naive as overly optimistic. You could not live in Charlottesville or attend the University of Virginia without confronting a host of demons that were much easier to ignore in the comfortable suburb where I grew up. The giant statue of Robert E. Lee glowering over Lee Park off the mall was not a secret. We were all appalled by Virgil Goode’s language, but like most of America, the town’s neighborhoods remained functionally segregated. Well-to-do white families kept their kids away from public schools. The downtown mall ― the place where we rummaged through used-book stores and rallied with Tom Perriello ― was built on the site of the historically black Vinegar Hill neighborhood, bulldozed decades earlier in the name of progress.My UVA bioethics professor liked to joke that libertarianism was the unofficial political philosophy of the student body. But most UVA kids tended to support laissez-faire only so long as it rested on a solid foundation of oppression. In 2003, when sophomore Daisy Lundy was poised to become the school’s first black student council president, she was attacked by a man who reportedly told her “nobody wants a n****r to be president.” Confederate flags were not an uncommon sight on the grounds, and Halloween blackface scandals at fraternities were a subject of debate, rather than official University penalties. UVA’s give-and-take between small-government conservatism and racial dominance politics reflects the peculiarities not of Virginia or the South, but of the nation itself. In his 2015 book Liberty and Coercion, Cambridge University historian Gary Gerstle argues that conservative enthusiasm for limited government has often relied upon, and obscured, a separate tradition of American authoritarianism. Paeans to Lockean liberalism are commonly deployed to keep federal officials from interfering with state-level repression, from the legal support for slavery to the public brutalities of Bull Connor. Early Supreme Court decisions did not even recognize the Bill of Rights as a check on state governments.Local communities have devised their own authoritarian solutions. In the 1920s, around when the Lee statue was dedicated in Charlottesville, the Ku Klux Klan saw a shocking resurgence not only in the American South, but across Ohio and Indiana. In Oklahoma, the Klan’s dominant influence in the state legislature led to the impeachment of a governor. In town after town, the Klan established control over daily life, policing interracial marriage, driving immigrants out of town and violently regulating crop shipments in an effort to boost prices for local farmers. For many communities, the group was not a terrorist organization, but simply the government itself ― a frightening precedent for Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s acknowledgement that state police were outgunned by the white supremacists who descended on Charlottesville Saturday.This authoritarian impulse has never been fully vanquished. But it is not the only American political tradition. As Ganesh Sitaraman details wonderfully in The Crisis of the Middle-Class Constitution, since the country’s founding, other patriots have battled to expand the bonds of citizenship and shared prosperity to an ever-broader political community. This was hard work, and the gains have been fragile, halting and incomplete. But they have been real. And they have, at times, forced authoritarianism to the fringes of political legitimacy.In 1992 and 1996, Pat Buchanan ran presidential campaigns that trafficked in the same ugliness of Donald Trump’s 2016 run ― but he failed to emerge as a serious national contender. The difference between the two men is not simply one of personality or celebrity. Something in America broke during the intervening years, and allowed the darker forces of our history to overwhelm our better political movements.It will be difficult to repair. But there is reason for hope, even among so much political wreckage. Charlottesville is a symbol of our difficult, ongoing national project, and despite the current authoritarian momentum, the city is continuing to try to come to terms with its history. A democratically elected city council voted to remove the Lee statue, with prompting from a black city council member. Friday night, as local police allowed torchbearers free rein over UVA, a few dozen students gathered around a statue of Thomas Jefferson, symbolically protecting what is good in the legacy of that profoundly flawed American icon. Unfurling a banner that read “VA Students Act Against White Supremacy,” they were literally surrounded by an angry mob brandishing fire and chanting a Third Reich slogan. That bravery can’t be erased. And it demonstrated to the world at least one American tradition worth defending. Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

11,HEALTHY LIVING,How To Combat Back-To-School Anxiety,"Kristi Hugstad, Contributor Author, speaker, certified Grief Recovery Specialist, and hos...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/school-bell-hell-how-to-combat-back-to-school-anxiety_us_59947d79e4b00dd984e37b97,"With the days get shorter and schedules getting fuller, August isn’t just about mourning the end of another summer; it’s",2017-08-16,"<p>When you suffer from anxiety or depression, a new school year can seem insurmountable. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59947dac2700001500d4f543.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale," With the days get shorter and schedules getting fuller, August isn’t just about mourning the end of another summer; it’s also the time to prep for a new school year. For some teens, another year of homeroom and homework can feel intimidating. Add in academic stress, athletic competition, social pressures and teenage insecurity and it can be completely overwhelming. For teens who suffer from anxiety, depression or other mental disorders, the “back-to-school” period can be especially troubling. For many, the fear of the unknown – like a new teacher, new school or new schedule – can cause or exacerbate feelings of anxiety, while those who suffer from depression might feel hopeless about succeeding academically or socially throughout another school year. Plus, teens today have much more to deal with than many parents (and even teachers and counselors) appreciate. From social bullying to gender confusion to drug and alcohol abuse, there’s often more to the upcoming school year than meets the eye. If you’re a teen – or someone who loves a teen – it’s important to know that you have the power to combat these feelings of anxiety and depression. These simple tactics can help you or someone you love tackle the year ahead.Get prepared Like any new activity, a new school year is always easier when you’re prepared for it. Get your class schedule in advance so you know exactly what to expect that first day. Make sure you’re prepped with all the supplies you’ll need. If you’ll be attending a new school, sign up for orientation or take a tour of the facilities in advance of the first week, getting acquainted with where your classrooms, restrooms and locker are located. Stick to a scheduleFor many with depression – teens and adults alike – mornings can be tough. And the idea of getting up early and tackling a new day at school can feel overwhelming. I recently read an Everyday Health article that spoke to the power of a morning routine in combatting depression. Setting a morning schedule that includes basic self-care like exercise or stretching, meditation or reflection, a healthy breakfast and social interaction with family and loved ones, can make a new day (or new school year) seem a bit less intimidating. Of course, the same idea goes for after-school routines, homework regimes and extracurricular schedules. Planning ahead can make each day feel a bit easier to handle. Talk about itChange is never easy, and can often be scary. If you have feelings of fear or anxiety about the upcoming school year, it’s important to express them. Speaking with a parent, friend or counselor can be the perfect way to start finding solution or healthy coping mechanisms together. If you’re unsure who to talk to, there are many free resources available for you – many of which I’ve listed at the end of this article.Do what you loveWhen you’re a teen, fitting in is important. Whether you’re a bookworm, jock or social butterfly, it’s easy to feel depressed or anxious when you’re trying to be something you’re not. Find activities, clubs or organizations that truly interest you. Chances are, when you do, you’ll find a sense of belonging and comradery that’s completely genuine. Get helpIt’s not abnormal for any teen to feel stressed about an upcoming school year. But if your feelings of anxiety or depression are interfering with your ability to eat, sleep or function on a daily basis, it’s time to seek professional help. A parent or counselor can help you find a professional to help you get through the upcoming year. If you need help immediately, you can always contact any of the resources below.

15,POLITICS,Pro-Trump Bloggers Are Trying To Disown The Alt-Right Brand After Charlottesville,Nick Wing,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alt-right-charlottesville_us_59932926e4b04b193360992e,"Meet the ""New Right."" Same as the alt-right?",2017-08-16,"White House strategist Steve Bannon, formerly the chairman of Breitbart Media, has helped bring the alt-right movement into mainstream.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5994688915000064908b6eb1.jpeg?ops=crop_0_638_3633_2200%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"The weekend violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, has left the alt-right with a serious branding problem, and not everyone aligned with the movement seems eager to take on the baggage of being associated with the frenzy of unabashed bigotry that took place at Saturday’s “Unite the Right” rally.Out of the fray came images of brawling neo-Nazis, marching Klansmen in full regalia and torch-bearing white men chanting anti-Semitic and fascist slogans, all capped by an alleged terrorist attack on counterprotesters that left one woman dead and at least 19 more injured. The event was the work of Richard Spencer, the self-proclaimed father of the alt-right, who is widely credited with coining the phrase. His version of the “alternative right” is based around white nationalism and white supremacy, and openly touts anti-Semitism, anti-feminism, homophobia and the belief that the U.S. should be established as a white ethno-state.Spencer summoned the various far-right factions to Charlottesville, calling for a show of strength and unity against the city’s slated removal of a Confederate General Robert E. Lee statue. While the groups may have differed somewhat in tone and style, they gathered around shared values openly grounded in white nationalism and white supremacy.On Tuesday, President Donald Trump defended the rally, saying that some of the attendees were “very fine people.” But as Trump continues to face backlash over his refusal to unequivocally denounce the ideology of hatred and supremacy that the alt-right organized around, some prominent figures associated with the movement have quickly scrambled to distance themselves from the label entirely.This week, prominent pro-Trump bloggers retweeted a Facebook post by Paul Joseph Watson, editor-at-large of the far-right conspiracy site Infowars, in an effort to draw a distinction between their views and the ones on display in Charlottesville.Jack Posobiec and Mike Cernovich are perhaps best known for pushing anti-Hillary Clinton conspiracy theories, including PizzaGate, among the alt-right.After Charlottesville, the two bloggers have been quick to distance themselves from the alt-right instead throwing their support behind Watson, who has regularly criticized Spencer as a firebrand who’s undeservingly been given a platform as a supposed leader of the far-right.In other tweets, Posobiec called the alt-right a “cancer” while referring to Spencer, the movement’s self-proclaimed leader, as “scum.” Posobiec identifies instead as “New Right,” he said. Which apparently means he likes to “wear MAGA hats, create memes & have fun.” On Tuesday, Watson said he, Posobiec and Cernovich, all of whom have also been referred to as members of the so-called “alt-lite,” no longer wanted to be lumped into the alt-right.Although Posobiec appears intent on dissociating himself from Spencer and the alt-right, he hasn’t always been such an outspoken critic. Spencer tweeted out an image of the two together in June.In a message to HuffPost, Posobiec maintained that he’d “never taken a photo” with Spencer, whom he called a “scumbag Nazi.” He said the image was “probably photoshop.” Asked if there was a place for white nationalism in the “New Right,” Watson said he had “zero interest in any movement based around identity politics or race.” Cernovich did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Charlottesville is the latest flashpoint in a larger war over the definition of the alt-right movement and its identity.During the 2016 campaign, the alt-right achieved more mainstream acceptance when Trump campaign manager Steve Bannon, formerly the chairman of Breitbart Media, proudly professed to Mother Jones that he viewed his former website as the homepage for the “alt-right.”At the time, the movement had already begun to take on a more nebulous identity, sweeping up a broad range of anti-establishment conservatives, tech-savvy libertarians, racial provocateurs, anti-politically correct internet trolls and pro-Trump meme-lords, slipping effortlessly between themes of racism, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, toxic masculinity and offensive hyperbole.As the movement grew, prominent bloggers like Cernovich and Posobiec emerged seemingly out of the internet ether, attracting hundreds of thousands of followers to promote a media narrative to counter the so-called “Clinton News Network” ― a name used to refer to CNN by its detractors. While they were happy to capitalize on the newfound attention given to a relatively unknown movement with ties to the Trump campaign, they’ve since slid in and out of the alt-right in an apparent effort to keep its darker, more overtly racist undertones at arm’s length.“I believe in strong borders, including keeping out Islamic terrorists. If people think that’s inherently racist, fine—but I’m an American nationalist, not a white nationalist,” Cernovich told The New Yorker last year.The rifts within the alt-right intensified after the election, with some members perhaps growing wary of their inability to have it both ways. Spencer and other white nationalists drew nationwide condemnation in November, when they were filmed “hailing” Trump’s victory with a Nazi salute.The tone against Spencer has grown harsher in recent months ― at least publicly.“[Spencer] fancies himself an outlaw intellectual when he’s a soft-faced fame whore who’d be performing in off-Broadway shows if he had the musical talent,” Cernovich told The New Yorker in July.While Spencer’s Nazi gesture may have been the beginning of the end for the alt-right as a viable political movement, some far-right bloggers now say that Charlottesville will make it impossible to identify as alt-right without being seen as an open racist.“As a ‘brand,’ the alt-right was irreparably damaged by HeilGate, but now it is dead and Spencer killed it, deliberately killed it, with malice of forethought,” wrote Katie McHugh, a blogger for the fringe conservative site GotNews who was fired from Breitbart earlier this year over a series of anti-Muslim tweets.The alt-right brand may now be dead in some people’s minds, but the views behind it clearly are not. Posobiec has tweeted about “white genocide,” a white nationalist conspiracy theory and recruitment tool that claims governments are trying to cull white people into extinction through policies of mass immigration, integration, racial diversity and abortion. Cernovich has also declared that “white genocide is real.”Posobiec, Cernovich and Watson regularly tweet about the Black Lives Matter movement, which they accuse of inciting hatred against whites and of not giving sufficient attention to black-on black-crime. And all three appear to share Trump’s belief that Middle Eastern refugees, and Muslims generally, are incompatible with Western culture and an existential threat to the U.S.Whether or not there’s a substantive difference between the “new” and “alt” right, the movement’s fracturing was somewhat foreseeable, said Brian Levin, director for the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. Loosely defined hate groups are not well-oiled machines, and high levels of disorganization often lead to fissures when they begin to garner national attention or support, he said.“It’s a lot easier to be a bigot in the abstract than to actually try to organize around hatred and anger, because not everyone wants to sign up to the same level or the same operation efforts,” Levin said. “The saying about herding cats also applies to white nationalists.”White nationalists, like other hate movements, also thrive on the image of being insurgents defending against a broken system. When they go on the offensive ― and especially when they succeed ― the foundation can begin to falter.“Part of the alt-right’s problem is they achieved their initial goals to promote white nationalism into the mainstream and dismantle the traditional barriers and structures that existed in the Republican Party, but now they’re ascendent,” said Levin. “It’s very difficult to organize a group that is anti-establishment once they become partially establishment.”Whichever version of the right these figures claim to identify with, it’s clear that they still have a friend in Trump.On Monday, still facing criticism for his soft, “many sides” response to the violence in Charlottesville, Trump retweeted a racially coded critique from Posobiec asking why the national media had dedicated so much coverage to the “Unite the Right” rally, but hadn’t expressed “outrage” over violence in Chicago.A day later, Trump held a contentious press conference, in which he parroted the far-right argument that anti-fascist and anti-racist protesters were equal aggressors in Charlottesville, and therefore equally as worthy of condemnation as their white supremacist counterparts.“What about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, ‘alt-right’? Do they have any semblance of guilt?” asked Trump. “I think they do.”Trump also defended Bannon amid rumors that his job is in peril, saying that he was “not racist” and “a good man.”White nationalists like Spencer and members of the so-called “New Right,” now supposedly in divergent camps, agreed that Trump had totally nailed it.

President Ernest Bai Koroma urged residents of the town of Regent and other flooded areas around Freetown to evacuate immediately so that military personnel and other rescue workers could continue to search for survivors who might be buried underneath debris.Dozens of houses were covered in mud when a mountainside collapsed in Regent on Monday morning, one of the deadliest natural disasters in Africa in recent years.“As the search continues, we have collected nearly 400 bodies - but we anticipate more than 500,” chief coroner Seneh Dumbuya told Reuters.Bodies continued to arrive at the city’s overwhelmed central morgue on Tuesday. Corpses were lying on the floor and on the ground outside for lack of room, a Reuters witness said.“Our problem here is space. We are trying to separate, quantify, and examine quickly and then we will issue death certificates before the burial,” said Owiz Koroma, head of the morgue, who also estimated the death toll to be in the hundreds.To relieve pressure on the morgue, authorities and aid agencies were preparing to bury the bodies in four different cemeteries across Freetown on Wednesday, said Idalia Amaya, an emergency response coordinator for Catholic Relief Services.Medecins Sans Frontieres is providing hundreds of body bags to authorities that the medical charity kept in Sierra Leone after the 2014-16 Ebola outbreak which killed 4,000 people in the former British colony.FEAR OF DISEASESierra Red Cross Society spokesman Abu Bakarr Tarawallie said by phone he estimated that at least 3,000 people were homeless and in need of shelter, medical assistance and food. The Red Cross said another 600 were missing.“We are also fearful of outbreaks of diseases such as cholera and typhoid,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation from Freetown. “We can only hope that this does not happen.”Contaminated water and water-logging often lead to potentially deadly diseases like cholera and diarrhea after floods and mudslides.Crowds of people gathered, waiting for news of missing family members.“I’ve been looking for my aunt and her two children, but so far no word about them,” said Mohamed Jalloh, crying. He said he feared the worst.President Koroma said in a television address on Monday evening that rescue centers had been set up around the capital to register and assist victims.Bulldozers dug through mud and rubble at the foot of Mount Sugar Loaf, where many residents had been asleep when part of the mountainside collapsed. The government said a number of illegal buildings had been erected in the area."

Headlines also focused on allegations involving the city’s tourism chief at the time, who has been charged in a separate union-related extortion case.Defense lawyers celebrated the verdict. They had argued the Teamsters Local 25 members were engaged in legitimate picketing as the union negotiated to secure real jobs, not to force the creation of nonexisting positions.“These gentlemen were executing their right to protest in favor of real jobs for union workers,” said Oscar Cruz, a lawyer for Redmond.Prosecutors claimed the Teamsters used homophobic and racial slurs and violent threats to try to secure pay for unnecessary services from a non-union production company filming “Top Chef” throughout the Boston area.Prosecutors said that on June 5, 2014, Redmond approached the show’s crew while it was filming at a hotel, demanded union members be hired as drivers and told a producer to call Mark Harrington, his union supervisor.They said after another hotel worried about picketing withdrew from participating in the show, production company Magical Elves switched to filming that June 10 at the Steel & Rye restaurant in the suburb of Milton.Prosecutors said Harrington, Redmond, Fidler, Cafarelli and Ross showed up at the restaurant and Teamsters chest-bumped and threatened crew members, slashed tires and blocked a food delivery.They said a van bringing Lakshmi to the set was also swarmed by Teamsters including Fidler, who told her, “I’ll smash your pretty little face.”Harrington was sentenced in December to six months in prison after pleading guilty.Before the Milton incident, prosecutors said Kenneth Brissette, who had been appointed the city’s tourism head by Mayor Martin Walsh, withheld permits to push the production to hire Teamsters.Brissette has pleaded not guilty to separate charges he tried to withhold city permits for a music festival using non-union workers. Walsh, a Democrat and ex-union leader, has said he expects his administration’s members to obey the law."
19,POLITICS,AFL-CIO Resigns From Trump's Manufacturing Council,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ceos-labor-union-trump-manufacturing-council_us_59935321e4b04b193360fe88,The departure comes after business leaders left the group amid controversy over the president's response to a white supremacist rally.,2017-08-15,"Several CEOs had resigned from President Donald Trump's manufacturing council, but AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka has so far indicated he plans to stay on board. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5993541215000064908b6ba4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"UPDATE: 6 p.m. ― The AFL-CIO resigned from President Donald Trump’s manufacturing council Tuesday evening. In a statement, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka pointed directly to remarks Trump had made that afternoon in which he defended people who attended a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. “We cannot sit on a council for a President who tolerates bigotry and domestic terrorism,” Trumka said. “President Trump’s remarks today repudiate his forced remarks yesterday about the KKK and neo-Nazis. We must resign on behalf of America’s working people, who reject all notions of legitimacy of these bigoted groups.”Previously:Four members of President Donald Trump’s manufacturing council have stepped down following his ambiguous initial response to a deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend. Yet one of Trump’s loudest critics from the 2016 campaign is staying put, at least for now.The AFL-CIO said Monday that it was “assessing its role” on the council, and a spokesman for Richard Trumka, head of the labor federation, said the following day that that position had not changed. The CEOs of Merck, Under Armour and Intel had left the council as of Tuesday afternoon, as had the head of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, a nonprofit with ties to the Steelworkers Union.The departures have put Trumka and the AFL-CIO in a tough spot. Leaving the council would no doubt invite the fury of Trump, and potentially damage the inroads the organization has made with the administration on manufacturing and infrastructure. But remaining on the council would lead many allies and union members to wonder why a handful of CEOs took a stronger stand against Trump than organized labor’s premiere federation did.The AFL-CIO is a coalition of 55 member unions across industries. HuffPost reached out to more than a dozen of them on Tuesday to see what they thought about the federation being a member of Trump’s manufacturing council. Most unions did not respond to the queries, and others signaled the delicate politics at work by saying they didn’t have a definitive position on the matter yet.The hospitality union Unite Here was one of the few to directly address the AFL-CIO’s membership on the council, but it stopped short of calling for an exit. “We don’t know what the outcome of the internal decision within the AFL-CIO will be, but regardless of that decision our union will continue fighting for social and economic justice for immigrant workers,” a spokeswoman said.Randi Weingarten, head of the American Federation of Teachers, couldn’t be reached on Tuesday, but a spokesman noted that she had already applauded those who had left the council: Member unions could put pressure on the AFL-CIO, but it is ultimately up to Trumka to decide whether to stay on the council. He noted Monday in his statement that the manufacturing council “has yet to hold any real meeting,” but that didn’t stop Twitter users from hammering him for not bailing on it.The internal politics at play are also tricky. Unions within the AFL-CIO don’t walk in lockstep, and Trump’s presidency has already exposed rifts within the federation. Some unions would have more to lose than others if the federation issued a public rebuke of the president. Public-sector unions, for example, are basically already at war with the administration and routinely criticize Trump in public. But the building trade unions are still trying to work with him on some kind of infrastructure package. Several of those unions are no doubt concerned about the damage that could result from the AFL-CIO protesting the president. Trump has already torn into the members who resigned from the manufacturing council, calling them “grandstanders” who are easily replaced. He singled out Merck CEO Ken Frazier, the first to leave, for a personal drubbing.Still, the pressure will only mount on Trumka if more executives leave the council and condemn the president in the process. And at a certain point, a resignation starts to look less like a principled stand and more like a capitulation to public pressure ― particularly for a guy who, not even a year ago, called Trump “an anti-American bigot.”Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

The events of that trip were highly scrutinized and alarmed some critics, but despite his reputation as a wild card and at times zig-zagging actions, thus far Trump’s handling of the situation in Qatar is an indicator that he may be more effective at foreign policy than he’s been given credit. If stability continues, it may also bode well for his stature among Middle Eastern nations.Qatar is a pivotal component of the U.S. fight against ISIS, housing Central Command’s regional headquarters. Last week two U.S. envoys have been dispatched to Qatar to deal with escalating tensions since the small-but-powerful nation declined to comply with 13 demands made by Arab neighbors, including closing a Turkish military base and shutting down Al Jazeera. The situation has been mired in tough talk, but relations have remained relatively neutral considering the seriousness of the threats involved. As the U.S. State Department navigates its strategy, things could still get ugly depending on what happens next. Even though Trump’s bait-and-switch strategy has worked so far, it would be wise to expect the unexpected. We’ve already seen a number of eyebrow-raising moments as the conflict surrounding Qatar developed. The U.S. envoys to Qatar come on the heels of an abrupt and short-lived break in diplomatic relations. On June 5, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt and several other Arab countries announced their grievances with the emirate accusing it of supporting terrorism and trying to destabilize the situation in the region. Qatar was subjected to a blockade, and former close allies announced the cessation of multi-directional relations. In addition, Saudi Arabia also excluded Qatar from the ruled Arab-led coalition in Riyadh.Tel Aviv supported the anti-Qatar campaign. Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said that “the diplomatic rift between Qatar and fellow Arab countries in the region opens up opportunities for cooperation in the fight against terrorism.” Trump created a stir when, despite the longstanding allied relationship between the two countries, he took credit for the organized sanctions, saying that Qatar “unfortunately has historically been a funder of terrorism at a very high level.”It is interesting that the largest Arab monarchies broke off diplomatic relations with Qatar shortly after Trump arrived in Saudi Arabia on his first foreign visit. In Riyadh, Trump spoke to the leaders of the 55 Muslim countries, giving a speech in which he harshly criticized terrorism and the states that support it. During the visit to Riyadh, Trump also closed a $110 billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia, the largest in history. The agreement provides for the modernization of the armed forces of Saudi Arabia, including the improvement of the air defense systems of the kingdom and the localization of the production of other types of weapons. In addition, the United States decided to supply Air Riyadh armament for $350 billion over the next 10 years.After Trump’s very successful visit to Saudi Arabia, unexpectedly on June 14, Qatar made a deal with the United States to secure F-15 fighters worth $12 billion. This news surprised many who expected Trump to remain in solidarity with Arab sanctions against Qatar.After this deal, the U.S. launched into the Gulf nations taking action against Qatar. Heather Nauert of the State Department said, “Now that it has been more than two weeks since the embargo started, we are mystified that the Gulf states have not released to the Qataris, nor to the public, the details about the claims they are making toward Qatar.” According to Nauert, “The more that time goes by, the more doubts are raised by the actions taken by Saudi Arabia and the UAE… At this point, we are left with one simple question: Were the actions really about their concerns regarding Qatar’s alleged support for terrorism? Or were they about the long-simmering grievances between and among the GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council] countries?”Secretary of State Rex Tillerson further complicated the mess a week later, stating that “Qatar has begun its careful review and consideration of a series of requests presented by Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and UAE. A productive next step would be for each of the countries to sit together and continue this conversation. We believe our allies and partners are stronger when they are working together towards one goal which we all agree is stopping terrorism and countering extremism. The United States will continue to stay in close contact with all parties and will continue to support the mediation efforts of the Emir of Kuwait.” This massive flip-flop was and continues to be a very significant moment in Trump’s Middle East policy. Was it intentional or a flub? Regardless, the deal demonstrates to the countries of the region, including Saudi Arabia, that the United States is seeking to regulate the conflict and continues to regard Qatar as its ally. Upon evaluation, we can say that Trump’s visit to the Persian Gulf and ongoing crisis management turned out to be successful for the United States. The Americans received big contracts worth billions, and Trump sent a message that he will continue mutually beneficial relationships in the region. Trump’s prestige increased as a result of positioning himself as a conflict mediator, and he projected control of the situation by reassuring major players like Saudi Arabia and Israel. He also put Qatar in check.Whether these victories come at a long-term cost remains to be seen. Although Trump acted as a “businessman” making profitable deals, he also revealed his loyalties when the ally-turned-foe allegedly supporting terrorism became a reliable partner again in just two weeks."

Yesterday, I just kept reading and I kept crying and,” he said before pausing to take a deep breath, “here we are today.”Tinsley attended the University of Virginia, where demonstrators carrying lit torches and Swastika flags were seen marching on Friday. He said he was preparing to fly home on Saturday when he witnessed the subsequent violence in Charlottesville on an airport TV.“All those places that you saw on TV ― Emancipation Park, that side street where that guy came down and plowed into all those people ― all those places, I’ve walked through part of my life,” Tinsley said. “And to see the ugliness that was brought to it, that hurt.”The musician took to Twitter to address the violence and deliver a “personal message” to those preaching hate: “You are not welcome in my city.”The Dave Matthews Band, which was formed in Charlottesville, released a similar message on Saturday that condemned “the acts of racist, hate-filled terrorism.”“Those people came from other places, like that kid who came and mowed down people in the street,” Tinsley said of James Alex Fields Jr., who came from Ohio to attend the rally in Virginia. Fields is accused of driving his car into a group of anti-racist protesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer and injuring more than a dozen others.Asked if he had ever witnessed a scene remotely similar in his city before, Tinsley replied, “Never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever.”That’s not to say that people with similar bigoted beliefs haven’t demonstrated in Charlottesville before. Rallies in recent months have been organized in response to the possible removal of a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee from Emancipation Park, formerly known as Lee Park.For example, in July, a few dozen Ku Klux Klan members gathered around Lee’s statue. In May, prominent white nationalist Richard Spencer led a similar demonstration in the city.Tinsley said he was out of town during the KKK’s gathering, but that his band Crystal Garden was there and performed in a counter rally “for unity and love” that was organized by Michael Signer, the Democratic mayor of Charlottesville.Jason Kessler, who organized this weekend’s “Unite the Right” rally and lives in Charlottesville, has accused the city’s residents of spewing “anti-white hatred” to CNN.“This entire community is a very far left community that has absorbed these cultural Marxist principles advocated in college towns across the country, about blaming white people for everything,” he said.Tinsley, in contrast, described Charlottesville residents as friendly, progressive and respectful of Americans’ right to free speech.“Your free speech in this town is a very important thing,” he pressed. “There’s even a board, a chalk board, down by the mall ... the free speech board and you can write anything you want.”That 54-by-7.5-foot board, called the Freedom of Speech Wall, allows the public to “express their views, in chalk, on any subject they choose,” according to the city’s tourism website.Perhaps demonstrators took advantage of that right over the weekend, but free speech doesn’t include the freedom to commit violent acts, Tinsley said.“The girl who died, she looks like and seems like all the other people I’ve known in Charlottesville since I was her age. She reminds me of friends of mine,” he explained. “Someone who’s willing to fight for something but also someone who’s very loving. She just embodied characteristics of someone from Charlottesville.”Asked if he believes President Donald Trump has done enough to condemn the recent outbreak of violence, bigotry and hate, Tinsley said he didn’t.“It’s been two days now and [Trump] finally comes out and says this almost reluctantly,” he said, referencing the president’s remarks on Monday denouncing hate groups, “and I just don’t understand why he has such a hard time condemning racism.”In terms of his own efforts, Tinsley said he hopes that another unifying concert will take place in the city.“There should be a concert for love, for peace, to try to wash away some of the negativity that people brought to our town,” he said.

Energy Secretary Rick Perry has cited the occasion as an opportunity to create a new continent-wide energy strategy. Given the administration’s focus on fossil fuels in its energy agenda, it would be unsurprising if its vision for such a strategy includes more oil and gas development, more cross-border pipelines, and more pollution threatening the North American people and environment.It is therefore up to U.S. cities, states, and businesses to work with Mexican and Canadian partners to create a North American energy strategy that protects the continent from the effects of climate change—and positions each country to benefit from the global shift to clean energy. This shift means big business for North America—a fact that seems to be lost on the current administration. Already, the solar industry alone accounts for 43 percent of employment in the U.S. electric power generation sector, providing more than 370,000 jobs in 2016 compared to approximately 86,000 through the coal industry.U.S. cities and states are up to the challenge. Although President Trump has stated his intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement, non-federal leaders across the country are stepping up in unprecedented numbers to lead the global climate effort. More than 200 cities and 9 states, for example, have joined the We Are Still In coalition, which has pledged to continue the fight against climate change and support the goals of the Paris Agreement.These U.S. cities and states—along with the cities, states, provinces, and national governments of Canada and Mexico—should collaborate to accelerate the cost reductions that clean energy has seen in recent years. Together, they should collectively commit to more ambitious clean energy deployment targets in order to demonstrate to the world that North America is still interested in bold climate leadership.At home, this would translate into jobs, less pollution, and safe and reliable power. It would also make progress toward the pledges that the United States, Mexico, and Canada made at the 2016 North American Leaders’ Summit, which include reaching 50 percent clean power generation across North America by 2025; advancing appliance efficiency standards, which reduce costs for businesses and families; and reducing methane and black carbon pollution, which endangers the health of our populations and our planet.A North American energy strategy should also promote a clean and equitable transportation system, given that this sector is second only to electricity generation in terms of carbon pollution. It’s a common sense move to significantly improve local air quality in metropolitan areas. By working together to expand vehicle electrification, states, cities, and provinces can fight climate change and improve the health and productivity of their citizens.Cooperation on carbon pricing to encourage clean energy deployment should be part of a North American energy strategy as well. The use of carbon pricing is growing across the region. Building on existing provincial success, Canada will implement its nationwide program by 2018. Eighty six percent of Canada’s population is already covered by a carbon price, and this number will rise to 100 percent under the national benchmark. Meanwhile, Mexico has a national carbon tax and intends to implement an emissions trading market by 2021.Absent federal leadership, U.S. states should consider coordinating and potentially linking with these nascent programs when feasible. The California-Quebec linked cap-and-trade system has already shown that integration is possible, promotes economic growth, and provides regulatory certainty for businesses and investors. By harmonizing carbon pricing systems—within borders, but also across them—jurisdictions can avoid a patchwork of policies and promote deeper and more cost-effective emissions reductions.As the rest of the world positions itself to lead and benefit from a clean energy future, a robust North American energy strategy is critical to the region’s long-term success—and in today’s world, an energy strategy must be a climate strategy. With a U.S. national plan focused on fossil fuel development, the most interesting opportunities for North American energy collaboration are among states, provinces, cities, and businesses. Together, they can chart the course for a clean growth agenda. And with the global clean energy market valued at more than a trillion dollars, it would do much more to capture the expanding economic opportunity than simply betting on the past.Sam Adams is the Director of the World Resources Institute, United States, and former mayor of Portland, Oregon.

An internal investigation by Warner Bros. found no wrongdoing after examining footage of the incident in question, and filming resumed later that month. The contestants involved, Corinne Olympios and DeMario Jackson, were invited back to continue filming, but both chose not to rejoin the cast. In promos for the season, ABC has dramatically referenced the scandal, which many believed at the time would mean the end of the road for the summer reality hit. It was revealed that the show would make use of footage from the first days of filming, prior to the shutdown, and would even show the relationship between Olympios and Jackson ― though not the moment that caused production to halt. Indeed, though Jackson told Entertainment Tonight last week, following an extended promo during the “Bachelorette” finale, “I’m glad footage of that day is being shown. ... This is a victory for all men who have been falsely accused,” none of the contentious footage of the couple was aired.For the most part, on its opening night “Bachelor in Paradise” avoided directly addressing the allegations or the investigation, though the show did take note of the temporary shutdown and its effect on the rest of the season. Instead, the show chose to highlight the lighter side of the show, even the playful flirtation between Jackson and Olympios on the first day of shooting.The premiere began with host Chris Harrison pacing the beach outside the empty Playa Escondida Resort in Sayulita, Mexico, where “Paradise” is filmed. His tone was somber as he spoke briefly about the effect of having the show on hold, not just on the viewers but on the cast and crew. He also focused on the good that could come out of the show, such as the love stories between past “Paradise” couples, including the recently wed Evan Bass and Carly Waddell ― and, as always, he promised “the most shocking, and yes, the most dramatic” season ever.The bulk of the episode was classic, upbeat “Paradise” fare. The original cast arrived and began to form first connections ― fan faves Dean Unglert and Kristina Schulman quickly sparked, to the joy of many viewers ― and cast members who had appeared on seasons of “The Bachelor” and “Bachelorette” together reunited joyfully at the bar.Olympios and Jackson garnered a good amount of screen time. Jackson admitted to the cameras that he hoped for a redemption arc after an embarrassing exit from the last season of “The Bachelorette.” Viewers also witnessed the two discovering a quick attraction and even hopping in the pool together ― fully clothed ― on the first afternoon of filming. They were also shown the following morning, eating breakfast side by side.The episode ended with producers pulling Olympios and Jackson away from the rest of the group in the midst of the first rose ceremony, at which the women were due to hand out roses to their chosen men. Instead of a rose ceremony, the night ended in confusion, with cameras lowered to the ground and cast members openly wondering what had happened. But that’s not quite all, folks: A teaser for the Tuesday night conclusion to the premiere revealed that the cast will return to “Paradise” and have a more frank conversation about what happened, leaving the situation unresolved for at least one more night.For more on “Bachelor In Paradise” check out HuffPost’s Here To Make Friends podcast below:Subscribe to Here To Make Friends: Apple Podcasts / Acast / RadioPublic / Google Play / Stitcher / RSSDo people love “The Bachelor,” “The Bachelorette” and “Bachelor in Paradise,” or do they love to hate these shows?

26,POLITICS,DACA Marks Fifth Anniversary Amid Looming Legal Threat,Roque Planas and Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/daca-marks-fifth-anniversary-amid-looming-legal-threat_us_59920a88e4b0909642993a00,A coalition of conservative states led by Texas hopes to kill Obama’s signature immigration achievement.,2017-08-15,Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton hopes to undo former President Barack Obama's signature immigration reform. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59920c5315000021008b688d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"AUSTIN, Texas ― Tuesday marks the fifth anniversary of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, former President Barack Obama’s farthest-reaching immigration reform. But instead of celebrating, many of the program’s beneficiaries will be out in the streets protesting a looming legal challenge to destroy it. Created in 2012, the DACA program allows so-called Dreamers ― undocumented immigrants who arrived in the country as children ― to work legally for a renewable two-year period, during which they are protected from deportation. Nearly 800,000 people have been approved for the program since then.But a coalition of states led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is threatening legal action to kill the policy, if the Trump administration doesn’t do it first. “It’s unfortunate that we have to be on the defensive, when support for DACA is very strong,” Karla Pérez, an organizer with United We Dream who is also enrolled in DACA. “DACA is that shining ray of light that we have right now. We have to take this opportunity to save it. It’s good for everyone.”United We Dream and other organizations have scheduled protests in several cities to mark the anniversary. Paxton and his allies hope to phase out the only major reform to immigration enforcement from the Obama era left standing. Since taking office, President Donald Trump moved quickly to gut the executive changes to deportation policy that Obama implemented after comprehensive immigration reform failed to pass Congress.The widespread use of prosecutorial discretion that staved off deportation for tens of thousands of people with inconsequential criminal records has been replaced with a policy of indiscriminately arresting virtually any undocumented immigrant that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents care to remove. Customs and Border Protection has barred asylum applicants from entering the country by land through the U.S.-Mexico border, in violation of U.S. and international law, according to a lawsuit filed against the Trump administration last month.Trump has also directed the Border Patrol and ICE to hire a combined 15,000 agents, though bureaucratic obstacles and a lack of funding from Congress will likely slow the process. And Attorney General Jeff Sessions has asked U.S. attorneys in all 94 federal districts to prosecute the crime of “illegal reentry” more aggressively. But Trump has left DACA alone, angering some conservatives who viewed the program as an unconstitutional way to skirt congressional authority. Paxton is responsible for torpedoing a more expansive version of deferred action that Obama tried to implement in 2014. The Deferred Action for Parents of Americans program, or DAPA, would have exempted as many as an estimated 3.7 million undocumented immigrants with U.S. citizen or legal resident children from deportation and allowed them to work legally. At the same time, Obama sought to expand DACA to a larger group of undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children.The lawsuit filed by a coalition of 26 states, led by Texas, was ultimately inconclusive. An initial ruling by U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen enjoined the program, while the lawsuit moved forward, and a split decision by the Supreme Court left DAPA and the expanded DACA at a standstill. Paxton hopes to tack on his DACA challenge to the same lawsuit that stymied DAPA. The case is still pending before Hanen, despite the fact that the Trump administration formally nixed DAPA in June. That strategy of amending the complaint in the DAPA case could favor Texas. The legal logic behind DACA ― that the executive branch can temporarily offer work authorization and deportation exemption for certain classes of people ― is the same one that guided DAPA. And Hanen has a reputation as a conservative judge. In a 2013 ruling, he accused the Obama administration of complicity in human trafficking for failing to punish Central American parents who send their unaccompanied children to the United States. And his ruling to keep DAPA from going into effect indicates sympathy for the criticisms brought by the state of Texas. It’s not yet clear whether Paxton will draw the judge he’s hoping for. The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF) filed a motion last month to dismiss the case, since the DAPA program no longer exists. If the case is dismissed, that raises the possibility that the legal challenge to DACA will fall before another, perhaps less conservative judge. A spokeswoman for the Texas Attorney General’s office declined to comment about where a lawsuit might be filed if the DAPA case is closed. Other factors may augur well for DACA supporters. For one, Texas won’t be able to ask the courts to stop DACA from going into effect, because it’s already been in place for five years. Texas may also face hurdles showing that the state has standing to sue, according to MALDEF’s Thomas Saenz. “The issue of standing is going to have to be resolved,” Saenz told HuffPost. “And I think that Texas is going to have a really hard time showing they have an injury, at least an injury that’s not completely overwhelmed by the benefits of DACA to the state…. And they’re going to be asked, ‘Well, why did you wait five years?’”Paxton also has less political support for his challenge to DACA than he did for fighting the more expansive DAPA program. Paxton’s coalition to challenge DAPA included 26 states, whereas the group that signed onto his threat of legal action over DACA includes just 10. While Obama’s use of executive authority to create the program was unpopular with Republicans lawmakers, many conservatives are wary of targeting young people who generally had no choice over how they immigrated to the country. And it was Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) who originally floated the idea of authorizing undocumented youths to live and work in the United States legally, while withholding the possibility of U.S. citizenship ― though he had imagined creating such a program through legislation.Supporters of the program also point to clear economic benefits. Some 95 percent of DACA recipients are either employed or enrolled in school, according to a study by the liberal-leaning Center of American Progress published last year. Work authorization helped raise the average hourly wage of DACA recipients by 40 percent to nearly $14, spurring a rise in major purchases like cars and homes. If DACA does face a legal challenge, the Trump administration could decline to defend it. Sessions has called the program unconstitutional for years, and the Department of Justice has not yet said whether it would defend the federal government’s own policy in court. Trump said in July that the decision is ultimately up to him but did not indicate which way he would decide. Congress could resolve the matter entirely if lawmakers passed legislation to give Dreamers some type of legal status, even through a temporary program like DACA. Last month, a bipartisan group of four senators reintroduced the Dream Act, a bill to give undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children a path to citizenship, but the White House immediately shot it down. There are also bipartisan bills in the House and Senate that would provide temporary protections, but it’s unclear whether those could pass or if they would be signed into law. The political stalemate leaves DACA recipients like Pérez unsure about the program’s future. Still, she remains hopeful that the same political movement led by undocumented youth that spurred the creation of the program five years ago can play a key role in keeping it alive. “I certainly feel worried and anxious,” Pérez told HuffPost. “At the same time, we have a sense of conviction that we have to do everything we can to insist that DACA remain in place… Families and immigrant youth won DACA by demanding it. Part of that victory means defending it.” "

Iowa-based hairstylists Kayley Olsson and Mariah Wenger witnessed this firsthand when a client came into their salon with matted hair and revealed she hadn’t taken care of it due to the mental health condition.The young woman, a 16-year-old high school student who wished to remain anonymous, told Olsson and Wenger that she came into the salon to cut off her damaged hair since she had to take school pictures. The two stylists refused to chop the teen’s locks and instead spent time untangling and styling her hair. In total, the pair worked on the student’s hair for 10 hours over the course of two days.Olsson, a 20-year-old styling student at Capri College, shared in a Facebook post how she and Wenger, 25, were touched by the young woman’s story.“She got to the point where she felt so down and so worthless she couldn’t even brush her hair, she told me she only got up to use the restroom,” Olsson wrote in the post.The stylists’ story has since been shared on the social platform more than 76,000 times. Olsson, who has also dealt with anxiety and depression herself, said that she wanted everyone who read it to take away one simple message: Mental health issues matter and should be treated with compassion.“I remember being her age and feeling that worthless, not good enough feeling,” Olsson told HuffPost. “Mental health is a huge thing and needs to be recognized more.”Depression, which affects an estimated 300 million people globally, is notorious for obliterating an individual’s energy and motivation. Couple that with difficult physical symptoms like back pain and headaches, it’s not hard to see why routine chores ― like hair care ― turn into major challenges.“I honestly feel [mental illness] is you at war with your own brain, when you want to do something but your body is telling you that you can’t,” Olsson said.Olsson and Wenger were able to help the teen preserve most of her hair and had her looking fabulous for her school portrait. But the end results of the process went beyond beautiful strands.“Her last words to me [were], ‘I will actually smile for my schools pictures today, you made me feel like me again,’” Olsson wrote in the viral Facebook post.Now that’s a good haircut.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story stated that an estimated 300 people globally have depression. In fact, it is 300 million people."

Breckinridge, a former U.S. vice president and Confederate war secretary, removed from outside the city's historic courthouse. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/599240ce15000021008b6926.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Mayor Jim Gray charted a deliberate course when deciding how to remove two Confederate monuments that stand in front of the historic downtown courthouse of Lexington, Kentucky.Now, two days after announcing that he would formally seek approval from the city council and a state body to relocate the statues honoring Confederate soldiers, Gray hopes that process will help prevent the sort of rallies and violence that engulfed Charlottesville, Virginia, this weekend, where three people died and more than 30 were injured amid clashes between white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups and counterprotesters.“We’ve been examining the question for almost two years,” Gray told HuffPost on Monday. “Some would say that’s way too long. I would say that change is better accepted when it’s understood. It’s not unexpected that you’d have pushback and challenge and different points of view on this. We’ve given it time for understanding, and th erefore, there’s a better chance for acceptance of the path forward.”Lexington, like Charlottesville, is a genteel southern university town with a progressive tilt that sets it apart from the more conservative areas around it.But so far, most responses to Gray’s announcement have been positive, he said, even if some local residents disagree with the plan.The Lexington Police Department, meanwhile, is not aware of any potential organized protests or actions from white supremacist or similar groups, said Brenna Angel, a spokeswoman for the department.Even if Gray’s plans were to evince a stronger reaction ― if white nationalists or neo-Nazis descend on the city as they did in Charlottesville, and have in multiple other cities ― those opposed to the monuments’ removal shouldn’t expect their resistance to work, said Steve Kay, Lexington’s vice mayor and a member of the city council. “The fact that there might be some kind of reaction is, in my mind, no reason not to go forward with something that is right for our community,” Kay said. “If people from the outside or locals feel they need to protest or counter-protest, we need to be ready to handle that. But the last thing in the world we want to do is to be intimidated. That’s exactly the wrong thing to do, is to back off from what’s right because some people threaten violence.”Gray and Lexington’s city council began exploring the removal of the two Confederate statues that sit outside the historic courthouse in 2015, when a grassroots group known as Take Back Cheapside began pushing the city to remove them from the courthouse location.The monuments honor two Lexington natives: John C. Breckinridge, the 14th vice president of the United States who later became the Confederate secretary of war; and John Hunt Morgan, a general who led Confederate troops in raids across Kentucky, Indiana and Ohio before a Union soldier killed him in battle in 1864.The statues’ location is a major reason why Gray and other city officials feel they need to be removed. The Cheapside area, where the old courthouse is located, was once the site of Lexington’s slave auctions, where thousands of slaves were bought and sold while others were held in prison pens nearby as they awaited sale to locations deeper in the South.“The Cheapside location, when you think about it clearly, there’s really no other choice,” Gray said. “We have two Confederate statues that are standing on really sacred ground. These men fought to preserve slavery and today they’re honored on the very ground where men and women and children were sold into slavery. That just isn’t right.”Councilwoman Angela Evans, one of three black members of Lexington’s city council, said that the statues’ presence in Cheapside has made the area “a sore spot and a place of pain for the African-American community.”“I’m certainly happy to see that it is now being recognized for what it is, and what it means to a large part of Lexington,” Evans said.Gray on Tuesday will formally submit a proposal to the city council to remove the Confederate monuments. The council must first vote to accept the proposal before it would hold a final vote later in the week on whether to approve it. Council approval would forward the proposal to the Kentucky Military Heritage Commission, which would also have to approve the measure in order for the city to relocate the statues from their current site.Take Back Cheapside, the group that has been pushing for the statues to be removed since 2015, is planning to rally outside Lexington’s city hall this week in an effort to convince council members to green light the removal process. “We’re just making sure we target any council member who may not vote for it to make sure they understand ... that it’s not a debatable issue,” said Russell Allen, one of Take Back Cheapside’s organizers.Even if the Heritage Commission approves the petition, the statues won’t disappear from the city: the current plan would move them to a park in Lexington’s suburbs, where there are other military monuments, and where they would be joined by two statues honoring Union soldiers. That plan, Gray said, is the result of the city’s lack of total control over the monuments and their location. The commission would not approve a move unless the city found a new location for them, he said.Allen, for now, says he is satisfied with the plan to move the statues to the park site. “The goal is to accurately depict the history,” he said. “We want to get those statues around greater men than those men ― great black leaders, great Union leaders. We want to tell the full story.”“Right now,” he added, “we want to make sure, first and foremost, that we get those Confederate generals and slave owners out of a former slave auction block.”Kay, Evans and Councilman Jake Gibbs, who represents the area where the statues are located, all support the plan to remove the monuments, and all three said that while they had not discussed Gray’s proposal with their fellow members, they expected it would win the eight votes needed to pass. (They were the only three members who responded to HuffPost’s general inquiry to the council.)“I’ve had interesting conversations with people who think we should respect the past and not tinker with it,” said Gibbs, who also teaches history at Bluegrass Community and Technical College in Lexington. “I respectfully disagree with them.”The statues, Gibbs noted, were put in place shortly after the Civil War, amid efforts to derail Reconstruction and prevent the full enfranchisement of newly-freed African-Americans.“Statues like these in Lexington and all over the South started popping up around this time,” Gibbs said. “They were statements that white supremacy was back.”Groups promoting white supremacy and similar ideas have been on the rise in recent years, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. Richard Spencer, the white supremacist leader who has organized rallies across the country, said Monday that his group and others will return to Charlottesville for more demonstrations, and said they could venture to other cities as well.No matter what opposition he may face, however, Gray said that the last few days have only bolstered his resolve.“What the events in Charlottesville did was confirm that this was the right thing to do,” he said.This article has been updated with comments from Russell Allen.Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

Shelters run on all cylinders to match pets with new forever families. Their efforts result in many pets finding new loving homes, but unfortunately some pets are left behind and live in shelters for months or even years until they are adopted. Inspired by a North Texas pet adoption effort led by our Dallas NBC and Telemundo stations, all of our NBC and Telemundo-owned stations decided to step up to the plate to help their local animal shelters and communities 'Clear the Shelters' every summer. Our Clear the Shelters pet adoption campaign has become a popular day of action for communities nationwide. Since Clear the Shelters was expanded nationally in 2015, the efforts of our stations and partners have resulted in the adoption of more than 70,000 homeless pets.I am excited that Clear the Shelters will return on Saturday, August 19 to local communities all across the country and include the participation of even more animal shelters and rescue organizations. I share my home and my life with a shelter dog. Jack, a two-year old Shih-Tzu and Jack Russell Terrier mix that my husband and I rescued through the Animal Lighthouse Rescue was a street dog in Puerto Rico. Jack is a great dog with a lot of love. We rescued Jack the day after we lost our 17 year-old dog, Zach. He helped heal us from that loss. He is funny, sweet and loves his new life. We couldn’t be happier with him. Thousands of animals have found their forever homes thanks to our Clear the Shelters event. From older dogs to kittens to rabbits to iguanas, Clear the Shelters has inspired local communities to take action and open their homes to pets in need. Last summer, “Rose"" a husky with a neurological syndrome who traveled from Turkey to a shelter in Briarcliff Manor, New York found a new home while “Tootsie,"" a senior Shih-Tzu with one eye was adopted by a family from Chicago, Illinois. If you are considering adopting a new pet, I invite you to visit a participating Clear the Shelters animal shelter on Saturday, August 19. You can find a list of participating shelters on ClearTheShelters.com.If you are not ready to adopt a pet, please join our social media effort to help us raise awareness about our third annual Clear the Shelters pet adoption campaign. You can upload an image of yourself with your pet or pets using the hashtags #ClearTheShelters and #LoveMyPet and list the reasons for loving your pet. You don’t need to have an adopted animal to participate. You can simply smile, snap a photo with your favorite furry or non-furry friend, share with the world why your pet makes you happy and upload your post and photo to your social media channels. Here is a photo of Jack!By participating in our social media effort, you will help us spread the word about Clear the Shelters and join a chorus of voices that are speaking up for the homeless animals that are currently waiting in a shelter near you to find their new forever home. Let’s work together this Saturday, August 19 to make Clear the Shelters another successful nationwide pet adoption campaign and make change happen. We’re excited about the opportunity to help more families find a pet and give homeless pets a new chance at life.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5993274322000009371a60b3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In the days since “alt-right” white supremacists descended on the town of Charlottesville, Virginia, for a white power rally, one Twitter user is leading the charge in exposing and publicly shaming the participants. The account, called Yes, You’re Racist, was created in 2012 by Logan Smith, according to CBS News. Originally used as a space to call out casual racism on the internet, Smith shifted his agenda on Saturday after violence broke out at the “Unite the Right” rally.“They’re not wearing masks anymore,” Smith told CBS on Tuesday. “They’re not wearing their hoods. They’re not afraid anymore.”On Saturday, Smith began sharing photos from the rally on his Twitter page, asking his followers (which as of Tuesday are now at over 370,000) to help him track down and identify the white supremacists in the pictures. Among the people exposed were Cole White, who was forced to resign from his job at a Berkeley, California, restaurant and Pete Tefft, whose family disowned him after learning of his involvement in the rally. Peter Cvjetanovic was exposed after a photo of him at the UVA campus rally went viral, becoming synonymous with the anger and hatred of the so-called alt-right, a group attempting to re-insert racism and anti-Semitism into America’s conservative movement. “I’m not the angry racist they see in that photo,” Cvjetanovic told KTVN News after the image gained notoriety over the weekend. While Yes, You’re Racist is inspiring other activists on Twitter to expose white supremacists, Smith has also been criticized for failing to do his due diligence in researching the identities of the participants.Smith has made several mistakes, according to NPR ― he tweeted a photo taken at a Trump rally from several months ago that featured a man wearing a Nazi armband who apparently had done so as a “social experiment.”Smith has also faced criticism from some social media users for using his Twitter popularity to collect donations on Patreon, a crowdfunding site, and for “doxxing,” the act of searching and publishing the private information of individuals on the internet. Defenders of Smith and others who have been actively exposing the men and woman at the rally argue that by entering a public space with their faces clearly visible, the demonstrators should have no expectation for privacy or anonymity. Smith did not respond to a HuffPost request for comment, but his work calling out white supremacists who attended the rally continues. "
32,QUEER VOICES,Fox News Guest Says Confederate And Pride Flags Are 'The Exact Same Thing',Cavan Sieczkowski,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/star-parker-confederate-pride-flag-fox-news_us_5992f6bfe4b09071f69c9887,How about no.,2017-08-15,"Trevor Jackson displays a Confederate flag during a rally held by Sons of Confederate Veterans in Shawnee, Oklahoma, U.S. March 4, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5992f9cb15000064908b6a0b.jpeg?cache=4vRp6csyBP&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A Fox News guest compared the symbolism of the LGBTQ pride flag with the Confederate flag on Tuesday’s “Fox & Friends.” Republican commentator and author Star Parker appeared on Tuesday morning’s episode, during which co-host Steve Doocy asked her about Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi’s statement Monday, which called on President Donald Trump to fire chief strategist Steve Bannon. The remarks came in response to the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend.“What do you think about [Pelosi], who made this statement yesterday: ‘It shouldn’t take the president of the United States two days to summon the basic decency to condemn murder and violence by Nazis and white supremacists,’” Doocy asked. “That is not what happened,” Parker replied. “Nancy Pelosi is exploiting an opportunity that they think will play to their side. On Saturday, there were two sides that were in an American city that were ― then it was escalating very rapidly. No, the question became then, well, do you denounce the one part of it?”Parker said anger over the display of the Confederate flag is, actually, ironic. “But you know what’s really interesting and really incredible irony here is the same people that are demanding that the Confederate flag comes down are the same people that are insisting that the rainbow flag goes up,” she added. “These two flags represent the exact same thing. That certain people groups are not welcome here. So if Nancy Pelosi wants to say that we’re going to start shutting down First Amendment rights of a certain group of people, then what happens the next time that the homosexuals want to walk through an American city and protest and counter protesters come out?”The pride flag was designed by artist Gilbert Baker, who was inspired in part by the reclaiming of the pink triangle ― a symbol used by the Nazis to designate gays ― to design the rainbow flag, whose colors represent everything from healing to harmony.Iterations of Confederate flags, however, have divisive symbolism. Some claim it represents southern pride, but others contend it only represents slavery, oppression and white nationalism. Matthew Guterl, a professor of Africana and American studies at Brown University who studies race post-Civil War, said it’s impossible to separate any positive from the negative. “When someone says it’s about history, well, that particular history is inseparable from hate, because it is about hate,” he told the Washington Post back in 2015. “It’s about racism, and it’s about slavery.”"

But according to Paris Hilton, those women only came forward because they wanted attention. Writer Irin Carmon recently profiled the reality star-turned-mogul (and DJ) for Marie Claire. Hilton spoke to Carmon about her career, her budding, decidedly apolitical feminism ― “I just feel it’s about women’s empowerment and girl power, and I’m very into that” ― and, of course, Trump. Trump has been a family friend to the Hiltons since Paris was a child, and in mid-November it was reported that she had voted for him. (Hilton denied this to Carmon, saying that she didn’t vote at all in the presidential election.) On Thursday morning, Carmon tweeted a screengrab of a part of her transcribed interview with Hilton that addressed Trump. She asked Hilton about Trump’s admission on “The Howard Stern Show” that he had found 12-year-old Hilton attractive, the now-president’s infamous “grab ’em by the pussy” comments and the allegations of sexual assault levied against him. Most of this transcript had not appeared in the profile.Hilton insisted that people just say crazy things on Howard Stern’s show and that “[Trump is] not like that at all, he’s always been so respectful.”When asked about the public accusations of sexual assault made against the president, Hilton dismissed the women as opportunists. “I think that they are just trying to get attention and fame,” she said. “I feel like, a lot of people, when something happens all these opportunists will come out. They want to get money or get paid to not say anything or get a settlement when nothing really happened.”“So I don’t believe any of that,” she continued. “And I’m sure they were trying to be with him too. Because a lot of women, I’ve seen, like him because he’s wealthy and he’s charming and good-looking so I feel like a lot of these girls just made the story up. I didn’t really pay attention to it. I heard a couple things about it. I don’t believe it.” Hilton’s line of thought is one that has been used many times before to dismiss alleged victims of sexual assault (see: Bill Cosby). Projecting an imagined quest for “fame” onto women who come forward about sexual violence and trauma perpetuates the lie that false claims are common. It assumes that the “attention” and “fame” that may come along with accusing a powerful man of sexual assault is something that women desire. “Girl power,” indeed. H/T The Cut"

Damigo was “disappointed” in Trump, but the president’s “statements were vague, they were ambiguous, and oftentimes people in his position will talk that way to skirt around difficult issues,” he said. “When Trump says that he denounces racism, that could mean many different things to different people.” When HuffPost asked a third Spencer associate — who said he was 28 but wouldn’t give his real name, instead calling himself Marcus Aurelius — about Trump’s statement, he said, “Yeah, of course he’s going to do that.” The man added, “It’s the same platitudes over and over.

Douglas Baldridge, Swift’s lawyer, said that the dollar she asked for in damages is “of immeasurable value.” “It means no means no,” Baldridge said on Monday. “And it tells every woman that they will determine what is tolerated with their body.”In a statement published later Monday night, Swift thanked the judge and jury, and announced that she will be donating money to organizations that help survivors of sexual assault in court. “I acknowledge the privilege that I benefit from in life, in society and in my ability to shoulder the enormous cost of defending myself in a trial like this,” she said. “My hope is to help those whose voices should also be heard. Therefore I will be making donations in the near future to multiple organizations that help sexual assault victims defend themselves.” Many of Swift’s fans were overjoyed about the verdict and tweeted just how powerful it was to see Swift receive justice.

She is a graduate student in public policy at the University of Chicago.Note: this article originally appeared in the East-West Center’s Asia Matters for America/America Matters for Asia initiative on August 15, 2017. FIRST Global Robotics Challenge, an international robotics competition in Washington, DC from July 16 to 18, attracted teams of teenagers from 163 countries. The Challenge was founded by inventor Dean Kamen and MIT professor Woodie Flowers, aiming to galvanize an interest in science and technology among youth and promote opportunities to develop necessary science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) skills to conquer modern day challenges.Almost all Asian countries were represented in this global challenge and some of them won several medals in different categories. Among the participants, the Afghan team of six girls drew the most attention. They were rejected for US visas twice, but were eventually granted temporary parole status after President Trump intervened. By attending this competition, the team hopes to show the world that they are passionate about robotics and that the people of Afghanistan should not be viewed as terrorists. The team was awarded a silver medal as part of an award for courageous achievement.A team of four teenagers from Singapore’s Anglo-Chinese School brought home a silver medal in the challenge category. The third place of this category went to a group of seven Indian students. Indonesian Students from the Islamic school TechnoNatura International Madrasah won a silver medal in the innovation category. They have been learning robotics as a part of the school’s curriculum since elementary school. The Brunei Team of six students attended the international competition for the first time as well in hopes of inspiring more students in Brunei to take up STEM education.Approximately one third of international students from Asia at undergraduate or graduate institutions in the United States chose to study science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields in the 2014-15 academic year. Nearly 80% of Indian students study STEM programs in United States in response to the India’s role as a growing technology hub. In March, Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe acknowledged the contributions of India to the development of STEM professionals in the United States during US National Governors Association 2017 winter meeting."

A few hundred people gathered nearby as one of the Christian pastors got ready to speak, rifling through her prayer book. The city’s congresswoman arrived and began the speaking engagement by calling for unity, healing and a time for understanding between people.On Sunday in Dearborn, a throng of everyday citizens gathered after a social media invitation appeared, asking for people to speak out against the hate in Charlottesville, Va.One of the organizers, Mary Kubicek, said, “We literally came up with this while watching Game of Thrones. We were upset about everything happening and just wanted to do something positive.”Faith leaders, civic leaders and everyday citizens answered the call. The American flag was ubiquitous at the event held just outside of the Henry Ford Centennial Library in a memorial park for our veterans.Almost a thousand miles away, the scene was very different. Black, white and brown people were battling on the streets. Men and women armed with Confederate flags and Nazi flags were aligned on one side, beating and intimidating anyone who got too close.Armed fascist militants in gear reminiscent of the Iraq war carried assault rifles through the streets of Charlottesville. Their camouflage uniforms had Confederate and Nazi flag patches to indicate who they were there to fight for. Peaceful protesters, speaking out against hate, were beaten, abused and even mowed down by a vehicle with little to no police protection.Are we living in the same America?The disease of white supremacy is a chronic illness for the United States. We’ve suffered under its yoke since before our independence. What once served the interests of British colonists has evolved, time and again, to serve the interests of a ruling class in the United States.While it’s easy to despair at the moment, believing that this is all new, we must remember we live in the same country where tens of thousands of black persons were lynched for minor offenses or slights. Now, they merely rot in jail.Yet, when one looks at the state of our country where fascism and Nazism is on the rise, it is easy to forget that there are pockets of hope.No hope burns brighter than Dearborn, Michigan. We are a city where Muslims, Christians and people of every color and creed live peacefully side by side. We have our share of problems, but by and large, we are an example for what the rest of America could be like with a bit of effort and an open mind.In the aimless misery of moments like these, it’s easy to forget that we, everyday citizens, can be a part of the solution. A candidate for city council in Dearborn, Leslie Herrick, spoke at the event and laid the road map for a better America.“Those of you who are here know that what we have here in Dearborn is special. We all have a story: our families all came from somewhere else,” Herrick said. “We can be examples to the rest of the country. We can each be an ambassador. When we talk to our friends and relatives in other parts of the state, in other parts of the country: tell our story!”Dearborn’s story is a story worth telling. Dearborn was once the most racist bastion of the North. Our former mayor, Orville Hubbard, was a buffoon whose racist comments were published far and wide. He enjoyed the negative publicity and many of the citizens either agreed with him or simply looked the other way because the streets were swept on time.Yet on Sunday, our current mayor, Jack O’Reilly, was speaking in front of a diverse crowd denouncing the hatred and bigotry we see elsewhere in the country.Dearborn is a testament to America’s ability to reinvent itself. Where once our police were enforcers of racist segregation, today, they’re praised across the country as an example of how to do community policing right. Where once we were an embattled city closing itself off to our neighbors in Detroit, today we are a place of peace and healing where our citizens pride themselves on our welcoming attitude.And while we’ve long been the victim of false rumors about “Sharia Law” and other such nonsense, the truth is, white supremacists and fascists have a real reason to fear Dearborn. We represent the counter argument to their villainous screed: Dearborn is proof that people of different races, faiths and cultures can get along without losing our way. In fact, one might even say that we’re stronger together.There’s a reason why the right wing will keep writing bad things about Dearborn and why we have to continue speaking out for ourselves and the hope we offer for America. If Charlottesville is the disease, Dearborn is the cure.Author’s Note: I currently am working on Leslie Herrick’s city council campaign, however I was not paid or rewarded in any way for writing this article. Leslie Herrick was not even made aware of this article prior to publication."

The violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, left one counterprotester dead.“Confederate,” the next project from “Game of Thrones” co-creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, drew immediate criticism when it was announced in July. The series will imagine a world where the South prevailed in the Civil War and legal slavery is still allowed to exist. It’s set to go into production after the next and final season of “Game of Thrones” wraps.“We support everybody’s right to express an opinion but the suggestion of irresponsibility on our part is simply undeserved,” the network said in a statement provided to The New York Times on Monday. “HBO has a long history of championing intelligent storytelling and we will approach this project with the same level of thoughtfulness that has always defined our programming. We recognize the sensitivity of this project and will treat it with the respect that it deserves. Our creative partners should be given time to develop the series rather than face prejudgment.”The statement mirrors that which the network issued shortly after the series’ announcement, calling for critics to “reserve judgment until there is something to see.” But the infant series has already prompted criticisms over its timing and potential impact, even before James Alex Fields Jr., 20, rammed his car into a crowd protesting a white supremacist rally on Saturday, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer.Last month, black women on social media, including #OscarsSoWhite creator April Reign, led a discussion with the trending hashtag #NoConfederate to air their criticisms of the series. “We do not want HBO to expend any additional time, money or energy on this idea,” Reign told HuffPost at the time.Other prominent voices chimed in, too. For The Atlantic, Ta-Nehisi Coates countered the network’s defense, writing, “HBO executives themselves judged ‘Confederate’ before they’d seen it ― they had to, as no television script actually exists.” He later continued, ”‘Confederate’ is the kind of provocative thought experiment that can be engaged in when someone else’s lived reality really is fantasy to you, when your grandmother is not in danger of losing her vote, when the terrorist attack on Charleston evokes honest sympathy, but inspires no direct fear.”“It is exhausting to think of how many people at [HBO] said yes to letting two white men envision modern day slavery. And offensive,” writer Roxane Gay tweeted.“Confederate” writers Benioff and Weiss, who are white, and husband-and-wife duo Malcolm Spellman and Nichelle Tramble Spellman, who are black, addressed the controversy in a lengthy interview with New York Magazine last month, promising they would present a thoughtful alternative history.“We knew that we could do something easy, and that there are many, many easy things that we could’ve done,” Weiss said, explaining how he and Benioff sought a “difficult” project as their follow-up to the hit “Game of Thrones.” The two have also faced criticisms of their treatment of slavery in that series, which features a primarily white cast. “Confederate” is not likely to air until 2018 or 2019."
40,POLITICS,Trump Scraps Obama-Era Rule To Protect Infrastructure From Climate-Change Flooding,Chris D'Angelo,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-executive-order-flooding_us_599323d4e4b04b193360926b,"A Republican congressman from Florida has denounced the move as ""irresponsible.""",2017-08-15,"A woman rides her bicycle through a flooded street after Hurricane Matthew, near Jacksonville Beach, Florida, Oct. 8, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59933e7f22000009371a6108.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — Furthering his attack on Obama-era climate policies, President Donald Trump has rescinded a rule that requires federal, state and local agencies to account for rising sea levels caused by climate change and to construct buildings, highways and other infrastructure to withstand flooding.The sweeping change is included in an executive order on federal permitting for infrastructure projects that Trump signed Tuesday in New York City.During an appearance Tuesday, Trump said the existing permitting process is “over-regulated,” calling it “a massive self-inflicted wound.”“No longer will we allow the infrastructure of our magnificent country to crumble and decay,” he said. Eli Lehrer, president of the libertarian think tank R Street Institute, told HuffPost that weakening the flood standard will prove “extremely problematic for taxpayers,” resulting in more structures being built in places where they shouldn’t be.“There’s obviously legitimate things to be done to speed up infrastructure, but saying that we’re not going to pay attention to flood risks is not the way to do it,” Lehrer said. “And while it’s possible more infrastructure will be built... it is also quite likely that a lot of what is built will be destroyed in relatively short order. So this does no good for anybody.”Trump’s order rolls back the Federal Flood Risk Management Standard, which President Barack Obama established via executive order in January 2015. The policy — which the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other agencies have been working to implement — aimed to “reduce the risk and cost of future flood disasters” and “help ensure federal projects last as long as intended,” the White House said in a release at the time. Flood-related damages “are anticipated to increase over time due to the effects of climate change and other threats,” Obama’s order read. “Losses caused by flooding affect the environment, our economic prosperity, and public health and safety, each of which affects our national security.”Environmentalists, lawmakers and watchdog groups were quick to slam the White House’s decision Tuesday as “reckless,” “infuriating” and “irresponsible.”“Repealing the standard would be fiscal mismanagement and wasteful,” the government budget watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense said in a statement. “It would effectively force taxpayers to subsidize construction that puts people and property in harm’s way. This isn’t even penny wise, pound foolish ― it’s just foolish.”Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.) said the move would waste taxpayer dollars and put communities at risk. “When you’re on the front lines like South Florida, we know the importance of having more resilient building codes to protect our infrastructure, especially when taxpayer dollars are used,” Curbelo said in a statement. “This Executive Order is not fiscally conservative, it’s irresponsible, and it will lead to taxpayer dollars being wasted on projects that may not be built to endure the flooding we are already seeing and know is only going to get worse.”Rafael Lemaitre, the public affairs director for the Federal Emergency Management Agency under Obama, told The Hill that the Obama-era standard is the “most significant action taken in a generation” to protect American infrastructure. Eliminating it, he said, is “self-defeating.” “We can either build smarter now, or put taxpayers on the hook to pay exponentially more when it floods,” Lemaitre told the publication. “And it will.”As HuffPost reported in 2015, the standard directs agencies to use the “best-available, actionable hydrologic and hydraulic data and methods that integrate current and future changes in flooding based on climate science” when evaluating what is in the flood plain. It also gives agencies the option of building 2 feet above current base flood elevations for “non-critical” infrastructure and 3 feet above for “critical” infrastructure, or building to the standard of a 500-year flood (a flood with an estimated 0.2 percent chance of happening in any given year).The Trump administration has both dismissed the threat of climate change and moved quickly to derail America’s actions to combat it, in part by rolling back Obama’s Clean Power Plan, a policy limiting greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, and announcing plans to pull the U.S. out of the historic Paris Agreement on climate change. Meanwhile, scientists from 13 federal agencies have concluded in a nearly 700-page draft report that the planet has rapidly warmed over the last 150 years, triggering “many other changes to Earth’s climate.” The report calls it “extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.”"

Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-ceos-forum-charlottesville_us_5993216ce4b0091416403a20,Seven executives on his manufacturing advisory panel have left over Trump's lackluster response to neo-Nazis.,2017-08-15,"Flowers surround a photo of 32-year-old Heather Heyer, who was killed when a car plowed into a crowd of people protesting against the white supremacist Unite the Right rally.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/599322fc15000021008b6ac4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Since Monday morning, seven top executives have quit President Donald Trump’s American Manufacturing Council in protest against his tepid response to a deadly attack by an accused white supremacist following a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.Yet no one has left the president’s other business brain trust.The Strategic and Policy Forum, a council of 16 big-name executives tasked with advising Trump on economic policy, includes some huge consumer brands, making those members more susceptible to public pressure through boycotts. Still, most of them did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment on Tuesday. On Wednesday, however, the Strategic and Policy Forum reportedly disbanded.The fastest responses to HuffPost had tended to come from executives who lead finance and financial services giants that generally don’t count ordinary consumers among their clients.Steve Schwarzman, the billionaire chief executive of the investment goliath Blackstone Group, issued a strongly worded statement on Monday, condemning “bigotry, hatred and extremism” as an “affront to core American values.” But his spokesman told HuffPost he had no plans to leave the council.Mark Weinberger, CEO of the professional services firm EY, put out a similar statement against hate. His spokesman told HuffPost, “There is also no change to Mark’s participation in the forum.”Adebayo Ogunlesi, the chairman and managing partner of the $40 billion investment fund Global Infrastructure Partners, declined to comment.A spokesman for Daniel Yergin said the Pulitzer Prize-winning author and vice chairman of the financial services firm IHS Markit “has been on vacation and is unavailable” to comment.A spokeswoman for Toby Cosgrove, chief executive of the nonprofit hospital chain Cleveland Clinic, explained why he planned to remain on the panel. “At this time, his status has not changed,” she told HuffPost. “He has the ability to access the highest level of government to give direct input on healthcare issues.”Jack Welch, the former chairman of General Electric who now serves as a corporate gadfly and conservative pundit, could not be reached for comment, according to a spokeswoman. “Mr. Welch is on vacation and ... he will not be home until this evening,” she said. “He did not bring his cell phone with him, so I can’t reach him for a comment.”Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, who did not specifically respond to HuffPost, issued a strong rebuke of Trump’s response to the Charlottesville violence in a statement posted on the company’s website. But he indicated that he plans to stay on the Strategic and Policy Forum, according to The New York Times. PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, General Motors CEO Mary Barra, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, Patomak Global Partners CEO Paul Atkins, Boston Consulting Group CEO Rich Lesser, former Boeing Company CEO Jim McNerney and Hoover Institute fellow Kevin Warsh also did not return requests for comment.People protested in New York on Wednesday to demand that Schwarzman and Dimon step down from the council. Over the past few months, three chief executives have resigned from the Strategic and Policy Forum in opposition to other decisions by Trump. In February, then-Uber CEO Travis Kalanick stepped down in hopes of distancing his ride-hailing service from Trump’s executive order barring travelers from several Muslim-majority nations. In May, Tesla and SpaceX chief Elon Musk resigned after Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris climate accord left him “no choice.” Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger also resigned over the president’s decision to pull the U.S. out of the historic climate agreement, which was signed by every country except Syria and Nicaragua.The departures from the manufacturing council began on Monday morning when Merck & Co. CEO Ken Frazier, the only African-American in the group, stepped down “to take a stand against intolerance and extremism.”Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank and Intel CEO Brian Krzanich resigned on Monday evening, hours after Trump gave a press conference in which he said “racism is evil” and called out the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis.On Tuesday, Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, quit the group, tweeting that “It’s the right thing for me to do.” Later that evening, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka also announced his resignation amid mounting pressure from unions in the federation.On Wednesday, Inge Thulin, chief executive of the industrial conglomerate 3M, dropped out after “careful consideration.” Campbell Soup Company CEO Denise Morrison resigned soon after. “Racism and murder are unequivocally reprehensible and are not morally equivalent to anything else that happened in Charlottesville. I believe the President should have been ― and still needs to be ― unambiguous on that point,” Morrison said in a statement. “Following yesterday’s remarks from the President, I cannot remain on the Manufacturing Jobs Initiative.”In response, Trump lambasted Frazier for his company’s high drug prices. He did not call out the other corporate chieftains specifically, but he vowed to replace them in a tweet on Tuesday morning.But it’s not clear that he will. The White House did not replace Klaus Kleinfeld after he stepped down as chief executive of the manufacturing giant Arconic in April and left the council. The administration did not even invite Ford Motor Company CEO Jim Hackett to join the manufacturing council after his predecessor, Mark Fields, retired in May.No one has replaced Kalanick, Musk or Iger on the Strategic and Policy Forum, either.Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

There are those who have lost their work or have been forced to divorce because they have been diagnosed with leprosy. There are those who have been disowned by their families and given no choice but to live in a colony. And there are others who have never tried to leave the colony for fear of discrimination from mainstream society. Their stories made it clear that leprosy needed to be recognized not only as a medical problem but also as a human rights problem. My heart was set on fixing this grave social injustice. And I started to explore ways in which the plight of people affected by leprosy could be recognized by the international community as an issue of human rights. When I visited the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in Geneva in July 2003, Bertrand Ramcharan, the Acting High Commissioner for Human Rights at the time, expressed an understanding that leprosy is a serious human rights problem, but noted that leprosy had never been put on the table. In order to raise awareness about leprosy, The Nippon Foundation began organizing a series of seminars during human rights sessions in Geneva. I ensured that persons recovered from the disease would attend the meeting to have their voices heard. But things did not go so smoothly. On one occasion, we reserved a conference room with a capacity of 50, but in the end, the seminar was attended by only ten people. Nonetheless, I repeatedly returned to Geneva, held meetings, and organized small photo exhibitions. The year 2004, however, marked a change in awareness. In March that year, I was given the opportunity to make a statement about “Leprosy and Human Rights” at the plenary session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR). I was allotted three minutes to make the first officially recorded statement on “Leprosy and Human Rights” at the United Nations before 53 nation delegations. I would like to think that this statement was the beginning of a long process to change social awareness of leprosy. Following up on my oral statement before the UNCHR, The Nippon Foundation continued with our UN-related activities. We held special briefing sessions where those affected by leprosy brought attention to the circumstances and history of discrimination in each country. In August 2004, Soli Sorabjee, who was chairman of the Sub-commission of the UNCHR at the time, was moved by the grave situation in his own home country of India and suggested that the Sub-commission should examine the issue of leprosy-related discrimination. The momentum was building. In August 2005, I was again given the opportunity to speak at the Sub-commission of the UNCHR. This time, too, I only had three minutes. Four persons from India, Nepal and Ghana who had recovered from the disease accompanied me and I asked them to make a statement. It was their first experience to speak at such a venue, and they trembled with surprise and tension. After saying a few words, I handed the microphone to one of them, a woman from India. She stood up and said, “I once had leprosy.” It was a powerful testimony that enlightened us to leprosy-related discrimination. I could sense the mood in the hall had changed. One by one, they nervously but resolutely began to talk about the discrimination they had faced. We went over the time limit, but no one stopped them, and everyone remained absorbed. Over the next few months, due to the reorganization of The UN Commission on Human Rights into the Human Rights Council, the situation stalled. Meanwhile, The Nippon Foundation approached the Japanese government to propose “leprosy-related human rights problems” for official deliberation at the Human Rights Council. My role was to explain the proposal and persuade the member countries of the Council. In June 2008, the resolution based on the proposal of Japanese government was unanimously passed by the 59 countries of the Human Rights Council. The resolution called for establishing principles and guidelines to facilitate the elimination of leprosy-related discrimination. In September 2010, the Human Rights Council unanimously passed a resolution that included principles and guidelines. And in December that year, at the UN General Assembly in New York, the resolution as well as the “Principles and guidelines for the elimination of discrimination against persons affected by leprosy and their family members” proposed by the Japanese government were unanimously adopted by the 193 member countries of the United Nations. Although these resolutions have no binding power, they were made with resolve. They have given great hope to many person affected by leprosy."

But as we return to normalcy, we must remember that the hatred felt so violently this weekend is, in many ways, normal — we are responsible for defining a new and better Charlottesville and a new and better America.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59913436140000171aed0800.jpg?ops=crop_191_35_608_463%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Today, you are headed back to work, back to “normal” life.But you are still angry.Maybe you thought this could never happen, especially not in our quaint little Charlottesville, the “happiest city in America.” Maybe this is just the last straw in your long-building rage over a racist, bigoted, intolerant America that everyone else is now finally forced to admit exists. Maybe you are still too shocked to know what part of this makes you most angry.You go back to work today, but you want to do something with your anger. You feel like you must ease the tightening and heaviness in your chest. Maybe you want to go punch a Nazi. Maybe you just want to pray.If you are angry, if you are in any way outraged, you must pass it on.It is too late to prevent racism, anti-semitism, and hatred of many kinds from being normalized in America. They have contaminated our very life-blood since before the birth of this nation. They are normal America. Love, understanding, equality and justice — shared universally among all citizens — that is the exception, the American pipe dream.It is very difficult to repair a home built on a fractured foundation, on the bones of enslaved peoples and Native Americans and immigrant workers. Especially a home as old as America. It takes energy and passion and a willingness to sit down and talk peaceably and open-mindedly with our ideological others.But we don’t have the momentum for those kinds of conversations yet. Most Americans are just opening their eyes to the filthy underbelly of a beast they thought long-dead. It is a terrifying thing to have your worldview, especially one rosier than reality, challenged so violently. Psychologists refer to the rejection of new facts in favor of preserving our comfortable and familiar conceptualization of the world as the “backfire effect.” It is very difficult to overcome unless this new, uncomfortable fact is simply indisputable.For many, news reels showing Confederate and Nazi flags waved proudly by armed men in camo and riot gear, the beating of a young unarmed black man by a pack of KKK, and the stomach-churning, lethal ramming of a Dodge Charger into a crowd of peaceful counter-protestors — bodies flying — will do the trick.The risk that remains, however, is the tendency for humans, when finally forced to accept an uncomfortable fact, to justify it as merely an exception to the norm. America, this is the norm. There are and have always been racists, anti-semites, and white nationalists in our midsts. They felt oppressed by the civil rights reforms of the 20th century, but that just gave them time to stew in their hate and ignorance and pass them on to the next generation — more quietly than before, but never in complete silence. The pot has finally boiled over again, but it has been heating up for a very, very long time.Today you will feel a pull toward normalcy, toward the relief of the routine, toward comforting pursuits. You will find ways to quell your outrage, be they rants on social media, eating and talking and crying with friends, or sitting in prayer or respectful silence for Heather Heyer, Berke Bates, H. Jay Cullen and the 19 injured. Do these things. They are part of loving and healing within Charlottesville and between every person that stands with us.But do not let them satisfy your outrage and indignation. Share the repulsion you feel at being a part of a nation with racism woven into the fibers of its constitution as much as your repulsion at the militant exhibition of KKK and Nazis on American soil in 2017. Speak with your neighbors and coworkers about the burning you felt in your heart and your gut at seeing swastikas sewn on the flags and tattooed on the chests of Americans 70-odd years after their grandfather’s brothers and classmates and neighbors and 6 million innocent Jews lost their lives to Nazi Germany.When you hold the police accountable for failing to respond in an adequate fashion to heavily armed, violent protestors, do so in the context of the countless police shootings of black children and in contrast to the overwhelming police response to Black Lives Matter protests, everywhere from Baton Rouge to NYC. When you describe in a shaky voice the clear malice — not “fear” — of James Alex Fields Jr. in his alleged terrorist attack of unarmed U.S. citizens on American soil, of my fellow students on the ground I walk, you remind the world that the majority of these acts are committed by right-wing extremists, born and raised in America — not immigrants, not Muslims. You demand he be tried as a terrorist, not merely a murderer.At 3 p.m. ET Saturday, shortly after the first footage of James Alex Fields Jr.’s car plowing through civilians was released, I listened to our president address me and the rest of the nation on the unfolding tragedy. He refused to name the perpetrators — the white supremacists, in case that needs any clarification — of this and the many other acts of violence committed that day, merely citing violence “on both sides” in the riots that broke out. Both sides did not kill a 32-year-old woman peacefully standing against hate in her community. Both sides do not regard some American citizens as less-than-human based solely on the color of their skin or the God that they pray to. Both sides do not want love and peace.Do not let today be a normal Monday. Normalcy means more racism, more fascism, more anti-semitism, more hatred and more violence. Today is a day to feed your outrage and channel it toward progress. We must force America to confront its demons — past and present — to make our city and our country better than it has ever had the bravery to be."
46,POLITICS,Charlottesville: What Trump Said By Not Saying Anything,"Martie Sirois, ContributorTGNC advocate, founder of S.E.A.R.CH., mom of 3, www.gendercre...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/charlottesville-what-trump-said-by-not-saying-anything_us_5991a3cce4b0ed1f464c0c7c,"On August 12th, 2017, an act of domestic terrorism propelled by racists and white nationalists occurred in Charlottesville",2017-08-14,"<p><em>White nationalists carry torches on the grounds of the University of Virginia, on the eve of a planned Unite The Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia </em></p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5991a5af22000046001a5c92.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On August 12th, 2017, an act of domestic terrorism propelled by racists and white nationalists occurred in Charlottesville, Virginia. I’m calling it domestic terrorism propelled by racists and white nationalists (or white supremacists), because it’s time (for white people, in particular) to name this for what it is. And while it may be legal for white supremacists to express their alt-right, morally repugnant views, it is absolutely unacceptable to do so in this day and age. It’s far beyond time for all Americans (but most especially white Americans) to use our privilege, our platforms, and our collective, rhetorical power to denounce racism, and to say that it is absolutely unacceptable for anyone to be a white supremacist, or neo-Nazi, or alt-right member in 2017 America. We cannot afford the normalization of this anymore.What originally started with members of the alt-right conducting a “rally to unite the right” and protesting against the removal of a Robert E. Lee statue, ended tragically with a driver smashing into a line of cars, causing a chain reaction that killed one person and injured at least nineteen others, who were peacefully counter-protesting the white nationalist gathering. 20-year-old James Alex Fields was the driver, who now stands charged with second degree murder.James Alex Fields was also identified in a photograph, standing with and being part of the “blood and soil” white supremacist group, Vanguard America. Their manifesto includes core beliefs like, Our America is to be a nation exclusively for the White American peoples who out of the barren hills, empty plains, and vast mountains forged the most powerful nation to ever have existed. Though they quickly denounced Fields’ actions, and they claim to be pro-law and against criminal activity, they still push ""alt-right,"" violence-inciting rhetoric. Another core belief listed in their manifesto reads: The ideal structure of a family is one in which a hard-working father and nurturing mother instill strong values in the children of our nation. This family structure is, and has proven to be, the strongest core foundation for any nation, and thus any assault on the family must be met with swift and decisive action. We realize that equality does not exist in nature, and a government based in the natural law must not cater to the false notions of equality.This same type of hard-working, tough guy imagery was often implied and romanticized by Trump throughout his campaign trail, (“The forgotten men of America,” anyone?) and this is precisely the type of rhetoric known to ramp up the blood pressure, and embolden previously dormant violent tendencies of the ""alt-right"" racists, and white nationalists in general. It was, after all, during Trump’s announcement of his candidacy for President of The United States that he called Mexicans “rapists,” among other bad things, and his rhetoric all just continued spiraling downwards from there. Of course, only his base ate this up, but it was harmful to everyone because it further perpetuated the public misconception that crime is correlated to immigration, particularly, illegal immigration.Of course Trump’s message resounded with this despicable group of vile sub-humans. The blame for Charlottesville lies squarely on Trump’s shoulders. This is his America, whether he wants it or not. This is the monster he created. Anyone who thinks that there’s no correlation between a.) people planning and willingly going to Charlottesville without donning hoods or masks, openly protesting the removal of a confederate statue, and b.) the legacy of Donald Trump’s candidacy for POTUS, is simply exposing a high level of idiocy.Just think about what the people who came to Charlottesville to protest were actually protesting: the removal of the statue of a man who led the Confederate Army to defend slavery, who married into the wealthiest slave-owning family in Virginia, and whose ideology was white supremacy. Robert E. Lee was a man who, in a letter to his wife regarding slaves, famously stated, “The blacks are immeasurably better off here than in Africa, morally, socially & physically. The painful discipline they are undergoing, is necessary for their instruction as a race, & I hope will prepare & lead them to better things. How long their subjugation may be necessary is known & ordered by a wise Merciful Providence.”These white supremacy groups in Charlottesville were protesting the taking down of a statue of that man, which coincidentally, was erected in 1924, just as the second resurgence of the KKK was happening. This is significant because in the 1920s, post WWI, white Americans were becoming more and more bitter and resentful over immigration and the idea that immigrants were taking jobs away from them, and they were worried that immigrants and people of color were diluting the (myth of) “racial purity” of American society as a whole. Basically, a bunch of white supremacists had irrational paranoia over losing their power, their status, and their country.If that sounds familiar, it’s because now, we have the third rising of the KKK (which has been growing steadily, and even more so since the 1960s). Only this time, they’re carrying citronella tiki torches into the the night, and they’re emboldened by Trump and his ilk to show their hoodless, maskless faces. The correlation between Donald Trump’s presidency parading in on the coattails of his open, inflammatory, hateful rhetoric like a reality freak show, and the willingness of white supremacists to show their faces in public is no coincidence.This rhetoric appeals to people in the same way the NRA does, as well as Breitbart News, Fox News, and right-wing talk radio programs like Rush Limbaugh. This toxic rhetoric is making white people think they are being overpowered and outnumbered by different races and liberals, and further, that their lives are somehow in danger. It’s just time for white people to have a serious conversation and face the fact that their paranoia, and frankly, their insecurities about America being overwhelmed by the likes of immigrants, liberals, muslims, and black people, is simply ridiculous. In 2017, America is still dominated by white people, conservatives, and Christianity. They still dominate government, too, with Republicans controlling The White House, both houses of Congress, The Supreme Court, and most of the country’s governorships. That these white (men, mostly) have the gall to act like a besieged minority is mind-blowing.Fields’ mother, appearing somewhat bewildered after hearing the news of her son, said she knew her son was attending a rally. She also said that her son had mentioned “alt-right,” but she didn’t know what that meant. When it was explained to her that the ""alt-right"" was composed of white supremacists, she said, “I didn’t know it was white supremacist, I thought it had something to do with Trump.” When she then stated with authority, “Trump’s not a supremacist,” you could almost hear the collective gasps of everyone, everywhere, who has been calling out Trump’s racism, xenophobia, and all the other ‘isms’ and phobias he has failed to condemn since day one.Fields’ mother also explained that she didn’t get involved with her son’s politics, specifically, that she tried to “stay out of his political views.” And that’s where we have a huge, reoccurring problem: She didn’t know. She either didn’t know, didn’t care to know, or pretended not to know that her son was a Trump fan, and an ""alt-right"" fan. While many Trump voters surprised us by being Trump voters, their votes still may have come from good intentions, however misguided. But the divide between human beings with moral decency, and those who are ""alt-right"" is not subtle. Furthermore, stances taken by the ""alt-right"" (and by association he has yet to condemn, Trump) are not even about politics in the first place – they’re about whether one embraces the collective moving forward of society towards a common honorable goal, or the moving backwards of society to a romanticized past that never actually existed. Forwards, or backwards. Progressive, or regressive. Decent human beings, or the ""alt-right."" It really is that cut and dry.The fact that James Alex Fields’ mother didn’t know leads directly to this point: White families actually need to have the difficult conversations nobody wants to have. White people need to come to the kitchen table and discuss hard topics like systemic racism, the many faces and intersections of privilege, the unfair stigma of mental illness, the problems with reinforcing a cisgender, heteronormative culture while not teaching diversity, and even stuff as seemingly trivial as the ever-shifting, evolving cultural language our teenage youth are adopting.White families, who by skin color are automatically endowed with white privilege, regardless of class, need to shift out of their comfort zones and honestly discuss their values and ideals. They need to admit and confront their fears and insecurities, their non-negotiables, and even (and especially) their political views, if for no other reason than that anyone’s child could be the next James Alex Fields, and any parent could remorsefully claim, “I just didn’t know.”As this news of white supremacists, ""alt-right,"" and racism apparently sunk in some time later, Fields’ mother on-camera said, “I mean, he had an African-American friend! I mean, so…” and then trailed off, with a somewhat uncomfortable, disbelieving kind of chuckle. Laughable, because in her mind surely her son wasn’t associated with racists or white supremacists – look, he has a black friend; that proves he’s not racist!That type of reasoning is exactly on par with someone saying, “I’m not homophobic, I have gay friends,” or “I’m not transphobic” but then using transphobic language such as “sex change,” “transvestite,” or “transgendered” (which is no more a real word than “gayed,” or “straighted”). So her argument, implying that her son couldn’t possibly be racist or white supremacist because he had “an African American friend,” is the perfect case in point for the statement: Just because you have black friends doesn’t automatically mean you’re not racist. In fact, it’s a terrible excuse for racism.This was the first major episode of deadly domestic terrorism to occur under the reign of President Trump. From the beginning of his campaign, Donald Trump has chosen not to deal with the topic of racism head-on, if at all, though he was more than happy to chide and even taunt former President Obama in ways like starting the (very racist, very untrue) “birther” conspiracy theory. In fact, it’s very telling that it took people like former President Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton, who didn’t win the presidency, to denounce this act of racism on social media long before the sitting President did – a man who, on a normal day, sends out tweets like dandelion seeds in a gust of wind. Trump’s very late response to the events that unfolded in Charlottesville seemed forced; He appeared before TV cameras begrudgingly, emotionless, his eyes not leaving the prepared script, much like the way a ten year old child might read a written, forced apology for kicking their 5th grade nemesis on the playground. That is, until Trump got to the the part where he said bigotry was being seen “on many sides, on many sides.” For that part, he looked up and returned to his usual tone of voice. That part seemed to be a last minute ad lib, to sort of defiantly go rogue and throw in a promise to his base (with a wink and a nod) that he was still with them. After that, basically everyone not in his base tuned out and disregarded the rest of that ill-penned, pitiful and vague speech.It was a huge missed opportunity and a complete failure on the President’s part. And yet, it seems like this is all unfolding perfectly, according to Trump’s plan. That during this pitiful speech he got to tout the phrase, “What is vital now is a swift restoration of law and order and the protection of innocent lives,” sounded less like denouncing white supremacy and more like a rallying cry for Americans to get behind this insinuated “need” for us to extend manpower and militarize the police in our streets. Trump has already made sweeping attempts to take away the freedom of the press, and freedom of speech. Perhaps removing freedom of assembly is the next constitutional right he’ll chip away at.These are all things many believe to be part of Trump’s ultimate endgame – which, as many people have noted, is frighteningly the exact same thing Hitler did. Hitler posed as a “traditional values” man, a champion of law and order. The Nazi police liked to take preventative action, making arrests based on suspicion or whim, beating people into submission with no oversight from the courts, etc. When Hitler and the Nazi party gained traction, they were easily able to take away basic human rights that had already been granted, including freedom of the press, freedom of speech, and freedom of assembly, for starters. What Trump is doing is nothing new.After that pitiful speech on Saturday, many were vocal over the fact that he didn’t name the attack for what it was – an act of domestic terrorism propelled by racists and white nationalists. All over the news and social media, people were calling for Trump to denounce white supremacy immediately. But he never did. In addition to his pathetic speech which actually said more with its silence than with its words, Trump now can add, “shows moral cowardice in the face of domestic terrorism” to his report card.But why would we expect anything different? This is who he is. This is who he was all over the campaign trail. We are merely reaping the consequences now of electing a white supremacist. We are reaping the consequence of his actions, like surrounding himself in The White House with influential figures like Steve Bannon and Sebastian Gorka, who are known white supremacists. We see their white nationalist influence on Trump when we see something like his response to what just happened. We see it in the way he seemed to bend over backwards to try and not call a spade a spade, by not naming the act, and by not saying that it was a racially motivated act of domestic terror.Saturday’s speech was a display of Trump simply going through the motions because people forced his hand. The “White House-issued” clarification later (issued by an unnamed White House spokesman) was laughable, claiming that when he condemned bigotry, Trump was including racism and white supremacy. But Trump didn’t say it himself. He never looked into the camera and said to his country, “I condemn white supremacy, racism, and Neo-nazis.” Some assistant issued a statement claiming he condemns them. For it to be believed, though, Trump has to say it and do it himself, through both words and actions. Sadly however, I’d argue there’s no need to wait for him to publicly denounce white supremacy. That’s because, as time has proven over and over again, we need only to look at his actions, not his words. Unfortunately, his actions have always either failed his words, or confirmed his silence.Of course, the roots of what happened in Charlottesville didn’t start with Trump; they go back to the founding of our country. Racism has always been present, but there are also figures who emerge and seem to fan its flames over the years. We saw this when white people began protesting the election of our first black President in 2008. And Donald Trump was listening. In that audience he found a well and tapped into it. He built his entire campaign platform on the foundation of a disobedient, rogue, enabling environment, one that incited and welcomed violence on the campaign trail, which then spilled over into his presidency. During his gratuitous, self-congratulatory “thank you tour” to the states who showed their Trump loyalty by voting him in, Trump continued this rhetoric. And by then, he was already full-tilt into building his cabinet with known white supremacists who would greatly influence him.The responsibility now for all of us white people, whether we voted for him or not, is to consistently and perpetually point out how abnormal all of this is, and how this is fundamentally NOT what our country stands for. We must have the difficult conversations with our family around the kitchen table. We must call and write our representatives, local and otherwise, to state our discontent. We must complain to them about the normalization of white supremacists in The White House - white supremacists who are attempting to make policies across the boards that are gradually dismantling our individual rights and undermining our defining American values and ideals.We have to do more. We have to demand more. We deserve more. Let the American people speak whenever Donald Trump goes silent. Actually, let the American people speak, particularly, the decent white people who say they’re not racist. Let those Americans speak. Period. Originally published at www.gendercreativelife.com"

Risen will also join The Intercept, the First Look Media news organization launched in 2014 by journalists Glenn Greenwald, Jeremy Scahill and Laura Poitras and backed by billionaire eBay founder and philanthropist Pierre Omidyar. At the Intercept, Risen will serve as senior national security correspondent, writing a column based on his own reporting, and help steer the site’s investigative work. “I am incredibly excited by this amazing and unique opportunity to combine my journalism with efforts to defend press freedom,” Risen said in a statement. “I am honored to help lead the fund as both America and the world face unprecedented threats to freedom of the press, while also writing and reporting and helping [Intercept editor-in-chief] Betsy Reed and her incredible team continue to turn The Intercept into one of the most important investigative reporting outlets in the nation.” Risen, 62, was among the most prominent journalists to leave the New York Times last month in the paper’s latest round of buyouts. Times executive editor Dean Baquet described Risen at the time as “one of the giants of national security and investigative reporting.”In nearly two decades at the Times, Risen delved deeply into national security, intelligence, and surveillance matters. He was part of a Pulitzer Prize-winning team delving into the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and won a second Pulitzer with colleague Eric Lichtblau for their 2005 investigation into the National Security Agency’s secret domestic spying program.Risen also battled attempts by both the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations to compel him to reveal a confidential source for a botched CIA plot described in his 2006 book, State of War: The Secret History of the CIA and the Bush Administration. Risen, whose legal fight finally ended in 2015, has expressed concern that the Obama administration laid the groundwork for the targeting of journalists under President Donald Trump.“There is no journalist better equipped to cover the national security scandals and abuses of the Trump era than Jim Risen,” Reed said in a statement. “We’re honored and thrilled to have the country’s leading national security journalist bring his vast experience and vision to our team at this critical time,” she added. The Intercept was co-founded by journalists at the forefront of reporting on the disclosures from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, and the site has quickly distinguished itself for aggressive coverage of national security issues.But the site also came under fire in June following accusations that its reporters failed to protect contractor Reality Leigh Winner, the alleged source of top secret NSA document revealing Russian hacking efforts ahead of the 2016 presidential election.Following an internal review, Reed said that “at several points in the editorial process, our practices fell short of the standards to which we hold ourselves for minimizing the risks of source exposure when handling anonymously provided materials.” The company announced last month that First Look’s Press Freedom Defense Fund would help provide support for Winner’s legal defense, a role it intends to play for journalists and whistleblowers in future cases. First Look Media president Michael Bloom cited Risen’s first-hand experience in a statement on the company’s newly created defense fund role. “Jim is not only a respected journalist who was prepared to sacrifice his own freedom to protect a source,” he said, “but a very real example of how the press can challenge those in power who misuse laws to fulfill a political agenda.” "

We don’t need a wall, we need a mirror.I’ve heard commentators say, “Maybe the Republicans and their supporters are getting exactly what they deserve,” but what about the rest of us. All that talk about wanting a straight shooter has left America with a President who cavalierly talks about firing rockets at two different countries at the same time. Haven’t we seen how this story plays out already? Jesus Christ, how short are your memories? Look at what is going on across this country. White supremacists are openly marching in the streets, openly appearing on cable news, and openly occupying the highest levels of the U.S. government. This cannot be the new normal. This is 2017, not 1963. We cannot allow these separatists to be sanitized by calling them things like the alt-right or white nationalists, these are white supremacists. These are racist separatists. These are our grandparents’ worst nightmare in chinos and $75 haircuts. We cannot allow ourselves be gaslit into submission. We cannot allow ourselves to be gaslit into complacency. We are at a fork in the road. For years Democrats have lampooned and mocked the extreme right as rednecks and inbreds. We didn’t take them seriously, why would we? In my lifetime there has been so much progress, why would I ever think that we would go backwards? Well, that’s exactly what is going on in front of our very eyes. We’re watching the rise of white supremacists and being told that it’s just our imagination. We can’t ignore what we’re witnessing. As white supremacists march across college campuses with racist flags, assault weapons, and torches, right wing news networks inundate their viewers with selective images of black protesters surrounded by militarized police. As Republican political pundits defend the president joking about violence against minorities, the President of the United States refuses to speak out about the bombing of a mosque in Minnesota. As our country continues to fracture in an all too familiar fashion, we have to ask ourselves whether we have what it takes to self-correct. Can you imagine the outrage from the right if black people took to the street with weapons, to protest a perceived slight? I can, it consistently ends with the local police dressed like seal team six and white pundits referring to the protesters and “thugs” and “criminals.” Let’s not pretend we’ll see the same outrage from those pundits when it comes to Charlottesville. That would actually require principles.The rise of white supremacists didn’t happen overnight, it’s an illness that’s been consistently fed. Men like Pat Buchanan, Newt Gingrich, and their millennial remixes, have helped to create an environment conducive to joking about internment camps on national tv. Political pundits like Tomi Lahren, pundits who speak without considering the consequences or basing their opinions on anything close to a fact, have become the norm. Republicans have to ask why in 2017 white supremacists feel comfortable marching in public without hoods on. In the age of social media and camera phones. Why are white supremacists unconcerned with the potential consequences of their actions? In 2017, why are Republicans slow to criticize flying the Confederate flag, but quick to question the patriotism of Colin Kaepernick? Where does the political hackary end and consistent political policy begin?I’m sure I’ll make a lot of enemies saying this, but we have to start taking attendance and naming names. We can’t allow the loudest voices to be the only voices heard. We can’t allow people in search of nothing other than fame and fortune to pull this country apart at the seams. I know too many rational, well-intentioned Republicans to believe that these intellectual frauds represent the entire party. Republicans have to speak up and speak out against the vitriol on display. America needs Republicans to put politics aside now more than ever. This isn’t about left or right, this is about right and wrong. I woke up this morning to scenes of the Klu Klux Klan and white supremacists attacking members of the clergy on my TV. My first thought was, “Is that what it looks like when America is made great again?” To wake up to that in 2017 is wrong. Period. We are not our grandparent’s generation and we do not have to fight the same battles. We don’t need a wall, we need a mirror."

Luther Strange, R-Ala., speaks with a supporter after the U.S. Senate candidate forum </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5991afb62200001a001a5cb5.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Sara SwannNineteen candidates are contesting tomorrow’s primary for Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ old seat as U.S. Senator for Alabama, but few have made an impression on Alabamians.Current Sen. Luther Strange (R-Ala.) is miles ahead in terms of money raised. Strange, formerly the state’s Attorney General, was appointed to the Senate in February by Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley, who has since resigned in scandal. As of July 26, Strange has raised more than $3.2 million for his campaign — six times the amount of his closest competitor. Two-thirds (almost $2.2 million) of Strange’s total campaign funds have come from large individual contributions, and nearly all the rest ($916,000) has come from PACs. With such a large pool of donations, Strange has been able to spend more than $2.2 million, with most of that money going toward ads.Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.), who currently serves Alabama’s 5th District in the House of Representatives, has raised the next highest amount with a total of about $540,000. Brooks has also received a majority of his funds from large individual contributions. Since he already had a campaign account to draw on, Brooks has been able to spend almost double what he has raised, with a disbursement total of nearly $940,000.Another frontrunner, former Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore, raised just under $460,000 as of three weeks ago. Moore, a favorite of Alabama’s evangelical voters, was suspended from his position as chief justice of the state’s Supreme Court in May 2016 after refusing to comply with the U.S. Supreme Court’s nationwide legalization of same-sex marriage. Moore has had the most success with small donors, but still received 65 percent of his money from large individual donors. Unlike Brooks and Strange, he reports receiving no contributions from PACs. So far, he has spent roughly $286,000 while campaigning for senator.Strange, Brooks and Moore espouse similar policies but differ in their branding. With support from his colleagues in the Senate, Strange has become the establishment candidate, raking in nearly all the PAC money. Brooks also has a Washington flavor to his campaign because of his experience in the House, but portrays himself as the conservative alternative to Strange. Moore, the only frontrunner who has not worked on the Hill, has had an anti-Washington theme to his campaign.The three Republicans have also fought to prove who is most loyal to President Donald Trump. Ultimately, Strange received Trump’s endorsement. Strange has also been the favorite of Mitch McConnell’s super PAC, the Senate Leadership Fund, which has spent more than $2.7 million in support of Strange and against Brooks and Moore.A majority of the SLF’s spending has been dedicated to attack ads. Over the past month, SLF has produced 10 ads related to the Alabama special election, according to its YouTube account. Seven of these ads have been attacking Brooks, capitalizing on clips of him saying “you can’t trust Trump with anything he says” and that people who voted for Trump will regret it. The two ads targeting Moorewere focused on his six-figure salary as chief justice. The 10th, and most recent, ad is a six-second clip about Trump’s endorsement of Strange.Brooks has defended himself against these SLF ads, saying he does support Trump and even donated $2,500 “to help President Trump Win.” However, this is slightly misleading, as Brooks’ leadership PAC donated to the Republican Party of Alabama, not Trump’s campaign. According to the Center for Responsive Politics’ Donor Lookup database, Brooks also made a $5,000 donation to the state GOP from his own pocket.Of the other 16 candidates, only three have raised over $100,000, and seven haven’t even filed an FEC report. One of the seven unsuccessful fundraisers is Mary Maxwell, a Republican who moved from Australia to Alabama just to campaign for the open Senate seat. Despite living internationally for the last 40 years, Maxwell meets all of the requirements to run: She is at least 30 years old, she is a U.S. citizen, and she has lived in Alabama for at least one day.It has been 20 years since Alabama last had a Democratic senator, and Trump won the state last November by almost 30 points. As a result, the focus in this election has rarely strayed from the Republican candidates. Even though a Democratic victory is a long shot, Soren Jordan, an assistant professor of political science at Auburn University, said the lack of interest from the national Democratic Party is still “pretty astonishing.”As with Democrat Jon Ossoff’s expensive, ultimately unsuccessful, campaign in the Georgia 6 special election earlier this summer, Jordan said he expected the Democratic Party to also pick a favorite in the Alabama election. But they have yet to do so, and without national support, the Democratic candidates have struggled to keep up.“This [election] is really the last gauge for either party before the 2018 season really heats up,” Jordan said. “But Democrats don’t really seem to be treating it that way, allowing a field of (admittedly long-shot) candidates to run through the primary with little cohesion or direction.”The top fundraiser for the Democrats in the Alabama Senate race is former U.S. Attorney Doug Jones with less than $288,000. Jones was recently endorsed by former Vice President Joe Biden. The other four Democratic candidates who have raised money are even farther behind, each with totals under $30,000. One of those candidates, however, has led Jones in several polls thanks to name recognition: Robert Kennedy Jr., who is unrelated to the more famous Kennedy family.The Democratic and Republican primaries on Aug. 15 will trim down this long list of candidates. If no candidate for a party receives more than 50 percent of the vote, the top two from that party will take part in a September run-off election to determine the nominees for the general in December.Jordan said it is highly unlikely any candidate will garner more than 50 percent. Moore was at 35 percent support in a poll by the Trafalgar Group on Aug. 11, with 17 percent still undecided, according to The Hill. Strange was well behind at 23 percent, with Brooks still in the running at 20 percent.If Moore and Brooks are able to freeze Strange out of the run-off, the senator would become a lame duck. “If Strange isn’t up in the general, or even in the run-off, he becomes a potential target for Senate Democrats looking to build bipartisan solutions to health care, tax reform, and a host of other policy issues,” Jordan said.Turnout for the primary elections on Tuesday is not expected to be high. Without a presidential election on the ballot to boost interest, the primaries will most likely see about 20 to 25 percent of voters participate, according to Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill. An ordinary primary in Alabama tends to have 30 to 32 percent voter participation."

Flint Mayor Karen Weaver said in March that it could be years before the water in the city is safe to drink again.“Ongoing challenges remain years later for Flint residents, and it’s important that we don’t forget our brothers and sisters affected by this disaster,” Mars said in a follow-up statement after the show. “As people, especially as Americans, we need to stand together to make sure something like this never happens in any community ever again.”Isaiah Oliver, president of the Community Foundation, expressed his gratitude to Mars for his “inspiring donation.” Mars is one of many celebrities who have donated to the Flint crisis. Others include Cher, Eminem, Mark Wahlberg and Puff Daddy."

The womenfolk are cooking dinner in the house, while you and your buddies are outdoors solving the problems of the world. Or maybe you’re a dairy farmer in Wisconsin, a retired coal miner in West Virginia, a former steel worker in Ohio who’s trying to support his family with less, or a trucker in Tennessee whose mind is usually quite alone with this thoughts, or a group of retirees in Florida who are just sure they have all the answers to life’s questions. Where is your head right now about current events?As these people survey the carnage of #Charlottesville, there is likely a certain unity among their thinking, and it sounds a lot like this, “Well, what did you expect?” The reading of history by Donald Trump’s white Christian supporters includes a number of “losses” ― some deeply personal ― as years of efforts to right wrongs have ticked along. Nobody likes to lose, but this particular mindset is umbrage-gone-to-seed, a form of deep-seated resentment that produces contempt of a violent nature. For example, in the zero-sum game of competition for limited jobs, where the activity is tilted in any way to correct cultural wrongs, there will be winners and there will be losers. The Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement is a highly visible example to them. A great many white people resent the slogan and consider the group racist and a hate group for its outspoken disdain for police officers ― typically white police officers ― who’ve shot and killed black citizens regardless of the justification or lack thereof. To these people, simply saying “it’s not” racism or hatred isn’t good enough. They are unconvinced.This is the tragedy of the weekend’s events, for honest condemnation of violence is hard when you see it as inevitable and based on a false and biased reading of history. And what’s truly astonishing to me is that most, if not all of these people profess Christianity as their faith, having completely overlooked admonishments like this one in I John 4: “Whoever claims to love God yet hates a brother or sister is a liar. For whoever does not love their brother and sister, whom they have seen, cannot love God, whom they have not seen.” As my friend and pastor of Lee Park Church in suburban Charlotte Chris Justice said this weekend, “If you claim supremacy based on your race, you are not a Christian,” adding ”The only thing we, as Christians, have supremacy in is Christ!”This is the real evil in the events of the weekend, and talking about it this way may be the best thing we can do to soften the hard line that separates people in this country, the one exploited by Donald Trump in selling his brand of politicking to the public in 2016. Mr. Trump is already running his 2020 campaign, so there’s little likelihood he would disturb his base now by totally denouncing the white supremacists he himself has emboldened. Besides, there is nothing like a good old-fashioned race war to deflect attention from what is really class warfare underway in the U.S. The rich have done a terrific job of taking money from the poor and blaming it on anything or anybody other than their own greed. What better way to hide that than in the chaos of a grassroots summer of violence over race.If the enemy of my enemy is my friend, then all who participated in bringing this madness to the surface are friends with the madness itself. This undeniable truth is offered for the consideration of each and every person who considers themselves members of the political right. If you sleep with evil, you will certainly get at least some it on you, for no unequally yoked partnership moves in two directions at the same time. The correct word for that is hypocrisy. When you choose to express the hidden motives of self-pity and payback in your quest for improving your lot in life, you have already crossed a moral line in the sand, one put there by the Lord you’ve followed all your life in Jesus Christ.Author, speaker, activist, and public theologian Brian McLaren participated in the anti-racism protests in Charlottesville and provided a compelling and detailed account of his observations. He also offered a message to Christians:We Christians, in particular, need to face the degree to which white Christianity has failed – grievously, tragically, unarguably failed – to teach its white adherents to love their non-white neighbors as themselves. Congregations of all denominations need to make this an urgent priority – to acknowledge the degree to which white American Christianity has been a chaplaincy to white supremacy for centuries, and in that way, has betrayed the gospel.Ed Stetzer of Christianity Today returned from an overseas trip just in time to witness #Charlottesville. He wrote:So, as a white evangelical, part of a demographic category who disproportionally supported President Trump, let me start by saying this movement is antithetical to the gospel. It is an abomination to all that we stand for, and it must be condemned on every level of leadership in the Church. There is no room for waffling. We cannot sit in silence hoping this will pass.But how does one do that when the congregation is silently nodding their heads in the other direction? The church has failed miserably by teaching what I call The Gospel of Self and not the words of mercy, justice, and the acceptance of turning the other cheek taught by the One we serve. We’ve forgotten the words quoted in Matthew: “Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.” We’ve far too many Evangelical leaders scattering in the name of worldly prosperity and the lust for power that seems to always be at the root of heretical Christianity. It’s amazing to me that those who preach self-sufficiency are so capable of the expression of self-pity when it comes to so-called losing out on the prosperity, security, and pleasures that the world provides. When you believe and preach that the Bible is a self-help manual to improve your lot in life, you’ve crossed into the very real downstream likelihood of “depart from me, for I never knew you.”President Trump initially responded to #Charlottesville by calling it “an egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides.” In so doing, Trump acknowledged the misdirected anger of these white Christians, but he also justified it by making the case that they have a point, that their views of BLM and immigration aren’t racism but rather a valid reaction to offenses against them. In so doing, he’s validating their self-pity and their irrational fear that more will be taken from them in the future, if they don’t respond today.Those who oppose this demonstration of hatred and violence by the right need only be consistent in their condemnation and let universal disdain do its work. Instead, I’ve seen way too much “I told you so” among those who represent the opposition, as if their war against the cultural rigidity of the right gives them a special place from which to criticize. But being right and taking a position of self-righteousness in human relations are two very different matters, for one simply states facts while the other lords it over others. Waving the white privilege flag during heated emotional displays is like the bullfighter taunting the bull. It can only produce an over-the-top, inappropriate response from which counter protestors cannot entirely escape culpability.Those who argue that there really aren’t “sides” to matters of race don’t do an effective job of deconstructing history or presenting their arguments in such a way that can be understood by all. If life demands that some win and some lose on the path we all must trod, then so be it. But to shut others up while refusing to acknowledge self-interest in your own position is indefensible, and that’s our current conundrum.If you believe in the miracle of creation and in the miracle that is America, please examine your own heart, for neither expresses a single degree of racial preference. That is but a human trait, and that, my friends, is our real enemy.Overcome it we must, ’lest we all be swept away by its corruption."

54,POLITICS,What Went Wrong With The Police Response In Charlottesville,Nick Wing,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/charlottesville-police-response_us_5991de97e4b090964298e5bc,"Officers failed a primary duty of keeping the peace, say law enforcement experts and attendees.",2017-08-14,"Armed militia members look on after Saturday's ""United the Right"" rally in Charlottesville was declared an unlawful gathering. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5991e365140000421aed099e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The typically sedate college town of Charlottesville, Virginia, erupted in chaos on Saturday, as white supremacists clashed with counter-protesters in scenes often resembling all-out street brawls.Far-right extremists, some outfitted with Nazi SS-style helmets and armed with medieval shields and sticks, openly battled demonstrators, including members of anti-fascist, or Antifa, groups. In a horrific climax, a white supremacist allegedly plowed his vehicle into a group of peaceful demonstrators, killing one and injuring at least 19.The attack capped a tumultuous day in which law enforcement allowed the violence to unfold largely unchecked, according to reporters and attendees from both factions. Although officials said they followed their plan to dispatch additional officers and first responders to Charlottesville, law enforcement experts not involved in the melee said police failed to conform to widely accepted best practices for dealing with tense protest environments.This tactical breakdown began early on Saturday, as participants of the planned “Unite the Right” rally ― including members of neo-Nazi and KKK groups ― filed through the streets of downtown Charlottesville on their way to Emancipation Park, in the heart of the city. The park, a one-block town square formerly known as Lee Park, has become a rallying place for white supremacists protesting the planned removal of a statue memorializing Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.Many police officers had already gathered in the square that morning, forming a barricade to break up the groups. That’s a standard technique, said Darrel Stephens, executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Police Association.“In most protest [or] counter-protest situations, the police separate the groups with barriers and by enough distance so they can see and hear each other but not engage in violence,” Stephens told HuffPost in an email.While many officers focused their efforts inside the park, others ― some fully outfitted in riot gear ― stood guard in full view of the violence mounting in the crowd outside. They stood idle, in apparent earshot of requests for them to “do something,” as white nationalists fought their way through throngs of counter-protesters toward the park.“There was no police presence on the streets themselves,” said Brittany Caine-Conley, chief organizer of Congregate Charlottesville, a clergy group dedicated to social justice. “As the alt-right, Nazi groups began to march toward the park, they were often creating pockets of violence.”Officers made little effort to break up the fights, instead remaining in phalanx formation around the barrier, said Caine-Conley.“I even saw some of the police smiling while they were watching the brawls take place,” she added.Before noon, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) declared a state of emergency, mobilizing additional state troopers and Virginia National Guard troops. Police announced the rally had been deemed an unlawful assembly, and threatened to arrest anyone who did not disperse. Protesters and counter-protesters fanned back out into the streets.Now, there was nothing to prevent open confrontations between the factions. White nationalists and counter-demonstrators tore through Charlottesville’s historic downtown mall, many still carrying makeshift weapons, including large flagpoles and wooden signposts, which Stephens said are typically prohibited at protests.Mayhem took over an otherwise pleasant sunny afternoon in the popular pedestrian thoroughfare.“There were people just out enjoying a regular Saturday,” said Kevin Cope, a research assistant professor at the University of Virginia School of Law, who was protesting the white nationalist rally. “All of this just came together with the different groups going off in random directions, and at that point, it’s hard to imagine how police could have been everywhere.”The inability of law enforcement to contain the situation wasn’t due to a lack of manpower, said Cope.“There was clearly a coordinated effort to get as many police officers out there as possible,” he said. “They had armored vehicles driving down the mall. They had probably hundreds of officers, some of whom were in riot gear, some of whom weren’t, but they clearly had some sort of coordinated strategy.”Whatever the strategy was, it didn’t appear to work. During a volatile protest, it’s critical that police work to keep factions separated, especially when violence is “foreseeable,” said former Charlottesville police Chief Tim Longo.“Not only is it a generally accepted policing practice, it’s a well-known policing practice ... when you know that you’re going to have groups that are divergent or groups that have very opposite views, and there’s the potential for violence,” Longo told CNN on Monday.Longo couldn’t explain how a car was able to get through the crowded streets and onto the town’s mall.“I’m shocked, in disbelief that there was traffic anywhere near that level of pedestrian activity,” Longo said. “That street is typically shut down on weekends for events that occur on the mall. I can only assume that it wasn’t in this case, and why, I simply can’t answer that question.”City and state officials have been quick to defend law enforcement’s handling of the protest.“It’s easy to criticize, but I can tell you this, 80 percent of the people here had semiautomatic weapons,” McAuliffe said Saturday, according to the The New York Times, referring to militia groups that came armed with assault-style rifles.The governor stressed that “not a shot was fired” and there was “zero property damage.”Charlottesville Police Chief Al Thomas has said little in response, promising the department will be “reviewing events of the day over coming weeks and months,” according to The Washington Post.Neither Charlottesville police, nor the local chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police, the union that represents Charlottesville officers, responded to HuffPost’s requests for comment.To some Charlottesville residents, however, the message is already clear.“The commentary from communities of color in Charlottesville is that the police have never protected them,” said Caine-Conley. “While the police force says they’re trying to protect the community, it’s been very evident to me that the most marginalized and oppressed people have never been safe and have never been protected.”Andy Campbell and Christopher Mathias contributed reporting."

The Academy Award nominee wrote how she watched women throughout her life (including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during her presidential run) face doubt and criticism from others for wanting to be more than just a wife and mother. Seeing this skepticism, Dern had convinced herself to focus on only one thing at a time to avoid failure.“I’ve spent a lot of my life going, ‘OK, I’m going to be an actress, but I have to give it everything, so I probably won’t be able to also have a successful relationship,’ or ‘I’m about to be a mother, so I’ll give up my acting,’ or ‘I’m married, so I’m going to put my career on hold and be ‘a good wife’ and support him,’” she wrote in the letter.Dern realized her way of thinking had been hindering her and encouraged Jaya to pursue all of her interests with all of her might. The actress also wrote about beauty standards and the damaging effects of social media. Dern warned Jaya that beauty isn’t measured in followers or likes, but something much deeper. “The beauty of being a woman today is in savoring the minutiae of life, all the moments that add up to you,” she wrote. “The joy you’ll find in being in your body, in sexuality and sensuality, in service, in art, in mothering.”Dern’s biggest wish for her daughter is for her to write her own story and to be her “own delicious mess.” And she wrote to Jaya that along the way, she shouldn’t be afraid to fail. “You will succeed and fail in equal measure. Both experiences are worthwhile. They will both define you,” Dern wrote. “The truth is, the minute I surrendered to the flow of the mess of life, everything came together magnificently: my longing for art, my skill as an actor, and my capacities as a friend and mother.”Read Dern’s letter in full on InStyle."
56,ENTERTAINMENT,Game of Thrones: Tyrion Will Soon Betray Daenerys,"Gil Kidron, ContributorGot Academy, Co-Owner",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/game-of-thrones-tyrion-will-soon-betray-daenerys_us_5991df84e4b063e2ae0581b1,The chasm between them has never been more apparent.,2017-08-14,<p>A short term partnership. Tyrion and Daenerys</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5991e0061400002800ed0996.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The prophecy has foretold: Daenerys will suffer three betrayals. One for blood, one for gold and one for love.When Miri Maz Durr supposedly tried to revive Drogo, that was the blood betrayal. Jorah Mormont seems to be the betrayal for gold when he cut a deal with King Robert to have Daenerys killed in Season 1. So it remains to be seen who will be the third one to betray her, this time for love.The headline of this post kind of gave it away – it will be Tyrion.At first look, Daenerys and Tyrion met at the best moment possible for both of them, when they needed each other most. Daenerys has a need for Tyrion’s advice about Westerosi politics and politics in general, and Daenerys is the milk ticket that will allow Tyrion to take his talents to King’s Landing and do what he thinks he’s best at – being a good politician. Unlike the last time he was the Hand, now he has his queen’s ear and could steer her in a good direction, as far as possible from his nephew Joffrey and his sister Cersei.But this partnership does not look long for this world.The chasm between them has grown steadily and was never more apparent than in episode 5. In the previous episode Tyrion tried to dissuade his queen from using her dragon and Dothraki in open battle in Westeros, and then he was forced to watch in horror as she burned the entire Lannister army.Awesome as that battle scene was – more a “carnage scene” than a “battle scene” – it’s no coincidence that it unfolded almost entirely from the point of view of characters that are not named Daenerys. Through Tyrion’s eyes, we saw that he was rooting for his brother more than for his queen, even though Jaime is working for his queen’s main enemy, Cersei.And Tyrion’s walk on the battle field at the beginning of episode 5 spoke volumes: he looked forlorn passing through all those burned bodies.For a breakdown of Daenerys’ leadership style from a Machiavellian perspective watch this Game of Thrones Academy’s video.He was also clearly uneasy and frustrated with the way she dealt with the vanquished, offering them a choice between kneeling and death. When the two Tarlys chose to be killed rather than bend the knee for a foreign invader and her savage horde, he spoke against it and was overruled. She burned the father and son, a clear nod to her father’s actions, the Mad King, who burned the Stark father and son with Wildfire, an act that led the Starks and their allies to take up arms against the crown, and then topple House Targaryen.A Tyrion betrayal has been foreshadowed by the way other characters pledge their loyalty to Daenerys. Varys told her that he CHOOSES to support him, and she only asked him to promise to tip her off if he wants to stab her in the back, and Missandei echoed the sentiment by saying that her armies CHOOSE to follow her because they believe in her.Well, people can lose their belief in a politician and CHOOSE to support someone else.So, Daenerys’s journey of becoming a dragon heads in a straight collision course with Tyrion’s journey to repair the realm and dispense of politics as usual in Westeros, or break the wheel, as his queen calls it.Here lies the inherent difference between Daenerys and her Hand. She thinks she should rule because it’s her right, and therefore the end justifies the means. If she needs to unleash fire and fury like the world has never seen to get there, then so be it. Tyrion, on the other hand, thinks about the day after the war. He’s not a general but rather a politician, he understands the importance of making lasting alliances and how counter-productive it can be if you burn your bridges on the way to the throne. Basically, he yearns for the realm to finally get a worthy monarch who will “get it” the way he “gets it.”It seems inevitable that he will soon realize that she is not a new kind of politician, but rather more of the same. And maybe he will betray her for his love for his brother Jaime, or for his love for the realm. He will probably look for a contender whose outlook on the ruling seems more in line with his. The obvious candidate is Sansa Stark, Lady of Winter and future Queen of the United Kingdom.Check out Gil Kidron’s YouTube channel Game of Thrones Academy for a look at Game of Thrones through the lens of history.Follow Gil Kidron on Twitter: www.twitter.com/GoT_Academy"

Arpaio is scheduled to be sentenced on Oct. 5 and faces a maximum penalty of six months in jail and a fine, according to Reuters.Trump, who spoke with Fox News while on a “working vacation” at his club in Bedminster, New Jersey, said he could pardon Arpaio within days.“He has done a lot in the fight against illegal immigration,” Trump said. “He’s a great American patriot and I hate to see what has happened to him.”Arpaio gave himself the nickname “America’s toughest sheriff” while working in Maricopa County, where he operated a “tent city” jail and made inmates wear pink underwear and uniforms featuring stars and stripes.Arpaio was a leader in the birther movement that questioned former President Barack Obama’s birthplace, and therefore his legitimacy to serve as president. Arpaio led a years-long investigation into Obama’s birth certificate, which the then-president released in April 2011. Trump also spent years touting birther conspiracies.In 2013, a federal judge ordered Arpaio to stop using police tactics against Hispanic and Latino drivers, saying it amounted to racial profiling. Arpaio was holding what he called “saturation patrols” in an attempt to find people who had entered the country illegally.Arpaio publicly acknowledged he violated the judge’s order but argued the violations were “not intentional.”Amid this controversy, Arpaio lost his re-election bid to Democrat Paul Penzone. Arpaio had served as Maricopa County sheriff since 1993.The American Civil Liberties Union released a statement Monday saying an Arpaio pardon would be “an official presidential endorsement of racism.”“President Trump would be literally pardoning Joe Arpaio’s flagrant violation of federal court orders that prohibited the illegal detention of Latinos. He would undo a conviction secured by his own career attorneys at the Justice Department,” the organization said. “Make no mistake: This would be an official presidential endorsement of racism.”This article has been updated with comment from the ACLU.

Elizabeth Warren took the stage.The crowd was anxiety-ridden yet invigorating, two days before the GOP failed to get their votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act. I took the time to look around and reflect on the hundreds of people who had showed up after another hot work day. While I was empowered by my fellow protesters’ strength, one question ―the same that has run through my mind since the 2016 campaign ― nagged at me: Where are the men?This fall, I sat in my dorm room, enraged by the recently leaked tapes of Trump and Billy Bush bragging about ― let’s be blunt ― sexual assault, and wrote an article about the hypermasculinity of the Trump campaign and its connection to a college culture of sexual violence and toxic masculinity. I called in my male peers to step up and speak out against Trump and his hypermasculine behaviors. The article blew up on social media as I received notification after notification ― from women.Women thanked me for writing the article and for voicing what they were thinking. The few men and male-identified peers that shared and discussed the article were refreshing, for sure, but they were just that: few. In the months since Nov. 8, the “resistance” has given me opportunities to rally, march, phone bank, canvass and more. While each event brought revitalizing energy, I remained bothered by the gender ratio I observed. Time and again, women and trans folks were showing up, regardless of the cause ― abortion access, environmental justice, immigration rights. I could not say the same about my cisgender male peers.Unfortunately, my observations are not limited to my relatively small sphere in Central Maine. A Washington Post poll in February found that Democratic women are more likely than Democratic men to get involved in political activism. Lake Research Partners suggests a drastic difference: they found that women placed 86 percent of calls into senators’ offices. Jimmy Dahman, founder and Executive Director of the Town Hall Project, says that their email list has a 60:40 gender ratio ― with women comprising the majority.So why is it that women and gender minorities are pulling the weight of the resistance?An obvious answer, of course, is the Trump administration’s direct assault on women’s and trans rights. Emily Magner and Kaitlin Flynn, community organizers at Planned Parenthood Maine Action Fund, are well aware of the patterns within PPMAF. Flynn notes that “when you volunteer, you tend to gravitate toward the issue that is highest priority to you.” In the case of Planned Parenthood, the vast majority of volunteers are women, at least one in five of whom are served by Planned Parenthood’s services. The phenomenon of those most affected by injustice doing the most work to fight the injustice is widespread and troubling (to say the least).However, I think the cause for gender disparity is deeper than the issues at stake. Consider the socially-constructed expectations we hold around gender. Women are expected to be caring, emotion-driven and submissive. Meanwhile, masculinity carries the expectations of emotional stoicism, independence, dominance over women, physical toughness ― the list goes on. The very construction of masculinity, even within progressive populations, affects the low turnout and, all too often, apathy of men in the Resistance.Over the past three years, I’ve worked with academic Mark Tappan, EdD, at Colby College, along with other students, to research healthy masculinity, particularly what motivates social justice activism among men. In our conversations, men report a lack of feminist encouragement in the media, as well as overwhelming pressure from peers and people in power (e.g. parents, coaches, the president) to conform to masculine stereotypes. Many men care deeply about issues of gender equity and social justice, but social barriers like gender roles limit their participation.Even within their volunteer base, organizers Magner and Flynn saw a gender discrepancy: A higher proportion of men volunteer for data entry than they do to canvass or phone bank. The emotionally-intensive work of the Resistance ― phone calls, in person conversations, rallies ― is gendered, and it ultimately places a greater burden on women and gender minorities. Magner, who identifies as female, notes the toll the past nine months have placed on her and Flynn.“When you’re stretched this thin, you’re having to ask yourself what can I do so that I can get up tomorrow and do this work again,” she said. The emotional and physical toll of resistance is significant. (Heck, I’m frustrated and tired just writing this.)I may be naive ― though the energy I’ve given to this topic makes me think not ― but I believe we can change our conception of gender. As long as we’re talking about femininities and masculinities, can we imagine masculinities that value socially engaged citizens, that help us carry the weight of fighting sexism, transphobia, homophobia, etc.? I think so, but it will take work. To achieve gender equity within the movement that claims to be working for gender equity, we all need to be willing to interrogate our understanding of gender.Dahman, who worked on the Clinton campaign prior to founding Town Hall Project and has been a progressive activist since high school, notes that working for social justice as a male feminist requires extra consideration.“It’s understanding what you don’t know and taking stock of your position― the advantages I have of being a straight white male in politics,” he said. That extra work of acknowledging privilege is difficult, and it requires extra intentionality. The more that men like Dahman are willing to talk about their privilege, the easier it becomes for other allies to join them.The toll that the resistance is taking on women and trans folks is significant. I find myself exhausted keeping up with the news and rallies and action alerts, and I too often neglect my relationships and schoolwork. General anxiety levels are up thanks to the ideologies of the Trump administration (my own clinical anxiety included), and the positive energy generated by one victory can be quickly erased by yet another assault on a minority community.If we want to lessen that toll, we cannot take gender dynamics for granted. We need to reconsider the gender norms that encourage some to get involved and discourage others to sit back. We need to encourage masculinities that are about emotional ― not just physical ―­ strength, and that value women’s rights, not just women.Adrienne Carmack is a communications intern at Center for Community Change and rising senior at Colby College."

By Adam Kimelman.On Aug. 11 and Aug. 12, a group of white supremacists, neo-Nazis and members of the Ku Klux Klan gathered at the University of Virginia and Charlottesville for a “Unite the Right” rally. This farce of a rally turned violent, and acts of domestic terrorism have been responsible for taking the lives of three members of our community and injuring many others.As a student at UVA, I watched in horror as images and videos of torch-lit marches through the lawn and near the rotunda surfaced, with ralliers giving Nazi salutes and attacking my friends and classmates. The next day, the rally turned violent, and I was dismayed to see the videos of violent outbreaks and domestic terrorism as a car drove into a group of counter-protesters. Seeing national news stations reporting “live from Charlottesville” followed by such horrific footage was surreal.As a College Republican, I was horrified to see these vile beliefs attempting to use the conservative movement in order to legitimize their actions. Their hateful ideas are inconsistent and directly in opposition to many of the reasons that I, and many others, call ourselves Republicans. The entire Republican platform is built on the idea of equality of opportunity, and that the American Dream should be accessible to all who want to work for it no matter their race, religion or sexual orientation. The Republican Party was formed in opposition to slavery, and to this day it still holds those values true to its core. Our organization has been fighting these white supremacists from the last time they had a rally, and we will continue to fight them in the future.As I reflect back on the last few days, there are so many emotions I want to feel at the same time: anger at the white supremacists, sadness for those who have been injured and killed, admiration for those who counter-protested and the state police who prevented further violence, and fear for the safety of my many friends who were in Charlottesville.These hateful groups chose the conservative movement, our movement, in order to try to gain some form of legitimacy. By calling themselves the “alt-right,” they imply that they are still part of the larger conservative movement as a whole. Over history, this type of hatred has latched onto many different movements, sometimes calling themselves Republicans and sometimes Democrats. No matter how far their beliefs may be from the true values of the Republican Party, it is still our party they have chosen to latch onto, and it is our duty to reject it.While the vast majority of Republicans have been on the front line rejecting this hatred, including our Congressman Tom Garrett, Ed Gillespie and the entire statewide GOP ticket for Virginia, there are some who have been tepid in their response. President Trump could have and should have gone further in his condemnation. Others, like Corey Stewart, who instead try to condemn the “leftists” instead of the racists, are the reason that the “alt-right” has been able to grow.I have seen too many Facebook comments trying to rationalize the acts of the Nazis and white supremacists, some even blaming the police and the counter-protestors for the violence. The first step in fixing a problem is realizing that there is a problem, and for the Republican Party, the problem is that enough people have rationalized the “alt-right” that they still feel at home in our movement. Moving forward, we as Republicans need to do everything in our power to let these racists know that their beliefs are not our beliefs and that the alt-right is not welcome in our party in any form.With all the negativity that the national press has associated with the events in Charlottesville, it is important to realize that this city is an amazing place and that these events are by no means representative of the town. Law enforcement estimated that over 90 percent of those at this rally came from not only from outside of this city but outside of Virginia as a whole. They brought their hate-filled beliefs to Virginia, but do not represent those ideas that Virginians hold true.The actual Virginians who were present as the events unfolded represent the true Charlottesville. The Virginia State Police, including Lt. Cullen and Trooper Bates, both of whom gave their lives attempting to protect others, represent the true Charlottesville. The reporters who risked their well being to record the events, including members of the student-run Cavalier Daily (some of whom were pepper sprayed during the events), represent the true Charlottesville. The doctors, nurses, and medical volunteers, who helped to treat those who were injured, represent the true Charlottesville. And the members of our community, including Heather Heyer, who attempted to counter this hate by letting these white supremacists know that they would not be welcome here, represent the true Charlottesville.It was in Charlottesville that UVA’s founder, Thomas Jefferson, first wrote the words, “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.” As UVA students arriving on grounds next week, some for the first time, we must do everything we can to unify and heal as a university and a city. Beliefs like those espoused on the 11th and 12th have attempted to drive fear into our hearts before, and we have defeated them. I have full confidence that the UVA and Charlottesville Community will speak as one in rejecting these beliefs and defeating them again.This piece was published originally by College Reaction on Collegereaction.com.Inquiries can be directed to news@collegereaction.com."

One of the measures undertaken to mitigate this serious threat deserves much more attention than it has gained so far. I’m referring to the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), an American anti-missile defense system which the U.S. positioned this year in South Korea.There are differences of opinions among experts how effective these systems are. Jeffrey Lewis, an arms control analyst at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, notes that THAAD can defend against short- and medium-range missiles, but would not against ICBM. Anyhow, so far South Korea allowed only the positioning of one battery that has a limited effect. However, even if these anti-missile batteries are much less valuable than advocates claim, we need to pay more mind to the high costs they exact. They are very destabilizing — because there is reason to hold that THAAD surveillance could be marshaled in the tracking, identification, and destruction of not just North Korean but also Chinese missiles.Those quick to exclaim “Great, two for the price of one” should recall that nuclear powers hold each other at bay; that mutually assured destruction seems to be a major reason the big powers have avoided war since 1945. To remind: The logic of nuclear deterrence presumes that if either China or the U.S. launches a nuclear attack, they must expect to be paid back in kind, to be devastated, and therefore any major strike is virtually suicidal. However, if one nuclear power can prevent a retaliatory strike (by an anti-missile defense system, for instance), the other nation must fear the possibility of a devastating attack without the ability to respond. As a result, the mutual destruction is no longer assured, and the deterrence effect breaks down. Further, such concerns may well lead the newly vulnerable nation to put its nuclear forces on a hair trigger alert, ready to strike preemptively at any sign of preparation of an attack by the other. In short, if THAAD batteries are effective, they are highly destabilizing.American officials claim that THAAD serves to protect against a North Korean, not a Chinese, attack. According to a joint statement issued by American and South Korean officials in 2016, the anti-missile system would “ensure the security of the South and its people, and [protect] alliance military forces from North Korea’s weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile threats.” And, most importantly, the system is “focused solely on North Korean nuclear and missile threats and would not be directed towards any third party nations.” American officials sought to ease China’s anxiety by offering a briefing on the technical details of THAAD. As then U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, “We realize China may not believe us and also proposed to go through the technology and specifications with them…and prepared to explain what the technology does and what it doesn’t do and hopefully they will take us up on that proposal.” Defense Secretary James Mattis told reporters in South Korea simply, “There is no other nation that needs to be concerned about THAAD other than North Korea if they’re engaged in something that’s offensive.”The Chinese are far from convinced. According to state news media, President Xi has said that THAAD will not solve the North Korea problem, and accused the U.S. of “using responding to a threat as a pretext to unilaterally deploy missile defense systems in Europe and Asia, causing serious harm to the strategic security interests of countries in the region.” Li Bin, an academic with expertise in arms control, explains that Chinese officials are worried THAAD’s radar system “would undermine China’s nuclear deterrence by collecting important data on Chinese nuclear warheads that the United States could not acquire from other sources.”With a relatively small nuclear arsenal, China is worried that surveillance of this kind would undermine its ability to strike back if attacked by the U.S.Some American experts pooh-pooh China’s concerns, claiming that it has overstated THAAD’s capabilities in order to use the issue to weaken the U.S.-South Korea military alliance and solidify its own regional dominance. Robert Kelly, a professor of international relations, commented, “Beijing’s objections are shallow enough for the real message to come through: that South Korea should not further its military relationship with the United States.” Others, however, see Chinese grievances as legitimate, especially with respect to its strategic interests. Jaganath Sankaran of the Center for International and Security Studies at Maryland along with Bryan L. Fearey, director of the National Security Office at Los Alamos National Laboratories, write that China fears encirclement and that even initially mild defense postures like THAAD could accumulate growing capabilities over time and thus be converted into larger and more threatening postures.Addressing China’s claim that THAAD may be used against their missiles, Greg Thielmann, former State Department intelligence analyst and board member of the Arms Control Association, argued that Beijing has legitimate concerns about the impact of the THAAD radar on China’s nuclear deterrent. Although this radar’s present configuration is oriented toward defense against North Korean missiles, it would only take hours to convert the system software into a configuration that would improve the effectiveness of U.S. strategic defenses based in Alaska and California against Chinese ICBMs by providing earlier tracking data on their launches toward the United States.Theodore Postol, professor emeritus at MIT, notes: “[Deploying THAAD] puts South Korea at odds with China over a defense system that has no merit for South Korea’s defense, and it will certainly raise tensions between China and Japan.” Postol adds that an indirect and far-ranging consequence of THAAD could be the downgrade of American credibility, as deployment affirms “the view of many nations that deal with the U.S. that the U.S. is untrustworthy in terms of its commitments.”Whether THAAD batteries are truly effective or their prowess much more limited than advertised, whether they are designed to work only against North Korean missiles but ignore Chinese ones, or whether the Chinese have reasons to be concerned—there is no doubt that they are highly destabilizing. The Chinese cannot simply accept that these anti-missile batteries will not hamper their ability to retaliate, especially given the U.S.’ continued refusal even to state that it will not strike first.The U.S. cannot simply remove the THAAD system, because of the very serious North Korean threat to U.S. forces in the region, to South Korea and Japan, and soon to the U.S. mainland. These batteries do seem to be able to mitigate such a threat to some extent. However, their destabilizing side effects strongly compel the U.S. to intensify the quest for more effective and compensative ways to deal with the North Korean nuclear threat. As I suggested here, such a drive best entails a major deal with China—in which the removal of THAAD can serve as one bargaining chip. The bargain entails a commitment from the U.S. that if China helps defang the North Korea threat—the U.S. will have no reason to keep THAAD in South Korea.This article was previously published in The Diplomat.Amitai Etzioni is a University Professor and professor of international relations at The George Washington University.

She raps in her dreams. While brushing her teeth. Changing her grandmother’s diaper. Into the loudspeaker at a convenience store. At her catering job. Inside abandoned shacks in parks. She jots lyrics in journals and freestyles in parking lots. She drives a burnt-red station wagon with a license plate that reads “PATTIWGN.” She fantasizes about a glistening hip-hop career, far away from the monotony of her lower-class New Jersey upbringing. Patricia Dumbrowski is also 23, plus-size and white, with thick, curly blond hair that falls below her shoulders. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Killa P to the stage. You’ve never seen a rapper like this. Really, Patricia Dumbrowski is Danielle Macdonald, a fledgling Australian actress who’d never rapped ― she can’t even sing ― before Geremy Jasper chose her for the lead role in his new movie, “Patti Cake$.” Jasper saw a photograph of Macdonald and knew right away that she was his star. As for the whole rapping thing? “I was like, ‘I can’t say yes to this,’” Macdonald, 26, recalled during an interview last month at HuffPost’s New York offices. “I don’t know why this guy thinks I can rap, but I cannot.” Oh, whatever ― they’d figure that out later, Jasper said. And they did. “Patti Cake$,” which opens in theaters Friday, became one of this year’s Sundance Film Festival crowd-pleasers. The movie rests on Macdonald’s shoulders, and she was christened an instant luminary. It’s a rags-dreaming-of-riches story: Patti and her BFF (newcomer Siddharth Dhananjay) stare at the Manhattan skyline across the Hudson River, longing to parlay their rhymes into a record deal.Macdonald, who moved to Los Angeles at 18 and earned her Screen Actors Guild credentials via an episode of “Glee,” has appeared in the low-budget thriller “The East” and a couple of indies that were barely released theatrically (“Trust Me,” “Every Secret Thing”). In 2014, Jasper called to ask her to attend the Sundance screenwriting lab in Utah, where nascent filmmakers spend a few weeks workshopping their projects with the help of Hollywood professionals. (“Reservoir Dogs,” “Boys Don’t Cry,” “Requiem for a Dream” and “Fruitvale Station” are among the many movies that went through the lab.) There, Macdonald and Jasper perfected the character of Patti ― her cramped home life, the disenchantment hidden beneath her confident facade. Assuming “Patti Cake$” would never get studio financing with an unknown like her as the lead, Macdonald treated the adventure like a “terrifying” acting exercise. Surely someone else would get cast by the time the movie was greenlit, she thought ― probably someone who could rap.Fast-forward three years, and it’s hard to imagine anyone but Macdonald in the role. Onscreen, she carries herself with the command of a veteran star, well aware of the winking humor inherent in a doughy white girl who can out-perform the best of them. Patti lives in a modest Jersey house with her wheelchair-reliant, chain-smoking grandma (Cathy Moriarty) and an oft-drunk mother (Bridget Everett) who would rather people think of Patti as her sister who helps with their mounting bills.Macdonald learned to rap by studying PTAF’s “Boss Ass Bitch” and Nicki Minaj’s catalog, particularly “Truffle Butter,” breaking down the songs line by line. (She could never master Kendrick Lamar’s “Control” verse, though. “He does not breathe, I swear,” Macdonald said, laughing.) She’d mark up the lyrics, indicating where to take a breath or pause, until she didn’t need the coding system anymore and was ready to lay down Patti’s original tracks. In came a dialect coach to help with the Jersey intonations and a rap coach to help her “sit in the beat and be more comfortable.” The final results earned Macdonald a standing ovation at the movie’s Sundance premiere. Now, she’s headed for the big leagues. She appeared in the finale of “American Horror Story: Roanoke” ― the experience matched the frenzy of every Ryan Murphy production; Macdonald got the job 15 hours before the shoot started ― and has a supporting part in the Greta Gerwig–directed comedy “Lady Bird,” opening in November. She’ll soon put her amateurish musical appetite to further use in “Dumplin’,” playing a Texas-based Dolly Parton obsessive who enlists in a pageant to piss off her beauty-queen mother (Jennifer Aniston). Macdonald also scored the headlining role in the forthcoming adaptation of the novel White Girl Problems. And she’ll always have ""rapper"" on her résumé.“If you make one person happy, there you go ― you did your job,” she said, reflecting on the attention “Patti Cake$” has already received before hitting theaters. “With this movie, it was very weird because on set it felt very special always. Very magical. But at the same time, you’re like, ‘No one will see this, but this feels special.’ When Sundance happened, it felt insane and not like reality at all. I was in this bubble with these same people. Now I’m just taking it one day at a time.”“Patti Cake$” opens in select theaters Aug. 18."

The weekend will consist of workshops and speaking forums to teach attendees how to take the Jan. 21 protest and turn it into a movement. The convention will tap into “the power of women in leadership as the fundamental, grassroots force for change,” the website reads, adding that “participants will leave inspired and motivated, with new connections, skills and strategies for working towards collective liberation for women of all races, ethnicities, ages, abilities, sexual identities, gender expressions, immigration statuses, religious faiths, and economic statuses.” Bob Bland, co-organizer of the Women’s March, told HuffPost that the convention will be open to anyone who would like to attend, not just people who identify as women. “The Women’s Convention is literally a one-stop shop for any organizer or any leader or anyone who has aspirations to lead in their communities to come and learn from all of our different partners,” Bland told HuffPost.The attendance fee will be $295 per person ― an amount that the Women’s March deemed “necessary to help us cover the expense of holding a conference.” Bland was quick to point out that the organization is hard at work raising money to sponsor women who can’t pay their own way. “In order to effectively harness the power of women from all backgrounds, the Women’s Convention must be accessible to women and allies regardless of economic barriers,” the website reads. (Head here to sponsor an attendee or donate.) Bland said that the main goal for The Women’s Convention is for activists and organizers to leave with more skills and more contacts so that they can bring the movement back to their hometowns. “How do we bring all of these intersectional issues and all of these people together and then truly build lasting power and transformational change over time?” Bland said. “It can’t just be about mass mobilization, it can’t just be about rapid action.”That’s where the workshops will come in. Although the details of sessions have not yet been publicized, Bland said there will be workshops for everyone from first-time activists to seasoned organizers. “We want everyone to be able to come together and connect, even on issues that they’re not necessarily comfortable with and to have discussions about that and learn how to have more of those discussions within your communities,” Bland said.She added that this piece of the puzzle will be especially important following the recent violent protests that erupted in Charlottesville, Virginia over the weekend ― particularly for white women.“A lot of us are just waking up to how horrible it is for the rest of the country, and that it really is unbearable for us to continue benefitting from a system that oppresses everybody else,” Bland said. “We can’t let this happen and we can’t continue. We need to build an America that we can be proud of. And I know with women in leadership we can do that.”In order to continue the movement, Bland said that women must set the agenda going forward in the U.S. “We’ve had such a stark reality check of what a Trump presidency has brought us to at this point. It goes so far beyond politics,” she said. “It’s about what America stands for: Does it stand for hate and fear and bigotry or does it stand for love and diversity and inclusion and tolerance? That’s something that women need to band together again on ― the way we did on Jan. 21 ― and then craft a policy agenda and continue building not just in the streets but also building political power in the halls of Congress and in our local communities.”Head to The Women’s Convention website to learn more.

Roosevelt signed Social Security into law. The program has most emphatically",2017-08-14,<p>President Franklin D. Roosevelt signs Social Security into law.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/598f6f6215000024008b64ad.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Eighty-two years ago, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Social Security into law. The program has most emphatically stood the test of time. Today, our nation’s Social Security system provides nearly every American with old age, life, and disability insurance. These critical protections allow middle and working class people to retire with freedom and dignity, and provide vital support for people facing disability or the death of a breadwinner.Social Security has never been more essential than it is today. Traditional defined benefit pensions are increasingly rare, especially for younger Americans. That means that for future generations of retirees, Social Security will be the only guaranteed retirement income that they can never outlive. Already, one-third of elderly beneficiaries rely on Social Security for all or nearly all of their income. That number will be higher for their children and grandchildren.The problem with relying solely on Social Security? Benefits are too low to allow America’s families to retire and face disability or the death of a breadwinner without drastic cuts in their standards of living. Social Security benefits are modest by virtually any measure. Average benefits are only $16,000 a year. Though the Social Security benefits are too low, they are still a major improvement over the time before Social Security. Prior to its enactment, people, as they aged, had no resources at all and were forced to move in with adult children or condemned to live in squalid poorhouses. Surviving parents often had no choice but to give up their children when spouses died prematurely; working families were left destitute when workers became disabled or died. Americans deserved better, and the country responded. It is time to respond further. Though Social Security has provided us with greater economic security, it can do more. When FDR signed the Social Security Act of 1935, he referred to the new law as “a cornerstone in a structure which is being built but is by no means complete.” Past generations have heeded that call — including by adding survivor and disability benefits to Social Security and by instituting cost of living increases so that benefits don’t erode over time. Now it’s our generation’s turn. It should be a no-brainer for us to expand Social Security benefits, making them more generous so that no one has to retire into poverty or face destitution as the result of disability or the death of a loved one.But sadly, too many politicians want to move in the opposite direction by cutting Social Security’s modest benefits. In the last few years, the split along partisan lines has become increasingly clear. Democrats have united around expanding, not cutting, Social Security. Republicans continue to support cuts, though they never admit to it. Instead, they say that we need to cut Social Security to “save” it, because we “can’t afford” its modest benefits. That is utterly false. We are the wealthiest country in the history of the world. Cutting or expanding Social Security is entirely a question of values, not affordability. Republican politicians might not like the idea of their millionaire and billionaire campaign donors paying into the program at the same rate as everyone else, but voters of all political affiliations believe that is fair. During last year’s presidential primary, opposition to Social Security cuts was the only issue that united Ted Cruz supporters, Bernie Sanders supporters, and everyone in between.Donald Trump recognized this opening, and broke from the rest of his Party by running on a promise not to cut Social Security. But this pledge was never very believable for those who looked beneath his campaign rhetoric, given his long past history of support for cutting and privatizing Social Security. Sure enough, after only a few months in office, Trump broke his promise by releasing a budget proposal that included cuts to Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI.) Despite his administration’s cynical attempts to divide and conquer by claiming that SSDI isn’t “core” Social Security, the American people won’t be fooled. Social Security is one intertwined program. A threat to any part of it is a threat to all of it.Republicans in Congress and the White House have also been attacking Social Security through a sneaky backdoor route. Historically, the Social Security Administration (SSA) has been well known for efficient, quality service. But since the GOP took control of the House in 2010, they’ve been slashing the agency’s budget — despite the fact that the American people pay for SSA services with their Social Security contributions. As a result, SSA has been forced to shutter field offices, lay off staff, and reduce hours at remaining offices. Wait times at the offices and the agency’s 1-800 number have increased, and the backlog for disability benefits keeps growing. This cruel and unnecessary starvation of SSA has made it more difficult for Americans, especially those in rural areas, to access their earned benefits.On Social Security’s 82nd birthday, the program is at a crossroads. It is extremely successful and more important than ever, but it is also under threat from politicians who reject the idea that government can be a force for good in people’s lives. In next year’s midterm elections, the American people will face a choice, one that will have a major impact on Social Security’s future.If Republicans remain in power, and especially if they gain more seats in the Senate, they will feel emboldened to continue chipping away at Social Security, eroding the system through a thousand tiny cuts. But if Democrats are smart and run boldly and clearly on a strong platform of expanding Social Security benefits and adequately funding the Social Security Administration, they can show the American people that they stand with us. Winning on a platform of expanding Social Security would send a clear message to Washington: Hands off Social Security — except to make it better. Join us in telling Congress to expand, not cut, Social Security’s modest benefits."

President Donald Trump personally addressed the day’s violence but refused to criticize the white supremacist groups. Instead, he blamed the “hatred, bigotry and violence” that he said was seen on “many sides” and urged everyone to come together.Neo-Nazi website Daily Stormer later praised Trump’s response, declaring: “He loves us all.”"

Racists no longer feel confined to trolling people on Twitter and are suddenly removing their white hoods and boldly showing their faces at KKK rallies.This puts businesses in a precarious situation: if you discover, online or otherwise, that one of your employees is racist — and actively engaged in promoting white supremacy — what should you do?Google recently fired James Damore shortly after he spent his working hours producing a 10 page anti-diversity manifesto in which he speculated that his women colleagues were biologically inferior to men. After the manifesto went viral, Google’s head of diversity Danielle Brown issued a statement acknowledging the manifesto, disputing its accuracy, and reaffirming Google’s commitment to diversity. Google CEO Sundar Pichai went out of his way to remind young girls in tech, “You belong in this industry. We need you.” And lastly, Damore was the unfortunate recipient of the dreaded pink slip, namely for violating Google’s code of conduct.Google did the right thing by sending a powerful message about their unwavering commitment to diversity and rejecting harmful gender stereotypes. Research shows time and time again that diversity isn’t just a nice-to-have, but a strategic imperative. Research by McKinsey tells us that 35 percent of ethnically diverse companies outperform their competitors, and diversity in the boardroom generates better and more profitable ideas. Still, there might be some white supremacists among our workplaces.If you’ve hired a racist, what should you do?Acknowledge that you’ve hired a racist. It can be very powerful to email your workforce acknowledging that, somewhere in the hiring process, you miscalculated a person’s cultural fit for your business. If one of your employees marched alongside the KKK in Charlottesville, let your workforce know. They probably already know, and your silence would simply ring volumes. In fact, Twitter user @YesYoureRacist identified several of the speakers and protestors at Charlotteville’s white nationalist rally.Social media is a powerful community-building tool, but it also can be useful in exposing people. Sometimes, those people just so happen to be our students or employees who espouse Nazism. The values they harbor have no place in society, let alone our payroll.Cristina Lara managed diversity and inclusion at Hillary for America.

Look at the intentional courting ... on the one hand, of all of these white supremacists, white nationalist groups,” Signer said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union” as he discussed the deadly violence that afflicted his city on Saturday sparked by a “Unite the Right” rally.“And then look on the other hand at the repeated failure to step up and condemn, denounce, silence, put to bed, all of those different efforts just like we saw yesterday. This is not hard,” he said.“There are two words that need to be said over and over again ― domestic terrorism and white supremacy,” he said.Speaking on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Signer said the views of these “anti-Semites, racists, Aryans, Nazis,” and KKK members previously had been kept “in the shadows.”Now, he continued, “they’ve been given a key and a reason to come into the light.”“There’s an old saying, when you dance with the devil, the devil changes you,” Signer said, referring to the messaging that marked Trump’s presidential bid. “I think he made a choice in that campaign, a very regrettable one, to really go to people’s prejudices, to go to the gutter.”He added: “People are dying and I do think it is now on the president and on all of us to say, enough is enough. This movement has run its course.”Three people died Saturday in Charlottesville ― a 32-year-old woman was killed when a car plowed into a crowd of counter-protesters, and two Virginia state troopers on duty perished when their helicopter crashed on the city’s outskirts.Trump, in responding to Saturday’s violence, refused to criticize the white supremacist groups who had organized the rally. Instead, he blamed the “hatred, bigotry and violence” that he said was seen on “many sides.”The suspect in the car attack, James Alex Fields Jr., 20, had been photographed earlier in the day holding a white supremacist emblem with the fascist group, Vanguard America. One of Fields’ former high school teachers has described him as “infatuated with Nazis” and Adolf Hitler.Vanguard, in a statement posted to Twitter, said Fields is not one of their members and that shields, featuring their emblem, were handed out to anyone attending the rally.Trump’s presidential campaign had been endorsed by a number of white supremacists, including former KKK leader David Duke, who attended the Charlottesville rally.In an interview with The Indianapolis Star on Saturday, Duke said the gathering of white supremacists represented “a turning point for the people of this country.”“We are determined to take our country back. We are going to fulfill the promises of Donald Trump. That’s what we believed in, that’s why we voted for Donald Trump. Because he said he’s going to take our country back. That’s what we gotta do,” he told the Star.Duke on Saturday later took to twitter to respond to a tweet by Trump that encouraged everyone to “condemn all that hate stands for.”“I would recommend you take a good look in the mirror & remember it was White Americans who put you in the presidency, not radical leftists,” he responded."

For this I felt persuaded to apologize by way of introduction. It must feel suffocating to sit on the other side of such vultures. Pattinson pled ignorance. “I just came in and they weren’t there,” he said, playfully defiant. “I’m almost certain it’s not about me, though.”Who else would they be looking for? “I go in and out, and I’m like, ’They’re not following! It’s clearly someone else,’” he said, almost proud at the realization that maybe there’s somebody more sought-after in the building. Doubtful. If anything, his comment proved that he’s all too familiar with the dance that occurs between shutterbug and famous subject. After all, this is the man who, according to a GQ profile published last week, rode around in the trunks of cars and parked rental vehicles throughout Los Angeles in case he needed to make a quick getaway. He’s depressingly well-trained in the art of paparazzi circumvention. It made sense that Pattinson was semi-incognito when I met him in a discreet corner of the hotel’s bar. Dressed in a chunky gray sweatshirt, jeans and a ratty black baseball cap that covered his forehead and concealed his signature mane, Pattinson was calm about the pap situation but exhausted from the many interviews he’s given in recent weeks to promote “Good Time,” his new movie. “I’m terrible right now,” he said, laughing. “Good Time” is a film that begs discussion, because of its contents and because it confirms that post-“Twilight” Pattinson will not be pigeonholed into any sort of Hollywood box. By nature, it feels weird to declare one’s love for “Good Time,” a grubby indie drama in which Pattinson plays Connie, a mostly irredeemable goon flitting through Queens, trying to evade the police after robbing a bank with his deaf, mentally challenged younger brother, Nick (Benny Safdie, who co-directed the movie with his brother, Joshua). Connie calls the shots, but Nick is the one who lands in jail, sending Connie on a goose chase to secure $10,000 to bail him out. At once unnerved and expressionless, this is the fiercest performance of Pattinson’s career, which has taken him from “Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,” “Water for Elephants” and four of those uber-famous vampire flicks to the comparatively obscure art-house scene. Since the “Twilight” series ended in 2012, Pattinson has solidified his range via two movies directed by sci-fi weirdo David Cronenberg (“Cosmopolis” and “Maps to the Stars”), a dystopian revenge drama (“The Rover”) and a few arty biopics that not many people saw, including this year’s excellent “Lost City of Z.”If popularity is the metric, Pattinson’s IMDb page makes it look like he hasn’t done much over the past five years. It’s not because he isn’t in demand: Pattinson said he reads about eight scripts each week ― that’s more than 400 per year.He can’t define his taste, not even to his agents: “I’m only looking for things that surprise me, really.” He’s instructed his reps to pass along scripts that feature character descriptions along the lines of “tall, 31, pedophile, gross.” It’s a joke, of course, the point being that Rob Pattinson has no interest in conventional roles. He wants to play the last person you think he’d play.That’s “harder” today, he confirmed, than it was in 2008, when the inaugural “Twilight” movie opened. Back then, Hollywood was only just beginning its franchise takeover, where familiar properties with ballooning budgets ― reboots, spinoffs, interminable sequels, single books split into two or more movies ― eroded a lot of the space occupied by fresh stories. In fact, “Good Time” came about because Pattinson saw an image from the Safdie brothers’ previous film, the heroin-junkie romance “Heaven Knows What,” and reached out to say he liked their style. Thankfully, he’s had the paychecks to bankroll his interest in independent projects. Pattinson and co-stars Kristen Stewart and Taylor Lautner reportedly earned $25 million apiece, along with 7.5 percent of the massive theatrical grosses, for the two-part “Breaking Dawn.” But Pattinson had no idea in 2008 that “Twilight” would help to define Hollywood’s new bigger-is-better economic model. “I remember when ‘Twilight’ first came out, it was the first time I’d really heard film series be referred to as ‘franchises,‘” Pattinson said. “And then you see everyone talking about the word ‘franchise’ as if it’s this revered term. ‘Franchise’ should not be about a movie. That’s a fast-food restaurant. Everyone was like ‘the franchise, the franchise’ the whole time. I just thought, ‘Shut up!’ It’s rote. All these actors are saying ‘franchise’ ― it’s like, what are you doing? You’ve drunk the Kool-Aid!” Pattinson may be franchise-free now, but that could change, if Lionsgate gets its way. An executive from the studio, which distributed the “Twilight” films, recently said “there are a lot more stories to be told” in the series, assuming author Stephenie Meyer is keen. This was news to Pattinson.“Really?” he asked. He then thrust his hands into the air and yelped in faux-enthusiasm: “Yes!” So, that’s a “no thanks,” right?“Well, you never know,” he said, backtracking. ”It did inspire me at the time. And, really, it’s kind of awesome. It’s the way people interpret it. People would excuse you for not taking something seriously if it becomes this mainstream thing and everyone’s fiending. I took it just as seriously — more seriously — than other things I’ve done.”Having developed a sort of paparazzi PTSD from the whole experience, you’d think Pattinson would dismiss any “Twilight” talk out of hand. Instead, he grasps the cultural role it plays, and he clearly respects the fan base ― largely teen girls ― who bought $3.3 billion in tickets worldwide. If nothing else, he understands his reputation is forever linked to that of Edward Cullen, and there’s no point in condemning that.“It’s also like, you fucking did it,” he said. “It’s you! At the end of the day, the behind-the-scenes shit doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter.”Because Pattinson backed away from movies that carry the potential to top the box office, he was surprised to learn that talk shows would still book him to promote “Good Time.” Was anyone still interested, he wondered.“I do sort of live in my own world a lot of the time,” he said. “I’m pretty ignorant. It’s funny ― I’ve basically, as far as I can tell, been really under the radar for years. I’m kind of surprised at it all. [...] I thought I had really reached a hyper-saturation point.

I still don’t really have anything to say.”Except he does. “Good Time” was his most immersive filmmaking experience to date. A London native, Pattinson embedded himself in Queens, mastering the New York borough’s native accent, losing weight so Connie would look slightly malnourished, and living in a low-rent basement apartment. The story takes place over the course of a single night, including dashes through the streets in unchoreographed shots that let Pattinson interact with his surroundings organically. In terms of bystanders, he went largely unnoticed. At last, invisibility was his. Indeed, Pattinson, like his co-star and ex-girlfriend Stewart, has made peace with his fame.

I can take responsibility for stuff I say about myself, but it’s the same way I don’t like people talking about me.”Pattinson laughed as he said that last sentence, at which point his publicist announced that our allotted interview time had ended. I shook his hand and strolled out of the Bowery Hotel. It had been less than half an hour since I arrived, and the paparazzi lineup had doubled in size.

Then, they stomped down to Emancipation Park with the affectation of Marines and the discipline of kindergarteners.Hundreds of anti-racism activists marched in counter-protest, as they have done before. The difference in their strengths showed just how much of a fringe group the white nationalists were, albeit an obnoxiously loud one.In a particularly moving video, Charlottesville’s clergy stood arm-in-arm and preached love as self-appointed peacekeepers sporting camouflage with confederate markings looked on impotently, their assault rifles pointed earthward. Violence broke out, and innocents were injured ― and one killed ― in cold blood by a crazed driver.The president decried violence on “many sides.” I’m afraid I counted only one.“You will not replace us.”That slogan made me reflect upon what the violence of today had replaced.My first visit to Emancipation Park, while it was still Lee Park, was in 2011 to find homeless residents of Charlottesville in need of health screenings. My fellow medical students and I chatted with them about their lives, told them about what we had to offer in the church right across the street, and escorted them inside. Within the church, medical students of multiple ethnicities—Korean, Chinese, Caucasian, Jewish, African-American, Indian ― worked as a team to check blood pressures, blood sugars, and find ways to connect them to the health care that they needed. The church bustled with activity and I swelled with pride as I watched my fellow volunteers pour their hearts and brains into the welfare of their fellow human beings.The downtown mall, which became the scene of animalistic carnage today, was another hot recruiting spot for us. We walked around with placards announcing our health fair. The adorable children of one of our professors added to the vibrancy of our health fair. Passersby of all colors and convictions talked to us and several took us up on our offer of free health checks. We felt grateful to be in a community where churches, medical centers, students, and physicians eagerly came together for the sake of service. The only identity that mattered that day: human. The sun smiled down as we held up our handmade posters, but we basked in the warmth of our community.So I am sorry if David Duke and his ilk believe that such activity was a liberal conspiracy to get rid of them. They’re just plain wrong. Charlottesville has previously set a new standard for dealing with hateful protests by creating opportunities for the community to reflect upon racism as well as mutual respect and inclusion. And by consistently showing up in force to protest against hatred, the people of Charlottesville have ensured that the wannabe nazis cannot claim the mantle of the silent majority. Knowing what I do of the Charlottesville community, today’s cowardly acts of violent inhumanity will not change the love and the willingness to love that define this town.To the white nationalists, I say: “YOU will not replace US.”"
73,POLITICS,My Exchange With Alt-Right Leader Richard Spencer,"Geoffrey R. Stone, ContributorEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, The Uni...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/my-exchange-with-alt-right-leader-richard-spencer_us_598fc798e4b0caa1687a60d5,I recently received an email from Spencer in response to an op-ed I wrote in April.,2017-08-13,"White nationalist Richard Spencer and his supporters clash with Virginia State Police in Lee Park after the 'Unite the Right' rally was declared an unlawful gathering August 12, 2017 in Charlottesville, Virginia. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59905e34140000421aed06ea.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Richard Spencer is one of the leading voices of the alt-right movement in the United States. He was scheduled to be one of the main speakers at Saturday’s event in Charlottesville. Spencer forcefully advocates a set of white supremacist views about race and religion that I find personally abhorrent. Nonetheless, back in April I wrote an op-ed in the New York Times defending Spencer’s First Amendment right to speak at Auburn University, drawing an analogy to the right of the American Nazi Party to march in Skokie, Illinois, in 1978.On August 1, I received an email from Spencer, which led to the following exchange:Dear Professor Stone, My response:Dear Mr. Spencer, But what are the views of the alt-right that Spencer advances? Shortly after the election of Donald Trump, John Woodrow Cox wrote an excellent piece in the Washington Post describing those views, after spending some time with Spencer. “For years,” Cox wrote, “Spencer and his followers worked in obscure corners of the Internet to promote pride in white identity and the creation of an ‘ethno-state’ that would banish minorities.” Cox added that “no one is more critical to the alt-right movement than Spencer,” who “envisions a world in which his ideals are embraced by the mainstream” and who “has vowed to keep pushing until that happens.”At the end of an alt-right dinner which Cox attended shortly after Trump’s election, Spencer closed the proceedings by declaring “‘Let’s party like it’s 1933,’ referencing the year Hitler was appointed Germany’s chancellor and the Nazis embarked on the creation of their own ethno-state. Beneath chandeliers and amid dark, wood-paneled walls, the alt-right erupted in cheers. Spencer, his expression now serious, waited for them to quiet, then spoke once more. ‘Let’s party like it’s 2016!’ he shouted, raising his bare arms and pumping them in the air as the room roared even louder.”At the very core of the alt-right’s goal is “an all-white country.” Echoing Rev. Martin Luther King, Spencer declared: “I have a dream.” When asked how that dream could be achieved in a nation with more than 100 million blacks, Asians, and Latinos, he replied: “Look, maybe it will be horribly bloody and terrible. That’s a possibility with everything.”At the end of the event that Cox attended, Spencer “referred to the media as the lügenpresse, a Nazi-era term meaning ‘lying press.’” He then proclaimed that: “We willed Donald Trump into office. We made this dream our reality. For us, it is conquer or die. For us, as Europeans, it is only normal again when we are great again? Hail Trump! Hail our people! Hail victory!”No, I think I personally won’t invite Spencer to speak on campus. And I hope others will have the good sense to recognize ugly, ignorant, vile, hatred when they see it. But if our students or faculty want to hear what he has to say, I will vehemently defend their right to do so. And then I will make clear to anyone who cares to listen why I disagree with him."

In statements and tweets, Trump condemned hate, bigotry and violence but said that it was coming from “many sides.”"

These counter-events are being held in response to the violence that broke out at Saturday’s so-called “Unite The Right” rally, which was attended by thousands of white supremacists, armed militia groups and Ku Klux Klan members, as well as anti-racist counter-protesters.Helen Kalla, press manager for Indivisible, told HuffPost that there are 6,000 local groups in their network, adding that Indivisible’s mission is to resist President Donald Trump’s “agenda by empowering local groups to hold their members of Congress accountable.”Events in response to Saturday’s violence erupted in New York, Seattle, Chicago, Baltimore and other major cities Saturday night through Sunday. More were scheduled to take place in San Francisco and other cities Sunday night. The impromptu rallies are a call to “stand in solidarity with Charlottesville,” according to Indivisible. They range from candlelight vigils, rallies celebrating diversity and sit-in demonstrations to marches against racism and “vigils against fascist violence.”In Charlottesville on Sunday afternoon, people held a moment of silence as they formed a circle around the spot where Heather Heyer, a 32-year-old counter-protester, died after a man attending the rally drove his car into an anti-racist group.Another vigil planned by Heyer’s family on the University of Virginia campus was canceled amid fear of clashes and violence. Would-be attendees were turned away, and some said they were devastated to learn that Saturday’s rally had bred so much fear. Gatherings elsewhere are an opportunity for Americans to stand with those confronting racism in Charlottesville, the Indivisible Project said.“This weekend, hate groups and domestic terrorists of all stripes went to Charlottesville, VA to push their hateful message of white supremacy, fascism, anti-Semitism, and bigotry,” the Indivisible Project said in a statement Saturday. “Tonight and tomorrow, we will join our fellow Americans across the country to hold events to show solidarity with those who bravely stood against the white supremacists in Charlottesville, and for all those who stand to lose under the hateful, bigoted agenda they push.”In Washington, D.C., on Sunday evening, a crowd of about a thousand gathered outside the White House with signs decrying the events at the white supremacy rally as terrorism. On Saturday, President Donald Trump was widely criticized for not singling out the activity of white supremacists and instead arguing that there was blame to go around on “many sides.”The protesters marched toward the city’s statue of Albert Pike, a Confederate general during the Civil War, and chanted demands to “tear it down.”Armed with bats, flags and chemical sprays, white nationalists and counter-protesters fought on the streets of downtown Charlottesville on Saturday. In addition to Heyer’s death, tragedy struck again when a Virginia state police helicopter responding to the rally crashed seven miles from the riot, killing the two state troopers who were inside.At least 35 people were reported injured throughout the day, including 19 when the car rammed into Heyer and other counter-protesters.The outpouring of solidarity is appreciated, one of the Charlottesville counter-protesters told ABC News on Sunday.“My sister was almost killed by that driver,” said Tommy, an organizer for the Richmond, Virginia, chapter of Democratic Socialists of America who only provided his first name. “Speaking for our little chapter in DSA, when we see [marches and rallies] springing up across the country, it just means so much that so many people are willing to stand with us ― and also fight with us.”Indivisible is partnered with several large nonprofit groups, including the Women’s March, Greenpeace, the Sierra Club, Planned Parenthood and America Action.Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced Saturday night that the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Virginia had opened up a federal investigation into the rally, saying that actions arising “from racial bigotry and hatred” cannot be tolerated. The FBI’s regional office in Richmond, Virginia, along with the U.S. attorney’s office, has also opened a civil rights investigation into the fatal car crash.President Donald Trump condemned the display of “hatred, bigotry and violence” at the rally, but said the blame could be placed on “many sides.” His response was widely criticized for not explicitly denouncing white supremacy or racism.This story has been updated to include more information on Indivisible.

Robert E. Lee in Emancipation Park Saturday night was littered with evidence of President Donald Trump’s cultivation of the far right: protest signs with messages like “The Jewish Media Is Going Down,” “The Goyim Know” and “We Support President Donald Trump.”Only several hours earlier here, white supremacist demonstrators and counter-protesters had engaged in open combat for hours. The sounds of screams had mixed with the sounds of people coughing, their lungs full of mace. Tear gas canisters and rocks and full water bottles and bags of feces flew through the air. Blood stained the sidewalk.A few blocks away at the intersection of Fourth Street and Water Street Saturday night, police collected evidence from where a 20-year-old white supremacist named James Alex Fields Jr. had allegedly plowed his car into marching counter-protesters, sending bodies flying. A 32-year-old paralegal named Heather Heyer was killed and at least 19 others were injured. Police removed metal barricades from the street as a helicopter circled overhead. Nearby bars, usually bustling on a Saturday night, were shuttered and empty. On the sidewalk, a lone “Always Anti-Fascist” poster — dropped or discarded during the day’s chaos — stared up from the sidewalk.Meanwhile, at a friend’s house in the area, 25-year-old Eli Mosley stepped away from a party he and his white supremacist buddies in the “alt-right” group Identity Evropa were enjoying to talk to HuffPost over the phone. His voice was hoarse. He had spent the day screaming and chanting among thousands of like-minded people carrying Nazi and Confederate flags to protest the potential removal of the giant Lee statue in the park. The Anti-Defamation League said it was the largest gathering of white supremacists in more than a decade.“Our people are feeling real good right now,” he said. “We view this is as a civil rights movement at this point. We’re advocating for white rights and white people, who will soon be a minority in this country. This day was a milestone pushing us into our next stage. We had a large turnout.”“We’re coming back to Charlottesville,” he added defiantly.The clashes like the one in Charlottesville are largely a phenomenon of the Trump era. Over the past year, HuffPost has followed the white nationalists in their escalating war with their extremist opposite, from Berkeley to Portland to New Orleans to Gettysburg. In May, again in Charlottesville, white nationalists marched with torches and chanted Nazi slogans. Over the course of these battles, each side has grown angrier, and more heavily armed.Eli Mosley is typical of the “alt-right” movement ― the latest incarnation of organized racism in America ― which has grown exponentially larger since Donald Trump announced his run for the White House. He’s young and media-savvy and knew how to bring thousands of white supremacists together for Saturday’s “Unite The Right” rally. Years ago people like Mosley saw themselves as a fringe group in American politics. Now, under Trump, they feel like their views are gaining momentum, even becoming mainstream, they say.In Trump’s statement about Charlottesville Saturday, he refused to specifically condemn the white supremacists who besieged this picturesque college town. “We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides ― on many sides,” he told reporters during a late-afternoon news conference in New Jersey. White supremacists were more than pleased with his reaction. “Trump’s comments were good,” read a post on the prominent white nationalist site Daily Stormer as they live-blogged yesterday’s events. “He refused to answer a question about White Nationalists supporting him,” the post continued. “No condemnation at all. When asked to condemn, he just walked out of the room. Really, really good. God bless him.”With a president of the United States not condemning Nazism, and after over a year of signaling his support for white nationalism, experts are deeply concerned that we’re in store for political violence even worse than the kind that visited Charlottesville.That’s because an emboldened fringe right, has in turn, emboldened the far left. Professor Brian Levin, head of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, said in an interview with HuffPost by phone that the fatality and injuries Saturday ensure that the “much smaller and less coalesced far left,” which includes anti-fascist or Antifa protesters, would go looking for “revenge.”“It’s a reciprocal dance of extremism,” Levin said.Heidi Beirich, head of the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Intelligence Project, agreed. When anti-fascists show up to violently fight white supremacists, she said, it only gives “oxygen” to the white supremacist cause.“We’re concerned this is going to spill out of Charlottesville into many other places,” she added.Something that would go a long way in breaking this vicious cycle, they both agreed, is decisive action from the White House.In a statement Sunday the Anti-Defamation League spelled out what that action could be. The group called on Trump to “terminate all staff” with any ties to white nationalists, likely referring to prominent White House advisers Steve Bannon, Steven Miller, and Sebastian Gorka, all of whom are linked to racist, fringe figures and groups.“This is a moment that demands moral leadership,” ADL President Jonathan Greenblatt said in a statement. “President Trump should acknowledge that this is not a matter of equivalence between two sides with similar gripes. There is no rationalizing white supremacy and no room for this vile bigotry. It is un-American and it needs to be condemned without hesitation.”On Sunday morning, Eli Mosley said he was preparing to leave the house where he had partied and slept the night before with his fellow white nationalists. He said he thought Trump’s comments were “neutral in a way” that he liked.He claimed to have lost his job three months ago after being exposed as a white nationalist online. He said he’s working full-time now as an alt-right organizer. For this new life, he said he was preparing to drive home to Pennsylvania Sunday so he could pack his things for a move to Virginia.In Virginia, he said, he could more easily organize the next big alt-right rallies in the state capital, Richmond, and of course, in Charlottesville.America does not do a good job of tracking incidents of hate and bias. We need your help to create a database of such incidents across the country, so we all know what’s going on. Tell us your story."
