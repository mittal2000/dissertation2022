0,POLITICS,Democrats Aren't Sure Whether To Make Jeff Sessions' Pot Crackdown An Election Issue,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jeff-sessions-marijuana-crackdown-democratic-party-election-politics_us_5a4ecee7e4b089e14db9ae04,Some are more eager to run on marijuana than others.,2018-01-05,Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Thursday that he had not yet seen Attorney General Jeff Sessions' change on marijuana policy.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a4ed1191d000027005c252e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Leading Democrats blasted Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ Thursday announcement that he would open the door to a federal crackdown on states that have decriminalized forms of marijuana use.Sessions’ action reverses a Department of Justice policy from the Barack Obama administration that effectively shielded those states from federal prosecution.Sessions “needs to focus on issues like transnational criminal organizations” and what the nation needs to do on “investigating and prosecuting human trafficking,” Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), a rumored 2020 presidential candidate, told HuffPost on Thursday.Sessions “needs to leave grandma’s medicinal marijuana alone!” she continued with a chuckle.Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), a centrist, declared that the move “would seem to be the absolute opposite direction of where the country’s headed and one more example of this administration being completely out of step with where both Americans are headed and, for that matter, Democratic and Republican state legislatures.”“This is a big mistake,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) told HuffPost. “In those states where the people in the states have made a determination to decriminalize or legalize marijuana ... the federal government would better spend its resources going after real problems we’ve got.”But criticizing Sessions’ move is one thing. Turning his marijuana crackdown into an election-year political cudgel ― in stump speeches, campaign literature and ads ― is something else entirely. And when asked whether Democrats planned to use the marijuana crackdown against Republicans in the November elections, some of the same Democrats keen to clobber Sessions were noncommittal.“It’s way too early to predict that,” Warner said.Van Hollen, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, the Democratic Senate campaign arm, said, “Every Democratic member of the Senate will have to decide what’s best in their states.” Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), who also expressed her displeasure with Sessions’ decision, argued that Democrats ought to run on kitchen-table economic issues rather than marijuana.“There are so many other things to run on, like the tax bill that just passed that does not help working families at all,” she said in an interview.The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee did not respond to multiple email requests for comment on the political salience of Sessions’ move. The DSCC referred HuffPost back to Van Hollen’s remarks.When asked about making marijuana an election issue, Democratic National Committee spokesman Michael Tyler provided a statement indicting Sessions’ “morally bankrupt and economically stupid” decision without commenting on the potential political effect. Part of the challenge for Democrats who might want to turn Sessions’ move into a partisan issue is that so many of their Republican colleagues responded with similar outrage. Lawmakers from states that have legalized the drug, including Sens. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), were especially firm in their criticism. In a scathing floor speech, Gardner, who chairs the National Republican Senate Committee, the GOP Senate’s campaign arm, said he was “prepared to take all steps necessary” to get Sessions to reverse the decision, including holding up Department of Justice nominees.Warner and Hirono both cited Republican condemnations in explaining the difficulty of making marijuana an election-year issue.Still other Democrats were reluctant to even condemn Sessions’ order. Sens. Bob Casey (Pa.), Jack Reed (R.I.) and Tammy Baldwin (Wis.), who faces a tough reelection battle, all said they were still too unfamiliar with Sessions’ action to comment. (Casey later issued a statement expressing “serious concerns about how this action by Attorney General Sessions could impact Pennsylvania’s medical marijuana law.”)Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) also pleaded ignorance when asked about the matter at a Thursday news conference.“I haven’t seen” Sessions’ comments on marijuana, Schumer said.Jeff Hauser, a former political communications chief at the AFL-CIO who runs the progressive Center for Economic and Policy Research’s executive branch accountability project, observed that congressional Republicans, partly at the prodding of the libertarian-leaning Koch brothers, have warmed to criminal justice reform in recent years.But Democrats would be mistaken to think that they are forfeiting opportunities for bipartisan progress by making an unrepentant drug warrior like Sessions a political liability for Republicans, according to Hauser.“If Democrats get elected in part on this platform, that will ultimately make passing a [bipartisan reform] bill more likely because Republicans will want to put the issue in the past,” Hauser said. “The way you get Republicans to repudiate hacks like Jeff Sessions is by causing them to pay a political price.”At the state level, Democrats appear less hesitant to make marijuana a significant part of their electoral strategy.Sessions’ action “will be a net positive for Democrats pretty much everywhere,” said Jared Leopold, communications director of the Democratic Governors Association.“I don’t see this as a winner for Republicans anywhere,” Leopold added. “But it’s especially a problem in a state like Colorado, where marijuana is a major source of revenue for the state government.” At least 15 Democratic gubernatorial candidates and current governors blasted Sessions’ decision, including Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, chairman of the Democratic Governors Association. Dr. Abdul El-Sayed, a former Detroit health director running for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in Michigan, where legalization is likely to be on the ballot in November, vowed in a statement that, if elected, he’d “fight [the crackdown] tooth and nail.” Later in the day, former Michigan Senate Democratic Leader Gretchen Whitmer, the frontrunner in the race for the state’s Democratic gubernatorial nomination, tweeted that Sessions’ “move takes us backward in our fight to level the playing field.”In Nevada and Colorado, two states with legal recreational pot where Republican attorneys general are seeking the GOP gubernatorial nomination, the Democratic Party was eager to jump on Sessions’ announcement.Two Colorado Democrats vying to succeed Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper ― Rep. Jared Polis and former Colorado Treasurer Cary Kennedy ― delivered stinging rebukes of Sessions’ decision. Polis slammed Sessions for “waging war on local marijuana;” Kennedy called it an “attack” on Colorado voters.By contrast, Colorado Attorney General Cynthia Coffman, a Republican who is running against Polis and Kennedy, reaffirmed her commitment to defending the Colorado law but declined to criticize Sessions’ decision. Coffman noted that it would still be up to federal prosecutors’ discretion and consequently admonished residents to “not freak out.”Nevada Democratic Party spokeswoman Hellen Kalla called on state Republicans, including Attorney General Adam Laxalt, to “clearly and firmly commit to standing up against any meddlesome attempt by the Trump administration to infringe upon our state’s right to grow our economy as our voters see fit.”Nevada Democratic gubernatorial candidate Steve Sisolak denounced the move as well, declaring, “We cannot and will not stand for this or any threat by the Trump administration to undo progress in Nevada.”But Laxalt, one of Sisolak’s opponents, merely offered a statement highlighting his past willingness to defend the state’s marijuana law against legal challenges despite his opposition to the ballot measure that legalize it.Rep. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), who is launching a competitive bid to unseat Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.), noted on Twitter that Heller voted to confirm Sessions despite knowing about Sessions’ “stance against marijuana legalization.”The polling on marijuana legalization suggests that it could be a potent issue at the ballot box. Nationwide, 64 percent of Americans support legalizing marijuana, an increase from 12 percent in 1969, according to Gallup. Broken down by party affiliation,Gallup found that legalization has the support of 72 percent of Democrats, 67 percent of independents and 51 percent of Republicans. As the data journalism site FiveThirtyEight observed, that makes marijuana legalization one of the least polarizing public policy issues in the country today.Since Democrats struggle to turn out infrequent voters during the midterms, the galvanizing power of protecting state-level marijuana laws could work in their favor. In 2014, the last nationwide midterm election cycle, 69 percent of voters in a pre-election poll said they were more likely to turn out if a marijuana legalization proposal were on the ballot. It is far from clear, however, that marijuana initiatives ultimately provided Democrats a meaningful boost in 2014. The party continued its midterm losing streak that year, prompting the Democratic National Committee to release an autopsy with recommended improvements a few months later.“I don’t see this as a partisan issue,” said Tom Angell, founder of the nonprofit Marijuana Majority. “Either party that wants to latch on to this will find that it will benefit them. The opportunity is there.”But the circumstances this fall are different from 2014 and more likely to benefit Democrats, according to several political strategists from both parties. There are now 29 states that have legalized some form of recreational or medical marijuana, including several, like Colorado, Washington and California, where it is already ingrained in the economy and culture. And with Democrats poised to ride a midterm election wave, Sessions’ marijuana offensive could further tip the scales against the GOP, these strategists say.Assuming federal prosecutors take advantage of the new powers Sessions has granted them, it is likely to be the most politically damaging in GOP-held swing districts with a higher proportion of libertarian or socially liberal voters, such as Washington’s 8th and California’s 45th, according to GOP strategist Liz Mair.“When you are looking at races that are potentially going to come down to a few hundred votes or a thousand votes, shit like that matters,” said Mair, who has advised leading conservatives, including Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R).Sunjeev Bery, a progressive strategist who has worked for MoveOn.org and the ACLU, predicted that “campaigning on that heavy-handed response is going to peel off independent voters, especially in places like Colorado.” What’s more, Bery said, “if the Trump administration goes after marijuana users in a state like California, that will significantly hurt their fundraising in high-net-worth libertarian communities like Silicon Valley.” Hauser of the Center for Economic and Policy Research argued that the marijuana crackdown buttresses an existing Democratic narrative about the Trump administration’s misplaced law enforcement priorities ― whether it involves police brutality or white-collar crime.“It can bring home to people who may or may not have been following other issues closely that Trump is a destabilizing force, and things that people have grown to rely on, including access to marijuana, can be taken away from them,” Hauser said. That message would likewise appeal to conservative-leaning libertarian voters fed up with federally driven encroachments on civil liberties, states’ rights or “free trade, free movement of people-type stuff,” according to Mair.“That just doesn’t play out West. And this fits into that narrative and that problem,” she said.Some progressives are already concerned, though, that Democrats are too timid to capitalize on Sessions’ action.In an NBC News column Thursday, New York City-based activist Sean McElwee appealed to Democrats to, among other things, abandon their historic reluctance to make marijuana reform a theme in campaign advertisements. “To really set their sights on large-scale change, top Democrats need to stop being so squeamish and lead with weed,” McElwee wrote.Castigating Democrats for their lack of backbone is a familiar refrain from the the party’s progressive base.And there is evidence to support their arguments. A widely cited 2013 study co-authored by two researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Michigan found that politicians in both parties assume that their voters are more conservative than they actually are.But Mair said that Sessions’ action would hurt Republicans at the ballot box regardless of how well Democrats campaign on marijuana policy.“Individual candidates are capable of overcoming” damaging national narratives, Mair said. “But your average congressional candidate from either party is not going to be a rockstar.”“Democrats don’t need to message on it,” she added. “The point will be made.”"

The recommendation fuels criticism that the committee’s investigation has splintered along party lines, with Republicans reportedly more interested in probing matters involving Trump’s 2016 rival, Hillary Clinton, as Trump grows increasingly frustrated with the FBI’s Russia probe. In a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray, Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) recommended a criminal investigation of Christopher Steele for possibly violating the U.S. law that prohibits individuals from making false statements to federal investigators. Steele is the author of a now-infamous dossier of research memos that include damaging claims about Trump and his business dealings in Russia. The dossier was commissioned in June 2016 by Fusion GPS, a Washington, D.C.-based research firm.Fusion GPS attorney Joshua Levy criticized the senators’ letter as a potential “attempt to discredit government sources, in the midst of an ongoing criminal investigation.” “We should all be skeptical in the extreme,” he told The Washington Post.The dossier has been a source of controversy since its contents were made public early last year. The document includes several incendiary claims about the president, including that his campaign colluded with Russian officials. It also includes an unsubstantiated account of Trump hiring Russian prostitutes to perform “golden showers” in front of him at a Moscow hotel suite. Trump has denied the claims and called the document “fake.”In October, details emerged about how the Fusion GPS research was funded. The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative-leaning news site, hired the firm to do opposition research about Trump during the Republican primaries, but stopped funding the work after Trump became the presumptive GOP nominee in spring 2016. The firm was then hired by the Democratic National Committee and Clinton’s presidential campaign, after which it tapped Steele to compile information on Trump.The revelation about the Clinton campaign’s ties to the document renewed Trump’s attacks. In December, he called the dossier a “Crooked Hillary pile of garbage.” While the dossier’s claims have not been verified, Robert Mueller — the special counsel leading the FBI’s Russia probe — reportedly had his investigators speak to Steele last year."

The fourth woman, Haggis’ former publicist Haleigh Breest, accused Haggis in December of raping her in 2013. Also in December, Breest sued Haggis for $9 million and he sued her for intentional infliction of emotional distress. All of the alleged incidents took place between 1996 and 2015. In a statement to HuffPost, Haggis’ attorney Christine Lepera vehemently denied all four allegations. She noted that Haggis believes these accusations may stem from Scientology. Haggis has long-been a vocal critic of the religion and its affiliated organizations. Lepera’s full statement said:Mr. Haggis denies these anonymous claims in whole.All three of the new accusers, who chose to stay anonymous, told the AP that they were just starting out in the movie business when Haggis allegedly took advantage of his position in power. The first woman alleges that Haggis sexually assaulted and raped her when she was a 28-year-old publicist working on a TV show he was producing in 1996. According to her account, Haggis wanted to review photos from the show in the young woman’s office when he began forcibly kissing her. “I just pulled away. He was just glaring at me and came at me again. I was really resisting. He said to me, ’Do you really want to continue working?’” the woman told the AP. “And then he really forced himself on me. I was just numb. I didn’t know what to do.”She said Haggis then made her perform oral sex and raped her on the office floor. The second accuser told the AP that Haggis sexually harassed her in the late 2000s in Los Angeles when she was trying to sell him on a new TV show. The woman said that Haggis attempted to kiss her during a late-night meeting, telling her that he and his wife had an arrangement where he could have sex with other people.The woman quickly realized what was happening and ran for her car. Although she says Haggis ran after her, she got home safely. The third woman told the AP that Haggis forcibly kissed her multiple times and followed her into a cab when the two were in Canada in 2015. When the cab arrived at her apartment, the third accuser says Haggis chased her to her door and forcibly kissed her until she was able to escape into her home. Breest, the first woman to accuse Haggis of assault, says that the “Million Dollar Baby” screenwriter and “Crash” director raped her in his Manhattan apartment in 2013. According to Breest’s lawsuit, Haggis became “sexually aggressive” and forced her into a bedroom. She reportedly told him “no” but she says Haggis then forced her to perform oral sex and raped her. The three new accusers told the AP they were inspired by the recent #MeToo movement to come forward and tell their stories. They came forward to Breest’s lawyers after she filed her lawsuit against Haggis on Dec. 15, 2017.This article has been updated to include comments from Haggis’ attorney to HuffPost. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story indicated that Breest filed her lawsuit against Haggis before he sued her. According to Variety, his suit, which referenced her threat to sue, was filed “a few hours” before hers."

A team of researchers analyzed rates of coral bleaching around the tropics over the past four decades, events that most often occur when seawater becomes too warm for coral to remain healthy. Scientists discovered that in the 1980s, severe coral bleaching events occurred only about once every 25 to 30 years. But, in the six years after 2010, the rate between bleachings plummeted, and mass events now occur about once every six years.“Before the 1980s, mass bleaching of corals was unheard of, even during strong El Niño conditions, but now repeated bouts of regional-scale bleaching and mass mortality of corals has become the new normal around the world as temperatures continue to rise,” Terry Hughes, the study’s lead author and the director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies in Australia, said in a statement.The paper warns that climate change could eventually lead to such events every year.While reefs that bleach ― so named because once-colorful corals turn white ― aren’t immediately killed, many of the creatures die in the intervening days and weeks. A mass bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef in 2016 left up to two-thirds of parts of the reef dead, and a back-to-back event in 2017 left some scientists in shock.Some corals, however, are able to recover if ocean temperatures return to normal and they’re given enough time to build up their health. But it usually takes 10 to 15 years for the fastest-growing species to recover, the paper states, and “far longer for the full complement” on a reef.The shorter time-frame between mass bleachings reported in the paper makes such recovery increasingly difficult, the authors write, and our rapidly warming world doesn’t seem likely to give corals a respite.Scientists have long said the world has already warmed 1 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels, or about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit. And if greenhouse gas emissions ― the prime driver of global warming and, in turn, coral bleaching ― remain unchecked, warming will skyrocket.“Reefs have entered a distinctive human-dominated era ― the Anthropocene,” Mark Eakin, a co-author of the paper and a reef scientist at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said in a statement. “The climate has warmed rapidly in the past 50 years, first making El Niños dangerous for corals, and now we’re seeing the emergence of bleaching in every hot summer.”The paper concludes on a somber note and urges global action to address climate change.“Our analysis indicates that we are already approaching a scenario in which every hot summer, with or without an El Niño event, has the potential to cause bleaching and mortality at a regional scale,” the authors write. “The future condition of reefs, and the ecosystem services they provide to people, will depend critically on the trajectory of global emissions.”"

But, in the six years after 2010, the rate between bleachings plummeted, and mass events now occur about once every six years.“Before the 1980s, mass bleaching of corals was unheard of, even during strong El Niño conditions, but now repeated bouts of regional-scale bleaching and mass mortality of corals has become the new normal around the world as temperatures continue to rise,” Terry Hughes, the study’s lead author and the director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies in Australia, said in a statement.The paper warns that climate change could eventually lead to such events every year.While reefs that bleach ― so named because once-colorful corals turn white ― aren’t immediately killed, many of the creatures die in the intervening days and weeks. A mass bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef in 2016 left up to two-thirds of parts of the reef dead, and a back-to-back event in 2017 left some scientists in shock.Some corals, however, are able to recover if ocean temperatures return to normal and they’re given enough time to build up their health. But it usually takes 10 to 15 years for the fastest-growing species to recover, the paper states, and “far longer for the full complement” on a reef.The shorter time-frame between mass bleachings reported in the paper makes such recovery increasingly difficult, the authors write, and our rapidly warming world doesn’t seem likely to give corals a respite.Scientists have long said the world has already warmed 1 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels, or about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit. And if greenhouse gas emissions ― the prime driver of global warming and, in turn, coral bleaching ― remain unchecked, warming will skyrocket.“Reefs have entered a distinctive human-dominated era ― the Anthropocene,” Mark Eakin, a co-author of the paper and a reef scientist at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said in a statement. “The climate has warmed rapidly in the past 50 years, first making El Niños dangerous for corals, and now we’re seeing the emergence of bleaching in every hot summer.”The paper concludes on a somber note and urges global action to address climate change.“Our analysis indicates that we are already approaching a scenario in which every hot summer, with or without an El Niño event, has the potential to cause bleaching and mortality at a regional scale,” the authors write. “The future condition of reefs, and the ecosystem services they provide to people, will depend critically on the trajectory of global emissions.”"
8,ENTERTAINMENT,Logan Paul 'Dead Body' Video Spurs Thousands To Petition To Get Him Off YouTube,Kimberly Yam,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/logan-paul-dead-body-petition_us_5a4f97bee4b089e14dba6cd7,"“A man who had family and friends chose to end his life, and you chose to share his death to your millions of followers without thinking about how his family/friends felt?”",2018-01-05,Multiple petitions are calling for YouTube to ban vlogger Logan Paul's channel after he posted a video of a suicide victim in Japan.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a4fc5a71c0000220068ed29.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Thousands of people want Logan Paul off their screens. A Change.org petition entitled “Delete Logan Paul’s YouTube Channel,” has garnered more than 190,000 signatures as of Friday afternoon following the YouTuber’s recent “dead body” video, which featured disturbing footage of an apparent suicide victim in Japan’s Aokigahara forest. Paul has since removed the vlog and issued a written and video apology in light of the immense backlash. “A man who had family and friends chose to end his life, and you chose to share his death to your millions of followers without thinking about how his family/friends felt?” the petition reads. “It’s disgusting and shouldn’t be tolerated.”The petition is hardly the only one protesting Paul’s YouTube channel, though it has received more signatures than others on Change.org. Multiple petitions call for YouTube to ban Paul from the platform, citing the vlogger’s disrespect of Japan and its culture and the trivial way suicide was discussed in the video.YouTube previously told HuffPost in a statement that it had issued a Community Guidelines strike to Paul’s channel. When a user has a strike on the account, he or she may not have access to some YouTube features. The strike doesn’t last forever, however, and expires after three months. “Our hearts go out to the family of the person featured in the video,” YouTube said in the statement. “YouTube prohibits violent or gory content posted in a shocking, sensational or disrespectful manner. If a video is graphic, it can only remain on the site when supported by appropriate educational or documentary information and in some cases it will be age-gated.”The petitions echo the flood of criticism Paul’s received over the week. Even celebrities have chimed in to underscore how insensitive the vlogger’s behavior was, including fellow YouTuber Anna Akana, whose sister died by suicide.Akana questioned Paul’s claim that he’d been trying to spread mental health awareness through the video. A Japanese vlogger who goes by the name of Reina Scully also shared her thoughts on the video. Judging by his other vlogs in Japan, she said, Paul seems to think of Japanese people as “caricatures” rather than human beings. “As a Japanese national citizen who grew up in the U.S. with a green card, there were a lot of times where I was treated as though I was really tiny and I was a child,” Scully said. “It’s definitely because I’m foreign. ... It’s definitely alarming in the worst of ways, and after watching some clips of Logan Paul’s other blogs in Japan ... there’s a sliver of what I used to experience of how people used to talk down to me because I was foreign.” If you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

Rashida Jones is just one of the 300 women in television, film and theater who launched the Time’s Up initiative on Monday, a campaign that seeks to end sexual harassment and inequality in workplaces nationwide.The “Parks and Recreation” star is also one of many actresses planning to wear all black to the event to protest sexual harassment. Actresses will likely also wear a small black-and-white “Time’s Up” pin as an accessory. Ahead of Sunday night, Jones spoke to InStyle about the protest and defended the red carpet blackout from critics who view it as divisive or ineffective.“This is not a silent protest,” the actress told the magazine Thursday. “I don’t think why we wear black is divisive as much as it is being discussed and debated without all the facts. Many women on the red carpet will discuss what’s important to them about their choice to protest and wear black.”“We wear black to stand in solidarity with our sisters and to say time’s up on this imbalance of power and the abuses that come with it, regardless of what industry you work in,” Jones added. “It’s time for every workplace to look more like our world, where women have equal representation.”The Time’s Up initiative includes a legal defense fund that victims of sexual misconduct can tap into to fight their cases in court. Actress America Ferrera, another supporter of the campaign, recently explained why the initiative is important and is inclusive. “We’re saying Time’s Up on silence, Time’s Up on waiting for things to change, Time’s Up on any behavior or culture that makes women less safe in the workplace,” Ferrera said on “The Late Show” on Wednesday night. “Women and people of color and LGBTQ people and disabled people and anyone else. It stands for all of us.”"
10,PARENTS,What Should You Say To Kids When Their Fave YouTube Stars Cross The Line?,"Common Sense Media, ContributorWe rate, educate, and advocate for kids, families, and schools.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-should-you-say-to-kids-when-their-fave-youtube_us_5a4fcabce4b0ee59d41c0a6c,Talk about the way YouTube works.,2018-01-05,<p>Prompt kids to think more deeply about the ethics of outrageous YouTube stunts.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a4fd65f1d000018005c279a.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Caroline Knorr, Common Sense Media“Terrible.” That’s what we said when YouTube gamer PewDiePie was found to have racist and anti-Semitic videos. “Tragic.” That was the reaction when a Minnesota woman fatally shot her husband in a YouTube stunt gone wrong. “Shameful.” That was the combined response to YouTube vlogger Logan Paul’s broadcast of a dead body hanging in Japan’s so-called suicide forest. But what’s clearly offensive to parents is a big gray area for kids ― especially when it’s one of their beloved YouTube celebs. The site’s anything-goes attitude, stars who feel like personal friends, and ― frankly ― parents’ disapproval only strengthen kids’ connection to their favorite personalities. Still, it’s important to discuss the outrageous behavior they’re seeing and hearing about. Why? Because, next to you, YouTube is one of the most powerful influences in their lives.While there’s plenty of good stuff happening on YouTube, it’s not surprising that its stars push the boundaries of good taste. For one, they’re mostly young, unfiltered, and bound to make some very public mistakes. Also, the more extreme the antic, the more page views they get, which can translate into millions of dollars.Here’s the way these things usually go: A YouTuber does or says something totally shocking; half of the internet erupts into outrage; and the other half rushes to the YouTuber’s defense. The offending video is taken down ― but not before people flock to the channel to see what the controversy is all about. To complete the cycle, the YouTuber issues an apology video. Along the way, the YouTuber increases his or her notoriety, racks up tons of views, and miraculously strengthens their fan base. Google may give them a slap on the wrist, but it also gets a percentage of the hosts’ ad revenue ― which is bolstered by the page views ― making it seem as though no stunt is too extreme to film for public consumption. Even after his offensive videos were discovered and Disney dropped him from a planned deal, PewDiePie is still one of the highest-paid internet stars.It’s a process lots of parents recognize as sensationalistic and exploitive. But kids feel protective of YouTube and its stars. YouTube is their go-to for news, pop culture, and trends. The hosts introduce them to cool, trendy new stuff, from video games to makeup and fashion. YouTubers bolster this connection by collecting followers on all social media, including Snapchat, Twitter, and Instagram, sharing intimate secrets, and even making personal appearances. Parents tend not to watch it as much, and kids feel like they “own” the platform. So when you throw shade on YouTube, kids can take it personally, and it can feel like a criticism of them. Here are some ways to open a discussion about YouTube so your kids won’t shut down:Talk about the way YouTube works. YouTubers earn money based on their number of page views and subscribers. The more page views, the more money. Often, this “attention economy” means saying or doing outrageous things for attention ― even negative attention. Ask: Do you think YouTubers have to go to extremes to attract views? Is Google responsible for helping YouTubers make money off crazy pranks? Do you think it’s OK to watch people get hurt or do risky things? Should advertisers pull their support when YouTubers cross the line?Talk about YouTubers’ influence. YouTubers influence kids more than traditional celebritiesbecause of the close relationship they forge with their fans. Brands such as Pepsi, Doritos, and Taco Bell love partnering with YouTubers because it makes them look cool and increases awareness even when the YouTubers behave inappropriately. Ask: Would you be more likely to want a product that’s endorsed by a YouTuber? Would you boycott a product endorsed by a YouTuber who released offensive videos?Talk about safety. YouTubers ― including the guy who cemented his head into a microwave ― have shown that they are willing to do almost anything in the competition for page views. It’s important for kids to see the aftermath of such stupid pranks, like the press conference by the emergency team who had to forgo helping people with legitimate medical issues to rescue that doofus. Say: Don’t ever do anything illegal or dangerous! And make sure your friends don’t either.Talk about sticking to YouTube’s good stuff. From Minecraft tutorials to cooking shows, there are lots of good shows on YouTube, as well as positive role models. Help younger kids make playlists of channels you’ve pre-approved and encourage them to get your permission before searching around on YouTube, which can bring up stuff that’s not appropriate. Ask: What subjects are you interested in? I wonder if they have a YouTube channel for that. Also, ask kids to tell you about their favorite YouTubers who don’t do icky or risky stuff.Talk about where you draw the line. Lecturing about how offensive some YouTubers are will probably fall on deaf ears. (Kids may even doubledown on their support for the offender so they don’t look bad for liking someone who messed up.) Instead, simply state where you stand on such content. You want your kids to get the message that you trust them to make good decisions on their own. Say: I won’t watch shows where people risk their safety or make light of something really serious, like suicide or violence. "

Since 2015, her eyelashes had been curling into her eye, rubbing and scratching against the cornea until it was too painful to lift the lids to see. “I had tears falling from my eyes, but it hurt too much to wipe them. I had a headache all the time, so I couldn’t do anything. I couldn’t go to the market; I couldn’t go to weddings.” Bugune had been suffering from trachoma, a bacterial eye infection that is the world’s leading cause of preventable blindness but that has long been neglected — especially in Ethiopia, which is home to the largest population of sufferers by far.The country is today the last major frontier in the global battle against the disease, but, despite recent efforts, public understanding of the disease and its causes remains poor — pushing the goal of elimination just beyond reach. “I thought I was never going to see again,” Bugane said of the agonizing uncertainty of previous weeks. “I was so scared.” Trachoma has been around for millennia. Traces of it have been found in the eyelids of Egyptian mummies, and it was once common across much of Europe and America. But today the disease is almost entirely confined to the world’s poorest countries, in particular the hot, arid regions of sub-Saharan Africa. Women, as primary caregivers, suffer disproportionately because children are more likely to be infected. And women are four times more likely than men to need surgery.“It is a disease of poverty,” explained Teshome Gebre, the International Trachoma Initiative’s regional director for Africa, in his office in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa. “You don’t find it in the developed world or even the developing world.”Of the 42 countries where trachoma is still present, Ethiopia has more than 30 percent of Africa’s already disproportionate burden. About 75 million Ethiopians — three-quarters of the population — live in trachoma-endemic areas, while the backlog of people urgently needing surgery for trachiasis, the advanced form of the disease, last year reached 693,000, the largest number of any country in the world. Bugune’s village of Toga is in the central region of Oromia, about four miles from the provincial boomtown of Shashamane, where the disease is typically much less common.“The further you go from the main road, the more prevalent trachoma is,” explained Oumer Shafi Abdurahman, former director of Ethiopia’s Neglected Tropical Diseases program and now project manager for Stronger-SAFE, a Wellcome Trust-funded initiative led by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine that aims to increase understanding of the disease.In some villages in the bushland surrounding Shashamane, where Oumer works, as many as 9 out of 10 children can be infected at any one time.Yet trachoma is easily treatable with antibiotics and simple surgery, and the campaign to eliminate it by 2020, the World Health Organization’s global target, should be attainable, some experts believe. Since 2012, Ethiopia has made significant strides, in particular by pioneering the Global Trachoma Mapping Project, the largest survey of an infectious disease, by using mobile phones and GPS signals to collate the country’s first national trachoma database.The survey found that more than 90 percent of districts in Ethiopia have trachoma at critical levels, a revelation that helped spur the government and its donors to taking more decisive action.In 2014, the federal minister of health announced a $1.7 million “fast-track initiative” to clear the then-estimated backlog of more than 800,000 people in need of surgery by the end of 2016, in part by training specialists to perform surgery at clinics across the country.With the help of organizations like the Fred Hollows Foundation, it has also embarked upon a vast program of drug distribution, doling out antibiotics to entire communities — every man, woman and child — in order to curb transmission.Ethiopia’s health extension program has advanced rapidly in a decade, with some 6,000 clinics and 48,000 extension workers nationwide making it possible to deliver doses of antibiotics to the most remote parts of the country.In Oromia alone, nearly 7 million doses of antibiotics were delivered in 2016 —reaching 94 percent of a targeted population — and a similar number have been reached this year. “Even though it is a very poor country, the system has worked” to deliver a mass antibiotic program, Oumer said. “And now that surgery is freely available, almost everywhere, there’s no reason for someone to go blind because of trachoma.”For a country that 15 years ago had no national program to combat the disease and very little commitment from the central government, this is a remarkable turnaround.The question now is whether Ethiopia can join the ranks of other countries that have recently eliminated trachoma. Yet many are doubtful because, despite improvements, progress has not been as swift as they had hoped. Bugune and her family knew little about trachoma, despite the government’s public awareness campaign. In their circular, thatched-roof homestead less than a mile from the health center, Bugune’s husband, Araba, would remove the eyelashes manually, one by one. He urged her to visit the doctor, but for months she refused.Neither knew of the strong link between transmission and poor hygiene: Bugane said she thought her eye problems were caused by smoke in the house, and her husband agreed. “I don’t need to learn this,” he said. “When there is smoke in the house people get trachoma.”Their neighbors were similarly uncertain. Their son Birhane suggested that light reflected from car windows might cause eye problems. But it is more than just lack of public awareness that is slowing progress. “Compared to the scale of the investment, the results have not been as expected,” Oumer admitted. “In the Amhara region of Ethiopia, which has had mass treatment for over seven years, it simply should have gone by now.”One reason, he thinks, is that trachoma’s biology is still poorly understood by the scientific community.“What we don’t know is probably more than we do know.” His Stronger-SAFE team is trying to work out precisely what lies behind transmission so that prevention methods can become more effective. The Shashamane-based researchers are examining local behavior, including water use, overcrowding and hygiene standards in affected villages, to try to pinpoint the causes.Some experts, for example, wonder whether its extreme prevalence in Ethiopia is a result of cultural factors, such as washing habits or diet.Others think that only economic development, particularly improved water access and sanitation, can wipe out the disease.Oumer disagrees. “There’s no reason why it shouldn’t go here. There are poor countries with no trachoma. There must be something we are doing wrong.”In November 2012, the WHO validated Oman as having eliminated trachoma, while China, Gambia, Ghana, Iran, Morocco and Myanmar have also claimed victory in recent years. (It was considered eliminated in the U.S. by the mid-20th century.)Oumer and others doubt Ethiopia can meet the 2020 target, though he thinks that elimination of trichiasis — the advanced form of the disease that caused Bugune’s eyelashes to grow inward — might still be within reach. Bugune, meanwhile, is fatalistic.She is not, after all, the only one in her family to have suffered. Her brother’s wife recently had successful surgery on her right eye, but now the other eye is infected.“I think it will come back for me, too,” Bugune said. “But if I go blind, my husband will guide me. It is his duty.” This series is supported, in part, by funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. All content is editorially independent, with no influence or input from the foundation. "

And women are four times more likely than men to need surgery.“It is a disease of poverty,” explained Teshome Gebre, the International Trachoma Initiative’s regional director for Africa, in his office in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa. “You don’t find it in the developed world or even the developing world.”Of the 42 countries where trachoma is still present, Ethiopia has more than 30 percent of Africa’s already disproportionate burden. About 75 million Ethiopians — three-quarters of the population — live in trachoma-endemic areas, while the backlog of people urgently needing surgery for trachiasis, the advanced form of the disease, last year reached 693,000, the largest number of any country in the world. Bugune’s village of Toga is in the central region of Oromia, about four miles from the provincial boomtown of Shashamane, where the disease is typically much less common.“The further you go from the main road, the more prevalent trachoma is,” explained Oumer Shafi Abdurahman, former director of Ethiopia’s Neglected Tropical Diseases program and now project manager for Stronger-SAFE, a Wellcome Trust-funded initiative led by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine that aims to increase understanding of the disease.In some villages in the bushland surrounding Shashamane, where Oumer works, as many as 9 out of 10 children can be infected at any one time.Yet trachoma is easily treatable with antibiotics and simple surgery, and the campaign to eliminate it by 2020, the World Health Organization’s global target, should be attainable, some experts believe. Since 2012, Ethiopia has made significant strides, in particular by pioneering the Global Trachoma Mapping Project, the largest survey of an infectious disease, by using mobile phones and GPS signals to collate the country’s first national trachoma database.The survey found that more than 90 percent of districts in Ethiopia have trachoma at critical levels, a revelation that helped spur the government and its donors to taking more decisive action.In 2014, the federal minister of health announced a $1.7 million “fast-track initiative” to clear the then-estimated backlog of more than 800,000 people in need of surgery by the end of 2016, in part by training specialists to perform surgery at clinics across the country.With the help of organizations like the Fred Hollows Foundation, it has also embarked upon a vast program of drug distribution, doling out antibiotics to entire communities — every man, woman and child — in order to curb transmission.Ethiopia’s health extension program has advanced rapidly in a decade, with some 6,000 clinics and 48,000 extension workers nationwide making it possible to deliver doses of antibiotics to the most remote parts of the country.In Oromia alone, nearly 7 million doses of antibiotics were delivered in 2016 —reaching 94 percent of a targeted population — and a similar number have been reached this year. “Even though it is a very poor country, the system has worked” to deliver a mass antibiotic program, Oumer said. “And now that surgery is freely available, almost everywhere, there’s no reason for someone to go blind because of trachoma.”For a country that 15 years ago had no national program to combat the disease and very little commitment from the central government, this is a remarkable turnaround.The question now is whether Ethiopia can join the ranks of other countries that have recently eliminated trachoma. Yet many are doubtful because, despite improvements, progress has not been as swift as they had hoped. Bugune and her family knew little about trachoma, despite the government’s public awareness campaign. In their circular, thatched-roof homestead less than a mile from the health center, Bugune’s husband, Araba, would remove the eyelashes manually, one by one. He urged her to visit the doctor, but for months she refused.Neither knew of the strong link between transmission and poor hygiene: Bugane said she thought her eye problems were caused by smoke in the house, and her husband agreed. “I don’t need to learn this,” he said. “When there is smoke in the house people get trachoma.”Their neighbors were similarly uncertain. Their son Birhane suggested that light reflected from car windows might cause eye problems. But it is more than just lack of public awareness that is slowing progress. “Compared to the scale of the investment, the results have not been as expected,” Oumer admitted. “In the Amhara region of Ethiopia, which has had mass treatment for over seven years, it simply should have gone by now.”One reason, he thinks, is that trachoma’s biology is still poorly understood by the scientific community.“What we don’t know is probably more than we do know.” His Stronger-SAFE team is trying to work out precisely what lies behind transmission so that prevention methods can become more effective. The Shashamane-based researchers are examining local behavior, including water use, overcrowding and hygiene standards in affected villages, to try to pinpoint the causes.Some experts, for example, wonder whether its extreme prevalence in Ethiopia is a result of cultural factors, such as washing habits or diet.Others think that only economic development, particularly improved water access and sanitation, can wipe out the disease.Oumer disagrees. “There’s no reason why it shouldn’t go here. There are poor countries with no trachoma. There must be something we are doing wrong.”In November 2012, the WHO validated Oman as having eliminated trachoma, while China, Gambia, Ghana, Iran, Morocco and Myanmar have also claimed victory in recent years. (It was considered eliminated in the U.S. by the mid-20th century.)Oumer and others doubt Ethiopia can meet the 2020 target, though he thinks that elimination of trichiasis — the advanced form of the disease that caused Bugune’s eyelashes to grow inward — might still be within reach. Bugune, meanwhile, is fatalistic.She is not, after all, the only one in her family to have suffered. Her brother’s wife recently had successful surgery on her right eye, but now the other eye is infected.“I think it will come back for me, too,” Bugune said. “But if I go blind, my husband will guide me. It is his duty.” This series is supported, in part, by funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. All content is editorially independent, with no influence or input from the foundation. "

All of Westwick’s scenes will be reshot later this month with co-stars Bill Nighy, Anna Chancellor, Matthew Goode and Eleanor Tomlinson.The premiere of the three-part drama series was initially intended to air on Dec. 26, but was postponed indefinitely in November in the wake of accusations by actress Kristina Cohen, as well as two other women, Aurélie Wynn and Rachel Eck.Production on the actor’s other ongoing series, “White Gold,” which was in the midst of shooting its second season, has also been halted. “These are serious allegations which Ed Westwick has strenuously denied,” the network previously said in a statement ahead of the scheduled premiere. “The BBC is not making any judgement but until these matters are resolved we will not include ‘Ordeal by Innocence’ in the schedules. The independent production company making ‘White Gold’ has informed us that Ed Westwick has paused from filming while he deals with these allegations.”Westwick has since emphatically denied the allegations, while the Los Angeles Police Department continues an investigation into the claims. “It is disheartening and sad to me that as a result of two unverified and provably untrue social media claims, there are some in this environment who could ever conclude I have had anything to do with such vile and horrific conduct,” Westwick said in a statement on Instagram. “I have absolutely not, and I am cooperating with the authorities so that they can clear my name as soon as possible.”In November, director Ridley Scott made a similar decision when he erased Kevin Spacey from his film “All The Money in the World,” after multiple men came forward with sexual assault allegations.A new air date for “Ordeal by Innocence” has yet to be announced.

Both the Justice Department and the U.S. attorney’s office in Arkansas declined to comment to CNN about the investigation.The reopening of the investigation comes on the heels of the Justice Department’s move to also relaunch an investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while she worked as secretary of state, The Daily Beast reported Thursday.A former senior DOJ official told The Daily Beast that officials are aware of demands from President Donald Trump to investigate Clinton.Trump has been increasingly focused on Clinton as the investigation into his alleged ties with Russia has heated up. He tweeted Friday morning that the investigation into him is simply a “hoax.” The initial Clinton Foundation probe dates back to 2015, when the FBI began looking at people who made donations to the charity. In 2016, prosecutors with the Justice Department rejected a request from the FBI to expand the investigation, The Washington Post reports.Nick Merrill, spokesman for Clinton, told The Hill on Friday that the new probe is “disgraceful.”“Let’s call this what it is: a sham,” Merrill told the publication. “This is a philanthropy that does life-changing work, which Republicans have tried to turn into a political football. It began with a now long-debunked project spearheaded by Steve Bannon during the presidential campaign. It continues with Jeff Sessions doing Trump’s bidding by heeding his calls to meddle with a department that is supposed to function independently.”"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a4fb23b1c00003b0068ecc8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A 21-year-old Texas man has been sentenced to 15 years in prison for using Grindr to rob and assault gay men. Nigel Garrett pleaded guilty in federal court to using the popular gay dating app to target victims in four home invasions over a three-week period in the Dallas area last year. With three other men, Garrett passed himself off as a single gay man, and made arrangements to meet victims at their homes in January and February 2017, according to The Dallas Morning News. Once inside the homes, Garrett and the three other men ― Anthony Shelton, Chancler Encalade Jr., and Cameron Ajiduah ― assaulted their victims, tied them up and shouted anti-LGBTQ epithets. In each case, the men carried a gun, and stole personal property, including a car, from their victims, The Washington Post reported in May. Garrett’s sentence followed a plea agreement with federal prosecutors. Shelton, Encalade and Ajiduah also have pleaded guilty, and are awaiting sentencing, the Tyler Morning Telegraph reports.The Justice Department touted the sentence to show its commitment to prosecuting hate crimes.“Hate crimes are an attack on a fundamental principle of the United States to be free from fear of violence because of your sexual orientation, gender identity, race, color, religion, or national origin,” Acting Assistant Attorney General John Gore of the Civil Rights Division said in a statement. “The Department of Justice is committed to using every tool at its disposal to combat this type of violence.”North Texas Gay and Lesbian Alliance President Jeanne Rubin said in May, when the charges were brought, that she was grateful prosecutors recognized the seriousness of the crimes. “You can be scared as a homeowner if your neighbor is robbed,” Rubin told CBS 11 News, “but it’s different if you feel like you’re being targeted for some reason, and in this case, a whole community can feel like they’re targeted.”A Grindr spokesperson told HuffPost in an email that the app was “committed to creating a safe environment through a system of digital and human screening tools to help its users connect and thrive,” and also “encourages users to report suspicious and threatening activities.”“While we are constantly improving upon this process, it is important to remember that Grindr is an open platform,” the spokesperson said. “Grindr cooperates with law enforcement on a regular basis and does not condone abusive or violent behavior.” "

When host Angelica Nwandu asked Amara her thoughts on what some people are saying, the proud Afro-Latina said it was really important for her to “educate and inform people about Afro-Latinos” while on the reality show. But it seems the issue didn’t end there. On Thursday, the singer once again addressed accusations that she wears blackface by posting an adorable throwback video of herself participating in a beauty pageant when she was a child.“Well Yea I guess I was Born in a ‘Black Face Body!,’” Amara wrote in the Instagram caption for the video. “Its funny that I even have to go through this and show you baby pictures or videos to prove to blogs and people on social media that my skin color is not airbrushed or spray tanned nor do I take melanin shots to be black!”However, there has been at least one incident of someone imitating the singer in blackface. In 2016, former Dominican beauty queen Geisha Montes de Oca took the stage on the variety show “Aquí Se Habla Español” wearing blackface, an Afro wig and padding to make her butt look bigger. Amara reposted an image of Montes de Oca on Instagram with the question: “What did you all think?”The “Love & Hip Hop” star has also had to face people questioning her Afro-Latino identity before. In the first episode of the series, which debuted on Monday, the singer goes head-to-head with music producer Young Hollywood about her image. In the scene, the Latino producer tells her she should be “a little bit more Beyoncé, a little less Macy Gray,” adding that an Afro isn’t elegant. He also calls her “Nutella Queen,” questions what it means to be Afro-Latina and says the music industry wants a cookie-cutter star. During the altercation Amara reminds him that “not all Latinas look like J.Lo or Sofía Vergara or Shakira, so where are the women that look like myself?” The singer may have walked out of Young Hollywood’s studio that day, but this week she walked right into a multi-album deal with Fast Life Entertainment Worldwide and BMG.

But that was never really his plan anyway.",2018-01-05,"""Hamilton"" cast members Leslie Odom Jr., Javier Munoz, Anthony Ramos, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Okieriete Onaodowan, Daveed Diggs and Christopher Jackson at a meet-and-greet on June 18, 2015. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a3aad21160000783ecf24ef.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"NEW YORK ― People tend to assume that the original stars of “Hamilton” walked away from the groundbreaking musical with a hefty paycheck. After all, the average ticket price for their acclaimed show eventually hit well above $1,000. And everyone from President Barack Obama to Beyoncé and Meryl Streep attended performances, beginning all the way back in 2015. It was, and still is, a phenomenon of a theater production. In actuality, actor Anthony Ramos ― who originated the roles of statesman John Laurens and Hamilton’s eldest son, Philip, in the Tony Award–winning show ― said he and his co-stars made just enough money to cover their rent, bills and daily expenses.“On Broadway, we had to negotiate with our producers to share some [earnings]. That was an ongoing process, but everybody came to an agreement,” he told HuffPost. “But we didn’t ... the show didn’t financially make any of us rich. It provided for us and helped open doors to create other opportunities that helped us make money. But the show itself didn’t necessarily change my life or most people’s lives in the cast [financially]. The checks we get after that long negotiation for profit share have helped us after.” Ramos didn’t divulge exact salaries. The typical minimum salary for a Broadway star, he said, is around $1,800 a week, though people can reportedly negotiate up to $10,000 or even $20,000. Off-Broadway rates are anywhere between $300 and $1,000 a week, depending on the number of seats in a theater. Like in any other industry, Ramos believes success in the theater world hinges on an ability to fight for what you feel you deserve.“People don’t take into consideration that you won’t be in the show forever. You’re doing it eight times a week. You don’t get paid when you get hurt. You have to earn every single dollar,” he said. “Plus, when you leave the show, you don’t get any of that money. That’s it. You pay out your agent, your manager ― 10 percent, depending on what you’re doing. After paying taxes, and after it all adds up, you’re making good money, but you’re making just enough to live in New York City.”At the end of the day, Ramos said he can only hope that the projects he takes on now create “an opportunity to do something better that will hopefully pay you more and also be just as creatively fulfilling or more creatively fulfilling than the last thing. A lot of the times that doesn’t happen. It can take people years to get another great job. This entertainment game is a gamble.”I met Ramos at Primrose Cafe in the Clinton Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn late last year, not long after his new show, the Spike Lee–directed series “She’s Gotta Have It,” hit Netflix. In it, he plays the lovable Mars Blackmon, easily the fan favorite among the suitors for the series’ protagonist, Nola Darling. The role is one of several “great jobs” Ramos has taken on since he strolled off the stage of “Hamilton.”Ramos was chatting with Kate Fenneman Stokes when I arrived ― the woman, I would later learn, who helped secure him a college scholarship just a few years ago. “I had applied to schools, but my applications had gotten withdrawn,” he told me as he sipped a water at our corner table, “because we had some issues at home and we couldn’t fax or get the applications in in time.”Back then, Ramos was an 18-year-old baseball player living with his two siblings and single mother in one of Brooklyn’s housing projects. As a member of a low-income family, Ramos never saw college as a practical possibility, but the theater director at his high school, Sara Steinwess, encouraged the naturally talented Ramos to try out for the American Musical and Dramatic Academy (AMDA) in Manhattan anyway. She guided him through the audition process, helped him with his essays and paid for the application for the Seinfeld Scholarship Program, which Fenneman Stokes was overseeing at that time. “If there was any time in my life to be honest with someone, it was then,” Ramos said of his first meeting with Fenneman Stokes. “I just told her everything: I grew up in the projects, my dad was on drugs, my family’s got a history of alcohol and drug problems. No pun intended, but I was like, all I need is one shot. I just need somebody to give me a shot. The next thing you know, she’s crying, I’m crying, and a few days after that AMDA is calling me.”Despite his poor grades at the time, Fenneman Stokes gave Ramos the scholarship, which funded his tuition, fees, and room and board for four years.“Anthony was so special, it’s hard to explain,” Fenneman Stokes told me over email. “He had a deep passion and love for performing, and he just needed someone to support him. It’s hard to meet Anthony and not want to be that person.” Once at AMDA, Ramos said he worked harder than he’d ever worked before. “Always hustling,” as he described it. In between spending hours upon hours in rehearsal spaces, Ramos was “cleaning toilets, mopping, vacuuming, anything to make money.” He even worked in Victoria’s Secret part-time on top of his gig as one of the academy’s orientation leaders, in the midst of trying out for, and finally landing, a position in the school’s dance workshop. After putting his best foot forward, he graduated from a two-year program, got an agent and started going on any open call he could find, whether it was in New York or Ohio. The first role he booked was Paul San Marco in “A Chorus Line” at a summer stock theatre in New Bedford, Massachusetts. His audition was so memorable, in fact, that the producer offered him the part right then and there.He accepted, then turned down the role a few days later. “You got to be there all summer for $250 a week and I had just gotten agents at the time and they were like, ‘We don’t think you should do this job,’” Ramos explained. “I’m super green. I didn’t really know anything about the business or whatever. So I was like, ‘All right, my agent said I can’t really do this job,’ and the producer at that theater was super mad at me. Calling me, yelling at me, like, ‘You can’t say yes to a job and then back out!’”That was the first of many valuable lessons Ramos learned about the life of a flailing actor. Two or three months later, his agents dropped him. “You got to tell your agents when you’re going to Canada. You can’t just go to Canada,” he smirked. Ramos was cast in a few low-paying “hanky” shows before he joined a regional production of Miranda’s “In the Heights” at the Pioneer Theater Company in Salt Lake City in 2012. He went on to appear in Radio City’s Christmas Spectacular in New York City and book a job as a singer on a cruise ship. The latter gig had him preoccupied for nearly 10 months. “It was summer camp,” he said of the overseas adventure. “I was 21. I was in Europe for six months. It was wild.” When he finally returned to NYC, and another job with the Radio City Spring Spectacular fell through, Ramos was eager for any new opportunity. “I went to audition at [talent agency] Telsey for a show that was at a signature theater,” Ramos explained. “In an email, after I finish that open call, the casting director’s like, ‘We’re about to call you in for this thing called “Hamilton’s Mixtape.”’ And I was like, ‘“Hamilton’s Mixtape”? OK, cool, yeah, sure.’”Ramos auditioned for musical supervisor Alex Lacamoire and director Tommy Kail. Clearly, it turned out well.“They gave me the part that I eventually originated on Broadway,” Ramos said. “We did the four-week lab and then we had six months off. I worked at a bakery and a preschool. I shot my first super low-budget indie film in that time, too. Then, we were off-Broadway for six months, had a month off, and then we went on Broadway.” All in all, Ramos played his dual roles at the Richard Rodgers Theatre for 17 months before taking his final bow on Nov. 20, 2016. Ramos was still acting in “Hamilton” when Spike Lee ― who apparently saw the Lin-Manuel Miranda creation seven times ― approached him about “She’s Gotta Have It.”“Spike came to the Public Theater [where the production ran off-Broadway] and after the show, he stands up, in the second row, and is just clapping really aggressively and pointing and clapping and pointing,” Ramos described. “And my boy Chris Jackson, next to me, whispered through the side of his mouth, ‘He ain’t pointing at me!’” Lee greeted Ramos backstage that night and called him a month or so later to set up a meeting. Ramos went to his office and they got to know one another. (“It’s a slow burn with Spike, he’s really got to be sure,” Ramos said.) The two kept in frequent contact over the next few weeks until Lee made a proposal Ramos couldn’t refuse. “We sat down again, he gave me a copy of the script for ’She’s Gotta Have It’ and he told me he was thinking about me for Mars Blackmon.” Mars is the role Lee himself played in the original 1986 film, so Ramos, appropriately, freaked out. Fueled by nervous excitement, he began working with Lee on his tape for Netflix, who was backing the series.“This all happened over the course of like six to eight months,” he said. ”[I was] still in ‘Hamilton,’ super on the low, wasn’t talking to anyone about it until it was real.” Well, it got real. Ramos booked the role. Sadly, he said, he couldn’t devote himself to both a high-profile musical and a highly anticipated TV show. “I think my zeal for [‘Hamilton’] and my heart for the show wasn’t as full as I’d like it be or how I wanted it to be,” he said. “My bank account was thanking me, but my heart was like, ‘Yo, my man, what are you doing?’ Creatively, I wouldn’t be my best in both places.”He decided to focus 100 percent on the Netflix series, which follows one woman (DeWanda Wise) and her varied relationships with three lovers. As a guy from Brooklyn, playing a character from Brooklyn, representing the people of Brooklyn, Ramos was stoked.“Mars is kind of the voice of people from New York,” Ramos said. “All the side hustles, that was my real life. Spike made the character half-black, half-Puerto Rican. He sort of wrote the character with me in mind and developed it.”“He didn’t tell me that until after we started filming,” Ramos added.The 26-year-old, who also recently had a cameo in “Will & Grace” and is set to appear in big-budget films like “A Star Is Born” and “Godzilla: King of Monsters,” is just happy to be working on stories that say something, particularly “She’s Gotta Have It.”“There’s a lot of content out there that, unfortunately, I don’t feel is saying a lot,” he said. “This show talks about issues that are going on in New York and all over the world: sexual harassment, verbal abuse, physical abuse, gentrification, the one percent, the tax break, all sorts of things. It speaks for a lot of people who feel like they can’t speak up or don’t know what to say or don’t know how to express what they’re feeling or can’t quite define what they’re feeling. I’m proud to be a part of a piece of art that’s not only doing that but also giving people the courage to step out a little more and educate themselves on music, culture and political issues.”Ramos himself is attempting to say something in his own art. He’s gearing up to release an EP of songs he wrote directly following the 2016 election. The “vibe” he was sensing from people around him inspired tracks including “Freedom” and “Common Ground,” which touch on graver topics like immigration. Sitting with me in the cafe, Ramos spoke his lyrics: “I was told that a life has no price, you see / but the hate in your eyes put a price on me.” He’ll drop the record on the one-year anniversary of President Trump’s inauguration later this month.“You can’t just think that things will get better — it takes work,” he said. “Hard things bring great humility and we need humility in this country. I’m grateful that we’re having hard conversations and dealing with each other. Even if it doesn’t seem like we’re dealing with each other well, we’re dealing with each other. We’re actually hitting things head-on.” This kind of faith has helped the actor progress in both his life and career, and has allowed Ramos to envision himself as something more than just a “Hamilton” star. “It’s tough to get out of that box,” he said, explaining that he must “take the chains off” in his own mind before anyone else can see him in a new light.“My identity doesn’t lie in ‘Hamilton.’ My identity is not in Mars. It doesn’t lie in ‘Godzilla’ or whatever else I’ve been blessed to be a part of. People can label me however they want, but I know who I am at the end of the day and anyone who cares to come on the journey or get to know me will get to know me as an individual, and that’s all I really care about.”Thankfully, Ramos has a great support system, which includes a partner who understands exactly what he’s going through. Jasmine Cephas Jones also starred in the original cast of “Hamilton” as Peggy Schuyler and Maria Reynolds, and Ramos says she’s there for him every step of his post-show journey.“She keeps it real,” he told me. “You have someone who you can bounce off of who’s there constantly or someone who understands your point of view or where you’re coming from or can rebut your point of view. Having someone who is supportive is number one.”As our nearly two-hour conversation came to an end and we got up to leave, Ramos informed me that he’d be heading to Puerto Rico to help out in any way he could after Hurricane Maria devastated his family’s homeland. He’s since returned from that visit, calling the experience “the most overwhelming, inspiring and beautiful thing I think I’ve ever seen.” Alongside Miranda, who’s reprising his role in “Hamilton” for a three-week run on the island, Ramos also took part in the all-star single “Almost Like Praying,” which raised money for relief. He said he’ll “do anything” he can to let Puerto Rico residents know they’re not alone. “The only thing you leave in this world is a legacy,” Ramos said. “Eventually, your money gets spent. Eventually, your house gets sold. So what is your legacy going to be?”This piece has been updated with further comment from Ramos on his “Hamilton” income."
21,ENTERTAINMENT,"'Hamilton' Doesn't Define Anthony Ramos, King Of The Side Hustle",Leigh Blickley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/anthony-ramos-shes-gotta-have-it-hamilton_us_5a3a89c1e4b0b0e5a79ee169,"The newly minted ""She's Gotta Have It"" star didn't get rich from Broadway. But that was never really his plan anyway.",2018-01-05,"Spike Lee and Anthony Ramos on the ""She's Gotta Have It"" set. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a3ab8b8150000490049cc9a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"NEW YORK ― People tend to assume that the original stars of “Hamilton” walked away from the groundbreaking musical with a hefty paycheck. After all, the average ticket price for their acclaimed show eventually hit well above $1,000. And everyone from President Barack Obama to Beyoncé and Meryl Streep attended performances, beginning all the way back in 2015. It was, and still is, a phenomenon of a theater production. In actuality, actor Anthony Ramos ― who originated the roles of statesman John Laurens and Hamilton’s eldest son, Philip, in the Tony Award–winning show ― said he and his co-stars made just enough money to cover their rent, bills and daily expenses.“On Broadway, we had to negotiate with our producers to share some [earnings]. That was an ongoing process, but everybody came to an agreement,” he told HuffPost. “But we didn’t ... the show didn’t financially make any of us rich. It provided for us and helped open doors to create other opportunities that helped us make money. But the show itself didn’t necessarily change my life or most people’s lives in the cast [financially]. The checks we get after that long negotiation for profit share have helped us after.” Ramos didn’t divulge exact salaries. The typical minimum salary for a Broadway star, he said, is around $1,800 a week, though people can reportedly negotiate up to $10,000 or even $20,000. Off-Broadway rates are anywhere between $300 and $1,000 a week, depending on the number of seats in a theater. Like in any other industry, Ramos believes success in the theater world hinges on an ability to fight for what you feel you deserve.“People don’t take into consideration that you won’t be in the show forever. You’re doing it eight times a week. You don’t get paid when you get hurt. You have to earn every single dollar,” he said. “Plus, when you leave the show, you don’t get any of that money. That’s it. You pay out your agent, your manager ― 10 percent, depending on what you’re doing. After paying taxes, and after it all adds up, you’re making good money, but you’re making just enough to live in New York City.”At the end of the day, Ramos said he can only hope that the projects he takes on now create “an opportunity to do something better that will hopefully pay you more and also be just as creatively fulfilling or more creatively fulfilling than the last thing. A lot of the times that doesn’t happen. It can take people years to get another great job. This entertainment game is a gamble.”I met Ramos at Primrose Cafe in the Clinton Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn late last year, not long after his new show, the Spike Lee–directed series “She’s Gotta Have It,” hit Netflix. In it, he plays the lovable Mars Blackmon, easily the fan favorite among the suitors for the series’ protagonist, Nola Darling. The role is one of several “great jobs” Ramos has taken on since he strolled off the stage of “Hamilton.”Ramos was chatting with Kate Fenneman Stokes when I arrived ― the woman, I would later learn, who helped secure him a college scholarship just a few years ago. “I had applied to schools, but my applications had gotten withdrawn,” he told me as he sipped a water at our corner table, “because we had some issues at home and we couldn’t fax or get the applications in in time.”Back then, Ramos was an 18-year-old baseball player living with his two siblings and single mother in one of Brooklyn’s housing projects. As a member of a low-income family, Ramos never saw college as a practical possibility, but the theater director at his high school, Sara Steinwess, encouraged the naturally talented Ramos to try out for the American Musical and Dramatic Academy (AMDA) in Manhattan anyway. She guided him through the audition process, helped him with his essays and paid for the application for the Seinfeld Scholarship Program, which Fenneman Stokes was overseeing at that time. “If there was any time in my life to be honest with someone, it was then,” Ramos said of his first meeting with Fenneman Stokes. “I just told her everything: I grew up in the projects, my dad was on drugs, my family’s got a history of alcohol and drug problems. No pun intended, but I was like, all I need is one shot. I just need somebody to give me a shot. The next thing you know, she’s crying, I’m crying, and a few days after that AMDA is calling me.”Despite his poor grades at the time, Fenneman Stokes gave Ramos the scholarship, which funded his tuition, fees, and room and board for four years.“Anthony was so special, it’s hard to explain,” Fenneman Stokes told me over email. “He had a deep passion and love for performing, and he just needed someone to support him. It’s hard to meet Anthony and not want to be that person.” Once at AMDA, Ramos said he worked harder than he’d ever worked before. “Always hustling,” as he described it. In between spending hours upon hours in rehearsal spaces, Ramos was “cleaning toilets, mopping, vacuuming, anything to make money.” He even worked in Victoria’s Secret part-time on top of his gig as one of the academy’s orientation leaders, in the midst of trying out for, and finally landing, a position in the school’s dance workshop. After putting his best foot forward, he graduated from a two-year program, got an agent and started going on any open call he could find, whether it was in New York or Ohio. The first role he booked was Paul San Marco in “A Chorus Line” at a summer stock theatre in New Bedford, Massachusetts. His audition was so memorable, in fact, that the producer offered him the part right then and there.He accepted, then turned down the role a few days later. “You got to be there all summer for $250 a week and I had just gotten agents at the time and they were like, ‘We don’t think you should do this job,’” Ramos explained. “I’m super green. I didn’t really know anything about the business or whatever. So I was like, ‘All right, my agent said I can’t really do this job,’ and the producer at that theater was super mad at me. Calling me, yelling at me, like, ‘You can’t say yes to a job and then back out!’”That was the first of many valuable lessons Ramos learned about the life of a flailing actor. Two or three months later, his agents dropped him. “You got to tell your agents when you’re going to Canada. You can’t just go to Canada,” he smirked. Ramos was cast in a few low-paying “hanky” shows before he joined a regional production of Miranda’s “In the Heights” at the Pioneer Theater Company in Salt Lake City in 2012. He went on to appear in Radio City’s Christmas Spectacular in New York City and book a job as a singer on a cruise ship. The latter gig had him preoccupied for nearly 10 months. “It was summer camp,” he said of the overseas adventure. “I was 21. I was in Europe for six months. It was wild.” When he finally returned to NYC, and another job with the Radio City Spring Spectacular fell through, Ramos was eager for any new opportunity. “I went to audition at [talent agency] Telsey for a show that was at a signature theater,” Ramos explained. “In an email, after I finish that open call, the casting director’s like, ‘We’re about to call you in for this thing called “Hamilton’s Mixtape.”’ And I was like, ‘“Hamilton’s Mixtape”? OK, cool, yeah, sure.’”Ramos auditioned for musical supervisor Alex Lacamoire and director Tommy Kail. Clearly, it turned out well.“They gave me the part that I eventually originated on Broadway,” Ramos said. “We did the four-week lab and then we had six months off. I worked at a bakery and a preschool. I shot my first super low-budget indie film in that time, too. Then, we were off-Broadway for six months, had a month off, and then we went on Broadway.” All in all, Ramos played his dual roles at the Richard Rodgers Theatre for 17 months before taking his final bow on Nov. 20, 2016. Ramos was still acting in “Hamilton” when Spike Lee ― who apparently saw the Lin-Manuel Miranda creation seven times ― approached him about “She’s Gotta Have It.”“Spike came to the Public Theater [where the production ran off-Broadway] and after the show, he stands up, in the second row, and is just clapping really aggressively and pointing and clapping and pointing,” Ramos described. “And my boy Chris Jackson, next to me, whispered through the side of his mouth, ‘He ain’t pointing at me!’” Lee greeted Ramos backstage that night and called him a month or so later to set up a meeting. Ramos went to his office and they got to know one another. (“It’s a slow burn with Spike, he’s really got to be sure,” Ramos said.) The two kept in frequent contact over the next few weeks until Lee made a proposal Ramos couldn’t refuse. “We sat down again, he gave me a copy of the script for ’She’s Gotta Have It’ and he told me he was thinking about me for Mars Blackmon.” Mars is the role Lee himself played in the original 1986 film, so Ramos, appropriately, freaked out. Fueled by nervous excitement, he began working with Lee on his tape for Netflix, who was backing the series.“This all happened over the course of like six to eight months,” he said. ”[I was] still in ‘Hamilton,’ super on the low, wasn’t talking to anyone about it until it was real.” Well, it got real. Ramos booked the role. Sadly, he said, he couldn’t devote himself to both a high-profile musical and a highly anticipated TV show. “I think my zeal for [‘Hamilton’] and my heart for the show wasn’t as full as I’d like it be or how I wanted it to be,” he said. “My bank account was thanking me, but my heart was like, ‘Yo, my man, what are you doing?’ Creatively, I wouldn’t be my best in both places.”He decided to focus 100 percent on the Netflix series, which follows one woman (DeWanda Wise) and her varied relationships with three lovers. As a guy from Brooklyn, playing a character from Brooklyn, representing the people of Brooklyn, Ramos was stoked.“Mars is kind of the voice of people from New York,” Ramos said. “All the side hustles, that was my real life. Spike made the character half-black, half-Puerto Rican. He sort of wrote the character with me in mind and developed it.”“He didn’t tell me that until after we started filming,” Ramos added.The 26-year-old, who also recently had a cameo in “Will & Grace” and is set to appear in big-budget films like “A Star Is Born” and “Godzilla: King of Monsters,” is just happy to be working on stories that say something, particularly “She’s Gotta Have It.”“There’s a lot of content out there that, unfortunately, I don’t feel is saying a lot,” he said. “This show talks about issues that are going on in New York and all over the world: sexual harassment, verbal abuse, physical abuse, gentrification, the one percent, the tax break, all sorts of things.

22,POLITICS,She Quit Working For Trump. Now She's Running For Congress To Fight Him.,Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gina-ortiz-jones-will-hurd-texas-2018_us_5a4c069ce4b0b0e5a7a94c48,"Democrat Gina Ortiz Jones would be the first lesbian, Iraq War vet and Filipina-American to fill a U.S. House seat in Texas.",2018-01-05,"At 36, Gina Ortiz Jones has served in the Air Force, deployed to Iraq, worked as an intelligence officer and is now running for Congress.

Bush and as an intelligence officer under Barack Obama, stayed in her job as a director in the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. But by June, she couldn’t do it anymore. Trump’s plans to gut education and housing aid hit too close to home for Jones, as someone who relied on reduced-cost school lunches and subsidized housing when she was a kid being raised by a single mom in San Antonio. She was also appalled by the president’s hires for top jobs.“The type of people that were brought in to be public servants were interested in neither the public nor the service,” Jones, 36, said in an interview. “That, to me, was a sign that I’m going to have to serve in a different way.”She found a new way to serve: She’s running for Congress. Jones has never run for office before, and if she wins, she would make history as the first lesbian, Iraq War veteran and first-generation Filipina-American to hold a U.S. House seat in Texas. Her hometown district, Texas’ 23rd, has also never been represented by a woman.Jones wouldn’t have been able to grow up healthy or get an education without the opportunities she got from the federal government, she said. The only reason she could afford college, she added, was that she got a four-year Air Force ROTC scholarship — and it infuriates her to see politicians try to take away those chances for others.“Talent is universal. Opportunity is not,” she said. “Folks in Congress, they do three things. They create opportunities, they protect opportunities and they erase opportunities. That’s how we have to be thinking about this very plainly.”Jones, a Democrat, is trying to unseat two-term Rep. Will Hurd (R). It won’t be easy. She has to beat three other Democrats in the March 6 primary, including Jay Hulings, a well-known former federal prosecutor. If she can pull that off, she’ll face Hurd, who has the advantage of being the incumbent and well-financed. As of Sept. 30, Hurd had $870,000 in cash on hand compared with Jones’ $74,000.But Jones is certainly viable. She’s picked up endorsements from major national groups including EMILY’s List, VoteVets and Victory Fund. Former Texas Democratic state senator and gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis endorsed her. A couple of weeks ago, Khizr Khan, the Gold Star father who gave a passionate speech at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, announced his support for her campaign, too.“With leaders like Gina, our nation’s affairs are in good hands,” Khan said in a video announcing his endorsement. “I am supporting her for Congress because of her selfless, courageous leadership. She’s the leader we need for an interdependent world.”If she can win the primary, Jones has some advantages over Hurd. This district, which stretches halfway across the state thanks to insane gerrymandering, has flip-flopped between Democratic and GOP representation for years, with nobody holding it for more than two terms since 2007. Hurd won his first term in 2014 by 2,400 votes against Democratic Rep. Pete Gallego. In 2016, Hurd won by 3,000 votes. Those are pretty close races in a district where roughly 115,000 people voted in the midterm and 229,000 voted in the presidential election.This race is also happening amid a wave of Democratic victories around the country, with some high-level GOP operatives already bracing for a possible bloodbath in 2018.Jones expressed frustration that Hurd routinely votes against his constituents’ interests but seems to get away with it because of his reputation for being “the nice guy.” Last year, Hurd gave people warm fuzzies about bipartisanship by live-streaming a 1,600-mile road trip with Texas Democratic Rep. Beto O’Rourke. HuffPost thought it looked fun (even if it was a political calculation by O’Rourke, who proposed the trip and announced a Senate run weeks later). Jones scoffed.“When bipartisanship means two dudes get in a car and help each other get elected, we’re all fucking screwed,” she said.Instead, Jones ran through Hurd’s record. He voted to delay the implementation of smog reduction measures by eight years, despite 1 in 13 Texans having asthma (with even higher rates in communities of color, like his). He voted nine times to repeal the Affordable Care Act. He voted for the GOP’s tax bill, which benefits the rich and raises taxes on middle-class families over time. He’s been quiet about Congress’ failure to renew funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which is set to expire and would affect 400,000 kids in Texas.It’s particularly outrageous that Hurd hasn’t signed onto a bipartisan bill, the Dream Act, to preserve the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, Jones said. Trump ended the program in September, and young undocumented immigrants will begin losing protections in greater numbers in March unless Congress passes a law to keep it. If lawmakers fail to act, hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants are at risk of being deported.Jones said the uncertainty around DACA is “a huge deal” in Texas’ 23rd District, where more than 70 percent of constituents are Latino.“So I push back on the fact that some say, ‘Oh, he’s not that bad.’ His voting record is awful,” she said. “You don’t get to be a moderate just because you don’t say crazy shit.”Hurd’s campaign spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.Since moving back to San Antonio in June, Jones has been living in the house she grew up in. Most people in her community are minorities. Many are low-income. As she’s traveled around the district, she’s met people in border towns living in rank poverty. Some have no running water. Some have no paved roads. Jones said the experience has been a stark reminder of how badly Congress needs diverse voices ― and that now is the time for her to throw her hat in. “There’s just a point where you just ask yourself the question, ‘Can I afford not to do this?’” Jones said. “I think like a lot of women, you’re done assuming that somebody is going to do for you that which you can do yourself.”"

26,POLITICS,Trump As Tantrum-Prone Toddler? It’s Not Really News To The GOP.,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-gop-toddler-tantrum-personality_us_5a4e9df7e4b003133ec68ee9,Party leaders have known about the president’s personality issues since before he won the nomination.,2018-01-04,Dealing with Donald Trump has always been a challenge for Republican officials.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a4e9e9a2100003e005f7236.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Republicans might reasonably have a number of reactions to a new book’s portrayal of President Donald Trump as a delusional, puerile ignoramus ― betrayal at the participation of colleagues, fear that their agenda is further imperiled.But one emotion they cannot honestly express: surprise.Journalist Michael Wolff’s book, Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, describes the president as a blustering, attention-challenged chief executive with little interest in most of his duties and deteriorating cognitive skills. A former deputy White House chief of staff, Katie Walsh, is quoted as saying her job was “like trying to figure out what a child wants.”That blistering assessment is not much different from the way Republican leaders were describing him in private conversations from the time Trump sewed up the GOP nomination in late spring of 2016.One top Republican National Committee official described to HuffPost how then-party chairman Reince Priebus would have to preface any criticism of Trump with several statements of praise. Otherwise Trump would lash out and not heed the advice, the official said on condition of anonymity to describe their nominee candidly.When it was pointed out that was a common tactic for parents dealing with unruly preschoolers, the official smiled and shrugged.A GOP fundraiser, recalling a late summer 2016 gathering of donors where he met Trump for the first time, said he watched in amazement as Trump was so flattered by the attention that he insisted on being photographed and engaging in lengthy self-congratulatory conversations with every person in attendance. It threw off the schedule for the rest of the day. “OK, so our guy is insane,” he said, also on the condition of anonymity.All of those mental and personality traits now generating such chaos have been in full view for years, according to Rick Wilson, a Republican consultant in Florida who has been a vocal Trump critic since he entered the presidential race.“Of course, he’s overmatched since day one on the job,” Wilson said. “You would not put this person in charge of a Waffle House, let alone the White House.”Back in the summer of 2016, there was little thought even among GOP officials that Trump would actually become president. Rather, the goal was to temper his outbursts and unscripted statements so as to improve the chances that Republican members of Congress in Democratic-leaning states would retain their seats.“I thought the fight would be over keeping the Senate,” said Grover Norquist, head of the anti-tax group Americans for Tax Reform who was then and remains today close to Republican leaders in Congress and the White House. Norquist said he was as surprised as anyone when Trump wound up winning the election.Over his first year in the White House, Trump’s lack of knowledge about policy or even basic governance has been well documented, as has his continued unwillingness to accept criticism.One Republican close to the White House, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said that Trump still needs to be mollified with praise before being given bad news or unwelcome advice. “That’s how he is,” the person said.But Norquist said that his dealings with the White House in the recent push for tax cuts showed a president fully engaged. “On taxes, he’s focused and he gets it,” Norquist said.The tax cut legislation was perhaps the only bill that Trump dealt with all year that directly affected him and his personal finances. A last-minute change before the House and Senate cast their final votes gave the sort of businesses that Trump owns a 20 percent tax break ― a matter that certainly could have held the president’s attention."

But perhaps his greatest preparation comes from his talk show, “Late Night with Seth Meyers,” where he’s distinguished himself by tackling complex issues with aplomb on a daily basis. “We have at least a slight advantage in that we’ve been having those conversations each night on our show, addressing that and other issues that don’t naturally lend themselves to a lightness of mood,” Meyers explained. While President Donald Trump is a frequent topic on his show, Meyers says he’s aiming to focus on Hollywood, not Washington, at the ceremony, which he hopes will in the least inspire some tweets from the White House. “If he tweets that he’s disappointed we didn’t bring him up, I’d be thrilled,” he told THR. “That would fly in the face of what currently he believes is the problem, which is that we won’t stop talking about him.”To read Meyers’ full interview, head over to The Hollywood Reporter.

29,POLITICS,Houses Of Worship Damaged By Natural Disasters Can Now Receive FEMA Aid,Antonia Blumberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/churches-fema-disaster-aid_us_5a4e7229e4b003133ec6624b,"The decision is retroactive to mid-August 2017, when Hurricane Harvey hit Texas.",2018-01-04,"A Port Arthur, Texas, church is surrounded by water after Hurricane Harvey flooding inundated the area on Aug. 30, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a4e79de2100002c005f71d2.jpeg?cache=8NTS4RXW3D&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It just got a lot easier for houses of worship and other religious institutions to receive federal aid after a disaster hits.On Tuesday, the Federal Emergency Management Agency released a new policy guide stating that eligibility for federal disaster relief will no longer rest on whether a facility is used primarily for religious purposes.Specifically, “private nonprofit houses of worship will not be singled out for disfavored treatment within the community centers subcategory,” Alex Amparo, FEMA’s assistant administrator for recovery, wrote in the manual’s foreword.Prior to the policy change, churches and other houses of worship damaged in a disaster could receive FEMA grants if the funds were applied to schools, health care centers or other facilities not used primarily for religious purposes. They were also eligible to receive U.S. Small Business Administration loans to repair damaged buildings and reimbursement from local governments if they had sheltered evacuees. But religious sanctuary spaces were not eligible for federal aid.Faith leaders and constitutional advocates have long debated whether FEMA’s policy should change.Many religious groups and others, including President Donald Trump, argue that denying disaster aid to houses of worship constitutes religious discrimination under the free exercise clause of the First Amendment.But groups like Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the Interfaith Alliance contend that providing such federal assistance to religious institutions would violate the separation of church and state.Courts haven’t drawn a clear line on church-state separation either.The FEMA guide cites the U.S. Supreme Court’s June 2017 decision in Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia v. Comer, centered on a Missouri church denied state funds to improve its day care playground. The court ruled in favor of the church, which had sued the state’s natural resources department for religious discrimination.But when three Texas churches affected by Hurricane Harvey sued FEMA over its previous policy, a U.S. district court denied the plaintiffs a preliminary injunction on the grounds that the federal agency was not obligated to fund repairs to religious spaces.FEMA’s new policy will retroactively cover damage reported as early as Aug. 23, 2017, which would include those houses of worship affected by Hurricane Harvey."

Almost anywhere but a shelter.“My experience with shelters is that you’d go when it was raining. You’d go to San Francisco, wait in line and sleep on the floor, if you slept at all,” the serious, soft-spoken Oakland woman, who’s now 22, said last week. “It’s scary enough to be a young person there. But if you’re queer you just feel a lot more vulnerable. You definitely avoid them.”Alicia is still homeless but lives at a youth shelter in Oakland. She asked that her real name not be used to protect her identity.As the cost of housing continues to soar in California and elsewhere, an increasing number of young people have become homeless, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts. Among those homeless, one group has it especially tough: Young people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender.“There’s a myth of San Francisco as the ‘gay mecca,’” said Jodi Schwartz, executive director of Lyric, a nonprofit community center in San Francisco that serves LGBT youth. “It can be. But just for some.”The reality, she said, is that many LGBT young people end up on the street or in unstable housing. Many are there because they've been rejected by their parents, peers or society in general due to their sexual orientation or gender identity.One measure of how many are affected comes from Lyric. Of the 600 mostly LGBT young people enrolled in Lyric’s programs in San Francisco, 56 percent are homeless or have unstable housing situations and all are low-income.Across California and the nation, thousands of LGBT young people can be found on the street, in shelters or couch surfing with friends or relatives, said Schwartz and other experts.LGBT young people ages 13 to 25 are 120 percent more likely to become homeless than their straight peers, according to a national survey of 26,000 young people released in November by Chapin Hall, a University of Chicago research and policy center. And of the nation’s 1.6 million youth 18 and younger who were homeless at some point last year, 40 percent were LGBT, even though they represent only 7 percent of that youth population overall, according to True Colors Fund, a New York nonprofit that advocates on behalf of homeless LGBT youth.In California, the number of homeless children in K-12 schools overall has jumped 20 percent from 2014-15 to 2016-17, according to data collected by the California Department of Education. Based on questionnaires filed by their families, more than 200,000 young people were living on the streets, in motels, in cars, in shelters or crowded into apartments with other families due to financial hardship.While state data does not identify whether any of these students are LGBT, youth homeless experts said gay students are disproportionately represented. What drives LGBT youth to homelessness “is complicated, nuanced and difficult to classify,” said Barbara Duffield, executive director of SchoolHouse Connection, a youth homelessness policy nonprofit in Washington, D.C.Sometimes LGBT youth are abandoned by their families, or they run away from home because they feel unwelcome or abused after telling their parents they’re gay. And sometimes their sexual identity makes them feel disconnected, which can lead to other contributing factors for homelessness, such as drug abuse, depression, family conflict or chronic absence from school.According to a 2012 study by the True Colors Fund, Palette Fund and Williams Institute at UCLA, 46 percent of LGBT youth who were homeless or at risk of becoming homeless left home because of family rejection due to their sexual orientation or gender identity. Forty-three percent were forced out by their parents because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Thirty-two percent left because of physical, emotional or sexual abuse at home, and 17 percent aged out of the foster system. Neglect, substance abuse, mental illness and lack of affordable housing were among the other reasons LGBT young people became homeless.Nationwide, 25 percent of LGBT teens are thrown out of their homes at some point after coming out to their parents, according to a 2015 True Colors Fund survey of 138 agencies that provide services to LGBT homeless young people. Although that’s less common in urban, gay-friendly areas like San Francisco and Los Angeles, it still happens, Schwartz said.But, she added, it’s not sexual or gender identity alone that leads young people to live on the street or in shelters. It’s a kaleidoscope of factors, she said.“Every young person has a unique set of experiences and realities,” she said. “The more a young person has going on — if they’re poor, homeless, disconnected, feel oppressed because of their race or if they’re LGBT — you’re going to see increased barriers.”Alicia was in the foster care system starting at age 6 months, when Child Protective Services took her from her mother due to neglect. She was in and out of foster care and group homes in the East Bay Area most of her childhood, running away periodically to avoid abusive living situations.When she was about 12 years old she felt she might not be heterosexual, but kept it to herself.“I had to be very calculated about everything, especially about how I presented myself. I wanted to present myself as super tough and not a burden on anyone,” she said. “I didn’t want to give people another reason not to like me. I felt like I could never really be myself…I had to keep my guard up constantly. I felt pretty alone.”After graduating from an alternative high school, Alicia was awarded a scholarship to study at Mills College in Oakland. At the private women’s school, Alicia said she found a ""supportive queer community” and thrived academically, with double majors in history and urban education.But she kept her homelessness a secret. She couch-surfed, slept in cars and occasionally slept in a tent in nearby Emeryville. Because she never felt safe sleeping outdoors at night, she’d work graveyard shifts at stores and restaurants and sleep on park benches, buses or trains during the day — a much safer option, she said, considering that young homeless people, especially girls, are sometimes sexually assaulted or coerced into trading sex for food or money. Homeless people who are LGBT are especially vulnerable because they’re more likely to be victimized and engage in unsafe sex and have a harder time finding a supporting network of peers, according to the True Colors Fund.Alicia studied in the college library and computer laboratory, showered at the school gym and generally took life one day at a time. But by last year, the street life began to wear on her health, both physically and emotionally. When a close friend died, she decided she needed a permanent solution. Living on the street would eventually kill her, she said.She called Covenant House, a youth shelter in Oakland, and after three months on the waiting list was offered a bed. Covenant House is part of a national nonprofit system of youth shelters with several shelters in the Bay Area and Los Angeles. At the Oakland facility, residents can stay up to two years and receive medical and mental health services, job training, help finding permanent housing, links to education, help with financial planning and other services intended to get young people off the streets permanently.Ninety-four percent of Covenant House residents find stable housing and employment once they leave, said Noel Russell, Covenant House development officer.“It works,” she said. “But we just need more beds. We have 100 people on our waiting list and there’s thousands of young people in the Bay Area sleeping on the street every night. … No child chooses that. No child deserves that.”The first thing Covenant House offers new arrivals is sleep and regular meals — two things homeless young people are not in the habit of enjoying. Alicia said she was so accustomed to not sleeping or eating she could barely do either for the first few weeks she was there.But after a while she settled in, and staff suggested that because she enjoyed studying, she should apply to graduate school. She did and was admitted to the UC Berkeley School of Social Welfare, where she is working toward a master’s degree in social work. Her goal: to become a social worker so she can help other homeless young people.While she’s proud she survived and feels confident she’ll eventually find a well-paying job and permanent housing, she feels she missed out on a childhood and suffered unnecessarily for years. She can’t ride a bike, she never learned basic things like how to floss and she often can’t relate to her classmates. When they talk about their favorite Christmas rituals, for example, she remains silent.“Absolutely nothing that happened to me is acceptable, and it shouldn’t happen to anyone else,” she said. “It’s not OK to think a kid can sleep on the street and nothing will happen to them. … We all have a responsibility to do something about it.”This story originally appeared on EdSource.org"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a4ea7171c0000220068ea8e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Non-New Yorkers officially have less than two months to take advantage of the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s pay-as-you-wish admission policy. Tourists will be charged a mandatory entrance fee starting March 1, The Met announced Thursday. The public museum hasn’t charged a mandatory entrance fee for nearly 50 years. Under the updated policy, visitors from outside of New York state will pay what are currently suggested admission prices: $25 for adults, $17 for seniors and $12 for students. Kids under 12 will still get in for free. The museum said New York residents and students from New Jersey and Connecticut will be allowed to follow the current pay-as-you-wish guidance if they can show proof of residence. The change is expected to affect about 31 percent of the Met’s annual visitors, Daniel H. Weiss, the museum’s president and CEO, wrote Thursday in a blog post. Visits to the museum have increased by more than 40 percent over the last eight years, Weiss said ― but the number of guests paying the full suggested admission fee has declined by 73 percent over the last 13 years. “We are now the only major museum in the world that relies exclusively on a pure pay-as-you-wish system or that does not receive the majority of its funding from the government,” he wrote.“What is clear is that our current pay-as-you-wish policy is no longer sufficient to meet the Museum’s daily operational demands,” he added. “Paid admissions represent only 14 percent of our overall revenue, one of the lowest percentages among our New York City peers.”Weiss said the museum considered its role as an educational resource before making its decision. Still, many critics have argued that the Met should keep its current entrance policy. Two of The New York Times’ chief art critics voiced their concerns in an lengthy piece on Thursday.“I’m instinctively suspicious of, and resistant to, ‘carding’ procedures, meaning any admission policy based on presenting personal identification, which is what the Met is asking for from New York State residents who want to keep paying what they wish,” art critic Holland Cotter wrote. “This potentially discriminates against a population of residents who either don’t have legal identification or are reluctant to show the identification they have,” he added. “And it plays directly into the hands of the anti-immigrant sentiment that is now poisoning this country. I cannot remember a time when a museum’s unqualified demonstration of ‘doors open to all’ would carry more positive — I would say necessary — political weight. This is my single biggest reservation about the Met’s admission-by-I.D. policy.”Fellow art critic Roberta Smith agreed, saying she worried that the “Met’s plan is classist, and nativist.” “If libraries started charging entrance fees there would be a great uproar,” she wrote. “We don’t have to pay for access to publicly owned books, and we shouldn’t have to pay to see art in museums whose nonprofit status is supported by our taxes.”It was first reported in April 2017 that the Met was in talks with the city about changing its admission policy. The museum faced a multimillion-dollar budget deficit that was at least partly caused by financial mismanagement. The deficit has gone down, but The New York Times reports that it still hovers around $10 million. "

Rick Scott were among the first to criticize the proposal.,2018-01-04,Fire boats douse the blazing remnants of the Deepwater Horizon rig in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a4e92671c00003b0068ea4d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Trump administration’s plan to open nearly all U.S. waters to oil drilling is already taking heat from an unlikely source: Republicans. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) swiftly released statements on Thursday opposing Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke’s proposal to allow oil and gas companies to drill on the Atlantic coast for the first time since the 1980s. “I urge Secretary Zinke to recognize the Florida Congressional delegation’s bipartisan efforts to maintain and extend the moratorium in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, and remove this area for future planning purposes,” Rubio said. In a tweet, Scott, a close Trump ally, said he “already asked to immediately meet with Secretary Zinke to discuss the concerns I have with this plan and the crucial need to remove Florida from consideration.”Asked during a Thursday call with reporters about opposition from Scott and others with whom the administration typically aligns, Zinke said states and local communities will have a voice in the process.“Governor Scott has been a great governor in Florida,” he said. “This is the beginning, opening up and saying this is what’s available. At the end of the plan, we are going to listen to the voices of communities, all of the stakeholders. So I look forward to having a dialogue with Governor Scott.” He added that the Trump administration is “sensitive to the needs and requirements of Florida” and understands the state relies heavily on tourism.“Our goal certainly isn’t to cross Governor Scott,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on Thursday. “Just because we may differ on issues from time to time doesn’t mean that we can’t still have an incredibly strong and good relationship.”The draft plan calls for making 25 of 26 offshore planning areas ― roughly 90 percent of the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf ― available for lease. (The only areas excluded are marine sanctuaries and the North Aleutian Basin Planning Area in Alaska — which former President George W. Bush set aside for protection with an executive order.)The administration already identified 47 potential lease sales, including 19 off the coast of Alaska and 12 in the Gulf of Mexico, Zinke said. If approved, the plan would be in effect from 2019 to 2024.Disapproval poured in from lawmakers in Florida, a state with a massive tourism industry where climate change is made extraordinarily visible by sea-level rise and fierce storms.“The people of Florida and its leaders have made it clear over and over again,” said Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.), the co-chair of Climate Solutions Caucus. “We do not want drilling near our shores.”Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who introduced a bill last year to abolish the Environmental Protection Agency, tweeted that he was “100 percent opposed.”In his own tweet, Rep. Brian Mast (R-Fla.) called drilling off Florida’s coast “extremely alarming & unacceptable.”“Our voice has been clear from start: we will not tolerate drilling near our coast,” he said.In the sternest statement yet, Rep. Vern Buchanan (R-Fla.) skewered the administration for its plans to include the Gulf of Mexico, where a BP rig lost control of an undersea well in 2010 and spilled 4 million barrels of crude oil. “Not acceptable to include Gulf of Mexico off Florida’s coast!” he tweeted. “Zinke must reject plans to gut safety rules implemented after Deepwater Horizon disaster. Short memory = recipe for disaster.”Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) told The Baltimore Sun he too opposes the move and that “such drilling would create too great a risk.” Rep. Ryan Costello (R-Pa.) said “this decision strikes me as unnecessary at this time.” “We must prioritize being good stewards of the environment,” Costello, who has a 27 percent lifetime score from the League of Conservation Voters, said in a statement.In a statement to the Associated Press, Rep. Tom Rice (R-S.C.) also highlighted the risks associated with drilling off his state’s coast.“While drilling off the coast of South Carolina may have economic benefits, it comes with potential risks,” he said. “I oppose opening up the coast of South Carolina for oil and gas production.”Tom Davis, a Republican member of the South Carolina Senate, told the AP that the Trump administration’s proposal is “horrible public policy” that is “simply not compatible with coastal South Carolina.”In June, 14 House Republicans ― mostly from Florida ― signed a letter opposing the Trump administration’s proposal to allow companies to search for oil and gas by blasting extremely loud air guns on the Atlantic seabed, a process called seismic testing. Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.) told McClatchy in November that he was trying to rally a coalition of Republicans against drilling on the East Coast.On Thursday, Sanford noted that every coastal municipality in South Carolina, as well as more than 140 along the East Coast, have come out against fossil fuel development in Atlantic waters.“Unfortunately, this proposal explicitly ignores local opposition because it is the single largest expansion of offshore drilling activity ever proposed,” he said in a statement. “In the case of the Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf, drilling hasn’t been allowed in over thirty years. I don’t think the arguments in favor of changing this policy are there, particularly when weighed against what most engineers suspect would be at most a four-month supply of oil reserves for our country.”Despite touting the plan as a boon to the administration’s “energy dominance” goals, Zinke struck a conciliatory tone in a call with reporters, insisting “this is a start,” “this process will take months,” and “this is a draft program.” “Nothing is final, and our department is continuing to engage the American people,” he said.This was updated to include statements from Mast, Gaetz and Costello."

The veteran journalist was named political director in March 2017 and oversaw coverage of Donald Trump’s administration. He joined CBS News in 1999 and, after leaving briefly in 2010, was rehired in 2012. “In the last two weeks, accounts of inappropriate behavior by Steve Chaggaris were brought to our attention and were immediately investigated,” a CBS spokesperson said in a statement to HuffPost. “As a result, CBS News has severed ties with Mr. Chaggaris for violating company policy, effective immediately.”CBS, in its own report of Chaggaris’ ouster, reiterated the importance of staffers speaking up about workplace sexual harassment. “In light of recent highly publicized harassment cases, CBS and other big media companies told staffers how important it is to report instances of all types of improper behavior to human resources or managers,” the network said in its report. Chaggaris couldn’t be reached for comment, and his Twitter handle was recently deleted. The firing comes six weeks after Charlie Rose, PBS host and co-anchor of “CBS This Morning,” was fired after accusations of sexual harassment and groping. Other prominent men in media ― including former “Today” show co-host Matt Lauer and MSNBC senior political analyst Mark Halperin ― have recently been fired amid the wave of women speaking up in the #MeToo movement. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the year Chaggaris became CBS’s political director. He took the role in 2017. "
34,MEDIA,How Logan Paul's 'Dead Body' Video Explains The Chain Reaction Economy Of YouTube,Maxwell Strachan,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/logan-paul-you-tube-suicide_us_5a4d5af0e4b06d1621bcfcca,The internet celebrity's post is gone. What's left in its place is just as disturbing.,2018-01-04,A separate Logan Paul-related video hides the footage from the original.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a4d5bd01d000027005c221e.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On Monday, a vlogger uploaded footage to YouTube of what appeared to be the blurred body of a dead man. I don’t mean Logan Paul. Paul is the Vine star turned internet sensation who on Sunday had uploaded the original footage of the body, which he and his video crew had discovered inside Japan’s so-called suicide forest amid their own nervous cackles and bizarre wisecracks. That video had caused righteous and widespread outrage. But this wasn’t that.This was a 10-minute rant titled “Logan Paul Just Ended His Career,” created by a YouTube personality named Kavos. Staring into his webcam, Kavos attacked Paul relentlessly and ruthlessly for the video, calling him “a massive piece of shit” and an “obnoxious, inconsiderate fuck.” (Curious readers can view his whole video on his YouTube page, but we have opted not to embed the video for reasons that will become clear.)“How far is Logan Paul willing to go for some views?” Kavos asked. “You’re literally exploiting a man’s suicide and his death,” he said at another point. Like Paul’s upload, it was a reaction video, this one a reaction to the reaction, through which the internet could embrace its collective anger at Paul’s tasteless response to death ― and it worked. “Logan Paul Just Ended His Career” has received more than 11 million views, or almost double what Paul had garnered on the original video when Kavos decided to create his.“Let me know what you think down below,” Kavos says at the end of his anti-Paul screed. “Please like the video. Share it around ― and let’s expose Logan and the people who think this is right.”Search for Paul’s video on YouTube right now and you won’t find the original. That has been deleted, and Paul has since apologized both in writing and over YouTube. In its place: an ever-growing number of webcam-based reactions to Paul’s actions ― quickly spliced together and often earnest condemnations. To people who didn’t grow up on YouTube, they can look like unappealing wastes of time. But these easy-to-make videos have become the basis of a popular and occasionally profitable corner of the YouTube economy ― a primary reason why so many of them overwhelm YouTube’s search engines at the sound of a trending topic. “This is the first video I’ve seen of you but I agree with everything you said. I like how you analyze everything, you have a new subscriber,” one commenter wrote to another anti-Paul vlogger.This is how the YouTube economy works. Reactions are the stock-in-trade, subscribers and views the coin of the realm ― so much so that a comedy duo reportedly tried to trademark the term “react” last year. One of the earliest versions of the form came back in 2007 in response to a porn trailer unofficially titled “2 Girls 1 Cup,” which, if you haven’t heard of it before, I will not be explaining. “The resulting videos were like a social periscope,” Sam Anderson later wrote in The New York Times. “They allowed people to watch this taboo thing by proxy, to experience its dangerous thrill without having to encounter it directly.”These reaction videos, psychologists say, allow us to fill up on one of the most basic of human emotions: empathy. “When you watch someone react to something with a big response, it’s much easier to empathize with them because you know exactly what they’re feeling,” a clinical psychologist told Ars Technica last year. That feels good. But over time these vloggers have come to so intimately understand the relationship between empathy and engagement that the form has become exploited ― transformed into something else entirely. Now reaction videos often come not from an innocent bystander watching in horror as Paul treks through the woods for the first time but from a fleet of professionalized vloggers ready and willing to create carefully crafted and well-edited videos they know will resonate with YouTube’s audience, leading, if all goes well, to clicking, button-pressing, engagement and an improved personal brand.Paul’s video became another moment for these vloggers, however earnest, to grow their name by working within the same incentive system that caused Paul’s own horrible decision to walk into the Aokigahara forest for clicks. These vloggers aren’t the problem, however. They are simply working in accordance with the incentives set up for them by the platform Paul himself had used to perfection with videos like “REACTING TO JAKE PAUL’S DISS TRACK AGAINST ME!” and “REACTING TO MYSELF BEFORE I WAS FAMOUS!” for his 15 million-plus subscribers. Select All’s Madison Malone Kircher argues that something like Paul’s reaction video was always going to be the endpoint of YouTube culture, but maybe that’s not quite right. The endpoint was always going to be YouTube reacting to something like Paul’s reaction video. Kavos’ video, however, proved much more successful than any of the other reactions to Paul’s mistake, likely because of one significant difference between his and theirs. Interspersed with the vlogger’s morally sound vitriol was a not insignificant portion of the exact video Kavos was criticizing ― nearly raw footage of Paul and his friends belittling a death.“I need to show this next part of the vlog,” Kavos says. “And it’s a horrible, horrible thing to see, and I’m going to blur it a lot more ― I’m going to blur it way more than Logan did because he didn’t blur it enough. But you get it ― it’s a dead body. Just have a look at what he does.”YouTube explained in a statement about Paul’s original video that graphic footage “can only remain on the site when supported by appropriate educational or documentary information.” That’s no doubt why YouTube has blocked people who have tried to upload the version of Paul’s video full stop, and why at least some of the vloggers opted not to include it (another clear reason: genuine sensitivity). But Kavos walked a fine line, unfurling his disgust while providing the hard-to-find original footage — the disgusting stuff.Wrote one commenter: “From 3k average sub’s a day to 75k yesterday... Good to see Kavos finally getting some decent recognition. Kudos and keep up the good work!” “[S]omeone did bad and time for you to make money.congrats 10M,” another wrote. But others weren’t so impressed, calling Kavos “disgusting” for creating a video that included the footage of a blurred dead body “for the same reason, views.”“What is Youtube coming to,” ask one commenter. “It makes me laugh as soon as someone does something wrong everyone creates a video about it to gain views and subs unbelievable.”The reaction must have not been intense enough to make Kavos think twice, however, or to ignore the golden vlogger rule of “react first, think later.” Because on Wednesday, he returned to YouTube to upload another video. This time he titled it, “Do Not Forgive Logan Paul.”If you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

Kendrick Lamar and label executive Anthony “Top Dawg” Tiffith are curating and producing the film’s soundtrack. “Black Panther: The Album” will feature music from and inspired by Ryan Coogler’s highly anticipated film, Interscope Records announced on Thursday. This is the first time Marvel has integrated multiple original songs created specifically for a movie, according to the press release. “I am honored to be working with such an incredible artist whose work has been so inspirational, and whose artistic themes align with those we explore in the film. I can’t wait for the world to hear what Kendrick and [record label Top Dawg Entertainment] have in store,” Coogler said in a statement.The director hand-picked the “DAMN.” artist ― who appeared on one of the variant covers for Forbes’ most recent “30 Under 30” issue ― for this collaboration.“Marvel Studios’ ‘Black Panther’ is amazing, from its cast to its director,” Lamar said in the press release. “The magnitude of this film showcases a great marriage of art and culture. I’m truly honored to contribute my knowledge of producing sound and writing music alongside Ryan and Marvel’s vision.”“All the Stars,” which features SZA, is the first track off of the album. “Black Panther,” the 18th movie in Marvel’s sprawling film franchise, features an all-star black cast, including Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Angela Bassett, Lupita Nyong’o and Danai Gurira, among others. The movie hits theaters on Feb. 16, which clearly isn’t soon enough. We’ll be bopping along to “All the Stars” until then."

There would also be an emergency provision that would allow a judge to delete content or block access to a website deemed to be propagating fake news. Macron previously accused Russia and its state-owned media companies of spreading fake news in order to interfere with the French presidential campaign. The American intelligence community has also expressed “high confidence” that Russia used a similar “influence campaign” during the 2016 U.S. presidential election to “undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process.”Marine Le Pen, the far-right presidential candidate who was defeated by Macron last year, excoriated the president for his planned fake news ban.France was “muzzling its citizens,” Le Pen said in a series of tweets on Wednesday, adding: “Who will decide if a piece of news is fake? Judges? The government?”Macron’s announcement came just days after Germany began enforcing its new anti-fake news law, the controversial Network Enforcement Act, also known as the NetzDG law. The German law, which took effect Jan. 1 after a grace period, requires all internet platforms with more than 2 million users to implement a system for reporting and scrubbing potentially illicit content, including fake news and hate speech.

It expected more frequent extreme events in future.“We have a new normal,” said Ernst Rauch, head of Munich Re’s Corporate Climate Center, which monitors climate change risks.“2017 was not an outlier,” he said, noting insured losses have surpassed $100 billion multiple times since 2005. “We must have on our radar the trend of new magnitudes.”Last year’s hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria in the United States and Caribbean, wildfires in California and earthquakes in Mexico destroyed homes, infrastructure and numerous lives.The disasters also rocked global insurers. Munich Re and Hannover Re both issued profit warnings.That dealt a blow to a sector already struggling with thin margins, stiff competition and falling prices.Munich Re’s tally for the industry comes on the back of other estimates that underscored the severity of 2017.In December, Swiss Re estimated global insured losses from catastrophes would hit $136 billion in 2017, the third-highest on record for the sector, with the United States hardest hit. That figure is not directly comparable to Munich Re’s estimates as it includes man-made disasters.Reinsurers, which are in the business of insuring insurance, are experts in managing risk and rarely get caught off guard. Analysts have said reinsurers may need to take a fresh look at their risk models as the planet warms and storms become more intense.A big question for the industry has been whether the run of catastrophes would allow them to achieve higher prices for their coverage, which have been in decline for years.Early indications suggest modest increases. Global property reinsurance prices rose less than expected in the key Jan. 1 renewal season, with strong competition limiting increases to single digit percentages, brokers said this week.A turnaround in prices would be the first major reversal since Hurricane Katrina in 2005."

Hannah-Beth Jackson and Assemblymember Monique Limón, both Democrats representing Santa Barbara, follows a series of destructive blazes that hit California last year. The Thomas fire, which burned more than 270,000 acres in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties, was the largest recorded blaze in state history.Jackson and Limón aim to address the shortcomings of an emergency alert system meant to forewarn residents of an approaching fire. The lawmakers also seek to improve emergency communications with non-English-speaking residents and to reduce the wildfire risk as new developments are built.With climate change exacerbating extreme weather patterns in California ― including the kind of high temperatures and long periods of drought that create ideal conditions for wildfires ― Jackson said in a statement that the state must fortify its emergency alert system.“Recent California wildfires have driven home how important it is that we have a way to notify people quickly and effectively, so they can leave burning neighborhoods, check in on loved ones, and make the best choices for their safety at any hour of the day or night,” Jackson said.The state senator plans to push a measure to give individual counties the ability to automatically enroll local residents in an emergency notification program that can focus on smaller areas. That would address two flaws in the state’s current network of public warning systems.Right now, many of those systems require residents to opt in, meaning they don’t receive the alerts if they haven’t signed up for them. This was among the problems identified after the deadly Northern California fires in October, which killed 44 people. Multiple survivors of those 21 blazes later said they felt they were inadequately warned. The federal Wireless Emergency Alert system ― which state officials used to send alerts to some 8 million smartphones when the Southern California fires erupted in December ― doesn’t require residents to opt in. But it also isn’t designed to target specific neighborhoods that may be more at risk than others.When the fires began in Northern California in early October, officials in Sonoma County — where over half of the fatalities occurred — decided not to deploy the WEA system. Because the alerts couldn’t be targeted to particular neighborhoods, officials said they were worried about setting off widespread panic and prompting mass evacuations by people who weren’t in immediate danger.Another bill, which Limón plans to introduce, would require that all communications sent out by state and county emergency services be made available in not just the first but the second most spoken language in that area. Language barriers can undermine emergency efforts, the assemblymember said in a release.“In a dynamic emergency like the Thomas Fire, timing is everything,” Limón said. “Real time translated emergency information is essential to alleviate confusion and ensure the safety of everyone.”A third bill, authored by Jackson, would make it easier for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire, to weigh in on local development plans. The agency’s expertise could help lower the risk of wildfires to new houses and neighborhoods.“Wildfires can strike anywhere in the state,” Cal Fire deputy chief Scott McLean told HuffPost in December. “It’s not ‘if,’ it’s basically ‘when.’ And it’s not gonna stop.”"

MooreSouth Carolina wants to replace aging school buses. Colorado plans to electrify Denver’s bus system. And Washington wants electric ferryboats for Puget Sound.As part of a 2016 federal court settlement after Volkswagen admitted programming its diesel vehicles to cheat on emissions tests, the automaker agreed to pay $2.8 billion to states to be used to reduce diesel pollution. And with money arriving as early as June, states are already deciding how to spend their share of the funds.The infusion of money comes at a time when states are struggling to meet air quality standards and believe they won’t be able to do it without widespread adoption of low- and no-emission vehicles, from the Nissan Leaf in someone’s driveway to propane-fueled city buses and electric freight locomotives in public and corporate fleets. The VW funds — ranging from $8 million to $423 million per state, depending on the number of diesel VWs sold — could jump-start a viable market for alternate-fuel and electric vehicles, clean energy experts and state officials say.“The hidden value of the VW settlement is creating an interest and appetite [among] agencies that might not otherwise have been participating in clean-vehicle technologies,” said Dan Welch of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, a nonprofit that advocates for clean energy.Under the settlement, negotiated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board, states can spend the VW money on grants to both public agencies and private businesses. Each state has named a lead agency — whether environmental, energy or transportation — to oversee the projects, and 11 states (Arkansas, Connecticut, Colorado, Delaware, Maine, Nevada, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Vermont and Washington) have already released draft plans outlining their proposed grants to replace engines that spew nitrogen oxide, or NOx.States can spend as much as 15 percent of their payout to subsidize construction of public charging stations for electric cars. Most states are likely to spend the full amount, said Nick Nigro of Atlas Public Policy, a transportation electrification consulting firm: 17 states have already said they will do so. (Under a separate part of its court settlement, Volkswagen is spending $2 billion to build electric car charging stations and $10 billion to buy back diesel cars from consumers.)Dirty BusesClean-energy advocates say public transit and school buses are likely targets for state programs for diesel replacement. Parents like the idea of getting rid of diesel fumes at the school bus stop. And the VW funds are arriving at a time when transit systems around the country are increasingly trying out electric and hybrid buses.“There’s an enormous amount of public interest on the school bus side,” said Will Toor, transportation program director at the nonprofit Southwest Energy Efficiency Project, a regional advocacy group.In New Mexico, a group of voters rallied in November to demand the state devote its $18 million settlement to zero-emission school buses to protect children with asthma. In South Carolina, the Department of Education wants to use all of the state’s $34 million payout to begin replacing the state’s 5,600 diesel buses, which average more than 15 years old.In July, the Los Angeles Metro public transit system pledged to convert its fleet of 2,200 buses from compressed natural gas to electric power by 2030; the first purchase of 95 electric buses, to be on the road beginning in 2020, will cost $138 million. In Seattle, King County Metro has committed to buy only electric buses after 2020.Still, just over half of the 71,000 transit buses in the U.S. remain diesel-powered, according to the federal Alternative Fuels Data Center.In Colorado, the state’s proposed plan calls for about one-quarter of its payout, or $18 million, to subsidize new electric and compressed natural gas transit buses.“What this [VW settlement] can do is make it easier for more transit agencies to try more electric buses on a greater number of routes, and become familiar with them and see that they really work for them,” Toor said.In California, which has perhaps the nation’s most extensive, and complex, air quality mitigation programs, much of the $423 million in VW settlement money will likely go to existing programs to reduce diesel emissions in neighborhoods near warehouses, industries and seaports, said California Air Resources Board spokesman David Clegern. Those programs include vouchers to offset costs of businesses buying hybrid and zero-emission trucks and buses, and demonstration projects for electrification of forklifts, refrigeration units and yard trucks at freight facilities.While the state has made strides in making cars cleaner, trucks haven’t reached the same standard, Clegern said. “There’s just a lot of trucks there, and a lot of trucks that sit and idle. If you’re at a port and your truck is moving six inches every 30 minutes, you’re putting out a lot of stuff.”Clean Diesel or Zero Emissions?One difference in states’ approach to diesel replacement has already emerged: how hard to push private and public fleet owners to replace old diesel engines with electric, rather than newer “clean” diesel, engines. (VW’s “clean” diesel engines were the ones that got it into trouble.)“There’s a tension in a way between wanting to get the most immediate thing for your buck by going for the low-cost diesel, the newer diesel vehicles, and going all the way to zero emission,” said Max Baumhefner of the Natural Resources Defense Council, an electrification advocate.New diesel vehicles cost less than electric or alternate fuel vehicles, and don’t require charging infrastructure or new fueling stations. But zero-emission vehicles are cheaper and cleaner long-term, said Nigro of Atlas Public Policy. “It’s clearly a lot of work up front. It’s a lot easier to swap out an old diesel bus for a new diesel bus. But that’s not going to move the needle on emissions, particularly NOx emissions.”Colorado, which will receive $69 million from the VW settlement, will only offer subsidies for truck and bus owners to replace old diesel engines with alternate-fuel or electric vehicles. For private businesses, it plans to pay $100,000 toward the cost of a new electric dump truck, or $36,000 for a dump truck powered by propane. For government-owned fleets, subsidies are higher: $200,000 for an electric heavy-duty truck or $50,000 for a propane-powered one. Only small businesses with fewer than nine trucks can apply for reimbursement for replacing old diesel trucks with newer “clean” diesel. In all cases, the old diesel-powered trucks must be scrapped.Connecticut, which is eligible for $56 million, will allow public and private fleet owners to replace old diesel engines with newer, cleaner diesel engines without restriction.“We’re not limiting ourselves in any way shape or form,” said Paul Farrell, assistant director of air planning for Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. “We want to see what the projects are out there.” Connecticut also plans to subsidize new electric vehicles at a higher rate than replacement with new diesel.But proponents of electric transportation say allowing new diesel engines at all is a poor use of mitigation trust money.“If you spend your money on buying new diesel to replace old diesel, five years from now you’ll never know the settlement happened,” Toor said.Electric vehicle technology is evolving quickly with improved reliability and battery life. Electric automaker Tesla, for instance, recently introduced an electric tractor-trailer truck with a 500-mile range and a price tag of $180,000. School bus makers Blue Bird and Thomas Built Buses have both introduced electric models.“If this was five years ago, we wouldn’t even be having this conversation because there weren’t electric options even on the horizon’’ for medium- and heavy-duty trucks, Toor said.The swift evolution of alternate-fuel transportation is partly why Colorado plans to put 18 percent of its settlement money — $12.2 million — in a “flex fund,” to be allocated after it becomes clear which programs will be most successful, said Chris Colclasure, deputy director of the air pollution control division of Colorado’s Department of Public Health and Environment.“We didn’t want to decide everything up front and lock ourselves into spending everything in a certain way,” he said.States’ money from the Volkswagen settlement may be least effective at combating nitrogen oxides from long-haul trucking, a major source in many states. A tractor-trailer heading through Pennsylvania and Ohio on Interstate 80, for instance, may be owned by a company headquartered elsewhere and not eligible to take part in either state’s diesel replacement program.“While significant, the VW money is not enough to tackle all of the sources of diesel pollution out there,” Baumhefner said. “The good news is that there’s still plenty of bad air to go around. There’s no shortage of opportunities here to get dirty diesel off the road.” Stateline home pageSign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research "

But now, unusually cold weather and rising prices could cut into the benefits that reach only 6 million households, just 16 percent of those eligible. “If this is what the rest of the winter’s going to look like, we’re going to have a tough time,” said Mark Wolfe, head of the National Energy Assistance Directors’ Association, a lobbying group for state heating assistance programs. Members of Congress from Massachusetts warned on Thursday of a “home heating crisis” in the Northeast, urging the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to release additional Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program funds.“Families in the Commonwealth will soon confront a home heating emergency as LIHEAP funds are exhausted while extreme cold weather continues to strike the region,” the lawmakers, all Democrats, wrote in their letter. “Families in the Northeast are also facing heating fuel prices that are significantly higher than last winter.”Since the early 1980s, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program has helped millions of households heat their homes in winter and cool them in summer. Partly because of higher fuel costs, Congress boosted the program’s funding to $5 billion for 2009 and 2010, then started paring it back after the Obama administration signaled it was willing to sacrifice social spending to cut deals with Republicans. The program currently gets $3.3 billion.“We had a huge spike in energy prices, and the program doubled to $5 billion,” White House budget director Jack Lew said in 2011. “We’re now at a price level that’s close to where we were before that increase.”Energy prices subsequently increased again, bottomed out in early 2016 and are now on the rise once more, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Several relatively mild winters have alleviated the impact of the higher prices in recent years, but 2018 started out unusually cold across most of the U.S. Wolfe said heating oil price increases will effectively reduce the value of federal assistance for home heating costs from 61 percent two years ago to 52 percent today for households that benefit from the program. While the Obama administration supported cuts to heating assistance, the Trump administration proposed getting rid of it entirely as part of an austere budget last year that took funding from safety net programs and gave it to the military. (Most of the budget was a nonstarter on the Hill.) Trump budget director Mick Mulvaney called heating assistance wasteful and cited a Government Accountability Office report from 2010 that found 9 percent of beneficiary households had incorrect information on their applications, including 11,000 Social Security numbers belonging to dead people. “Eleven thousand dead people got this benefit a few years ago,” Mulvaney told Congress in May. “Dead people!” Wolfe said most of the dead people probably had surviving spouses who legitimately qualified for the program. Mulvaney did not mention that Department of Health and Human Services has implemented each of the Government Accounting Office’s six recommendations for improving the integrity of the program. Keith Wilson of Wendell, Minnesota, said he’d called the Minnesota Department of Commerce to request a heating assistance application on Thursday. His utility costs had increased about $50 per month last year. Wilson said it’s been so cold that a pipe froze and burst in his basement last week. The 61-year-old disabled woodworker faulted himself for not keeping the heat high enough in the basement, but said he’s been scraping by on Social Security Disability Insurance benefits. “I had to take out a loan to get a tooth fixed,” he said.Arthur Delaney co-hosts the HuffPost Politics podcast: "

Jim Jordan (R-Ohio,), left, walks with Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) on Capitol Hill, Dec. 4, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a4e89d51c0000220068ea29.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― One of President Donald Trump’s greatest frustrations during his first year in office has been his hand-picked attorney general recusing himself from a Justice Department investigation into the Trump campaign’s possible collusion with the Russian government. Despite his supposed penchant for firing people, Trump has been unable to bring himself to give Jeff Sessions the boot. But now, with the FBI unwilling to tell Congress what evidence it used to obtain a special warrant to spy on a Trump campaign official, two of Trump’s biggest supporters in Congress are suggesting Sessions ought to step down or be fired.House Freedom Caucus leader Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and former HFC Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) posed a series of questions Thursday ― published in a scornful op-ed in the Washington Examiner ― that ask how the FBI got a surveillance warrant to monitor potential collusion between Russia and Trump campaign official Carter Page, and why the FBI won’t answer their questions.“We in Congress have asked them repeatedly to tell us what was in the application they took to the [Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act] Court to get a warrant for spying on the Trump campaign,” Meadows and Jordan write. “Did they use the dossier in their application?”The “dossier” in question is the memo prepared by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele that makes a number of explosive claims about Trump’s ties to Russia and describes alleged compromising information the Russians may have on the president. Conservatives see the dossier as a faulty opposition research document that shouldn’t have been used to secure any FISA warrant ― even if at least some of the claims in the dossier have been corroborated, particularly regarding certain meetings between Page and a Russian official.The New York Times published a report last week claiming the FBI mostly used information gleaned by an Australian diplomat who shared a drunken conversation with another Trump campaign official, George Papadopoulos, in May 2016 to secure their FISA warrant.But Meadows and Jordan ask why, if that was the case, the FBI didn’t interview Papadopoulos until January 2017, and why the FISA warrant was centered on Page ― who plays a major role in the Steele dossier ― but not Papadopoulos.“It seems remarkably odd that instead of the FBI answering the critical questions that Congress has repeatedly asked, they instead leak a far-fetched and ill-supported story to the New York Times,” Meadows and Jordan write. “If this is the truth, then give us the documentation we’ve asked for to prove it.”Without actually saying so, the Freedom Caucus leaders go right up to the edge of calling on Sessions to step down. Their letter suggests the need for a new attorney general if Sessions is unable to address their issues immediately.HuffPost reached out to Meadows on Thursday for clarification about whether he and Jordan were saying Sessions should resign or be fired. Meadows said it was time that all relevant documents ― “in unredacted forms” ― be delivered to Congress. “Using an unverified political document, paid for by a Democrat campaign and Democrat Party to justify spying on an American citizen, sets a terrible precedent and is not in keeping with the original intent of the FISA program.”Congress is currently struggling to reauthorize certain sections of the FISA program, but is expected to come to an agreement later this month by having hawkish Republicans team up with some Democrats to renew controversial surveillance programs.Meadows and Jordan complain that the FBI won’t share what it used to obtain a FISA warrant on Page. But former Department of Justice spokesman Matt Milller ― now a partner at the management consulting firm Vianovo ― told HuffPost it would be highly unusual for the FBI or DOJ to share that sort of information with Congress, particularly if the investigation was ongoing and had moved from a counterintelligence investigation to a criminal one.“Bottom-line rule: You don’t share information about a criminal investigation while it’s ongoing,” Miller said.Miller also questioned some of the assumptions Meadows and Jordan make in their op-ed, such as Papadopoulos not being under surveillance, albeit not through a FISA court.“He could have very well been under surveillance,” Miller said. “They have no idea.”Reading the Examiner op-ed, it’s difficult not to question Meadows and Jordan’s motives.They begin the piece by praising Trump’s accomplishments, and they write that “there is no evidence of any collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians.”But we know that at least some Trump campaign officials knew the Russians had thousands of emails that would damage Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. We know people like Donald Trump Jr. sought out information from Russia-connected sources that could hurt Clinton. And there seems to be, at the very least, some sketchy financial dealings with people like onetime Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort. To suggest the ongoing investigations are without merit isn’t exactly truthful.There’s also the matter of why conservatives see the need to run interference for Trump on Russia, particularly as they seek a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton and other government dealings during the 2016 campaign.But they may at least have a point about the Justice Department refusing to show Congress the documents that the FBI used to obtain a FISA warrant. And they may yet be proven right that the Steele dossier played more of a role in getting that warrant than certain leaks have suggested ― though that doesn’t necessarily mean the FBI was wrong to watch a Trump campaign official who was meeting with Russians.Either way, Meadows and Jordan want more information.“If Sessions can’t address this issue immediately, then we have one final question needing an answer: When is it time for a new attorney general?” Meadows and Jordan wrote Thursday. “Sadly, it seems the answer is now.”"

On Thursday afternoon, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke announced plans to open virtually all U.S. waters to drilling, include huge swaths of the Arctic, Atlantic and Pacific oceans. On the opposite side of the Atlantic, a Norwegian court ruled against environmentalists who sued to block the oil-rich Scandinavian nation from allowing Arctic drilling.The Trump administration’s decision could have much farther-reaching consequences. The draft plan, released Thursday, makes roughly 90 percent of the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf available for leasing. The Interior Department already identified 47 potential lease sales, including 19 off Alaska’s coast and 12 in the Gulf of Mexico, Zinke said in a call with reporters. The five-year plan opens the Atlantic to drilling for the first time since the 1980s, drawing criticism from even hardline Republicans, including Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R). Yet the decision marked a clear win for the oil and gas industry, which began pushing its lengthy wishlist to the administration the weeks after Trump won in November 2016. The American Petroleum Institute, the industry’s main lobby, said the announcement put the country “on the right track towards increased energy production, economic growth, and job creation.”“This new offshore leasing plan is an important step towards harnessing our nation’s energy potential for the benefit of American energy consumers,” Erik Milito, API’s upstream director, said in a statement. “The ability to safely and responsibly access and explore our resources in the Arctic, Atlantic, Pacific and the Eastern Gulf of Mexico is a critical part of advancing the long-term energy security of the U.S.”The Interior Department did not take questions from HuffPost during the call, and did not respond to an email asking whether its officials had calculated the impact the increased drilling would have on climate change and sea-level rise.But the announcement, buttressed by the Norwegian ruling, comes as an unusual cold snap culminated with a monster storm blanketing states from Maine to north Florida with snow. The hurricane-like storm, called a “bomb cyclone,” occurs when hot and cold temperatures collide over water and cause pressure to drop rapidly, at a rate of 1 millibar per hour, over a 24-hour period. It’s difficult to draw a straight line between an individual weather event and the warming climate. But a study released in September found a growing number of extreme cold fronts hitting northern regions as the Arctic heats up at a rate twice as fast as the rest of Earth. That may seem counterintuitive, but the researchers argued that the rising temperatures cause a chain reaction. With less sea ice, the ocean releases more energy. That heat escapes into the atmosphere and weakens the polar vortex winds that swirl over the Arctic and normally keep cold air contained to the region. That weakening allows the frigid air to slip southward more frequently. “These cold air masses, when they travel over warming waters, the possibility, the probability, of more of these explosively developing cyclones, particularly in populated coastal areas are going to get much more severe,” John Gyakum, the McGill University meteorology professor who helped coin the term “bomb cyclone” in 1980, told HuffPost on Wednesday.

The news comes a month after Netflix fired him from “The Ranch.” Masterson co-starred in and co-produced the show with actor Ashton Kutcher, whom he previously starred alongside on the sitcom “That ’70s Show.”In response to a request for comment, the agency, which has represented the actor for 20 years, said, “UTA no longer represents Danny Masterson.” A source familiar with Masterson’s relationship with UTA said the decision to cut ties was made some time back. HuffPost first learned of the news from a source close to Masterson.The Los Angeles Police Department and Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office have been conducting an investigation into multiple allegations of rape against Masterson for almost a year. Four women have accused Masterson of violently raping them in the early 2000s. Three of the women were members of the Church of Scientology; Masterson is a prominent Scientologist. Masterson has denied all allegations of rape and said the encounters in question were consensual.Masterson was ostensibly fired by Netflix (a network spokesperson said he was written off the show “The Ranch”) after a Netflix executive told one of the women that top company brass did not believe Masterson’s accusers. The executive, Andy Yeatman, revealed the alleged opinion of company executives after the woman asked him why Masterson was allowed to star on one of their shows while facing multiple rape allegations. Yeatman did not know the woman was a Masterson accuser when he told her the victims were not seen as credible. Netflix confirmed at the time of the report that Yeatman made the comments. “Mr. Yeatman’s comments were careless, uninformed and do not represent the views of the company,” the company said. Yeatman was also later fired by Netflix. "

Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bomb-cyclone-definition_us_5a4d5beae4b06d1621bcfd56,"Meteorology professor John Gyakum has stopped using the phrase he helped coin in 1980. Still, he has high hopes for its newfound popularity.",2018-01-04,"McGill University meteorology professor John Gyakum, who co-authored the paper that first used the term “bomb cyclone.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a4d5fec1d00003d005c2227.png?cache=cE6rw58bSv&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The man who helped invent “bomb cyclone” ― the meteorological term used to describe the intense weather system gripping the East Coast right now ― doesn’t use it anymore. McGill University meteorology professor John Gyakum said he avoids analogies to incendiary weapons in an era where terrorist attacks and major weather events both regularly make headlines. “When I talk about these explosively developing storms, I go through the trouble of mouthing the terms ‘explosively developing,’ and I don’t use ‘bomb,’” Gyakum told HuffPost. “It’s somewhat inappropriate when you consider other aspects of the world right now.”But Gyakum, along with the revered late Massachusetts Institute of Technology meteorologist Fred Sanders, first coined the term in a paper they published in 1980. They used the phrase to describe powerful cyclones that get their energy from rapid drops in pressure caused by hot and cold temperatures colliding.The once-obscure piece of meteorological jargon entered the popular lexicon this week as a monster storm, set to pummel the East Coast on Wednesday night into Thursday, formed over the Atlantic Ocean. “Bomb cyclone” surged in popularity after The Washington Post published an article Tuesday afternoon comparing the storm to a winter hurricane, warning that winds could reach 70 mph in some parts of New England. A bomb occurs when an extratropical surface cyclone undergoes “bombogenesis,” meaning the central pressure drops 24 millibars in 24 hours. As pressure decreases, the storm’s strength intensifies. The name describes the topography of a weather map during such a cyclone. In a high-pressure system, the isobar lines are far apart. But when the pressure suddenly plummets in the middle of a cyclone, the lines are close together, indicating a deep depression. Scientists began toying with combining the terms “bomb,” “bombogenesis,” “weather” and “climatological” in the 1940s, according to Earther. However, Mary Cairns, the Glossary of Meteorology’s chief editor, told HuffPost that the term was absent from the first edition of the American Meteorological Society glossary in 1959. Lance Bosart, Sanders’ first Ph.D. student at MIT, said Sanders used the term “bomb” in 1964. “That was the first use I had ever heard of the term,” said Bosart, a professor of atmospheric and environmental science at SUNY Albany. “At the time, I never thought to ask him where it came from. But the term was confined to MIT. When you went somewhere else, it wasn’t used.”Sanders, who died in 2006 at age 83, was a giant of synoptic meteorology ― a field that specializes in large-scale weather events, such as cyclones, fronts and jetstreams ― and is now considered the father of the term “bomb cyclone.” In September 1976, Sanders and Gyakum, a student at the time, began a three-year study on the process of bombogenesis. They were building on the work of Tor Bergeron, a Swedish meteorologist who in the 1930s theorized how precipitation forms in clouds. Sanders and Gyakum published their research under the title “Synoptic-Dynamic Climatology of the ‘Bomb’” in March 1980. The widely cited paper catapulted “bomb” into mainstream meteorology. When the American Meteorological Society updated its glossary in 2000, the term made the cut because it was so commonly used by scientists, professors and National Weather Service officials. Although he avoids using the term himself, Gyakum, 64, said he hopes its newfound popularity will raise awareness about the dangers of bomb cyclones.“A lot of focus in coastal areas is on hurricanes in the summertime,” he said. “A lot of time during winter, people say it’s easy, the season is over, we don’t have to worry about hurricane-force winds. But a place like Hilton Head, South Carolina, which had been threatened earlier this year and impacted by a few hurricanes, is particularly prone today to the effects of an explosively developing cyclone.”The number of bomb cyclones varies from year to year. About 40 such events can occur off the northern Atlantic and Pacific coasts each year, according to the National Weather Service. But climate change threatens to make them stronger and more frequent.Despite the planet warming overall, northern regions have been hit with a growing number of extreme cold snaps over the past four decades, according to research published last September in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society. Scientists believe that is because the Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet, and reduced sea ice in the region is allowing the ocean to release more energy. The heat escaping from the surface water is causing the weakening of polar vortex winds that swirl above the Arctic, which normally keep air contained to the polar region. That, as InsideClimate News noted last year, allows the cold polar air to slip southward more often.“These cold air masses, when they travel over warming waters, the possibility, the probability, of more of these explosively developing cyclones, particularly in populated coastal areas are going to get much more severe,” Gyakum said. In 2014, global sea levels were 2.6 inches above the 1993 average, and continue to rise at a rate of about one-eighth of an inch per year, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That amplifies the destructiveness of bomb cyclones. “Climate change is having a potentially big impact on not only the potential strength of these cyclones but also the impacts along coastal areas,” Gyakum said. “Even an ordinary storm is much more dangerous than it was, say, 50 years ago, simply because ocean levels have risen.” Those effects, he said, require more research. “If the term itself ― ‘bomb’ ― helps to spur more constructive research,” he said, “then I’m happy.” But not everyone agrees the term’s sudden popularity is so harmless. “In terms of trying to convey meteorological features to the general population, putting in words like that could confuse people more, or, for some people, alarm them,” National Weather Service Director Louis Uccellini told HuffPost.“These storms are very dangerous,” he added. “They can cover a large area as they move across the ocean. It’s really important to understand the impacts of these systems.” Another problem is that attention-grabbing phrases often lose their technical meaning when they become part of popular dialogue.“It’s important to understand a bomb cyclone has a very specific meaning,” said Marshall Shepherd, director of the University of Georgia’s atmospheric program and a former president of the American Meteorological Society. “Not all nor’easters, and not even all strong nor’easters or blizzards, are bombs.” The National Weather Service defines a blizzard as a storm containing large amounts of snow with winds of 35 mph and visibilities of less than one-quarter of a mile for at least three hours. Yet “you see people use ‘blizzards’ for every snowstorm,” Shepherd said, noting that same thing has begun to happen with the phrase “polar vortex” ― a technical term that gained widespread prominence in early 2014 when the phenomenon brought record cold temperatures and heavy snowfall across the United States and Canada.Then there’s the peacenik objection to the term “bomb.” In the early 1980s, a meteorology professor in West Germany publicly scolded Sanders for applying the word to science, according to Kerry Emanuel, a professor of atmospheric science at MIT.“Fred’s retort was, ‘If you don’t like that, what about “front”? That’s been around for a long time,’” said Emanuel, Sanders’ close friend and colleague since 1981. Then he laughed. “That opinion was not widely shared.” “Bomb cyclone,” however, appears to be sharing far and wide. “All my social media contacts are asking me about it on Facebook,” said Eric G. Hoffman, a Plymouth State University meteorology professor who co-authored a paper with Sanders in the early 2000s. “It seems to have caught wildfire today.” "

Jordan) captured by BuzzFeed film critic Alison Willmore, who posted the video to Facebook.“First, I want to thank God, because without God, my mama and daddy wouldn’t have put their two uglies together and they wouldn’t have made me,” she told the audience, martini in hand. “That was all God right there. He put two crazy people together to make one awesome crazy person.”Later in her speech, she thanked the critics, and offered them a little advice.“I’m learning a lot about you guys. The only critics I ever known before this was Siskel and Ebert, and then when they passed, I was like, ‘Oh well.’ I ain’t going to lie to you: All my stuff comes from TV. Who’s the new movie critic TV show, is there one? Get it together, y’all.”Haddish also got emotional and thanked every person who has said anything about her, positive or negative.“I appreciate you. I’m glad you see me. Because it’s been so many years nobody saw me,” she said. “You know when you’re a little kid going through the system, you wonder, ‘Does anyone even know I’m alive?’ And to be able to be this example to youth. There are so many people like me that you guys have no clue about. But they coming, ’cause I kicked the fucking door open.”And we thank you for that, Tiff!To see the entire hilarious speech, including a cut scene from “Girls Trip,” watch the video above."

New estimates from the Pew Research Center show that there were about 3.45 million Muslims of all ages living in the U.S. in 2017. Combining data from a 2017 Pew survey of U.S. Muslims and from the Census Bureau, the research center found that Muslims make up about 1.1 percent of America’s total population. Muslims have been part of America’s religious landscape since the country’s founding. The first wave of Muslims arrived in the U.S. as slaves, many of whom were later forcibly converted to Christianity.Pew first began collecting estimates about the size of the country’s Muslim population in 2007. Since then, the religious group appears to have grown at a rate of about 100,000 per year, fueled by high fertility rates and continued migration to the U.S.Pew projects that the Muslim population will grow faster than America’s Jewish population. In early 2017, Pew reported that Jews accounted for about 2 percent of the U.S. adult population. They are currently the second-largest religious group. Pew predicts that by 2040, Muslims will become the second-largest religious group. By 2050, the American Muslim population is projected to reach 8.1 million, or 2.1 percent of all Americans. Despite American Muslims’ fast rate of growth, it is important to note that they will continue to be a religious minority in an overwhelmingly Christian country. Pew’s 2014 landmark Religious Landscape Survey showed that Christians made up a whopping 70.6 percent of the U.S. adult population. On the other hand, non-Christian faiths, including Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus and others, only made up about 5.9 percent. "

When a court reviewed the recount, lawyers for Yancey found a single ballot they believed should have been counted for the Republican, and the court agreed to accept it.That meant the race was officially a tie, which Virginia state law requires to be determined “by lot” ― through such random processes as picking a name out of a hat, drawing straws or flipping a coin. Lawyers for Simonds unsucessfully sought to get a local court to prevent the drawing, and said Simonds should be the election winner because the court that declared the race a tie failed to follow proper recount procedures. The day before the drawing, Simonds asked Yancey to agree to accept its results, but he declined. It’s unclear whether the drawing will be contested. "

In her first public appearance since confirming her pregnancy after months of speculation, the reality TV star stopped by “The Ellen Show” on Thursday and tried to play coy about sister Kylie Jenner expecting a baby of her own.But host Ellen DeGeneres, of course, was having absolutely none of it. She walked away from the encounter with Kardashian fully convinced the Lip Kit mogul sister is, in fact, pregnant and, honestly, we are too.Jenner is expecting her first child with boyfriend Travis Scott, multiple outlets confirmed in September, and is rumored to have a due date sometime in February. But she’s yet to confirm the news herself, and has seemingly gone into hiding, scaling back her social media presence and refusing to appear in public. During a discussion about Kardashian’s pregnancy cravings, DeGeneres tried to pivot to young Jenner’s pregnancy.“Oh I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Kardashian, clearly covering up something, said. Then DeGeneres actually pulled out a phone to try and get the Good American designer to call her sister on the spot, but, alas Kardashian hadn’t memorized any of Jenner’s numbers. “She must be pregnant. There’s too much secrecy around it,” DeGeneres deduced. “Look at your eyes. Y’all, she’s pregnant. I can tell by her eyes.” “I will make a bet right now,” she added. DeGeneres eventually let Kardashian off the hook on Kylie, and got her to spill on names she’s considering for her own baby. Watch another clip of Kardashian below. "

Stampede tension leg oil platform on May 5. The Stampede deepwater oil and gas field is one of the largest undeveloped fields in the Gulf of Mexico, sitting 115 miles south of Fourchon, Louisiana.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a2fe75b1600001f00cf0ba1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has proposed a sweeping new offshore drilling plan aimed at opening huge swaths of the Arctic, Atlantic and Pacific oceans to oil exploration as part of the Trump administration’s plan to transform the United States into a fossil fuel juggernaut.The draft plan released Thursday includes 25 of 26 offshore planning areas and makes available for lease roughly 90 percent of the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf. The administration has identified 47 potential lease sales, including 19 off the coast of Alaska and 12 in the Gulf of Mexico, Zinke told reporters Thursday. “This is the largest number of lease sales ever proposed” for the national offshore leasing program, Zinke said.“This is a clear difference between energy weakness and energy dominance,” he added. “And under President Trump, we are going to have the strongest energy policy and become the strongest energy superpower. We certainly have the assets to do that.” President Donald Trump signed an executive order in April aimed at opening up the now-protected areas. The order instructed the Interior Department to review the current five-year oil and gas leasing program, finalized by the Obama administration in November, and to write new rules for offshore oil and gas drilling under the guise of an “America-First Offshore Energy Strategy.”If approved, the plan would be in effect from 2019 to 2024. It would replace the current leasing program, which runs through 2022 and was approved following an extensive, multiyear review.Zinke stressed that the proposal is the beginning of a process that would allow for public input from states, local communities and congressional delegations. For eight years under the Obama administration, he said, “responsible energy development took a back seat to, in many cases, special interest groups.” Zinke also dismissed environmental concerns, arguing — as he often does — that it is better to produce energy in the U.S. under reasonable regulations than to produce it overseas with none. “It will deepen also our commitment to environmental stewardship because we do it right,” he said.Citing environmental concerns, President Barack Obama’s Interior Department instituted a temporary ban on drilling in the Arctic’s Beaufort and Chukchi seas between 2017 and 2022, thereby limiting offshore drilling to the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska’s Cook Inlet. One month later, Obama used his executive authority to extend permanent protections for large swaths of the Arctic and Atlantic oceans. The permanent withdrawal encompasses the entire U.S. portion of the Chukchi Sea and significant portions of the Beaufort Sea. It also covers 31 canyons in the Atlantic, stretching from New England to the Chesapeake Bay.At the time, an Obama administration official said that “no president has ever acted to reverse an indefinite withdrawal” and that the permanent ban would “stand the test of time.” Trump, however, claimed in April that his order “reverses the previous administration’s Arctic leasing ban.”The Pacific coast has been closed to new oil and gas exploration since the disastrous 1969 oil spill off Santa Barbara, California. Many lawmakers from the Golden State are starkly opposed to new drilling.“The people of California are simply not going to allow it to happen,” Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) told Zinke at a June 22 budget hearing. “In fact, our state wants to remove the existing oil and gas rigs in our waters. We are looking forward to the development of offshore renewable energy. And we’re not happy about backwards steps.”Oil drilling off the Atlantic coast ended in the early 1980s. For years, however, the oil industry has lobbied to increase access to new drilling areas to complement the offshore industry in the Gulf of Mexico. The boom in places like North Dakota has allowed shale oil, an unconventional type of crude extracted from sedimentary rocks, to dominate the U.S. market.Sierra Weaver, a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, a group that led the charge to have Atlantic waters removed from the current five-year leasing plan, said the Trump administration has offered nothing that would justify going through this process again.“The coast has spoken, whether it is at the local level or the state level,” she told HuffPost. “This is going to be the Trump administration’s first opportunity to either listen to what they say and really respect those local interests, or side with the oil industry over local residents.”The only areas excluded from Zinke’s proposal are marine sanctuaries and the North Aleutian Basin Planning Area in Alaska — which former President George W. Bush set aside for protection with an executive order.“We respected that,” Kate MacGregor, the Interior Department’s deputy assistant secretary for land and minerals management, said Thursday. Zinke took only two questions from reporters before MecGregor took over. Questions directed at her were also limited, and no one asked about how the new offshore plan might impact climate or the coastal communities being threatened by rising seas.Companies such as BP ― which was responsible for the catastrophic 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill that devastated Gulf states with pollution ― have pushed even harder this year for offshore drilling, despite its relatively higher costs compared to shale.BP lost control of a well off the Louisiana coast seven years ago, causing the Deepwater Horizon rig to explode and dump about 4 million barrels of crude into the Gulf of Mexico. Eleven workers were killed, and several species of dolphins and sea turtles continue to die in record numbers due to the spill’s lasting effects.Thursday’s announcement comes just days after the Interior Department moved to slash key offshore safety regulations adopted in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon disaster — the largest spill in the nation’s history. The agency’s Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said the move seeks to “reduce certain unnecessary regulatory burdens” and is expected to save companies an estimated $288 million over 10 years.Last month, Interior also abruptly cut off funding for the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine to study offshore drilling in an effort to identify ways to avoid another disaster like Deepwater Horizon.Environmental groups were quick to threaten litigation ahead of Thursday’s announcement. “Our natural heritage is not President Trump’s to plunder, and we will fight this reckless proposal in the courts and on Capitol Hill,” Jamie Rappaport Clark, president and CEO of Defenders of Wildlife, said in a statement.In her own statement, Diane Hoskins, a campaign director at ocean conservation nonprofit Oceana, said that “giving the oil industry unfettered access to our nation’s oceans is a recipe for disaster.”“This plan opens the floodgates to dirty and dangerous offshore drilling, threatening coastal economies that rely on clean and healthy oceans,” she said. Trump’s plan is likely to put him at loggerheads with East Coast Republicans.Florida Gov. Rick Scott pushed back against the administration’s proposal even before there was an official announcement. “I have already asked to immediately meet with Secretary Zinke to discuss the concerns I have with this plan and the crucial need to remove Florida from consideration,” he said in a statement.Fourteen House Republicans, most of whom are from Florida, signed a letter opposing Trump’s proposal in June to allow seismic testing ― repeatedly blasting an extremely loud air gun on the ocean floor to detect oil and gas reserves ― on the Atlantic coast. Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.) told McClatchy in November that he was trying to rally a coalition of Republicans against drilling on the East Coast.They have company.Just hours after Trump signed his executive order in April, California lawmakers announced plans to introduce a bill to protect state waters from expanded drilling. Alaska native and environmental groups sued the administration the following month to block the offshore drilling efforts in the Arctic.In June, the co-chairmen of the national commission on the BP oil spill warned that Trump’s order could set the stage for another catastrophe of similar scale. Former Florida Gov. Bob Graham and William K. Reilly, who led the Environmental Protection Agency under President George H. W. Bush, wrote a New York Times piece in which they criticized the order for allowing energy exploration in “environmentally sensitive” areas and threatening to get rid of safeguards put in place to protect against undersea well blowouts.Plans to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling ― passed last month as part of the GOP tax bill ― have also been met with fierce criticism from environmentalists and former Interior Department officials who call the area “America’s Serengeti.”This article has been updated with additional details about the draft plan, as well as with quotes from Zinke and MacGregor.

54,QUEER VOICES,Viral Video Claims People Can Stop Being Gay If They Pray Hard Enough,Carol Kuruvilla,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/evangelical-gay-conversion-video_us_5a4d2a27e4b0b0e5a7aa7c38,The evangelical Christian charity Anchored North is targeting teens with anti-queer messages.,2018-01-04,"Emily Thomes is a conservative Christian speaker who claims God helped ""save"" her from being gay.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a4d47472100003e005f6f82.jpeg?cache=FgLaA1RWHB&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"An evangelical Christian group is using social media to promote the scientifically discredited and flat-out lethal idea that gay, lesbian, or bisexual people can change their sexual orientation if they pray hard enough. Anchored North, a conservative Christian charity, tells the story of a young woman named Emily Thomes in a video titled “Love is Love.” Thomes says that after studying the Bible and repenting of her sins, she was able to leave her “super wild” life as a lesbian and marry a man.The video appears to be designed to attract the attention of young queer people or teens who are questioning their sexuality. “Love is Love” is a phrase often used to promote acceptance of LGBTQ relationships. Anchored North also used a rainbow flag in the video’s thumbnail, appropriating what has become a unifying symbol of the gay rights movement.The first few moments of the video seem innocent enough ― with scenes of teens dancing to catchy party music and two girls laughing and holding hands while walking down a street. Thomes is presented as a relatable narrator, introducing herself as someone who fell in love with a girl when she was 15 and soon started proudly identifying as gay. But, despite the video’s friendlier packaging, Thomes claims that queer people can change their sexual orientation if they try.“People say to me all the time, ‘I was born this way.’ I say, OK, yeah, me too,’” she says at one point in the video. “You’re not born with right affections. That’s why Jesus had to come. You feeling a desire for sin just proves you need grace like me.”“Even though the world would paint a totally different story about what sexuality is and isn’t, God’s word is clear and he can save and he does and he will,” she adds.Since Anchored North’s video went live on Dec. 28, it has racked up 1.5 million views and is by far the group’s most popular Facebook video. Anchored North is a 501(c)(3) California-based charity that churns out flashy Christian social media content. The group clams they are “next generation evangelists.” They are dedicated to reaching young people where they are ― on social media. In the past, the company has created videos about women recovering from abortion or forgiving their rapists. The kind of “transformation” that Anchored North is promising is often linked to a practice known as gay conversion therapy. This type of counseling attempts to change a person’s sexual orientation to fit heterosexual standards, and is often motivated by religious principles.Gay conversion therapy has been thoroughly discredited by all major mental health associations. The American Psychological Association states that efforts to change sexual orientation through therapy carry “serious potential to harm young people,” since the tactics used often “frame the inability to change one’s sexual orientation as a personal and moral failure.” Lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth are also almost five times more likely to have attempted suicide than their heterosexual peers.Thomes, an “ex-lesbian” Christian speaker, defended the video in a series of Facebook posts over the past few days. On Tuesday, she went so far as to compare queer relationships to everything from domestic violence to murder. She also suggested that queer people are destined for hell.“Should you stop beating your wife even if you really want to continue? YES. Should you not kill someone even if you’re really wanting to go through with it? YES. Should you get clean if you have a drug problem and are destroying yourself and those who love you even if you still like getting high? YES. Should you stop cheating on your spouse even if you like the attention you’re getting from someone else? YES.”“If you are waiting on God to make your flesh no longer what scripture says it’ll always be, you will spend eternity separated from Him,” she added. Anchored North’s views about sexual orientation reflect the views of most white evangelical Protestants, one of the Christian groups least likely to say in polls that homosexuality should be accepted by society. Mainstream evangelicals tend to hold the belief that marriage was defined by God in the Bible and that Christian sexual ethics have changed little over the past 2,000 years.But the tide is turning. Surveys conducted by the Pew Research Center and the Public Religion Research Institute, or PRRI, show that evangelicals are slowly growing more accepting of queer sexuality ― and that this growth is largely driven by millennials. In 2016, PRRI found that a slim majority (51 percent) of young white evangelical Protestants supported same-sex marriage. Amelia Markham, a queer Christian activist for The Reformation Project, told HuffPost that for an increasing number of Christians, affirming queer sexuality isn’t about “following our feelings” and dismissing the authority of the Bible.“Even conservative Bible scholars concede that good Bible interpretation requires considering the historical, physical, and cultural circumstances that the text is written under,” she wrote in an email. “It then follows that, per the tradition established under Jesus in the New Covenant, echoed quite loudly throughout the last two millennia of the church history, new information should lead Christians to new understanding.”“We don’t jettison the text, we dig deeper and allow it to interrogate us, our prejudices, and ... all the ways that we have cut God down so that our boundaries of who is in and who is out can be maintained.”Brandan Robertson, a queer Christian writer and pastor, told HuffPost that for him, Anchored North’s video shows the damaging effects of fear-driven and anti-queer interpretations of Christianity. While he doesn’t doubt Thomes’ story about her past, he strongly opposes the idea that God desires to turn all LGBTQ people straight.“In the video, you see a young woman stricken by fear and confusion, stemming from non-affirming Christian doctrines, and the power that the fear had to drive her to seek to change her lifestyle,” Robertson wrote in an email. “A more robust, Christ-centered Christian theology would lead us to understand that God is all gracious, all merciful, and extends forgiveness and love to absolutely everyone.”“God has created a vast array of human beings, not one of which is identical to another. And in our diversity ― including diversity of sexuality and gender identity ― God’s glory is revealed.”And for young queer evangelicals, who may be among the 1.5 million people who viewed the video online, Robertson has this piece of advice: “God is love, and in God, there is no retributive judgment ― this is the beauty of grace. So feel liberated to explore yourself, your sexuality, and refuse to buy into any narrative of fear or judgment ― it’s not of God,” he said.“More importantly, you are fearfully and wonderfully made in the image of an eternally diverse God, and in your diversity, you most perfectly reflect God’s divinity. Lean into your queerness, lean into that which makes you unique. And as you do, listen intently for the voice of the Holy Spirit speaking over you, [saying] ‘You are my beloved child, with whom I am well pleased.’”"
55,POLITICS,Trump ICE Chief Wants To Prosecute Politicians Who Won't Lock Up More Immigrants,Elise Foley and Roque Planas,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/immigration-ice-sanctuary-policies_us_5a4d6610e4b06d1621bd0682,"Legal experts say the threat won't hold up in court, but it still matters.",2018-01-04,President Donald Trump keeps making the same weak argument about the alleged threat posed by undocumented immigrants.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a4d8f381d00003d005c226d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The Trump administration is considering prosecuting state and local officials for not fully cooperating with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency’s acting director said Tuesday in an escalation of his threats against so-called “sanctuary cities” and the undocumented immigrants who live in them.The Justice Department did not rule out acting on Thomas Homan’s suggestion. An official told HuffPost on Wednesday that the department is working with ICE “to explore any and all potential options” for reining in jurisdictions that limit their assistance with federal deportation efforts.But Homan’s plan is likely unconstitutional, legal experts say. And the acting director’s argument that sanctuary cities are protecting hordes of dangerous criminals isn’t backed up by his agency’s own data. Recent reports from the Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE, show the Trump administration itself is increasingly cracking down on petty offenders, not violent felons.Homan, who is also President Donald Trump’s nominee to permanently lead ICE, laid out his threats during a Fox News interview on Tuesday. He said that ICE would dramatically increase its own enforcement efforts in California in response to the state’s new law limiting police cooperation with immigration officers and that the federal government should consider lawsuits and funding cutbacks against jurisdictions that pursue sanctuary policies. Public officials should be held “personally accountable” and criminally prosecuted under a law against harboring unauthorized immigrants, he said.ICE did not respond to a request for more information on who Homan thinks should be prosecuted.“We’ve got to take these sanctuary cities on, we’ve got to take them to court and we’ve got to start charging some of these politicians with crimes,” Homan told Fox News.“California better hold on tight,” he said in the same interview, vowing to send more ICE officers to the state.The big problem with Homan’s lawsuit plan is that there are no grounds for criminal prosecution of public officials in these situations, according to several legal experts. Laws merely limiting cooperation with ICE don’t amount to illegal harboring of undocumented immigrants, said Thomas Saenz, president and general counsel of MALDEF, a Latino civil rights organization that fought anti-sanctuary city legislation in Texas. Besides, criminal prosecution requires personal involvement in wrongdoing, he added.The way to hold public officials personally accountable in a democracy is by regularly scheduled elections or recall votes, both of which are options in California, Saenz argued.Criminal prosecution of local officials who don’t, say, hold undocumented immigrants until federal authorities arrive would also run right into the 10th Amendment, which prevents the federal government from forcing state and local authorities to use their resources to enforce federal law ― something that has been used to block past Trump efforts against sanctuary policies.″No matter how much the federal government may not like that, unless they’re to seek a repeal of the 10th Amendment, Homan should shut up and get out of town because he has no legitimacy in the position he currently occupies, having engaged in threats that are more akin to a totalitarian thug than to our government,” Saenz said.Using the threat of prosecution or an actual prosecution to retaliate against officials who have spoken out against the Trump administration would also be a “very serious infringement” of those officials’ First Amendment rights, said Cecillia Wang, deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union.Wang called Homan’s comments an “extension of the tactics of the Trump administration ... who have tried to smear immigrants as criminals.”“State and local officials who have for various policy reasons decided not to participate in the Trump administration’s deportation tactics are also now being smeared by the Trump administration as criminals,” she said. “It’s really a gross abuse of the federal government’s power.”As for Homan’s insistence on Tuesday that “more citizens are going to die” if places like California adopt sanctuary policies, he was echoing comments that Trump has made ever since the 2016 campaign. But there isn’t much data available to support that assertion. The violent crime rate in California plummeted from 1,045 per 100,000 in 1990 to less than half of that by 2014, according to the FBI’s most recent Uniform Crime Report ― that’s during a period in which the state’s undocumented population grew two-thirds larger.Recent Homeland Security reports indicate that the Trump administration is spending more resources on processing higher numbers of petty cases against undocumented immigrants, while casting aside Obama-era guidelines that focused on the much smaller number of individuals who were potential public security threats or had been deported before.Some 17 percent of people deported after being arrested by ICE last fiscal year in the interior of the country ― in other words, not those caught at the border ― had no criminal convictions. (The fiscal year ran from Oct. 1, 2016, to Sept. 30, 2017.) That’s a sharp increase over the 8 percent figure registered in the previous fiscal year. Of those who did have convictions, driving under the influence, “dangerous drugs,” immigration violations and traffic violations were the most common.A week after taking office, Trump ordered the departments of Justice and Homeland Security to compile quarterly reports showing how many immigrants were locked up on federal criminal charges. The latest report, released last month, said 94 percent of the 37,557 confirmed immigrants in federal criminal custody were undocumented.But most of the undocumented immigrants held in federal prisons and pretrial detention are facing prosecution for crossing the border illegally rather than any violent crime, according to data from the U.S. Sentencing Commission. Two-thirds of the non-citizens in federal custody in 2015 were imprisoned on an immigration charge, the commission’s report says. Immigration offenses accounted for nearly one-third of federal prosecutions, with about 20,711 cases. Even those lopsided numbers don’t capture the full picture. The Sentencing Commission’s numbers only include cases processed through the U.S. district courts proper. But most criminal immigration cases are handled by U.S. magistrate judges, who can adjudicate misdemeanor matters. It’s hard to be 100 percent sure without specific data, but it is overwhelmingly likely that the vast majority of undocumented immigrants locked up on federal criminal charges are prosecuted for immigration violations, said Cesar Cuatémoc García Hernández, a law professor at the University of Denver.“It flies in the face of logic that simply being in the United States without the federal government’s permission is inherently endangering anyone,” García told HuffPost. “Not every crime is the same, just as jaywalking is not the same as murder. Just because someone is convicted of a federal crime does not mean that they are a danger to the public.”Finally, although Homan and other Trump administration officials often describe sanctuary policies as if they fully cut off local law enforcement’s cooperation with ICE, most such jurisdictions in reality continue to share certain information with the agency and even hold individuals in particular situations, such as when the federal government provides a warrant or the person has been convicted of more serious crimes. California’s new law, for example, allows more extensive cooperation with ICE in cases involving about 800 criminal offenses.In other words, in most cases involving dangerous criminals, sanctuary jurisdictions don’t limit their cooperation with ICE. What the policies do is restrict local authorities’ participation in enforcing immigration law against people charged with lesser crimes or not charged at all. Supporters argue that this allows police to work better with immigrant communities. They also point to legal and financial concerns: It costs money to hold people on ICE’s behest, and if local officials do so without a warrant, they can be and have been sued.By threatening to prosecute local officials, the Trump administration is essentially trying to force them to abandon their own judgment about what is best for their communities, García said.“Once you start threatening elected officials with jail because of the positions they take as public officials, you’re engaging in fear-mongering,” García argued. “You’re trying to scare them away from taking public positions they feel they ought to take. ... It’s beyond the pale for a high-ranking official of the executive branch of the U.S. government to believe it’s appropriate to prosecute a political opponent.”"
56,POLITICS,Trump ICE Chief Wants To Prosecute Politicians Who Won't Lock Up More Immigrants,Elise Foley and Roque Planas,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/immigration-ice-sanctuary-policies_us_5a4d6610e4b06d1621bd0682,"Legal experts say the threat won't hold up in court, but it still matters.",2018-01-04,President Donald Trump has nominated Acting Director Thomas Homan to run Immigration and Customs Enforcement.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a4d664c1c0000220068e755.jpeg?cache=rOVyxKH3qR&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The Trump administration is considering prosecuting state and local officials for not fully cooperating with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency’s acting director said Tuesday in an escalation of his threats against so-called “sanctuary cities” and the undocumented immigrants who live in them.The Justice Department did not rule out acting on Thomas Homan’s suggestion. An official told HuffPost on Wednesday that the department is working with ICE “to explore any and all potential options” for reining in jurisdictions that limit their assistance with federal deportation efforts.But Homan’s plan is likely unconstitutional, legal experts say. And the acting director’s argument that sanctuary cities are protecting hordes of dangerous criminals isn’t backed up by his agency’s own data. Recent reports from the Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE, show the Trump administration itself is increasingly cracking down on petty offenders, not violent felons.Homan, who is also President Donald Trump’s nominee to permanently lead ICE, laid out his threats during a Fox News interview on Tuesday. He said that ICE would dramatically increase its own enforcement efforts in California in response to the state’s new law limiting police cooperation with immigration officers and that the federal government should consider lawsuits and funding cutbacks against jurisdictions that pursue sanctuary policies. Public officials should be held “personally accountable” and criminally prosecuted under a law against harboring unauthorized immigrants, he said.ICE did not respond to a request for more information on who Homan thinks should be prosecuted.“We’ve got to take these sanctuary cities on, we’ve got to take them to court and we’ve got to start charging some of these politicians with crimes,” Homan told Fox News.“California better hold on tight,” he said in the same interview, vowing to send more ICE officers to the state.The big problem with Homan’s lawsuit plan is that there are no grounds for criminal prosecution of public officials in these situations, according to several legal experts. Laws merely limiting cooperation with ICE don’t amount to illegal harboring of undocumented immigrants, said Thomas Saenz, president and general counsel of MALDEF, a Latino civil rights organization that fought anti-sanctuary city legislation in Texas. Besides, criminal prosecution requires personal involvement in wrongdoing, he added.The way to hold public officials personally accountable in a democracy is by regularly scheduled elections or recall votes, both of which are options in California, Saenz argued.Criminal prosecution of local officials who don’t, say, hold undocumented immigrants until federal authorities arrive would also run right into the 10th Amendment, which prevents the federal government from forcing state and local authorities to use their resources to enforce federal law ― something that has been used to block past Trump efforts against sanctuary policies.″No matter how much the federal government may not like that, unless they’re to seek a repeal of the 10th Amendment, Homan should shut up and get out of town because he has no legitimacy in the position he currently occupies, having engaged in threats that are more akin to a totalitarian thug than to our government,” Saenz said.Using the threat of prosecution or an actual prosecution to retaliate against officials who have spoken out against the Trump administration would also be a “very serious infringement” of those officials’ First Amendment rights, said Cecillia Wang, deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union.Wang called Homan’s comments an “extension of the tactics of the Trump administration ... who have tried to smear immigrants as criminals.”“State and local officials who have for various policy reasons decided not to participate in the Trump administration’s deportation tactics are also now being smeared by the Trump administration as criminals,” she said. “It’s really a gross abuse of the federal government’s power.”As for Homan’s insistence on Tuesday that “more citizens are going to die” if places like California adopt sanctuary policies, he was echoing comments that Trump has made ever since the 2016 campaign. But there isn’t much data available to support that assertion. The violent crime rate in California plummeted from 1,045 per 100,000 in 1990 to less than half of that by 2014, according to the FBI’s most recent Uniform Crime Report ― that’s during a period in which the state’s undocumented population grew two-thirds larger.Recent Homeland Security reports indicate that the Trump administration is spending more resources on processing higher numbers of petty cases against undocumented immigrants, while casting aside Obama-era guidelines that focused on the much smaller number of individuals who were potential public security threats or had been deported before.Some 17 percent of people deported after being arrested by ICE last fiscal year in the interior of the country ― in other words, not those caught at the border ― had no criminal convictions. (The fiscal year ran from Oct. 1, 2016, to Sept. 30, 2017.) That’s a sharp increase over the 8 percent figure registered in the previous fiscal year. Of those who did have convictions, driving under the influence, “dangerous drugs,” immigration violations and traffic violations were the most common.A week after taking office, Trump ordered the departments of Justice and Homeland Security to compile quarterly reports showing how many immigrants were locked up on federal criminal charges. The latest report, released last month, said 94 percent of the 37,557 confirmed immigrants in federal criminal custody were undocumented.But most of the undocumented immigrants held in federal prisons and pretrial detention are facing prosecution for crossing the border illegally rather than any violent crime, according to data from the U.S. Sentencing Commission. Two-thirds of the non-citizens in federal custody in 2015 were imprisoned on an immigration charge, the commission’s report says. Immigration offenses accounted for nearly one-third of federal prosecutions, with about 20,711 cases. Even those lopsided numbers don’t capture the full picture. The Sentencing Commission’s numbers only include cases processed through the U.S. district courts proper. But most criminal immigration cases are handled by U.S. magistrate judges, who can adjudicate misdemeanor matters. It’s hard to be 100 percent sure without specific data, but it is overwhelmingly likely that the vast majority of undocumented immigrants locked up on federal criminal charges are prosecuted for immigration violations, said Cesar Cuatémoc García Hernández, a law professor at the University of Denver.“It flies in the face of logic that simply being in the United States without the federal government’s permission is inherently endangering anyone,” García told HuffPost. “Not every crime is the same, just as jaywalking is not the same as murder.

But the school recently received complaints from local parents and the American Humanist Association, an advocacy organization for nontheists.Monica Miller, senior counsel at the AHA’s legal arm, said assisting the Gideons in distributing Bibles represents a clear breach by the school of the Constitution’s establishment clause.“Anyone, religious or not, can see that the purpose of this is to promote Christianity,” Miller said in a statement.The Gideons International is a Christian organization commonly known for placing free Bibles in hotel and hospital rooms. The group has run into legal challenges numerous times as a result of its efforts to distribute Bibles to children in public schools during school hours. The latest Bible giveaway at Herington Elementary School took place right before students took their winter break. The books were reportedly placed on a table in a common hallway. A sign placed nearby invited fifth-graders to take the Bibles for free.Superintendent Ron Wilson told HuffPost that a Gideons representative placed the sign in the hallway. “The practice of making Gideon Bibles available to 5th Grade Students has been in place for a long time,” Wilson wrote in an email. “Our current principal who was a teacher before becoming principal has said that it is been a practice ever since she’s been there at the school.”Concerned parents reportedly contacted the American Humanist Association, which sent a letter to Herington Schools officials threatening litigation if the practice didn’t come to an end. Wilson told HuffPost that “our intent was never to impose our beliefs on anyone, but rather we were just the sustaining a practice that [had] been in place for a long time.”In the future, the school will no longer allow the distribution of religious materials “in order to respect everyone’s rights and to follow recent court rulings,” Wilson wrote."

Justin C. Mann and James W. White of Schenectady, New York, were charged with first-degree murder and four counts of second-degree murder, Troy police Capt. Daniel DeWolf told CNN. Mann, 24, and White, 38, pleaded not guilty during arraignments Dec. 30. Preliminary hearings are set for Thursday. The men allegedly bound and killed Shanta Myers, 36, her partner Brandi Mells, 22, and Myers’ children, 5-year-old Shanise Myers and 11-year-old Jeremiah Myers, in an apartment in Troy, New York, just north of Albany. The victims’ throats had been slit, the Albany Times Union reported.The victims were slain around 9 p.m. on Dec. 21, according to the Times Union. Their bodies were discovered Dec. 26 by the apartment property manager, who had been contacted by the mother of one of the victims after she couldn’t reach her daughter over Christmas. Myers and Mells reportedly had gotten engaged last year. At a Dec. 30 news conference, Police Chief John Tedesco said one of the suspects knew one of the victims, but he did not elaborate. No additional arrests were expected. “I don’t have to tell you what a good feeling it is to have these two in custody. It’s a great relief,” Tedesco told the Times Union. He did not say whether investigators had determined a motive. “The investigation is still ongoing,” the chief said, “and that’s one of the things that we’re looking for.” Rensselaer County District Attorney Joel Abelove, who was also present at the news conference, offered similar sentiments. “The savagery and barbarism of what happened to these people has been well-reported on by now,” Abelove said. “Our hearts go out to the victims and their families. They’ve suffered an unspeakable loss, they’re trying to gets their heads around; as is most of the public.”The killings stunned the community, the Rev. Jackie Robinson Sr. of the Oak Grove Baptist Church in Troy, told CNN earlier. “The entire city is really traumatized by what has happened,” he said. “It’s inconceivable.” White was convicted of manslaughter in a previous case and served time in New York prisons from 2001 to 2010, according to state records cited by CBS. He was described to the Albany Times-Union as “very troubled” by Michael Saccocio, the executive director of the City Mission shelter, where he’d previously sought food and housing. "

Mark Dayton (D) on Tuesday. The former “Saturday Night Live” star said it was “a privilege and an honor” to serve as a senator for Minnesota.“I am grateful to Minnesotans for giving me a chance to serve our state and our nation, and I am proud to have worked on their behalf,” Franken wrote.After Franken announced his decision to resign in December, Dayton said he planned to appoint Smith to fill the seat. Michelle Fischbach, a Republican who currently serves as president of the Minnesota Senate, is slated to replace Smith as lieutenant governor, as dictated by the state’s constitution.“Tina Smith is a person of the highest integrity and ability,” Dayton said in a statement. “There is no one I trust more to assume the responsibilities of this important office. I know that she will be a superb senator, representing the best interests of our state and our citizens.”Smith, 59, has indicated she will seek to hold onto her seat in a November special election. Franken’s term would have expired in January 2021, and the special election will allow Minnesota voters to choose a permanent replacement for the remainder of the term.With Smith’s swearing-in, Minnesota joins New Hampshire, Washington and California as the only U.S. states represented by two female senators.

So, why should global climate change be a Democrat versus Republican issue?The answer to each of these questions is that issues so vital to the health and future of America should never have been partisanized. Nor should Democrats and Republicans be imprisoned by the generalizations that the former are environmentalists and the latter believe that growing the economy is always more important than protecting ecosystems and habitats. There are reasons that those generalizations are not always fair today.First, there are many conservative individuals and organizations who are deeply committed to the environment, and there are Democrats who are not. Second, we have reached a point at which environmental stresses are so severe that the health of the economy itself is threatened, including jobs, entire industries and government budgets.It has never been accurate to think that the economy and environment are disconnected from one another. Agriculture cannot function in sustained drought. Businesses, communities and families cannot function without fresh water. Weather disasters are pushing families into debt and governments into deficit spending. Moreover, the protection and preservation of ecosystems in the United States has itself become a significant source of jobs and GDP. Research shows, in fact, that the benefits of environmental regulations so often opposed by conservatives far exceed their costs.The need for all of us to actively break down political stereotypes came to mind as I read a story this week by E&E reporter Zack Colman. “Environmental groups are at odds about how to treat a growing number of Republicans who are speaking out on climate change,” Colman writes.Examples include the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus in the House of Representatives; 31 of its members are Republicans and 31 are Democrats. Organizations ranging from ConservAmerica to the Evangelical Environmental Network have shown strong commitments to climate action, although for different reasons. Groups like Young Conservatives for Energy Reform focus on clean energy. Senior Republican thought leaders such as Hank Paulson and James Baker of the Climate Leadership Council are pushing for carbon pricing.Colman reports that some environmental leaders are willing to work with conservatives and Republicans like these. Others are skeptical, while others want to see Republicans prove their commitment to climate action. The Sierra Club’s Executive Director Michael Brune says, “When they prove themselves to be reliable and courageous champions for the environment, then (they) would have their shot at earning the Sierra Club’s support.”The initiative I lead ― the Presidential Climate Action Project ― has a bipartisan national advisory committee that includes the leaders of ConservAmerica and the Evangelical Environmental Network (Rob Sisson and the Rev. Mitch Hescox respectively) as well as former environmental leaders who have served under Republican and Democrat presidents. My personal experience has removed any doubts I might have had about the sincerity of conservatives who understand both the potentials and the need to act on climate change.So, how might other conservatives, liberals, Republicans and Democrats increase their confidence that they are allies against global warming? Here are some suggestions:First, all should publicly dismiss and distance themselves from Donald Trump’s absurd claim that climate change is a hoax.Second, all should work for the restoration of the most important climate-action plans put in place by President Obama and systematically revoked or banished to legal limbo by the Trump Administration. Members of the Climate Solutions Caucus should introduce and work tirelessly for passage of an omnibus bill that not only restores many of these plans, but gives them the status of law. This would create greater stability in federal policies, which would encourage more private investment in the technologies necessary to mitigate and adapt to climate change.Third, Republicans and Democrats alike should twist Trump’s arm to abandon his plan to withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement. Trump should restore America’s leadership in fighting climate change with U.S. technologies. Members of the Climate Solutions Caucus should engage Trump in a negotiation over what America’s promise to other countries will be under the Paris accord.Fourth, the Climate Solutions Caucus should agree on a bipartisan approach to carbon pricing and push publicly and relentlessly to pass the legislation to implement it.Fifth, climate advocacy groups should help Republicans frame their commitment to climate action in ways that are consistent with the goals and values of traditionally conservative and faith-based organizations. For example, carbon pricing is a market-based approach to climate action ― an approach that would make many federal regulations unnecessary.Sixth, climate action advocates from both parties should frame next November’s midterm election as the America’s referendum on national, state and local climate action. The Pew Research Center has found that 55 percent of Americans rank the environment as a top policy issue that Trump and Congress should tackle. Only defending the country from terrorist attacks and strengthening the economy ranked higher. National organizations from leaders from both political parties should make clear to the American people that clean energy technologies and climate action are critical to a strong economy and to America’s security from terrorism.Finally, climate-action leaders in both political parties should make clear that they are representing the will of the American people. An Associated Press poll found in August that 70 percent of respondents said that climate change is underway and 61 percent including 43 percent of Republicans said the government needs to tackle it. Even more Republican voters will back climate action when they see their leaders do so, and more Republicans in Congress will feel it’s safer to support climate action after their colleagues have done so.There is no avoiding the fact that this year will be politically charged because of the midterm elections this November. Republicans are intent on maintaining control of Congress and Democrats believe they have a chance to win it back. But this could – and should – be the election year in which our politicians work together on the environmental issues that are so obviously important to the health, welfare, economic security and resilience of our communities and the nation."

The revelations appeared to contradict Trump’s repeated claims that he was unaware his eldest son, as well as his son-in-law Jared Kushner, had met with the Russians.Bannon also dubbed the infamous Trump Tower meeting as “treasonous” and “bad shit,” according to Wolff. The far-right icon mocked Trump Jr. and Kushner for taking the meeting in hopes of acquiring dirt on Hillary Clinton, Trump’s political opponent in the 2016 presidential race, as first revealed by The New York Times in July.“The three senior guys in the campaign thought it was a good idea to meet with a foreign government inside Trump Tower in the conference room on the 25th floor — with no lawyers,” Bannon told Wolff, according to The Guardian, which obtained a copy of the book.“Even if you thought that this was not treasonous, or unpatriotic, or bad shit, and I happen to think it’s all of that, you should have called the FBI immediately,” he added. Bannon predicted special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible collusion between Trump’s 2016 campaign and the Russian government will focus on money laundering. “This is all about money laundering,” Bannon told Wolff. “Mueller chose [senior prosecutor Andrew] Weissmann first and he is a money-laundering guy. Their path to fucking Trump goes right through Paul Manafort, Don Jr and Jared Kushner … It’s as plain as a hair on your face.”Bannon suggested Kushner’s business dealings with German financial juggernaut Deutsche Bank, which has loaned hundreds of millions of dollars to the Kushner family real estate business, would be problematic for the administration.“The Kushner shit is greasy,” Bannon said. “They’re going to go right through that. They’re going to roll those two guys up and say play me or trade me.”Four Trump associates have been indicted in connection to the probe, including former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who also attended the Trump Tower meeting. Manafort was indicted by a grand jury in October on charges of conspiracy and money laundering.“They’re going to crack Don Junior like an egg on national TV,” Bannon said, adding that the White House should reconsider its apparent lack of concern over the Mueller investigation. “They’re sitting on a beach trying to stop a Category Five.”Trump responded to Bannon’s accusations by claiming his former staffer had “lost his mind.”“Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my Presidency,” Trump said in a statement. “Now that he is on his own, Steve is learning that winning isn’t as easy as I make it look.”This article has been updated with Trump’s response to Bannon.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a4cee671c00003b0068e57e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"While responding to allegations that she knew for years that film producer Harvey Weinstein had been accused of sexually assaulting multiple women, actress Meryl Streep argued that her critics should instead focus on the deafening silence from the White House ― particularly that of first lady Melania Trump and of first daughter Ivanka Trump, who is also an adviser to the president. “I don’t want to hear about the silence of me,” Streep said in a New York Times interview published Wednesday. “I want to hear about the silence of Melania Trump. I want to hear from her. She has so much that’s valuable to say. And so does Ivanka. I want her to speak now.” Ivanka Trump has only briefly addressed the issue of sexual harassment, saying in November that it “can never be tolerated.”Streep has been a vocal critic of President Donald Trump ― who himself has been accused of sexual misconduct by more than a dozen women ― and pilloried him in a speech at last year’s Golden Globe Awards.The president, who is prone to attacking his critics on Twitter, was quick to respond. He called Streep “over-rated” and “a Hillary flunky,” referring to her support of his 2016 opponent, Hillary Clinton.The White House did not immediately return a request for comment on Streep’s latest remarks.Last month, a right-wing artist claimed responsibility for hanging up posters in Los Angeles featuring Streep’s face and the words “she knew.”Streep, who worked with Weinstein over the years, told the Times that she stood by her response to the mogul’s downfall and dismissed suggestions that she had previously known about his alleged serial sexual predation. She also said she was surprised to hear that people were criticizing her for not speaking out about the allegations sooner. “I found out about this on a Friday and went home deep into my own life. And then somebody told me that on ‘Morning Joe’ they were screaming that I haven’t responded yet. I don’t have a Twitter thing or ― handle, whatever. And I don’t have Facebook. I really had to think,” Streep told the Times. “Because it really underlined my own sense of cluelessness, and also how evil, deeply evil, and duplicitous, a person he was, yet such a champion of really great work.”“You make movies. You think you know everything about everybody. So much gossip. You don’t know anything. People are so inscrutable on a certain level. And it’s a shock,” she added. “Some of my favorite people have been brought down by this, and he’s not one of them.”Streep is among a number of prominent women in Hollywood who have teamed up for an initiative to combat sexual harassment in the workplace.Read The New York Times’ full interview with Streep and Tom Hanks here."

They continued into Tuesday night with video footage posted on social media showing demonstrators on the streets and riot police deployed in several cities including Ahvaz in the southwest.Hours earlier, Khamenei had accused Iran’s foes of fomenting the protests, some of which have criticized him by name and called for him to step down.The outburst of dissent is the most serious since 2009, when Iranians took to the streets over accusations of vote-rigging in the re-election of then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.Hundreds have been arrested across the sprawling country and a judicial official warned some could face the death penalty.The demonstrations have put pressure on President Hassan Rouhani, who championed a deal struck with world powers in 2015 to curb Iran’s disputed nuclear program in return for the lifting of most international sanctions against Tehran.Many of those protesting are frustrated at what they see as the failure so far of his government to deliver on promises of more jobs and investment as a payoff from the nuclear accord.Rouhani, who has said the demonstrators have a right to protest, told Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan in a phone call on Wednesday that he hoped the unrest would end in a few days.“We are certain about Iran’s security and stability ... People are free in Iran to protest within the framework of law,” Rouhani was quoted as saying by the state news agency IRNA.TOUGH CHOICE ON SANCTIONSU.S. President Donald Trump has asserted in tweets that Iranians have lost patience with alleged corruption and what he called a terrorist regime.The six days of demonstrations in a string of Iranian cities began over economic conditions, and Trump must decide by mid-January whether to continue waiving U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil exports under the terms of the nuclear deal that he opposed.If he reimposes sanctions on oil, it could increase the economic pain for Iran’s leaders - but also send the wrong message about U.S. support for Iran’s people, analysts say.Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari, commander of Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards, said on Wednesday, “If the Americans’ sympathy with Iranians were real, they would have not imposed cruel sanctions on the our nation.”Referring to Rouhani’s policy of detente with the West, Jafari told Fars news agency that “friendship with the United States” would never bring prosperity and that the Guards were ready to help the government overcome economic challenges.ROUHANI UNDER PRESSUREResentment over economic stagnation and alleged graft within the clerical and security hierarchies sparked the protests after Iranians took to social media to vent their outrage.Anger has been building up since last month. Thousands of Iranians joined a hashtag campaign on Twitter and other sites to express frustration over the slow pace of reforms.Under the ”#I am regretful” hashtag, they expressed disappointment with Rouhani, who was elected on promises of tackling high unemployment and granting more social freedoms.They focused on Rouhani’s latest budget bill. It has allocated, as usual, billions of dollars to religious universities and institutions while the government said it did not have enough cash to help the unemployed, including 28.8 percent of youth who are jobless.Both the arch-conservative Khamenei and the pragmatist Rouhani have pledged to curb corruption and create economic prosperity for all Iranians.But there have been few changes. The elite Revolutionary Guards, for example, still control a vast economic empire.While more than 20 million out of 80 million Iranians live below the poverty line, the wealthy, including relatives of government officials, import tens of thousands of luxury cars every year, causing widespread resentment.While young, impoverished Iranians have dominated the current protests across the Islamic Republic, some members of the urban middle class are also taking part.The demonstrations have evolved into rare political rallies that call for the overthrow of all Iranian leaders.In an attempt to control the flow of information and calls for anti-government gatherings, Tehran authorities have restricted access to the Telegram messaging app and Instagram, owned by Facebook Inc.(Reporting by Bozorgmehr Sharafedin; editing by Michael Georgy and Mark Heinrich)"

The Affordable Care Act doesn’t cover them, and they don’t qualify for Medicaid, Medicare or Social Security. By Teresa WiltzWASHINGTON, D.C. — Early on a recent morning, men huddle in the Home Depot parking lot, ground zero for day laborers on the hunt for work. Cars pull into the lot, and the men swarm.Among them is Marcos, at 65, wiry and bronzed with a silvery smile. He’s been in the country illegally for 20 years, working construction and landscaping, doing whatever he can get, whenever he can get it. When he’s sick, he just rests, because — like most undocumented workers — he doesn’t have insurance.“I don’t know if I have high blood pressure,” he said, laughing ruefully, “Because I don’t check. Doctors, you know, are expensive.”For decades, the United States has struggled to deal with the health care needs of its undocumented immigrants — now an estimated 11 million — mainly through emergency room care and community health centers. But in the coming years, that struggle will evolve. As with the rest of America, the population of people living here illegally is aging and beginning to develop the same health problems that plague senior citizens generally and are a lot more expensive to treat: chronic diseases, cognitive disorders and physical injuries.Many undocumented adults lack health insurance, and even though they’re guaranteed emergency care for acute problems such as heart attacks, senior citizens without documentation don’t have access to care for chronic issues such as kidney disease and high blood pressure. What’s more, experts predict that many will — like Marcos — forgo primary preventive care even when it is available, likely making their chronic health problems worse — and more expensive to treat.“They’re hosed. If you’re an undocumented immigrant, you’re paying into Social Security and Medicare, but can’t claim it,” said Steven Wallace, associate director of the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research.When uninsured people go without preventive health care and end up in the hospital, someone has to pay. Since most of these patients are low-income, much of their bill ends up as bad debt, which then pushes up rates for those who have insurance, or are billed to public programs like Emergency Medicaid, which is paid for out of general taxes.This contributes to a game of shifting costs. Hospitals that don’t cover their costs go bankrupt and close, so indigent care costs that end up as unpaid bills are covered by other payers, such as insurance companies. When insurers pay more, they raise insurance premiums, passing on the costs to consumers, Wallace said.“It’ll place a strain on the entire health care system, from primary care to hospitals,” Wallace said.Growing NumbersApproximately 10 percent of the undocumented population is over 55 now, according to the Migration Policy Institute, but researchers agree that the percentage and the raw numbers almost certainly will rise.“The unauthorized immigrant population has become more settled in recent years, and as a result is aging,” said Mark Hugo Lopez, director of global migration and demography at the Pew Research Center in Washington. (The Pew Charitable Trusts funds both the Pew Research Center and Stateline.)Estimates vary on how many undocumented immigrants lack insurance. The Kaiser Foundation estimates 39 percent of undocumented immigrants are uninsured, while the Migration Policy Institute, which analyzes U.S. Census data, estimates as many as 71 percent of undocumented adults do not have insurance.Like Marcos, older undocumented people tend to be poor. The Affordable Care Act doesn’t cover them, and they don’t qualify for Medicaid, Medicare or Social Security, even though many pay taxes. They can buy private insurance, but few can afford it.That means most must turn to emergency rooms or community health centers, federally funded clinics that provide primary health care to poor people on a sliding scale, regardless of their immigration status. But community health centers were originally created to provide maternity care to women and aren’t equipped to provide extensive care to undocumented seniors, Wallace said. And because Congress has yet to fund them this year, their future is precarious.Leighton Ku, professor and director of the Center for Health Policy Research at George Washington University, said immigrants, both authorized and unauthorized, are much less likely to use health care than are U.S. citizens. This is partly because of language barriers, and partly cultural, Ku said. “They get sick, and grin and bear it.” Until, that is, they’re quite ill.Many also fear running afoul of immigration authorities, health officials say, which means that by the time they get to the doctor, they’re even sicker.“Their numbers are going to grow and we’re going to have an epidemic on our hands,” said Maryland state Del. Joseline Peña-Melnyk, a Democrat whose district has one of the highest rates of undocumented immigrants in the state. “Who’s going to pay for it?”Already, there have been some indications as to who will have to foot the bill. A 2014 report by the Texas Medical Association found that undocumented immigrants with kidney disease face considerable barriers to care. By the time they do get help, they need dialysis, costing Texas taxpayers as much as $10 million a year.Stepping in to HelpMany cities have tried to step in. A 2016 Wall Street Journal story noted that 25 counties with large undocumented populations provide some non-emergency health care to these immigrants, at a combined cost of what the paper estimated is more than $1 billion each year.Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and San Francisco are among the places where immigrants can usually get access to some kind of routine care, no matter their immigration status, thanks to locally funded health care programs.In Los Angeles, Dr. Christina Hillson, a family practice doctor at the Eisner Health Clinic, said she’s seeing a growing number of undocumented patients in their 60s to 80s, whom she’s treated for everything from ovarian cancer to amputations resulting from untreated diabetes.Her clinic is part of My Health LA, a Los Angeles county program that provides free primary care to low-income patients, including some undocumented patients if they qualify.Patients who are critically ill are classified as emergencies and are able to get treated through the hospital system, she said. Sometimes, when patients aren’t as sick, Hillson will still refer them to the ER, because it’s the only way she can get their testing for a potentially deadly illness covered and get them connected to a specialist. She recently had to refer a 68-year-old undocumented patient with rapidly growing breast cancer to the ER, because that’s the only way she would be treated.Snapshot of a PopulationMost undocumented immigrants came to this country as young people and tended to be healthier than native-born citizens, Wallace said. But as they age, they lose that advantage, he said. This may be due to a combination of factors, from poverty to tough working conditions to adapting to American-style bad habits such as increased consumption of junk food and decreased physical activity, he said.Of the country’s aging immigrants living here without documentation, women are more likely to have family in the U.S. who can help care for them as they age, said Randy Capps, a director of research at the Migration Policy Institute. But men, like Marcos, are more likely to be single and without a family support system. Because they often work as manual laborers, they’re more likely to be disabled from on the job injuries, Capps said, a number that’s likely to increase in the coming years.“They’re going to age faster and become disabled at higher rates,” Capps said. “It’s going to make for a much tougher old age.” There’s no one easy solution to helping older residents who live in the United States illegally, health and immigration experts say.“The policy solution for illegals is to enforce the law and encourage them to return home, thereby avoiding the problem,” said Steven Camarota, director of research for the Center for Immigration Studies, a conservative think tank that favors limiting immigration. “If someone wants to sponsor an elderly parent, making sure the sponsor has insurance for them before they come would solve much of the problem.”Joe Caldwell, director of long-term services and supports policy at the National Council on Aging, an advocacy group, said community health centers could possibly provide acute care to undocumented seniors. And federal immigration legislation that provides a pathway to citizenship would put seniors in line to receive Medicare and Medicaid, he said.Such legislation is unlikely any time soon.Outside the Home Depot, Marcos and his friends gather in the cold sunshine, talking animatedly. He’s been paying taxes for years, Marcos said, and he’s got pages of documents to prove it. He’d love to become documented, “but that’s practically impossible,” he said.A year ago, Marcos said, he had tightness in his chest. Could’ve been a pulled muscle, could’ve been a heart attack. He’s vague about the details. Without health insurance, he said, he had no choice but to go to the ER, but he hasn’t followed up since then. He’d rather stalk the parking lot here, looking for work.“No work,” Marcos said, “no money.” Stateline home pageSign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research "

King penguins are able to withstand extremely cold temperatures, but not as well as their cousins, emperor penguins.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a4d04a41d00003d005c20e7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Frigid temperatures in Alberta, Canada, have caused zookeepers to take extra precautions to keep their penguins safe. King penguins at Calgary Zoo are typically able to waddle into their outdoor enclosure as they please. But as temperatures in the region dipped below -13 degrees Fahrenheit, they were moved into their indoor enclosure several times, zoo curator Malu Celli told the Canadian Press. While these king penguins are accustomed to freezing subantarctic climates, they are less hardy than their relatives, emperor penguins. There’s also a young chick in the zoo’s flock, a fact that encouraged zookeepers to be extra cautious over the past few weeks.“It’s kind of like you can bundle up your kid, but then there’s a point you’re going to say, ‘I know you’re good, but I’d rather you stay inside now,’” Celli said.A spokesperson from Calgary Zoo told HuffPost that weather conditions in the area have since improved and the penguins are “happily outdoors again.” It’s not unusual for the zoo to pull its king penguins in from their outdoor enclosure during Calgary’s extreme winter conditions.The zoo’s guidelines suggest that the penguins should be kept indoors if temperatures fall below -25 C (-13 F). Celli told the Canadian Press that temperatures in the region have recently remained around -28 C (-18.4 F). Early Monday morning, the weather in Calgary dipped down to -30 C (-22 F), according to Globalnews.ca. “It’s not necessarily that it’s too cold for them,” Celli said. “I believe that physiologically, they can withstand colder weather than what we have here, but these are not wild birds.”Record-breaking cold temperatures in the United States this week have led some U.S. zoos to prepare to take extra measures to protect their animals too.Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago, which recently had its coldest New Year’s Day on record with a high of 1 degree Fahrenheit, is remaining vigilant. General Curator Dave Bernier told HuffPost that the zoo’s facilities are designed to protect animals even in extremely cold weather. While zookeepers prefer to let animals roam freely between their indoor and outdoor spaces, the staff closely monitors those decisions when temperatures reach these extremes.“We always prefer to give [animals] access to both indoor and outdoor exhibits but will verify that they are making good [decisions] or using the spaces appropriately in extreme weather conditions such as these,” he said. “If there is concern, then they would not be given access to the outdoor space.” The zoo’s African penguins, a temperate species, tend to choose to be indoors most of the time when the temperatures dip into the single digits ― even though the zoo has provided them with heated water outside.John Davis, curator of mammals at South Carolina’s Riverbanks Zoo and Garden told HuffPost that his organization hasn’t needed to take any unusual precautions to ensure the safety of the zoo’s animals. If anything, it’s the human caretakers who are really bearing the brunt of the cold weather. “All of the animals at the zoo are doing well and managing through the southern cold snap,” Davis said. “Staff are the ones enduring most of the discomfort, a testament to their dedication.”“This week, the heaters are running full steam ahead, not so good for the power bill but doing their job in providing the heat to the animals and a brief retreat for the zookeepers to warm themselves in between animal care duties.”CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article attributed quotes about zoo staff staying warm to Dave Bernier of Lincoln Park Zoo. Those statements were from John Davis of Riverbanks Zoo and Garden."

The president also said that a top aide to 2016 election rival Hillary Clinton should be jailed.Holder, who served under then-President Barack Obama, called Trump’s repeated slams of the Justice Department “unfounded.”“When you try to delegitimize a probe, when you try to delegitimize the FBI, that has long-term collateral consequences,” Holder told HuffPost after attending Wednesday’s swearing-in of Alabama’s newest senator, Doug Jones. “I’m disturbed by that, and I’m equally disturbed I’ve seen nothing from this attorney general to defend the people of the Justice Department who are patriots and who do their jobs without any regard to partisan politics. They need to be defended.”Trump has often criticized Sessions for recusing himself from supervising the Russia probe. Last week, the president claimed in a New York Times interview that he has the “absolute right to do what I want to do with the Justice Department.”Holder, meanwhile, has used his platform on Twitter to go after Sessions, who has rolled back several Holder-era initiatives, like his push to reform drug sentencing and his efforts to strengthen the department’s civil rights division. The former attorney general has also criticized GOP lawmakers for pushing voter ID laws and other measures that make it more difficult to vote, an effort he has called “shameful.”Asked Wednesday whether the rule of law in America was under siege in the Trump era, Holder agreed.“Our institutions are strong,” he said. “Our founding documents are strong. But I think we’re seeing a stress test the likes of which we haven’t seen since Watergate.”"

Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R), the panel’s vice chair, said last week that it would meet in January. “Despite substantial evidence of voter fraud, many states have refused to provide the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity with basic information relevant to its inquiry,” the White House said in a statement. “Rather than engage in endless legal battles at taxpayer expense, today I signed an executive order to dissolve the Commission, and have asked the Department of Homeland Security to review these issues and determine next courses of action.”Tyler Houlton, a DHS spokesman, said the agency would continue to work with states on election security and integrity, but said Kobach was not providing advice to the agency.“At the President’s direction, the Department continues to work in support of state governments who are responsible for administering elections, with efforts focused on securing elections against those who seek to undermine the election system or its integrity. Mr. Kobach is not advising the Department on this matter,” he said in a statement.Alan King, a Democrat on the commission, told HuffPost he was surprised to learn from a reporter that the commission had dissolved Wednesday evening.“As someone who has handled 43 elections and who knows election officials across the United States, this is good news,” he said. “I don’t believe there is a conspiracy of voter fraud throughout this nation and never have believed that there was. I was willing to serve on this commission and have an open mind, but I never believed that this commission would be able to produce evidence or testimony to support the claim of a widespread conspiracy of voter fraud in the United States.”Asked what he hoped the commission’s legacy would be, King said, “For future issues that a presidential commission might be impaneled, that more advanced forethought would be put into the decision to study an issue before spending taxpayer money.”The panel had been closely watched and criticized by voting rights advocates, who said it was an effort to substantiate Trump’s claims that there was widespread voter fraud in the 2016 election. Even though several studies and investigations have shown voter fraud is not a widespread issue, critics said the panel would try to stir up uncertainty about fraud in hopes of passing more restrictive voting laws. From the start, the panel faced controversy. Several states refused to comply with a June request from Kobach for voter data from all 50 states. The request sparked widespread privacy concerns, and even Republican election officials said they could not turn over all the information the commission was asking for. As of October, about 20 states had turned over voter information to the commission.White House officials indicated that the panel planned to use the voter data it collected against federal databases to try to identify people illegally on the voting rolls.In one lawsuit, the Brennan Center for Justice sued to get records of commission communications with other federal agencies, such as the Department of Homeland Security, which administers a database of non-citizens and the Department of Justice. The request for those records is still pending. It’s unclear now if those records will become public.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Wednesday that the panel was never intended to uncover fraud.The commission met twice publicly, once in July and once in September, but it was never clear what exactly it was working on. The commission had failed to find, or present any evidence, to substantiate Trump’s claim that 3 million to 5 million people voted illegally in the 2016 presidential election.Democrats on the commission began to raise questions about what exactly the scope of the commission’s activities would be and expressed open frustration about not receiving any information about the commission’s activities between meetings or when meetings would be scheduled. It was sued by Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap, a Democratic commissioner on the panel, who said he was being excluded from communication and planning that kept him from fully participating as a commissioner. A federal judge ruled in December the commission had to turn over documents to Dunlap.American Oversight, the watchdog group that represented Dunlap in his suit, said it would continue to fight for the panel’s communications.“It’s no coincidence that the president dissolved the commission once it became clear it wouldn’t be permitted to operate in the shadows. Secretary Dunlap deserves our gratitude for stepping into the breach to take on adversaries of democracy. We intend to continue to fight for his right to access to the commission’s secret communications. President Trump can dissolve the commission, but the law doesn’t allow him or the commission to slink away from view and avoid accountability,” Austin Evers, the group’s executive director said in a statement.Two other suits against the commission were recently dismissed, but there were a handful still pending. Lawyers for the Department of Justice, which is defending the commission, filed notices Wednesday in the pending cases, noting that the panel had been dissolved and that the lawyers needed to confer on how to proceed.“If they think we’re not entitled to the information that I requested because they dissolved the commission, I think they’re wrong,” Dunlap told HuffPost in an interview. “I do intend to pursue it with probably greater vigor than before.” While Dunlap said he wasn’t entirely surprised by Trump’s decision to end the commission after the judge ruled in his favor in December, he said those celebrating should be wary of his decision to designate voter fraud issues to the Department of Homeland Security. The agency, he said, has wide latitude in what it can do to exert control over elections, particularly given that the agency now classifies elections as “critical infrastructure.”Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, one of the groups that sued the commission, said in a statement: “The President’s Election Integrity Commission was a vehicle launched for the sole purpose of laying the groundwork to promote voter suppression policies on a national scale. This unprecedented effort demonstrated this administration’s clear hostility to voting rights. We mounted successful litigation against the administration that exposed its failure to abide by federal transparency requirements and vowed to keep fighting until the Commission was terminated.”Kobach, who did not return an interview request Wednesday, blamed the lawsuits for the dissolution of the commission. He told The Kansas City Star he would work with DHS as it began to investigate voter fraud. “This is a tactical shift by the president who remains very committed to finding the scope of voter fraud,” he told the newspaper. “In a perfect world, the commission would’ve moved swiftly and there wouldn’t be any lawsuits.”In an interview with The Associated Press, he also blamed Democrats for stalling the commission’s work.“The Democrats, both on and off the commission, made very clear that they were not interested in determining the scope and extent of voter fraud and, indeed, they were trying to stop the commission in its tracks,” Kobach said. “The Democrats lost their opportunity, lost their seat at the table, by stonewalling.”Dunlap, however, responded, “All I was asking to do was participate. I doubt Secretary Kobach can eliminate public scrutiny of his work by hiding it even deeper.”King echoed Dunlap’s concerns, saying Kobach had become “delusional.”“These people have absolutely no concept of how elections are organized, implemented and conducted. Their ideology has blinded them to truth. They want to suppress the vote so strongly that they have become delusional,” King said. “They are so addicted to the concept of power and the quest for power that they have abandoned all that is fair, right and decent.”J. Christian Adams and Hans von Spakovsky, two conservative members of the commission who were Kobach allies, accused Democrats and other groups of obstructing the panel’s work.“Unfortunately, there are plenty of well-funded groups, activist academics and individuals who are not credible who sought to undermine and sabotage the Commission’s work. They may delight today in the dissolution of the Commission, but before long they’ll realize that advocates of election integrity have more stamina, support and perseverance than they realize,” Adams, who told HuffPost in December he was confident the panel would meet again, said in a statement.The White House also began to distance itself from the commission’s work on Wednesday. A White House official told Politico the panel had been an idea of Steve Bannon’s and “not a good one.” CNN quoted a White House official as describing the panel as a “shitshow” and said there was concern the commission’s request for voter information may have been illegal. The sudden dissolution of the panel is a victory for voting rights advocates, who relentlessly attacked the panel and the officials on it who had a history of exaggerating voter fraud. “President Trump created his sham voting commission to substantiate a lie he told about voter fraud in the 2016 election,” Jason Kander, founder of Let America Vote, said in a statement. “When he couldn’t come up with any fake evidence ... he had no choice but to disband his un-American commission. President Trump won’t stop lying about voter fraud, or end his assault on voting rights, but today is a good day for democracy. Good riddance.” “This commission was a sham from the start and everyone recognized it. We have real problems when it comes to elections: low voter turnout, unnecessary barriers to participation, outdated and insecure machines, and possible foreign interference,” said Dale Ho, director of the Voting Rights Project at the ACLU, another group that sued the commission. “But rather than address these real threats to election integrity, the commission engaged in a wild-goose chase for voter fraud, demonizing the very American voters whom we should all be helping to participate — with the not-so-secret goal of making voting harder with unnecessary barriers.”This article has been updated with comment from Adams and Spakovsky, as well as from Houlton.

I’m sure that I have inadvertently hurt people in physical scenes,” Streep said. “But there’s a certain amount of forgiveness in that. But this was my first movie, and it was my first take in my first movie, and he just slapped me. And you see it in the movie. It was overstepping. But I think those things are being corrected in this moment. And they’re not politically corrected; they’re fixed. They will be fixed, because people won’t accept it anymore. So that’s a good thing.”According to biographer Michael Schulman, who published a book about Streep’s career in 2016, the actor also taunted her about the death of her boyfriend, actor John Cazale, to provoke a reaction for the camera. Streep apparently later forgave his on-set behavior after he apologized. Hoffman has been at the center of multiple allegations of sexual misconduct from women including an intern on on the set of a TV movie and a friend of his daughter’s, both of whom were teenagers at the time. Things came to a head at a contentious panel led by John Oliver last month when the host publicly confronted Hoffman about the groping accusations. While Streep refuses to name other individuals who’ve mistreated her in the film industry, the actress told the Times that she felt “really beaten up” in the early days of her career, when drugs ran rampant on film sets.“I have experienced things, mostly when I was young and pretty. Nobody comes on to me [now]. So I wouldn’t have had that more recently,” she said. “But back in the day, when everybody was doing cocaine, there was a lot of [expletive] behavior that was inexcusable. But now that people are older, and more sober, there has to be forgiveness, and that’s the way I feel about it.”She added, “I do think if the world is going to go on, we have to find out a way to work together, and know that it’s better for men if they respect us deeply as equals.”To read Streep’s full interview, head over to The New York Times."

Since then not much has changed for the birds, but they taught me something that has shifted me internally forever.On this tiny atoll an astonishing tragedy is taking place: tens of thousands of baby albatrosses lie dead on the ground, their stomachs filled with plastic. Their parents mistake floating trash for food as they forage over the vast polluted Pacific Ocean. Carrying shards of plastic back to the island inside their bellies, the adult birds unknowingly feed lethal quantities of it to their chicks.Midway’s remoteness makes this phenomenon particularly iconic: The island lies near the center of the Pacific, surrounded by 60 million square miles of open sea in every direction. It is the furthest you can get from a continent anywhere on Earth.For me, kneeling over these scenes is like looking into a macabre mirror. Midway reflects back to us one appallingly emblematic consequence of the collective trance of our culture of mass consumption. Bloated with emptiness and dying of excess, we humans, like the albatross, find ourselves losing the ability to discern what is nourishing from what is toxic – to our bodies and our spirits, our politics and our culture.In my eight trips to Midway I lost count of how many birds I witnessed choking on cigarette lighters, toothbrushes, bottle caps, and other plastic junk. I held the softness of their still-warm feathered bodies in my arms as feelings of sadness, rage, and shame washed over me in waves. And in that experience I received a transformational message: the true nature of grief revealed itself.I had always thought of grief as a bad feeling, like pain, not to be embraced but to be minimized and gotten over. Grief seemed to be part of the darkness, a bad drug to be avoided. I had held it off for my whole life, fearing it like a slippery slope that could lead to depression and anxiety, and overwhelm.The albatross showed me that grief is not the same as sadness or despair; grief is the same as love. It is a felt experience of love, for something we are losing or have lost. We feel grief for the suffering of other beings because we love them. In grief the bottom drops out and we fall, not into an abyss of hopelessness, but into a clear blue sea, the infinite ocean of love that we each contain. Grief is a portal to the deepest part of ourselves, where our wisdom and compassion reside.Grief and love can be seen as inseparable twins. When we hold grief at a distance, our love becomes inaccessible; and when we embrace grief, we reconnect with the essential aspect of our being that has gone missing lately. I believe that if we could summon the courage to grieve together, on a collective scale, for all that is being lost in our world, then our love would return and, along with it, our generosity, joy, and peace. And if we were to step through that door together, there is no knowing how many of the world’s problems we could solve, and fast.In this way the message of these birds is not only one of horror and tragedy, but also of beauty and renewal. The legendary albatross guides us to take a moment and grieve together, not as an exercise in shame or pain or punishment, but because in this act of surrender a doorway opens that leads home.Artist/photographer Chris Jordan is director, editor, and writer of ALBATROSS, a film made from footage he and his team filmed on Midway Island over several years. ALBATROSS will be released as a public artwork this spring. More info: www.albatrossthefilm.comFor more content and to be part of HuffPost’s new economy community join our Facebook Group."
73,POLITICS,Some Trump Supporters Think Mueller's Grand Jury Has Too Many Black People,Ryan J. Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/robert-mueller-grand-jury-trump-blacks_us_5a4c2efce4b0b0e5a7a9621c,The racist attack on the federal grand jury in D.C. adds to the ways the president's backers are trying to discredit the Russia probe.,2018-01-03,Special counsel Robert Mueller leaves the Capitol after briefing members of the U.S. Senate about his investigation on June 21.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a4c2f391d000027005c1f6c.jpeg?cache=wpBm9WbqfW&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Supporters of President Donald Trump have opened a new line of attack on the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election: They think special counsel Robert Mueller’s federal grand jury has too many black people on it.A Trump associate who “recently testified” complained to New York Post columnist Richard Johnson that the members of the grand jury in Washington looked like they came from a Black Lives Matter protest.“The grand jury room looks like a Bernie Sanders rally,” the witness told Page Six. “Maybe they found these jurors in central casting, or at a Black Lives Matter rally in Berkeley.”The complainant contended that 11 of the 20 grand jurors in the room during the testimony were African-Americans, which isn’t a surprising figure because it roughly lines up with the percentage of black residents of the District of Columbia. The witness also told Page Six that there “was only one white male in the room, and he was a prosecutor.”If the witness recently testified before the grand jury, which is charged with determining whether there’s probable cause to indict any additional Trump campaign figures, that witness presumably knows a lot about what precisely the grand jury inquiry is focused on at this point. But instead of pursuing that story, Page Six gave a sympathetic airing to the witness’s complaints about the racial makeup of the grand jury ― though the story did include a “racism” tag.The complaint about who serves on the D.C. grand jury was clearly a bad faith argument from someone who appears sympathetic to Trump and ― based on the fact that they were called to testify ― may have information of interest to Mueller’s team. Natasha Bertrand, a reporter for Business Insider, tweeted that she was pitched the story about the grand jury’s racial makeup about a month ago and “genuinely thought the person was joking.” Yet the Page Six column quickly gained traction in conservative media circles Tuesday night. Gateway Pundit wrote that the Page Six report indicated the grand jury was completely biased “and full of liberal hacks who most likely hate President Trump” and said it was “way past time for the unconstitutional witch hunt to be shut down.”Setting aside the precise demographics of this particular grand jury, it’s no secret that a selection of D.C. voters isn’t likely to include many Trump fans. The president received just 4.1 percent of the District’s votes in 2016, 90.9 percent of which went to Hillary Clinton. Page Six reported that the grand jury “doesn’t appear to include any supporters of President Donald Trump,” an assertion evidently based upon a Trump associate’s assumptions about the individuals in the room.But the complaints about the racial makeup of the jury seize upon widespread misunderstanding of the role of a federal grand jury and represent an attack on a fundamental component of the federal criminal justice system that you wouldn’t typically expect to hear from supporters of a president who ran a “law and order” campaign. The witness who testified before the grand jury complained to Page Six that it wasn’t “a room where POTUS gets a fair shake.” It is not, nor is it set up to be. Nobody gets a “fair shake” before a grand jury because its role is to serve as a (relatively weak) check on prosecutors, not to determine whether defendants are guilty of a crime.More broadly, the attacks on the grand jury fit into a larger pattern of Trump supporters undermining the entire Russia investigation by attacking Justice Department employees, the FBI and, most recently, Mueller ― a Republican former FBI director appointed as special counsel by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, also a Republican. On Tuesday, Trump tweeted his complaints about the “deep state” Justice Department and called for it to jail a former top Clinton aide. The complaints about the racial makeup of the grand jury might give him new ammunition.Ryan Reilly is HuffPost’s senior justice reporter, covering criminal justice, federal law enforcement and legal affairs.

74,POLITICS,"NYC Crime Hits Historic Low, Defying Dire Predictions About End Of Stop And Frisk",Nick Wing,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nyc-crime-stop-and-frisk_us_5a4bc91ee4b06d1621bb39ba,The falling crime rate has led some defenders of the controversial policy to admit they were wrong.,2018-01-03,"Bill de Blasio discusses New York City's stop-and-frisk policy in 2012, when he was the city's public advocate.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a4c32ae2100003e005f6ccb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Crime rates in New York City reached their lowest levels in recorded history last year, even as police continued to phase out the controversial stop-and-frisk policy. The decrease across all major felony categories followed nearly three decades of declines ― a trend that some pundits predicted would end once police scaled back the widespread practice of targeting people for warrantless searches.There were a total of 290 killings across New York in 2017, according to preliminary figures from the New York City Police Department, down from 335 homicides in 2016 and a peak of 2,245 in 1990. Other crimes, including rape, assault, grand larceny and car thefts, also fell from the previous year.The last time crime rates were this low was in the 1950s, NYPD Commissioner James O’Neill said in December. They were the “lowest since reliable records have been kept,” according to The New York Times.The steep declines suggest that defenders of New York’s stop-and-frisk policing were wildly off-base with their apocalyptic predictions. Much of this hand-wringing began in the run-up to the 2013 mayoral election, when many of the Democratic candidates, including the eventual victor, Bill de Blasio, ran as outspoken opponents of the policy.NYPD officers had sharply increased their reliance on stop and frisk in the preceding years, making a record 686,000 stops in 2011, with the vast majority involving younger African-American or Hispanic men. Nearly 90 percent of the people subjected to stops that year were completely innocent, while many others were ticketed or arrested for lower-level charges, often including drug possession, according to NYPD data cited by the New York Civil Liberties Union. And although supporters have touted stop and frisk as an effective deterrent of violent crime, a 2013 review of 4.4 million stops showed that police confiscated just 5,940 firearms, a rate that amounted to roughly 0.1 percent of all encounters.In August 2013, a federal judge ruled NYPD’s broad practice of stop-and-frisk policing unconstitutional, calling it “a demeaning and humiliating experience” for communities of color and a “policy of indirect racial profiling.” The department began to drastically reduce its use of the tactic, and by 2016, it had fallen 98 percent to 12,000 stops. Preliminary figures suggest the number of stops fell again in 2017, though racial disparities are still present. A federal official overseeing police reform efforts in New York also said last year that some officers aren’t properly documenting these encounters.According to defenders of stop and frisk, this downturn in stops should have been disastrous. In the lead-up to the 2013 ruling, then-New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg lambasted opponents of the tactic, calling the New York Civil Liberties Union “no better than the NRA” for suing the city over the policy.After the ruling, editorials from the New York Daily News and New York Post regularly warned that crime would rise as police backed away from stop and frisk. The outlets published a number of articles that seized on cherry-picked data to fit this narrative, even as overall violent crime continued to decline each year. In an August 2016 column, the editorial board of the New York Daily News finally said it had been wrong about the consequences of reducing these stops. A month later, then-presidential candidate Donald Trump proposed reinstating stop and frisk as a solution to violence in black communities, inaccurately claiming it had “brought the crime rate way down” in New York.With the nation’s most populous city now experiencing historically low crime rates, even some conservative critics are making an about-face. Kyle Smith, a columnist at the National Review, wrote a piece this week admitting “We Were Wrong about Stop-and-Frisk.”Although Smith had predicted that ending the practice would “cause an uptick, maybe even a spike, in crime rates,” he said de Blasio “was correct in saying the city could withstand a sharp decrease in “stop-and-frisk” and “was right to draw attention to the social cost of the practice.”In an email to HuffPost, Smith said he wasn’t a criminologist, but suggested New York’s experience should lead people of all political stripes to ask questions about policing tactics that incur a relatively high social cost for an uncertain benefit.“On the other hand, why has crime come down so much further in New York City than, say, New Orleans or Baltimore or St. Louis? That would seem to draw attention to the quality of policing,” he said. “Because we can’t study crime under lab-controlled conditions, we may never figure all of this out.”Smith’s article gratified vocal opponents of stop and frisk. “If conservatives could just acknowledge that some of their racist and s**tty arguments were racist and s**tty, we might be on the road back to a broadly agreed-upon reality upon which we can base our political and legal debates,” wrote Elie Mystal, executive editor of the Above the Law blog.But other conservative pundits continue to claim that New York’s lower crime rates are not evidence of the ineffectiveness of stop and frisk. In a separate column for National Review, Heather Mac Donald argued that “proactive-policing enabled gentrification” had led white “urban hipsters” to replace black “drug dealers and pimps” in many New York neighborhoods, fueling the city’s drop in crime. Mac Donald has been a chief proponent of the so-called “Ferguson effect,” a hotly contested theory holding that recent increases in crime are due to increased scrutiny of law enforcement following the fatal 2014 police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.In her column, Mac Donald cited a recent National Academy of Sciences study on proactive policing methods as proof that tactics like stop and frisk have short-term crime reduction effects. They should therefore be replicated in other cities, she wrote, regardless of concerns about racial bias or their potential to fracture relationships between police and the community.While the National Academy of Sciences study does show that stop and frisk can be effective, New York’s program was “indefensible” as it existed at its height, David Weisburd, chair of the National Academy of Sciences Committee on Proactive Policing and a professor of criminology at George Mason University, told HuffPost. NYPD’s indiscriminate use of the tactic provided relatively few benefits in exchange for a high potential for negative effects in the community, he said.“There’s a place for stop, question and frisk in policing, but it’s not a 700,000-stops-in-a-city place, carried out by untrained police officers, newly out of the academy,” Weisburd said. “It shouldn’t be used as a general strategy. You don’t apply an overwhelming radiation treatment to somebody that has a cold.”Although the NYPD has severely reduced its use of stop and frisk, it hasn’t abandoned the policy entirely. Weisburd said it might still make sense to apply it in a limited fashion in certain “hot spots” as a specific response to elevated levels of gun violence, in which a small percentage of offenders are often responsible for a high proportion of the crime. Such nuanced support for these tactics often gets lost in the current political climate, he said.But more generally, Weisburd cautioned against focusing on a specific data point to make broader arguments in favor or against a policy.“Police aren’t the only thing affecting crime. Economic situations, social factors, shifting norms in the community, those also might affect crime,” he said. “The world is complicated.”"

Through a combination of “rapid air technology” and targeted heat and air flow, the fryer fully cooks dishes like roasted rack of lamb in 30 minutes, roasted winter veggies in 20 minutes, and fried risotto balls in 10 minutes. Sounds a bit like, well, an oven, right? You’re not wrong, as both technologies use hot air to cook, but there are a few notable differences between air fryers and ovens, namely cooking methods, cooking time, and results. Ovens don’t use this ~fancy~ “rapid air technology” to cook, instead relying on heating elements and fans to disperse heat, which takes longer and doesn’t produce the same fried result. Ovens, on the other hand, are probably better for toasting, roasting and broiling. Still, if your New Year’s Resolution involves eating healthier versions of your favorite foods, an air fryer might just be the oil-free kitchen tool of your dreams. The Philips Airfryer comes at a hefty $250 price tag (though it can be found cheaper on Amazon) alongside other cheaper alternatives.If you’re in the market for an air fryer, we’ve pulled together a selection of different makes, models, sizes and price tags.

Sounds a bit like, well, an oven, right? You’re not wrong, as both technologies use hot air to cook, but there are a few notable differences between air fryers and ovens, namely cooking methods, cooking time, and results. Ovens don’t use this ~fancy~ “rapid air technology” to cook, instead relying on heating elements and fans to disperse heat, which takes longer and doesn’t produce the same fried result. Ovens, on the other hand, are probably better for toasting, roasting and broiling. Still, if your New Year’s Resolution involves eating healthier versions of your favorite foods, an air fryer might just be the oil-free kitchen tool of your dreams. The Philips Airfryer comes at a hefty $250 price tag (though it can be found cheaper on Amazon) alongside other cheaper alternatives.If you’re in the market for an air fryer, we’ve pulled together a selection of different makes, models, sizes and price tags.

Huge sections of the Arctic were among the areas that saw temperatures well above average, according to the University of Maine’s Climate Reanalyzer, which compares daily temperature anomalies to a baseline of data from between 1979 and 2000.Temperatures around the globe were nearly one full degree Fahrenheit, or 0.5 degrees Celsius, above average on Monday. The Northern Hemisphere, which is currently experiencing winter, was 1.6 degrees F (0.9 degrees Celsius) warmer than usual. In Antarctica, where a Delaware-sized iceberg broke off last summer, temperatures were 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit (0.8 degrees C) higher than normal. And the Arctic, which is warming about twice as fast as anywhere else on the planet, started 2018 with temperatures 6.8 degrees F (3.4 degrees C) warmer than average. A peer-reviewed report released last month by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration found that the Arctic is warming faster than at any point in the past 1,500 years, with 2017 its hottest year on record.Still, President Donald Trump ― who gutted environmental regulations and attacked efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions during his first year in office ― has seized on the cold snap in the northern Midwest and eastern United States in an attempt to refute the existence climate change. In a tweet on Thursday, the president conflated cold winter weather with climate, and suggested that the nonbinding Paris Agreement ― from which he announced plans to withdraw in June ― would cost the United States trillions of dollars. In reality, the U.S. contributed just $1 billion to the $100 billion Green Climate Fund set up under the Paris climate accord to help poorer countries invest in renewable energy and forgo coal-fired plants. “This one-week cold snap or two weeks, as it might end up being, isn’t going to change anything about any global climate signal,” Ryan Maue, an Atlanta-based meteorologist at Weather.us, told HuffPost.“When you have these cold events, how do you place these in a climate context?” he added. “This is just a typical January cold outbreak, and we still have record cold sometimes.”Breitbart’s James Delingpole, a conspiracy theorist and columnist who made his name attacking scientists, interpreted Trump’s tweet as the president “trolling his enemies like a boss” and baiting “climate loons.”“What normal people are seeing right now when they look out of their windows is weather so cold that the very last thing on their minds is trying to prevent ‘global warming,’” he wrote.However, weather and climate are two different things. Weather describes conditions of the atmosphere over a short period of time, while climate denotes long-term trends in how the atmosphere behaves, according to a succinct summary that has been available on NASA’s website since February 2005. Sixteen of the 17 hottest years in NASA’s 137-year record have occurred since 2001. The warmest year on record is 2016, and 2017 is in second place. "

The law requires any internet platform with more than 2 million users to implement a system for reporting and scrubbing potentially illicit content, including “threats of violence and slander,” according to Deutsche Welle.Under the new law, sites are given 24 hours (or seven days for more “legally complex” cases) to investigate and delete illegal content after a complaint is received. Violators face fines of up to $60 million. Social media sites, including Facebook, Twitter, Google, YouTube, Snapchat, and Instagram, will fall under the purview of the new law, according to Deutsche Welle. Professional networks like LinkedIn, however, are “expressly excluded, as are messaging services like WhatsApp.”The Local reported in August that Facebook had hired several hundred people in Germany to review and delete illegal content. Facebook said at the time it intended to increase the number of employees who review and delete content to 7,500 globally, from 4,500. Though the NetzDG law has been hailed by lawmakers as a necessary measure to push companies to “fulfil their obligations” to delete illegal content, opponents have called the legislation an “Orwellian” barrier to free speech."
