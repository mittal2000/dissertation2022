Kerner wrote that Conway “impermissibly mixed official government business with political views about candidates in the Alabama special election.”The OSC, which is unrelated to an ongoing investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller, recommended that the president take “disciplinary action” against Conway for ethics violations.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In a statement to NBC News, however, the White House denied that Conway had broken any laws, and claimed that her on-air comments “actually show her intention and desire to comply with the Hatch Act ― as she twice declined to respond to the host’s specific invitation to encourage Alabamans to vote for the Republican.”The OSC’s report concerns interviews that Conway gave to Fox News’ “Fox & Friends” and CNN’s “New Day” in November and December, respectively. Conway delivered both interviews from the grounds of the White House and was introduced as “counselor to President Trump.”During the interviews, Conway discussed Alabama’s special election for U.S. Senate and expressed support for Roy Moore, the Republican candidate in that race.Moore, a former judge, ran against Democrat Doug Jones, who ultimately won the election as Moore faced allegations of child molestation.In her November interview with “Fox & Friends,” Conway attempted to deter Alabamans from voting for Jones, calling him “weak on crime, weak on borders.”“He is strong on raising your taxes,” Conway said of Jones in that interview. “He is terrible for property owners.”Trump, who is not subject to the Hatch Act as president, endorsed Moore for Senate in early December. In a statement to the OSC, the Office of White House Counsel argued that Conway “intended [her] remarks to serve as policy commentary in the context of a broader discussion of the prospects of the President’s agenda in Congress, not as advocacy for or against a candidate.”The OSC said Conway has yet to respond to the allegations.Conway was previously found to have violated federal ethics rules in early 2017 when she endorsed Ivanka Trump’s clothing line during an appearance on “Fox & Friends.”“I’m going to give a free commercial here: Go buy it today, everybody. You can find it online,” she said.White House social media director Dan Scavino also violated the Hatch Act last year when he tweeted at Trump supporters to help defeat Republican Rep. Justin Amash (Mich.) in a primary. The OSC said it issued Scavino a warning.The Hatch Act, established in 1939, aims “to ensure that federal programs are administered in a nonpartisan fashion, to protect federal employees from political coercion in the workplace, and to ensure that federal employees are advanced based on merit and not based on political affiliation,” according to the OSC’s website. The president and vice president, and a handful of other federal employees, are exempt under the act."

Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down roughly 1.3 percent on Tuesday evening, while S&P 500 futures were down 1.1 percent. Cohn had been rumored to be considering leaving the White House over concerns with Trump’s recently-announced tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Cohn, a free-trade advocate, had lobbied Trump against the tariffs, and in recent days had reportedly planned a meeting at the White House with representatives from the aluminum and steel industries in an apparently unsuccessful attempt to change the president’s mind. “It has been an honor to serve my country and enact pro-growth economic policies to benefit the American people, in particular the passage of historic tax reform,” said Cohn in a statement. “I am grateful to the President for giving me this opportunity and wish him and the Administration great success in the future.”“Gary has been my chief economic advisor and did a superb job in driving our agenda, helping to deliver historic tax cuts and reforms and unleashing the American economy once again,” Trump said in a statement. “He is a rare talent, and I thank him for his dedicated service to the American people.”Cohn previously was reported to have considered resigning in August 2017 over Trump’s response to the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. In an interview with the Financial Times at the time, Cohn criticized Trump for blaming “both sides” for the violence, arguing that the White House “can and must do better in consistently and unequivocally condemning these groups.” There was also speculation that Cohn might leave the White House following the passage of the GOP tax plan late last year. Trump publicly addressed those rumors in January, calling Cohn himself on stage to address them during a media availability. He is the latest in a series of high-profile departures from the White House. Most recently, communications director Hope Hicks, one of the president’s most trusted advisers, decided to step down from her post. Prior to joining the White House, Cohn was the chief operating officer of investment bank Goldman Sachs. This is a developing story. Check back for updates."

The agreement, which was reportedly witnessed by several U.S. and Australian officials, occurred during the G20 meeting in Germany last July.Turnbull’s government reacted with shock last week when Trump announced that the U.S. would be imposing stiff tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum. In the immediate aftermath, Australian Trade Minister Steve Ciobo told local media that he was “seeking urgent clarification” from U.S. officials to see if Australia would be exempt. “I’m not going to provide a commentary on the Trump administration’s trustworthiness,” Ciobo said on Saturday when it became clear that Australia would likely not be spared. Any exemptions would ultimately be a decision for Trump, Ciobo said. However, White House officials have made clear that country-specific exemptions were unlikely.Although the U.S. is not a major market for Australian steel and aluminum exporters, Australian officials expressed concerns that the tariffs would trigger retaliatory measures that could deeply impact global trade. “My concern remains that off the back of actions like this, we could see retaliatory measures put in place by other major economies. That’s in no-one’s interests,” Ciobo said. Click here for more promises Trump broke during his first year in office."

Presumably, that didn’t go through. The contract carried no penalty for its dissolution ― often called a breakup or termination fee ― so there would have been little incentive for Contreras-Sweet and her group to see it through after realizing the numbers were unfavorable.Rather than buy the company outright, it seems the group plans to acquire TWC assets at a discount in bankruptcy.“I believe that our vision to create a women-led film studio is still the correct course of action,” Contreras-Sweet said in Tuesday’s statement. “To that end, we will consider acquiring assets that may become available in the event of bankruptcy proceedings, as well as other opportunities that may become available in the entertainment industry.”The original terms of the deal involved a $500 million bid, plus the assumption of $225 million worth of debt and an $80 million compensation fund for victims of TWC co-founder Harvey Weinstein’s harassment and abuse.Weinstein has been named in multiple well-substantiated allegations of sexual assault and harassment, with claims stretching back decades. After women began coming forward in autumn, the company board fired Weinstein, who later checked himself into rehab. Last month, prosecutors in New York announced they’re filing a lawsuit against TWC for failing to protect employees from Weinstein’s harassment."

But in this clip from VH1 the Democratic powerhouse talks with the queens about resistance and her work with the LGBTQ community. She also commends them for using their platforms to raise awareness for LGBTQ rights. “You’re an inspiration ― I hope you know ― because you really know your power,” Pelosi says. “It’s about taking pride.

5,POLITICS,"400 Moms Take Over Colorado Capitol Building, Press Legislators On Gun Control",Ryan Grenoble,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/moms-demand-action-colorado-capitol_us_5a9da297e4b0a0ba4ad6d88f,“It matters to show up. [Our legislators] need to see us.”,2018-03-06,Some of the 400 members of Moms Demand Action at the Colorado State Capitol on Monday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a9dc6341e000008087ad95e.jpeg?ops=crop_261_159_4304_2220%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"DENVER ― On Monday morning, around 400 mothers organized by the Colorado chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America gathered under the state capitol rotunda to support common-sense gun control policy.“We’re a group of moms whose primary concern is our children,” said Jen Clenahan, who has an eight-year-old daughter she calls the love of her life. That’s who she had in mind on Monday when she walked into the capitol ― like most of the members who have children, she imagined.“It matters to show up,” she said. “[Our legislators] need to see us.”Not all Colorado lawmakers are listening, however. The state Senate passed a bill on a party-line vote Monday morning that would scrap the state’s licensing process for concealed carry permits, instead allowing anyone “who legally possesses a handgun” to carry a concealed firearm. Another bill would repeal limits placed on high-capacity magazines after the 2012 theater shooting in Aurora, Colorado. Neither of the bills is likely to make it past the Democrat-controlled state House, but members of Moms Demand Action aren’t taking any chances. After briefly gathering for a photo, they fanned out through the marble hallways to find their representatives and express their opposition to the bills in person. Moms Demand Action is hoping to maintain the momentum for gun control that started last month after the high school shooting in Parkland, Florida. Clenahan said there’s a palpable energy after the shooting that’s different from the aftermath of other mass shootings, and she attributes it to the affected teenagers: “The kids are taking the lead,” Clenahan said. “They’re not just grieving; they’re angry.”Melody Connett, another member of Moms Demand Action, said she couldn’t understand why it’s taking so long for politicians to pass sensible gun control laws. She would know ― her daughter survived the school shooting at Columbine High School in 1999.The America Connett knows learns from its mistakes, she said, listing off a number of examples: We take our shoes off at the airport in response to the terrorist who tried to take down an airplane with a shoe bomb; in the 1980s, we changed consumer packaging laws after someone laced Tylenol with cyanide; our cars have seat belts and airbags now thanks to increasing federal standards.“We’re not going to 100 percent stop gun violence,” she conceded. “But we can make it better.”Another mom, Diana Thompson, runs a program for social and emotional learning programs in the state. She gained new appreciation for the pressures educators are under two weeks ago, when she conducted a training for 60 teachers.“There’s so much stress in our classrooms already,” said Thompson. “Adding guns is just a recipe for disaster.”Thompson sadly noted that simply preparing children for the possibility that someone could storm into their school with a gun ― and how to react ― is harmful all by itself.“The trauma we’re putting kids through under the guise of keeping them safe is making it worse,” she said. “Our children are literally on the front lines.”"

The dozens of mosquito species in the forest here live and bite at different heights, so the boards help monitor their preferences. Scientists used the 118-foot tower way back in 1947 to first identify a virus that, in 2015, became a global health emergency due to its ability to cause brain-related birth defects. They named the virus Zika, after this 30-acre forest in southern Uganda. Zika never caused the panic in Uganda that it did when it swept across the Western Hemisphere several years ago. Indeed, it was thought of as relatively harmless at first. But experts believe Zika has mutated since its discovery.The virus did not originate in Uganda, but was only identified here. The virus that caused concern in the Americas is believed to have migrated from a strain from Southeast Asia, moving via an infected traveler, or on boats with mosquitoes carrying the virus.Now experts from the UVRI are hunting for the next mosquito-borne virus they fear could sweep around the globe.“The world is a global village. Any disease that is here today can be anywhere else within 24 hours,” said virologist Dr. Julius Lutwama. He heads the team that searches for emerging infections at the Ugandan government-backed UVRI center. They focus on arbovirology, the study of insect-borne viruses.“I can leave here having been bitten by a mosquito but not be sick, but a few days later I could have taken a virus to an area far away,” he added.The scientists who first described Zika here found it during a study into another virus, the acute viral hemorrhagic disease yellow fever. It is just one in a long line of over 60 new viruses identified by the center since its founding in the 1930s.In Uganda, people had developed immunity to the virus, but elsewhere it would be a major problem.As the virus traveled through communities without immunity, it rapidly multiplied and its nature evolved. Scientists believe that was due to a mutation around 2013, roughly the time the medical community began to blame the virus for horrific birth defects.Three years ago, when the virus hit Latin America, the Caribbean and the southern United States, it put the whole world on edge because of its links to microcephaly (causing babies to be born with unusually small heads, physical disabilities and cognitive impairments) and Guillain-Barré syndrome (an autoimmune disorder that can cause paralysis). Brazil – the country hardest hit – recorded its first cases in 2015 of babies born with microcephaly. More than 2,000 cases of Zika-related birth defects were reported in Brazil over the next two years.The old research suddenly became vital.Panic caused by the Zika threat has eased a little as people cannot become infected twice. Meanwhile, researchers are working hard to develop a vaccine.Yet it was the research done over half a century ago into what was then an obscure virus ― at this virology center in the sleepy lakeside town of Entebbe ― that gave scientists a crucial head start. “The science and research that has been done at UVRI has helped us understand the viruses that are circulating in Uganda and the African region, but also has global importance,” said Lisa Nelson, the Uganda country director for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).The CDC is a key backer of the Ugandan center, providing some $23 million of funding since 2013, supporting research into HIV, hemorrhagic fevers and other infections.Rising global traffic means the wider and faster spread of viruses. That includes both the easy movement of people and of mosquitoes, with their eggs accidently carried across the globe in shipping containers.As scientists warn of changing global temperatures, mosquito species are expected to move into new areas.Lutwama, who is UVRI’s deputy director, heads surveillance teams that spend half their time in remote lands researching insect-borne diseases. They collect mosquitoes, then return to analyze samples and to map and monitor the spread of the viruses.“Which is the most likely next disease outbreak? For me, it is going to be an arbovirus,” said Lutwama, who has been hunting mosquito-borne viruses for over three decades.“Invasive species of mosquito are moving into Europe and into the Americas, and as they do that more of the viruses will spread,” he said.As viruses meet with new communities without immunity ― especially in dense, urban populations ― they multiply unhindered, changing rapidly.“Now when there is an outbreak, it spreads easily,” he said. “If it comes to a city, the mosquito moves within small areas but among many people.”Uganda hosts 224 mosquito species alone, Lutwama noted, with some 77 different arboviruses carried by insects, including West Nile virus and Dengue fever.Back in the Zika forest ― which means “overgrown” in the local Luganda language ― twisting paths vanish in the bush. But the forest is shrinking. Once, trees grew all along the lake’s edge, but construction of new homes has encroached onto ancient forest lands. Globally, Lutwama said, there are staggering numbers of organisms still unknown to science.“We know that there are up to 15 million species of living things that have not been identified yet, and the majority of these are microorganisms,” Lutwama said. “Many of these are living in areas we have not encroached upon yet, but we are starting to enter their territories. The likelihood that these become a problem to us is increasing every day.”Indeed, the next big disease might already be waiting to be identified.“Most viruses in Africa go undiagnosed,” he said.So the race is on to find it and study it before the next outbreak.In the depths of the trees, there is a thin, high whine of mosquitoes, and then up in the treetops, the laughing chatter of monkeys enjoying the breeze.“We have to be prepared for all eventualities,” Lutwama said, glancing up at the trees. “We have to look for them, before they get to us.”This article is part of HuffPost’s Project Zero campaign, a yearlong series on neglected tropical diseases and efforts to fight them.

There were hundreds and hundreds of messages, some written with perfect grammar and sober typefaces, others screeching and incoherent and laid out in Comic Sans. One author, a self-identified former UCLA crew letterman, somberly informed the chancellor that he was enclosing his old varsity sweater. The three players ― LiAngelo Ball, Cody Riley and Jalen Hill ― are black. Was the furious reaction about race? Not at all, said one correspondent, a little unconvincingly: “My decision is not based on the color of the skin of these thieves. Of my six grandchildren four are biracial.”Very much so, said another: “Don’t surprise me you LOOK LIKE A FUDGPACKING FAGGOT !@ YOU SHOULD BE SO PROUD, 3 MONKEYS GETTING FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE RIDE AND EMBARRASS YO SCHOOL BY ACTING LIKE THE NIGGERS THEY APPARENTLY ARE !” And on and on they went, the emails nearly universal in their disdain for the athletes. Many of them were clearly spurred on by the involvement of President Donald Trump, who was just then initiating a feud with LaVar Ball, father of LiAngelo. HuffPost obtained the emails via a public records request, and in them the whole modern American backlash is on display. Expressions of lofty disapproval, bloodthirsty formalism, coded racism, frank racism — hey, hey, the gang’s all here.“They have embarrassed their country as well as their race,” read one note. “They put shame on UCLA, their race and our country,” read another. “3 JERKS — DISGRACED THE COLLEGE — OUR COUNTRY AND THEIR RACE!” read a third, this one a handwritten letter.The full collection of emails and letters, all 637 pages, appears at the bottom of this post.First, some background: Ball, Riley and Hill, all freshmen, were arrested on Nov. 7 during the UCLA team’s early-season trip to China to play Georgia Tech. The players, according to Chinese authorities and later by their own admissions, had stolen sunglasses and other merchandise from three department stores in Hangzhou. On Nov. 15, Block and UCLA suspended the players indefinitely. Ball has since left the program to play professionally overseas. Hill and Riley are serving one-season suspensions. The arrests became a national story in part because of Trump, who claimed credit for helping the players avoid a possible 10-year prison sentence in China. Some of the emails sent to Block took their cues from Trump’s version of events. “Never again should anyone be allowed to commit a crime where President Trump has to come to UCLA’s rescue. It is absolutely disgusting,” one correspondent wrote. “The man who probably stands against just about everything the UCLA community defends comes to the rescue of people who unfortunately are associated with UCLA.”ESPN has since reported that UCLA officials had resolved the issue with Chinese authorities before they heard from Trump or White House Chief of Staff John Kelly. It was a simple case of minor theft, but from the wailing of the emails you might have thought the players had rampaged through the Forbidden City. Nothing short of the total annihilation of the young men’s academic and professional lives would suffice in the eyes of many of the emailers. The players deserved the full force of American (and perhaps even Chinese) law for having swiped and ultimately returned a few pairs of sunglasses and other merchandise. One emailer told Block to “recommend that they not be rewarded with any professional contracts.”Time and again, emailers returned to the theme that the players were “entitled” athletes who didn’t truly belong in college, especially not one as prestigious as UCLA. This racist exceptionalism ― the idea that black men can only earn their way into college through athletic talent ― flows in part from the reality of the school’s population. Black men make up only about 3 percent of the male student body at UCLA, and a majority of them are athletes. As a viral video produced by students noted, the university has had more national sports championships in its history than it had black male freshmen in 2013’s enrollment class. In the emails, the usual racial code words were frequently deployed. The athletes were called some variation of “entitled” or “spoiled” nearly 50 times. “Stupid,” “arrogant” and “above the law” also appeared regularly. There were at least 18 uses of “thug,” as in “entitled millionaire thugs,” in 14 separate emails. The players were also labeled “ingrates,” “fucking embarrassing morons,” “miscreant prima donnas” and “reprobates.”More than a dozen times, emailers explicitly referenced their own status as “taxpayers,” as if to suggest (in one writer’s view) that they were tired of “subsidizing” athletes like Ball, Riley and Hill.And sometimes, the emailers dispensed with the racial coding altogether. One subject line: “Black Basketball Thieves.” Another message declared that what the players did was “Super-Idiocy!” It went on: “And you’re going to let these morons earn a college degree at UCLA? Looks like they fulfill the stereotype of a ‘simpleton black athlete.’”The batch of emails included one that seemed to link the players to Michael Brown, the teenager shot and killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014. “It’s when people like them get away with stealing from shops that people like [redacted] feel just as entitled to do the same in Missouri.” In the documents provided to HuffPost, UCLA appears to have redacted the players’ names and any specific identification of them, as a way of formally protecting their identities. But you don’t need a decoder ring to figure out what these passages are trying to say (sic throughout):UCLA must send a strong message on what it expects from such role models ― let’s not lie to ourselves, that’s what they are to millions of young [redacted] males. It’s when people like them get away with stealing from shops that people like [redacted] feel just as entitled to do the same in Missouri. Then he gets angry when someone tries to stop him, and he charges at the cop ― and gets shot. It all starts when responsible institutions like UCLA give up on their responsibilities. Expel the thugs!Stealing designer sunglasses from Louis Vuitton in China while our president Trump is visiting is NOT who we are as a nation, but it is definitely who they are, a bunch of knuckleheads, lowlifes, thugs, and [redacted] with attitude.Why would you ever let trash like that out of the country?? It aint no big deal! No other country in the world would take the crap that we do from a minority 13% of a population for the majority of crime and other A-Z Any other minority in the US seem to be able to make it along with a moral compass. Not to excuse slavery but for decade’s now [redacted] that wants to half way follow the program will make it. Its time to not hear any more excuses and crutching!These three should not get a pass, just because of the color of their skin.If they are attending your university on scholarships I strongly suggest they loose them. They can turn to their hero Colin Kaepernick, GQ’s Citizen of the Year for help.What they did was not just stupid, it was ghetto and criminal, and we have no doubt that if there is another LA riot that they will be looting and vandalizing with their brothers.Congratulations for continuing to show China what American atheltes exist in this country.To some emailers, it was clear that the three players were experienced criminals ...I can only assume they have never been held accountable because they can shoot a ball into a basket.For these athletes to steal with the comfort level displayed showed they clearly had done this before.Pampered puss ants who probably let their trouser snakes out on campus screwing anything they see! FUCK EM!!... and that they weren’t good enough students to be at UCLA in the first place:Two of the fellows could hardly speak english.And did you notice that your student athletes had trouble reading their prepared statements? Shame on UCLA.How did these students get into UCLA in the first place? I bet it probably wasn’t scholastics. … Dumber than a 2nd coat of paint!I am embarrassed when your student athletics, like your arrested basketball players and even last year’s player [redacted] give interviews and use the word “ain’t ”. Children at age four learn that “ain’t” is not proper grammar and unacceptable. This example simply proves you have no regard for even teaching you student-athletics basic English grammar. Stop the nonsense.It is an embarrassment to our country and your so called “education system” (what in the world are you teaching them anyway?) to have such reprobates representing us in foreign countries. For too long California taxpayers have been subsidizing free education for questionable athletes/students. ... There needs to be more vetting of these student athletes, background checks, and general review of their understanding of civics and ethics, before California Taxpayers continue to subsidize these people.At a minimum, remove them from the basketball team. Of course this really means remove them from UCLA as they have no other use to be there since they can’t play basketball.I’m sick of paying for a full SCHOLARSHIP for future wifebeater/ drug dealing, criminal scum who get away with stuff that have a normal person in jail for 20 years, but they are “Great ballplayers”, so they get to skate free. Some even suggested the players were indicative of everything wrong with American culture by comparing them to Harvey Weinstein and other famous people implicated in sexual harassment and assault cases:[T]hey are toxic to the school and the sport just like serial sex predator Harvey Weinstein who is now a Hollywood pariah”UCLA cannot stand by and turn a blind eye to this disgrace...it is akin to the many in the entertainment industry whom allowed Harvey Weinstein and his ilk to victimize individuals in the name of money and fame. … I must insist - no, demand - that these disgraceful, criminal thugs be permanently expelled from UCLA for their heinous behavior and criminal acts.I’m particularly troubled by what appears to be the emerging excuse – that they’re young men, who made a very foolish mistake. To me, that’s a bit like Kevin Spacey coming out as gay when he’s charged with sexual misconduct.Look at the news; Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey and Louis C.K. The time to say enough is enough is now.For UCLA, if these young men are allowed to continue to be students there, at a time when entitlement is under such scrutiny because of the misdeeds in Washington, in Hollywood, news agencies, workplaces, academia and homes throughout the country, giving these players a pass adds insult to injury. Our moral and ethical scales are calibrated today to benefit the powerful over the ordinary. If they stay on campus, it may appear that UCLA is putting a thumb on the scale promoting star power at a time when we are at a moral crossroads.And some who emailed Block said that he and UCLA should have left the players in China to face legal proceedings and potential jail time there:I find it shameful that our President brought the thieving basketball players home.Hopefully they will go to jail in China.They rightfully deserved to be tried and punished under Chinese law.They deserve to be in a Chinese prison.Our country now owes a Communist country a favor. This is serious.This is one of the few times we have disagreed with the actions of the President. In our opinion, the young men should have received Chinese legal proceedings and suffered the consequences.Like a bubble gum chewer in China they should have been left to face a bamboo whip.Only a handful of the emails sent to Block suggested that the appropriate punishment for the petty crimes the players committed in China wasn’t to ruin their entire lives. “Chancellor Block,” one person wrote, “Please do not give up on these young UCLA men. Stick by them & help them grow.”"

There were hundreds and hundreds of messages, some written with perfect grammar and sober typefaces, others screeching and incoherent and laid out in Comic Sans. One author, a self-identified former UCLA crew letterman, somberly informed the chancellor that he was enclosing his old varsity sweater. The three players ― LiAngelo Ball, Cody Riley and Jalen Hill ― are black. Was the furious reaction about race? Not at all, said one correspondent, a little unconvincingly: “My decision is not based on the color of the skin of these thieves. Of my six grandchildren four are biracial.”Very much so, said another: “Don’t surprise me you LOOK LIKE A FUDGPACKING FAGGOT !@ YOU SHOULD BE SO PROUD, 3 MONKEYS GETTING FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE RIDE AND EMBARRASS YO SCHOOL BY ACTING LIKE THE NIGGERS THEY APPARENTLY ARE !” And on and on they went, the emails nearly universal in their disdain for the athletes.

13,POLITICS,Senate Democrats Help Advance Bill That Could Increase Risk Of Financial Crisis,Igor Bobic and Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/banks-financial-crisis-democrats_us_5a9ee620e4b002df2c5e594c,But only slightly. Nothing to worry about!,2018-03-06,"Democrats Jon Tester (left) and Mark Warner, both members of the Senate Banking Committee, support the bill.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a9ee8ea1e000008087adafb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― With support from Senate Democrats, Congress is on track to pass a bill that would enrich banks but slightly raise the odds of a financial crisis like the one that tanked the economy 10 years ago.Seventeen members of the Democratic caucus joined nearly all Republican senators on Tuesday in voting to advance the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, a bill that was co-sponsored by Senate Banking Committee Chair Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) and committee member Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.). The legislation garnered support from a mix of centrist and red-state Democrats, who argued it would help small community banks and make it easier for Americans to buy a home by increasing access to capital.“We’re talking about smaller banks, regional banks. They didn’t cause the financial crisis to begin with,” Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.) said Tuesday.That the legislation would also increase the risk of a financial crisis isn’t a criticism from some far-left interest group, however ― it’s the conclusion of the Congressional Budget Office, which produces independent, nonpartisan analysis of budgetary issues.In looking at the legislation’s costs, the CBO considered the odds of a systemically important financial institution failing or a broader financial collapse. “CBO estimates that the probability is small under current law and would be slightly greater under the legislation,” the budget scorekeeper said in a cost estimate published this week.The 2010 financial reform law, commonly known as Dodd-Frank, imposed a range of new regulations on financial institutions, including increased capital requirements that force banks to hold more capital relative to their assets. Dodd-Frank also subjected banks with more than $50 billion in consolidated assets to stricter scrutiny by regulators, requiring annual “stress tests” and “living wills” in order to prevent widespread disruption in case a bank fails.The Senate bill would relax longstanding capital requirements for small banks and raise the threshold for enhanced prudential regulation from $50 billion in assets to $250 billion, exempting 25 of the 38 largest banks in the U.S.The CBO report warns that subjecting fewer assets to enhanced regulation would “increase the likelihood that a large financial firm with assets of between $100 billion and $250 billion would fail.” The report cites academic literature suggesting that a 1 percent decrease in a bank’s capital-to-assets ratio can increase the risk of failure by between 5 and 60 percent.Democrats often cited the CBO’s work in last year’s debates over repealing the Affordable Care Act, but now some seemed skeptical about the agency’s analysis.“I can tell you that I think [the risk of financial crisis is] very, very small, because as [Federal Reserve Chair Jerome] Powell said the other day, if they’ve got a risky business plan, we’re going to regulate them,” Tester said. “Doesn’t matter what the number is. And so I feel fairly confident that the Fed will continue to do their job.”Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), who also voted to advance the bill, said he agreed.“I don’t think we’re boosting chances of a financial crisis. I think we’re responding to the concerns of smaller banks in America that haven’t been able to serve their customers well,” Bennet said.Although the bill is supposed to benefit small banks, the CBO said it’s possible that JP Morgan and Citibank, specifically, would benefit from changes to the way that regulators measure capitalization for banks that are “predominantly engaged in custody, safekeeping, and asset servicing activities.”The bill would allow such firms to omit assets held by central banks, like the Federal Reserve, for the purposes of calculating the supplementary leverage ratio (SLR), which is one measure that regulators use to determine sufficient capitalization for large firms. Not counting those assets would mean large financial institutions didn’t have to hold as much capital. Bank of New York, State Street and Northern Trust are the three banks that would clearly benefit, according to the CBO.“CBO assumes that there is a 50 percent chance that regulators would allow two other financial institutions ― JP Morgan and Citibank, with combined assets of $4.4 trillion ― to adjust their SLRs under the terms in the bill,” the agency wrote.But Tester didn’t seem to believe that either, disputing the notion that large banks might be able to take advantage of the carveout. “Who said that?” he asked HuffPost on Tuesday. “Citibank? No, I don’t agree with that at all. I don’t know where they got that information at all.”It would be easy for the bill’s authors to clear up the confusion by adjusting the legislative text, said Mike Konczal, a fellow with the liberal Roosevelt Institute. He added that senators shouldn’t be picking regulatory winners and losers.“The whole point of Dodd-Frank was to get away from the mindset of micromanaging carveouts for this or that kind of financial firm and instead apply strong rules across the financial sector,” Konczal said.The Crapo bill contains a host of other provisions, including one that would reduce data collection used to detect discriminatory lending practices and others that Democrats say would protect consumers. The Senate is expected to vote on final passage of the bill later this week. It’s unclear whether the House would vote to pass it as is or amend it with other changes, such as provisions undermining the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. That agency, created under President Barack Obama, is a favorite target of congressional Republicans.“If they do [make changes], it’ll probably kill the bill,” Tester told reporters on Tuesday.Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), the ranking Democrat on the Banking Committee, said the CBO’s analysis validated his opposition to the bill.“The independent budget scorekeeper confirmed what we know ― this bank giveaway bill will cost taxpayers,” Brown said in a statement."

The “Fresh Off the Boat” breakout is gearing up for a banner summer, with a starring role in the much-anticipated comedy, “Crazy Rich Asians,” due out in August. But as her Hollywood career reaches new heights, the actress said she’ll continue to take on roles that require her to use accents, even if some people may interpret such characters as perpetuating Asian stereotypes. Wu, who is of Taiwanese heritage, explained her decision in a March 2 Facebook post. “To turn down a role simply bc of an accent actually reinforces that biased culture,” she wrote. “And I will never make career choices that reinforce a non-Asian person’s ridicule of what is simply a product of immigration.”She continued: “I think we should have pride in selecting those roles and not just blindly apply the word ‘stereotype’ to anything that has an accent.” ‬Wu has never been one to bow to Asian-American stereotypes. At January’s Women’s March in Los Angeles, she delivered an impassioned speech that called for better portrayals of Asians in media. “I march today for Asian-American women who have been ignored, or judged or fetishized or expected to be a certain way to fulfill a certain idea of what a sweet girl should be,” Wu said in her speech. “To that, I say you can be anyone you want to be.” "

HuffPost managed to get inside anyway. There, Spencer stood in a largely empty auditorium often used for livestock auctions, speaking to just 30 or 40 people, despite claiming to having issued 150 tickets for the event. He blamed the unrest outside for the paltry attendance. A livestream camera focused tightly on him, never panning out across the small crowd. He rambled on about wanting to create ethno-states and “re-immigrating” people back to their homelands.

(Afterwards, three Spencer fanboys were arrested for shooting a gun at counter-protesters.) Spencer — who is most famous for getting punched in the face on Inauguration Day — has had help litigating his way onto college campuses across the country to recruit young members to the so-called “alt-right.” Since the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August — which ended with an alleged neo-Nazi driving a car into a crowd of protesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer and injuring a score more — Spencer crony Cameron Padgett and white nationalist attorney Kyle Bristow have been busy suing or threatening to sue state universities that have refused to allow Spencer to speak. Last year, Michigan State University refused Padgett’s request to reserve a room for Spencer at the school, citing security concerns after the violence in Charlottesville. Padgett and Bristow sued, and in January, the school settled: Spencer would get to speak, and the university was on the hook for whatever security costs the event would incur.Padgett has also sued or threatened to sue the University of Cincinnati, Ohio State University, Penn State University, and Kent State University over those schools’ apparent refusal let Spencer speak on campus.

The new guidelines, first reported by E&E News and later by The Hill, end U.S. bans on the import of such trophies from Zimbabwe and Zambia.The decision comes nearly four months after Trump stepped in to halt his own administration’s decision to begin allowing hunters to import elephants killed in the two African countries. The president called such trophy hunting a “horror show.” He drew rare accolades from environmentalists at the time, who said they were surprised that Trump would move to uphold environmental protections.“What the agency just did with this memo is completely contrary to everything Trump has been saying,” Tanya Sanerib, a senior attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity, said in an interview. Environmental advocates say it’s unclear if the new move will result in additional elephant trophy imports, but the guidelines give more leeway to hunters to apply for permits. The Fish and Wildlife Service has already updated its webpages on the import of sport hunted trophies for both elephants and lions.In November, the agency reversed an Obama-era ban on the importation of elephant trophies from Zimbabwe and Zambia, determining that sport hunting in those countries would “enhance the survival of the species in the wild,” a spokesperson said at the time.The decision was first revealed publicly by Safari Club International, a trophy hunting advocacy group with close ties to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. The group, along with the National Rifle Association, sued to block the 2014 ban on elephant trophies from Zimbabwe. Late last year, a federal appeals court ruled that the Obama administration did not follow proper procedures when it instituted the ban. Among other things, it failed to invite public comment, the court said.The Trump administration based its decision allowing case-by-case permits on the court’s opinion, writing in the memo that so-called enhancement findings are “no longer effective for making individual permit determinations for imports of sport-hunted African elephant trophies.”Some wildlife experts said the memo complicates the administration’s stance on conservation at the expense of animals desperately needing protection. The memo also withdrew findings related to the Endangered Species Act for trophies taken from bontebok, a species of antelope, elephants and lions hunted in several other countries.“Our biggest concern is there’s been too much back and forth by the U.S. government to the point of really confusing the public,” Jimmiel Mandima, the director of program design at the African Wildlife Foundation, said. “Why does the decision keep flopping, are we hunting or are we not hunting?”Mandima, who noted that his group has long opposed the hunting of threatened, vulnerable or endangered species, said such confusion makes it difficult for the public to voice opinions about the issue, and harder for environmental groups to craft conservation recommendations.Several environmentalists on Monday pointed out that the new import guidelines haven’t been made public, and Freedom of Information Act requests to determine what “case-by-case” actually means will likely take months. In that time, an unknown number of applications could be approved.“We saw the public outcry last fall when [the trophy decision] was announced … not just from people who are traditionally Democrats,” Sanerib said. “The agency is really playing hide the ball. It’s incredibly disappointing.”It’s unclear if Trump supports the new Fish and Wildlife Service guidelines. The White House did not immediately responded to HuffPost’s requests for comment. A Fish and Wildlife spokesperson said in an emailed statement that Trump “has been very clear in the direction that his administration will go.”“Unfortunately, since aspects of the import permitting program for trophies are the focus of ongoing litigation, the Department is unable to comment about specific next steps at this time,” the spokesperson added.This article has been updated to include comment from the Fish and Wildlife Service spokesperson.

Kate Brown (D) signed new gun safety legislation into law on Monday, making the state the first to tighten its firearm regulations since last month’s mass shooting at a high school in Florida.The bill expands an existing law to prevent intimate partners who have a domestic violence or stalking conviction from buying and keeping guns. Until now, the state’s law only applied to married partners, and the new measure closes what was termed the “boyfriend loophole.”“I’m proud to sign this bill, making Oregon the first state to take action to prevent senseless gun violence since the tragedy in Parkland, Florida,” Brown said in a statement. “Today marks an important milestone, but we know we have more to do. It’s long past time we hold the White House and Congress accountable. Now’s the time to enact real change and federal gun safety legislation.”The bill was introduced in January, but the governor called it “historic” because state legislators decided to advance the measure in response to the Parkland shooting.Major gun retailers including Walmart and Dick’s Sporting Goods changed their policies on selling guns because of the Florida shooting. But besides Oregon, no states ― or Congress ― have passed any new laws aimed at reining in gun violence.To the contrary, Florida state legislators voted Saturday to keep AR-15s legal. These military-style rifles have been used in a number of mass shootings around the country ― including in the Parkland massacre that left 17 dead.Oregon, too, still allows the sale of military-style rifles."

(The New York Times reported last year that the Trump family’s coat of arms actually belonged to another family ― though it has been modified, including by replacing the word “Integritas,” Latin for “integrity,” with the word “Trump.”)Eagle Sign and Design, a metalworking and sign company with offices in Indiana and Kentucky, confirmed to ProPublica that it had produced the plates with the U.S. presidential seal after sharing a photo of them on Facebook.There no longer appear to be any photos of the plates on the business’ Facebook page, but the page does show an empty photo album labeled “Presidential Seal” and captioned “Trump International Golf Course.”“We made the design, and the client confirmed the design,” Joseph E. Bates, who owns Eagle Sign and Design, told ProPublica while declining to identify the customer.ProPublica and WNYC reported that they had reviewed an order form that listed Trump International as the buyer.Eagle Sign and Design and the Trump Organization did not respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment on Monday.It is illegal to use the U.S. presidential seal in a way that would convey or give a false impression of sponsorship or approval by the U.S. government. It is also illegal to knowingly manufacture, reproduce, sell or purchase the presidential seal for resale.The penalty is a fine and/or imprisonment of not more than six months.Past presidents have used the seal on custom-made items, like golf balls, dishes and even socks. But it would be illegal for a private company to use the presidential seal, Richard Painter, vice chairman of the government accountability group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, told ProPublica.“If we had heard of a private company using it for commercial purposes, we would have sent them a nasty letter,” said Painter, who served as an associate White House counsel during the George W.

(The New York Times reported last year that the Trump family’s coat of arms actually belonged to another family ― though it has been modified, including by replacing the word “Integritas,” Latin for “integrity,” with the word “Trump.”)Eagle Sign and Design, a metalworking and sign company with offices in Indiana and Kentucky, confirmed to ProPublica that it had produced the plates with the U.S. presidential seal after sharing a photo of them on Facebook.There no longer appear to be any photos of the plates on the business’ Facebook page, but the page does show an empty photo album labeled “Presidential Seal” and captioned “Trump International Golf Course.”“We made the design, and the client confirmed the design,” Joseph E. Bates, who owns Eagle Sign and Design, told ProPublica while declining to identify the customer.ProPublica and WNYC reported that they had reviewed an order form that listed Trump International as the buyer.Eagle Sign and Design and the Trump Organization did not respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment on Monday.It is illegal to use the U.S. presidential seal in a way that would convey or give a false impression of sponsorship or approval by the U.S. government. It is also illegal to knowingly manufacture, reproduce, sell or purchase the presidential seal for resale.The penalty is a fine and/or imprisonment of not more than six months.Past presidents have used the seal on custom-made items, like golf balls, dishes and even socks. But it would be illegal for a private company to use the presidential seal, Richard Painter, vice chairman of the government accountability group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, told ProPublica.“If we had heard of a private company using it for commercial purposes, we would have sent them a nasty letter,” said Painter, who served as an associate White House counsel during the George W. Bush administration.Trump’s ties to his pre-White House businesses have raised a number of ethics concerns.Last year, critics denounced a State Department blog post that promoted Trump’s private Mar-a-Lago estate and club in Palm Beach, Florida.

She noted that research shows economic power is the “most promising entry points for gender equality.” “Simply put when money flows into the hands of women who have the authority to use it, everything changes,” she wrote.Gates broke down how women’s economic empowerment is key to gender equality, saying families benefit when women control household finances. “Research shows ... that women are much more likely than men to buy things that set their families on a pathway out of poverty, like nutritious food, health care, and education,” Gates wrote. Additionally, Gates noted, when women have economic power, communities begin to rethink the roles women play in society. “Women acting on their own can do what all the philanthropic organizations in the world can never accomplish: change the unwritten rule that women are lesser than men,” she wrote. “Our role, as we see it, is to make targeted investments that give women the opportunity to write new rules.”According to the op-ed, the donation will fund a three-pronged approach to economically empowering women: First, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will support and organize female farmers so they can sell their products at competitive prices; Second, the foundation will work in eight countries, including India, Pakistan and Tanzania, to promote women using digital bank accounts; And lastly, the foundation will facilitate self-help groups allowing women and girls share information about “everything from launching a small business to raising healthy children.” Head over to Quartz to read Gates’ full op-ed.

After reading about how the city’s water crisis affected its public schools, JUST’s CEO, Ira Laufer, decided the donations were simply necessary. “This just makes sense for us to do,” Laufer told MLive. “After reading more about [Flint’s] challenges and the mayor objecting to pulling bottled water from the schools, we thought, ‘Let’s help these kids.’”Will and Jaden Smith founded JUST in 2015 to provide a green alternative to plastic bottles and to invest in communities. JUST’s bottles are 82 percent plant-based, and the company has initiated long-term investments in Glens Falls, New York, the city where the water is sourced. The Flint water crisis became a national topic in 2014 after city officials began using the Flint River as the town’s main water source. The city’s pipes were dangerously corroded, and they polluted the water with dangerously high levels of lead. In one study, the Environmental Protection Agency found lead levels in the city’s water to be as high as 397 parts per billion, far above the federal limit of 15 ppb. Several city officials have been charged with involuntary manslaughter after at least 12 people died from a Legionnaires’ disease outbreak linked to the environmental catastrophe. The disease, a form of pneumonia, is spread by bacteria that can be found in drinking water.Today, Flint’s government has set up water bottle distribution stations to supply communities without access to clean water until lead levels return to EPA-approved limits. In 2017, the EPA awarded Flint a $100 million grant to begin replacing its water pipes. Completion is slated for 2020."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a9dd3ba1e000008087ad969.jpeg?cache=hEJnyQL44B&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In every state, cops have enormous power.It’s still legal for police officers to have sexual contact with people in their custody in 35 states. Given that there no laws against sexual contact with suspects throughout the U.S., it’s even legal for police officers to engage in this behavior with sex workers and arrest them afterward. A group of sex workers and sex worker advocates in Alaska are working to change this, but it continues to be a pervasive practice among law enforcement. Criminals benefit from this abuse of power: In the past six months, several men have been accused of impersonating police officers in order to rape or harass women.On Jan. 25, 54-year-old Stanley Troy Friesen from Tracy, California, was arrested after he allegedly raped a woman in nearby Milpitas. He had arranged to meet with a sex worker he met online and, pretending to a police officer by brandishing a gun and a fake badge, proceeded to rape her. A few months earlier, 41-year-old Salt Lake City resident Christopher Scott was arrested for impersonating a police officer to rape a sex worker he’d arranged to meet with on Backpage. Salt Lake City police have reportedly been in touch with other victims, and encouraged others to come forward. Friesen faces charges of rape, sodomy, oral copulation and impersonating a police officer; Scott was charged with first-degree felony rape. Similar arrests have recently been reported in Connecticut, New Jersey and Maryland.The prevalence of men impersonating police is underreported, says Callie Marie Rennison, a professor at the University of Colorado Denver who published a 2012 study on the subject. “Law enforcement agencies rarely collect the exact number of police impersonation cases reported and investigated,” Rennison and co-author Mary Dodge wrote in the study, in which they examined 56 incident files from three metropolitan cities over eight years. “Only some police departments take the issue seriously,” she added.There are several issues complicating the tracking of these crimes. According to RAINN, 2 out of 3 of all sexual assault victims do not report it to police. Victims may not even be aware a perpetrator is not actually an officer. If they believe the perpetrator is indeed a member of law enforcement, they could feel unsafe going to the police. As the Friesen and Scott cases show, it is not unique for impersonators to target women who have a reasonable fear of turning to police to report violent crimes, like sex workers. “Some police departments don’t think it’s an issue at all,” Rennison told HuffPost. “I wish police would get behind it more.”Jim Pasco, executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police, said that the issue of police impersonation is taken “extremely seriously” among law enforcement.Jack Kitaeff, a lawyer and clinical psychologist who’s currently writing a book on the topic, says impersonation is “rampant” and a “precursor” to more violent crime. “I think that these are dangerous people,” he told HuffPost. “If you get someone who’s impersonating a police officer, you can make the hypothesis that this person is going to do something worse later on.” Take the case of Paul Winklebleck: In 2011, he impersonated a cop to kidnap and attempt to sexually assault two teenage girls in Portland, Oregon. They escaped, and he disappeared until his remains were found in 2015. Winklebleck was a pedophile who had been previously arrested for rape and sexual assault. Far-right terrorist Anders Breivik was dressed as a police officer before he detonated a bomb in Oslo and opened fire on the Norwegian island of Utoya in Norway in 2011, killing 77 people. Matthew Scheidt, infamous for impersonating a physician assistant as a teenager in central Florida, was later found guilty of police impersonation as well. In his research, Kitaeff has interviewed victims and perpetrators of police impersonation. He has found, he said, that motivations are twofold: to gain access to vulnerable victims, and the power trip and “pure thrill” of having people respond to them as authority figures. From his perspective as a clinical psychologist, he told HuffPost that many of these men (“It’s almost always guys,” he said) would likely be diagnosed with borderline personality or antisocial disorders. Kitaeff, like Rennison and Dodge, believes that the crime should be taken more seriously — not necessarily with harsher punishments like jail time or heavy fines, but with more vigorous intervention in the form of probation, therapy and counseling, or the removal of licenses.Police departments are more inclined to prioritize the “violent” aspect of impersonation crimes without focusing on the issue of impersonation, according to Rennison. The result, she said, is that the issue isn’t taken seriously nor seriously punished, and therefore harder to prevent from happening in the future.Friesen, for example, had allegedly impersonated a cop and sexually assaulted a woman before, said Dave Morris, a sergeant in the Milpitas Police Department. Police impersonation is only a misdemeanor in Milpitas, where Friesen was arrested in January; the maximum penalty is a year in county jail and a $1,000 fine.Another example of this is Christian Leon, who was first arrested for impersonating a member of law enforcement in March 2016 after pulling over a stripper in West Palm Beach, Florida, and posing as an officer. He was let go on bond despite Florida’s slightly more serious punishment for police impersonation (a felony in the third degree, with punishment up to five years in prison, five years probation, and a $5,000 fine). But a month later, he impersonated a police officer again — and escalated to the more serious attempt of sexual assault.The punishment in most states for impersonation is either a high-class misdemeanor or low-class felony. In some states, like Arizona or New York, charges are elevated if the perpetrator uses the impersonation to commit further crimes.“We know that laws alone don’t always stop criminals from being criminal. But longer or harsher sentences — that may include probation or house arrest —may require these offenders to be monitored in such a way that they have fewer opportunities to predate,” Rennison said.Pasco, of the Fraternal Order of Police, doesn’t believe that impersonating a cop should universally come with a harsher punishment. “I think it depends on what crimes ensued [from the impersonation],” he said. “If someone pretends to be a cop to get a free cup of coffee, that’s one thing. If someone pretends to be a cop and rapes someone, that’s something else entirely.”Sex worker advocates say that ultimately the crime of impersonation ― and the oft ensuing crime of sexually exploiting vulnerable women ― can be attributed to the long-accepted culture of law enforcement not taking violence against sex workers seriously. Maggie Mayhem, Bay Area-based former Sex Workers Outreach Project-USA Board member, pointed to the case of William Suff, a California man who impersonated a California Highway Patrol officer and murdered more than a dozen sex workers over a span of six years, from 1986 to 1992. “The standards for how law enforcement officers engage with sex workers have to be fundamentally restructured,” Mayhem told HuffPost. ″And society must acknowledge that sex workers are targeted for violence because of their context and not their morality.”"

In some states, like Arizona or New York, charges are elevated if the perpetrator uses the impersonation to commit further crimes.“We know that laws alone don’t always stop criminals from being criminal. But longer or harsher sentences — that may include probation or house arrest —may require these offenders to be monitored in such a way that they have fewer opportunities to predate,” Rennison said.Pasco, of the Fraternal Order of Police, doesn’t believe that impersonating a cop should universally come with a harsher punishment. “I think it depends on what crimes ensued [from the impersonation],” he said. “If someone pretends to be a cop to get a free cup of coffee, that’s one thing. If someone pretends to be a cop and rapes someone, that’s something else entirely.”Sex worker advocates say that ultimately the crime of impersonation ― and the oft ensuing crime of sexually exploiting vulnerable women ― can be attributed to the long-accepted culture of law enforcement not taking violence against sex workers seriously. Maggie Mayhem, Bay Area-based former Sex Workers Outreach Project-USA Board member, pointed to the case of William Suff, a California man who impersonated a California Highway Patrol officer and murdered more than a dozen sex workers over a span of six years, from 1986 to 1992. “The standards for how law enforcement officers engage with sex workers have to be fundamentally restructured,” Mayhem told HuffPost. ″And society must acknowledge that sex workers are targeted for violence because of their context and not their morality.”"

The “Girls Trip” actress attended Sunday night’s 90th Academy Awards ceremony where she presented the nominees for animated and live action short films. On the red carpet earlier in the night, Haddish made it known that her real reason for coming to the Oscars was to meet the one and only Streep. “I’m looking forward to meeting Meryl Streep and asking her to be my mama,” the actress told Ryan Seacrest during the red carpet pre-show.Later on, Haddish finally got her moment. The actress went rogue and ran over to a roped off walkway where Streep was walking and taking press photos. Haddish hopped the barrier ― dress and all ― and stopped traffic, putting her hands on her hips and looking square at Streep.The two hugged briefly as Streep laughed and continued walking. Haddish ended their quick meet and greet with a small curtsy, as one does when meeting Hollywood royalty. Haddish told People at the Governors Ball after-party that she was elated to meet her idol earlier in the night.“When I asked Meryl Streep to be my mama, [she said] of course! Best moment of the night!” Haddish said. Mission accomplished, Tiffany. "

Here's What It Means.,Lauren Moraski,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/frances-mcdormand-inlusion-rider-oscars_us_5a9cc623e4b0479c02542a3d,This tool has the power to change power dynamics in Hollywood.,2018-03-05,"Frances McDormand, winner of the Best Actress award for ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,"" poses in the press room during the 90th Annual Academy Awards on March 4, 2018.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a9d4f7d1f000051001692ea.jpeg?cache=qmQsJX1501&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"LOS ANGELES ― If you watched the Oscars Sunday night, then you probably heard the last two words of Frances McDormand’s speech: “inclusion rider.” Backstage in the press room, nearly everyone around me, including myself, scratched their heads and said something to the effect of, “What is that? And is it inclusion rider or inclusion writer?” We quickly started Googling and hunting on Twitter to figure it out. Aha, inclusion rider.After the telecast wrapped, a victorious McDormand, star of “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,” arrived in the press room ― with her best actress Oscar in hand. Not surprisingly, the topic came up.“Please explain your comment at the end ― the two words ‘inclusion rider,’” one reporter asked. McDormand said: “Right. I just found out about this last week. There is, has always been available to all ― everybody that gets, that does a negotiation on a film ― an inclusion rider which means that you can ask for and/or demand at least 50 percent diversity in not only the casting, but also the crew. And so, the fact that we, that I, just learned that after 35 years of being in the film business ― it’s not, we’re not going back. So the whole idea of women trending, no. No trending. African-Americans trending, no. No trending. It changes now, and I think the inclusion rider will have something to do with that. Right? Power in rules.”McDormand may have only learned about inclusion riders last week, but the concept has been circulating for at least a year.Kalpana Kotagal of the law firm Cohen Milstein worked on drafting the inclusion rider with Stacy Smith, founder of the University of Southern California’s Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, alongside producer and actor Fanshen Cox DiGiovanni. So, what is it? “It’s a short addition to a contract that an actor can take into negotiations with a studio that would provide for a hiring and casting process that basically follows some best practices and helps to cut through some unconscious bias to hopefully lead to casting and crew hiring that better reflects the world that we live in,” Kotagal told HuffPost. Kotagal says that some A-listers and production companies have already started successfully using the provision. Her hope is that it becomes the norm in the industry. “Women like Ava DuVernay and Shonda Rhimes have been using these kinds of hiring practices in their own work for as long as they’ve had the power to be able to do it,” Kotagal said. “This contractual provision is about is giving those who have the bargaining power in the industry, historically straight white men, giving them the tool to say, ‘I’m going to use my bargaining power to drive change in this industry.’”“That’s why it’s different than lots of other tools. It doesn’t call on those who have struggled to find a place in the industry to also be the source of the solution,” she said. “Instead it says, those of you who have power, who want to make change, here’s your tool do it.”Kotagel had no idea McDormand would mention an inclusion rider in her acceptance speech Sunday night. But she’s certainly glad she did. “We knew this had to take off at some point,” said Kotagel. “It’s a common sense solution to what has been a thorny and hard-to-address problem.”McDormand’s passion for the Time’s Up movement to fight harassment and inequality is part of the reason she decided to attend the Academy Awards this year.“As you know, I don’t show up all the time. I only show up when I can and when I want to, but I was there at the Golden Globes and it’s almost like there was an arc that started there. It doesn’t end here,” she said backstage. “We actually started a conversation that will change something.”McDormand’s comments followed her roaring acceptance speech in which she asked that all female nominees stand. “Look around, ladies and gentlemen, because we all have stories to tell and projects we need financed,” she said.It seems likely that if more people with bargaining power bring the inclusion rider to negotiations, then we’ll see an increasing number of women standing at future awards shows."

But the Times reported Tillerson took seven months deciding if he should spend the money, and when the agency finally asked for it, the fiscal year was almost over and the request denied.Another $60 million became available for the next fiscal year, but both State and the Department of Defense have been at loggerheads over how much money to send over. After media outlets, including the Times and Politico, began asking about the funding, the Pentagon said last Monday it would direct $40 million to the State Department sometime in April.The U.S. government also has vast resources and spends billions each year on cyberweapons, but those tools do little against trolling campaigns.Rather, State’s Global Engagement Center would use the funding to develop means to combat social media campaigns to influence voters. The Times notes the office could do so by crafting anti-propaganda projects, or amplifying pro-democracy voices.President Donald Trump has done little himself to combat Russian meddling. Rather, he’s moved to deny the influence of Moscow in his own election, despite many of the nation’s leading intelligence agencies saying otherwise.When Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted 13 Russians last month for such interference, Trump tweeted that his campaign “did nothing wrong” and once again emphasized that there was “no collusion!”Regardless of the president’s opinions, however, intelligence officials warned last month that Russia was using the internet once again to sow discord among American voters.“We expect Russia to continue using propaganda, social media, false-flag personas, sympathetic spokespeople and other means of influence to try to exacerbate social and political fissures in the United States,” Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, told the Senate in February. “There should be no doubt that Russia perceives its past efforts as successful and views the 2018 U.S. midterm elections as a potential target for Russian influence operations.”"

He told USA Today that he and author André Aciman, who wrote the 2007 novel on which the film was based, had already discussed specifics. “It’s going to happen five or six years afterwards,” he said. “It’s going to be a new movie, a different tone.”Stars Timothée Chalamet, who was nominated for Best Actor, and Armie Hammer would be back as star-crossed lovers Elio and Oliver, Guadagnino said. However, the setting may not be limited to Italy this time around. “They’re going to go around the world,” he said. Fans of “Call Me by Your Name,” which won the Oscar Sunday for Best Adapted Screenplay, have been buzzing about a potential sequel for some time. In January, Guadagnino said he wanted to expand the movie, which was set in 1983, into a “Before Sunrise”-like series. A follow up, the director said at the time, would tackle the HIV/AIDS epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s head on. “I think it’s going to be a very relevant part of the story,” Guadagnino told The Hollywood Reporter."

Security Council resolutions, is also concerned about a joint U.S.-South Korea military exercise, which it sees as preparation for war.South Korean officials have said the drill will start next month as planned, after being postponed for the Winter Olympics held last month in South Korea.The 10-member South Korean delegation, led by National Security Office head Chung Eui-yong, was greeted by North Korean officials after landing in Pyongyang, said Kim Eui-kyeom, a spokesman for South Korea’s presidential office.The North Koreans at the airport included Ri Son Gwon, chairman of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Country and Kim Yong Chol, who heads the United Front Department, the North Korean office responsible for handling inter-Korean affairs. Both visited South Korea last month during the Winter Olympics.The South Korean delegation was later invited to join Kim Jong Un at a dinner, the South Korean spokesman added.The South Korean officials are the most senior officials from the South to meet Kim Jong Un since he took power in late 2011 following the death of his father, Kim Jong Il.“We will deliver President Moon Jae-in’s wish to bring about denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and permanent peace by extending the goodwill and better inter-Korean relations created by the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics,” Chung said in South Korea before the delegation’s departure.The delegation hopes to speak to North Korean officials on starting a dialog between the North and the United States as well as other countries, the delegation leader said.Chung’s team includes National Intelligence Service chief Suh Hoon and Vice Unification Minister Chun Hae-sung.The delegation is expected to take part in another meeting set for early Tuesday, said a South Korean official who declined to be identified.The government hopes the visit will create “a positive atmosphere,” Unification Ministry spokesman Baik Tae-hyun told a regular briefing.Chung and Suh are due to fly to Washington later in the week to brief U.S. officials on their discussions in the North.Thawing relations between the Korean neighbors have prompted speculation about direct talks between Washington and Pyongyang after months of tension and exchanges of bellicose insults between Trump and Kim Jong Un fueled fears of war.North Korea has not carried out any weapons tests since late November, when it tested its largest intercontinental ballistic missile. Inter-Korean talks began after Kim Jong Un said in his New Year’s address that he wanted to engage the South.North Korea later sent athletes to the Olympics, as well as a high-ranking delegation that included Kim’s sister, Kim Yo Jong.Impoverished North Korea and the rich, democratic South are technically still at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.The North regularly threatens to destroy the South and its main ally, the United States, which stations 28,500 troops in the South, a legacy of the Korean War.“Neither sanctions nor provocations nor threats can ever undermine our position of a nuclear weapons state,” the North’s Rodong Sinmun newspaper said recently.“Hoping that the DPRK would abandon its nuclear programs is as foolish an act as trying to wish seas to get dried up,” it said, referring to itself by its official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.

Turing is now Vyera.In December 2015, Shkreli told Bloomberg Businessweek that he had bought the Wu-Tang Clan’s“Once Upon a Time in Shaolin” when the hip-hop group auctioned the sole copy of the album to the highest bidder. Bloomberg reported that he paid $2 million for it.Shkreli has also boasted of owning a Picasso painting.A jury found Shkreli guilty last August of securities fraud charges unrelated to Daraprim. They determined that he lied to investors about the performance of two hedge funds he ran, MSMB Capital and MSMB Healthcare. He also was found guilty of conspiring to manipulate the stock price of another drug company he founded, Retrophin Inc (RTRX.O).Shkreli’s lawyers have asked that he be sentenced to 12 to 18 months in prison. They argued in a court filing that a lenient sentence is warranted partly because the investors eventually came out ahead when Shkreli paid them in stock and cash from Retrophin.Matsumoto has already ruled that when Shkreli is sentenced, he will be held responsible for $10.4 million in losses, including all of the money his investors entrusted to his hedge funds. She said that regardless of the investors’ ultimate gains, Shkreli got their money in the first place through fraud.Although the $10.4 million loss will result in a higher recommended sentence under federal guidelines, Matsumoto is not required to follow those guidelines."

Such incidents fuel the widespread fear that students often bring guns to school. But there’s no way to tell if this is true. There is no good data.Because of lax reporting by schools and lax oversight by state and federal authorities — and despite federal law — it’s nearly impossible to say just how many students get caught taking firearms into public schools each year.When a student is caught with a gun at school, the 1994 Gun-Free Schools Act requires schools to report the incident to the school district, which is supposed to pass the information along to state education officials, who then are supposed to send it to the U.S. Department of Education. The idea behind the reporting requirement is to make it possible to detect trends and inform policymakers as they seek to address the problem.But much of the information on the Education Department’s website is either outdated or inconsistent with state data. The department did not follow up to multiple questions and requests from Stateline for new and more comprehensive data.In the past few years, school and state officials have not properly tracked deadly school shootings in Arizona and Colorado, and firearm-related school incidents in Maine. State education officials there say that while they collect statistics, they don’t enforce the reporting requirement.In Maine, Democratic state Sen. Rebecca Millett said she wants to require the state’s Education Department to submit gun incident information to the Legislature each year, so lawmakers can ensure that the state is tracking the information accurately and can use it to make policy.“We need to understand the nature of what we are facing,” she said.‘Grossly Underestimated’U.S. students were caught with a firearm at school at least 1,576 times during the 2015-16 school year, according to a federal database with information collected from states through the Gun-Free Schools Act.This data is incomplete, though. The federal numbers are lower than the numbers recorded by at least five states — Iowa, New Jersey, Maine, Maryland and Washington — in recent years, according to a Stateline review.In Iowa, 15 firearm incidents were recorded in 2015-16. Only one shows up in the federal database. Iowa education officials did not respond to a follow-up question about why the state and federal data are different.In Washington state, the federal data shows a decline from 162 firearm incidents in 2009-10 to 13 in 2015-16. But the state count shows 128 incidents in 2015-16, about the same as 2009-10, when there were 130 incidents. State education officials confirmed the state data is accurate.Mike Donlin, program supervisor for the school safety center at the Washington department of education, said he wasn’t sure why the numbers were different.Federal and state data grossly underestimate threats to schools, said Kenneth Trump, president of National School Safety and Security Services, an Ohio-based school safety consulting firm. With no nationally enforced reporting system, he said, schools’ reporting is a “goodwill effort.”There are a few carrots and absolutely no sticks for local school districts to give data to the states, Trump said.The best effort to track guns in schools might come at the local level, Trump said, but some school administrators might be reluctant. “There are some that believe that, ‘No data, no problem, but if there is data, we have to do something about it.’ ”School administrators may try to keep firearm incidents under wraps, Trump said, to protect the school’s image, or their own.“If their school comes in with numbers higher than a school on the other side of town,” he said, “those administrators may seem to be better at keeping the school safe, when in reality, they may have a less-safe school, they are just not honestly reporting.”The 1994 Gun-Free Schools Act also requires students who bring guns to school be expelled for at least a year in most cases, but some gun advocates say it isn’t the federal government’s place to make such judgments.States and local school systems should be the ones to decide whether students may bring guns to school, said Michael Hammond, legislative counsel at Gun Owners of America.“When I grew up in the 60s in an inner city high school in Kansas City, I was in ROTC,” Hammond said. “I was issued an M-1 semiautomatic rifle when I was 13 and would walk back and forth with it on the playground. No one thought I’d shoot up the school.”‘Quite Old’ DataThe U.S. Department of Education used to publish much more detailed annual reports, including how many times students were caught with guns, the related punishment, and the rate at which school systems in each state recorded the information. But the agency’s most recent comprehensive report covers the 2006-7 school year.“Unfortunately, the latest data we have is quite old,” said Jo Ann Webb, a department spokeswoman.In Arizona, the Department of Education hasn’t felt confident about its data for years, said Stefan Swiat, a department spokesman. The agency still receives information from schools, but it’s not complete.The last year the Arizona school system knew it was getting comprehensive information from school districts was 2009, he said. That’s because, for a few years, the state had federal funding for a school crime-tracking program that also allowed the state to require local school systems to submit the data.It’s crucial for the state to have comprehensive data so it can identify trends and have smart policy discussions, said Arizona state Rep. Daniel Hernandez, a Democrat.Hernandez, who is also a board member at his local school district in Tucson, said his school district tracks firearms seized at schools, but that other districts track it differently.Unlike other states, in Washington, state officials are fairly confident they are accurately tracking how many times students bring guns to school, said Donlin, with the state’s school safety center. State officials comb through the statistics looking for trends and spikes, such as when copycats come out after school shootings. They then work with school communities and law enforcement to mitigate future events.‘Watch Me Be Cool Today’High school students clearly are bringing guns to schools at a much higher rate than is characterized by the federal data, a national survey shows. About 4 percent of high school students say they brought a weapon to school at least once in the past month.Many times, school resource officers, sworn officers who work in schools, are the first to hear about guns on school grounds, said Mac Hardy, director of operations for the National Association of School Resource Officers.Students hear about rumors and social media posts and report it to the officers, Hardy said. Many times, students will bring a gun to school if they are being bullied, to appear tough to their tormentor. Most of the time, the gun is not loaded, or it’s a replica gun, such as an airsoft gun, he said, but it still creates a dangerous situation.In Washington state, Donlin said sometimes students bring firearms to school for innocent reasons; perhaps they went hunting and forgot to take the gun out of the car. But there has been a recent uptick in students bringing guns for more troublesome reasons.“Sometimes it’s real,” he said of the threats. “Sometimes it’s, ‘Watch me be cool today,’ or ‘I have a test tomorrow, it’s a good time to pull out my gun trick.’ ”School communities need to act on these incidents, he said.“ ‘See something say something’ is a simple thing to say, but it can be really effective,” Donlin said. “And the next step is: Do something — don’t just let it slip by.” Stateline staff writer Matt Vasilogambros contributed to this report.Stateline home pageSign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research "

That was down 19.5 percent from 32.9 million viewers who watched the show last year, and fell beneath the previous low of 32 million in 2008.Producers were wary of a potential drop in viewership leading up to the Oscars, saying they hoped the award show would focus on films ― and not on politics ― even amid a months-long conversation about sexual misconduct in the movie industry.“The Oscars should be a spectacle. Fun and funny and great performances,” Jennifer Todd, a producer of the Academy Awards, told The New York Times in February. “It should also be a giant commercial for the movie business, which we all need to keep going.” Come Sunday night, host Jimmy Kimmel and a number of other stars paid tribute to the Me Too, Time’s Up, and Never Again movements. Some touched on gender inequality, immigration and gun control, though those topics rarely took center stage. According to some critics, the award show is just too long and too predictable. The Oscars dragged on for nearly four hours this year, even with the enticement of a free jet ski for the winner who delivered the shortest speech. Others say the Oscars seem increasingly trivial in a world wrought by violence and inequality.“This year’s awards come amid rising oceans, sexual abuse scandals and slain schoolchildren. Our country is divided; our president is a Twitter fiend. Our immigrants feel unwelcome and our working poor can’t afford healthcare. We face nuclear threats from multiple sides. We are sinking deeper into debt and have stumbled badly in the eyes of the world,” wrote film writer Jeffrey Fleishman in an op-ed for the Los Angeles Times. “The Oscars seem insignificant amid the clamor.”A representative for ABC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.Television viewership has declined in recent years, affecting other large, live events in addition to the Oscars. The Grammy Awards, which aired in January, attracted just over 26 million viewers, marking its smallest audience in over a decade. The following month, roughly 103.4 million viewers tuned in to watched the Super Bowl ― a decline of 7 percent from the previous year."

The actor was essentially a shoo-in to win the Best Actor award after picking up trophies at the Golden Globes, BAFTAs and Screen Actors Guild Awards in the past few months. He beat out competition like Daniel Kaluuya in “Get Out” and Timothée Chalamet in “Call Me By Your Name,” who was set become the youngest Best Actor honoree in almost 80 years.“Movies, such is their power, captivated a young man from south London and gave him a dream,” he said onstage in his acceptance speech before thanking his mother. “Put the kettle on, I’m bringing Oscar home.”Oldman’s win arrives amid a growing backlash against the actor, as allegations of domestic violence against him have resurfaced. The English actor was accused of choking and beating his then-wife Donya Fiorentino in 2001 with a telephone while their young children watched.The police investigated Fiorentino’s claims and charges were never filed, with Oldman describing her account as “replete with lies, innuendos and half-truths.”People watching along immediately reacted on Twitter to Oldman’s win, as well as to accused rapist Kobe Bryant’s, who picked up an Oscar for Best Animated Short Film. “Darkest Hour,” a true story set during the start of World War II, also picked up awards for Best Sound Editing and Mixing at the ceremony. Oldman was previously nominated for his turn in “Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy” in 2012."

Fans found out Khloe Kardashian and Tristan Thompson will welcome a daughter during a pre-taped episode of “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” on Sunday. Khloe received the baby news while she was on a trip with Kourtney and Kim. Little sister Kylie called to deliver the news from Khloe’s doctor.Khloe was stunned to find out that she was having a girl. “I don’t feel like I’m having a girl,” the 33-year-old said on the show crinkling up her face. “I don’t feel like I’m having a girl at all. I’m, like, in a state of shock.” Kim comforted her younger sister, telling her, “It’s OK, I cried when I found out North was going to be a girl too.” Khloe later said she was so shocked simply because she was “convinced” she was having a boy. “When you have your mind made up as to what you’re having — like everyone told me you’re going to feel what you’re having and you’ll just kind of know,” she said, according to E! “And then when you find out it’s the complete opposite, it’s just a shock. I just was convinced that I was having a boy, so to be having a girl it’s just like, ‘OK, that wasn’t what I thought was going on.’”On Sunday, Khloe tweeted that her hormones had something to do with her reaction.She also said she was excited that her little girl will get the chance to grow up with Kim’s newborn daughter, Chicago, and Kylie’s baby, Stormi.The reality star admitted to her followers that she still doesn’t know what she’s going to name her daughter.Kardashian and Thompson, an NBA player for the Cleveland Cavaliers, first sparked dating rumors in August 2016 and made their relationship official that fall. They confirmed that they were welcoming a child together in December 2017. “My greatest dream realized! We are having a baby!” Kardashian wrote on Instagram at the time. “I had been waiting and wondering but God had a plan all along. He knew what He was doing. I simply had to trust in Him and be patient. I still at times can’t believe that our love created life!” Khloe reportedly has a few more weeks until she is supposed to give birth. We’ll keep refreshing Twitter and Instagram until then."

But noooooo. This was Grade-A dissing.Spacey, of course, did not attend the Academy Awards. He faces multiple accusations of sexual misconduct, and was replaced by Plummer in reshoots after the film “All The Money In The World” was finished.

On the occasion of the 90th Academy Awards, host Jimmy Kimmel invited several stars ― including Gal Gadot, Emily Blunt, Lupita Nyong’o, Armie Hammer and Ansel Elgort ― to duck out of the Dolby Theatre and join him in crashing a screening of “A Wrinkle in Time” at a neighboring cinema. They arrived with baskets full of Red Vines and launchers full of hot dogs, ready to shower a crowd of ecstatically grateful proles with snacks and, more crucially, proximity to their celebrité.The moviegoers, in fact, reacted with tepid applause as their film was interrupted by a group of self-satisfied actors in couture bearing junk food they likely wouldn’t deign to sully their own digestive tracts with. “This is so much better than the Oscars!” shouted Gadot, who certainly could have gone to a “Wrinkle in Time” screening instead of the Oscars if she wished.The jaunt was framed as a thank you to moviegoers, we heroic consumers without whose ticket-purchasing prowess Gadot and Elgort would be naught but normies themselves. But I don’t watch movies to make Gadot and Elgort happy, or to make them rich, or to enable them to spend four hours feting their craft and perfect cheekbones on national television each year. Much like celebrities and other humans, I do things out of self-interest, without any thought as to how I’m serving the rich and famous. A skit that suggests celebrities view us as saintly but pathetic serfs isn’t an act of gratitude ― it’s an act of smug condescension. The bit, which seemed to go on for days, actually took up at least four and a half minutes of screen time and was certainly less enjoyable to watch than a beaming sound editor experiencing the pinnacle of his Hollywood career. That wasn’t even the only casually snobbish bit of the night. Kimmel also made a running gag of offering a prize to the shortest speech-giver, as an incentive to be timely. The prize: a Jet Ski and a getaway to Arizona’s Lake Havasu. Oscars attendees roared with laughter as a promo reel played for Lake Havasu, a perfectly lovely vacation spot.

Stars packed into the Dolby Theater in Los Angeles on Sunday for the 90th Academy Awards. Hosted for a second time by late-night favorite Jimmy Kimmel, this year’s ceremony was the first Oscars to air in the wake of Hollywood’s recent reckoning with sexual harassment and assault.Guillermo del Toro’s ravishing romantic fantasy “The Shape of Water” led the pack with 13 nominations, and ended the night with four wins, including Best Director and Best Picture. It was the first sci-fi movie ever to win the award. The genre-defying “Get Out,” certainly the most timely of the films up for Best Picture, also scored four nominations. Director Jordan Peele became the first black director to win for Best Original Screenplay.Not every award was groundbreaking, though. Timothée Chalamet failed to upset the expected winner, actor Gary Oldman, for his star turn in the sumptuous “Call Me By Your Name.” The 22-year-old would have been the youngest Best Actor honoree in almost 80 years.Movie fans also had their eyes out for the typically male-dominated Best Director category ― shoutout to Natalie Portman ― which included relative newcomers Peele and Greta Gerwig competing against industry stalwarts like Steven Spielberg and Paul Thomas Anderson. The award ultimately went to del Toro.Check out the complete list of winners below.

Bucci had been Kansas resident for a few years, and decided to use her trip to the DMV as an opportunity to register to vote while she was there.Bucci didn’t need to prove she was a citizen to renew her license (Kansas says an expiring license is good enough). But shortly after she registered, she received a phone call and a letter in the mail saying her voter registration was still pending because she hadn’t proved she was a citizen. Bucci, who was born in Maryland, didn’t have a copy of her birth certificate or any of the other documents, like a passport, to prove she was a citizen. She was working a minimum wage job at a correctional facility at the time and couldn’t afford the $20 to get her birth certificate from Maryland. Because she couldn’t prove she was a citizen, Kansas kicked her off the voting rolls.Earlier in the same year that Bucci registered, Kansas implemented a law requiring people to prove their citizenship when they register to vote. Spearheaded by Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R), officials said it was necessary to prevent noncitizens from getting on the voting rolls. Kobach put anyone who didn’t prove they were a citizen on a “suspense list” and purged them from the rolls if they couldn’t prove it, including Bucci.In 2016, Bucci joined five other Kansans to sue Kobach and challenge the law. They say the law is unnecessarily restrictive and violates the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), a 1993 law that requires states to offer people the opportunity to register at DMVs and other state agencies. The NVRA says when someone registers to vote at the DMV, the state can only ask people for the minimum amount of information necessary to assess whether they’re eligible.While the Kansas law might not pose a hurdle to anyone with easy access to a passport or other proof of citizenship documents, the plaintiffs say that it targets young people, who may move around a lot, as well as the poor and minorities who don’t have access to proof of citizenship documents or can’t pay to get them. Arizona, Georgia and Alabama have also sought to impose proof of citizenship requirements on new voters.Trial in the case begins Tuesday in Kansas City. The Kansas law has been on hold since 2016, when a federal judge stepped in to issue a temporary injunction ordering Kobach to register 18,000 people who had tried to register at the DMV but failed to prove their citizenship. At the time of the judge’s ruling, there were over 32,000 people in the state whose registration, like Bucci’s, was in limbo. A federal appeals court upheld the judge’s decision, saying Kansas and Kobach needed to show the current practice of allowing people to swear they were citizens under penalty of perjury wasn’t doing enough to prevent noncitizens from voting.The case, which will determine whether Kansas can continue to block tens of thousands of people from registering to vote if they can’t prove their citizenship, hinges on the question at the center of the national debate over voting restrictions: Is there enough evidence of noncitizens registering to vote to justify a law that imposes a substantial hurdle to registering? Kobach has long been one of the loudest voices arguing that widespread voter fraud is a problem, a claim that several studies and investigations have debunked. Kobach, whom President Donald Trump picked to lead a now defunct commission to investigate voter fraud, will now have to prove his claims in a court of law.Dale Ho, the director of the voting rights project at the ACLU, which is representing the plaintiffs, said it was “not an accident” that Kobach was at the center of the lawsuit.“This could really be in a lot of ways the case where we really put the evidence of fraud on trial in this country,” he said. “You have the nation’s chief purveyor of fraud talking about this. Well now he’s going to have to try and prove it in court, not on Fox News.”Kobach has tried hard to get around the NVRA requirements for what officials can ask about when someone tries to register to vote. He unsuccessfully sought to amend the federal voter registration requirements to allow states to ask about proof of citizenship. The morning after the 2016 election, Kobach wrote to a Trump transition official and said he was already working on an amendment to NVRA that would make it acceptable for states to ask people to prove they were citizens when they registered to vote. Later that month, Kobach met with Trump and brought a memo recommending changing NVRA to allow states to ask for proof of citizenship. Shortly after that meeting, Trump tweeted that he would have won the popular vote had it not been for illegal votes and would later go on to say that 3 to 5 million people voted illegally in the election. The White House has failed to substantiate that claim, but has publicly pointed to Kobach as someone who can.Kobach has suggested that 127 noncitizens in Kansas registered or attempted to register to vote in the state anytime before 2013, instances which he said diluted a legitimate voter’s ballot. That 127 number represents less than 0.01 percent of the total number of voters in Kansas. But Kobach has said there could be more than 18,000 noncitizens on the rolls. He plans to offer a series of experts during the trial to support the claim. The ACLU says roughly one in seven voters in Kansas were blocked from voting because of the proof of citizenship law between 2013 and 2016. Because noncitizen attempts to register in the state are so rare, Ho says the Kansas law is like “taking a bazooka to a fly.”For people who have easy access to a passport or birth certificate, Ho acknowledged it can be difficult to see how a proof of citizenship requirement is unfairly restrictive. But the fact that so many voters were blocked, Ho said, is evidence of just how burdensome the law is. “If seven people fail to comply with this law, then you’d say, ‘Well come on guys, get your act together,’” he said. “But it’s one out of every seven registrants in the state. That tells you that it’s a problem.”Kobach has said that one of the reasons proof of citizenship isn’t burdensome is because people have to prove they’re a citizen when they apply to get a license. But in its complaint, the ACLU said there were thousands of people in Kansas who registered when getting their license for the first time, but failed to make it onto the rolls. Kobach, the ACLU says, wasn’t making an effort to match voter registration records with DMV records, and required people to submit proof of citizenship a second time to register to vote. NVRA prohibits states from making that kind of duplicative request, according to the ACLU.Last year, the Kansas Advisory Committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights issed a deeply critical analysis of the proof of citizenship law. They noted that there was a correlation between where African-American voters lived and areas where high numbers of people who were on Kobach’s suspense list. The commission compared the fees people have to pay to get documents to a “poll tax” and recommended that the Department of Justice review whether it violated federal law, including the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Kobach, who is running for Kansas governor, is taking the unusual step of representing himself in the case. He has already been sanctioned with a $1,000 fine in the case for misleading the court about the contents of the documents he brought to his November 2016 meeting with Trump. Kobach, who declined to be interviewed through a spokeswoman, has staunchly defended the proof of citizenship law and has indicated in court documents that he will defend it all the way to the United States Supreme Court (though his term ends in 2019 and he is not seeking reelection).“The ACLU has declared war on election security laws like ours in Kansas. This war is something that is outrageous,” he said in an interview with Fox News in February. “They’re making ridiculous arguments like it’s an unconstitutional burden for you to reach into your file cabinet at home and find your birth certificate.” This story has been updated to include a more exact figure for the percentage of noncitizens that Kobach estimated had voted in Kansas prior to 2013."

Mangiacapra’s dossier reportedly contains WhatsApp texts and photos that offer evidence that Catholic clergy members were interested in gay sex.In a statement, Sepe said that none of the priests on Mangiacapra’s list were part of the Diocese of Naples. The cardinal forwarded the file to the Vatican because “those who have erred must pay the price, and be helped to repent for the harm done.” Mangiacapra describes himself as a “gay escort,” according to the Associated Press. The list he compiled, of 34 priests and six seminarians, does not involve any accounts of sex with minors. “We’re talking about sins, not crimes,” Mangiacapra said, according to the diocesan statement.The Roman Catholic Church maintains that “homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered” and teaches that LGBTQ Catholics are “called to chastity.” All ordained ministers of the church are expected to be celibate, although Eastern Catholic churches have different standards for priests.Despite the church’s unchanging stance on homosexuality, some Vatican observers claim that many secretly gay clergy do work for the Catholic Church. The gay priests reportedly form alliances, leading to rumors of a “gay lobby,” an informal network of priests who keep each others’ secrets and help influence each others’ careers.According to the AP, Mangiacapra came forward with his list because he wanted to expose the priests’ alleged hypocrisy."

The first since the Golden Globes, when Hollywood’s most famous and best-dressed wore pins, discussed legal funds and said that time was up, this time would be different, forget about all that other stuff ― so sorry about the past.Host Jimmy Kimmel addressed the industry’s harassment problem head-on in his monologue. Ashley Judd, Salma Hayek, and Annabella Sciorra ― three Weinstein accusers ― were allowed to stand together on stage and speak briefly and compactly about the Me Too movement, a polite nod to the changing world.Yet, there they were, the accused rapist and the alleged wife beater. First, former NBA star Kobe Bryant accepted the award for Best Animated Short to raucous applause, while Mark Hamill, presenting the award, screamed “KOBEEEEEE” as if he’d just hit a game-winner in his backyard. Then, Gary Oldman, whose now ex-wife once accused him of hitting her with a phone, stood before the Academy with the award for Best Actor in hand. Bryant and Oldman had won for two projects so typical of the industry, so consonant with the basic corporate desires of powerful producers that they’re not clichéd so much as intrinsic, like a strand of DNA.A John Williams-scored ode to the beauty of sports, and a World War II tale of perseverance in the face of the growing Nazi threat — it doesn’t get more Hollywood than that.Bryant’s short film, “Dear Basketball,” which sets a poem he wrote during his final season in the NBA to orchestral music and some so-so animation, is not great. It’s not even good. Or, as IndieWire’s Chris O’Falt put it after “Dear Basketball” received a nomination, “In my opinion, it is the worst short film I have ever seen nominated for an Academy Award.”But it does two things well. For one, it plays right into Hollywood’s long-documented love of overly sentimental sports narratives meant to unveil something larger about life, or adversity, or acceptance, or something (“I gave you my heart / Because it came with so much more”). It also stars the most beloved sports star in the Los Angeles area. Take the two together and you have a film tailor-made for a middle-aged white man in Los Angeles, otherwise known as a typical Academy voter.“Darkest Hour” was better, and Gary Oldman made for an impressive and impressively made-up WWII-era Winston Churchill. Films about the war have become so stupendously synonymous with the Academy Awards that Kate Winslet once joked about it in a 2005 episode of the HBO show “Extras.” Dressed up like a nun who was sheltering Jews, she tells Ricky Gervais’ character, “I’m doing it because I’ve noticed that if you do a film about the Holocaust, you’re guaranteed an Oscar.” And a few years later, Winslet would in fact win one for her role in the Holocaust film “The Reader.”For all the various misdeeds of powerful men that have been unearthed in the months since Weinstein became known as the walking allegation that he is, the fundamental structures of power remain firmly in place in Hollywood. Last year, the percentage of female protagonists in Hollywood movies was down and the percentage of directors of color basically flatlined. Female directors made far below 10 percent of the highest-grossing films.That power imbalance was reflected in the auditorium on Sunday. After Frances McDormand asked the female nominees in the room to stand during her own acceptance speech for Best Actress, The New York Times’ Jodi Kantor, who broke the Weinstein story wide open with Megan Twohey, wrote, “The most striking thing, here in the room, about watching the female nominees stand? There were so few of them.”Maybe men will be a bit more careful now, but the thrust of the night’s biggest moment, Frances McDormand’s Best Actress acceptance speech, was that actual power would have to be wrested away from the lords of our status quo.Until then, until the way that movies are concocted, greenlit, produced and pushed out is changed, Hollywood will continue to have nights like Sunday — nights when people who have been accused of terrible things can win with recycled or terrible ideas amid an apparent general enwokening.Navigating new moral imperatives in a fundamentally unchanging industry is a messy business. It is the kind of thing that causes Aziz Ansari to skip out on the SAG Awards while Ryan Seacrest ends up on air interviewing stars on the red carpet Sunday night. Arbitrary barometers end up deciding which accused bad men are fine now, and which are not. Was the accusation a while ago? How many were there? Well, he does seem a bit better now, more mature, doesn’t he? And I did love that one movie.It’s been a year since the Academy awkwardly handed a Best Actor award to Casey Affleck, accused sexual harasser, for his performance in “Manchester by the Sea,” and quite obviously, no one has figured out anything resembling a road map for these sort of things. Had Bryant, for example, come to “understand how [his accuser] feels that she did not consent to this encounter” in the last five years, rather than when he wrote those words roughly a decade and a half ago, it would be hard to imagine him on stage last night. (A judge ultimately dismissed the charge against Bryant after his accuser refused to testify; she and Bryant later reached a settlement after she filed a separate civil lawsuit.) The same could be said of Oldman, whose now-ex wife said this of Hollywood’s favorite Churchill near the start of the century:As I picked up the phone to call the police, Gary put his hand on my neck and squeezed. I backed away, with the phone receiver in my hand. I tried to dial 911. Gary grabbed the phone receiver from my hand, and hit me in the face with the telephone receiver three or four times. Both of the children were crying.Oldman described the allegations as “replete with lies, innuendos and half-truths” and police never pressed charges. What is not up for debate is that he followed that up with an impassioned defense of Mel Gibson and his anti-Semitic rant in a 2014 Playboy interview. “The policeman who arrested him has never used the word ‘nigger’ or ‘that fucking Jew?’” Oldman wondered aloud, in front of a reporter. “He got drunk and said a few things, but we’ve all said those things.”After Sunday’s Oscars, Oldman’s ex-wife told TMZ, “Congratulations, Gary and congratulations to the Academy for awarding not one but two abusers with Oscars. I thought we had evolved. What happened to the #MeToo movement?”That both men won, that the Academy deemed Bryant and Oldman acceptable enough to honor with an award, speaks to the essential traditionalism of Hollywood. The alleged bad men got their Oscars because they made movies so in the vein of what Hollywood has always done that their baggage could easily be dismissed. Pander to the industry’s immutable tastes — a fight for love and glory, a case of do or die — and whatever new critical faculties it seems to have acquired all fall apart.For all the talk of Hollywood remaking itself, Sunday’s show was a backward-looking and deeply conservative affair, down to its very interstices. There were Glenn Miller songs throughout, the last an old wartime standard made famous by the Andrews Sisters. “Don’t sit under that apple tree with anyone else but me,” goes the lyric, a soldier pleading for fidelity from an old flame."

It’s certainly not the dullest outcome that could have occurred at Sunday’s awards. “The Shape of Water” found itself in a heady position throughout the season. Based on the nebulous mix of horserace bellwethers ― precursor accolades, campaign machinations, box-office figures, media buzz ― it seemed Guillermo del Toro’s film lagged behind “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,” the Martin McDonagh dramedy whose muddy racial politics didn’t prevent it from netting the Screen Actors Guild Award, Golden Globe and BAFTA. Meanwhile, “Get Out,” “Dunkirk” and “Lady Bird” were considered potential spoilers, each representing a distinct idea about where Hollywood stands right now and where it is headed.Such is the agony and ecstasy of Oscar season: As self-indulgent and frivolous as the whole affair can be, there is, for better and worse, a political substance behind the grand foxtrot toward Best Picture. It’s perhaps American popular culture’s most transparent statement about itself. “This is the movie we’re the most proud to have made ― its values reflect our values,” some 7,000 Hollywood constituents collectively say.By comparison, “Get Out” was the academy’s most transgressive option, both in terms of its genre (a horror-comedy hybrid) and its themes (racist white suburbanites touting liberal ideals turn out to be the villains); no film like it has won in the Oscars’ 90-year history. “Lady Bird” offered a feminist vote, proving that pleasant coming-of-age movies about girls are just as important as World War II epics (“Dunkirk,” “Darkest Hour”) and polished Steven Spielberg productions (“The Post”). “Call Me By Your Name” would have signaled that, yes, a so-called gay movie can in fact win this award two years in a row. “The Shape of Water” had none of those distinguishing medals to trumpet. Instead, it’s the year’s happy medium. It’s the nominee that fits safely inside Hollywood’s current narrative: Deeply rooted power structures are being excavated and abusers cast aside, but tangible progress will occur only in increments. We aren’t ready to let a sociopolitically conscious crowd-pleaser like “Get Out” take the big kahuna, but we will valorize an old-fashioned adventure sprinkled with queer undertones otherwise summarized via the rallying cry “love is love.” Because, again, a mute woman (Sally Hawkins) fucks a godly fish-man (Doug Jones), and we swoon with the same emotional heft once devoted to “Titanic,” “West Side Story” and “Casablanca” ― all (deserving) Best Picture winners of yore. What a seemingly repulsive concept, brought to life in the dreamiest of fairytales and packaged for uncynical audiences willing to embrace such lore. Not bad for a fable about otherness.It makes all too much sense, really, that “The Shape of Water” edged out more polarizing fare like “Three Billboards” and “Get Out.” If “Moonlight” was tasked last year with the somewhat unfair burden of representing Trumpian resistance, “Water” is the movie that sends us gliding into the future without making too pointed a statement along the way. The media spent a lot of energy picking apart the meaning of “Three Billboards,” so much so that a supposed backlash lit up the internet. And when Vox, Vulture, CNN, USA Today and Vanity Fair are all narrativizing a polarization that mostly exists among film critics and Twitter pundits, it sure can seem real. But I don’t believe that’s why “Billboards” lost on Sunday, nor could I believe that certain criticisms of Hawkins’ disabled protagonist would have cost “The Shape of Water” had it not won. The academy doesn’t care whether anyone online is angry because Sam Rockwell’s racist cop got a redemption arc. They do, however, care whether a movie has something concrete to say, because its ability to say something succinctly and entertainingly reflects the quality of its filmmaking.With recent diversity initiatives that have broadened the group’s membership to include more women and young voters of color, we’re looking at a savvier academy than the one that thought “Crash” tackled America’s social ills. “Three Billboards” substituted mayhem for nuance, and its wishy-washy messaging made it inferior to the charm of “The Shape of Water,” in which, yep, a mute woman who feels unseen fucks a fish-man unfamiliar with the concept of love. Voters didn’t need any mass-media backlash to point them away from “Three Billboards”; all they needed was the compassion embedded in del Toro’s story.As we barrel toward the 2020s with “Spotlight,” “Moonlight” and “The Shape of Water” claiming the most recent Best Picture victories, it seems the days of regressive Oscar darlings are behind us. This is, after all, the first winner since “Million Dollar Baby” 13 years ago to feature a female lead.

But the deal announced by Gov. Jim Justice (R) earlier this week ― and the one that the West Virginia House of Delegates had overwhelmingly approved in order to end the work stoppage ― would have given teachers and other school employees a 5 percent raise and state employees a 3 percent raise.Unions representing school employees weren’t happy with the Senate’s decision to split the difference on raises. If the numbers proposed by Gov. Justice were going to be changed, they said they wanted all state workers brought up to a 5 percent pay hike. In a joint statement, the unions said, “You do not equalize pay for different groups by simply taking away from one and passing it to another. The purpose of this is clear ― to divide us and pit us against each other.”They called on protesters to fill the halls of the state capitol in Charleston again next week: “All public schools will be closed again on Monday and remain closed until the Senate honors the agreement that was made.”Teachers and other school personnel began their walkout on Feb. 22, closing schools in all 55 of the state’s counties in an unprecedented show of solidarity. It was the first teachers strike of its kind to hit the state in nearly 30 years. Workers are demanding that the state curb their rising health insurance costs and give them significant pay hikes after years of stagnant wages. Teachers haven’t seen an across-the-board raise since 2014, and increasing health premiums have caused some workers’ take-home pay to decrease. West Virginia ranks 48th out of 50 states and the District of Columbia in teacher pay, according to the National Education Association.On Tuesday, it seemed the strike might be resolved when Justice announced his pay raise plan alongside union leaders. But many rank-and-file workers didn’t trust that Justice had the necessary votes, and they decided to continue the strike until a resolution was guaranteed. Their concerns were well justified. Republican state senators apparently were not onboard with the plan that the governor announced. After it was passed by the House, they amended the bill so that the teachers’ pay hike would be dropped to 4 percent, all but guaranteeing that the unions would reject it. The late Saturday night at the capitol came with some added drama. At first, senators accidentally passed a bill with language giving teachers the 5 percent raise they did not intend to give them.The lawmakers had to go through several procedural steps to recall the bill, amend it to a 4 percent raise and pass it again.The state Senate and House will have to go to conference next week to reconcile the two different pay raises they’ve passed."

News shouldn't have Ryan Seacrest as part of its Oscars coverage.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a9c4cc02000007d06eb0956.jpeg?cache=x544uYkIA4&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Me Too movement founder Tarana Burke is speaking out against E! News’ decision to continue having Ryan Seacrest spearhead its Academy Awards red carpet coverage despite recent sexual misconduct allegations against him. The decision, she told Variety in a story published Sunday, is unfair to actresses who will have to decide whether to cooperate with his interview efforts at tonight’s telecast.“We shouldn’t have to make those choices of, ‘Do we or don’t we?’” said Burke, whose campaign exploded last fall as dozens of women in Hollywood came forward with stories of sexual harassment and abuse they’ve faced working in the entertainment industry. “This is not about his guilt or innocence,” Burke said. “It’s about there being an accusation that’s alive, and until they sort [it] out, it’s really on E! News and shouldn’t be on us. … It will let us know where they stand in terms of how respectful E! News is of this issue ― and of women.”In a story published last week, Seacrest’s former personal stylist told Variety that the E! host sexually harassed and assaulted her over a period of seven years. The stylist, Suzie Hardy, said the network fired her in 2013 after she reported her allegations to the E! human resources department. Seacrest has denied the accusations, and E! said last week that an independent third party carried out a comprehensive, two-month investigation that cleared his name of any wrongdoing. But those advocating for fairer treatment of women in Hollywood may have other reasons to stay clear of E! and Seacrest on the red carpet.In December, then-E! host Catt Sadler announced she was leaving the network, largely because she was only being paid half the salary of her male co-star and her requests for a raise were denied once she discovered that. Last week, a former producer at E! filed a claim with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission stating she was unfairly terminated because she allowed a clip of a celebrity being critical of the network’s handling of the Sadler matter to air during the network’s Golden Globes red carpet show in January."

Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said Sunday “if it’s true” that White House senior adviser Jared Kushner swayed U.S. foreign policy against Qatar for personal financial reasons, he “has to go.”“If it’s true, it’s damning. If it’s true, Jared Kushner has to go,” Murphy, a prominent voice on foreign policy, said of President Donald Trump’s son-in-law on ABC News’ “This Week with George Stephanopoulos.”The Intercept reported on Friday that representatives of Kushner Companies, including Kushner’s father, Charles Kushner, met with Qatari Finance Minister Ali Sharif Al Emadi in New York in April in a bid to secure Qatari financing for the firm’s distressed signature property, 666 5th Avenue. There was a follow-up meeting between Kushner Companies representatives and Qatari officials the following day. But a deal never materialized.Then, in early June, a coalition of nations led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates abruptly severed diplomatic relations with Qatar. They proceeded to blockade the small, natural gas-rich nation, ostensibly in retaliation for Qatar’s support of islamist movements abroad and cordial relationship with Iran. The blockade remains in effect.Trump surprised many in the diplomatic community by initially backing the Saudis and Emiratis so whole-heartedly. Qatar, a longtime American partner, is home to a key strategic base for the U.S. military in the Middle East where thousands of troops are deployed.“We could not understand why the Trump administration was so firmly taking the Saudis’ side in this dispute between the Saudis, the Emiratis and Qatar, because the United States has very important interests in Qatar,” Murphy said Sunday.Murphy noted the large U.S. troop presence in Qatar.“To so firmly take the side of the Saudis against the Qataris that could potentially result in the downward spiral of the Qatari economy put thousands of Americans at risk,” he said.Jared Kushner’s friendship with UAE Ambassador to the United States Yousef al-Otaiba and Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman raised suspicion at the time he had encouraged Trump to take a hard line against Qatar.News of the Kushner family’s attempts to gain Qatari financing for a family-owned property raises the prospect that Kushner advised the president to side with the Saudis and Emiratis for personal financial reasons. If verified, that should be grounds for Kushner’s ouster, Murphy said.“If the reason this administration put U.S. troops at risk in Qatar was to protect the Kushners’ financial interests, then that’s all the evidence you need to make some big changes in the White House,” he said.NBC News reported Friday that special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating whether Kushner’s business discussions with foreign powers during the presidential transition, well before his father’s April 2017 meeting, later influenced American foreign policy. In addition to Qatari representatives, Kushner met with figures from Turkey, Russia, China and the United Arab Emirates, according to the report.The potentially damaging revelations about Kushner surfaced during an already punishing week for the Trump relative and confidant. Kushner, who had enjoyed a temporary top-secret security clearance, saw his clearance downgraded by the White House to merely “secret.”Although the justification for the downgrade was not immediately clear, experts note that it was unusual for someone to have a temporary clearance for so long without receiving permanent access. The White House’s decision not to grant him a permanent security clearance likely sprang from intelligence agencies’ concerns that foreign governments have tried to influence him and that he initially failed to report his meetings with officials from those governments.Also speaking on “This Week,” former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R), a onetime Trump transition team chief, implied that Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump (who’s also a White House adviser), should consider stepping down from their posts for the good of the president. (As a United States attorney, Christie sent Kushner’s father to prison, which likely chilled his relationship with Jared.)Asked by Stephanopoulos whether Trump should fire Kushner, Christie responded, “The president’s going to have to make that judgment.” He went on to suggest that Kushner and Ivanka might do well to spare Trump the difficulty of spurning family members by volunteering their resignations.“The situation is made much worse by the fact that we have family members in the White House,” he said. “So for Jared and for Ivanka and for all the other members of the family who were involved in one way or the other, I think everybody’s got to focus on what’s best for the president.”"

But President Donald Trump might not let them.,2018-03-04,"Alex and Lisben Aguirre, foster parents and Dreamers.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a999aa82000002d00eb0798.jpeg?cache=BrdSdy2QTi&ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Last summer, a little girl with black hair and dimples came to live with Lisben and Alex Aguirre in their gray three-story home in northeast D.C. The Aguirres are foster parents — great ones, according to Maraldy Gutierrez, a social worker who places children with them — and the little girl called them mommy and daddy from the moment she met them. The Aguirres want to have biological children, too, and although Lisben has suffered a series of miscarriages, she recently had two surgeries she hopes will eventually allow her to carry a pregnancy to term. It should have been a good year. But the Aguirres are scared it will all fall apart. The married couple are recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, which allows nearly 700,000 undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children to temporarily stay and work without imminent fear of deportation. President Donald Trump rescinded DACA in September and told Congress to pass legislation to help recipients by March 5 ― a deadline that is about to go by without action. If Trump and lawmakers fail to reach an agreement, all of the so-called Dreamers could eventually lose their status. The Aguirres would be unable to work legally and could find themselves at risk of deportation, leaving behind the children they want to give a home.But for now, the Aguirres are trying to live normally. On weekdays, Lisben drives the little girl and a 17-year-old girl in their care to school near her job in the Capitol Hill neighborhood, where she cares for children for two families. The boy who lives with them, who just turned 18, goes to school at night. By the time Lisben leaves, Alex is long gone: He gets up at 4:30 a.m. so he can take a bus around 5 and make it to the breakfast and lunch shift at a Capitol Hill restaurant where he works as a waiter. He sometimes sees lawmakers there, and a few times has told them he’s a Dreamer and gotten hugs or promises to fight for him in return. So far, Congress hasn’t acted. All the Aguirres — and the social workers and children who depend on them — can do for now is pray, and keep on doing the best they can. “They are one of our most committed foster homes,” Gutierrez said. “I can’t think of a time that we have called them and they have said no.”The Aguirres were both born in Guatemala and came to the U.S. when they were 15 years old, but they didn’t meet until years later. Alex came here to work, hoping to send money back for his family. Lisben’s parents sent her to the U.S. after she ran away with her then-boyfriend, whom she later married. Lisben is now 35 and Alex is 36. The next years weren’t easy. Lisben’s first husband left her because they had trouble getting pregnant. Her next boyfriend hit her. He threatened to call Immigration and Customs Enforcement if she left him or told anyone about the abuse. One day, he hit her in the stomach so badly she had to see a doctor. She found out that she had been pregnant, but the blow caused her to suffer a miscarriage. The surgery to remove the fetus left her with scar tissue. She has had five miscarriages since.When Lisben met Alex at a karaoke bar around 2002, she wasn’t ready for a relationship. They didn’t start dating until more than a decade later, after running into each other at an immigration rally. Alex sent Lisben a Facebook message asking her to meet up one evening. She had just poured a glass of wine and was planning on a relaxing evening in, but decided to go out anyway. They wound up at karaoke again. They started hanging out more often, and by the fall of 2015, their friendship developed into a relationship. They got serious quickly. As their relationship progressed, Lisben decided to tell Alex she wasn’t sure she could have a baby. He reassured her he didn’t see her as any less of a woman and that if she couldn’t get pregnant, they’d build their family another way. Within two months, Alex and Lisben were engaged. They were married the following summer. That same year, Lisben was approved for DACA. Her new status meant she would finally be able to apply for positions with her nursing assistant and teaching assistant certifications. Alex received his in two years earlier.In September 2016, a woman from their church community suggested they become foster parents, arguing they could be enormously helpful to bilingual children in need of a home. Alex and Lisben decided to go for it.They went through months of screenings and trainings to become foster parents — and finally got their license and became foster parents last June.But before the Aguirres could take in foster kids, they needed a bigger place. They told the foster care agency that they would move, but Gutierrez didn’t expect them to act so quickly. It’s a struggle to find foster parents in D.C. at all in part because high rents make it difficult to find people with enough space to do it. The Aguirres first looked at two-bedroom apartments when a friend suggested they try to buy a house instead. They were surprised to find one they could afford, and with four bedrooms ― enough to take in three kids at a time. Alex felt he had finally accomplished the American dream. Thanks to years of hard work, he owned his own home. The couple’s framed foster care home license stands displayed on top of a glass bookcase in their new dining room. The lower shelves of the case are dedicated to wedding photos and religious paraphernalia.“I can say I made it,” he said. “We made it.” Taking in foster children changed Alex and Lisben. When they first met the little girl who embraced them as mommy and daddy, Alex cried. “I need them and they need me,” he said. “That fills the space in my heart to be a dad.” The Aguirres’ next dream is to have a baby or adopt. Lisben found out last month that she will need a third surgery to remove scar tissue from her uterus so she can successfully carry a child. If not, they’d like to look into adoption. But since Congress hasn’t passed any legislation to help Dreamers like the Aguirres, even though lawmakers in both parties say they want to, those plans are on hold. Multiple proposals, including Trump’s, failed in the Senate last month, and the House hasn’t even voted on bills to firm up DACA recipients’ status. The Trump administration is accepting renewal applications, but only because a court forced it to. Lisben applied to renew her DACA protections after the injunction and is waiting to be approved, while Alex’s permit is set to expire next year. They want a permanent fix. Now the Aguirres are afraid of having children, since their child would be a U.S. citizen and they would not. They wouldn’t want the baby to have to leave his or her native country should they lose DACA and need to leave. The failure to pass Dreamer legislation would also complicate their plans to adopt. “If we want to adopt, how can we adopt if they don’t pass the Dream Act?” Lisben said, referring to a bill that would grant Dreamers legal status. “We’re going to cut our dreams and the dreams of the kids who were born here, so it’s not fair for them and it’s not fair for us.”The Aguirres have a Plan B for if Congress fails to step in to help them. Neither wants to go back to Guatemala, where there are few job opportunities and they worry they’d be in danger as new arrivals back from the U.S. But maybe they could go to Canada or somewhere in Europe. For now, the U.S. doesn’t feel safe. Their house doesn’t have a peephole in the front door, and since they applied for DACA and became foster parents, the government is well aware of where they are, should Trump decide to target Dreamers for deportation. “They know where we live,” Lisben said. “That is one of our nightmares now but that’s not stopping us from what we’re doing. We’re giving our time, we’re giving our money, we’re giving our lives, we’re giving our hearts. We’re trying to make a better place for other people. We’re helping as much as we can.” "

All the Aguirres — and the social workers and children who depend on them — can do for now is pray, and keep on doing the best they can. “They are one of our most committed foster homes,” Gutierrez said. “I can’t think of a time that we have called them and they have said no.”The Aguirres were both born in Guatemala and came to the U.S. when they were 15 years old, but they didn’t meet until years later. Alex came here to work, hoping to send money back for his family. Lisben’s parents sent her to the U.S. after she ran away with her then-boyfriend, whom she later married. Lisben is now 35 and Alex is 36. The next years weren’t easy. Lisben’s first husband left her because they had trouble getting pregnant. Her next boyfriend hit her. He threatened to call Immigration and Customs Enforcement if she left him or told anyone about the abuse. One day, he hit her in the stomach so badly she had to see a doctor. She found out that she had been pregnant, but the blow caused her to suffer a miscarriage. The surgery to remove the fetus left her with scar tissue. She has had five miscarriages since.When Lisben met Alex at a karaoke bar around 2002, she wasn’t ready for a relationship. They didn’t start dating until more than a decade later, after running into each other at an immigration rally. Alex sent Lisben a Facebook message asking her to meet up one evening. She had just poured a glass of wine and was planning on a relaxing evening in, but decided to go out anyway. They wound up at karaoke again. They started hanging out more often, and by the fall of 2015, their friendship developed into a relationship. They got serious quickly. As their relationship progressed, Lisben decided to tell Alex she wasn’t sure she could have a baby. He reassured her he didn’t see her as any less of a woman and that if she couldn’t get pregnant, they’d build their family another way. Within two months, Alex and Lisben were engaged. They were married the following summer. That same year, Lisben was approved for DACA. Her new status meant she would finally be able to apply for positions with her nursing assistant and teaching assistant certifications. Alex received his in two years earlier.In September 2016, a woman from their church community suggested they become foster parents, arguing they could be enormously helpful to bilingual children in need of a home. Alex and Lisben decided to go for it.They went through months of screenings and trainings to become foster parents — and finally got their license and became foster parents last June.But before the Aguirres could take in foster kids, they needed a bigger place. They told the foster care agency that they would move, but Gutierrez didn’t expect them to act so quickly. It’s a struggle to find foster parents in D.C. at all in part because high rents make it difficult to find people with enough space to do it. The Aguirres first looked at two-bedroom apartments when a friend suggested they try to buy a house instead. They were surprised to find one they could afford, and with four bedrooms ― enough to take in three kids at a time. Alex felt he had finally accomplished the American dream. Thanks to years of hard work, he owned his own home. The couple’s framed foster care home license stands displayed on top of a glass bookcase in their new dining room. The lower shelves of the case are dedicated to wedding photos and religious paraphernalia.“I can say I made it,” he said. “We made it.” Taking in foster children changed Alex and Lisben. When they first met the little girl who embraced them as mommy and daddy, Alex cried. “I need them and they need me,” he said. “That fills the space in my heart to be a dad.” The Aguirres’ next dream is to have a baby or adopt. Lisben found out last month that she will need a third surgery to remove scar tissue from her uterus so she can successfully carry a child. If not, they’d like to look into adoption. But since Congress hasn’t passed any legislation to help Dreamers like the Aguirres, even though lawmakers in both parties say they want to, those plans are on hold. Multiple proposals, including Trump’s, failed in the Senate last month, and the House hasn’t even voted on bills to firm up DACA recipients’ status. The Trump administration is accepting renewal applications, but only because a court forced it to. Lisben applied to renew her DACA protections after the injunction and is waiting to be approved, while Alex’s permit is set to expire next year. They want a permanent fix. Now the Aguirres are afraid of having children, since their child would be a U.S. citizen and they would not. They wouldn’t want the baby to have to leave his or her native country should they lose DACA and need to leave. The failure to pass Dreamer legislation would also complicate their plans to adopt. “If we want to adopt, how can we adopt if they don’t pass the Dream Act?” Lisben said, referring to a bill that would grant Dreamers legal status. “We’re going to cut our dreams and the dreams of the kids who were born here, so it’s not fair for them and it’s not fair for us.”The Aguirres have a Plan B for if Congress fails to step in to help them. Neither wants to go back to Guatemala, where there are few job opportunities and they worry they’d be in danger as new arrivals back from the U.S. But maybe they could go to Canada or somewhere in Europe. For now, the U.S. doesn’t feel safe. Their house doesn’t have a peephole in the front door, and since they applied for DACA and became foster parents, the government is well aware of where they are, should Trump decide to target Dreamers for deportation. “They know where we live,” Lisben said. “That is one of our nightmares now but that’s not stopping us from what we’re doing. We’re giving our time, we’re giving our money, we’re giving our lives, we’re giving our hearts. We’re trying to make a better place for other people. We’re helping as much as we can.” "

Jay Inslee (D) for his signature. Inslee is expected to sign it, according to Tacoma’s News Tribune.Those found guilty of breaking the law could face fines, medical license revocation or suspension.Conversion therapy involving a minor is already banned in nine states ― California, Connecticut, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, Illinois, Vermont, New Mexico and Rhode Island ― as well as the District of Columbia. New Hampshire’s House of Representatives last month passed a similar bill that bans the practice. That bill is slated to go before the state’s Senate, which rejected a similar bill in January.Seattle, Washington’s largest city, also banned the practice in 2016.It’s estimated that 698,000 LGBTQ adults in the U.S. have received treatment to change their sexual orientation or gender at some point in their lives, according to a recent report by the Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Law and Public Policy at UCLA School of Law. Of that estimate, 350,000 received treatment as adolescents.In states that don’t have such protections, the report states that an estimated 20,000 LGBTQ minors will be affected by the practice.The Human Rights Campaign, a LGBTQ organization, celebrated the Washington Legislature’s decision and called upon Inslee to “sign this crucially important” bill.“Children across the Evergreen State deserve to live their lives authentically and should never be subjected to the abusive practice of so-called conversion therapy,” HRC Senior Vice President for Policy and Political Affairs JoDee Winterhof said."

He banked his treasure in the hearts of his friends.”British Prime Minister Theresa May led the tributes to the former athlete, who later became one of Europe’s leading neurologists and was made a knight.“Sir Roger Bannister was a great British sporting icon whose achievements were an inspiration to us all. He will be greatly missed,” she said on Twitter.The record-breaking run was on the Oxford University track during a local athletics meeting with only a few spectators witnessing the Englishman’s destruction of the myth that no human being could run so fast.Bannister made headlines around the world at the age of 25. His achievement opened the physical and psychological door for many other milers who have since beaten his time of three minutes 59.4 seconds.Roger Gilbert Bannister, born in Harrow, a London suburb, on March 23, 1929, was a shy, gangling medical student who preferred to be an oarsman rather than a runner.In 1946, when he went to Oxford, his great ambition was to row against Cambridge in the annual boat race on the Thames.But Bannister, who stood 1.8 meters tall and weighed only 68 kilograms, was told he was too light to make a first-rate oarsman.So he turned to running and his new ambition became to win the 1,500 meters at the Olympic Games in Helsinki in 1952.Bannister started a five-year build-up and in 1947 at the age of 17 at Oxford ran his first mile race, finishing second in a time of just over five minutes. Later that year he won the mile for Oxford against Cambridge in an athletics meeting.The world record was gradually being whittled down and a number of athletes were considered capable of crashing the four-minute barrier."

Bush during a speech to Republican donors on Saturday, calling the former president’s decision to invade Iraq in 2003 “the single worst decision ever made.”Trump, whose shifting position on the Iraq War is well-documented, said the decision was akin to “throwing a big fat brick into a hornet’s nest.” CNN first reported Trump’s remarks, delivered at a fundraiser at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. “Here we are, like the dummies of the world, because we had bad politicians running our country for a long time,” Trump said. He went on to mock fellow Republican Bush, sarcastically calling him a “real genius” over his decision to invade Iraq.He also scorned the CIA over its flawed information about Iraq dictator Saddam Hussein harboring weapons of mass destruction.“That turned out to be wonderful intelligence. Great intelligence agency there,” Trump joked. As CNN noted, Trump has used this faulty assessment about the WMDs to question the reliability of the U.S. intelligence community, particularly regarding its conclusions about Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election.Though Trump repeatedly insisted during his presidential campaign that he’d long been opposed to the Iraq War, even saying in June 2016 that he was among its “earliest” critics, the record suggests otherwise.In a much-reported exchange with with radio host Howard Stern in September 2002, Trump expressed tepid support for the war, saying “Yeah, I guess so” when asked if he supported the impending invasion of Iraq.In March 2003, one day after the invasion, Trump told Fox News that the conflict appeared to be “a tremendous success from a military standpoint.”Trump’s excoriation of Bush wasn’t the only part of his fundraiser speech that made headlines. He also praised Chinese President Xi Jinping’s recent power grab in his remarks.“He’s now president for life, president for life. And he’s great,” Trump said, referring to Beijing’s decision to scrap presidential term limits, setting the stage for Xi to rule indefinitely. “And look, he was able to do that. I think it’s great. Maybe we’ll have to give that a shot someday.” "

Then Republicans overturned it.In a rare Saturday morning session, the state lawmakers considered a short-term ban on the assault-style rifle used to slaughter 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, last month. Democratic lawmakers attempted to put the gun restriction into a bill, SB 7026, that would invest money in mental health and school safety programs.After the upper chamber debated for nearly an hour, Senate President Joe Negron (R) ruled that the amendment temporarily banning the sale of AR-15s had passed in an unrecorded voice vote, the Tampa Bay Times reported.A quarter-hour later, that ruling was overturned by a roll call vote of 21-17.Every Senate member who voted against the amendment was Republican. Just two Republicans, state Sens. Anitere Flores and Rene Garcia, crossed party lines to support 15 Democrats in favor of the measure. It wasn’t enough.State Sen. Kelli Stargel (R) argued that offering one’s “thoughts and prayers” in response to a shooting is a more effective way of curbing gun violence because an assault weapons ban wouldn’t prevent people from using things like explosives to harm others.“Thoughts and prayers are really the only thing that’s going to stop the evil from within the individual that is taking up their arms to do this type of massacre,” Stargel said.In his argument against the amendment, state Sen. David Simmons (R) compared not selling AR-15s to Adolf Hitler taking guns away from German citizens. The Anti-Defamation League has repeatedly blasted that kind of comparison.“It’s offensive for anyone to manipulate the history of the Holocaust to score political points,” the Jewish civil rights organization tweeted earlier this week at U.S. Rep. Don Young (R-Alaska), who had made the same argument as Simmons.Following the failure of the ban, Senate members held a moment of silence for the victims ― primarily children ― killed at the Parkland high school."

He was 75.His agent, Mitchell K. Stubbs, tweeted that he died of bladder cancer at his home in Newport, Ore.For his work on “M*A*S*H,” Stiers was twice Emmy nominated for outstanding supporting actor in a comedy or variety or music series, in 1981 and 1982, and he earned a third Emmy nomination for his performance in NBC miniseries “The First Olympics: Athens 1896″ as William Milligan Sloane, the founder of the U.S. Olympic Committee.The actor, with his educated, resonant intonations ― though he did not share Major Winchester’s Boston Brahmin accent ― was much in demand for narration and voiceover work, and for efforts as the narrator and as of Disney’s enormous hit animated film “Beauty and the Beast,” he shared a Grammy win for best recording for children and another nomination for album of the year.He voiced Dr. Jumba Jookiba, the evil genius who created Stitch, in 2002′s “Lilo & Stitch” and various spinoffs; once he became part of the Disney family, Stiers went on to do voicework on a large number of movies, made for TV or video content and videogames.In addition to serving as narrator and as the voice of Cogsworth in “Beauty and the Beast” in 1991, he voiced Governor Ratcliffe and Wiggins in Disney’s 1995 animated effort “Pocahontas” and voiced the Archdeacon in Disney’s “The Hunchback of Notre Dame.” He also contributed the voice of the grandfather for the English-language version of Hayao Miyazaki’s 1992 animation “Porco Rosso” and of Kamaji in Miyazki’s classic “Spirited Away” in 2001. From 2011-15 he recurred on Cartoon Network’s “Regular Show.”Indeed, it was his voice that earned him his first screen credit ― as the announcer in George Lucas’ 1971 film “THX 1138.”Stiers was also known for the eight Perry Mason TV movies he made between 1986-88 in which his prosecuting attorney invariably lost to Raymond Burr’s Mason, and more recently he had recurred on the USA Network series “The Dead Zone” from 2002-07 as the Rev. Eugene Purdy, the chief antagonist to star Anthony Michael Hall’s Johnny Smith.In addition Stiers worked repeatedly for director Woody Allen, appearing in “Shadows and Fog,” “Mighty Aphrodite,” “Everybody Says I Love You” and “Curse of the Jade Scorpion” (in which he played a mysterious hypnotist).On “M*A*S*H” Stiers’ Major Winchester was witty where Frank Burns had been vapid ― with his Harvard education, a match for Alan Alda’s Hawkeye in the operating room and, unlike Frank, a worthy adversary in the ongoing battle of the pranks in the Swamp. So it was always poignant when an emotional crack opened in his self-satisfied mien.In the season eight episode “Morale Victory,” Winchester is proud of saving a wounded soldier’s leg, only to learn that the minor injury to the young man’s hand is all that matters to him, as he is a concert pianist. The soldier feels he has no reason for living, but in a powerful performance byStiers, Winchester provides him with piano music written for a single hand and shows him the empathy necessary to save him.Another time the audience saw a different side to Stier’s Winchester came in the ninth-season episode in which he swallows his pride and attempts to curry favor with a general who can send him back to the comforts of Tokyo ― but in the end, when the general asks him to testify unjustly against Margaret Houlihan ― Winchester declares, “I will not ― even for a return to that pearl of the Orient Tokyo ― lie to protect you while destroying a friend’s career!”In the busy year of 1985, Stiers also played the father to John Cusack’s hero in the ’80s teen movie “Better Off Dead” and the bitter enemy to Peter O’Toole’s eccentric scientist in “Creator,” while also appearing in ABC miniseries “North and South” as Congressman Sam Greene.The next year would bring more work in the form of “North and South Book II” ― and Stiers would begin a long series of “Perry Mason” telepics in which he played the always-fated-t0-lose prosecuting attorney. There were two of these NBC movies in 1986 and eight overall through 1988.He played Franklin D. Roosevelt twice: in “J. Edgar Hoover” and in Emmy-winning 1989 telepic “Day One,” about the Manhattan Project. In another esteemed telepic that year, “The Final Days,” about the Nixon White House, the actor played Gen. Alexander Haig.In addition to his work for Woody Allen, he played a wealthy railroad magnate in the live action Disney film “Iron Will” in 1994, a judge in the 1995 CIA thriller “Bad Company,” starring Ellen Barkin and Laurence Fishburne, and appeared in Frank Darabont’s Jim Carrey vehicle “The Majestic” in 2001.The actor also continued appearing on television, guesting on shows including “Murder, She Wrote” and recurring on ABC’s “Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place” in 1998 as the eccentric Mr. Bauer, who relayed the plots of movies as if they were stories of what had happened to him. He was a series regular on the brief CBS series “Love & Money” in 1999. In 2003 he memorably guested on an episode of “Frasier” in which Stiers played a former research associate of Frasier’s who is so like him and Niles, it has Martin questioning whether he is really their father.David Allen Ogden Stiers was born not in New England but in Peoria, Illinois, though the family moved to Eugene, Oregon, while he was in high school. He briefly attended the University of Oregon, began his professional career at the Actors Workshop in San Francisco, the California Shakespeare Festival and improv group the Committee before heading East and, starting in 1968, attending New York’s Juilliard and then joining at launch the Houseman Acting Company, where he was mentored by John Houseman.Stiers made his Broadway debut with simultaneous 1973 revivals of Chekhov’s “The Three Sisters,” in which he played Kulygin; “The Beggar’s Opera,” in which he played Peachum; “Measure for Measure,” in which he played the Duke; and Moliere’s “Scapin,” in which he played Geronte. Kevin Kline and Patti LuPone were also among those who appeared in the three productions. In 1974 he appeared in “Ulysses in Nighttown,” which was briefly staged on the Rialto starring Zero Mostel. Also that year he had a role in the original Stephen Schwartz musical “The Magic Show.”In 1971 he made his first bigscreen appearance, in the Jack Nicholson-directed “Drive, He Said.”He soon had a recurring role on the brief Barnard Hughes sitcom “Doc” and guested on “Kojak,” “Charlie’s Angels,” “Phyllis,” “Mary Tyler Moore” and “Rhoda” before being cast as Major Winchester on “M*A*S*H.” Even during his years on the hit show, he appeared in movies including “Oh! God,” starring John Denver and George Burns; “The Cheap Detective,” with Peter Falk; ventriloquist horror movie “Magic” with Anthony Hopkins; and TV movies including “Breaking Up Is Hard to Do” (1979), “The Oldest Living Graduate” (1980), “Father Damien: The Leper Priest” (1980) and “The Day the Bubble Burst.”In 2009 he returned to Broadway after an absence of many decades to appear in “Irving Berlin’s White Christmas.” The following year he appeared in a Shakespeare Center of Los Angeles production of “Much Ado About Nothing.”Stiers had his musical side, conducting orchestras around the world.In 2009, the actor revealed publicly that he was gay. He told ABC News at the time that he had hidden his sexuality for a long time because so much of his income had been derived from family-friendly programming, and coming out thus might have had repercussions in the past."
76,ENTERTAINMENT,How Weinstein And The Hollywood Machine Created ‘Good Guy’ Matt Damon,Matthew Jacobs,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/matt-damon-harvey-weinstein-good-guy-image_us_5a9477c5e4b01f65f5994a29,"The ""Good Will Hunting” star was molded to fit an enterprising liberal ideal. Then times changed and he didn’t.",2018-03-04,Ben Affleck and Matt Damon accept their awards for Best Original Screenplay at the 1998 Oscars.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a981eeb1e00008e0b7ad2fd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Shortly before “Good Will Hunting” hit theaters in December 1997, Matt Damon bought two duffel bags from Walmart. The movie’s buzz had escalated. Its benefactor, Harvey Weinstein, was plotting an awards campaign, and Damon was suddenly spending a lot of time in hotel rooms, with access to four-star room service and fitted suits.As almost any profile of Damon will tell you, the scrappy 27-year-old from Boston had spent the decade before clawing his way into Hollywood. And then, a short six months after “Good Will Hunting” opened, he would need those duffel bags for more nights spent in hotel rooms while promoting “Saving Private Ryan,” a Steven Spielberg epic that would earn him another ticket to an Oscar ceremony.This contrast — between Walmart luggage and Spielberg-flanked red carpets ― encapsulates Damon’s archetypal movie-star narrative: a persevering outsider heads to Tinseltown, sleeps in low-rent apartments, works odd jobs to foot the bills and accepts whatever roles he can find, hoping somehow to land a so-called break. It’s the American Dream, fed to the masses in pithy interview anecdotes and packaged for big screens across the country.And it’s the narrative that, 20 years ago, in conjunction with the Oscar he and Ben Affleck won for their “Good Will Hunting” script, turned the little-known Damon into the primo good guy next door ― an image that defined him, without fail, until Weinstein’s sexual misconduct scandal and a few unwoke gaffes reframed the Matt Damon Persona we’ve long accepted.The thing is, that persona was heavily produced and reliant on a collective nostalgia for a star who, just like us, totes around duffle bags and dresses in blue jeans. Damon’s rise to fame was so clean and simple that he never needed to update his image even as the times changed — and that’s exactly why now we’re wondering just how much we didn’t know about Mr. Matthew Paige Damon.To understand the Matt Damon Persona, we have to consider the ubiquity of polished celebrity images. Any well-regarded celebrity embodies a distinct ideal that informs how we relate to ― or at least envy ― them and what makes them a marketable brand. Usually, that image is born out of the thing that first drove the person’s fame, though nothing crystallizes without the help of savvy agents and publicists. An image can be reshaped or refracted with time, but it never escapes its origins entirely.Audrey Hepburn is still plastered on dorm-room walls as the personification of classic, elegant beauty. Viola Davis will forever be the actress who bolted onto the screen in one scene-stealing “Doubt” showdown with Meryl Streep. Even when Tom Cruise makes oddities like “Eyes Wide Shut” and “Magnolia,” he’s still the energetic blockbuster hero. Winona Ryder can star on a Netflix juggernaut, but she’ll always be the edgy outsider we met in “Beetlejuice” and “Edward Scissorhands.” Warren Beatty can settle down with Annette Bening, but only as a commentary on his years of Lothario notoriety.That said, few Hollywood luminaries hit the mainstream with an image as clearly outlined or as beloved as Matt Damon, which is a large part of why he hasn’t changed much in our eyes over the years. Revisiting coverage of Damon from the late ’90s, every piece frames him as a hard-working tenderfoot who’d determined that if he had any hope of a career in movies, he’d have to write one himself. That narrative of gumption was further solidified with his and Affleck’s shouty, wide-eyed Oscar speech, which they so happened to deliver during the “Titanic” year, aka the most-watched telecast in the awards’ history. The story goes: After dropping out of Harvard in 1992, Damon hustled for parts, attempting to earn his Serious Actor credentials by shedding 40 pounds for a supporting gig in the 1996 thriller “Courage Under Fire.” Meanwhile, he grew tired of going on endless auditions (“Primal Fear,” “Batman & Robin”) and reading scripts that Chris O’Donnell (LOL) and Leonardo DiCaprio had passed on. Lucky for him, Francis Ford Coppola wanted to cast an unknown in 1997′s “The Rainmaker,” right around the time that such John Grisham adaptations were guaranteed box-office gold. Damon and Affleck had already sold the “Good Will Hunting” screenplay to Miramax, but progress stalled as Weinstein, the distribution company’s tempestuous overlord, squabbled over which director to hire and whether to boot Damon and Affleck in favor of stars like DiCaprio and Brad Pitt.But the minute Damon booked “The Rainmaker,” everything changed. Weinstein “took a chance” on the “Hunting” boys, and Damon quickly segued into hot projects like “Saving Private Ryan,” “Dogma” and “The Talented Mr. Ripley” (even though DiCaprio had turned down the latter).Combined, those four movies form one of the most auspicious breakthroughs in modern cinema, a perfect blend of commercial appeal and art-house prestige. Suddenly, Damon was trying on Calvin Klein suits he’d never imagined wearing; eyeing the type of career Ed Harris had (read: not super Hollywood); ogling the fantasy of $10 million paychecks (in 2004, he would be paid a reported $26 million for the first Jason Bourne sequel); refraining from quoting “Forrest Gump” upon meeting Tom Hanks; appearing in tabloids for relationships with Winona Ryder, Minnie Driver and Gwyneth Paltrow; telling Oprah he slept on a Walmart air mattress after his Oscar victory; grinning about how “lucky” he was; and charming the pants off the media, which continually wrote about his killer smile, attractive-but-not-too-attractive looks, down-home wardrobe and exemplary manners. None of this alone is all that striking. Most Hollywood newcomers arrive with some version of an outsider tale, and there’s no reason to believe Damon’s ingenuity was inauthentic. But Weinstein, who was just finding his own footing as award season’s most cutthroat campaign guru, took Damon’s debut a step further, presenting him as the platonic ideal of an everyman, enterprising liberal who proves just how well the white male celebrity machine can work.In Peter Biskind’s revealing book Down and Dirty Pictures, Weinstein is quoted as inducting Damon and Affleck into the “Miramax family,” a small stable of talent whom Weinstein ushered to fame and turned into his mouthpieces (other members: Gwyneth Paltrow, Quentin Tarantino, Kevin Smith). Soon enough, Weinstein was carting Damfleck to Camp David to meet President Bill Clinton and first lady Hillary Clinton. (Only the good ones get to meet the prez!) Later, when Damon felt he’d done enough photo shoots and media appearances to promote “Good Will Hunting,” Wesintein pushed him to do more, despite telling USA Today in 1999 that “to Matt, it’s not about the whole movie-star thing.”It was the early 2000s when Damon’s cachet became seemingly indestructible. Even a couple of significant misfires ― “The Legend of Bagger Vance” (directed by Robert Redford) and Miramax’s “All the Pretty Horses” (directed by Billy Bob Thornton) ― couldn’t diminish that initial introduction. It didn’t hurt that Affleck, his ride-or-die with whom Damon was still customarily associated, suddenly made him look spotless by comparison.Between 1998 and 2001, Affleck toplined “Armageddon,” “Forces of Nature,” “Bounce,” “Reindeer Games” and “Pearl Harbor” ― a stellar sequence, popularity-wise. But the attention had an adverse effect: Between 2001 and 2005, Affleck went to rehab for alcohol abuse, endured a tabloid-splashed breakup with Jennifer Lopez, starred in a series of critical and commercial disappointments (including the infamous “Gigli”), hit the cagey celebrity poker scene, and called his life a “slow-motion train wreck” during a “Saturday Night Live” monologue. As Affleck’s reputation dipped, Damon landed the “Ocean’s” trilogy and headlined the never-ending Bourne series, married a non-celebrity in 2005, and earned another Oscar nomination for the 2009 drama “Invictus” ― all while maintaining a clean-cut media presence. Even though his salary had outgrown Miramax’s coffers, he still subscribed to the Weinstein playbook: Find a sweet spot between serious cinema and wholesale crowd-pleasers, and then schmooze, schmooze, schmooze.“Matty and Ben are two people that Harvey strives every waking moment of his life to be in business with,” Kevin Smith told Biskind. The fact that Damon no longer needed to be a member of Weinstein’s “family” made him seem cool, and yet the Matt Damon Persona remained something of a Weinstein production. Miramax paid the actor “a whole lot of money” for a cameo in Smith’s 2001 comedy “Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.” Weinstein wanted to splash Damon on the poster and include him in the television ads, but according to Down and Dirty Pictures, Damon commanded him not to. Knowing how to retail his worth, the actor wanted his appearance in the movie to be a surprise.Weinstein reportedly acquiesced until the last minute, deciding he needed Damon to help drive business. He called Damon, told him the news of his cameo had leaked and added him to the marketing ― building on the idea that this craftsman who wrote an Oscar-winning screenplay was affable enough to appear in something as frivolous as “Jay and Silent Bob.”So it has continued throughout recent years: Matt Damon is so kind and so famous that being the butt of a bawdy Jimmy Kimmel joke is a badge of honor! He founded a nonprofit to give developing countries access to clean water! He’s a spokesman for a hunger relief organization! His liberal sensibilities let him pal around with Barack Obama!But in 2015, the Matt Damon Persona started to show cracks, one after the next. During a controversial exchange on his HBO reality show “Project Greenlight,” he interrupted a black female producer to imply that diversity behind the camera is unimportant. The internet erupted with accusations of whitesplaining and mansplaining. Two weeks later, he lightly suggested that gay actors should stay in the closet so as to maintain a certain “mystery.” And a few months after that, he came under fire for misunderstanding the whitewashing accusations lobbed at the bonkers movie “The Great Wall,” in which European mercenaries descend upon China to fight a swarm of monstrous creatures. That wasn’t enough to shatter him, though. A July 2016 GQ piece still likened him to ultimate nice guy Jimmy Stewart. “Matt Damon is, scientifically, the most liked man in Hollywood,” the first sentence read.And then Weinstein re-entered the picture in late 2017, and the Matt Damon Persona went from cracked to shattered. After The New York Times published a career-ending investigation detailing allegations of Weinstein’s long-rumored sexual misconduct, former Times reporter Sharon Waxman said Damon had called her in 2004 to defend one of Weinstein’s accomplices, effectively helping to kill her investigation. Even though Waxman corroborated Damon’s claim that he had no knowledge of Weinstein’s misdeeds, the actor couldn’t avoid putting his foot in his mouth. “I do believe that there’s a spectrum of behavior,” he said in an interview with film critic Peter Travers. “And we’re going to have to figure — you know, there’s a difference between, you know, patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation, right? Both of those behaviors need to be confronted and eradicated without question, but they shouldn’t be conflated, right?”It’s not that Damon is wrong, per se, but his flippant tone struck an unwelcome chord right amid the Me Too groundswell. And he took it a step further, going soft on alleged harasser Louis C.K. by saying, “I imagine the price that he’s paid at this point is so beyond anything that he ― I just think that we have to kind of start delineating between what these behaviors are.”If nothing else, this reflected his wealthy-white-male privilege, something no one was talking about during Damon’s Weinstein-assisted rise to fame. The actor soon found himself apologizing on the “Today” show: “I really wish I’d listened a lot more before I weighed in on this. Ultimately what it is for me is that I don’t want to further anybody’s pain with anything that I do or say. So for that, I am really sorry. A lot of those women are my dear friends and I love them and respect them and support what they’re doing and want to be a part of that change and want to go along for the ride — but I should get in the backseat and close my mouth for a while.”Closing his mouth for a while was a fine idea. But apologies and clarifications are increasingly hard to live down in the internet age, when an infinite loop of headlines and tweets can redefine a person’s polished image overnight. Will Damon recover from these blunders? Sure, probably. But now his box-office power is in flux. In October, the misguided racial satire “Suburbicon,” directed by George Clooney, was eviscerated by critics and ignored by audiences. In December, “Downsizing,” the disappointing Alexander Payne dramedy once thought to be an Oscar contender, did so-so business at best. The only forthcoming project on Damon’s docket is June’s female-fronted “Ocean’s 8,” in which he is very much not the center of attention. In fact, nearly 30,000 people have signed an online petition to have him removed from the film because of his comments on sexual harassment. And therein lies the boomerang that is the star-making machine. Weinstein helped construct the Matt Damon Persona, and he inadvertently helped tarnish it, too. Damon’s signature trait ― being normal, even boring ― became his detriment: He was so middlebrow that he didn’t really think critically about race or gender politics or what it means for public figures to own their sexuality.For my money, the conversation isn’t about whether Matt Damon’s time in Hollywood should come to an end. We’re all learning how to rework the patriarchal power dynamics that have governed society for far too long. What Damon proves, instead, is how fallible the celebrity engine is. Hollywood images are constructed in implicit coordination among studio honchos, calculating publicists, an ever-evolving media and the public’s appetite for stars who offer some magical blend of the relatable and the aspirational. No matter how much we think we know a famous person, there is always an artificial quality to what he or she presents to the world ― one that doesn’t fit into budget-priced duffel bags. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story indicated Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez divorced. In fact, they were never married."

No screening was done of people who wanted to adopt the dogs.Several soldiers searched for and rescued their dogs from Army kennels, the report said.Army spokesmen did not respond to multiple telephone and e-mail messages seeking comment. Reuters was unable to reach former soldiers who had issued complaints containing accusations of mistreatment of dogs with which they had worked.The dogs served in Afghanistan from 2010 to 2014.

Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, is the target of a new liberal petition campaign.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a9b053b1e0000fb077ad5e6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Three leading progressive organizations launched a petition campaign Friday demanding that the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee “stop attacking progressives.”The petition, which is directed at DCCC Chairman Rep. Ben Ray Luján (N.M.), is a joint initiative of Justice Democrats, a progressive group that backs left-leaning primary candidates; Credo, a liberal, issue-based, online organizing outfit; and Our Revolution, the legacy group for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 2016 presidential run.“We call on Chairman of the DCCC Ben Ray Luján to stop attacking progressives,” a version of the petition circulated by Justice Democrats states. “Democrats should fight for progressive values and offer a clear contrast to [President Donald] Trump and the Republican Party.”The groups’ decision to mobilize their formidable email lists to pressure the DCCC, which helps elect Democrats to the House, reflects a frustration that has come to a head in the past two weeks and could jeopardize party unity ahead of midterm elections where Democrats hope to make big gains.Progressive activists believe the DCCC’s intervention in contentious primaries ― which has largely consisted of promoting moderate candidates and cautious campaign rhetoric ― reflects misguided political strategy and contempt for the Democratic base.The most notable flashpoint between the DCCC and the liberal grassroots was the DCCC’s Feb. 23 publication of an opposition research dossier against Laura Moser, an anti-Trump activist-turned-progressive candidate running in Texas’ 7th Congressional District. The campaign arm’s memo featured a selectively edited quote from Moser and described her as a “Washington insider, who begrudgingly moved to Houston to run for Congress.”A series of revelations this week, however, served as the more immediate catalyst for the petition effort. HuffPost reported that the DCCC advised candidates to avoid “politicizing” the Las Vegas and Parkland, Florida, shootings in the immediate aftermath of those massacres. The Intercept also broke news that the party body used a questionably worded survey to counsel candidates against embracing single-payer health care, or even proactively volunteering health policy ideas. Justice Democrats, Credo and Our Revolution, which drafted similar but not identical petitions, all referenced the HuffPost and Intercept stories in their appeals. “The goal is to call attention to the DCCC and the Democratic Party leadership shooting itself in the foot and missing opportunities of where the party should really be investing in, which is progressive leaders, leaders of color who are gonna help them get back the majority,” said Waleed Shahid, a spokesman for Justice Democrats, which, like Our Revolution, has endorsed Moser’s primary bid. (Credo does not endorse candidates.)Justice Democrats hope to receive an apology from Luján and a promise not to intervene in Democratic primaries going forward, according to Shahid.That response does not appear forthcoming. When asked about progressive discontent with the DCCC, communications director Meredith Kelly said the DCCC “has long recognized and appreciated the unprecedented influence that the grassroots have in these races.”Kelly nonetheless maintained that the campaign arm “is keeping all options on the table to work with our allies and ensure that there’s a competitive Democrat on the ballot for voters to elect in November.”The dispute between the DCCC and left-wing groups with millions of active members reflects a broader disagreement between the so-called Democratic “establishment” ― comprising mainstream elected officials, party leaders and donors ― and the restive, progressive base.With its focus on the best-funded, most moderate and most cautious candidates, the DCCC apparently sees a path to retaking the House through the mostly affluent, moderate Republicans displeased with Trump.The DCCC arguably deployed this strategy successfully in the 2006 midterms, the last time Democrats flipped the House.But Shahid and his allies say the 2016 elections proved this tactic is no longer viable. Hillary Clinton’s campaign was predicated on the notion that she could pick up enough moderate Republicans to offset Trump’s gains among blue-collar Democrats.In the end, the combination of blue-collar white voters’ swing to Trump, and dampened turnout among young people and people of color in key industrial states, cost Clinton the election.“You need to engage the base if we’re gonna be in the majority, which is communities of color, young people, progressives and working-class people of all races who don’t feel like the party represents them,” Shahid said."
80,POLITICS,The Dumb Reason Some Kids Born To LGBTQ Americans Aren’t U.S. Citizens,Jessica Schulberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lgbtq-parents-kids-citizens-state-department_us_5a8848a4e4b00bc49f449455,The State Department is relying on an outdated policy that is at odds with federal court precedents.,2018-03-03,"Demonstrators gather in front of the Supreme Court on March 26, 2013, before the court struck down a key provision of the so-called Defense of Marriage Act.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a884bed2000002d00eaf292.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — For years, under multiple presidents, the State Department has ignored key court rulings that should guide how it grants citizenship to children who are born abroad to LGBTQ Americans. Instead, the department has clung to an outdated interpretation of the law under which it requires a biological tie between the U.S. citizen parent and the child. This has led to absurd results: American parents who have one child the government deems to be American and another child it does not. The executive branch could fix this policy on its own, without Congress changing the law. But under multiple administrations, the State Department has ignored pressure from advocates to make sure that LGBTQ Americans have the same ability to pass on their citizenship to their children as straight Americans do. Two same-sex couples are now suing the government for denying U.S. citizenship to their kids who were born abroad. One parent in each couple is an American citizen. In one of the cases, the State Department granted a U.S. passport ― the effective proof of citizenship ― to one boy who was born in Canada but not to his twin brother. In the other case, the department granted a passport to a baby boy born in the U.K. but not to his brother.Consular officials are making these decisions based on an internal State Department policy that purports to require a biological or blood relationship between a child and a parent in order for the parent to pass along U.S. citizenship when that child is born abroad. But because of the way the policy is written, consular officials are more likely to investigate LGBTQ parents than straight parents to prove a child’s blood ties.Court rulings suggest that no such investigation of whether children are biologically related to their married U.S. citizen parent is mandated by law. Two rulings by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, one in 2000 and the other in 2005, made clear that the Immigration and Nationality Act — the law on which the State Department’s policy is based — does not require a blood relationship to pass along U.S. citizenship to children born outside the country.The principle that undergirds these precedents is clear as well: It’s the reality of being a parent, not a biological tie, that conveys citizenship to one’s newborn baby. In 2000, a 9th Circuit panel considered the case of Stanley Russell Scales Jr., who was born in the Philippines to a Filipina mother and an American father. His mother told his father shortly after they met that she was pregnant, probably from a previous relationship. They married shortly before Scales Jr. was born and raised him as their own in the United States. Years later, Scales Jr. was convicted of cocaine possession and immigration authorities marked him as deportable. When the case made its way to the 9th Circuit, the court ruled that he had inherited U.S. citizenship from his father, even though they weren’t biologically related. Five years later, the 9th Circuit heard the case of Eduardo Solis-Espinoza, who was born in Mexico to two Mexican nationals. But his father was married to a U.S. citizen at the time. He had an affair with the woman who gave birth to Solis-Espinoza and who then abandoned the baby. Solis-Espinoza was raised in the U.S. by his biological father and his father’s American wife as their own. Like that of Scales Jr., Solis-Espinoza’s case made its way to the 9th Circuit after immigration authorities moved to deport him for drug-related charges. Again, the court held that he had inherited U.S. citizenship from his mother, even though they shared no biological tie.The Immigration and Nationality Act requires “clear and convincing evidence” of a biological relationship between a U.S. citizen father and a child where the father is not married to the mother — ostensibly to prevent American men from going abroad and transmitting citizenship to children who are the result of one-night stands. But a “straightforward reading” of the law indicates that “there is no requirement of a blood relationship” for kids born to married parents, Judge A. Wallace Tashima wrote in the 9th Circuit opinion in the Scales Jr. case. Judge Richard Clifton then cited that decision when he wrote the Solis-Espinoza opinion.Despite those court precedents, the State Department’s Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM) still requires a U.S. citizen parent to be biologically related to a child in order to transmit citizenship. And because of the way its guidance is written, the policy disproportionately harms same-sex couples.Technically, the FAM requires a biological or blood relationship between parent and child in all cases. But “children born in wedlock are generally presumed to be the issue of that marriage,” the FAM says. In other words, government officials won’t usually ask any questions when a married couple with at least one U.S. citizen spouse comes into an embassy or a consulate seeking a U.S. passport for their kid. But if there is reason to doubt that a child is biologically related to the parent with U.S. citizenship, “the consular officer is expected to investigate carefully,” the FAM continues. Reasons for doubt, according to the guidance, include but are not limited to: The conception or birth of a child when either of the biological parents was married to another person.Even though there’s no evidence that this guidance was written with the intent of discriminating against LGBTQ citizens, it has the effect of placing extra scrutiny on married same-sex couples, who are far more likely to use surrogacy or assisted reproductive technology than straight couples and whose children will always have a biological tie to someone other than the married parents. This means logically that consular officials can almost always find reason to doubt the eligibility for citizenship of kids born abroad to same-sex couples and that those children will be more likely to be defined as aliens by the U.S. government. If these children are born in countries that, unlike the U.S., don’t provide birthright citizenship, they can even be rendered stateless. The State Department’s interpretation of the law “is based on an outdated notion of parenthood,” Alison Kamhi, a supervising attorney at the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, told HuffPost. “In the past, ‘biological’ was shorthand for parenthood and now it’s not.”Immigration lawyers and human rights organizations have been pushing the State Department for years to re-examine its view of the law. During President Barack Obama’s first term, they recruited Michael Guest, a former State Department official who had experience lobbying his old agency to update policies that discriminated against the LGBTQ community, to help arrange meetings with State Department officials. In 2012, the American Immigration Lawyers Association sent the department a list of recommended changes to the FAM “in order to bring it into better conformance with modern technology, family law, and social understanding.” The proposals would allow same-sex couples and couples who used assisted reproductive technology to pass on citizenship to their children born abroad. “Focusing solely on relationships that can be established through DNA testing alleviates concerns about fraud, but this policy is not based on sound statutory interpretation,” the lawyers association wrote, citing the text of the Immigration and Nationality Act and the 9th Circuit precedents. “More importantly, it profoundly harms U.S. citizens and their children and undermines the [act’s] deep concern with family unity.” After the Supreme Court struck down a key part of the Defense of Marriage Act in 2013, clearing the way for same-sex couples to secure the same federal rights as straight couples, immigration lawyers saw an opportunity, said Aaron Morris, the executive director at Immigration Equality who is currently representing the plaintiffs in the two lawsuits. Morris and his colleagues argue that the 2013 decision should compel the State Department to update its policies around transmitting citizenship so that married same-sex couples would have the same rights as married straight couples.State Department officials were aware of the need for modernization, Guest said. But change happens slowly there — especially on an issue that intersects with immigration, which requires close coordination with the Department of Homeland Security. The people lobbying the State Department presented officials with examples of individuals suffering under the outdated policy. Officials were particularly receptive to the scenario of an American woman living abroad who became pregnant using a donor egg and her non-U.S. citizen husband’s sperm ― she would not be considered “related” to her child, even though she carried and gave birth to the baby. “That’s one set of examples that was most compelling and it’s the one that the government addressed,” said Scott Titshaw, an associate dean at Mercer University School of Law in Georgia. In 2014, under President Barack Obama, the State Department announced a modest policy change: Mothers who gave birth to a baby using a donor egg would “be treated the same as genetic mothers for the purposes of immigration benefits.” “It was an important change, but it was the low-hanging fruit,” Titshaw said. “It was certainly considerably less than what they were being asked to do and what they should have done.”It was a “minor concession,” Morris said. “We really advocated for a solution to the entire community. It didn’t happen.”The State Department declined to comment on why it has been resistant to further modifications of its policy, citing the pending litigation. “My guess is that the government agencies were worried about fraud,” Titshaw said. “If it is possible to determine in a yes-or-no question whether someone can transmit citizenship to a child, and they can do that with a genetic test, that’s very appealing to officials’ souls when you want to have a clear answer without having to consider a lot of factors.” The State Department has previously cited a concern with “baby supermarkets and the apparent womb-rental market,” the American Immigration Lawyers Association wrote in its 2012 letter. But there was no evidence that their proposed changes would exacerbate any such problem, the lawyers wrote. By 2016, Morris said he realized that the Obama administration was unlikely to make the changes he was pushing for so he reached out to Hillary Clinton’s campaign. They were receptive to his concerns and he hoped the State Department would adjust its policies if Clinton became president. But when Donald Trump won the election, Morris gave up hope that the department would act on its own and started looking for plaintiffs to participate in a lawsuit. Morris’ current clients are evidence that the 2014 changes to the FAM didn’t fully address the reality of modern-day families. In one of the cases, Dvash-Banks v. U.S. Department of State, a married couple consisting of an American man and an Israeli man had twin boys in Canada after a surrogate carried eggs from an anonymous donor that were fertilized with the men’s sperm. When they applied for U.S. passports for their twins, a consular official required DNA testing, which showed that one boy had the American father’s DNA and the other had the Israeli father’s DNA. The boy with the American father’s DNA was approved for a U.S. passport. His brother was denied. The second case, Blixt v. U.S. Department of State, involves a married American woman and Italian woman who have two sons born in the United Kingdom. Using sperm from an unknown donor, the Italian woman carried the first baby and the American woman carried the second. The first baby was denied a U.S. passport; the second was granted one. The State Department “could literally change this overnight,” Morris said. But if the Obama administration couldn’t or wouldn’t modernize government policy on who gets to be a U.S. citizen, it’s unlikely that the Trump administration — which has aggressively rolled back LGBTQ rights over the past year and argued for more restrictive policies on who receives U.S. citizenship — will engage in any such reform voluntarily. This means it’s up to the courts again. Yet courts have ruled on these issues before. The question is whether this time the State Department and the White House will listen.

81,POLITICS,Trump's Tariff Can't Start A Trade War Because It Started Years Ago,Zach Carter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-trade-war-globalization_us_5a99dacfe4b089ec353a4c95,Globalization policies were wreaking havoc long before he was elected president.,2018-03-03,President Donald Trump's clumsy attack on foreign steel isn't the real problem.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a99dbfa1f00005100168fdd.jpeg?cache=PkGRVX7PN2&ops=crop_11_23_2989_1287%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump’s announcement that he would place tariffs on steel and aluminum imports has economists cringing. Conservative Republicans are dusting off the principles they learned in Econ 101, liberal Nobel laureate Paul Krugman is warning that Trump will start an economically destructive trade war, and prominent world leaders are vowing to prove Krugman right. On Friday, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker threatened to retaliate against “unfair” U.S. tariffs with new levies on American motorcycles, bourbon and blue jeans.It’s messy, unpredictable and unlikely to generate much international goodwill. But the truth is, Trump’s clumsy volley can’t start a trade war. Despite its blunt imprecision, a tariff on steel and aluminum just doesn’t affect very much commerce. More importantly, the world is already living through a trade war. It’s been raging since the 1990s.The international experiment typically referred to as “globalization” isn’t a sterile set of enhancements to industrial efficiency. It’s a political doctrine. Its terms were controversial when they were ratified in the 1990s with the establishment of the World Trade Organization, but the project was charged with very specific political goals. Globalization was supposed to foster international stability and improve the standard of living for rich and poor countries alike, while encouraging ― in the words of then-President Bill Clinton ― “political reform” in nations hostile to democracy.A quarter of a century later, it’s clear that this system has failed. Its fruits can be seen in the rise of far-right nationalist groups throughout Europe, the election of Donald Trump in America and the rise of an authoritarian superpower in China.These are big problems that Trump’s little tariff won’t fix. But he also can’t break what is already broken.As with just about any Trump policy proposal, the steel and aluminum tariff is riddled with “ifs.” The president has a habit of promising major changes and then doing ... nothing. He’s been talking tough on trade his entire presidency, while watching the trade deficit drift higher as manufacturing jobs continue to disappear. On Twitter, he seems to have already shifted his proposal from a tariff on steel and aluminum to an import duty covering everything being shipped into the country. Nobody really knows where this thing is headed.But the response from the European Union’s Juncker is instructive. He called Trump’s announcement “a blatant intervention to protect U.S. domestic industry,” which was not “based on any national security justification.”It’s true that the U.S. hasn’t cited national security to justify steel tariffs in the globalization era. But Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Harry Truman certainly regarded the domestic steel industry as a national security asset, and both presidents implemented some pretty radical policies to preserve it (Truman even briefly nationalized the steel industry to break a strike during the Korean War). Trump’s decision is diplomatically reckless, but it is not, as Krugman charged, “transparently bogus.”FDR and Truman recognized that trade policy isn’t really about prices and production. Tariff reductions, international currency summits and bank bailouts are, at their root, methods of distributing political power and accountability. Advocates of the 1990s globalization experiment, meanwhile, have a tendency to describe the status quo as “fair” or “free,” while attacking deviations from it as offenses against the sanctity of prices. But globalization isn’t neutral. It rewards some interest groups and disadvantages others.Under WTO treaties and a series of pacts modeled on the North American Free Trade Agreement, prescription drugmakers in the U.S. and Europe are guaranteed long-term global monopolies on life-saving medication. This encourages predatory pricing, restricts access to medical care and burdens public budgets ― especially in poor countries. The labor rules included in those same agreements have encouraged manufacturing jobs to flow from the U.S. to countries that suppress wages and workers’ rights with authoritarian tactics and outright violence. Meanwhile, multinational corporations are granted the right to challenge the laws and regulations produced by democratic governments before international courts. These are all just examples. The core idea was to empower corporations to drive social progress that, globalization proponents believed, governments were incapable of delivering.These policies didn’t fall out of the sky on the sixth day of creation. They were developed in the 1990s, and public health advocates, environmental organizations, labor unions, consumer protection groups and human rights activists have been working to change them ever since.Trump hasn’t shown a hint of interest in reversing any of this humanitarian damage. But criticism of his tariff has come with a reflexive defense of these policies that have empowered anti-democratic movements because they are, ultimately, undemocratic.Trade on mutually beneficial terms can’t solve every political problem. But by guaranteeing citizens of democracies access to resources, jobs and credit, it could remove the economic fuel for resentment and hostility. Instead, globalization has created the impression that the system is rigged ― because it is.The EU, for instance, is essentially a trade war between Germany and the European periphery. Germany runs up persistent trade surpluses with poorer countries, securing good manufacturing jobs for itself while saddling its neighbors with massive debt burdens, mostly owed to German banks. When these debts start to look unpayable, Germany ― acting through the EU and the European Central Bank ― declares economic war on countries that threaten to default. That’s what happened to Greece in 2015. Greek democracy was sacrificed for German banking profits.Militant nationalist parties have risen up throughout Europe, capitalizing on angst about globalization to scapegoat Jews, foreigners and refugees. Grievances about jobs shipped abroad and austerity imposed at home have been channeled into anger toward people who look different. It’s an old playbook, and it works depressingly often. Trump racked up political victories in counties most adversely impacted by trade with China ― including in the decisive states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Ohio ― as he, too, ranted against globalization and immigrants.It’s too late to remedy all this with import duties and tariffs alone. Even modest goals, like attempting to rebuild the American manufacturing base, would take years of work re-engineering global supply chains. But whatever happens, Trump’s latest provocations will still be just a product of this broken system, not its cause."
82,POLITICS,Kentucky Bill To Outlaw Child Marriage Stalled Amid Conservative Concerns,Sebastian Murdock,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kentucky-bill-child-marriage_us_5a9acca4e4b0a0ba4ad3d03f,The Family Foundation of Kentucky opposes child marriage but wants to preserve parents’ say in their kids’ lives.,2018-03-03,A bill to end child marriage is being delayed over concerns about parental rights.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a9acf332000003800eb088a.jpeg?cache=EyBMpc88ss&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A bill to stop child marriage in Kentucky was stalled by a conservative group this week, leaving some state lawmakers furious. But the group said they just want to protect parents’ rights in the process.State Sen. Julie Raque Adams (R-Louisville) introduced Senate Bill 48 after she learned that Kentucky has the third-highest rate of child marriage in the country, just below Texas and Florida, according to Insider Louisville. From 2000 to 2015, more than 10,000 children were married in Kentucky, according to the Tahirih Justice Center. Donna Pollard, a leading advocate for the bill, told the Courier Journal that she was married at 16 to an older man who had sexually abused her since she was just 14. She said she was encouraged to marry by her mother, who had been wed at just 13 years old herself.She described her former husband as a “perpetrator” who regularly abused her.“I felt just completely and totally trapped,” said Pollard, who is now divorced.The so-called “child bride” legislation would bar marriage for anyone under age 17 and require judicial approval for a 17-year-old to wed. Under current law, 16- and 17-year-olds can marry with parental permission, and children can marry even younger when there’s a pregnancy involved, Insider Louisville explains.Passage of the bill would seem easy enough. But late Wednesday, Adams tweeted that a vote on the legislation had been stalled. She told Insider Louisville that the Family Foundation of Kentucky, a conservative group that lobbies on social issues, was behind the delay.Eileen Recktenwald, the executive director of the Kentucky Association of Sexual Assault Programs, also expressed her disgust.“This is legalized rape of children,” Recktenwald told the Courier Journal. “We cannot allow that to continue in Kentucky, and I cannot believe we are even debating this in the year 2018 in the United States.”Mary Kunze, a spokeswoman for the Family Foundation of Kentucky, told HuffPost that the group supports the bill overall, but wanted changes to the provision allowing a 17-year-old to get married with a judge’s consent. Kunze said they wanted it to make clear that a parent must also agree to the marriage.“We just want the language cleaned up,” Kunze said. “The compromises have all been made. We’re hoping the bill can come back this next week.” Adams told Insider Louisville that the bill is being adjusted, but she had one caveat: “Many times the parents are the problem,” pushing their kids “into the arms of a predator.” The story has been updated with comment from a Family Foundation spokeswoman and the headline has been adjusted to make clear that the foundation opposes child marriage."
