That link, in addition to the high rate of losses sustained by the type of Ukrainian artillery units targeted by hackers, creates high confidence that Fancy Bear was responsible for the implant, he said.“This cannot be a hands-off group or a bunch of criminals, they need to be in close communication with the Russian military,” Alperovitch said.The implant leveraged a legitimate Android application developed by a Ukrainian artillery officer to process targeting data more quickly, CrowdStrike said.Its deployment “extends Russian cyber capabilities to the front lines of the battlefield”, the report said, and “could have facilitated anticipatory awareness of Ukrainian artillery force troop movement, thus providing Russian forces with useful strategic planning information”.Downloads of the legitimate app were promoted on pages used by Ukrainian artillery on vKontakte, a Russian social media website, CrowdStrike said. There is no evidence the application was made available in the Android app store, limiting its distribution, the firm said.The implant used on the legitimate app appears to be the first observed case of Fancy Bear malware used on the Android platform, according to the report.(Reporting by Dustin Volz; Editing by Paul Tait)"

Douma, the largest town in the Eastern Ghouta area, with more than 100,000 residents, is surrounded and regularly shelled by regime forces.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5855bbb11200005e0eeefe81.jpeg?cache=uSyVWVZlWQ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After three years under siege, children in Eastern Ghouta are forced to steal and beg for their survival. To make matters worse, those who are caught are subjected to Jaish al-Islam’s harsh judicial system – where the punishment can be prison or physical labour.ISTANBUL – It was a hot day in August 2016 when two brothers in the besieged southwest Syrian town of Douma lingered outside the downtown mosque during the noon prayer. Grabbing a pair of men’s shoes as the owner prayed inside, the two boys ran away with the contraband. They could sell them for up to 500 Syrian pounds (around $2.50), enough to buy a bag of bread.The boys didn’t make it very far with their stolen goods. Before they had a chance to sell the shoes, 10-year-old Bilal and his 15-year-old brother Ibrahim were arrested by an opposition fighter who had spotted them outside the mosque.“All we wanted, my brother and I, was to buy some food, and take it to our mother,” said Bilal. “We thought that whoever had left their shoes at the gate would not mind, because their houses were close to the mosque, and they would not walk far barefoot.”Food is hard to come by in Douma. Located in the Eastern Ghouta suburbs, only 6 miles (10km) from the capital Damascus, the town of nearly 140,000 people has been under siege by government forces since 2013. Little international aid has made it inside in the past four years, and children are increasingly vulnerable in the unrelenting conditions of siege and war.At least 15,099 children (under the age of 18) have been killed in Syria’s war, according to a September 2016 report by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group. A Save the Children report earlier this year found that 7.5 million children are negatively impacted by the ongoing war, 2 million of whom are not attending school. Among that number were Ibrahim and Bilal.The boys’ father was killed by a government airstrike on Douma in May 2015 – an attack that left Bilal with only one foot. (Ibrahim would later share the same fate as his father in a regime airstrike more than a year later.) With their mother, Um Ibrahim, left to provide for her children by herself, the brothers tried to adjust to the tightening blockade and the family’s precarious situation. They did not attend school, but instead spent their days collecting plastic objects and selling them for loose change. When all the plastic had been scavenged from the streets, they resorted to begging for money, and – ultimately – a failed attempt to steal shoes.The fighter who had caught the boys was a member of Jaish al-Islam, one of the largest fighting factions in Eastern Ghouta. The armed opposition group controls Douma’s internal affairs, including a judiciary system based on their interpretation of Islamic Sharia law. Bilal and Ibrahim were referred to a Sharia court, where the judge sentenced Bilal to one month in prison and Ibrahim to one month of unpaid labor.“I did not know that my boys were roaming the streets begging for money until they were arrested,” said Um Ibrahim, who asked that her real name be omitted for security reasons. “I was shocked that the court’s decision did not take our situation into consideration.”The judge offered Bilal a chance to reduce his sentence by memorizing parts of the Quran, but the 10-year-old did not know how to read or write. Bilal was placed in an underground cell with adult prisoners, spending a month in the militia’s al-Tawba prison, a facility notorious for its abuse and torture methods.“Everything smelled so bad, and all the faces were so scary,” Bilal said, describing his cell – and the fear he felt being separated from his brother.Older detainees like Ibrahim often serve sentences of hard, unpaid labor. Tunnels managed by Jaish al-Islam connect the besieged town to government-held neighborhoods, and are used for smuggling: a lucrative business. Ibrahim spent a month cementing and transporting dirt inside the tunnels in exchange for one meal a day, at the end of which he would sleep in the prison.“The work was very hard, and it caused sharp pain in my back,” Ibrahim told Syria Deeply after his release in September. “I was the youngest, and I was so scared that the tunnels might collapse. I did not want to die, because I did not want to leave my mother alone.”Following his release, Ibrahim found work at a falafel shop managed by the family’s neighbor, Abu Muhammad. “(He) felt bad for us, and offered my son Ibrahim a job,” Um Ibrahim said. “Ibrahim was very happy.” It was to be a short-lived period of happiness, however. In October, Ibrahim was killed when government airstrikes on the town hit the shop.Bilal and Um Ibrahim continue to live in Douma, and the 10-year-old struggles with recurring nightmares from his time spent in prison. In order to support what remains of her family, Um Ibrahim cleans the houses of Douma’s wealthier residents, including employees of Jaish al-Islam, the group that imprisoned her children for the crime of stealing so that they might be able to eat.This article originally appeared on Syria Deeply.

5,POLITICS,Feds Consider Civil Rights Probe Of Deadly Jail Run By Trump Ally Sheriff David Clarke,Ryan J. Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/david-clarke-jail-deaths-milwaukee_us_585b0041e4b0d9a594570f5a,Four people -- including a newborn baby -- have died at Milwaukee County Jail since April.,2016-12-22,The Department of Justice is considering opening an investigation into a jail that Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke is tasked with running.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585b04371c000011070eceba.jpeg?cache=kCc1L06wVS&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The Justice Department is considering opening a federal civil rights investigation into the Milwaukee County Jail, a facility nominally run by high-profile Donald Trump supporter Sheriff David Clarke.Four people ― including a newborn infant ― have died at the jail since April. One man with mental health problems literally died of thirst. But Clarke, who has spent much of his time this year promoting himself and Trump in conservative media outlets, has blamed pretty much everyone but himself for the conditions at the facility he is charged with running.Earlier this month, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Wis.) asked the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division to open an investigation into the practices of the Milwaukee County Jail. Now DOJ is considering doing just that.“We will carefully consider your letter along with other information we may receive regarding Milwaukee County Jail in order to determine whether a pattern or practice investigation may be necessary,” Assistant Attorney General Peter J. Kadzik wrote in a letter to Moore dated Dec. 15. “Our decision to open a pattern or practice investigation is based on a number of factors, including the severity and frequency of alleged deprivation of rights; the effectiveness of any remedial actions taken by the jurisdiction to address deficiencies in policies, procedures or practices; the resources of the Special Litigation Section to investigate the allegations; and the need to address systemic deficiencies in other jurisdictions across the country,” the letter stated.The “shocking number of deaths and the manner in which these individuals died underscore the need for accountability and transparency in our criminal justice system,” Eric Harris, Moore’s communications director, said in a statement. “Unfortunately, Sheriff Clarke has made it clear that he has no intention in addressing the ambiguity surrounding these tragedies,” Harris said. “It seems the only thing Sheriff Clarke is concerned with right now is supporting President-elect Trump’s post-election victory lap. The families of those who died deserve answers as to how their loved ones lost their lives behind bars on Sheriff Clarke’s watch.”DOJ’s letter comes shortly after reports that Clarke “threatened” and “verbally pummeled” the county’s chief medical examiner after he released information about deaths at the facility. Milwaukee County is now auditing medical care at the facility following a report from a court-appointed monitor that said better staffing might have saved lives.“Questions certainly can be raised about the occurrence of these four recent deaths and the relationship to officer shortages ... as well as the health care staffing vacancies and the adequacy of oversight of staff,” the medical monitor said in a report.The Milwaukee County Board has called for independent investigations into the jail deaths, though it cannot force the Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office to agree.

That way, he’s always grabbing pussies ― all across America.”The good doctor’s expression was priceless.Trump-themed birth control may be a pipe dream, but, as Lydic demonstrates in the clip above, reproductive rights may the best gift you can give the woman in your life this holiday season."
7,MEDIA,Veteran GOP Spokesman Sean Spicer Named White House Press Secretary,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sean-spicer-white-house-press-secretary_us_5853094fe4b08debb7882cf1,He's part of Donald Trump's transition team that's reassessing longstanding traditions in how the White House deals with reporters.,2016-12-22,Sean Spicer has been named White House Press secretary.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585309991c000011070ebcc8.jpeg?cache=paGJkt6Iv9&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sean Spicer, a top surrogate for Donald Trump’s presidential campaign who’s now a senior communications adviser for his transition, has been named White House press secretary.Spicer, who had been Republican National Committee communications director since 2011 and the party’s chief strategist since 2015, was a forceful defender of Trump in the media, even as some Republicans kept their distance or opposed his candidacy. An August headline in The Washington Post captured his predicament: “What happens when you tie your career to Donald Trump? Ask Sean Spicer in a few months.”The move paid off for Spicer, a figure well known to Washington journalists who’ll be covering the Trump White House. Though Spicer has longstanding relationships with many reporters, he isn’t shy about aggressively challenging their reporting and analysis on television and social media ― and even in person. During a Politico event last week, Spicer said the publication, in many cases, covers Republicans in a “tweet-happy” style that’s “devoid of facts.”Spicer was named Thursday along with other members of the senior communications team. Hope Hicks, who was Trump’s lone spokesperson for a long stretch of the 2016 election, will be director of strategic communications. Jason Miller will be director of communications, and Dan Scavino was named director social media. All four also hold the title of assistant to the president. “Sean, Hope, Jason and Dan have been key members of my team during the campaign and transition,” Trump said in a statement. “I am excited they will be leading the team that will communicate my agenda that will Make America Great Again.”Spicer also thanked the president-elect on Twitter. White House Correspondents’ Association President Jeff Mason congratulated the newly appointed communications team on Thursday and said the organization looked “forward to working with all of them in the months ahead.”There are sure to be many conversations, and possibly disputes, as the Trump administration settles in. The Trump team is reassessing some established customs in how the White House engages the press, a continuation of Trump’s precedent-breaking behavior during the campaign. The Trump campaign blacklisted several news outlets, and the Republican nominee repeatedly attacked the media and threatened legal actions against news organizations. As president-elect, Trump has broken with tradition by limiting “protective pool” access and not holding a news conference. In searching for a press secretary, the Trump transition team considered some unconventional picks, including Laura Ingraham, a conservative radio host and Fox News contributor with a history of criticizing the news media, and Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle. The Trump team also interviewed Daily Mail U.S. political editor David Martosko, who emphasized the need to reimagine the press operation and look beyond established players in the briefing room, according to sources familiar with the discussions. Martosko suggested renaming the position “White House news secretary” and the press office “White House Office of News and Information.”Even without such a symbolic shift, key figures in the transition have indicated that change is coming. Reince Priebus, the incoming White House chief of staff and Spicer’s former boss at the RNC, said last week that the Trump team is re-examining customs like the daily press briefing and seating arrangement. During an interview Thursday on Fox News, Spicer said Trump won’t kick out news outlets in response to negative coverage, a serious concern given that the campaign denied press credentials to nearly a dozen news outlets, including The Huffington Post. Still, Spicer said the incoming White House will “look at at everything” and it may not be necessary to hold daily briefings or continue the practice of televising them.The next day, on stage at a Politico event, Spicer said there should be more ways for the public to communicate with the White House press office and suggested the media pecking order in the briefing room should be reassessed. “For too long, I think that we’ve had this very stale operation, which is all the mainstream media folks get front row seats, and it’s a question of, here are the broadcast networks, here’s The Washington Post, The New York Times,” Spicer said. “What about some of the conservative media having some of the prized seats in there?” he asked. “What about having some of the top bloggers being able to come in?Spicer demurred when asked who he’d like to see in the front row, but suggested sought-after spots could rotate or be available on a first-come, first-served basis. “There should be a conversation,” Spicer said. “It shouldn’t just be, ‘Hey, here’s the status quo, let’s keep going.’”This article has been updated to include a comment from the White House Correspondents’ Association president."

DeVos is a big supporter of school voucher programs. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585b4d4b1800002c00e4407c.jpeg?cache=yLXSpdSlnP&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When it comes to religious education, President-elect Donald Trump could be a boon not only for the groups that cheered on his campaign, like evangelical Christians, but also for those he antagonized, like Muslims. One of Trump’s signature plans for education involves expanding school voucher programs, which allow students to use public funding to attend private schools. These types of programs often help religious schools ― in states with widespread voucher programs, like Indiana and North Carolina, many Christian schools and a few Muslim schools benefit. Representatives from Christian, Catholic and Orthodox Jewish groups that advocate for school choice and voucher programs told The Huffington Post that they are looking forward to seeing Trump’s plans in action. However, a representative from a group that works with private Muslim schools said the issue is more complicated for her community.Trump’s presidency might be good for the health of private, religious education in general, said Karen Keyworth, executive director of the Islamic Schools League of America. But even if certain policies seem like they could help Muslim schools thrive, she said there’s no guarantee they will ― and that the Trump administration could negatively affect Muslim children overall.During his campaign, Trump proposed a ban on Muslim immigration to the United States and has floated the idea of making Muslims in America sign up for a registry. His rhetoric has stoked bigotry against Muslim Americans, according to Keyworth, whose organization provides resources to Muslim schools and educators. “Trump and the people he is selecting are very openly anti-Islamic so we do not believe they are going to do anything for our schools,” she said. “On the other hand, having somebody who is more private school-oriented is always a good thing for private schools and we are private schools.”“This is a mixed bag for us ― we would welcome more opportunity for private schools, but if anybody’s going to tell us we’re not involved in that pool of opportunity, we’re going to have a problem with that,” she added. Private Muslim schools have been the targets of Islamophobia in the past. Some legislators have even soured on the idea of school voucher programs once they found out that these initiatives can benefit Muslim schools. A Louisiana state representative walked back her support for a school voucher program in 2012 after she realized it would allow families to use public money to attend Muslim schools in the state. “Unfortunately it will not be limited to the Founders’ religion,” Louisiana state Rep. Valarie Hodges told local outlet Livingston Parish News at the time, referring to her disappointment in discovering that vouchers did not exclusively support Christian schools. “I do not support using public funds for teaching Islam anywhere here in Louisiana.”Conservative lawmakers in Tennessee expressed similar concerns the following year.Overall, Muslim schools represent a small portion of private, religious schools. There are only about 300 Muslim schools in the U.S., Keyworth said. Thirteen states and the District of Columbia have school voucher programs, and 17 states have scholarship tax credit programs that also funnel taxpayer money into private schools, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Typically, a family needs to have a child with special needs or an income below a certain benchmark to qualify for vouchers. The idea behind this system is that disadvantaged kids should be given the same choices about where to attend school as wealthy children. However, some studies show that these programs yield mixed academic results and don’t necessarily offer tremendous educational gains. Critics also contend that they siphon money away from public schools and are an attack on the separation of church and state.Betsy DeVos, who Trump has nominated to be secretary of education, is a huge supporter of both school voucher programs and Christian education. DeVos ― who comes from a billionaire Michigan family ― is a devout Christian and has gone on record saying she uses education philanthropy to promote “greater Kingdom gain.”Leaders from groups that represent some religious schools cheered her nomination. For example, an executive director of an Orthodox Jewish advocacy group noted that the high costs of private schools are a major concern for his community, and school choice options help alleviate some of this burden.Keyworth, however, is more wary of DeVos.“Anyone [Trump] promotes is going to be viewed with mistrust,” she said. ――Rebecca Klein covers the challenges faced in school discipline, school segregation and the achievement gap in K-12 education.

William Barber says he will ask the national NAACP for a boycott of North Carolina.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585c1fdb1600002400bdf3dc.jpeg?cache=gYN94mVWRS&ops=crop_26_155_6753_3916%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"The Rev. William Barber, head of the North Carolina NAACP and a leading voice on civil rights, is calling for a national economic boycott of his state due in part to its General Assembly’s failure to repeal the anti-LGBTQ law known as HB2. “We did it in South Carolina when they raised the Confederate flag,” he said. “We must do it, we believe, as this new legislature is trying to raise a new Confederacy, in policy, right here in North Carolina.” Barber said Thursday that his chapter would draft a letter to the national board of the NAACP later this month and ask for a boycott.The General Assembly spent more than nine hours meeting in a special session on Wednesday to consider repealing HB2, which bars cities and localities from enacting anti-discrimination policies that protect people on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. It also prevents schools from allowing transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds with their gender identity rather than the gender assigned to them at birth. Although many people on both sides of the aisle were hopeful that the controversial law ― which has cost the state millions in lost revenue ― would finally be gone, it remains on the books. Democrats expected the Republican majority to present a clean repeal bill. Instead, however, Republicans added an extra provision barring localities from making changes to ordinances regarding employment and public accommodations for six months. In other words, HB2 would essentially have remained in place for at least six more months.Barber emphasized that the fight over HB2 is about more than bathrooms. The law also keeps cities and localities from setting minimum wage standards for private employers, for example. “We’re not supposed to pass unjust laws that hurt the poor, and hurt children, and hurt women. It’s wrong,” Barber said. Barber is also taking aim at the GOP-controlled legislature’s last-minute maneuvering to strip Gov.-elect Roy Cooper (D) of power when he takes over for Republican Gov. Pat McCrory in the new year. One of the bills reduces the governor’s power over the state Board of Elections and makes it harder for the panel to take action ― a move that could curtail voting rights.The North Carolina NAACP said its boycott proposal will be based on a full repeal of the Board of Elections bill, a full repeal of HB2 and a fair and constitutional redrawing of the state’s legislative districts.North Carolina has already been facing a bit of a national boycott since McCrory signed HB2 in March. The NBA pulled its All-Star Game from the state, PayPal canceled plans to add 400 jobs there, and numerous other business and individuals decided not to expand to or hold events in North Carolina.Cooper’s spokesman did not return a request for comment on a possible boycott.Republicans in North Carolina have blamed Charlotte for HB2, saying they had to pass the law after the city expanded its nondiscrimination ordinance to include protections for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community.In what was supposed to be a compromise deal, Charlotte agreed to rescind its ordinance this week ― and in return, McCrory agreed to call the legislature back for a special session to take up the repeal of HB2. But on Wednesday, Democrats and Republicans couldn’t agree on what would repeal would look like, with some members of the GOP caucus reportedly against any repeal. The General Assembly adjourned for the year with no action.Want more updates from Amanda Terkel? Sign up for her newsletter, Piping Hot Truth, here."
10,POLITICS,Jewish Family Fears For Safety After Conservative Media Blames Them For Christmas Play Cancellation (UPDATE),Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/christmas-play-cancellation_us_585bfce6e4b0eb58648563ef,The school says it absolutely did not cancel the production because of religious complaints.,2016-12-22,The parents of a fifth grader say that they never asked for the play to be canceled or complained about it; they simply asked for their child to be excused and were told that was fine.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585bfda71800002c00e441be.jpeg?cache=iMLkmv9kCL&ops=crop_4_150_1996_1200%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"A Jewish family in Pennsylvania says it fears for its safety after media outlets across the country ran stories blaming them for the cancellation of a Christmas play.Local station WHTM reported last week that Centerville Elementary School in Lancaster decided not to put on its production of “A Christmas Carol” this year after two parents complained to the them about the famous line, “God bless us, everyone.” The school had been doing the play for more than 40 years. But the controversy really took off after conservative outlets including Fox News, Breitbart News and The Blaze picked up the report and gave it national attention.WHTM said school officials told the news outlet the play was not canceled because of complaints about that line, although “many parents” believed it was so. The Fox News commentary piece framed the controversy as part of the so-called “war on Christmas.” “[T]his year, I’m afraid Tiny Tim’s goose has been cooked by the Ghost of Christmas Intolerance,” the article stated. But the Hempfield School District has vehemently denied this account of why it canceled the play, and a Jewish family that says it’s being blamed for the controversy has left the area, according to LancasterOnline. The earlier articles did not identify the family as Jewish or name them, and later reports said the family had just gone on vacation.The parents of a fifth grader in the district told LancasterOnline that they never asked for the play to be canceled or complained about it; they simply asked for their child to be excused and were told that was fine.But they said since the school announced the cancellation last month, classmates had harassed their child. And after the story broke nationally, the school said it received at least 200 phone calls and emails about the play.The family said they were disturbed by some of the comments on the conservative outlets’ stories ― including one on the Breitbart story asking for information about the family’s address.And after a fake news story created an uproar over a pizza place in Washington, D.C. ― which resulted in a man coming in with an assault rifle to “self-investigate” whether there truly was a child sex ring there ― the family said they were afraid for their safety.“There’s no way we’re going to take a chance after the pizza incident,” said the parents, who were not named by LancasterOnline. But on Thursday night, after the LancasterOnline article was widely circulated, the Anti-Defamation League posted a statement saying that it had contacted the family and that it was incorrect to say they had fled the area. “We spoke with the family, who explained that they went on a previously-planned vacation for the holidays,” said ADL Regional Director Nancy Baron-Baer. “Stories like this can sow fear in the Jewish community and beyond, and it is important to stop the spread of misinformation.”Rabbi Jack Paskoff, of a Lancaster reform synagogue, told The Washington Post that although the family are not members of his congregation, he had been in regular touch with them. The child, he said, was being taunted on the bus about the play’s cancellation.“It was getting prevalent enough that the family got concerned,” he said.The Hempfield School District has backed up the family’s account. Officials have posted a FAQ sheet on its website and said the play was absolutely not canceled because of complaints over the “God bless us” line. Instead, they dropped the play because it consumed too much instructional time in the classroom. From the FAQ sheet: The school said the principal also offered to work with parents and staff who were interested in producing the play during after-school hours, but “no one was either able or interested to assist with producing the play after school hours.”“Had the primary concern been with the content of the play,” the school added, “possibilities for continuing the play would not have been sought by Mr. Kramer.”Fox News has long promoted the notion that there’s a war on Christmas (and even a war on Easter). For more than a decade, host Bill O’Reilly has been a leading voice in network commentators’ fomentation that Christians are under attack over political correctness because people say “Happy holidays,” remove nativity scenes from public buildings or do anything to acknowledge that there are people of other religions in America. But even Fox, it seems, isn’t always on the right side.This story has been updated with the ADL’s statement and comments from a local rabbi.Want more updates from Amanda Terkel?

Sleep disturbances can lead to fatigue and sleep-related performance anxieties that in turn affect athletic performance itself, the authors write in the journal Sports Medicine.“Many studies to date have investigated the impact of sleep deprivation, which is the loss of sleep, on health, wellbeing, and aspects of athletic performance,” lead author Luke Gupta told Reuters Health by email. “Little research, however, has looked into sleep quality, which is one’s experience of sleep or perceived sleep adequacy,” said Gupta, a researcher at Loughborough University in the UK.Gupta said he and his coauthors set out to organize the current literature to find out whether aspects of elite sport degrade sleep quality.They reviewed the findings of 37 studies published between 2001 and 2016 that included Olympic, Paralympic, national and professional athletes. Studies had anywhere from six to 2,067 participants, mostly men, ranging in age from 18 to 30 years old.The researchers focused on symptoms of insomnia, which is characterized by trouble falling or staying asleep, the feeling that sleep wasn’t restorative and excessive daytime fatigue.Based on these studies, they conclude that about one third to one half of all elite athletes are poor sleepers, with Paralympic athletes reporting the most insomnia symptoms.“The findings of review revealed high levels of sleep complaints among elite athletes, however, there is little evidence to suggest that these levels are disproportionately higher than those of young, high-achieving non-athletic individuals such as students,” Gupta said.The analysis also highlighted aspects of elite sport that can challenge athlete sleep quality, Gupta said.“Broadly speaking, these include international travel, training due to early morning scheduling and high-intensity periods, and insomnia due to pre-competition worry and late night scheduling,” Gupta said. “However, athletes do not appear to respond uniformly to these challenges with some experiencing severe disturbances whilst others are otherwise unchallenged.”Gupta said that daytime naps appear to be a common way for athletes to deal with sleep disturbances.He also said that worry and anxiety about athletic performance and increased physiological arousal after late competitions could make it difficult for athletes to fall asleep“Delaying bedtimes by employing relaxation strategies in these instances can minimize disruption to sleep quality,” he said.“Evidence is increasing that sleep interventions can improve the quality and extend the duration of athlete sleep,” Emer Van Ryswik a sleep researcher at Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia, who wasn’t involved in the study said in an email.She pointed out that the research studies used in the review were primarily of low quality, as noted by the study authors.“Therefore, higher quality original research is needed in this area before firm conclusions can be drawn,” Van Ryswik said.In a study published in August in the European Journal of Sleep Science, Van Ryswyk and her colleagues describe a sleep optimization program for athletes. Some of the program advice can apply to anyone having sleep troubles: avoid electronic devices right before bed and caffeine or alcohol at night and establish a regular bedtime.In addition, Antic suggests, athletes should do something relaxing when they can’t sleep and should avoid stimulating activities, such as checking Facebook, which would make insomnia worse.SOURCE: bit.ly/2i04XKA Sports Medicine, online November 29, 2016."

But that doesn’t mean people who don’t live in South Florida can’t help out while they declutter: There are many other ways to donate unwanted gifts.Foster programs around the country are always in need of toys and school supplies for children. Find a foster care agency near you here.Schools likewise need learning tools, including computers and other electronics.Video games can be donated to hospitals. Learn about one organization’s efforts here.Donations can also be made to your nearest Goodwill center or Salvation Army drop-off location. You may even be able to schedule a free pickup if your donation is large enough. Many donations are tax-deductible, too.As for those who want to participate in the Miami area Whopper swap, people are asked to bring their unused and unwrapped gifts to the Burger King location along Arthur Godfrey Road between 10:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. on the day after Christmas.“The acceptability of [the] item will be determined by Burger King Restaurant personnel in their sole discretion,” a company spokesperson told the Miami New Times.The Whopper Exchange will also take place at select Burger Kings restaurants in London and Brazil."

A perfect, holy, heterosexual family.Kittredge Cherry, a retired lesbian pastor and author from Los Angeles, is convinced that this image of a traditional family only scratches the surface of the Christmas story. After all, Cherry told The Huffington Post, the Bible claims Jesus himself comes from a very untraditional family ― he technically had two fathers (God and his adoptive dad, Joseph). And she pointed out that Mary gave birth without having sex with a man, not unlike lesbian mothers who use artificial insemination to start their families. So a few years back, Cherry reimagined the nativity scene in a way that challenged the notion of a “traditional family” that is so prized in conservative Christian culture today.Her nativity included two Marys and two Josephs. Cherry said that the 2009 photo series, titled “Love Makes A Holy Family,” was not intended to be historically or biblically accurate, but to challenge people to expand their notions about what a family is, and what it means for Jesus to come from such an untraditional family. Plus, she added, the nativity scene itself is an invention that isn’t biblically accurate. The first nativity scenes emerged more than 1000 years after Jesus’ death. “The conservative Christians of today tend to act like they own the copyright on Jesus and they get mad when someone changes the image and switches the figures around,” Cherry said. “They don’t want to think that Jesus could be one of us, but that was the message of the whole Christmas story ― that God is with us.”Cherry is a retired Christian minister who has spent decades preaching about God’s love for all people, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. She was ordained by the Metropolitan Community Churches, a queer-friendly denomination, and worked in San Francisco during the AIDS crisis of the 1980s. She’s advocated for Christian churches to be more welcoming and inclusive of LGBTQ Christians, and she knows firsthand the damaging effects of a theology that bars them from experiencing family life. Cherry said that Christmas is a time that is especially hard for some queer Christians.“People in the gay and lesbian community feel excluded from the church much of the time,” she said. “Then at Christmastime there’s a lot of depression, because there’s so much emphasis on the church and the family, and a lot of gay and lesbian people have been excluded from their families, or their families won’t let you bring your partner home for Christmas.” Cherry created her nativity scenes in 2009 by purchasing two sets of figures from Amazon and mixing them up. She took photos of the newly formed set, and eventually, decided to sell the images as Christmas cards. While the cards only sell about 100 copies every year, Cherry said her images always tend to provoke much discussion. This year, an artist in California decided to turn her images into ornaments and sell them online, reportedly without Cherry’s permission. The ornaments caught the eye of a conservative Christian group and resulted in a flurry of articles online.Cherry wasn’t expecting her photo series to pop up in the news this year. She said it was an “unexpected gift” to be able to share these images with the world again ― especially considering the challenges that queer Americans will face after President-elect Donald Trump and his vice-president Michael Pence, a conservative Christian, come into office.Below, a YouTube video that Cherry made of her nativity sets. Rev. Anthony Fatta, a United Methodist Church pastor from California, told The Huffington Post it was important to see alternative, queer-friendly versions of the nativity. He believes much homophobia is rooted in heteronormative portrayals of either Adam and Eve or Mary and Joseph. As a result of those narratives, queer kids grow up knowing what it feels like to be left out of certain spaces, like Mary and Joseph were during their search for an inn, or to feel different from everyone else in your family, as Jesus probably felt during his youth.“For American Christians, rethinking and reinterpreting the Nativity scene can help us all realize how broad God’s love is supposed to be,” he told The Huffington Post.Alex McNeill, executive director of the LGBTQ advocacy group More Light Presbyterians, said that Cherry’s interpretation of the nativity speaks to the heart of the Christmas story. “As a queer person, if I don’t see myself anywhere in the narrative of the birth, life, and death of Jesus, it can be hard to imagine that my incarnation as a queer body is included in God’s love,” McNeill said. “A queer Nativity scene pulls me into a sacred imagination of seeing queer bodies as also capable of embodying and working for God’s love made manifest in the world.”Cherry believes that images of queer spirituality are going to be important over the next few years, to counter the conservative Christian agenda that the new administration will push. “It’s going to be important to express that there’s another way to follow Christ and that is the way that embraces all the people that are excluded,” Cherry said. “So I hope [these images] provide not just an alternative view of society but another way to be a Christian.”"

Now, research published in the Journal of Creative Behavior last month finds that creative achievements may serve a positive function for the artist in easing existential anxieties and lessening the fear of death. “I see symbolic immortality as a way to stay alive in one’s culture after one’s physical death,” study lead author Rotem Perach, a psychology Ph.D student at the University of Kent, told The Huffington Post. In a review of 12 previous studies on the subject, the researchers established that creative achievement does seem to play a role in managing anxiety related to the awareness of death. And this is something that even non-artists can tap into, through everyday acts of creative expression. The researchers explain this phenomenon through what’s known as “terror management theory,” a psychological theory proposing that the fear of death is a significant human motivator. The theory suggests that there are two main things we do in order to cope with the awareness of our own mortality. First, we subscribe to a belief system (such as a religion or set of moral principles) that provides us with a sense of meaning and order. Then we strive to cultivate high self-esteem by living up to the standards of value that our culture sets. Long-lasting creative achievements are one way to become valuable to the culture at large. “As a valuable contributor to something larger, more meaningful, and longer lasting than mere physical existence, one gains the protection from mortality concerns offered by the culture,” the study’s authors write.The researchers conducted their own experiment on a group of 108 students. They asked the students to fill out assessments of their own creative activities, achievements and goals. These included answering questions about whether they aspired to produce a great creative work or to make an important contribution to a field within the arts or sciences.Then, the students were asked to agree or disagree with a series of statements either about death anxiety (such as “I am very much afraid to die”) or fear of public speaking. Finally, they completed a task of filling in words that could either death-related or non-death-related, and the researchers analyzed how many times they chose death-centric words. The students who were more creativity-oriented chose more death-related words, but for those who had already had a major creativity achievement or expressed a strong desire to make a creative impact in the future, their thinking was actually less death-oriented. The researchers concluded that creative achievements have a positive existential value for those who hold creativity in high regard. “Understanding the existential meanings of an enduring creative achievement may be particularly valuable for expert creative persons,” they wrote, “as they navigate motivational and creative challenges en route to eminence.”"

Maintaining direct eye contact really is strenuous for the brain, according to new research, and it uses up scarce cognitive resources that we need for things like reasoning and verbal processing. There are many reasons for avoiding eye contact ― social anxiety, being lost in thought, or feeling strong emotions like guilt or embarrassment ― but sometimes we drop another’s gaze simply because it’s too mentally taxing. A Japanese study published in the December issue of the journal Cognition found there is some interference between eye contact and verbal processing in the brain, which may be why we periodically avert our eyes during conversations. The researchers found that eye contact uses the same mental resources as complex reasoning ― so, when carrying on a conversation that requires us to reason, we may periodically drop eye contact as a way to conserve those cognitive resources. In other words, maintaining eye contact can take a lot of effort. “Although eye contact and verbal processing appear independent, people frequently avert their eyes from interlocutors during conversation,” the study authors wrote. “This suggests that there is interference between these processes.”For the study, participants were asked to watch a video screen with a person’s face on it, and were asked to stare into the person’s eyes continuously as they performed a verbal task. Sometimes, the eyes on the screen were directed toward the participant, and other times the eyes looked to the side. Over time, the verbal task was made more complex and difficult. When the task was still easy, making eye contact with the face on the screen did not affect the participants’ performance. But when the task became more difficult, their performance was hindered by direct eye contact with the face on the screen.Eye contact made the participants struggle to perform complex tasks. This seems to be because the brain becomes bogged down with competing demands, and cognitive resources needed for reasoning were diverted in order to maintain eye contact. Other studies have shown that eye contact can interfere with visual thinking, but the new research is the first to show that the interference related to eye contact goes beyond visual thinking to more general cognitive processes as well. So, if you need to have an important conversation with a friend or co-worker, try doing it while walking, rather than sitting face to face. You might find that it’s easier for you to express your thoughts and ideas without too much eye contact distracting you. "

Takei has a highly personal reason to take issue with Trump’s tweet. Members of his family were living in Hiroshima during WWII, when the U.S. dropped a nuclear bomb on the city on Aug. 6, 1945, killing thousands instantly and some 140,000 by the end of the year. Takei’s aunt and cousin were among those who lost their lives, “found burnt in a ditch in Hiroshima,” the actor wrote. “These weapons must go.”Earlier this year, Barack Obama became the first U.S. president to visit Hiroshima, where he mourned the lives lost and called for an end to nuclear weapons.“Amongst those nations like my own that own nuclear stockpiles, we must have the courage to escape the logic of fear and pursue a world without them,” Obama said in a speech.In an opinion piece for The Guardian, published in May, Takei praised Obama’s visit to Hiroshima.“I share Obama’s call for a nuclear-free world,” he wrote. “We must pledge to work closely with other powers, to reduce not only the number of weapons in our arsenals, but also the numbers of states bearing or seeking to bear them.”"

Instead, he placed a knife beneath a couch to use against Ruiz later, according to an affidavit obtained by The Huffington Post. Jones’ father said he tried to stop the attack, but the suspect managed to stab Ruiz multiple times before fleeing the scene. Police and EMS arrived on the scene and performed first aid on Ruiz before taking her to a local hospital, where she died a few hours later.Authorities said Jones was found a short time later lying naked in the grass three blocks away from the crime scene, according to KTBC TV.Jones allegedly told investigators he has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and stopped taking his prescribed medications two years ago, because he felt that they would ‘slow him down.’”Jones is currently being held at the Travis County Jail on a $500,000 bail, according to jail records.

Like really hard. And we’d just like to skip the festivities this year.In the fall of 2012, I accidentally got pregnant. “Accidentally” meaning it was not planned. Not “accidentally” like I didn’t know how babies were made. Please do not email me and offer to explain.In 5th grade, my mom showed my sister and I what a condom was and how to put one on and I’ve never been the same since. Plus, the giggling that came out of my younger sister’s mouth still haunts my nightmares. She used to laugh like a hyena on crack.We had not planned on more children and were shocked at the positive pregnancy tests. But by Christmas time, we were starting to get excited and spent holiday gatherings telling our families. Everyone knew we were good with two and so surprising everyone with third Graham baby news was really fun.Then in January I had a miscarriage.It was long and drawn out and knocked me on my butt hard. I drank a lot of wine and ate a lot of cheese in January. I wore lots of black and acted very French, apparently. If I could have found one of those really long cigarette holders I totally would have used it. I don’t smoke, but maybe I would have taken it up? Who knows.Because life is cruel and the world doesn’t care, everything else went on and so I did too. But when Christmas rolled around the next year, sadness and emptiness hit fast and hard. I didn’t see it coming. Most days I didn’t think about our loss because I am really good at blocking bad stuff out. I think it’s called denial, I am not sure.But that Christmas, we should have had a baby. Christmas was when we shared our good news. Christmas was here and we were one short.It shocked how much it hurt again. I wasn’t prepared for the sudden, intense hurt to come back so strong. I thought we were moving on.This year has been hard for people I love. Two of them have said out loud I was raped. Babies have died. Spouses have died. Divorces have divided families. It’s the first holiday season for some, like my family, without larger-than-life grandparents.This Christmas season looks pretty on Instagram and Facebook but there’s a lot of pain here too. I know the feeling all too well of just wishing this holiday would pass because there’s too much family time and celebrating, too much cheer and down time. Because it’s during the quiet that sadness creeps in and takes over. Because a routine and work and errands and meetings fill things, distract minds, and make the hurt less noticeable.It’s still there though, settled in for the long haul like those twenty pounds you really want to lose, but you sometimes forget about it if you’re busy and wearing stretchy pants.But when you’ve got time to sit and reflect and eat the dessert with Grandma, then you realize your pants are too tight. Or your broken heart is overwhelming you. So then you’re uncomfortable and sad and just want to get out of the house. Or the pants. I sorta got lost on that metaphor so you’re just going to need to trust me that it makes sense.I have a friend who had a miscarriage recently. I think about her a lot and really want to reach out to let her know I love her and am thinking about the baby she won’t get to meet until heaven; to let her know she isn’t alone if sadness and maybe anger show up this Christmas instead of joy and cheer.But I haven’t said these things to her because there is a small, self-conscious part of me that thinks I might just be bringing up something unpleasant for her and that would be rude.I know that is completely false because my fear of bringing it up implies that it went somewhere, that it left.It didn’t go anywhere.It’s there all the time. Loss of life, loss of relationship, loss of innocence, it doesn’t leave. It shapes and molds you into something different and, at times, unrecognizable. It’s there whether we say it out loud or not.So for Christmas this year, let’s say it out loud. Let’s say that we’re hurting and we need help. Let’s say that this is hard and it feels like too much. And let’s not be afraid to ask how others are doing and to really, truly listen to what the answer is.Merry Christmas, even if it’s hard."

After many gyrations, it was shot down due to “lack of funding”. The course focuses on the intersectional politics of secularism, atheism and humanism, as well as the work of secularists of color like Anthony Pinn, Mandisa Thomas, Heina Dadabhoy, Juhem Navarro Rivera, Sincere Kirabo, Candace Gorham and the D.C. group Secular Sistahs. The uptick in Americans identifying as secular Nones has led to the creation of more secular courses, many of which are housed in Religious Studies departments. Despite the much ballyhooed “Rise of the Nones” there is currently only one bonafide Secular Studies department (based at Pitzer College and helmed by secular scholar Phil Zuckerman) in the U.S. For the most part, Secularism in the American academy is a cobbled together affair, featuring one-off courses dominated by white academics with the book contracts, privilege and ivory tower “cred” to do secular work without worrying about censure or professional ostracism. Although social media bustle with black folks tweeting, blogging and sounding off about embracing atheism; the same handful of white faces preside in the academic industrial complex as “authentic” scholars of the secular, atheist, humanist experience. As a result, scholarship, classes and curricula that capture the lived experiences, politics and world views of secularists of color, especially those of women of color, are still scant to nonexistent. To date, the Humanist Institute is the only organization in the country to feature an online course I developed entitled “Women of Color Beyond Faith”.Why is it important that secular people of color teach, write and publish book length scholarship, analyses, narratives and fiction on our social history? The hijacking of rock music from the African American composers and musicians who originated the genre is a case in point. African American scholar/historians like Maureen Mahon and Jeffrey Othello are among the few in the white male dominated field of rock and roll musicology and music history. This dearth, combined with the whitewashing of rock by white male critics, musicians and the music industry, has ironically marked the genre as “in-authentically” black. Recent critical works by white writers like Jack Hamilton and Gayle Wald document the travails of African American rock artists in a field black folk pioneered but are now viewed as oxymoronic in (one need look no further than the lily white bands in this year’s crop of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees to see how white supremacy informs the corporate rock establishment). The lockstep association of “black music” with rap, hip hop and R&B continues to marginalize black rock musicians. That said, if it’s black and obscure, white folk will find it, document it, and anthropologically “redeem” it for the masses as valid art and noble artifact. It’s no revelation that white validation is often the primary criterion for legitimizing black cultural production, critical theory or art in the mainstream and in academia. As August Wilson once noted, “Blacks have traditionally had to operate in a situation where whites have set themselves up as custodians of the black experience.”When it comes to secularism, even when secular people of color appear in academic spaces, the range of lived experience that they are allowed to represent is limited and reductive. The standard caricature that bubbles up into mainstream consciousness is one of smug atheist blacks and Latinos condemning God and Tyler Perry-esque evangelicalism among folk of color. Rejecting religion becomes an end in and of itself, and not merely symbolic of a more politicized belief system based on social justice, ethics, black liberation, black feminism and serving black communities within the context of heightened anti-black state violence, segregation and misogynoir. Because black bodies have always signified an irrational supernaturalism positioned as the antithesis of the Western universal subject, black humanist atheist praxis can upend traditional constructions of racial authenticity and identity.Similarly, black lived experience, faith and secularism are largely MIA in the literary arts; be it narrative film, theatre or fiction. While questioning faith is a familiar theme in these genres (e.g. in August Wilson’s Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom, Lorraine Hansberry’s Raisin in the Sun and James Baldwin’s Go Tell it On the Mountain), politicized rejection of supernaturalism and religion, as a sustained critical theme in fictional works by black authors, is still rare. Indeed, only the works of Richard Wright (Black Boy and The Outsider) and Nella Larsen (Quicksand) occupy this space of aesthetic and ideological possibility. Often in black cultural production, there is the presumption of faith-based, religious or spiritual world views and experiences that preclude more complex portrayals of black life. The straightjacket of faith, spiritualism and religiosity is particularly problematic when it comes to black women characters who are allowed none of the nuances of belief and individual license afforded “maverick” male characters. Fictional black women who espouse atheism outright are either punished as traitors (Beneatha Younger in Raisin in the Sun) or domesticated and suppressed (Helga Crane in Quicksand).This brand of gender policing is even more pronounced in mainstream TV and film. Browse the array of popular—often straight-to-video—black films in the few video stores that remain and the majority feature stereotypically melodramatic tropes of sex, faith, relationships and family woes that are presumably designed to appeal to all black women. In his article “Black Atheists in Film and TV”, Black Skeptics Los Angeles writer and attorney D. Frederick Sparks identifies a handful of portrayals, noting the dearth of black women and the latitude allowed black men (a situation reflected in a recent episode of the sitcom Black-ish, which tamely explored the lead characters’ eldest daughter questioning God’s existence). This erasure will become even more insidious as evangelical Trumpist white America reloads and reboots. The rising tide of reactionary Religious Right legislation against racial justice, LGBTQI rights, women’s rights, reproductive justice, public education and climate change demands concerted response and resistance from secular radicals and progressives. Countering the literary and academic whiteness of secular space and secular studies is another form of critical resistance in this neo-fascist era.Twitter @sikivuhutch"

Despite the much ballyhooed “Rise of the Nones” there is currently only one bonafide Secular Studies department (based at Pitzer College and helmed by secular scholar Phil Zuckerman) in the U.S. For the most part, Secularism in the American academy is a cobbled together affair, featuring one-off courses dominated by white academics with the book contracts, privilege and ivory tower “cred” to do secular work without worrying about censure or professional ostracism. Although social media bustle with black folks tweeting, blogging and sounding off about embracing atheism; the same handful of white faces preside in the academic industrial complex as “authentic” scholars of the secular, atheist, humanist experience. As a result, scholarship, classes and curricula that capture the lived experiences, politics and world views of secularists of color, especially those of women of color, are still scant to nonexistent. To date, the Humanist Institute is the only organization in the country to feature an online course I developed entitled “Women of Color Beyond Faith”.Why is it important that secular people of color teach, write and publish book length scholarship, analyses, narratives and fiction on our social history? The hijacking of rock music from the African American composers and musicians who originated the genre is a case in point. African American scholar/historians like Maureen Mahon and Jeffrey Othello are among the few in the white male dominated field of rock and roll musicology and music history. This dearth, combined with the whitewashing of rock by white male critics, musicians and the music industry, has ironically marked the genre as “in-authentically” black. Recent critical works by white writers like Jack Hamilton and Gayle Wald document the travails of African American rock artists in a field black folk pioneered but are now viewed as oxymoronic in (one need look no further than the lily white bands in this year’s crop of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees to see how white supremacy informs the corporate rock establishment). The lockstep association of “black music” with rap, hip hop and R&B continues to marginalize black rock musicians. That said, if it’s black and obscure, white folk will find it, document it, and anthropologically “redeem” it for the masses as valid art and noble artifact. It’s no revelation that white validation is often the primary criterion for legitimizing black cultural production, critical theory or art in the mainstream and in academia. As August Wilson once noted, “Blacks have traditionally had to operate in a situation where whites have set themselves up as custodians of the black experience.”When it comes to secularism, even when secular people of color appear in academic spaces, the range of lived experience that they are allowed to represent is limited and reductive. The standard caricature that bubbles up into mainstream consciousness is one of smug atheist blacks and Latinos condemning God and Tyler Perry-esque evangelicalism among folk of color. Rejecting religion becomes an end in and of itself, and not merely symbolic of a more politicized belief system based on social justice, ethics, black liberation, black feminism and serving black communities within the context of heightened anti-black state violence, segregation and misogynoir. Because black bodies have always signified an irrational supernaturalism positioned as the antithesis of the Western universal subject, black humanist atheist praxis can upend traditional constructions of racial authenticity and identity.Similarly, black lived experience, faith and secularism are largely MIA in the literary arts; be it narrative film, theatre or fiction. While questioning faith is a familiar theme in these genres (e.g. in August Wilson’s Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom, Lorraine Hansberry’s Raisin in the Sun and James Baldwin’s Go Tell it On the Mountain), politicized rejection of supernaturalism and religion, as a sustained critical theme in fictional works by black authors, is still rare. Indeed, only the works of Richard Wright (Black Boy and The Outsider) and Nella Larsen (Quicksand) occupy this space of aesthetic and ideological possibility. Often in black cultural production, there is the presumption of faith-based, religious or spiritual world views and experiences that preclude more complex portrayals of black life. The straightjacket of faith, spiritualism and religiosity is particularly problematic when it comes to black women characters who are allowed none of the nuances of belief and individual license afforded “maverick” male characters. Fictional black women who espouse atheism outright are either punished as traitors (Beneatha Younger in Raisin in the Sun) or domesticated and suppressed (Helga Crane in Quicksand).This brand of gender policing is even more pronounced in mainstream TV and film. Browse the array of popular—often straight-to-video—black films in the few video stores that remain and the majority feature stereotypically melodramatic tropes of sex, faith, relationships and family woes that are presumably designed to appeal to all black women. In his article “Black Atheists in Film and TV”, Black Skeptics Los Angeles writer and attorney D. Frederick Sparks identifies a handful of portrayals, noting the dearth of black women and the latitude allowed black men (a situation reflected in a recent episode of the sitcom Black-ish, which tamely explored the lead characters’ eldest daughter questioning God’s existence). This erasure will become even more insidious as evangelical Trumpist white America reloads and reboots. The rising tide of reactionary Religious Right legislation against racial justice, LGBTQI rights, women’s rights, reproductive justice, public education and climate change demands concerted response and resistance from secular radicals and progressives. Countering the literary and academic whiteness of secular space and secular studies is another form of critical resistance in this neo-fascist era.Twitter @sikivuhutch"

Ashley Pipari is a Senior double major in Communication and Political Science at the University of Delaware. She wrote this blog just days after the Election, thinking of her future children and how to explain this to them.Read more student voices from the University of Delaware on my #BlogBlogProject.―――――――――――Dear Future Children,Please know that I believe in the United States democracy crafted by our founding fathers. I believe in the Constitution. I believe in the voice that each person has when casting his or her vote. I believe that we are all equal, even when society says we are not.I believe that to make justified, well-educated decisions we must listen open-mindedly listen to both sides of an issue. Most importantly, I believe that regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, and class, we have the power to change the world if we choose to. This has changed recently when Donald Trump became elected the 45th president of the United States.When I cast my vote on November 8th, I thought I would one day be able to tell you that I played a part in making history; that I helped elect our first female president. It is with great sadness that I cannot tell you that.I’ve sat and thought quite a bit since then as to what I would tell you. At first I thought I wanted to tell you how sorry I was that I could not tell you that we had once again broken the glass-ceiling. I thought I would tell you that it was with a heavy heart that I lost faith in our country. I thought I would spent countless words explaining to you how I lived through a period where misogyny and racism were more blatantly apparent than ever before. I thought I would remind you that no matter how much society beats you down and tells you that you’re not good enough, not rich enough, not pretty or handsome enough, or not smart enough, that I believe you are.I thought I’d have to explain to you that these words would come from people around you in school, on the streets, at the store, and more importantly, from the media and “President Trump.” But I have chosen to tell you otherwise.Instead of apologizing, I want to teach you to be better because that is the type of person I wish that you become. You deserve better, and furthermore, our country and the American people deserve better. We cannot let the words spewed by “President Trump” define who we are.Instead, we will rise above it. Michelle Obama, our former First Lady, once said “when they go low, we go high.” I refuse to let growing up in a hateful society make you a hateful person. I want you to make the world a better place. I want you to feel loved and accepted is so that you can impress those same feelings upon others. I want to instill values upon you that allow you to accept others regardless of their opinions, political ideology, socioeconomic status, race, gender, or sexual orientation. More importantly, I want you to love and respect yourself so that you can love and respect others.The 2016 presidential election is one that will be discussed in your history classes. The race between Republican candidate Donald Trump and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was full of nasty, nasty hate speech.The policies, or goals, for future America were never discussed, but the spewing of hate speech came from both sides. With you, I wish to instill that you learn from this historical battle. I hope you never feel the overwhelming anxiety that today’s children are feeling. I hope that you can go to school and make friends with anyone and everyone, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, and political ideology. I hope that your classrooms are a place for constructive conversations rather than bullying and divisive hate speech.I hope that you feel empowered with words of constructive love rather than divisive hate. I hope that you strive to be the change that you, and I, wish to see in the world. That’s what I hope.I hope that you learn “President Trump” was just you and me. “President Trump” sat in classrooms and learned the same material. “President Trump” wasn’t born into the world with this hate, but he was rather taught how to hate by society. It is my goal to instill that I keep hate out of your hearts and rather fill them with love and optimism.I strive to see you make changes and work hard for the things you want in life rather than expect them to be handed to you. I seek to see your heart fill with joy when you make a change, and I hope that joy lasts forever. I hope to create an environment where hate doesn’t exist for you nor is it created by you. Believe me, I don’t agree or even like everything “President Trump” says or does, but rather than be offended by it, I mobilize to change it.I seek to find ways to spew love in the same places he spews hate. I realize that changing one person could ultimately change the world. I hope to see you embark on journeys in your life where you accept everyone that comes near you rather than push them away for irrelevant reasons.In the eyes of despair, I will fight for you to see hope. I want you to shine your light on the world and show what it is like to love and be loved in return. I hope you know that regardless of the factors surrounding you, that you are the same as the little boy or girl sitting next to you in the classroom- you are no better and you are no worse.I hope you know that you were put in this world for a reason and I hope that you strive to find the good in world and show love to all. I hope that you don’t let the words of society harden you, but you let your words soften the hearts of those around you.Be the change you wish to see in the world. Show love, kindness, and acceptance, rather than hate, bigotry, and rejection. Make friends with anyone and everyone. Pursue your passions. An act of kindness can go a long way, and I hope that you can one day see that.I will instill these values in it, and one day I hope you realize what a difference you’ve made in your own life and the lives of those around you. You have the ability to make the world a better place, but that starts by learning to love yourself so you can love those around you (Just watch Hillary Clinton’s Concession Speech).In the current time of despair, I write this to you with a heart of hope. “President Trump” has yet to take his Oath of Office, but when he does, I will still hold this hope. I will hope that I can instill values in you to make differences in the world, both big and small.I hope that you will not let defeat or divisive talk change you, but you will find this as a mechanism to spread hope and kindness. Amid the fear of a Donald Trump presidency, I have hope that you will one day be the difference I wish to see and strive so hard for in this world.Love Always, Your Hopeful Mother―――――――――――This blog was written for a class taught by Dr. Lindsay Hoffman by Ashley Pipari, University of Delaware, 2016.I will continue publishing student blogs as well as my own perspectives here at http://www.huffingtonpost.com/author/lindsayh-183."
26,RELIGION,The “Christian State” Captures The White House,"Tim Rymel, M.Ed., ContributorAuthor | Educator | Dad",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-christian-state-captures-the-white-house_us_585c50eae4b04d7df167ce6e,"Though only 25.4 percent of U.S. Christians identify as evangelicals, the evangelical impact is profound and far-reaching",2016-12-22,"<p>“What has become clear is that the powerful and political religious right is no longer about preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Instead, they are determined to remove protections from those in society who need them most.”</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585c53081800001800e44320.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Though only 25.4 percent of U.S. Christians identify as evangelicals, the evangelical impact is profound and far-reaching. Religious fundamentalist Senators Ted Cruz and Mike Lee announced their plan to reintroduce the First Amendment Defense Act (FADA) to congress. Though it failed to pass in 2015, with a Republican controlled House and Senate, there is a good chance it can pass this time around. Evangelical puppet, Donald Trump, has vowed to sign it.FADA effectively allows for discrimination against LGBT people, as well as heterosexuals who are assumed to be having sex outside of marriage. The federal government is prohibited “from taking discriminatory action against a person on the basis that such person believes or acts in accordance with a religious belief or moral conviction.”This is not the first time we’ve seen such bills. Following the passage of marriage equality, Mississippi created a bill allowing businesses to discriminate against LGBT people. North Carolina passed “the bathroom bill,” which forced transgender people to use the bathroom according to the gender on their birth certificate, as well as, prohibited cities within the state from creating protections for LGBT people beyond the states own discrimination laws. Tennessee created its own “bathroom” law and told mental health professionals they could refuse to serve LGBT people altogether.Family Research Council’s Tony Perkins stated that Trump’s administration needs to “ferret out” what he called LGBT “activists” in the state department and replace them with “conservatives who will ensure the State Department focuses on true international human rights like religious liberty, which is under unprecedented assault.”Focus on the Family’s James Dobson, when interviewed prior to the election said, “I’m convinced that with the wrong president, we will soon see a massive assault on religious liberty.” To ensure that didn’t happen, he latched on to the coattails of the man who stands opposed to nearly everything Dobson preaches, while telling Christianity Today – I assume with a straight face - “I support those who will lead the country righteously, honorably, and wisely.”Franklin Graham joined Trump on his victory tour and said, “Yesterday I had the privilege of joining with thousands of people in Alabama to pray for President-elect Donald J. Trump, Vice President-elect Mike Pence, and to thank God for His hand of blessing on this nation.”Much like the Islamic State, the Christian State remains a fringe group beholden to their version of religion, which cannot stand on its own merit. “Religious liberty,” the golden calf to which they pledge their undying love and support, only applies to their version of religion.Baptist pastor, John Wofford, doesn’t believe Muslims should have the same rights as Christians. He told NPR, “I would like to know how in the world someone within the Southern Baptist Convention can support the defending of rights for Muslims to construct mosques in the United States when these people threaten our very way of existence as Christians and Americans?”Indeed, anyone who disagrees with Wofford, and his version of religion, “threatens” his way of life. Like Graham, Dobson, Perkins, and other fundamentalist Christians, disagreeing with their beliefs is akin to an “assault on religious liberty.”It is impossible to argue against belief. As conservative Barry Goldwater said, “Mark my word, if and when these preachers get control of the [Republican] party, and they’re sure trying to do so, it’s going to be a terrible damn problem. Frankly, these people frighten me. Politics and governing demand compromise. But these Christians believe they are acting in the name of God, so they can’t and won’t compromise.”The Christian State aligned themselves with Donald Trump, knowing he is vulnerable to anyone who strokes his ego and praises his accomplishments. Perhaps they figured this out sooner than some of Trump’s own opponents.But much like Trump, the Christian State operates in fear-based motivation. Trump tapped into Middle America’s fears of immigrants, undocumented workers, and Black Lives Matter. Much of the Christian State’s message has warned adherents on the dangers of marriage equality, abortion, feminism, and sex outside of marriage. Neither is based in reality. Statistics and facts don’t support their suppositions or fears. Presented with such facts angers them and threatens their “religious liberties.”Yet, 48% of lesbian, gay and bisexual Americans identify as Christians. 70.6 of Americans in total also identify as Christians from a multitude of denominations. Fundamentalists have hijacked American politics, much the way Sunni Islamists, as represented by the Islamic State have hijacked politics and policies in the Middle East. Their Sharia Law dictates how people must behave and dress, as well as the punishments for not following “God’s law.” Anyone who opposes their “religious liberties” is simply put to death.What has become clear is that the powerful and political religious right is no longer about preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ. They are not attempting to pass laws that seek protections for the poor, orphans, and widows. Instead, they are determined to remove protections from those in society who need them most. The religious right has aligned itself with big business, big money, and big names to impose their way of life on everyone else for their own self-gain.As Pastor John Pavlovitz said, “[T]his is about supposed representatives of Jesus whoring themselves out just to have what they hope will be the next President’s ear and pretending it’s the work of God. It’s about discarding faith to keep power in their party. It’s about a Christianity that no longer has need or use for Jesus. They themselves are the bloated golden calf they’re bowing down to and Trump is just a means to this end…”"

Trump, now more than ever, it is important to separate truth from fiction, facts from opinion",2016-12-22,"<p>Shoppers in the bazaar in Mashhad, Iran; excited to meet an American</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585bd9931600001d00bdf298.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"With the election of Donald J. Trump, now more than ever, it is important to separate truth from fiction, facts from opinion, and to question prejudices and misconceptions. This directive applies in all areas of life, but perhaps no place on earth is more misunderstood, and worth a re-examination, than the country of Iran; particularly as U.S.-Iran relations enter a new phase of uncertainty.On the whole, Americans tend to view Iran as a backward country, mired in extremism and averse to modernity. Anyone who travels there is considered crazy – or even suspicious.I should know. I am a Jewish-American woman who recently traveled to Iran alone for 10 days with the express goal of proving that - contrary to expectation - the country is safe, beautiful, and welcoming to Americans. Before my travel, I had to explain to friends and family that there are no roaming hordes of ISIS militants in Iran; upon my return, I had to convince members of U.S. Homeland Security that I was not a terrorist sympathizer during nearly two hours of detention and questioning. In addition to being a Jewish-American woman, I am also the Director of Operations at the American Iranian Council, a non-profit organization that works to improve U.S.-Iran relations by promoting dialogue and intercultural understanding. In this role, I recognize that a negative public opinion of Iran (exemplified by my experiences with friends, family and members of Homeland Security) can directly affect the course of policy-making, emboldening politicians to use red-meat rhetoric and speak about Iran as our irreconcilable enemy. Since a more peaceful world starts with strong intercultural understanding and an informed citizenry, combating misinformation about Iran is vital. There are too many misconceptions about Iran to address here, but let me raise a few facts in light of my recent visit, that may be surprising to some readers:Iranians love American tourists. I cannot express this enough. This was my third visit to Iran, and no different than prior experiences in terms of the overwhelmingly positive response that I received from the Iranian people, who enthusiastically express their hope and strong desire for rapprochement with the West. I often say that if you want to be treated like a rock star, you should travel to Iran as an American tourist. On my first visit in 1999, Iranians regularly requested my autograph; this time it was selfies. While the revolutionary line is officially anti-American, I even met a member of the notorious “Basij” on my latest trip, who ― when I told him where I was from ― was so excited, he gave me a free jar of honey (which he was selling) to express his affection for the United States and hope that I would view Iran more positively.Iran is a safe place to visit. Contrary to the belief of many Americans (including some of my friends who actually inquired whether my head would be “chopped off in a YouTube video”): ISIS doesn’t hold territory in Iran; ISIS follows a warped version of Sunni Islam, and Iran is a primarily Shia country. They are enemies and Iran has been helping the US in its fight against ISIS. Further, there have been no major terrorist attacks in Iran. Guns are illegal among the general population and violent crime is extremely low. As a woman, I felt comfortable walking around alone at night in the major cities.Women are educated, drive, vote, and hold senior jobs – many of them in math and science. Iranian women are also incredibly chic; they wear make-up, cute form-fitting manteaus and tight jeans, and many young women barely cover their hair. As a tourist, I have always felt incredibly dowdy by comparison.Iran has the largest Jewish population in the Middle East outside of Israel. There are many functioning synagogues in the country, and Iran’s constitution actually requires that there be a Jewish representative in parliament. I described myself as Jewish on my latest visit without experiencing any anti-Semitism; I also visited a synagogue in Tehran and asked members if they had any concerns or problems living in Iran; the response I received was adamant, “Not at all.”Finally, to the people in U.S. Homeland Security who wondered if I went to Iran to become “radicalized”: After years of government-forced religiosity, Iran is one of the least religious countries in the Middle East with a less than 2 percent Friday prayer attendance rate.None of this is intended to excuse or defend the atrocious human rights record of the current Iranian government, its jailing of dual-nationals, its support of Hezbollah, its lack of transparency, or any of the other serious concerns that the U.S. has with Iran. The government is not one that we should be eager to work with; however, ultimately the young, secular, Western-loving, modern population of this country ― over 70 percent of who were born *after* the 1979 revolution – will inherit the country from the aging hardliners. Let’s not squander the opportunity for future reconciliation with the newer generation by viewing the entire country through the lens of decades old resentments and misconceptions. The notion that Iran is our irreconcilable enemy is simply untrue."

This is a very real concern; but unfortunately, the conversation about gentrification and displacement tends to be reductive and does little to enhance the public discourse. In light of the severity of our housing crisis, “gentrification” has taken on an entirely negative connotation and efforts to improve neighborhoods— whether by the city or private sector—are maligned, and the person, vilified. This isn’t helping anyone.At L+M, we believe that a safe, convenient, and vibrant neighborhood is a right, not a luxury reserved for the super-wealthy. Our approach to development is holistic: we seek out projects that will create new jobs, provide better options for residents, and reactivate streets, sidewalks and open space. Our goal is to help neighborhoods thrive and ensure all residents— regardless of income— can access good schools, adequate health care, and essential services, like daycare and grocery stores.In the Bronx— which has the dubious distinction of being the least healthy county in the state— we’ve partnered with St. Barnabas Hospital and BronxWorks to build more than 300 high-quality, affordable homes while seeking to reduce avoidable emergency room visits through a suite of preventative health services for residents and the community. On the ground floor of the new building, we are providing St. Barnabas Hospital with a new, 50,000 square-foot medical and wellness center, which will offer comprehensive programs on smoking prevention, fitness, nutrition, stress reduction and life skills. Thirty percent of the new apartments will be reserved for homeless individuals and families, and support services—such as mental health and addiction counseling—will be available to all those who need it. Other health-related components of the project include a rooftop farm, healthy food café, weekly farmers market, teaching kitchen, and fitness center with outdoor space for yoga, meditation and Tai Chi.Our project with St. Barnabas, and other likes it, are emblematic of our belief in cultivating a community in an intentional and thoughtful way and providing resources in neighborhoods where they are needed most.Most people can agree that the severe shortage of affordable housing in our city requires a real, productive discussion and debate, including in the media. We cannot, and should not, ignore the complexities of the housing crisis— including the how’s, when’s and why’s of gentrification—but splitting real estate developers and communities into two opposing camps discourages real communication and distracts from important social issues and community needs.What we need is an open dialogue, open-minded attitudes, and trust on all sides. And everyone at the table—the city, developers, activists, nonprofits, and New Yorkers at large—need to start asking the tough questions, like how do we grow our city while keeping our neighborhoods intact? ​Where can we create​ ​opportunities for affordable homeownership? ​Can we do more to preserve our existing affordable housing stock?New York City will never stop being a place where people want to live and more development is necessary to accommodate new residents and provide better housing for those who already live here. And while it’s true that we face a number of significant obstacles— uneven access to opportunity and economic disparity being two of the most persistent— when I consider just how community-oriented New York City is, and how resilient, I cannot help but be optimistic about the future. We have a lot of work ahead, but having a real conversation about gentrification is a necessary first step.“A Conversation on Gentrification” originally was published on RonMoelis.com."

On the ground floor of the new building, we are providing St. Barnabas Hospital with a new, 50,000 square-foot medical and wellness center, which will offer comprehensive programs on smoking prevention, fitness, nutrition, stress reduction and life skills. Thirty percent of the new apartments will be reserved for homeless individuals and families, and support services—such as mental health and addiction counseling—will be available to all those who need it. Other health-related components of the project include a rooftop farm, healthy food café, weekly farmers market, teaching kitchen, and fitness center with outdoor space for yoga, meditation and Tai Chi.Our project with St. Barnabas, and other likes it, are emblematic of our belief in cultivating a community in an intentional and thoughtful way and providing resources in neighborhoods where they are needed most.Most people can agree that the severe shortage of affordable housing in our city requires a real, productive discussion and debate, including in the media. We cannot, and should not, ignore the complexities of the housing crisis— including the how’s, when’s and why’s of gentrification—but splitting real estate developers and communities into two opposing camps discourages real communication and distracts from important social issues and community needs.What we need is an open dialogue, open-minded attitudes, and trust on all sides. And everyone at the table—the city, developers, activists, nonprofits, and New Yorkers at large—need to start asking the tough questions, like how do we grow our city while keeping our neighborhoods intact? ​Where can we create​ ​opportunities for affordable homeownership? ​Can we do more to preserve our existing affordable housing stock?New York City will never stop being a place where people want to live and more development is necessary to accommodate new residents and provide better housing for those who already live here. And while it’s true that we face a number of significant obstacles— uneven access to opportunity and economic disparity being two of the most persistent— when I consider just how community-oriented New York City is, and how resilient, I cannot help but be optimistic about the future. We have a lot of work ahead, but having a real conversation about gentrification is a necessary first step.“A Conversation on Gentrification” originally was published on RonMoelis.com."

The move, announced Tuesday by a state Health and Human Services official, will affect about 11,000 Texans who rely on the government’s health care service for low-income Americans, The New York Times reported. Planned Parenthood is set to lose about $4 million in annual funding when the Texas termination takes effect.“Texans expect that when taxpayer dollars are granted to health care providers, it is only to those who demonstrate that the health and safety of their patients come before a profit motive that puts women at greater risk,” Gov. Greg Abbott (R) said in a statement Tuesday.Planned Parenthood has 15 days to file an administrative appeal. The group said it would seek to block the state’s move in court, according to The Texas Tribune.The notice is the final step in an 18-month legal battle between Planned Parenthood and the state government. The Texas Health and Human Services Commission said in October it planned to end Planned Parenthood’s Medicaid contract after a series of doctored sting videos were released by an anti-abortion group that purported to show Planned Parenthood officials discussing the sale of fetal tissue.Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit at the time seeking an injunction to block the threatened state action. This year, a grand jury found no evidence of wrongdoing by Planned Parenthood employees and instead indicted the anti-abortion activists who made the videos (the charges were later dismissed).Cecile Richards, the president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, on Wednesday condemned the Texas move on Medicaid funding, calling it a precedent that could lead to “nothing less than a national health care disaster” on Twitter.The group said it will continue to provide health care services in Texas. Most Planned Parenthood clinics in the state don’t provide abortion services, NPR reported.The group has seen an unprecedented surge in donations following the election of Donald Trump and Mike Pence, who have both promised to dramatically roll back access to abortion. Planned Parenthood said this month it has received more than 82,000 donations in the name of Pence this year."
31,POLITICS,Inaugurations Are Ethically Problematic. Trump Is Just Taking It Much Further.,Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-inauguration_us_585ab3f8e4b0eb586484c84f,"For $250,000, you can have an ""intimate policy discussion"" with a cabinet appointee.",2016-12-21,President-elect Donald Trump is pushing the ethical envelop when it comes to his inauguration.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585ab5081800002c00e43e7d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In a frantic bit of cleanup on Tuesday, Donald Trump’s transition team downplayed what appeared to be a pay-for-play scheme surrounding the upcoming inauguration. A spokesperson for the president-elect said that, contrary to reports, Trump’s two eldest sons were not offering access to their father during next month’s inauguration weekend in exchange for $1 million donations to conservation charities. The foundation that had cooked up the scheme (which included hunting and fishing expeditions) was just floating an “initial” concept of an idea, the spokesperson said. Beyond that, neither Eric Trump nor Donald Trump Jr. were “involved in any capacity,” nor was the president-elect “aware of the event or the details pertaining to it.’’Nevertheless, the episode still rubbed government ethicists the wrong way, and not just because Eric Trump remained on the board of directors of the charity behind the proposal. For these ethicists, the concern is that the Jan. 20 Trump inauguration writ large has become a vehicle for those willing to pay the right price to gain access to the top echelons of the incoming administration.Even as the conservation charity idea appeared to crash before takeoff, the official inaugural committee was offering an underwriter benefits package that allowed well-heeled donors an audience with the president and his team. For $1 million, for example, a donor received benefits including access to an “exclusive event” with Cabinet appointees and House and Senate leadership, along with an “intimate dinner” with Vice-President-elect Mike Pence. Even those just willing to dole out $250,000, the gift was “an intimate policy discussion and dinner with select Cabinet appointees” among other goodies, including an opportunity to meet “the ladies of the first families” and “an elegant dinner in Washington, D.C., with special appearances” by the Trumps and Pences. Richard Painter, the chief White House ethics lawyer from 2005 to 2007, called the Trump inauguration benefits package an example of “paying for access.” So too does his colleague at the organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, Norman Eisen, who served as Chief Ethics Counsel for President Barack Obama. “But this is not just a Trump problem, this is the problem of big money in politics,” Eisen said. “Both parties raise big money around the Inauguration― and around everything else as well. The system has run amok.”A spokesperson for the Trump inauguration committee defended the benefits packages as a chance for the president-elect to thank those who ponied up the $65 million to $75 million they are aiming to raise to run an inauguration. Far from settings ripe for influence-peddling, they represented “a chance to thank our underwriters, whose generosity is helping bring the inauguration to life for all Americans, while honoring the diverse and qualified leaders the president-elect has appointed to various positions within government,” the spokesperson said. Still, it appears that the Trump team is pushing the ethical envelop more than its immediate predecessor. In 2008, Obama’s inaugural committee unilaterally restricted individual contributions to $50,000 and prohibited corporations from giving. Four years later, the president’s team loosened the restrictions ― wary that they would have trouble raising the cash needed to host an inauguration. Corporations gave. And individuals wrote checks far exceeding $50,000. But the benefits they received for those checks fell short of the elegant “candlelight dinners” that Trump is now offering. A fundraising appeal obtained by The Associated Press noted that premium donors ($250,000 for individuals and $1 million for corporations) got four tickets to the inaugural ball, seats in the bleacher for the parade, tickets to a children’s concert and a meeting with the president’s finance team to discuss “the road ahead.” “We did not do anything that was ‘come meet policy leaders’ as a quid pro quo for giving the inauguration committees,” said an official who worked on the 2013 inauguration but was not authorized by his current employer to discuss the matter. “If anything we tried to keep those two streams as clean as possible.”“The thing you need to realize is that the main check you have on what you can take is really perception,” the official added. “There are no rules for inaugurations. It is the wild west in terms of fundraising. It is about what signal you want to send out as you put together the first major public event of your presidency. But it is a hard line to walk because you also have to raise a lot of money very fast.”In going further than Obama in trying to lure donors to his inauguration, Trump risks eroding his promise to “drain the swamp” once in power. That being said, his own allies have begun admitting that “drain the swamp” was more a slogan than an actual ethos. “I’m told he now just disclaims that. He now says it was cute, but he doesn’t want to use it anymore,” former Speaker Newt Gingrich said of the rally cry. “I’ve noticed on a couple of fronts, like people chanting ‘lock her up,’ that he’s in a different role now and maybe he feels that as president, as the next president of the United States, that he should be marginally more dignified than talking about alligators in swamps.”Beyond the sense that Trump isn’t all that invested in government ethics, watchdogs are also concerned about the sheer number of possibilities for the incoming president to blur ethical lines. On the underwriter benefits document, for example, the Inaugural Committee says that those buying packages would receive “priority booking” at “premier” or “select” inaugural “hotel(s).” Which hotel these donors will get is left unmentioned, but it raised the possibility that some of the funding meant for the inauguration could end up going toward booking rooms in the Trump International Hotel Washington, D.C. A spokesperson didn’t return a request for clarification. But the larger point wasn’t lost on Eisen. “Trump is exacerbating the problem with his refusal to address his conflicts or even release his taxes so we know what the conflicts are,” he said in an email. “That sends a message of anything goes in the dark which seems to be making things worse.”Want more updates from Sam Stein?

Previous research suggests that poor and uninsured patients sometimes travel longer distances in an emergency to avoid for-profit hospitals closer to home out of concern about the bills. Instead, they would seek treatment at nonprofit facilities that might offer free or discounted care, said senior study author John Graves of Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tennessee.“By focusing in particular on ‘non-discretionary’ conditions such as poisoning, femur fractures, etc. – that is, conditions for which the individual would very likely have been treated in an ED regardless of insurance status – we show that ED visits for these services increased at our study sample hospitals, which were drawn from private, for-profit hospital chains,” Graves said by email.“This finding, coupled with our finding that Medicaid patients in expansion states traveled shorter distances, is evidence that people shifted where they sought ED care when they needed it,” Graves added. For the current study, researchers examined data on more than 1 million emergency department visits for adults aged 18 to 64 on Medicaid in 2013 and 2014 at 126 investor-owned hospital emergency departments.They used zip codes for the hospitals and patients’ homes to estimate average travel times and examined conditions that needed immediate treatment – the so-called non-discretionary care – as well as less critical issues that might be handled in an urgent care clinic or by a primary care provider.Before 2014, the hospitals in the study had similar proportions of uninsured patients. By the end of that year, the proportion of uninsured patients seen by EDs in expansion states dropped 47 percent, researchers report in the Annals of Internal Medicine.At the same time, the number of Medicaid visits in expansion states increased 126 percent by the end of 2014, compared with an 11 percent increase in states that didn’t expand coverage.For non-discretionary care in particular, the number of ED visits by uninsured patients dropped 42 percent in expansion states while Medicaid visits increased by 213 percent, the study found. Average travel time from home to the hospital decreased by 6.2 percent among Medicaid patients in expansion states, while it remained unchanged in other states.One limitation of the study is that it only looked at for-profit, investor-owned hospitals, which makes it hard to say how coverage changes may have played out at nonprofit or public hospitals, the authors note.It’s also possible that the lower travel times for expansion states were mostly reduced by previously uninsured patients in cities who gained coverage that let them seek care closer to home, rather than truly statewide reductions, said Dr. Mahshid Abir, a health policy researcher at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor who wasn’t involved in the study. The study also didn’t touch on another key issue related to time – how long people wait for care once they get to the hospital, Abir added by email.Still, the reduced travel times may translate into better outcomes for patients, said Brendan Saloner, a public health researcher at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore who wasn’t involved in the study.“This is good news for patients when one considers that people who are uninsured often are required to go to a far away emergency room that will provide them with reduced cost care,” Saloner said by email. “Alleviating this burden is a big deal, because minutes cut down traveling to the hospital can literally make the difference for whether a patient lives or dies.”SOURCE: bit.ly/2h6qdwN Annals of Internal Medicine, online December 19, 2016."

(REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585af0731800002c00e43fb6.jpeg?cache=0PBqB1pen4&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Joseph Menn(Reuters) - Yahoo Inc’s secret scanning of customer emails at the behest of a U.S. spy agency is part of a growing push by officials to loosen constitutional protections Americans have against arbitrary governmental searches, according to legal documents and people briefed on closed court hearings.The order on Yahoo from the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) last year resulted from the government’s drive to change decades of interpretation of the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment right of people to be secure against “unreasonable searches and seizures,” intelligence officials and others familiar with the strategy told Reuters.The unifying idea, they said, is to move the focus of U.S. courts away from what makes something a distinct search and toward what is “reasonable” overall.The basis of the argument for change is that people are making much more digital data available about themselves to businesses, and that data can contain clues that would lead to authorities disrupting attacks in the United States or on U.S. interests abroad.While it might technically count as a search if an automated program trawls through all the data, the thinking goes, there is no unreasonable harm unless a human being looks at the result of that search and orders more intrusive measures or an arrest, which even then could be reasonable.Civil liberties groups and some other legal experts said the attempt to expand the ability of law enforcement agencies and intelligence services to sift through vast amounts of online data, in some cases without a court order, was in conflict with the Fourth Amendment because many innocent messages are included in the initial sweep.“A lot of it is unrecognizable from a Fourth Amendment perspective,” said Orin Kerr, a former federal prosecutor and Georgetown University Law School expert on surveillance. “It’s not where the traditional Fourth Amendment law is.”But the general counsel of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), Robert Litt, said in an interview with Reuters on Tuesday that the legal interpretation needed to be adjusted because of technological changes.“Computerized scanning of communications in the same way that your email service provider scans looking for viruses - that should not be considered a search requiring a warrant for Fourth Amendment purposes,” said Litt. He said he is leaving his post on Dec. 31 as the end of President Barack Obama’s administration nears.DIGITAL SIGNATUREReuters was unable to determine what data, if any, was handed over by Yahoo after its live email search. The search was first reported by Reuters on Oct. 4. Yahoo and the National Security Agency (NSA) declined to explain the basis for the order.The surveillance court, whose members are appointed by U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, oversees and approves the domestic pursuit of intelligence about foreign powers. While details of the Yahoo search are classified, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters it was aimed at isolating a digital signature for a single person or small team working for a foreign government frequently at odds with America.The ODNI is expected to disclose as soon as next month an estimated number of Americans whose electronic communications have been caught up in online surveillance programs intended for foreigners, U.S. lawmakers said.The ODNI’s expected disclosure is unlikely to cover such orders as the one to Yahoo but would encompass those under a different surveillance authority called section 702. That section allows the operation of two internet search programs, Prism and “upstream” collection, that were revealed by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden more than three years ago. Prism gathers the messaging data of targets from Alphabet Inc’s Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple among others.Upstream surveillance allows the NSA to copy web traffic to search data for certain terms called “selectors,” such as email addresses, that are contained in the body of messages. ODNI’s Litt said ordinary words are not used as selectors.The Fourth Amendment applies to the search and seizure of electronic devices as much as ordinary papers. Wiretaps and other surveillance in the internet age are now subject to litigation across the United States. But in the FISC, with rare exceptions, the judges hear only from the executive branch.Their rulings have been appealed only three times, each time going to a review board. Only the government is permitted to appeal from there, and so far it has never felt the need.PUBLIC LEGAL CHALLENGESThe FISC’s reasoning, though, is heading into public courts. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Dec. 5 cited FISC precedents in rejecting an appeal of an Oregon man who was convicted of plotting to bomb a Christmas tree lighting ceremony after his emails were collected in another investigation.Groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union and the Electronic Frontier Foundation are fighting the expansion of legalized surveillance in Congress and in courts.On Dec. 8, the ACLU argued in the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that a lawsuit by Wikipedia’s parent group against the NSA should not have been dismissed by a lower court, which ruled that the nonprofit could not show it had been snooped on and that the government could keep details of the program secret.The concerns of civil libertarians and others have been heightened by President-elect Donald Trump’s nomination of conservative Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas to be director of the CIA. Pompeo, writing in the Wall Street Journal in January, advocated expanding bulk collection of telephone calling records in pursuit of Islamic State and its sympathizers who could plan attacks on Americans. Pompeo said the records could be combined with “publicly available financial and lifestyle information into a comprehensive, searchable database.”Yahoo’s search went far beyond what would be required to monitor a single email account. The company agreed to create and then conceal a special program on its email servers that would check all correspondence for a specific string of bits.Trawling for selectors is known as “about” searching, when content is collected because it is about something of interest rather than because it was sent or received by an established target. It is frequently used by the NSA in its bulk upstream collection of international telecom traffic.The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, an appointed panel established by Congress as part of its post-9/11 expansion of intelligence authority, reported in 2014 that “about” searches “push the program close to the line of constitutional reasonableness.”A glimpse of the new legal arguments came in a FISC proceeding last year held to review NSA and FBI annual surveillance targets and four sets of procedures for limiting the spread of information about Americans.Judge Thomas Hogan appointed Amy Jeffress, an attorney at Arnold and Porter and a former national security prosecutor, to weigh in, the first time that court had asked an outside privacy expert for advice before making a decision.Jeffress argued each search aimed at an American should be tested against the Fourth Amendment, while prosecutors said that only overall searching practice had to be evaluated for “reasonableness.” Hogan agreed with the government, ruling that even though the Fourth Amendment was all but waived in the initial data gathering because foreigners were the targets, the voluminous data incidentally gathered on Americans could also be used to investigate drug deals or robberies.“While they are targeting foreign intelligence information, they are collecting broader information, and there needs to be strong protections for how that information is used apart from national security,” Jeffress told Reuters.ODNI’s Litt wrote in a February Yale Law Review article that the new approach was appropriate, in part because so much personal data is willingly shared by consumers with technology companies. Litt advocated for courts to evaluate “reasonableness” by looking at the entirety of the government’s activity, including the degree of transparency.Litt told Reuters that he did not mean, however, that the same techniques in “about” searches should be pushed toward the more targeted searches at email providers such as Yahoo.Although speaking generally, he said: “My own personal approach to this is you should trade off broader collection authority for stricter use authority,” so that more is taken in but less is acted upon.This position strikes some academics and participants in the process as a remarkable departure from what the highest legal authority in the land was thinking just two years ago.That was when the Supreme Court’s Roberts wrote for a majority in declaring that mobile phones usually could not be searched without warrants.After prosecutors said they had protocols in place to protect phone privacy, Roberts wrote: “Probably a good idea, but the Founders did not fight a revolution to gain the right to government agency protocols.”With little evidence that the Supreme Court agrees with the surveillance court, it remains possible it would reverse the trend. But a case would first need to make its way up there.(Reporting by Joseph Menn in San Francisco; additional reporting by Dustin Volz, Mark Hosenball and John Walcott in Washington; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Grant McCool)"

Earlier this month, the transition team sent the Department of Energy a questionnaire asking for a list of all employees and contractors who worked on initiatives related to climate change and attended United Nations meetings to tackle the issue. The agency refused to comply, citing concerns over employee privacy, and some compared the request to McCarthy-era witch hunts.The Trump team disavowed the questionnaire after it drew heavy criticism, saying it was “not authorized” and the person on the transition team who sent it was “properly counseled.”But the latest inquiry to the State Department draws heavy parallels to that incident and reflects Trump’s ongoing hostility toward environmental protection and the threat of climate change, which he has called a “hoax” manufactured by the Chinese.Almost every member of the president-elect’s future cabinet has expressed disbelief over the man-made phenomenon, and some have alleged the government will soon be “of, by and for the oil and gas industry.” Trump himself has said he’ll withdraw the U.S. from the landmark Paris climate agreement, repeal President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan and open up domestic production of fossil fuels, effectively ending any environmental progress made over the past eight years.The Post notes it’s unclear how much money the State Department spends each year on climate change and environmental initiatives, but cited a federal report that found the government as a whole spent $77 billion between 2008 and 2013 on such projects. Most of that money went toward clean energy projects at the Energy Department, however.Scientists, at risk of losing most of the federal funding for their work, have been panicking ahead of the inauguration next month. Some have begun frantically copying research from the past decade, fearing it could be deleted by incoming officials. Others have sent a series of strongly worded letters to the president-elect urging him to leave funding alone.“The consequences are real: without this investment, children will be more vulnerable to lead poisoning, more people will be exposed to unsafe drugs and medical devices, and we will be less prepared to limit the impacts of increasing extreme weather and rising seas,” a group of 2,300 leading scientists, including 22 Nobel Prize recipients, said in an open letter to Trump last month."

He was a musical prodigy, reportedly teaching himself to play the piano, drums and harmonica by age 10. A year later, Motown founder Berry Gordy offered him a record deal, and in 1963, “Little” Stevie Wonder landed his first of many No. 1 hits with the spirited live recording “Fingertips, Pt. 2.”He was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in the 1980s, was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2014, and has won more than 20 Grammys. “Naming this street in his honor is reflective of the profound impact that he has had on both the city of Detroit and Motown’s legacy,” Robin Terry, Motown Museum chairwoman and CEO, said in a statement ahead of the dedication. It’s not the only new honor bestowed on Wonder.

Wonder took up the cause of championing social justice issues through his music.He then took a moment during the celebratory press conference to get “real,” urging fans to focus on unifying the nation in the wake of divisions revealed by the presidential election.“I’ve never seen none of you,” Wonder said, referencing his lifelong blindness, “so when I hear things about people not liking people because of the color of their skin, it is so absurd to me, so barbaric to me.“I just say to you in this city, even in this state that has now become, at this point, a red state ― I’m just keeping it real ― don’t let the color of the state define who you are,” he added. “Don’t let negativity say this is what you are.”Before the election, Wonder quipped that voting for President-elect Donald Trump would be like asking the blind musician to drive you to the hospital in an emergency.“We are on a journey,” he said Wednesday. “When I think about this street, now being Stevie Wonder Avenue, I want all of us to walk down the street that leads us to a place of humanity and equality, of fairness and respect for each other.”Wonder, 66, was born Stevland Hardaway Judkins in Saginaw, Michigan, and spent his childhood in Detroit. He was a musical prodigy, reportedly teaching himself to play the piano, drums and harmonica by age 10. A year later, Motown founder Berry Gordy offered him a record deal, and in 1963, “Little” Stevie Wonder landed his first of many No. 1 hits with the spirited live recording “Fingertips, Pt. 2.”He was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in the 1980s, was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2014, and has won more than 20 Grammys. “Naming this street in his honor is reflective of the profound impact that he has had on both the city of Detroit and Motown’s legacy,” Robin Terry, Motown Museum chairwoman and CEO, said in a statement ahead of the dedication. It’s not the only new honor bestowed on Wonder. News site Slate has declared this “Wonder Week,” delving into the artist’s discography and his enduring influence on popular culture.And if you read through Slate’s growing list of articles, you may as well listen to a seasonally appropriate soundtrack ― so here’s a compilation of Wonder’s Christmas songs.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585a9a1e1c00000a070ecce0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Wes Anderson officially announced the title for his upcoming stop-motion animation film: “Isle of Dogs.” On Tuesday, the director released a video announcement about the film on Vimeo, which features a special appearance by one of its stars, Edward Norton. Mumblings about the project began popping up last year, when Jeff Goldblum let slip that he’d be lending his voice to the film.Along with Norton and Goldblum, the movie boasts a massive cast including Scarlett Johansson, Bill Murray, Bryan Cranston, Frances McDormand, Greta Gerwig, Akira Ito, Akira Takayama and even Yoko Ono, among others.Filming for the project is currently underway in England, but to satisfy our curiosities, Anderson also released a tiny glimpse at Norton’s canine character, Rex. The best part, though, is that you have a chance to be in the film. Sure, it’s probably not a huge chance, but it’s technically possible. As part of his announcement, Anderson teamed up with Crowdwise to launch a contest that will award one lucky winner with a trip to London to tour the set and voice a character. There is one small catch, though. Entering the contest requires a $10 donation, with proceeds going to The Film Foundation, a non-profit founded by Martin Scorsese “dedicated to protecting and preserving motion picture history.”“Isle of Dogs” will be Anderson’s follow-up to 2014’s “The Grand Budapest Hotel” and will be his second foray into stop-motion animation after 2009’s “The Fantastic Mr. Fox.” As of now, there is no release date.

The Oscar, Emmy and Golden Globe-winning star will be honored with the Human Rights Campaign’s (HRC) Ally for Equality Award, in recognition of her longtime support of the LGBTQ community, in February. The actress, who was last seen on the big screen this summer in “Florence Foster Jenkins,” will be presented with the award at the 2017 HRC Greater New York Gala, slated for Feb. 11 at the Waldorf Astoria in New York.HRC President Chad Griffin praised Streep, 67, for standing up for the LGBTQ community “throughout her phenomenal career” in a blog post on his organization’s website. “Whether through her iconic roles that raised the visibility of LGBTQ people, or by boldly speaking out for equality, Meryl Streep embodies the very nature of what it means to be an ally to our community,” he said.In August, Streep opened up about her connection to the LGBTQ community in an interview with PrideSource. “I just can’t remember when [LGBTQ] people were not in my life,” she said. “I’ve grown up with gay people and been in love with gay people.”Streep is no stranger to playing LGBT characters, too. In 1979, she played a lesbian in Woody Allen’s “Manhattan,” and was bisexual and shared a smooch with Allison Janney in “The Hours.” Then, of course, there was her much buzzed-about onstage lip-lock with Sandra Bullock at the 2010 Critics’ Choice Awards. And who could forget about her fantastical love scene in “Angels in America,” in which an angel (played by Emma Thompson) brought her to orgasm while hovering over Manhattan? She’s also courted a sizable LGBTQ fanbase with quotable turns in “She-Devil,” “Death Becomes Her” and “The Devil Wears Prada.”For more information on the 2017 HRC Greater New York Gala, head here. "

And better yet, it tastes like a fresh-baked Christmas sugar cookie: As with many cult recipes, the Tom and Jerry’s origins are uncertain. According to The Atlantic, the most popular story holds that a British author invented the drink in the late 1800s as a marketing stunt for his book, whose main characters were Tom and Jerry.The drink gained a following in the U.S., where it’s best known in Minnesota and Wisconsin. Enjoyed mainly by generations past, the Tom and Jerry has made a small comeback in the last decade or so, popping up in trendy bars beyond its Midwestern base.The once-a-year kind of drink is labor intensive: Recipes vary, but they always start with a traditional “batter” of whipped egg whites folded in with a mixture of egg yolks and ingredients like spices, sugar, vanilla and/or rum. The New York Times’ recipe involves pouring a blend of rum, Cognac and hot milk over the batter, then dusting the top with nutmeg.Frothy and rich, the resulting drink “combines the childlike pleasure of a just-baked Christmas cookie with the distinctly adult perk of booze,” according to The Kitchn.We’re so onboard with that.

Bill Huizenga.",2016-12-21,Rep. Bill Huizenga says people should consider putting off a trip to the E.R. to save money.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585b054c1800002c00e44001.jpeg?ops=crop_471_30_3529_2437%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Mich.) says there’s “definitely” going to be changes in health care delivery after Republicans repeal the Affordable Care Act, and people are going to need to take more responsibility for the cost of their treatment.He gave a personal example of how do this: When his 10-year-old son recently fell on the driveway one evening and injured his arm, Huizenga waited until the next day to take him to the doctor because it cost less than bringing him to the emergency room that night.“We weren’t sure what was going on,” the GOP lawmaker said in a Monday interview with a local news outlet, MLive.com. “So I splinted it up, and we wrapped it up, and the decision was, okay, do we go to the E.R.? We thought it was a sprain, but weren’t sure. Took every precaution and decided to go in the next morning.”It turned out his son’s arm was broken.At a time when Republicans are broadcasting plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act next year, it’s an unsettling proposition that people with an undiagnosed and potentially serious ailment or broken body part should choose to get treated later, or less often, to save money.Huizenga said he “certainly” would have brought his son to the E.R. that night if he appeared seriously injured. But he’s not a doctor who can make a clear assessment. A broken bone not treated properly, for example, can fuse incorrectly and require a fresh break to heal properly. What appears to be a lingering cold may be pneumonia, which, left untreated, will make a person sicker and cost even more to remedy. Cancer not caught early is much more likely to be fatal.For all their complaints about Obama’s signature accomplishment, Republicans have yet to unveil a health care replacement for the Affordable Care Act despite vowing to do so for nearly six years. The program currently provides 20 million people with health insurance.The Michigan congressman’s comments are in line with a long-held, free-market view of the health care system. But a free market assumes actors are free to make choices. A sick or badly injured person is often not the best negotiator. And Huizenga’s child, of course, didn’t get to make his own choice.“At some point or another, we have to be responsible, or have part of the responsibility for what’s going on,” Huizenga said. “When it’s those types of things ― do you keep your child home from school and take them the next morning to the doctor because of a cold or a flu versus taking them into the emergency room ― if you don’t have any cost difference, you know, you’ll make different decisions.”A request for comment from Michigan Children’s Protective Services on the appropriateness of Huizenga’s decision was not returned.UPDATE: Dec. 22 ― Huizenga said Wednesday night that he used “a poor choice of words” to highlight his son’s broken arm as a political point.Ryan Grim contributed reporting."

But it also drew praise from another part of American society that is getting progressively louder about its place in politics ― the secular community. Thanks to advocacy work from secular activists, the updated law now includes language that explicitly calls for the protection of “non-theistic beliefs” and the “right not to profess or practice any religion.”American courts have formally recognized the rights of the religiously unaffiliated since at least the Vietnam War. But according to the American Humanist Association, the new bipartisan law was the first piece of legislation to ever use the term “non-theist.” Broadly speaking, a non-theist is anyone whose belief system doesn’t include the existence of a deity or deities. The term encompasses a wide range of identities, including atheists, humanists, and agnostics. “Having this term in legislation demonstrates that Congress and the President are recognizing the legitimacy of the secular community, which includes humanists, atheists, agnostics, and nonreligious individuals, and our growing numbers both within the United States and abroad,” Matthew Bulger, the American Humanist Association’s legislative director, told The Huffington Post.The new law is named after Frank R.

IFRA created the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, an independent, bipartisan commission that reviews religious freedom violations around the world and makes recommendations to the President, Secretary of State, and Congress. Along with the section about the rights of nontheists, the law also institutes mandatory religious freedom training for foreign service officers and makes it possible for the State Department to identify and recommend action against non-state groups who are violating religious freedoms, (such as ISIS or Boko Haram). Secular advocacy organizations have been concerned about reports of the persecution of nonbelievers in countries like Bangladesh, where an atheist law student was hacked to death earlier this year after criticizing Islam, and Saudi Arabia, where atheist blogger Raif Badawi was arrested in 2012 and punished with flogging and jail time. Atheist and other members of the secular community have been meeting with the State Department since 2012 to discuss these concerns, according to RNS.In addition to protecting the human rights of secular activists abroad, the AHA hopes that the Wolf Act will help boost protections for people at home.“We are also hopeful that by addressing the violent persecution that non-theists face abroad, the stigma faced by non-theists in the United States will also abate,” Bulger told HuffPost. Although the number of Americans who identify as atheists has increased in recent years, they are a minority (about 3.1 percent in 2014). According to the Pew Research Center, Americans harbor cold, negative feelings toward atheists, and half of American adults say they would be less likely to vote for a candidate who doesn’t believe in God. There are no professed atheists serving in Congress today. Phil Zuckerman, a professor of sociology and secular studies at Pitzer College, told The Huffington Post that several American states still have language in their constitutions that, while unenforceable today, make it illegal for an atheist to hold any public office. “So yes, it is great news that non-Theists are being specifically mentioned as people worthy of protection from government oppression and persecution,” Zuckerman told The Huffington Post. “It’s just another indication that secular people are not only growing in number, but also growing in acceptance and recognition.

The letters date from September 2011 to June 2013.Vattenfall, the Swedish company developing the 11-turbine farm, said in July it plans to move ahead with the $349 million project. “You seem hell bent on destroying Scotland’s coastlines and therefore, Scotland itself,” Trump wrote in a letter dated Feb. 9, 2012. “I will never be ‘on board,’ as you have stated I would be, with this insanity.”Trump insisted the turbines would damage the Scottish economy and ruin Salmond’s dream of gaining independence from the United Kingdom. Salmond resigned as top minister in September 2014 after a referendum in which voters narrowly agreed to remain unified with England, Wales and Northern Ireland. “The monstrous industrial machines that you want to litter all over the magnificent waters and shore of Scotland will destroy the environment and tourism sector,” Trump wrote in a March 12, 2012, letter. “Ireland is very happy! Do you want to be known for centuries to come as ‘Mad Alex ― the man who destroyed Scotland?’”A month later, Trump predicted the Scottish economy would “become a third world wasteland that global investors will avoid,” according a letter sent April 19, 2012. Roughly two weeks after that, Trump switched to a different tone. “I will be your greatest cheerleader if you change or modify your stance on at least the inappropriately placed turbines,” he wrote in a letter dated May 2, 2012.He sent his final letter in the series on June 5, 2013, enclosing a critical report on the planned turbines. Trump, who has called climate change “a hoax,” has repeatedly railed against the U.S. wind industry in the past year, claiming turbines have “killed so many eagles.” Last December, Britain’s top court threw out a lawsuit Trump filed to halt construction on the turbines. But Trump renewed the fight two weeks after winning the presidency by meeting with a group that could campaign on the issue. "

Now safely resettled in Germany, she said she feels farther than ever from home as she watches the Syrian regime and pro-government forces retake control of her city.“After this silence from all the world I don’t think there is any chance to return to my homeland,” she said last week in a video recording from Goslar, Germany, where she now lives. “So I will stay here without any address, without any history.”Kamil and her children, Hammoudi, Helen, Farah and Sara, are the subjects of “Watani,” an Oscar-nominated documentary filmed by German director Marcel Mettelsiefen over the course of three years. The title means “my homeland” in Arabic.Kamil and her family lived in Saif-al-Dawla, a middle-class neighborhood in eastern Aleppo. Her husband, Abu Ali Slaibeh, joined the Free Syrian Army, one of the largest rebel factions in control of the eastern part of Aleppo, after war broke out in Syria in 2011. In late 2013, he was captured by fighters from the militant group that calls itself the Islamic State.Kamil used to harbor dreams of returning to Syria after the war. But three years on, the fall of Aleppo and the major defeat for rebel factions have led her to believe her husband is gone for good, she said.“We lost hope,” she said last week. “I miss my family, I miss my home, I miss my garden. I want sometimes to be in my garden to drink coffee with my husband. But now, I lost this dream.”Mettelsiefen was by the family’s side before Slaibeh was captured ― they also featured in an earlier documentary of his, “Children of Syria.” He stuck with them during the moments when they decided to flee, and was there throughout their journey to Europe and even over the course of their transition in Germany. He traveled to Syria more than 25 times to film the family, he told The Huffington Post.Kamil made the decision to stay in Aleppo for a whole year after her husband’s capture “until she realized that she couldn’t stay, it was too dangerous,” Mettelsiefen said. “The children said, ‘We don’t want to leave, we want to stay with our father,’” he added. “Everybody was kind of bound to the father, to the country. But a lot of people I talked with said how selfish it is as parents to decide for their children to stay in such a place where they might get killed.”The family made it to Turkey at the end of 2014, where they applied for asylum in Germany from a refugee camp. They were part of a lucky group to have their claims granted, before the swell of migrants and refugees began making their way into the country daily. Germany took in a record 1 million people in 2015.The film shows how each family member tries to cope with the resettlement process. Kamil’s three daughters adjust to life in Germany relatively quickly. They pick up German and make friends. Thirteen-year-old Helen, the eldest girl, even stops wearing her hijab, despite her fear that her mother will judge her.Hammoudi, Kamil’s 15-year-old son, hangs on to his heritage a little more tightly, reading the Quran at night and promising to enroll at the local mosque.“I think we should have stayed in our country,” he says at one point. He talks about viewing Germany as a stepping stone, a means to an end. He looks forward to the day when he can return to Syria.Kamil, meanwhile, still lives in a state of limbo without any news of her husband. “I’m now dead,” she says in the film. “I’ve been dead for two years, but anything new must be built on ruins, and on people you’ve lost in the past. I let something very big inside me die.”Kamil’s children understand their mother is in pain. Mettelsiefen juxtaposes shots of the kids socializing at school with solitary shots of their mother, standing at the window and suffering in silence.“You can see it on her face that she’s not happy,” Sara, 7, said.The trials and tribulations of Kamil’s family are intended to illustrate the larger refugee experience in Germany, Mettelsiefen said.“Once people arrive in Germany, everybody is going through the same thing,” he said. “They never ever wanted to come in the first place. They were forced to leave.”There is a silver lining. Kamil’s family no longer lives in fear of airstrikes and shelling. And Goslar, the central German town where they’ve resettled, is particularly eager to welcome refugees. Kamil and her children could be considered some of the lucky ones, Mettelsiefen said, compared to the hundreds of thousands who had to make the journey to Europe on packed boats across the Mediterranean ― and the thousands who did not survive the crossing. In Kamil’s case, the German government offered her and her children plane tickets, a new house and a monthly stipend as part of their asylum package.But none of that has caused Kamil to forget the life she left behind, Mettelsiefen added.“The pain is still there,” he said.

47,POLITICS,Donald Trump's Adviser From Goldman May Be His Most Environmentally Friendly Pick Yet,Ben Walsh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-gary-cohn-goldman-sachs_us_585aade9e4b0de3a08f3b7b7,"The bank accepts climate science and called for a ""strong"" climate treaty.",2016-12-21,Former Goldman Sachs Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn talks on the phone as he waits to have a meeting with President-elect Donald Trump at Trump Tower. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585aae731800002d00e43e52.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President-elect Donald Trump is creating what’s expected to be an anti-environment administration, full of oil executives and climate change deniers. But at least one appointee doesn’t fit that mold: Gary Cohn, the incoming director of the National Economic Council.The 26-year Goldman Sachs veteran brings with him the investment bank’s longstanding acknowledgement of climate change, which Trump has referred to as a Chinese hoax, and support for the international agreement to address it, which Trump has said he’ll abandon.Goldman Sachs wrote its first companywide environmental policy in 2005, the year before Cohn took over as president and chief operating officer. In it, the bank said climate change “is a reality and that human activities are largely responsible for increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the earth’s atmosphere.” The bank kept that line when it updated its policy last year.And three months before negotiations began for the Paris climate accord in 2015, Goldman joined companies like Apple, Google, General Motors and Walmart to write a letter to the White House and call for a “strong” climate deal. The organizations also pledged to deepen their own commitment to clean energy. And several banks, including Goldman, released a joint statement at the time, asking governments to strike a “strong global climate agreement” and stating that a price on carbon is a critically important government policy for fighting climate change. Goldman followed that statement with a pledge to invest and loan $150 billion in clean energy over the next decade.Goldman Sachs declined to comment on Cohn’s appointment, and the Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.To be clear, Goldman’s climate position simply reflects the global scientific consensus, at least outside of the Trump team. It’s also not altruistic. As Goldman executives and critics alike will readily admit, the firm exists to make money. When writer Matt Taibbi famously called the bank “a great vampire squid” in the wake of the 2008 mortgage crisis and financial meltdown, he said the institution’s next target for its “blood funnel” was a cap-and-trade policy to limit carbon emissions ― which would create a new trading market in which the bank could try to turn a profit. (Legislation creating such a system passed the House but never made it through the Senate.) A recurring theme in Goldman Sachs’ climate statements is that government action on climate ― passing laws, setting regulations, signing treaties ― will send signals to the market and point investments in the right direction. This is generally true of almost any large-scale, functioning market, and it is particularly true for clean energy ― where trillions of dollars in investment and infrastructure are needed globally over several decades to retrofit entire industries. Still, it’s jarring to hear financiers step down from the free-market pedestals they’ve created to say that they do, in fact, rely on the government to do their work. During the Obama administration, markets have largely gotten the certainty they’ve asked for on pricing carbon: There is now an international climate treaty, as well as new domestic regulations on automobile and power plants emissions. The federal government also uses a price for carbon in its internal analysis of rule-makings ― known as the social cost of carbon. That puts Cohn in a unique position. He will join an administration that has largely denied that climate change is real. And while he won’t control the agencies that deal with the issue most directly, such as the Environmental Protection Agency or the Department of Energy, he will report directly to Trump and have the broad prerogative of advising the president’s economic policies.Financiers like Cohn asked the government to give them certainty on climate policy, and they largely got it. The question is whether Cohn will use his power to keep it.Disclosure: Ben Walsh worked at Goldman Sachs from 2006 to 2011, and was on the bank’s environmental team from 2009 to 2011. From 2008 to 2009, he worked with Gary Cohn’s chief of staff, among others. "

If it has one redeeming quality, however, that’d be the fact that it gave us some fantastic podcasts to listen to, whether we wanted to blissfully forget about the world or try to better understand it.“Radio on the internet” feels like it’s never been more popular ― and the numbers suggest that’s true.According to Apple, over 10 billion ― with a “B” ― podcast episodes were consumed on its devices in 2016. That’s 2 billion more downloads than 2015 and 3 billion more than 2014 on Apple devices alone. (The most popular podcast of the year? “Fresh Air” from NPR.) Why such a jump? We’re currently enjoying a “podcast moment,” according to HotPod newsletter author Nick Quah. Over the past three years, the medium has enjoyed a sneaking increase in popularity, their hosts even emerging from recording studios for appearances on late-night shows. Although they are still notably lacking a diverse range of voices, the number of podcasts ― from amateurs and professionals alike ― has crept up, although, according to the Pew Research Center, no widely accepted total estimate exists. Between December 2015 and December 2016, major media companies including The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal launched podcast divisions; others like WNYC, BuzzFeed and Gimlet put more funding behind new, high-quality shows.Look around, and you’ll see the fruits of their labor ― plenty of publications have been sharing their lists of Best Podcasts of 2016. (Here’s ours!) Advertisers have flocked to snag a piece of the podcast audience, dropping up to six figures on simple ads read by hosts, as in the old-timey days of radio.Ten billion, however, is only the number of episodes listened to via Apple’s Podcast app ― the one that comes pre-installed on iPhones and iPads. According to Quah, about 50 to 60 percent of podcast listeners use the iOS app.Accounting for all the podcast episodes heard through different apps such as Overcast, Castro and Stitcher, the total number of episodes we listened to in 2016 is likely much higher than 10 billion.May 2017 bring us even more listens.

49,POLITICS,North Carolina Fails To Repeal Anti-LGBTQ Bill,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/north-carolina-hb2-repeal_us_585a8f9be4b0d9a5945692e8,The entire effort disintegrated into a giant mess.,2016-12-21,North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R) called a special legislative session to take up the repeal of HB2.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585a901f1800002d00e43dbc.jpeg?cache=NujqWgcac9&ops=crop_6_197_2994_1677%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"What was supposed to be a smooth repeal of North Carolina’s anti-LGBTQ law fell apart Wednesday as Democrats said Republicans backed out on a deal to put forward a clean repeal bill. The General Assembly voted to adjourn its special session after more than nine hours with the law still on the books. HB2 barred cities and localities from enacting anti-discrimination policies that protect people on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity; it also prevented schools from allowing transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds with their gender identity rather than the gender assigned to them at birth. Republican Gov. Pat McCrory and Republican lawmakers pushed HB2 through the state legislature after Charlotte passed a nondiscrimination ordinance protecting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people. But there have been significant changes in the state since then. Businesses have pulled their jobs and events out of the state, McCrory lost his re-election to Democrat Roy Cooper and Republicans are sick of having to deal with the national uproar. On Monday, Charlotte’s city council also voted unanimously to rescind its nondiscrimination ordinance under the promise that the General Assembly would then move to repeal HB2. In response to Charlotte’s move, McCrory called the legislature back for a special session Wednesday.Democrats said Wednesday that they were expecting a clean repeal bill. But instead, Sen. Phil Berger, the GOP leader of the chamber, put forward a measure that would set a six-month “cooling-off” period during which time localities would be barred from making changes to their ordinances on issues of employment and public accommodations. In other words, HB2 would essentially be in effect for another six months. The measure could also have tied the hands of localities looking to change ordinances on issues like the minimum wage. “It’s something that helps us get to a reset so that to the extent you think we’ve done the right thing or the wrong thing, you think Charlotte has done the right thing or the wrong thing, it gives everyone an opportunity to start over,” Berger said on the Senate floor Wednesday afternoon. “You don’t get those chances very often.”He added that it would allow the General Assembly to work on a “long-range solution” to the issues, although it’s unclear what that would be. Democrats, however, came out against the GOP bill.State Sen. Floyd McKissick (D) took to the floor and said his fear was that the six-month period would continually be extended, meaning HB2 would essentially be left in place. Republicans similarly said they felt betrayed by Democrats. The Charlotte City Council didn’t repeal the entire ordinance Monday; it left in place a few provisions ― including one barring contractors from discriminating on the basis of gender identity. Republicans balked when they found out, and the council reconvened Wednesday, voting 7-2 to repeal the entire ordinance.Late Tuesday night, the North Carolina GOP put out a statement blasting Cooper and politicians in Charlotte for their move. And there were some Republicans who didn’t want to see any repeal at all; Republican legislators spent hours meeting behind closed doors to figure out how to move forward. North Carolina Lt. Gov. Dan Forest (R) put out a statement Wednesday saying he opposed repeal efforts ― despite the turmoil and economic hit the state has taken.“No economic, political or ideological pressure can convince me that what is wrong is right,” he said. “It will always be wrong for men to have access to women’s showers and bathrooms.”Late Wednesday evening, Berger divided his bill into two parts ― one for full repeal and one on the moratorium ― with votes on each. If either part failed, the entire repeal effort failed. The first part failed, meaning the repeal legislation was dead. The Senate then voted to join the House in adjourning.Berger blamed Cooper for the defeat.“Make no mistake: Roy Cooper and Senate Democrats killed the repeal of HB2, abandoning Roy Cooper’s commitment to avoid divisive social issues by shooting down a temporary cooling off period on ordinances like the one that got us into this mess last March,” he said in a statement Wednesday evening. “As promised, I called a Special Session to reconsider a manufactured political issue that strategically targeted the city of Charlotte and our state by well-funded left-wing interest groups. This was at least the third time that pressure from the left sabotaged bipartisan good faith agreements for political purposes,” McCrory added in his own statement.Cooper said he was deeply disappointed over the “breach of trust” with Republicans.Even with the repeal of HB2, North Carolina’s LGBTQ community would be left without protections. The state still has no protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. In a statement Monday, Cooper indicated that he would push for equality when he takes office as governor in the new year. Still, much of the reaction was negative this week to Charlotte agreeing to rescind its ordinance in a deal with the state legislature. Mayor Jennifer Roberts (D) defended the move, saying it “should in no way be viewed as a compromise of our principles or commitment to non-discrimination.”“They made a calculated guess about whether this was going to work,” said James Esseks, director of the ACLU’s LGBT and HIV Project. “And if it doesn’t work, I’m sure they’re going to have a lot of regrets, because they will have taken protections away from the citizens of Charlotte and gotten nothing in return. That is a sad day. It seems awful hard to do political business in North Carolina. That’s for sure.”The city of Charlotte issued a statement Wednesday night saying it had “acted in good faith” to facilitate the repeal of HB2 and remained committed to “maintaining and protecting diverse and inclusive communities.”The ACLU, along with Lambda Legal, is also challenging the constitutionality of HB2 in court, with a ruling expected from a federal appeals court next year.“So this law, I think, is going to go away one way or another,” Esseks said. “It would be much better if the legislature simply got rid of it now so people don’t have to wait any longer for justice.”Businesses and corporations, which often go further than governments in their pro-LGBTQ policies, have been very critical of HB2 and pushed North Carolina to repeal it. IBM tweeted its disappointment that the effort failed Wednesday night. In November, Cooper defeated McCrory, whose loss was attributed in large part to the heat he took over HB2. McCrory conceded on Dec. 5, after a month of wrangling and raising unproved theories about fraud and other problems.In response, the GOP-controlled legislature pushed through several bills to take away powers from the incoming Democratic governor. “We’re now in a place where state legislatures around the country are going to convene in January or early in the year,” Esseks said. “And some of those people are thinking about doing, in essence, copycat bills like HB2. I think the message to all of them is, ‘Really? Do you really want the kind of backlash that North Carolina has experienced?’ And I hope that their answer is no.”This piece has been updated with additional reactions to the repeal effort.Want more updates from Amanda Terkel?

Turning a buck on strained relationships will not contribute to the healing process,” FOP President Chuck Canterbury wrote to Walmart CEO C. Douglas McMillon.Canterbury told McMillon that he was “concerned” that selling the shirts would “damage your company’s good name” among FOP members, as well as among other “active and retired law enforcement officers.”Shortly afterward, Walmart issued a statement to The Washington Post announcing it was dropping the products because of “customer complaints.” It will continue to sell other products bearing the words “Black Lives Matter.”“Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise. After hearing concerns from customers, we are removing the specific item with the ‘bulletproof’ reference,” said the statement.The “Bulletproof” shirts were being sold through the Walmart website by third-party vendor Old Glory Merchandise, which was not immediately available for comment.On Wednesday, Canterbury sent a similar letter to Amazon and its CEO, Jeffrey Bezos ― who also owns The Washington Post.“Because I believe you share the FOP’s goal of increasing the bonds of trust between the men and women of law enforcement and the communities they serve, I wanted to let you know that my members are very upset that you and Amazon are complicit in the sale of this very offensive merchandise,” Canterbury wrote to Bezos.Black Lives Matter merchandise on Amazon’s site comes from several different third-party sellers. Shirts saying “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot” were still available on the site Wednesday. “Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter” shirts were not for sale.Amazon was not immediately available for comment.The Fraternal Order of Police has clashed frequently with the Black Lives Matter movement, which was born when Trayvon Martin’s killer was acquitted in 2013 and has been fueled by the deaths of other black men at the hands of police. The FOP has claimed that the movement is anti-police and places officers’ lives in danger. Last year it began to push for classifying attacks on police officers as hate crimes."

Trump's Cabinet appointments are brazenly turning the U.S. into a kleptocracy – a land where those who have gained unprecedented wealth and power by cynically manipulating the rules now get to rewrite the rules for their own exclusive benefit. With all branches of government – executive, Congress, and the Supreme Court – in the hands of a morally bankrupt Republican leadership, the most powerful military and surveillance state in history is becoming a vehicle for corporations to ransack what's left of the natural world for their short-term gain. With free speech under attack, along with threats of a Muslim registry and mass deportations of undocumented workers, we appear to be plunging rapidly into a bottomless abyss.It's natural for anyone who cares about dignity, justice, and the welfare of future generations to feel some despair. But in the very darkness of the times ahead, there is reason for hope that this bleak period will be the harbinger of a transformed society: a new economic and social order based on principles of equity, compassion, and natural flourishing. How can that be?How change happens in complex systemsThe source of this hope emerges from research in complex systems – and more specifically, how phase transitions occur in these systems. Complex systems exist everywhere in the natural world: in weather patterns, lakes, and forest ecologies. They exist within humans – think immune, cardiovascular, and neurological systems – and they exist in the systems we humans create: in markets, and in social and political systems.These systems are nonlinear, which means the relationship between an input and output can vary wildly, and this characteristic makes them very difficult to predict. However, leading complexity scientists have studied how change happens in these systems, and have discovered principles that seem to occur universally. They are as true for a lake ecology as they are for a stock market. And they are equally applicable to our political system.A crucial principle is that, while a complex system can remain resilient within a set of parameters for a long time, occasionally it becomes so unstable that it experiences a tipping point: a dramatic shift that transforms the system into something very different. A forest, for example, can get thinned out until it can no longer sustain itself, and it turns into scrubland. A real estate market gets overheated until it suddenly collapses. A person's neurological firing can destabilize and suddenly puts them into an epileptic seizure.These shifts – known as phase transitions – can also herald beneficial changes. A chrysalis transforms into a butterfly. A fetus develops until it undergoes the phase transition known as birth. Same sex marriage can remain unthinkable for generations, until it becomes the widely accepted law of the land within a few years.Scientists have studied intensively how to predict when these phase transitions might occur, and have identified a few flags that indicate when we might expect one. An important indicator is an increase in the variance of fluctuations within the system. A stock market, for example, might start gyrating giddily before it finally crashes. Rainfall patterns may fluctuate wildly before a long-term drought sets in.Tipping points in historyWhen we apply these findings to history, it's easy to see these turbulent fluctuations preceding phase transitions – in retrospect. The Great Depression in the 1930s led to the rise of fascism. The global devastation of the Second World War cleared the way for new norms such as the UN Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted three years later in 1948.As we look at the current political situation, many signs suggest that we're arriving at a new, historic tipping point. The globally dominant neoliberal political-economic system has caused unprecedented wealth and income inequalities, which have destabilized the foundations on which the past seventy years of relative peace and prosperity have been built. The Brexit shock, the rise of neo-fascism in Europe, and the impending cataclysm of Trump's lawless brutality seem to signal an approaching tipping point. Our global society is most likely about to enter a phase transition, after which it will emerge into a new, stable state.What will that new state look like? There is a real threat that we'll see the end of democracy in this country. An even grimmer possibility is the total collapse of civilization. Trump's narcissistic capriciousness could drive the world to global war which might easily go nuclear. Even without war, we can expect an acceleration of climate change following an orgy of fossil fuel extraction from the new Exxon Mobil/Trump/Putin axis, which could drive the climate to its own tipping points that may be incompatible with continued civilization.Towards a Great Transformation of values?But there's another possibility for the long-term outcome of this dark period. The American people will only take so much trampling over accepted norms. Trump, with his cabinet of billionaires and corporate titans, is likely to pursue a strategy of continued reckless violations of traditional American values such as decency and civil rights. There's a real possibility that their frenzy of greed, bigotry, and hatred will catalyze a powerful counter-reaction. A significant majority of voters already chose the Democratic candidate over Trump at the election. After years of having their rights trampled upon by a Trump presidency, and most likely witnessing brutality once unthinkable in their own country, Americans may be ready for a radically different type of society: one based on values such as dignity, compassion, and fairness.This leads to another important lesson from complexity science: During a phase transition, a system goes through a chaotic period of shifting power dynamics. In this period, seemingly insignificant actions can have an outsize effect, sometimes dramatically impacting the character of the long-term outcome. When we apply this lesson to the current situation, this becomes a clarion call for citizen action. What each of us does over the next few years could have extraordinary effects on the future society we bequeath to posterity.For those who care about humanity, many of our actions will need to respond directly to Trump's brutalism. To counter his xenophobia, we must support the sanctuary movement and resist his onslaught on Muslims. We need to protest forcefully when he doubles down on fossil fuel extraction and cuts taxes for his billionaire friends. We must guard diligently against any normalization in the media of his regime.At the same time, we need to shine a light on a flourishing future that could still be available after this period of darkness. There is an enormous power arising from millions of interconnected people striving together towards a shared vision. We already know, within ourselves, what that vision looks like. In contrast to Trump's intolerance based on a rhetoric of separation, the foundation of a flourishing future is our intrinsic connectedness: within ourselves, with others, and with the natural world.Even before Trump's regime begins, people are picking up on the urgent need for a transformation of values in American society. Political commentator Van Jones has initiated a ""Love Army"" to conquer Trump's message of hate. Author Neal Gabler has called for a ""kindness offensive.""A society based on love and kindness is not just an abstraction. Kindness in action means resisting Trump's brutalism. Love in action means working towards a transformation of society. Pioneers of a flourishing future have already been busily constructing a coherent platform of alternative ideas that can form the framework for a system founded on compassionate values. I've attempted to summarize some of them in a recent online conference where I took the role of a historian in 2050 looking back at how the world just survived climate catastrophe to enter a period known as The Great Transformation.The traditional Chinese understood profoundly the dynamics of change that modern complexity scientists are discovering. Their famous yin-yang symbol captures a deep truth about how polarities can engender their opposites. In the middle of the black, there is a spot of white. When a wave reaches its peak, that's when it begins to crash. The darkest hour is just before the dawn.We haven't yet hit the darkest hour of the Trump era. We're just entering the abyss, and no-one can predict how bad it's going to get. But as we move together into the darkness, along with our anguish and outrage, let us never lose sight of the light that lurks beyond. There will be casualties from his brutality. Few of us are likely to make it through unscathed. But by recognizing the power of our interconnected action, while keeping our gaze focused on the light beyond the horizon, we may well succeed in ultimately directing this tipping point away from collapse, and towards a society of flourishing, compassion, and justice.Original post: Patterns Of MeaningJeremy Lent’s book, The Patterning Instinct: A Cultural History of Humanity’s Search for Meaning, will be published by Prometheus Books in May 2017."

The globally dominant neoliberal political-economic system has caused unprecedented wealth and income inequalities, which have destabilized the foundations on which the past seventy years of relative peace and prosperity have been built. The Brexit shock, the rise of neo-fascism in Europe, and the impending cataclysm of Trump's lawless brutality seem to signal an approaching tipping point. Our global society is most likely about to enter a phase transition, after which it will emerge into a new, stable state.What will that new state look like? There is a real threat that we'll see the end of democracy in this country. An even grimmer possibility is the total collapse of civilization. Trump's narcissistic capriciousness could drive the world to global war which might easily go nuclear. Even without war, we can expect an acceleration of climate change following an orgy of fossil fuel extraction from the new Exxon Mobil/Trump/Putin axis, which could drive the climate to its own tipping points that may be incompatible with continued civilization.Towards a Great Transformation of values?But there's another possibility for the long-term outcome of this dark period. The American people will only take so much trampling over accepted norms. Trump, with his cabinet of billionaires and corporate titans, is likely to pursue a strategy of continued reckless violations of traditional American values such as decency and civil rights. There's a real possibility that their frenzy of greed, bigotry, and hatred will catalyze a powerful counter-reaction. A significant majority of voters already chose the Democratic candidate over Trump at the election. After years of having their rights trampled upon by a Trump presidency, and most likely witnessing brutality once unthinkable in their own country, Americans may be ready for a radically different type of society: one based on values such as dignity, compassion, and fairness.This leads to another important lesson from complexity science: During a phase transition, a system goes through a chaotic period of shifting power dynamics. In this period, seemingly insignificant actions can have an outsize effect, sometimes dramatically impacting the character of the long-term outcome. When we apply this lesson to the current situation, this becomes a clarion call for citizen action. What each of us does over the next few years could have extraordinary effects on the future society we bequeath to posterity.For those who care about humanity, many of our actions will need to respond directly to Trump's brutalism. To counter his xenophobia, we must support the sanctuary movement and resist his onslaught on Muslims. We need to protest forcefully when he doubles down on fossil fuel extraction and cuts taxes for his billionaire friends. We must guard diligently against any normalization in the media of his regime.At the same time, we need to shine a light on a flourishing future that could still be available after this period of darkness. There is an enormous power arising from millions of interconnected people striving together towards a shared vision. We already know, within ourselves, what that vision looks like. In contrast to Trump's intolerance based on a rhetoric of separation, the foundation of a flourishing future is our intrinsic connectedness: within ourselves, with others, and with the natural world.Even before Trump's regime begins, people are picking up on the urgent need for a transformation of values in American society. Political commentator Van Jones has initiated a ""Love Army"" to conquer Trump's message of hate. Author Neal Gabler has called for a ""kindness offensive.""A society based on love and kindness is not just an abstraction. Kindness in action means resisting Trump's brutalism. Love in action means working towards a transformation of society. Pioneers of a flourishing future have already been busily constructing a coherent platform of alternative ideas that can form the framework for a system founded on compassionate values. I've attempted to summarize some of them in a recent online conference where I took the role of a historian in 2050 looking back at how the world just survived climate catastrophe to enter a period known as The Great Transformation.The traditional Chinese understood profoundly the dynamics of change that modern complexity scientists are discovering. Their famous yin-yang symbol captures a deep truth about how polarities can engender their opposites. In the middle of the black, there is a spot of white. When a wave reaches its peak, that's when it begins to crash. The darkest hour is just before the dawn.We haven't yet hit the darkest hour of the Trump era. We're just entering the abyss, and no-one can predict how bad it's going to get. But as we move together into the darkness, along with our anguish and outrage, let us never lose sight of the light that lurks beyond. There will be casualties from his brutality. Few of us are likely to make it through unscathed. But by recognizing the power of our interconnected action, while keeping our gaze focused on the light beyond the horizon, we may well succeed in ultimately directing this tipping point away from collapse, and towards a society of flourishing, compassion, and justice.Original post: Patterns Of MeaningJeremy Lent’s book, The Patterning Instinct: A Cultural History of Humanity’s Search for Meaning, will be published by Prometheus Books in May 2017."

Is it any surprise that in Europe, one philanthropist has offered a $5 million prize to anyone who can come up with a new improved, system of global governance – a redesigned “UN 2.0”?While the failings of the UN Security Council are many and real, it is heartening to see some achievements. This week, with strong leadership from the Government of Spain and many civil society organisations, including our partners the Freedom Fund and walkfree.org, the UN Security Council voted to adopt a resolution on human trafficking in conflict.Some aspects of the Resolution seem fairly run of the mill and perhaps innocuous. For example, the Resolution calls on Members States that have not done so to ratify and implement UN Convention Transnational Organised Crime and Trafficking Protocol. This is something that 147 states have already done, including Syria.Some aspects of the Resolution will have far more immediate consequences to people who are suffering and desperately seeking justice. The Resolution calls on Member States to prevent, criminalise, investigate, and ensure accountability for those who engage in human trafficking in armed conflict. The Resolution emphasises that evidence of such crimes must be collected and preserved so that investigations and prosecutions can occur.The focus on documenting war crimes is critical. One of the hard-learnt lessons from the liberation of German concentration camps after World War II was the importance of collecting even rough stories, information, and testimonies from survivors, as soon as possible after camps were liberated. These accounts are rapidly lost as people move, memory becomes less reliable, victims die and any prospect of justice is lost.The Resolution has profound implications for the identification and response to victims of human trafficking in conflict situations. The Resolution calls for the UN and States to implement robust victim identification to provide access to protection for victims - whether they are in refugee camps in Iraq or living in relative safety in Europe. The Resolution urges UN agencies involved in humanitarian crises to ensure risk of trafficking is considered in humanitarian needs assessments. This is an approach the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) has long called for, on the basis of its experiences working with trafficking victims in times of crisis.As IOM and others have highlighted, too often in emergency situations, there is a failure to see that responding to human trafficking is in fact lifesaving emergency aid. For the women who have escaped sexual enslavement at the hands of ISIS, responding to their situation is not an optional extra that can be dealt with later, after the basics of food, water and shelter have been administered.The Resolution encourages partnerships between private sector and civil society to provide information, and calls for identification of “indicators of trafficking in persons in areas affected by armed conflict in supply chains”. With an increasing global focus on the ability of businesses to impact human rights, it is timely to ask - who is providing the weapons and other defence materiel that is sustaining the seemingly intractable conflicts we are witnessing? This may have implications for businesses who provide not just weapons but any materiel, including vehicles and heavy machinery.From a migration perspective, the Resolution urges refugee-receiving countries to “provide information on the services available to victims of trafficking and sexual violence”, and “provide survivors with the option to document their cases for future legal action to hold traffickers accountable”. This has important implications for justice, as well as supporting identification of terrorist groups, cutting access to resources and preventing further forms of terrorist activity.At the operational level, the resolution encourages Member States involved in peacekeeping to ensure training and operational readiness on this issue. This is critical - imagine you are a soldier providing security for a refugee camp, and a woman walks up to you and says “I want to report a war crime”. This is not fiction - this happens. Soldiers need to know what to do.Finally, the UN Security Council has requested the Secretary General to take steps to improve the collection of data, monitoring and analysis of trafficking in persons in context of armed conflict. We already know there is a strong link between conflict and modern slavery but collecting the data is rarely prioritised. Stronger data means more informed responses - this is needed, ideally linked to collection of testimonies and war crimes.The failures of the UN Security Council remain a very real challenge for us today, and we must collectively find solutions. This should not stop us recognising critical, life-saving progress that is being made along the way."

And I believe the Democratic Party is the only party that can do it. Democrats win when we harness the power of everyday people and fight for the issues they care about. Standing with working people is the soul of our party. We must be with them fighting for a better wage, for affordable college, for the right to join and stand with a union, and for the end to prejudice and hate crimes. When voters know what Democrats stand for, we can improve the lives of all Americans, no matter their race, religion or sexual orientation.But this election cycle, we didn’t do a good enough job. We lost. And now, it’s time to put it all on the line. That’s why I’m willing to give up my Congressional seat, and to work night and day to strengthen the Democratic Party.I’ve won eight elections myself, two in the Minnesota State Legislature, and six to the United States Congress. I also know how to get others elected. I’ve fought year-round to increase voter turnout and develop real relationships with voters. And it’s worked. In Minnesota in 2014, a Democratic governor and senator were on the ballot who had both won their previous elections in squeaker recounts. My district increased the Democratic turnout by 13,000 votes — and both were elected in blowouts. This year, my turnout strategy helped deliver Minnesota for Hillary Clinton, while the rest of the Midwest went for Trump.A DNC that is able to take on Republicans and President Trump needs to prioritize grassroots organizing and voter turnout, like we do in Minnesota. For the Democratic Party to win elections, from the city council to the White House, we must invest in and empower our state and local parties, and we must train a bench of diverse, qualified candidates to be ready to run. We need a DNC that isn’t just a political organization or a fundraising apparatus, but a true organizing tool, from the grassroots up. We need a DNC that works for every Democrat, in every precinct, in every state – from Montgomery to Flint, from Los Angeles to Tampa. Simply put, we need a DNC that works for all of us. Our party is right. Our values are just. Our future depends on grassroots organizing. When Democrats champion the challenges of working families, voters will have a reason to show up at the polls in 2017, 2018, and beyond.Let’s get to work.- Keith"

Many of these messages came during a time when there was still a lack of information on the suspect, motive or how exactly these events transpired.While German officials said they were assessing whether the Berlin truck attack was an accident or deliberate, Trump had already called it a terror act and suggested it was related to an Islamist “global jihad” against Christians. Earlier in the day, he described the Turkey attack as carried out by a “radical Islamic terrorist,” even though it’s unclear what association the attacker’s religion had with the killing.In France, populist far-right National Front leader Marine le Pen issued a statement blaming immigration policy for the Berlin attack. Dutch anti-Islam politician Geert Wilders accused European leaders of letting “Islamic terror” into the continent and tweeted out a photoshopped image of German Chancellor Angela Merkel with blood on her hands. Britain’s Nigel Farage said the events would be “Merkel’s legacy” and called them “no surprise.” Germany’s own far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party also targeted Merkel and Germany’s immigration policy. Vice Chair of the AfD Beatrix von Storch told the BBC that they held the chancellor personally responsible for the attack, and leader Frauke Petry said “Germany is not safe anymore” in a statement on Facebook.These figures were quick to speak out on the attack in Berlin in part because it appeared to play into many of the issues that are hallmarks of the populist far-right’s rhetoric. Buoyed by the refugee crisis, cracks in the European Union and a number of terror attacks in recent years, many of these far-right parties have grown through appeals to nativism and anti-Islam sentiment. In cases where the attack is carried out by an Islamist extremist group or an immigrant ― as is the case in Berlin where authorities are searching for a Tunisian asylum seeker thought to have links to Islamist radicals ― these parties tout the tragedies as vindication of their views. Party leaders often also dismiss calls for a more nuanced understanding of these attacks or for people to not jump to hatred in the aftermath as “political correctness,” as AfD leader Petry did on Tuesday.Far-right politicians hope to use such appeals to mobilize their base and draw more people into their party, analysts say, especially as both France and Germany are heading into key elections next year. The National Front and AfD are expected to have a considerable affect on the political landscape during those respective elections. Germany’s AfD could become the country’s third-largest party, while the National Front’s Le Pen is expected to lose France’s vote in a second round runoff.“[Far-right parties] end up setting the agenda, they may not win … but these parties are very successful at setting political agendas, they draw everybody to the right with them,” Martin Schain, a New York University professor whose work focuses on European politics, told The WorldPost. “It’s true in the UK, it’s true in France and it may become increasingly true in Germany.”Merkel’s announcement earlier this month that she supports a partial ban on face veils was a notable example of how the growth of the AfD has already shifted policy.

There are better solutions.",2016-12-21,"U.S. President-elect Donald Trump speaks during an event at Carrier Corp. in Indianapolis, Indiana, on Dec. 1.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585ad2331c00000a070ecdf2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The rise and electoral successes of populist politicians in the West have reopened questions on the effects of globalization ― in simplest terms, whether uneven distributional effects of globalization are to blame for widespread dissatisfaction in wealthy countries, or does the fault lie with domestic policies or other factors. The responses will shape globalization in this century and could offer remedies for popular discontent.First, the facts. There is no doubt that the growth rates of the bottom halves of income distributions for rich countries have been low over the past 25 years. This stands in contrast to the high growth rates of Asian middle classes – people poorer than the Western middle class but with whom Western workers may be competing for jobs – and the so-called top one-percenters. Consider real per-capita growth for the middle 10 percent (middle decile) of rich countries. From 1988 to 2011, average annual growth for this group was 0.5 percent in the United States and Germany, 1.7 percent in France and 1.9 percent in the United Kingdom. Over the same period, the middle deciles in urban and rural China have grown by 6 and 8 percent per annum, respectively, 4 percent in Thailand and 8 percent in Vietnam.Broadly, the average income growth of a median household in Asia was about four times as high as one in the West.Perhaps such a difference in outcomes would not have mattered so much to the Western middle classes if slow growth rates were shared in each nation. But that was not the case: The top decile has seen incomes rise by more than 3 percent per annum in the U.S. and by more than 4 percent in the U.K. Moreover, the disproportion increases with level of income. Those with yet higher incomes in the West, the famous top 1 percent, enjoyed even higher growth rates during the past 25 years.The middle class of the rich world thus found itself squeezed between the poorer but fast-growing Asian middle and the much richer and also fast-growing domestic top 1 percent ― and many blamed globalization.How to apportion the blame? While the facts are incontrovertible, the causes are not. There are three possible explanations for the uneven growth: technological change driving productivity up among highly skilled workers compared to the low-skilled; globalization making Western workers uncompetitive in comparison to Asians; or policies that favored the rich through tax cuts.A policy response to popular anger over globalization depends on the principal cause. If technological change is the cause, there is little governments can do other than compensate the losers. They cannot order technological change to be of one kind and not another. If it is globalization, then governments can take steps to reverse globalization in some segments by limiting openness to trade or free movement of capital. If the problem is economic policy, then governments are the lead culprit.The three factors cannot be analytically separated. Empirical attempts to disentangle the effects of globalization from technological change have been inconclusive, and the exercise is futile.Technological change and globalization go hand in hand. Researchers cannot measure inequality as if there had been no globalization while technological progress went on as before. Technological progress responds to incentives and what globalization offers. Innovations are embodied in new products and services, in new laptops or smartphones, and how these are produced depends on globalization. If labor costs were higher ― for example, if U.S. producers could not rely on low-cost foreign supply chains ― then some high-tech machines, whether assembly robots in manufacturing, precision GPS chemical applicators for the agriculture industry or automated longwall shearers in the mining industry, may not exist at all. Producers and consumers would have simpler machines and goods.Moreover, the products themselves push new waves of technological progress in specific directions. If the iPhone was not relatively affordable for about 3 billion customers, there would be little commercial interest in creating new applications ― and there would be no Uber or growing gig economy that relies on it. Widespread technology was made possible not just by technological progress in Silicon Valley but also the ability to outsource production to low-wage locations. And that in turn has fed into new technological advances. For Uber is little more than the old-fashioned gypsy cab, glorified with new technology and magnified to the global scale.Likewise, economic policy cannot be meaningfully separated. The principal reason why tax rates were reduced lies in mobility of capital and highly paid individuals. That mobility is made possible by globalization, with funds easily moved around the world, and by technological progress that allows individuals to work remotely, sometimes thousands of miles from what would have been their workplace in the old-fashioned world.For these reasons, distributional outcomes must be regarded as the products of interrelated forces of all three phenomena ― technology, globalization and economic policy. Taking any two as given and changing the third may be an interesting mental exercise, but has no meaning in the real world.Solutions are not easy. A basic contradiction of the age of globalization is that economic outcomes for increasing numbers of people are determined at the global level, while political action takes place within nation-states. National governments are put in the position of doing mop-up operations for whatever category of workers is affected by lower wages or layoffs that in turn may be due to new ways of making goods or rendering services invented in China, India, the U.S. or elsewhere.But it could be argued that this has always been the case. British competition destroyed Indian textiles in the late 19th century. What is new, however, is the scale of such globally driven changes that can emanate from any part of the globe and spread much more rapidly than in the past.Middle classes went along with globalization as long as they anticipated tangible benefits or so long as the numbers of the disaffected were insufficient to be a credible political force. But that has changed, as demonstrated by Britain’s vote to withdraw from the European Union and the U.S. election of Donald Trump. What are the governments in the wealthiest nations then to do, short of trying to reverse parts of today’s globalization and in the process shrinking their own growth rates as well as those of emerging-market economies. There are better solutions.Remedies for reduced inequality of the 20th century won’t work in the 21st century. The old remedies included mass education, large unionized labor and tax-and-spend policies. All of these have reached their limits.A more promising avenue for dealing with inequality in rich countries for the 21st century is to reduce inequality in human and financial capital endowments. This implies, first, reversing the currently extraordinary high concentration of capital assets by giving the middle classes fiscal and other incentives to invest and own assets and, second, equalizing access to high-quality education that is increasingly monopolized by the rich.If inequality at the pre-distribution stage is less, then the government’s redistributive role can be smaller. Such nations can be more agile in global competition because they won’t have to permanently fret whether the political consensus behind such policies may collapse at any point. The policy can be summarized under the title of globalization with equalization of domestic opportunities."

It was inevitable.,2016-12-21,The farewell ceremony for Russian Ambassador to Turkey Andrey Karlov in Moscow on Dec. 22.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585c193d1c00000a070ed11b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The assassination of Russia’s ambassador to Turkey should shock or surprise no one. It was inevitable, as are many more such terrorist acts against Russia.Call Russia’s involvement in Syria a geopolitically motivated intervention or call it a war crime. From the point of view of many Syrians, most anti-Assad rebels, the so-called Islamic State and many radical Muslims the world over, Russia’s bombardment of Aleppo and other cities is a criminal assault against all Muslims and Islam. We may disagree. And Putin certainly disagrees. But just as he believes he is entitled ruthlessly to pursue Russia’s interests, so, too, his opponents believe they are entitled to pursue theirs — no less ruthlessly.If Russia’s Islamist opponents cannot defeat Putin on the battlefield — and, thus far, they have not been able to do so — they will resort to the only weapon that all weaker forces have at their disposal: terrorism.One year ago, ISIS brought down a Russian airliner over Egypt. Now, a radical Islamist shot the Russian ambassador to Turkey. In the months ahead, expect Islamist terrorists to mobilize against “soft” Russian targets throughout the world. No Russian diplomat, businessman or tourist and no Russian embassy, consulate, mission or business will be safe from the acts of lone wolves acting without regard for their own survival.France, Belgium and Germany were the targets of the most recent terrorist acts. Now, it’s the turn of Russians — both in Russia and especially outside of Russia, where Russians are particularly vulnerable to violence.Thousands of ISIS’s militants hail from Russia or former Soviet countries and speak fluent Russian. Some will return to spread havoc; others will draw on their friends, relatives and supporters in Russia and elsewhere. Russians still remember the terrorist assaults in Moscow in 2002 and in Beslan in 2004 that cost hundreds of lives. Unfortunately, they will experience more such assaults.Putin will want to retaliate. But, since the threat will mostly come from terrorists acting on their own, his bluster will not result in effective countermeasures. He will pressure foreign states to protect Russians but they, too, will be largely impotent to stop lone wolves.There is no stopping an assassin who wants to die for the cause.Russians, both at home and abroad, will increasingly view their macho dictator with disdain, if, as seems likely, he fails to protect his compatriots and stop the attacks.Could his growing impotence undermine his legitimacy and stability? Quite possibly: Putin’s rule rests on his strongman image and his ability to act violently, even brutally, if Russian interests are in danger.Russia’s intervention in Syria was, as some analysts suggested, almost certain to end in disaster for the country. At best, it would mean a long-term occupation — a quagmire. At worst, it could lead to the deaths of many regime cronies and innocent Russians.Putin’s recent barbarism in Aleppo may hasten both results.Thanks to him, anti-Russian terrorism is the new normal."

In this HuffPost Queer Voices “Let Love Define Family®” series installment, RaiseAChild contributing writer Eric Criswell, sits down with an amazing former foster youth turned philanthropist. In my two-hour conversation with Bill Dickinson, a gay gentleman in his seventies and filled with a lifetime of experience and wisdom, he asked me a question, “Doesn’t everyone learn by example?” Bill continued, “I assume you were watching your father and learning what kind of man you wanted to be or didn’t want to be. Since I didn’t have my father, I kept looking around for people I admired and wanted to emulate.” One of those people that Bill came to emulate was Byron Stookey, the Chancellor’s assistant at the University of California at Santa Cruz (UCSC). As a young man in his late teens, Bill had just been accepted at the university and was eager to start his studies, and hopefully a new direction in his life. His hopes were quickly diminished upon receipt of a letter that required him to pay out-of-state tuition due to his mother residing in Nevada. Knowing this meant he could not afford to attend the university, he wrote the Chancellor and pleaded his case that he had been on his own since he was sixteen, had been a California taxpayer during the intervening years, and had never been to Nevada, where his mother was in a mental hospital. Mr. Stookey invited him to come to his office to discuss. After they spoke, Bill was assured that this problem would be taken care of and he could start his classes. Bill pointed out, “Not only did he solve the problem, but he became the mentor I had wanted for years: a man to whom I could look up, who treated me with respect, and who was available to be my friend without expecting anything from me except that I should improve myself.” That experience and philosophy has continued to this day, not just for Bill, who graduated from UCSC and had very successful careers in education and government, but in the pioneering program he established at the university named the Smith Renaissance Society (http://smithsociety.ucsc.edu). The Society is truly place where students can belong. Initially constructed as a scholarship program to assist foster children and orphans. It started to feel too ‘transactional’ and Bill returned to the drawing board to craft the Society into something that would be more beneficial than just meeting the financial needs of students. “I wanted to create a true society, one in which students could actually belong, build relationships with each other and their mentors, be encouraged in the fact that their life means something and that there are people who care about them.” Bill continued, “It is a place that you are respected for who you are, and I know for me, that was turning point that changed my life.” At age six Bill’s family was torn apart as his father had left him and his three siblings alone with his mother who had to work nights as a waitress to meet their needs. The stress of life in the 1950’s as a single mother took its toll. She was diagnosed with schizophrenia and the children were separated and put in the foster care system. Between the ages of six and fifteen, he was moved thirteen times to various families until he struck off on his own, determined to take control of his situation. Bill explains, “I understood wanting to be in the driver’s seat and being in control of your life at that age. There comes a point in a person’s life when making decisions about your own life is what healthy development is all about.” Having always enjoyed school, he enrolled in a community college. Then was excited to be accepted at the newly formed UCSC for its inaugural year, which he pointed out makes him the first foster kid to attend that university. Upon arriving there he was treated the same as anyone else, from the initial experience with Byron Stookey, to the respect he was shown by Page and Eloise Smith who were professors at the time and are the reason for naming his group the Smith Renaissance Society.A current student, Lexie Tapke, who plans to graduate in 2018, is majoring in Literature. A passionate writer, she aims to pursue this professionally. When she joined the Smith Society she was matched with USCS alumna Janice Lasnier, a local graphic designer who has mentored seven Smith students. She had envisioned having a mentor in her own field and was surprised to find that Janice gave her support that she didn’t even know she needed. Said Lexie, “Someone with whom I can be relaxed and casual, Janice supported me right off the bat. When I needed a job she gave me contacts. When I needed to pay for a dentist, she put me in touch with Smith’s Financial Aid person. I’m independent, but there will always be things with which I will need help. It’s incredibly empowering being in college on your own. Janice is not a crutch but a wise friend, always more than willing to help.” “My main philosophy, and that of the Society is that if you look at a young person and see promise, you see something different then if you look at a kid and see an at-risk youth.” Bill emphasizes, “I know how it changed my life being a student and being treated with respect. It is what all humans want.” Simply put, the Society is a group of friends and mentors who are there to encourage each other and make sure that the kids have the best college experience, both educationally and socially. So much effort is put into keeping bad things from happening to our youth in society, but so little attention is given to making sure some good things happen to them as well, and this is the mission of the Society. “Most students today can leave college without having built any close relationships or anyone that can write an honest recommendation letter. Our kids have a lifelong network of peers and adults that truly care for them and their success after leaving the university.” The Smith Renaissance Society began as a group for foster children and orphans, but has expanded to include students who have parents in prison or have been deported, LGBT kids who have been abandoned by their families, or as Bill likes to explain, “It is open to anyone who wants to call home, but doesn’t have anyone to call home to.” This is especially true during the holidays when the Society makes sure that each and every member has a place to stay, whether with family, friends, or they get special permission to remain as a group in the dorms during the holiday break. During this holiday season, there are so many organizations that appeal for donations, but Bill offers advice on a way to change a child’s life by just taking the time to see them for the human being they are. He explains, “One of the homes I lived in as a foster child was awful, there was constant arguing and criticizing and making me feel like I was unworthy of love. One day my Latin teacher took me aside and put his arm around me and simply said, ‘You are going to be ok.’ That one day, that one comment made all the difference to me. At the right moment if you just put your arm around a kid and say you are going to be ok, it may be all it takes to get them through.” Have you thought about building a family through fostering or adoption?

LOUIS ― Missouri State Rep.-elect Bruce Franks Jr. was robbed at gunpoint Monday night in St. Louis, police said.Franks was sitting in his car in the parking lot of a popular St. Louis brewery and restaurant about 7:20 p.m. when two men robbed him, police said. Franks was unharmed, but his car, two cell phones and a handgun were among the items stolen, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.Franks wrote a statement on Facebook that offered little detail about the incident but said he was glad to be alive.Franks, a Ferguson, Missouri, activist, is a 32-year-old business owner, father and former battle rapper who conducts community outreach with his organization 28-to-Life, which focuses on youth empowerment and police relations with communities. The political newcomer won a seat in Missouri’s House of Representatives in a September special election after he challenged voter irregularities in St. Louis’ 78th District during the August Democratic primary. A St. Louis circuit court judge found that the St. Louis Board of Election Commissioners collected over 100 invalid absentee mail-in votes.Last month, The Huffington Post sat down with Franks to talk about his organization and the struggles within impoverished black communities. “We talk about conditions in our neighborhoods and how we don’t have choices in our neighborhoods,” Franks said in the November interview. “Yeah, they robbing and killing ― which I don’t condone at all ― but look at what’s their choice on survival. How do they survive?”“And the only right thing in the ’hood is surviving. No, they didn’t have a choice, and they had to go through this,” Franks continued. “A lot of times people who aren’t from the ’hood never really understood that. They don’t get that. They don’t get what it’s like to not have a choice.”During a campaign rally for former presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in March, Franks spoke about how gun violence had touched his life. In 1991, Franks’ brother, Christopher Harris, 9, was fatally shot.“He was used as a human shield,” Franks said at the campaign rally.With his new political role, Franks hopes to help put an end to gun violence and hold criminals accountable by “addressing the problem from its root causes, which is lack of resources, education, job opportunities,” Franks told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.Unfortunately, Franks is not the only Missouri politician affected by gun violence this month. On Dec. 5, Missouri Gov.-elect Eric Greitens’ wife, Sheena Greitens, was robbed at gunpoint while sitting in her car outside a St. Louis cafe. Three teenagers were later arrested in the case. "

For patients of women, mortality rates were 15.02 percent and readmissions rates were 11.07 percent, compared with 15.57 percent mortality and 11.49 percent readmission rates for patients of men.Readmission rates are important because they can signal a coordination gap between hospital employees and those responsible for the next stage in a patient’s care, according to The Washington Post. In other words, it’s a metric of doctor collaboration and follow-through.The study didn’t explain why women provided slightly better care to patients than men, but it corroborates previous research that suggests women on the whole provide better care to patients. For example, a paper published in the Journal of Internal Medicine in 2008 found that female physicians scored higher on quality of care and outcome measures while caring for patients with Type 2 diabetes. And while the results in the new study were modest, they have important real-world implications ― especially when it comes to the pronounced gender-based wage gap that exists in medicine. Currently, female physicians make and average $20,000 less than male counterparts, according to a study published in JAMA Internal Medicine in July.The wage gap “is particularly unconscionable given the performance of women in terms of providing high quality care,” Dr. Ashish Jha, a professor of health policy at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told STAT.Another real-world outcome: “We estimate that approximately 32,000 fewer patients would die if male physicians could achieve the same outcomes as female physicians every year,” the study authors wrote."

McConnell added that he was amazed Trump “pierced the blue wall” in the Rust Belt states, which were key in Clinton’s defeat. The stunning losses for Democrats have put them “in a very feisty mood these days,” McConnell said. The Republican leader, who took care to stay away from Trump as much as possible throughout the election, tried to quell concerns from a vast majority of Americans about the incoming president. Trump led one of the most vitriolic and divisive campaigns in recent history. “I know a lot of people are upset and bent out of shape about things that happened this year,” McConnell said. “I just want to remind everybody that this is an extraordinarily resilient country we live in.”"

The move brought the total number of people facing charges to 13.Former Flint emergency managers Darnell Earley and Gerald Ambrose both face multiple charges, including false pretenses and conspiring to commit false pretenses, felonies that each carry a 20-year sentence.Schuette also announced charges against former Director of Public Works Howard Croft and Daugherty Johnson, the department’s former utilities director.The state attorney general alleges that, as part of a plan to build a new water pipeline, the four defendants were involved in defrauding the state to borrow millions of dollars. And he accused them of authorizing the switch to Flint River water, despite knowing the treatment plant was not ready for service, sparking the crisis.The cash-strapped city stopped buying its water from the Detroit system, which draws from Lake Huron, and began using the Flint River in 2014 ― supposedly to cut costs. Residents began complaining soon after that their tap water was making them sick. Under direction of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, the city had failed to properly treat the water to prevent it from corroding pipes and lead leached into residents’ drinking water. Exposure to any amount of lead is a serious health risk ― particularly for young children, whose development it can impede.Schuette accused Earley and the other defendants of putting financial savings before residents’ safety.“All too prevalent, and very evident, during the course of this investigation has been a fixation on finances and balance sheets. This fixation has cost lives,” he said at a press conference Tuesday. “The tragedy that we know as the Flint water crisis did not occur by accident, no. Flint was a casualty of arrogance, disdain and a failure of management.”Earley, one of the most visible and publicly criticized figures in the crisis, was appointed emergency manager by Gov. Rick Snyder (R) in 2013, when the city was in financial distress.Before he left his post in early 2015, Earley was involved in a regional plan to build the Karegnondi Water Authority pipeline, which would allow Flint to get water directly from Lake Huron, rather than buying water from Detroit. According to Schuette, Flint’s existing debt load meant it couldn’t get loans from the state to fund its portion of construction costs. So the city misused an obscure exception that allows a waiver in the case of “fire, flood, or other calamity” to get funding that Earley intended to instead divert for construction of the KWA, prosecutors allege.Rather than renew a contract to purchase Detroit’s pretreated water, officials made plans to use the Flint River in the interim before the pipeline was complete, which required major upgrades to the water treatment plant.In the push to keep the KWA on track, Earley “allegedly allowed the Flint Water Treatment Plant to produce water despite knowledge the plant was not ready for use, allowed Flint to enter into a contract requiring use of the Flint Water Treatment Plant during that time, and authorized false and misleading public statements that the water was safe to drink,” according to Schuette.Ambrose worked with Earley as a finance director and succeeded him as emergency manager for a few months in 2015. Schuette alleges that he was directly involved in the pipeline plan.Additionally, prosecutors allege Ambrose “obstructed and hindered a healthcare investigation conducted by the Genesee County Health Department with regard to the Legionnaires’ disease outbreak.”An unusually high number of cases of Legionnaires’ disease were reported in Flint after the city switched water sources. Twelve deaths have been tied to the outbreak of the respiratory illness.The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality initially dismissed residents’ complaints about the water. However, it eventually acknowledged that there were elevated lead levels in the water and verified a pediatrician’s findings that there were an alarming number of children with elevated lead levels in their blood. The Michigan governor and President Barack Obama both declared emergencies in Flint early this year, and the city switched back to its original water source. There have been extensive efforts to respond to the crisis, including the expensive task of replacing lead service lines. Congress passed a bill this month that allocated $170 million in aid for Flint and other cities with contaminated drinking water, and recent testing shows lead levels are below federal action levels.However, residents are still required to use filtered or tap water. Both the city and state have been fighting a judge’s order requiring that they deliver water to any resident who needs it. Some have blamed the state’s controversial emergency manager law for creating the conditions that allowed the water crisis to occur. By definition, an emergency manager is an outsider tasked with hacking away at a city’s debt, not improving services, and is given sweeping authority over elected officials in order to make difficult, deep cuts. The law ― which has disproportionately affected black municipalities ― was repealed in a 2012 statewide referendum, but legislators quickly passed a new, stronger version.“Here we are more than two years since the water crisis began and we still have the same draconian law in place, Flint residents are still without clean, safe water, and Bill Schuette himself is fighting a federal court order to deliver life-saving water to residents who otherwise would be without,” Nayyirah Shariff, director of community activist group Flint Rising, said in a statement.“We are tired of the selective showboating being masked as justice. We demand complete justice now and we will not rest until we get it,” Shariff added.The eight state employees and one city official previously charged in Schuette’s ongoing investigation are all scheduled to appear in court Wednesday.This post has been updated with more details about the charges."

Tuter fired 41 shots at Allen’s vehicle.Seven of the jurors in the case were white. The panel’s racial demographics and the outcome of the trial are part of an ongoing debate about how race influences the judicial process for police officers on trial for murder or manslaughter in on-duty shootings.Prosecutors argued Tuter, now 36, had engaged in “reckless” and unlawful misconduct during the shooting, as police had already cornered Allen’s truck in a cul-de-sac when Tuter opened fire. Three bullets struck the 25-year-old driver.Tuter has maintained that he believed Allen was armed, and that he used lethal force because he feared for his life following a pursuit that had exceeded speeds of 100 mph before ending in the Dallas suburb of Mesquite. Officers from the Mesquite Police Department, who investigated the shooting but only arrived on the scene after it had taken place, testified in favor of Tuter.But other Garland police officers who witnessed the shooting testified against Tuter, claiming his actions were unnecessary. Tuter was the only officer who discharged his weapon during the encounter, and police reported that he had to reload twice amid the barrage.“His fellow officers felt more fear from Tuter’s actions than from the person they were chasing,” special prosecutor Juan Sanchez told The Huffington Post.Tuter was fired from the Garland Police Department in 2013, after an internal investigation concluded he’d violated numerous policies during the incident.On Monday morning, the jury foreman told Judge Quay Parker that the panel remained deadlocked, with a handful of jurors favoring conviction and the rest supporting acquittal. Sanchez said most of the jurors who supported convicting Tuter were people of color.With no hope of reaching a unanimous verdict, however, Parker announced a mistrial and dismissed the jurors. The prosecution will reconvene early next month to determine how to proceed, Sanchez said.Efforts to prosecute officers for fatal shootings often fail, according to research by Philip Stinson, an associate professor of criminology at Ohio’s Bowling Green State University who has compiled nationwide data on the prosecution of officers facing murder or manslaughter charges for on-duty shootings since 2005.Although most officers don’t face charges in these incidents, juries often side with officers when they do rule on cases like this.“Jurors are often reluctant to second-guess the split-second life-or-death decisions of police officers in violent street encounters while on duty,” Stinson told HuffPost in a recent interview.But the racial makeup of juries may also have an effect on the outcome of these cases. A HuffPost investigation published last week found that whites have been substantially overrepresented on juries in police shooting trials. Including Tuter’s case, majority-white juries have now decided 12 of the 14 police shooting cases since August 2014 ― when a Ferguson, Missouri, police officer shot and killed 18-year-old Michael Brown. (A grand jury ultimately declined to charge the officer, Darren Wilson.)As with most of these police shooting cases, the racial composition of the jury in Tuter’s trial wasn’t consistent with local demographics. Whites represent around 30 percent of the population in Dallas County, according to census estimates, yet they made up nearly 60 percent of the jurors.Although jury pools are supposed to reflect a cross-section of the surrounding area, there is no requirement to seat a panel that looks like the community it’s representing.A 1986 Supreme Court ruling prohibits attorneys from excluding potential jurors based upon their race or gender, but critics say lawyers routinely circumvent these protections and use the selection process to assemble largely white juries that may be more likely to side with them. These jury trends are particularly concerning in police shooting cases. Surveys show white Americans are more likely to express pro-law enforcement views than nonwhite Americans. White Americans are also less likely to be acquainted with or sympathetic to issues of race and policing that many see as integral to these cases.Sixty-eight percent of white respondents reported having favorable views of local police in a poll released in early December, compared with only 40 percent of African-Americans and 59 percent of Hispanics. In the same survey, just 35 percent of whites said police are too quick to use lethal force, compared with 73 percent of African-Americans and 54 percent of Hispanics. And 64 percent of whites were highly confident that their local police departments treat all racial groups equally, a position shared by just 31 percent of African-Americans and 42 percent of Hispanics.With just a few of these police shooting cases going before juries each year, it’s still impossible to discern a clear correlation between the racial makeup of a jury and the likelihood that it will result in a conviction. The individual facts of each case matter, and just because a juror is white doesn’t mean he or she will side with the police officer. Nor will a juror of color necessarily side against one.But the racial demographics of the jury in Tuter’s case further suggest that white Americans are getting disproportionate power when it comes to meting out justice for police officers who are charged with grave misconduct."

For a huge part of my life I didn’t really want to think about it.” The interview is part of a new documentary about his charity Sentebale, which he set up in memory of his mother. The organization, which he founded with Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, supports orphans and other vulnerable children in Africa, many of whom are affected by HIV or AIDS.Harry said his involvement with the initiative, which was also a cause close to Diana’s heart, helped him to eventually explore and process his grief.“I now view life very differently from what it used to be,” he said. “I used to bury my head in the sand, and let everything around you tear you to pieces.”Harry isn’t alone in how he managed his emotions. Many struggle with opening up about how they’re feeling following a tragic event and research shows people often yearn for the lost person long after they're gone. Of course, there isn’t one perfect way to grieve ― everyone’s process is different ― but experts say that talking about and acknowledging your sadness can help. And if it gets too overwhelming, it’s never a bad idea to seek professional support.Harry also opened up about his mother’s passing at an event honoring athletes dealing with mental health challenges.“You know, I really regret not ever talking about it,” Harry said, adding that he only recently started focusing on his psychological well-being.Props to the prince for sharing his own experiences as a way to help others.

74,POLITICS,Scott Walker Asks Donald Trump For More Power Over Refugee Resettlement,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/scott-walker-trump-refugees_us_585955dee4b0b3ddfd8ec448,The Wisconsin governor once tried to block Syrian refugees from his state.,2016-12-20,President-elect Donald Trump and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker: united in keeping out refugees.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58595e36120000590eef05d9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) is restarting his fight against accepting refugees next year ― this time with an ally in the White House.On Tuesday, the governor sent a letter to President-elect Donald Trump that has several requests from the state of Wisconsin, including having “a broader role in determining how many refugees and from which countries until we are comfortable with the vetting process that is being utilized to screen these individuals,” referring to people “from countries with terrorist ties.”The letter does not single out Syrians, although Walker has said many times before that he does not want them in his state. He sent the letter at the height of a months-long siege and bombing campaign that left thousands of civilians dead or displaced in the rebel-held city of Aleppo. Trump initially campaigned on a promise to keep all Muslims from entering the U.S., then said he would bar people from certain countries affected by terrorism. He also said he would ban Syrian refugees from coming to the country, based on speculation that they could be terrorists and a false claim that they are barely vetted before being admitted into the U.S. That means he could be sympathetic to Walker’s plea for more power over refugee resettlement. It’s not clear what “broader role” Walker was requesting, and a spokeswoman for the governor did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But Walker was one of many governors in November 2015 who called for a ban on Syrian refugees and said his state would not cooperate in accepting them.Those efforts failed, because governors cannot dictate federal immigration policy or ban certain people from their states. Some states, not including Wisconsin, withdrew from the refugee resettlement program entirely because they couldn’t block Syrians, even though doing so doesn’t actually keep anyone out.Walker told the Associated Press this week that he made his request to Trump because he believes states should get more information about refugees. “As far as we can tell, they’re just fully integrating these individuals into the communities that they’re in, which doesn’t really fit with the definition of refugee,” Walker said. “We have no idea how many people may have ties to the Islamic State or to other forms of radical Islamic terrorism or jihadist groups, and I think it’s a legitimate public safety concern.”Integration is actually a stated goal of their resettlement once the federal government places refugees in states. According to the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement, “integration is one of the key factors to refugee self-sufficiency.” Organizations work to help newly arrived refugees get jobs, enroll their children in school and join community groups. Refugees who are lawfully present in the U.S. are placed within specific states, but then allowed to move wherever they want, just like anyone else. Refugees go through extensive vetting ― far more than people coming to the U.S. through other legal means ― before being accepted into the country. Only a tiny fraction of refugees are resettled at all, and those who are can’t pick whether they end up in the U.S. or somewhere else. Federal law enforcement officials have expressed some concerns about the challenge of vetting Syrian refugees, but have not said it is impossible, as Walker, Trump and others have claimed. FBI Director James Comey is often cited as a source for those statements, although he in fact said “there is no risk-free process” but that the government had become “dramatically better” at vetting in the past eight years. Backlash against Syrian refugees within the U.S. has often flared based on threats from people who weren’t Syrian ― or weren’t even refugees. The State Department said last year that only about a dozen of the nearly 785,000 refugees admitted into the U.S. since 9/11 “have been arrested or removed from the U.S. due to terrorism concerns that existed prior to their resettlement in the U.S. None of them were Syrian.”About 60 percent of the Syrians resettled in the U.S. in the 2016 fiscal year were under the age of 18, according to the State Department. Wisconsin admitted about 1,690 refugees, from about 590 families, during the same time period. Only 21 of those families ― about 100 individuals total ― were from Syria. "

The victims have yet to be publicly identified, but six are German citizens.Authorities continue looking for suspects after detaining and releasing a 23-year-old asylum-seeker from Pakistan, who denied involvement.German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she was “shocked, shaken and deeply saddened” by the bloodshed. Cloaked in black attire, she laid a white rose at the site of the attack on Tuesday morning.“Twelve people were among us yesterday and were happy about Christmas and the holidays,” Merkel said. “This is incomprehensible, this act that robbed them of their lives.”Addressing a nation gripped by anger and despair, Merkel encouraged Germans not to be afraid.“We don’t want to do without Christmas markets, without nice outings together,” she said. “We do not wish to let fear and angst take away our freedom to live.”The tragedy comes near the end of a year marred by similar violent assaults in Germany. Leaders and mourners around the world have joined in solidarity to commemorate the victims of the country’s worst attack in decades.“It’s terrible to see this scene,” said Berlin Mayor Michael Müller, who rushed to the site on Monday. “It’s exactly what we did not want to see in Berlin.”Hundreds of people joined Müller and Merkel at memorial services on Tuesday.Berlin illuminated its famous Brandenburg Gate with the colors of the German flag to honor the victims.U.S. President Barack Obama’s administration released a statement condemning the attack. “We send our thoughts and prayers to the families and loved ones of those killed, just as we wish a speedy recovery to all of those wounded,” it read. “ We also extend our heartfelt condolences to the people and Government of Germany. ... we stand together with Berlin in the fight against all those who target our way of life and threaten our societies.”Obama’s successor, President-elect Donald Trump, had a strongly worded reaction. “Our hearts and prayers are with the loved ones of the victims of today’s horrifying terror attack in Berlin,” a statement from Trump’s transition team read. “ISIS and other Islamist terrorists continually slaughter Christians in their communities and places of worship as part of their global jihad,” it continued, referring to the so-called Islamic State without evidence of the Berlin assailant’s motives or affiliations, or the victims’ religious backgrounds.French President François Hollande expressed his compassion and solidarity with Germany, Merkel and the families of the victims on Twitter. France, which has also endured several acts of terrorism this year, has intensified its security measures following the attack in Berlin.British Prime Minister Theresa May took to Twitter to share her condolences with Germans, as well as with those affected by the assassination of Turkey’s Russian ambassador, Andrey Karlov, on the same day. ”German people should know we are all with them tonight, praying for families of victims. Freedom shall prevail,” tweeted Kosovo President Hashim Thaçi.Love and support for those affected by the attack poured in via social media, with hashtags like #IchBinEinBerliner (I am a Berliner) and #StandWithBerlin flooding Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. While similar to other solidary-oriented hashtags like #JeSuisCharlie, “Ich bin ein Berliner” also is a famous line from a 1963 speech by then-U.S. President John F. Kennedy, in which he stressed American support for West Germany after the erection of the Berlin Wall."

OTTAWA, Ontario – An Inuit hamlet in Canada’s Arctic is hoping the country’s highest court will quash a permit for underwater oil and gas exploration off the coast of Baffin Island.On November 30, after a two-year legal battle, the Supreme Court of Canada heard the final legal challenge from the residents of Clyde River, located on the east coast of Baffin Island and home to about a thousand people.Clyde River residents rely on fishing and hunting for food and income. They fear that the seismic surveys, which involve sending sonic waves toward the ocean floor to detect underground oil and gas reserves, in Baffin Bay and Davis Strait will harm local marine mammals, including seals and narwhals, and disrupt migratory routes.Jerry Natanine, the former mayor of Clyde River who initiated the lawsuit, said the community is concerned the project will “have a devastating effect” on their hunting culture and traditional way of life.“If we should win, the effect it’s going to have and the power it’s going to give to the citizens of the country, we cannot really understand how big that is,” Natanine told Arctic Deeply a few days before the Supreme Court hearing.Legally, Clyde River’s case comes down to a principle known as the duty to consult.If successful, the Supreme Court’s decision, expected in a few months, could overturn some National Energy Board of Canada (NEB) approvals. It could also change the way Canada – and its representatives ­– consult with Indigenous peoples on resource development projects that could infringe on their rights.Aboriginal and treaty rights to hunt, fish and trap wildlife on traditional territory are laid out in section 35 of the Canadian constitution.The Crown has a legal duty to consult and accommodate when aboriginal title or rights have been asserted and may be adversely affected by a government activity, such as mining, forestry and oil and gas extraction.But the courts have interpreted the duty to consult in a variety of ways.A 2004 Supreme Court case specified that the duty to consult lies with the so-called “honor of the Crown,” the ethical underpinnings of the state’s commitments to its citizens. While some procedures can be delegated to third-parties, this obligation cannot. The case also described consultation as happening along a spectrum – from “deep consultation” to “lower levels of consultation” – depending on which aboriginal rights are at stake.According to Janna Promislow, associate professor in the Faculty of Law at Thompson Rivers University in British Columbia, legal scholars disagree on whether the Crown must be directly involved in the consultation process and whether third-party regulators, like the NEB, can carry out the duty.The NEB is a federal regulator that considers requests from companies to conduct oil and gas exploration activities in the Arctic and build pipelines and other energy projects.After consulting with the community of Clyde River, the NEB granted a five-year license in 2014 to a consortium of companies to conduct seismic testing in Baffin Bay and Davis Strait during the open-water season.The Clyde River case rests on whether a third party, in this case the NEB, can carry out the consultation in the place of the federal government.If the Supreme Court finds that it cannot, regulatory changes will be necessary, Promislow said.“I think our whole regulatory system does need reform to make sense of the duty to consult. We need more joint management. We need more land-use planning and things with Indigenous peoples as decision-makers,” she said.But if the court rules the NEB can carry out the duty, she said the regulator’s role would likely be clarified “to make sure that Indigenous concerns are addressed as part of our regulatory system over lands and resources.”NEB spokesperson Steven Rowe told Arctic Deeply the NEB does not comment on legal cases that are before the courts.On its website, the NEB states that its decisions take “aboriginal concerns into account.” Companies must provide information about consultations and details on a project’s potential impact on Indigenous rights. Indigenous groups may also submit concerns about proposed projects, it also says.In the Clyde River case, the NEB organized town-hall-style meetings from April 29 to May 2, 2013, in Pond Inlet, Clyde River, Qikiqtarjuaq and Iqaluit.But Natanine said that the residents’ questions about the impact of seismic blasts on marine life went unanswered during these meetings. Inuit groups asked for a delay in the decision so they could conduct an environmental assessment, but the NEB granted the license despite the request.“We were treated unfairly. The government didn’t hear our concerns,” said Natanine.In an emailed statement, Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada told Arctic Deeply the government is reviewing the NEB’s governance structure, role and mandate, “with particular focus on enhancing the participation of the public and Indigenous peoples in regulatory reviews.”Nader Hasan, the lawyer for Clyde River, said that what’s at stake – the potential loss of the Inuit right to fish and harvest and sustain their livelihoods – puts the onus on the Crown to deliver more meaningful consultation to the community.“We’re dealing with what the courts have called deep consultation, where a higher level of fairness is owed to the Indigenous peoples, [and] where access to an open public forum process is not enough,” Hasan told Arctic Deeply.The NEB has never authorized a license to drill for oil in the Davis Strait or Baffin Bay areas and there are currently no active licenses for offshore drilling in the Canadian Arctic.But oil and gas companies have expressed interest in exploring the resource-rich region. The Arctic may hold 30 percent of the world’s undiscovered natural gas reserves and 13 percent of its uncovered oil reserves, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.Hasan said he hoped the Supreme Court’s ruling will provide greater certainty over what “deep consultation” means, and tell Indigenous peoples what rights they’re entitled to when future projects are proposed.“Knowing what you’re entitled to will actually give Indigenous groups and leaders the tools with which to challenge future projects and future encroachments on their traditional territory and land,” he said.“No matter how the Supreme Court rules, it will provide guidance going forward for industry, for Indigenous peoples, [and] for governments on the rules of the game.”This article originally appeared on Arctic Deeply.

That attack was claimed by Islamic State.Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere had previously said there were indications that the incident in Berlin was an attack.Police said that the man found dead in the truck was a Polish citizen but added he was not in control of the vehicle. The nationality of the suspected driver, who fled the crash scene and was later arrested, was unclear, they said.German media cited local security sources as saying that there was evidence suggesting the arrested suspect was from Afghanistan or Pakistan and had entered Germany in February as a refugee.Berlin police are investigating leads that the truck had been stolen from a construction site in Poland. They have taken the truck for a forensic examination."

He has compiled more wins than anyone in Division I history.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58589b1a1800002d00e4398b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"With over 1,000 wins to his name, Duke basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski is the winningest coach in NCAA Division I history. He has won five national championships ― most recently in 2015 ― and is both an inductee of the Naismith Memorial and College Basketball Halls of Fame. And, at 69 years old, the West Point graduate is hardly slowing down either. Following a recent knee replacement surgery, this season Coach K has arguably his most talented team yet, with legitimate hopes of capturing a sixth title.Krzyzewski caught up with The Huffington Post to discuss guiding Team USA to three consecutive gold medals, the hardest part about keeping his program small and why recruiting today is more demanding than ever before.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity. You’ve joined forces with Hit Play, which promotes joint replacement surgery as a way to avoid living in constant pain. Just how bad and how much pain were you in before your hip replacement surgery? I’m not sure most fans understand you were really struggling.I knew that my left knee was bone-on-bone for a few years, but it was not symptomatic. My legs were strong, and for whatever reason I wasn’t having the pain. Then, during the season, my knee was literally starting to collapse a little bit, and I had to get a brace for it and wore the brace for seven, eight weeks. That first hip replacement 17 years ago taught me you don’t have to live with pain, you don’t have to live with a lack of mobility, you can get back to being normal, you just need to get this thing done. Have your vulnerabilities changed how you view players who get injured?Just because you play hard or get hurt as a player, that doesn’t mean you’re going to need to get joint replacement. A lot of this is just genetics.I’ve always felt like you have made a cognizant effort to evolve as a coach. Duke doesn’t strictly employ man-to-man defense anymore, for example. And your offense caters more to the personnel you’ve recruited. I think it’s a key for sustained success and sustained excellence ― to be a lifelong learner and also to be able to adapt to the changing cultures that the kids and the people that you have the honor to coach come from. I’ve been coaching for 42 years as a head coach, and you know, culture changes. What you teach and value ― trust, loyalty, teamwork, cooperation, hard work ― they stay the same. But the way you develop that within your group is different, same with methods of attack on offense and defense.The amount of time you have with a team ― how much can you get in within that period, how many older guys do you have to teach your system? With guys leaving early you don’t have that four-year-player all the time ― especially your best player. And then I’ve learned over the last 10 years coaching the U.S. Team that you adapt everyday in dealing with men and different egos and how to get them all under one ego. Just like in physical training: What do you do now compared to what you used to do, and what did you learn? How much of a challenge is it for you and Coach Capel to go after guys that could be one-and-done guys or two-year guys, when in the past you generally had more upperclassmen? Well, Jordan, to be quite frank with you, they’re the same guys except that they’re leaving now. Grant Hill, Christian Laettner, Bobby Hurley ― they may have been one-and-done if they were here 25 years later. And so, we really have gone after the same type of guys, guys who are really good players, really good students, good character. That hasn’t changed.It’s just that success as far as going into the NBA comes sooner for these guys now, so what we’ve had to adapt to is more recruiting year by year. I find that I’m recruiting more and more intensely than at any other time in my career, because of the frequency and the amount of work that goes into recruiting a youngster at that level.How much of your experience with Team USA has helped sustain the Duke program at an even higher level?I would say that success helps recruiting. In other words, if we weren’t successful in our program at Duke, we wouldn’t attract as many kids. If I coached the USA team, and LeBron James and Durant and Kobe and all those other guys said, “I hated playing for that guy,” that wouldn’t help us in recruiting. If we lost to Spain in Beijing when the score was a 2-point game, that wouldn’t help us in recruiting. But the fact is that we’ve done well. If you’re worthy of being asked to do something and have the courage to accept it, and the work ethic to make it good ― all three of those steps took place in order to have what some people think is a gift from somewhere.With all of that success collegiately and internationally, how do you maintain the intimacy in your program when everything is so big? How do you keep that family atmosphere with such tremendous exposure, because I picked up on that during my first game in Cameron.Well it’s a good question. First of all, it comes from people. The infrastructure of our program: It’s not my program, it’s our program. Then, the kids that we recruit are really good kids. When they’re put in this type of environment in a school as great as Duke, it helps us tremendously. They recognize they want to be a part of something bigger than them. And then what we do is we don’t think about what we’ve done, but we try to focus on what we’re doing. I don’t want a guy who might be a one-and-done thinking about going pro, just like I don’t want me thinking of retirement or thinking about what we did in Rio. Or what we did in 2015. Let’s all think about the same thing, about how this group can have an amazing experience. That can be a challenge, but it’s a challenge worth meeting and then beating.How prominent a role do world events play within the framework of your team, politics for example? Do you encourage players and coaches to have these types of conversations?Yeah, we talk about those things. Our guys are able to express those views, we don’t have any type of restrictions on social media, except for them to recognize that they’re not just them, they’re us. When you do say something or whatever it is, you’re part of our program and to understand that responsibility. We talk about it, whether it be HB2 or the flag situation that occurred earlier, we talk about all those things, because that’s the environment that they’re living, and we are very happy to hear their views. We don’t have an agenda or have to make a statement about everything. Duke always schedules as tough as anyone else in the country. You have discussed preparing for the tournament by using the schedule to your advantage. What we try to do in our non-conference scheduling is to schedule one of the top 10 schedules in the country, which we always have. But also put ourselves in situations that’ll be similar to the situations that we will have in March. Big games, big arenas, different times.

83,SPORTS,Mike Krzyzewski: 'I’m Recruiting More And More Intensely Than At Any Other Time In My Career',Jordan Schultz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mike-krzyzewski-im-recruiting-more-and-more-intensely-than-at-any-other-time-in-my-career_us_58570133e4b0b3ddfd8d49f1,Going inside the mind of the five-time national champion coach and three-time Olympic gold medalist head coach.,2016-12-20,Coach K talks to consensus First-Team All-American and future No. 3 overall NBA Draft pick Jahlil Okafor during the 2015 Final Four.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58589b601800002c00e4398c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"With over 1,000 wins to his name, Duke basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski is the winningest coach in NCAA Division I history. He has won five national championships ― most recently in 2015 ― and is both an inductee of the Naismith Memorial and College Basketball Halls of Fame. And, at 69 years old, the West Point graduate is hardly slowing down either. Following a recent knee replacement surgery, this season Coach K has arguably his most talented team yet, with legitimate hopes of capturing a sixth title.Krzyzewski caught up with The Huffington Post to discuss guiding Team USA to three consecutive gold medals, the hardest part about keeping his program small and why recruiting today is more demanding than ever before.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity. You’ve joined forces with Hit Play, which promotes joint replacement surgery as a way to avoid living in constant pain. Just how bad and how much pain were you in before your hip replacement surgery? I’m not sure most fans understand you were really struggling.I knew that my left knee was bone-on-bone for a few years, but it was not symptomatic. My legs were strong, and for whatever reason I wasn’t having the pain. Then, during the season, my knee was literally starting to collapse a little bit, and I had to get a brace for it and wore the brace for seven, eight weeks. That first hip replacement 17 years ago taught me you don’t have to live with pain, you don’t have to live with a lack of mobility, you can get back to being normal, you just need to get this thing done. Have your vulnerabilities changed how you view players who get injured?Just because you play hard or get hurt as a player, that doesn’t mean you’re going to need to get joint replacement. A lot of this is just genetics.I’ve always felt like you have made a cognizant effort to evolve as a coach. Duke doesn’t strictly employ man-to-man defense anymore, for example. And your offense caters more to the personnel you’ve recruited. I think it’s a key for sustained success and sustained excellence ― to be a lifelong learner and also to be able to adapt to the changing cultures that the kids and the people that you have the honor to coach come from. I’ve been coaching for 42 years as a head coach, and you know, culture changes. What you teach and value ― trust, loyalty, teamwork, cooperation, hard work ― they stay the same. But the way you develop that within your group is different, same with methods of attack on offense and defense.The amount of time you have with a team ― how much can you get in within that period, how many older guys do you have to teach your system? With guys leaving early you don’t have that four-year-player all the time ― especially your best player. And then I’ve learned over the last 10 years coaching the U.S. Team that you adapt everyday in dealing with men and different egos and how to get them all under one ego. Just like in physical training: What do you do now compared to what you used to do, and what did you learn? How much of a challenge is it for you and Coach Capel to go after guys that could be one-and-done guys or two-year guys, when in the past you generally had more upperclassmen? Well, Jordan, to be quite frank with you, they’re the same guys except that they’re leaving now. Grant Hill, Christian Laettner, Bobby Hurley ― they may have been one-and-done if they were here 25 years later. And so, we really have gone after the same type of guys, guys who are really good players, really good students, good character. That hasn’t changed.It’s just that success as far as going into the NBA comes sooner for these guys now, so what we’ve had to adapt to is more recruiting year by year. I find that I’m recruiting more and more intensely than at any other time in my career, because of the frequency and the amount of work that goes into recruiting a youngster at that level.How much of your experience with Team USA has helped sustain the Duke program at an even higher level?I would say that success helps recruiting. In other words, if we weren’t successful in our program at Duke, we wouldn’t attract as many kids. If I coached the USA team, and LeBron James and Durant and Kobe and all those other guys said, “I hated playing for that guy,” that wouldn’t help us in recruiting. If we lost to Spain in Beijing when the score was a 2-point game, that wouldn’t help us in recruiting. But the fact is that we’ve done well. If you’re worthy of being asked to do something and have the courage to accept it, and the work ethic to make it good ― all three of those steps took place in order to have what some people think is a gift from somewhere.With all of that success collegiately and internationally, how do you maintain the intimacy in your program when everything is so big? How do you keep that family atmosphere with such tremendous exposure, because I picked up on that during my first game in Cameron.Well it’s a good question. First of all, it comes from people. The infrastructure of our program: It’s not my program, it’s our program. Then, the kids that we recruit are really good kids. When they’re put in this type of environment in a school as great as Duke, it helps us tremendously. They recognize they want to be a part of something bigger than them. And then what we do is we don’t think about what we’ve done, but we try to focus on what we’re doing. I don’t want a guy who might be a one-and-done thinking about going pro, just like I don’t want me thinking of retirement or thinking about what we did in Rio. Or what we did in 2015. Let’s all think about the same thing, about how this group can have an amazing experience. That can be a challenge, but it’s a challenge worth meeting and then beating.How prominent a role do world events play within the framework of your team, politics for example? Do you encourage players and coaches to have these types of conversations?Yeah, we talk about those things. Our guys are able to express those views, we don’t have any type of restrictions on social media, except for them to recognize that they’re not just them, they’re us. When you do say something or whatever it is, you’re part of our program and to understand that responsibility. We talk about it, whether it be HB2 or the flag situation that occurred earlier, we talk about all those things, because that’s the environment that they’re living, and we are very happy to hear their views. We don’t have an agenda or have to make a statement about everything. Duke always schedules as tough as anyone else in the country. You have discussed preparing for the tournament by using the schedule to your advantage. What we try to do in our non-conference scheduling is to schedule one of the top 10 schedules in the country, which we always have. But also put ourselves in situations that’ll be similar to the situations that we will have in March. Big games, big arenas, different times. We’ve played two 9:30 games, then we have to travel back to campus and get there at 4 in the morning.In the NCAA Tournament, you’re going to be playing in front of neutral, huge crowds. You’re going to have games that start at noon, 10:15 at night, whatever, so we try to get our team ready for March, not so much get it ready for January.

The withdrawal includes 115 million acres in the Arctic and 3.8 million acres in the north and mid-Atlantic Ocean, according to the Interior Department.Interior Secretary Sally Jewell said in a statement that the president had taken a “bold action” that “will help build the resilience of these vital ecosystems, provide refuges for at-risk species, sustain commercial fisheries and subsistence traditions, and create natural laboratories for scientists to monitor and explore the impacts of climate change.”The permanent protections ― which are separate from the temporary bans announced as part of the Obama administration’s five-year oil and gas lease program ― rely on a provision of the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. The provision gives presidents the power to “from time to time, withdraw from disposition any of the unleased lands of the outer continental shelf.”Environmental organizations, including NextGen Climate, have urged Obama in recent months to use his power to safeguard these areas from future drilling, noting Trump’s “dangerous agenda.”NextGen Climate President Tom Steyer called Tuesday’s announcement “historic and heroic.”“As Donald Trump stacks his cabinet with Big Oil cronies and polluters, President Obama has acted to protect our oceans, our air and our climate for our coastal communities and future generations of Americans,” Steyer said in a statement. Of course, it is likely that Trump, who has called climate change “bullshit” and a “hoax,” will attempt to rescind such a ban. But as the White House official told reporters, there is no provision in the law providing for such a reversal.“No president has every acted to reverse an indefinite withdrawal,” the official said. “And we believe there is a strong legal basis that these withdrawals ... will go forward and will stand the test of time.”Stoking fear amongst the scientific community, Trump has said he would increase America’s production of coal, oil and natural gas, as well as do away with Obama administration regulations aimed at cutting greenhouse gas emissions. He has also pledged to pull the U.S. out of the historic Paris climate agreement and cut all federal spending for climate change research.In the waning months of his presidency, Obama has taken numerous actions to further cement his climate legacy, including outlining a path for climate change resiliency, formally joining the Paris climate pact and quadrupling the marine monument surrounding the remote northwestern Hawaiian Islands.Last month, the Interior Department moved to institute a temporary ban on drilling in the Arctic’s Beaufort and Chukchi seas between 2017 and 2022, thereby limiting offshore drilling to the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska’s Cook Inlet. Obama’s permanent withdrawal encompasses the entire U.S. portion of the Chukchi Sea and significant portions of the Beaufort Sea. It also covers 31 canyons in the Atlantic, stretching from New England to the Chesapeake Bay.As it did following last month’s Interior announcement, the American Petroleum Institute blasted Obama’s decision, saying it “ignores congressional intent, our national security, and vital, good-paying job opportunities.”“Fortunately, there is no such thing as a permanent ban, and we look forward to working with the new administration on fulfilling the will of American voters on energy production,” Erik Milito, the industry trade group’s director of upstream and industry operations, said in a statement.The White House sees things quite differently. And by acting alongside Canada, the White House official said, the U.S. has reinforced the partnership between the two countries.“The United States is not acting alone today,” the official said during the press call. “One of the principal arguments that people had made against the U.S. protecting its Arctic waters was perhaps all of that [oil and gas] activity would move into Canadian waters. And by acting jointly with Canada, I think we’ve sent a powerful signal.”In a June report, Greenpeace found that proposed expansion of oil and gas drilling in the Arctic and the Gulf of Mexico would result in climate-related social costs between $58.6 billion and $179.2 billion ― enough to potentially outweigh the economic benefits of selling the energy. The Interior Department noted in its release that the new ban does not affect existing oil and gas leases, only future ones, and does not encompass a 2.8-million-acre nearshore area of the Beaufort Sea that is potentially rich in oil and gas.The collective actions taken by the U.S. and Canada, the White House said in a statement, safeguard a “sensitive and unique ecosystem that is unlike any other region on earth.”“They reflect the scientific assessment that, even with the high safety standards that both our countries have put in place, the risks of an oil spill in this region are significant and our ability to clean up from a spill in the region’s harsh conditions is limited,” it said.

86,POLITICS,Here's How Trump Could Try To Stop Companies From Offshoring Jobs,Daniel Marans and Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-offshoring-jobs_us_58599fdee4b0de3a08f34da0,"Without calling every one of them personally, that is.",2016-12-20,"President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence take a tour of Carrier Corporation in Indianapolis, Indiana, on Dec. 1, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5859a20b1600002500bdee13.jpeg?cache=26k8DV0cYN&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President-elect Donald Trump says he’ll personally call every company in America that plans to ship jobs overseas and ask them to reconsider.But there are ways to stop American companies from offshoring jobs that don’t involve the U.S. president spending hours on the phone. After all, hundreds of companies offshore jobs every year ― and the president only has so much time. Trump could use the power of the executive branch to protect domestic manufacturing and make it more competitive over the long term. Regardless of whether Trump’s threat to punish offshoring companies with a 35-percent tariff on imports they ship back to the U.S. is practical, the president indeed has far-reaching power to overturn existing U.S. trade practices.Trump “will possess ample statutory powers he needs to restrict all forms of international commerce, including merchandise and service trade, capital flows, and private remittances,” Gary Hufbauer, a lawyer and economist with the Peterson Institute for International Economics, wrote in November. “He can slap restrictions without congressional say-so and with little fear of judicial reversals.” Federal procurement is one way Trump could boost domestic manufacturing with relative ease. Congress requires the federal government to favor American-made products when it buys things. But in recent decades, the U.S. has exempted goods produced in countries with which the U.S. has trade agreements from so-called Buy America provisions. As a result, rather than using its purchasing power to give preferential treatment to goods produced domestically, the federal government treats goods manufactured in countries like Mexico and China the same as if they were American-made products. Because those elements of trade agreements are enacted through regulatory waivers, Trump can simply scrap the waivers, according to Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen’s Global Trade Watch.“Trump, were he so inclined, could guarantee a lot more purchase of U.S. manufactured goods ― steel, glass, but also cars, computers, phone systems et cetera ― by getting rid of that waiver. And Congress does not really have anything to do about it,” Wallach said.Foreign countries would respond by filing legal challenges against the U.S. for violating the agreements, according to Wallach, but those cases take roughly three years to get decided. In the meantime, the U.S. could renegotiate the agreements themselves so the country would not be in violation, she argued. Of course, successfully raising barriers to foreign imports is one thing ― and achieving the goal of restoring domestic jobs is another entirely.Economists generally think that if Trump hikes tariffs on imported goods, other countries will hike tariffs on American exports, possibly resulting in a trade war that could lead to higher prices, lost jobs, and even a recession. Wallach and other trade-deal skeptics are far less concerned that restricting trade would provoke a vicious cycle of retaliation with other countries. Foreign nations might agree to renegotiate on terms more favorable to the U.S. for fear of losing access to the American consumer market entirely, Wallach said ― a threat she said Trump could credibly hold over them. The U.S. has particularly strong leverage over China, Scott Paul, executive director of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, claimed in a New York Times op-ed this month.“China has a big incentive to get along with the United States: America is the destination for nearly one in five Chinese exports, making us a market China can’t afford to lose,” Paul wrote. “American exports to China, meanwhile, account for less than 1 percent of our gross domestic product.”There are other ideas, however, that may entail less risk. Democrats in the U.S. Senate ― several of whom happen to be up for election next cycle in rust-belt states carried by Trump ― have been pushing several policy proposals designed to make it less profitable for an American firm to lay off workers and shift production to a country like Mexico, where wages are lower. President Barack Obama, particularly during his 2012 re-election, repeatedly bashed Republicans for supporting “tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas.” There is no tax break specifically for offshoring, but companies can deduct moving expenses from their tax liability, and those expenses can be related to shifting production to another country. This year, Senate Democrats proposed pairing an elimination of the supposed offshoring tax break with a tax credit that would reward companies for shifting jobs to the U.S. ― something they’ve proposed before. Tax experts have been skeptical as to whether such a measure would actually save jobs. Another Democratic proposal would require the federal government to consider whether a company is offshoring jobs when it awards federal contracts ― an idea Democrats and Trump may agree on. Staying on the government’s good side was a factor in Carrier Corp.’s decision to keep its Indiana factory open after Trump bad-mouthed the company’s offshoring plans during the campaign. (The firm’s parent company, a major federal contractor, got a modest tax break from the state of Indiana.) Some of these proposals are “sticks” ― ways of making offshoring and importing foreign-made goods less cost-effective. But many manufacturing proponents argue that investing in “carrots” that make domestic production more attractive to companies is a surer long-term method for restoring the country’s manufacturing base.  Germany is often cited by experts as a model for a developed democracy with a strong manufacturing sector and skilled, high-paying jobs associated with it.Nearly 20 percent of German jobs come from manufacturing, compared with about 10 percent in the United States. A crucial component of Germany’s manufacturing prowess is its apprenticeship system, which trains high school students in technical trades from age 14 onward, according to Stephen Silvia, an expert in German industrial policy at American University. Half the students’ time is spent learning in the classroom, and half is spent training with craftsmen at a company until they graduate high school, according to Silvia. “In terms of non-college bound, native-born Germans, they have done a better job providing education that can lead to a person earning a better standard of living and that is around the apprenticeship system,” Silvia said. Other German manufacturing advantages include sophisticated efforts by business groups to promote exports and the government’s heavy investment in research and development, Silvia noted.Replicating this in the U.S. would be an uphill climb due to Americans’ deep-seated aversion to federal educational mandates, and close coordination between industry and government.An Obama administration attempt to cultivate German-style apprenticeships, for example, partnered with community colleges, which reach young people at an older age than Germany’s high school-based programs. Expanding public research funding and coordination with industry to ensure the relevance of that research “would be one of the best things” the Trump administration can do to promote manufacturing over the long term, Silvia said.“Having institutions where their job is to engage in basic research that generally may not directly have an obvious private sector use, but provides the basic foundation of private research and expands the size of your R&D labor force ... is an important piece. That way you are not completely unanchored in the interests of business,” Silvia said."

She was terminated for “unbecoming” conduct in July, according to a copy of the decision obtained by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.According to the suit, Cotriss said the flag, which was a gift, had been flying for over a year outside her home in Woodstock, Georgia, about 30 miles north of Atlanta, “without causing any problems.”“She was displaying her pride in her Southern heritage and honoring her recently deceased husband,” the suit says.However, a man who lived near Cotriss complained to her department about the flag. Her attorney says that rather than asking Cotriss to take it down, the department “just fired her.”“It’s interesting because if they simply said, ‘Hey Silvia, you need to take down that flag because we received a complaint,’ she would have complied,” Cotriss’ attorney, David Ates, told The Huffington Post Monday. “I think they wanted to get rid of her for other reasons. She’s an older lady, she was out on medical leave for some time, she had trouble passing a fitness test.”Cotriss, a 20-year veteran of the police department, claimed to The Associated Press in July that she did not know some people find the flag offensive.“If I knew it offended someone, my friends, my family, I wouldn’t do it,” she said.The case recently made national news after Kirk Lyons, who the Southern Poverty Law Center describes as a “white supremacist lawyer,” announced on Friday that he would be helping fight Cotriss’ case with his group, the Southern Legal Resource Center.Ates said Monday that he has since cut ties with Lyons, and that he and Cotriss were not aware of Lyons’ background and the allegations against him when they first accepted his help.“We thought [SLRC was] just a Southern heritage group and like the Sons of the Confederate Veterans,” Ates said.“When this news broke last week, I started getting calls that maybe Mr. Lyons holds some extremist views,” Ates said. “And that was news to me and my client.”Lyons said he reached out and offered to help Cotriss because he specializes in defending Southern and Confederate heritage. As for the other allegations against him from the SPLC, which tracks hate groups, Lyons denies being a racist.“We are not a right-wing group, we are not a hate group and I am not a white supremacist lawyer,” he told HuffPost Tuesday.According to the SPLC, Lyons has been affiliated with Ku Klux Klan and white supremacist leaders since the 1980s. In addition to representing and defending these people, the SPLC accuses Lyons of marrying his wife in a neo-Nazi Aryan Nations compound and marching with Klansmen in a Tennessee parade in 1989.Lyons said he did indeed have his wedding in the compound, but claimed it was because his wife’s parents’ church was there. He also acknowledged that he was at the Klan parade, but said it was so he could protect the First Amendment rights of those marching.“I gave instructions,” he said. “I actually pulled people out of jail that were arrested just because they chose to participate.”He also didn’t deny defending white supremacists in court.“I don’t know if I believed everything these guys believe... but it’s my job to represent people who are hated, whose beliefs are unpopular. That is my duty as a lawyer,” he said. “It shouldn’t matter whatever my background is if I am willing to right a wrong.”Ates said he doesn’t know whether the allegations against Lyons are true. If they’re not, he said, “I feel bad for him.”Regardless, Ates said Lyons is no longer involved in Cotriss’ case.“His involvement is distracting from Ms. Cotriss’ case and interest,” he told HuffPost. “We can’t have everybody taking their eye off the ball.”Lyons said he hopes to rejoin the case at some point.“We’re getting a timeout because things need to die down, and they will,” he said. “She deserves a fair shake and people in Atlanta not thinking that Godzilla is her attorney.”“Whether I’m on the case or not,” he said, “I will do whatever I can to help Sergeant Cotriss.”The Roswell Police Department referred questions Monday to the city of Roswell, which declined to comment, citing the pending litigation.Cotriss’ lawsuit seeks reinstatement of her position or 10 years of pay and benefits."
