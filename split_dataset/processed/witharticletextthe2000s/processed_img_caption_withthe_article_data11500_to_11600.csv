While many marked Wednesday’s 75th anniversary by remembering the more than 2,300 U.S. servicemen killed in battle on Dec. 7, 1941, Gingrich took a different approach.Here are the tweets: Gingrich, who has co-authored two novels based on the events surrounding the attack, drew sharp replies on Twitter: "

During a segment on CNN on Wednesday, author and political commentator Marc Lamont Hill shared that he was “baffled” that another pundit appearing on the show thought that Carson’s leadership skills and accomplishments as a surgeon make him a fit candidate. “Being a neurosurgeon doesn’t make you qualified to be the head of HUD,” Lamont said. “Leadership skills are not transferrable, you know what I mean. Like Ghostface Killah’s the leader of Wu-Tang Clan, right? LeBron James is the leader of Cleveland Cavaliers. It doesn’t mean they should be the leader of Housing and Urban Development.”Lamont also mentioned that Carson’s team admitted that he didn’t have experience in government and didn’t know how to run an office.“So if he says that himself, why do you choose him to be the leader of one of the most significant departments in America?” Lamont asked.We’re still trying to figure that out ourselves, Marc.Watch the full video below."

4,THE WORLDPOST,Trade Unions Challenge FIFA And Qatar World Cup In Swiss Court,"James M. Dorsey, ContributorS. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, Senior fellow",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trade-unions-challenge-fifa-and-qatar-world-cup-in_us_584979fee4b0afda6e983e79,Two Bangladeshi and a Dutch trade union have sued FIFA in a Swiss court in legal proceedings that challenge the world soccer,2016-12-08,"Workers test soil as they grow grass for Qatar's 2022 World Cup, at an experimental facility in Doha, Qatar November 29, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/584abf821c00002d000eaad4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Two Bangladeshi and a Dutch trade union have sued FIFA in a Swiss court in legal proceedings that challenge the world soccer body’s awarding to Qatar of the 2022 World Cup because of the Gulf state’s controversial labour regime. The case could call into question group’s status as a non-profit and, if successful, open the door to a wave of claims against FIFA as well as Qatar and other Gulf states who employ millions of migrant workers.The legal proceedings come at a crucial moment in efforts by trade unions and human rights groups to work with Qatar on reforming its kafala or labour sponsorship system that puts workers at the mercy of their employers.Those efforts, a unique undertaking in a part of the world in which governments by and large refuse to engage and repress or bar their critics, have already produced initial results. The question is how far Qatar intends to push ahead with reform and to what degree it will feel the need to do so in a world in which the rise of populism has pushed human and other rights onto the backburner.Trade unions and human rights argue that Qatar since winning World Cup hosting rights six years ago has had sufficient time to bring its labour system in line with international standards and that its moves so far fall short of that.A key milestone alongside the trade unions’ legal action and a separate Swiss judicial inquiry into the integrity of the Qatari World Cup bid is a looming deadline set by the International Labour Organization (ILO) for Qatar to act on promises of reform that it has made.The ILO warned last March that it would establish a Commission of Inquiry if Qatar failed to act within a year. Such commissions are among the ILO’s most powerful tools to ensure compliance with international treaties. The UN body has only established 13 such commissions in its century-long history. The last such commission was created in 2010 to force Zimbabwe to live up to its obligations.The Netherlands Trade Union Confederation (FNV), supported by the Bangladesh Free Trade Union Congress (BFTUC) and the Bangladesh Building and Wood Workers Federation (BBWWF), filed their complaint against FIFA on behalf of a Bangladeshi migrant worker, Nadim Sharaful Alam.Mr. Alam was forced as is the norm in recruitment for Qatar to pay $4,300 to a recruitment agency in violation of Qatari law and FIFA standards that stipulate that employers should shoulder the cost of hiring. To raise the money, Mr. Alam had to mortgage land he owned, according to FNV lawyer Liesbeth Zegveld. Mr. Alam is also demanding compensation for being the victim of “modern slavery,” Ms. Zegveld said.The FNV said in a statement that it wanted the court to rule that “FIFA acted wrongfully by selecting Qatar for the World Cup 2022 without demanding the assurance that Qatar observes fundamental human and labour rights of migrant construction workers, including the abolition of the kafala system.” FIFA is a Swiss incorporated legal entity.The trade unions’ further demand that the court order FIFA to ensure that in the run-up to the World Cup workers’ rights are safeguarded by pressuring the Gulf state to enact and implement adequate and effective labour reforms takes on added significance following the group’s decision to take over responsibility for preparations of World Cups starting with the Qatar tournament.A Swiss government-sponsored unit of the Paris-based Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which groups 34 of the world’s richest countries, last year defined FIFA as a multi-national rather than a non-profit that was bound by the OECD’s guidelines. The decision meant that the soccer group would be responsible for upholding of the human and labour rights of workers employed in Qatar on World Cup-related projects. A court ruling upholding that principle would reinforce FIFA’s status as a business rather than a non-governmental organization.FIFA has repeatedly said that it was “fully committed to do its utmost to ensure that human rights are respected on all FIFA World Cup sites and operations and services directly related to the FIFA World Cup.” FIFA has recently included provisions for labour standards in World Cup contracts that kick in with the 2026 tournament.The decision to take on responsibility for World Cups means that FIFA no longer can hide behind assertions that it has no legal authority to impose its will on host countries. In a letter to Ms. Zegveld and the trade unions’ Swiss lawyers date 16 October 2016, FIFA Deputy Secretary General Marco Villiger asserted however that “FIFA refutes any and all assertions…regarding FIFA’s wrongful conduct and liability for human rights violations taking place in Qatar.” Ms. Zegveld noted that FIFA had refrained from denying the violations themselves.A recent survey of construction companies involved in World Cup-related infrastructure projects in Qatar called into question whether the Gulf state and FIFA were doing all they could do to enforce international labour standards.Less than a quarter of the 100 companies approached for the survey by the Business & Human Rights Resource Centre deemed it appropriate to respond. Less than 40 percent publicly expressed a commitment to human rights and only 17 percent referred to international standards. Only three companies publicly acknowledged rights of migrant workers.A human rights researcher with extensive experience in studying recruitment of migrant labour in Asia said the system was controlled by an international crime syndicate that benefitted from collusion between corrupt senior government officials, company executives, and recruitment agencies that cooperated across national borders at the expense of millions of unskilled workers. “Billions of dollars are involved, all off the books, not taxed that come from migrant workers,” the researcher said.A trade union court victory could open the door to an avalanche of cases by migrant workers demanding compensation for illegal recruitment practices as well as being victims of a system that curtails freedom of contract as well as basic human freedoms and workers’ rights. Those cases could target not only FIFA but also Qatar and other Gulf states that operate a kafala system. “This could just be the beginning,” said a trade union activist.Dr. James M. Dorsey is a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, co-director of the University of Würzburg’s Institute for Fan Culture, and the author of The Turbulent World of Middle East Soccer blog, a recently published book with the same title, and also just published Comparative Political Transitions between Southeast Asia and the Middle East and North Africa, co-authored with Dr. Teresita Cruz-Del Rosario."

Nick Rathod, executive director of the State Innovation Exchange, or SiX, started the conference with a statement meant to move the 400-plus state legislators in attendance beyond anger and blame and toward action to thwart the Republican agenda.“I’ve been hearing lots of theories,” Rathod said. “It was racism. Progressives ignored the white working class. People are dumb. It’s the millennials’ fault. Secretary Clinton was a flawed candidate. It was the FBI. It was the Russians. It was because of the electoral college. It was everyone’s fault but our own.”The epic failure of the Democratic Party in 2016 was a long time coming, according to Rathod. State legislators in the room know this best, he said, because before Trump won the White House, Republicans swept statehouses, governorships and other statewide offices across the country. “All of you have seen the writing on the wall. It’s been in the making for nearly a generation, and progressives have basically been asleep at the wheel.”On the other hand, Media Matters founder David Brock, who spoke next, had not gotten to acceptance yet. While promising resources to help SiX and state legislative elections and calling for an independent audit of Democrats’ failure, Brock declared that he was still stuck in the anger stage of grief. He then proceeded to run through the laundry list of blame: It was the Russians, FBI Director James Comey, the media, fake news, millennials and racists. This would be the last recitation of blame for the rest of the conference.Instead, the speakers and the state legislators in attendance showed their resolute desire to retain the gains of the Barack Obama years, to fight back against the Trump administration, go on offense in states they control and win back the states that they don’t.Democratic House Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) declared her support for a focus on state legislative elections ahead of the next round of redistricting as a priority. She also previewed how congressional Democrats will fight back in Washington. She compared the situation to when President George W. Bush won reelection and Republicans gained seats in the House and Senate. As congressional Democrats used Bush’s Social Security privatization as their unifying opposition issue then, they will use the proposal to privatize and voucherize Medicare to organize opposition to Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.).Former Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. announced that he would be the chairman of a new organization called the National Democratic Redistricting Committee. This would be a central hub to support state legislative campaigns to win back statehouses to regain the power to draw district maps, manage legal strategies in states controlled by Republicans and to oppose gerrymandering. He hinted that this effort may be joined by Obama when he leaves the White House.Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), meanwhile, drew clear lines on the values that Democrats should and do stand for. Those values run from the belief that “no one in America should work full time and live in poverty” to the conviction that “this is the time for progressives to say loudly and clearly there is no place for bigotry in the United States of America.”In general, the often convoluted debate about whether Democrats should speak to economic concerns as opposed to so-called identity politics was not taken on at the conference. Instead, panelists and speakers noted that there was no way to separate the issues of racism, sexism and other bigotries from the economic realm.“For me, economic justice is racial justice,” said Rashida Tlaib, a former Michigan state representative. She noted that when sports teams ask cities and states for tax breaks to build their stadiums, that comes out of money that could be directed to classrooms or to help improve black and brown communities.Dorian Warren, fellow at the liberal Roosevelt Institute, noted that racism stacks the deck against the economic opportunities for minority communities. Further, every progressive economic program helps minority communities. He urged the state legislators attending the conference to make sure that they fight back against any effort by state-level Republicans or congressional Republicans to impose new work requirements for social and health benefits.“Please resist the work requirements,” Warren said. “Resist that at all cost.”Rev. William Barber, head of the North Carolina NAACP, simply said, “If someone asks you, ‘Is it race or class?’ you just say, ‘It is.’”But, for the most part, the discussion and energy of the conference was focused on ensuring that Democrats at the state level were not going to be abandoned by the national party. SiX was founded specifically to be a part of a new infrastructure to support Democrats at the state level.Rathod explained to The Huffington Post that Republicans have built up a large infrastructure to not only elect party members up and down state ballots but also to provide them with a legislative agenda and intellectual support. There is the Republican State Leadership Committee, the American Legislative Exchange Council, the Franklin Center, State Policy Network and the Koch brothers’ Americans for Prosperity. If Democrats want to have any chance of countering Trump and rebuilding the party, they will need to do it from the bottom up, he argues.“The problem that progressives have had is that we have spent way too much time focused on Washington,” Rathod said. “So, that’s trying to get big massive bills passed in D.C. and then trying to educate everyone on the back end on why that’s a noble or good thing. What we haven’t done as well with is organizing locally, building our presence locally, developing and creating policies that speak to communities where they’re at and then talking about those policies in a way that makes sense to those communities.”For Rathod and the state legislators in attendance, this is the necessary final step to move beyond grief."

The panel of judges on Michigan’s Court of Appeals accepted Schuette’s and Trump’s arguments that Stein, who came in a distant fourth place in Michigan, was not an “aggrieved” party with standing to challenge the election results.At the same time, the judges appeared to acknowledge that their order would not take effect in light of Goldsmith’s original ruling, the Detroit Free Press reported.The challenge to the recount will now head back to Goldsmith.Although Stein insists her crowdfunded recount efforts aim merely to authenticate the vote, given the prospect of foreign hacking and other tampering, she has chosen to seek recounts in three closely fought states ― Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin ― that together cost Hillary Clinton the election. That choice has stoked speculation that Stein is seeking to ingratiate herself with Democrats. If Stein’s efforts fail decisively in any one of the three states, the chances for overturning Trump’s victory disappear.A recount in Wisconsin that began Thursday continued on Tuesday after a federal judge declined a request by a Trump voter and two super PACs to halt the recount.In order to prompt a recount in Pennsylvania, Stein is suing the state in federal court.

But she became a victim of this violence herself on Wednesday, when a cab driver threatened to rip off her hijab and called her “ISIS.” The Minnesota state representative-elect described what happened as she left a series of meetings at the White House as “the most hateful, derogatory, islamophobic, sexist taunts and threats I have ever experienced” on Facebook Wednesday afternoon.Omar, who escaped the cab shaken but physically unscathed, told the Minnesota Star Tribune she plans to continue focusing on her scheduled conferences and meetings in Washington D.C., although she is still concerned about her safety.“I plan to report once I am back home safe in Minneapolis,” Omar told the Star Tribune. “He knows the hotel I am staying at and [I] don’t feel safe enough to say anything at the moment.”The incident is part of the growing wave of attacks against Muslims that have occurred throughout the 2016 presidential campaign, some apparently inspired by President-elect Donald Trump’s rhetoric. Some of the attackers have mentioned Trump or chanted his name during assaults. Muslim women have been among the most frequently targeted, especially those who visibly practice their faith by wearing hijabs or other religious head coverings.Omar, who is 34 years old and a mother of three, was born in Somalia and lived in a Kenyan refugee camp for four years before immigrating to the United States at the age of 12. She ran on a progressive platform, prioritizing affordable college, economic equality, criminal justice reform and clean energy in her campaign that defeated longtime incumbent Phyllis Khan.America “is the land of liberty and justice for all, but we have to work for it,” Omar told The Huffington Post in October. “Our democracy is great, but it’s fragile. It’s come through a lot of progress, and we need to continue that progress to make it actually ‘justice for all.’”The Huffington Post is documenting the rising wave of anti-Muslim bigotry and violence in America.

That plan seems to satisfy most Americans, a new Bloomberg poll indicates. By and large, Americans say it’s necessary for Trump to choose between being president and being a businessman. But 69 percent think asking him to sell his businesses goes too far.Only 26 percent of those surveyed think he needs to sell his companies to eliminate a conflict of interest. Trump is expected to announce details on how he plans to separate his business dealings from his job as president on Dec. 15. According to The Washington Post, Trump owns or has a leadership role in 500 companies. Thirty percent of those companies have conducted business in 25 countries or more, CNN found. Thus far he has indicated that he may transfer the company operations to his oldest children, Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric. All three are also among those leading his presidential transition team. Ethics experts have expressed concern that transferring power to his kids is not enough and have called for Trump to sell his businesses in order to eliminate any conflict of interest that could arise. Federal law does not require Trump to sell his companies. But under guidance from the Office of Legal Counsel, presidents historically have abided by the spirit of the Constitution’s Emoluments Clause, which exists to protect elected officials from influence by foreign governments. Short of an actual lawsuit to enforce the clause, ethics experts have said the only way to punish presidents who violate it would be impeachment.Bloomberg surveyed 999 Americans via live interviewers who reached respondents on landlines and cellphones Dec. 2-5.

Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) gave her farewell address on the Senate floor Wednesday morning, reflecting on her 24 years in the chamber and giving a special mention to a woman who helped her get there. “I also need to pay tribute to Anita Hill, because without her, I never would have been elected to the Senate. Anita Hill courageously told her story to the all-male U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, breaking the silence on this painful issue,” Boxer said, in reference to the law professor testifying that Clarence Thomas, then a Supreme Court nominee, had sexually harassed her.“In addition, people saw there were only two women in the Senate,” she continued.“Anita Hill, you showed us all that we must never be afraid to take on the powerful. It certainly isn’t easy. But if you learn to be tough in the right way, you can find the sweet spot, even in this atmosphere where the parties have grown so far apart.”Boxer was one of three women elected to the Senate in 1992, along with Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Carol Moseley Braun (D-Ill.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.). They joined fellow Democrat Barbara Mikulski from Maryland and Republican Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas, who were already in the Senate. It was dubbed the “Year of the Woman” for the historic gains. Hill’s testimony before the all-male Senate Judiciary Committee was a wake-up call to women around the country about the lack of representation they had in Congress. “It electrified the country ― I don’t think there’s any question about it,” Rep. Louise Slaughter (D-N.Y.) told The Huffington Post in the summer. Women watched Hill face a hostile panel of all white men, many of whom seemed unable to understand why what Hill said she faced from Thomas ― who was eventually approved by the Senate ― was such a serious issue. Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) may have summed up the reaction on the Hill best when he reportedly declared, “If that’s sexual harassment, half the senators on Capitol Hill could be accused.”EMILY’s List Founder Ellen Malcolm said that no one had ever discussed sexual harassment until then. “So it was like ‘Mad Men,’” she said. “The behavior in the workplace ― men had one set of rules, and women had to cope. And women would have all these strategies to deal with it and never could talk about it. It was a forbidden subject. So Anita Hill basically opened pandora’s box and said, this behavior was inappropriate. And men had a very different perspective on what was appropriate workplace behavior than women.” Moseley Braun and Feinstein were named to the Judiciary Committee, but not without a misstep first by then-committee chair Sen. Joe Biden (D-Del.), who hand-delivered a dozen red roses to Boxer with the note, “Welcome to the Senate Judiciary Committee.” News reports at the time described the moment in highly gendered language ― that Biden had tried to “woo” Boxer but was “scorned,” and that he was “going courting” while the new senators were “playing hard to get.” Both Boxer and Mikulski are retiring after the end of this session. Feinstein will be the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee in the new year, the first woman to ever hold that job."
11,POLITICS,Democrats See Medicare Fight As Donald Trump’s Achilles Heel,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/medicare-donald-trump_us_58483c8de4b0d0df18375293,"Welcome to the ""war on seniors.""",2016-12-07,"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) spoke at a ""Hands Off Medicare"" press conference on Wednesday. He challenged President-elect Donald Trump to keep his promise not to cut Medicare.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58483cdf1800002d00e41608.jpeg?cache=B4X3zZXHiQ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Top Democrats spoke at a Wednesday press conference on Capitol Hill to warn President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican Congress against privatizing Medicare.It is not yet clear whether Trump has the same appetite as House Republicans to take on transforming the massive health care program for seniors and people with disabilities. But Democrats are not waiting for him ― or their congressional colleagues ― to make the first move, and vowed on Wednesday to hang any benefit cuts around the candidate’s neck like a millstone.And Democrats have a major advantage: Top Republicans like House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) are eager to turn Medicare into a voucher, but Trump ran on protecting, not cutting, the program.Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), speaking alongside incoming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and three other House Democrats, wielded Trump’s words against him. “Let me begin with a quote made by a Republican candidate for president ― a candidate who reached out to working people and who reached out to senior citizens ―and during the campaign this is what that Republican candidate said. He said: ‘I am not going to cut Social Security like every other Republican. And I am not going cut Medicare or Medicaid. Every other Republican is going to cut them’ ― end of quote,” Sanders said.“Mr. Trump, we are going to hold you accountable!” he continued, drawing applause from the dozen or so activists in attendance.The press conference was sponsored by Social Security Works, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, the Alliance for Retired Americans and several labor unions and other advocacy groups. The organizations solicited more than 1 million petition signatures from activists demanding that Trump, Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) keep Medicare intact. The signatures were piled into boxes that flanked the speakers and a contingent of the activists subsequently hand-delivered them to Ryan and McConnell after the event.Ryan has discussed his interest in using legislation that would repeal Obamacare to transform Medicare as well. He has falsely claimed that the reform law hurt Medicare’s finances, when it actually extended its solvency.For years, Ryan has backed plans to transform Medicare from a government-provided insurance plan to a flat voucher with that seniors would have to purchase their own insurance. Many health care experts warn that the voucher plan could endanger traditional Medicare as private plans lure healthier, more affluent seniors away. They also warn that the voucher would almost certainly fail to keep pace with the cost of health care.Senate Republicans, wary of Medicare’s popularity, have already signaled they are less than enthusiastic about the idea.Trump has not spoken on the matter since the election. However, Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), his nominee for Health and Human Services secretary, is an ardent supporter of voucherizing Medicare ― which some progressive advocates see as a sign that the president-elect may be yielding to Republican conservatives on health care issues.Wednesday’s press conference was only partly an attempt to scare Republicans away from touching Medicare, however. It was first and foremost an opportunity for Democrats, who are still struggling with how to counter Trump’s economic populism, to demonstrate their bona fides as champions of working Americans. “Republicans here in Washington are gearing up for a war on seniors ― and they shall not, they must not, prevail,” Schumer said. At one point, he feigned mercy on Republicans.“Democrats will not let them win this fight,” he said. “I say to my Republican colleagues: Turn back, because we will fight you on this tooth and nail. We will win, you will lose.”Schumer promised that Price, in particular, would face tough questioning during his confirmation hearing.  Schumer and several of the other lawmakers expressed confidence that if Republicans took on Medicare it would be a replay of 2004 and 2005, when congressional Democrats defeated then-President George W. Bush’s plan to privatize Social Security. The political win helped Democrats regain control the House of Representatives and Senate in the 2006 midterms. Although messing with Medicare, an extremely popular universal program, is politically radioactive, block-granting Medicaid and repealing Obamacare may prove less controversial for Republicans.Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) acknowledged as much.“The tip of the spear is really Medicare, because it is ubiquitous and so many families and Americans really get it,” she said.But she suggested cutting Medicaid would be more difficult than it seems as well, noting that many seniors depend on it for their long-term care services. “It’s going to be very, very hard to cut these programs,” Schakowsky concluded.This article has been updated with information about petition signatures.

12,POLITICS,Keith Ellison Will Resign House Seat If Elected DNC Chair,Zach Carter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/keith-ellison-dnc-chair_us_5848406ae4b08c82e8892898,The DNC race shifts to a debate over economic populism.,2016-12-07,"""The Democratic Party must be the party that delivers for working people,"" Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) said on Tuesday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58484168120000dd00eee036.jpeg?cache=g15QsMteFr&ops=crop_331_274_2554_1394%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) said Tuesday he will step down from his seat in Congress if Democrats elect him head of the party.“In order to further their commitment and maximize my effectiveness, I have decided to resign as a member of Congress if I win the election for DNC chair,” Ellison said in a statement. “Whoever wins the DNC chair race faces a lot of work, travel, planning and resource raising. I will be ‘all-in’ to meet the challenge.”Ellison has quickly racked up a series of key endorsements in the race. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and his successor Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) are behind Ellison, as are populist champions Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), along with more than 100 Democratic lawmakers. President Barack Obama, meanwhile, has indicated he would like to see either Labor Secretary Thomas Perez or former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm get the job, while Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.) is promoting South Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Jaime Harrison, a former Capitol Hill staffer and corporate lobbyist. Some Democrats backing other candidates have objected that Ellison’s job in Congress will distract him from important work as the party tries to rebuild after a devastating 2016 election. Democrats widely view the recent tenure of Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) as DNC chair as a debacle, in part for her dual role as congresswoman and party head. By offering to resign, Ellison hopes to focus the DNC chair race on questions of economic policy and party organization. “At this point, the Democratic Party must be the party that delivers for working people,” Ellison said Tuesday. “We can do that by meeting folks where they are, looking them in the eye, treating them with respect, and working to solve their problems. For me, that means a chair with only one full time commitment.” Ellison currently occupies what may be the safest House seat for Democrats in the country. He has been elected by a margin of at least 40 percentage points in every contest since first winning the district in 2006 (that year, his margin was a comfortable 35 percentage points). Ellison was a prominent supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) during the Democratic presidential primary, and the contest to head the DNC is serving as a proxy battle over economic populism. In his DNC policy platform, Ellison calls for a new focus on small-dollar donations instead of big corporate checks, and a renewed emphasis on state and local parties to recruit candidates and develop voter outreach. Both measures would shift the balance of power in the party away from D.C. insiders.Ellison, who would be the first Muslim to head the Democratic Party, is also facing a smear campaign involving, among others, pundit Steven Emerson, whom the Southern Poverty Law Center lists as an anti-Muslim extremist.

Those rollbacks, of a regulation seeking to grant more workers overtime pay, for example ― something that would affect more women than men ― seem “antithetical” to Donald Trump’s agenda to raise the pay and prospects of the nation’s workers, she said. It’s also unclear if Trump will roll back a separate initiative set to begin in 2018 that would require companies to report data on gender, race and pay.Certainly, Obama had hoped to pass on the equal pay mantle to an administration just as ― if not more ― committed to closing the pay gap. Instead, the incoming Trump administration has expressed little to no interest in continuing the fight for pay equality ― beyond empty statements made by the president-elect’s daughter Ivanka.Indeed, one of Trump’s only policies that touches on the issue ― a misguided maternity leave proposal that doesn’t include anyone except married women who physically give birth ― poses the risk of exacerbating the gender pay gap by making women less desirable employees.When so-called “women’s issues” come up, President-elect Trump has so far handed them off to his daughter. The New York Times reported that when House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) recently rang Trump to discuss these issues, he put Ivanka on the phone. And while she has publicly spoken out in favor of equal pay for women, there’s little sign she or her dad understand that closing the pay gap has profound economic implications.Women make up about half of the labor force and run near a majority of the households in this country; paying them fairly would lift the entire economy. Put another way, this isn’t a “women’s issue” best left to a de facto first lady. Achieving gender parity in the workforce could add $4.3 trillion to the economy by 2025, a report from McKinsey found.“Inequality in the workforce doesn’t just adversely affect women; it affects our families and our broader economy,” White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett said in a statement to The Huffington Post. The equality pledge certainly signals that the fight for equal pay would continue beyond the Obama administration, but it seems clear that this battle is moving into the private sector and academia.On Wednesday, some of the companies who have signed on to the pay pledge also announced a partnership with Simmons College, which will help that group ― Employers for Pay Equity ― solidify best practices and develop better hiring, promotion and pay policies.“The ultimate goal is to get more women into leadership and pay equity,” said Elisa Van Dam, senior director of executive education at the Simmons School of Management. The election has left many who care about equal pay feeling “distressed and concerned,” Van Dam said. But also “feeling like our work is more important than ever.”Separately on Wednesday, the CEOs of about two dozen other large companies ― including Bank of America and Accenture ― announced an initiative meant to get more women up the executive ladder. Called the Paradigm for Parity, the group’s expressed goal is getting women into 50 percent of leadership roles in corporate America by 2030. Right now women hold about 19 percent of “C-suite” positions.And on Tuesday, a group of investors publicly called for Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and other major financial companies to publicly disclose their gender pay data.Taken together, these moves demonstrate that for many firms there is a real commitment to paying women fairly that will last beyond the Obama administration. “No doubt this election has been really emotional; we need to focus on moving forward together,” Ashley Goldsmith, chief people officer at Workday, told HuffPost. The HR software company is one of the latest crop of signatories on the pledge. “I don’t think this topic will drop off. It’s something that all of us should address regardless of the administration.”For global businesses seeking to hire more women, the equal pay issue isn’t going away. And in recent years, more employers have taken the initiative on pay ― Salesforce spent $3 million handing out raises to women to eliminate bias in their payroll. Workday, for its part, developed real-time software to track pay and promotions to seek out bias. Other firms have voluntarily started reporting data on pay.Fair pay isn’t just the right thing to do, it’s good business, Maatz said. When women aren’t paid fairly, they quit their jobs. Equal pay fosters higher retention rates and raises productivity, research has shown.In 2016, women on average make 80 cents for every dollar a white man earns, a slight improvement from 77 cents on the dollar when Obama took office. The gap is worse for black women (63 cents) and Latinas (54 cents). It’s doubtful that the private sector alone would be able to close the persistent gap. First, the pay gap is extremely complicated. Women earn less than men because of deeply entrenched biases that kick up almost at birth, as girls are encouraged to do certain kinds of work. They’re built into the pay for jobs ― janitors, mostly male, for example, make more money than housekeepers, mostly female. Jobs that are majority female pay less than jobs that are majority male, research has shown. Pay gaps are even wider at the very top of the job market, where women may be unable to compete because of responsibilities at home ― and where entrenched bias over what a “real boss” looks like remain.There are missing public policies that would go much further than private initiatives. For example, raising the minimum wage would lift the pay of millions of women who make up the majority of low-income earners. A fair and equitable parental leave policy would keep more women in the workforce, raising their earning potential and pay. Child care policies that made it easier for women to work and care for their kids wouldn’t hurt either.Some of this will happen and is happening at the local level. Last year alone 36 bills regarding equal pay were proposed by state legislatures ― six of them passed, in places such as Nebraska, Utah and Massachusetts. Measures involved prohibiting retaliation for workers who discuss pay, forbidding employers from asking about a candidate’s pay history and increasing penalties for business who violate equal pay laws. “The will for equal pay is at a high tide,” the AAUW’s Maatz said. “Even if Trump falls down, state legislatures will keep this going.”"

Only President Xi has the power, argues Crosta, to shut down China’s domestic ivory trade that drives so much of the killing of Africa’s rapidly diminishing elephant population.Crosta is among the central characters in “The Ivory Game,” where he is also joined by Nairobi-based conservation activist and founder of the nonprofit organization China House Kenya, Huang Hongxiang. Huang and Crosta traveled the world to expose the complex trading networks that facilitate the illicit ivory trade. While Huang generally agrees with Crosta that the Chinese president plays a large role in the destiny of these animals, he also cautions that it will take more than just Xi Jinping’s policies to stop the killing.Huang joins Eric & Cobus  ― in the podcast above ― to discuss more about the undercover sting operations he participated in for “The Ivory Game,” and why he feels it is so important to demonstrate that Chinese activists like him are risking their lives in the effort to save Africa’s elephants from extinction.Join the conversation. Do you agree with Crosta that, for the first time ever, an entire animal species will be determined by just one person? Or do you share Huang’s more nuanced view that it will take a collaborative effort among Asian, American, European and African leaders to finally shut down the ivory trade that fuels illegal poaching?

For instance, the country didn’t legalize divorce until 2011. In 2013, however, voters brought a social democratic government, the Labor Party, to power. The party is liberal, enabling the government to pass more progressive laws.In 2014, Maltese parliament approved a bill that grants marriage rights to LGBTQ couples, including the possibility to adopt children.A spokesperson from the Malta Chamber of Psychologists, which played a part in drafting the recently passed bill, told Malta Today that it is proud of its role in helping to outlaw a practice it considers inhumane.“As a body we promote respect and equality for all persons, and are determined to continue working towards ensuring our clients can enjoy as safe a therapeutic experience as they deserve.”In the same session, Parliament also passed amendments to the country’s Gender Identity, Gender Expression and Sex Characteristics Act. The changes made will now allow anyone who is 16 years or older to have their gender legally changed without parental approval or having to file an application in court."

Speaking Tuesday from the MacDill Air Force base in Tampa, Florida, Obama defended his legacy ― both from hawks who have accused him of withdrawing from the Middle East, and from liberals who have criticized his reliance on expansive surveillance and drones to fight wars. The outgoing president sought to convince the country that he had struck the correct balance, and encouraged the next administration to follow in his footsteps. Though he never mentioned president-elect by name, it was clear that Donald Trump was the intended recipient of some of his remarks.“We’re a nation that believes freedom can never be taken for granted and that each of us has a responsibility to sustain it,” Obama said Tuesday. “The universal right to speak your mind and to protest against authority, to live in a society that’s open and free, that can criticize a president without retribution,” he continued, in an apparent jab at Trump’s tendency to threaten legal action against his critics. As he defended his own actions as president, Obama zeroed in on several areas where Trump had promised to reverse current policy. Presented as a numbered list, it felt at times like an inventory of the achievements Obama felt were most vulnerable. Obama defended the Iran nuclear agreement as an international effort that made the world safer ― knowing that in a little over a month, Trump will have the ability to unilaterally scrap years’ worth of diplomatic wrangling. The outgoing president recalled one of his first moves in office ― the decision to ban torture as a means of interrogation. No military official, Obama said, had told him that the decision had compromised intelligence gathering efforts. “Despite all the political rhetoric about the need to strip terrorists of their rights, our interrogation teams have obtained valuable information from terrorists without resorting to torture, without operating outside the law,” Obama said. While campaigning, Trump repeatedly said he would command subordinates to use waterboarding “and worse” to extract information from enemies ― but that move would likely face resistance within the military and intelligence community, and would run counter to U.S. and international law. In his speech, Obama hailed the U.S. court system as a preferable way to prosecute suspected terrorists than the military commissions at Guantanamo Bay, where pretrial proceedings against the alleged plotters of the Sept. 11 terror attacks drag on indefinitely. He cited Times Square car bomber Faisal Shahzad, Boston marathon bomber Dzhokar Tsarnaev, and underwear bomber Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab as examples of terrorists who have been captured, interrogated without using torture, and convicted in federal courts.“American juries and judges have determined that none of these people will know freedom again,” Obama said. “But we did it lawfully.” Individuals accused of plotting attacks abroad, like Abu Khattala, a Libyan suspected of leading the Benghazi attack, and Ahmed Warsame, an alleged al Qaeda leader, have also faced charges in U.S. courts, Obama said. “We can get these terrorists and stay true to who we are.”The president’s praise of the effort to prosecute and imprison enemies domestically underscored the weight of his failure to close the Guantanamo Bay prison, which Trump has pledged to keep in operation. The president-elect has even suggested he would try American citizens in the ill-functioning war court at Guantanamo. In his final months in office, Obama has dramatically downsized the prison population at Guantanamo, but he’s been blocked by Congress from transferring any detainees to the U.S. Fifty-nine remain.At times, Obama’s description of his national security legacy ― which he has framed as a lawful, transparent and diplomacy-first approach to resolving international disputes ― rang hollow. The president cited a 2013 agreement with Russia over Syria’s chemical weapons program as a diplomatic triumph that “eliminated Syria’s declared chemical weapons program.” While the agreement did remove some of the Assad regime’s stockpile, there have been numerous chemical weapons used since, which human rights groups have assessed were used by Syrian government forces. In a final effort to push back against critics of his administration’s reliance on drones ― and set a precedent for the Trump administration ― Obama listed on Tuesday what he said were examples of his administration’s commitment to transparency and accountability, even as it oversaw a largely secret targeted killing program. The president cited the recent decision to release reports about civilians killed in drone strikes outside of war zones ― but the administration’s civilian death count is far less than the numbers recorded by independent observers. He touted the release of a 61-page report that describes the legal justification for ongoing military operations ― but even that report relies on a broad interpretation of the executive branch’s legal authority to wage war with minimal restrictions. The Guardian reported last month that Obama would not tighten the rules governing drone strikes before Trump takes office. Obama battered lawmakers for failing to “do their jobs” and vote on an updated war authorization tailored to the current fight against the Islamic State. In the absence of a new war authorization, Obama has relied on legislation passed by Congress in 2001, perpetuating the constant war footing that the president has repeatedly said he sought to end. “Democracies should not operate in a state of permanently authorized war,” Obama said Tuesday. “That’s not good for our military, it’s not good for our democracy.”Obscured in his rhetoric is the fact that it was Obama, not Congress, who claimed an expansive war-fighting authority under the 2001 AUMF ― and set the precedent for Trump to do the same. In a rare display of public criticism against a president of his own party, ranking House Intelligence Committee member Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) noted on Twitter Obama’s role in setting the precedent for an all-expansive interpretation of the 2001 war authorization.

The justices may not be willing to let it go further.",2016-12-07,The Supreme Court has been reluctant to set new rules governing the use of force by police officers.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5841da901800002d00e409e4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― For the first time since Ferguson, Missouri, became synonymous with police brutality, the Supreme Court will take a hard look at what the Constitution has to say about excessive force, exploring if there are legal mechanisms that may help victims hold officers accountable for violating their civil rights.Without much fanfare, the court last week agreed to hear County of Los Angeles v. Mendez ― a case that, on its facts alone, is not unlike the long parade of incidents where people of color are targeted by officers who are simply too quick to pull the trigger.The case is significant because it will offer the justices and the public a chance to learn about a quirk in the law of policing. The so-called “provocation rule,” which only applies in the nine states covered by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, opens up officers to liability if they act unconstitutionally in the lead-up to their encounters with everyday citizens.“I’m optimistic that the Supreme Court will see this the same way as I do,” said Leonard Feldman ― whose clients, Angel and Jennifer Mendez, won a $4 million verdict after a federal judge concluded that two Los Angeles County sheriff deputies weren’t entitled to legal immunity for their misconduct.The Mendezes’ near-fatal experience seems all too familiar. While looking for an armed fugitive and without a warrant, the two county deputies broke into their wooden shack, which was located in the backyard of a friend’s house and that looked every bit a private residence.“The deputies were told that a couple was living behind the house, and the shack itself was surrounded by an air conditioning unit, electric cord, water hose, and clothes locker,” said the 9th Circuit in a ruling upholding the verdict against the officers.Startled in part by a BB gun that Angel kept by his bedside, the officers fired fifteen rounds at the couple. Jennifer, who was five months pregnant at the time, was shot in the back, and Angel, who got hit several times, lost his right leg below the knee as a result of the injuries. Both survived and sued the officers and Los Angeles county in federal court, claiming a violation of their constitutional rights.This is where the case ― and the provocation rule ― stand out and may have led the Supreme Court to get interested in the case. The two lower courts found that the Mendezes’ shooting itself was reasonable, under a doctrine developed in 1989 by the high court that largely shields officers who resort to excessive force whenever they fear for their lives.But the 9th Circuit, alone in the nation in this area, has a counter-doctrine ― the provocation rule. Under it, any constitutional violation that provokes a law-abiding citizen can create liability for a public official. And here, the courts found that the unannounced, warrantless entry into the Mendezes’ abode ― a violation of the Fourth Amendment in itself ― provoked Angel to motion for his BB gun.This “incompetence,” Feldman said, led to the shooting that severely injured his clients.Seth Stoughton, a University of South Carolina law professor and former police officer who specializes in the law of excessive force, cautioned that, as framed, the Mendez case likely won’t disturb the constitutional standard of Graham v. Connor, the “reasonableness” rule the Supreme Court fashioned in 1989.“It’s generally not a good sign when the court agrees to hear a case about a rule that only one circuit follows,” Stoughton said. He added that, in a best-case scenario, the justices will simply leave the provocation rule alone and note that it’s not inconsistent with the current constitutional ground rules for law enforcement.Scott Greenfield, a criminal defense attorney who writes extensively on criminal law and procedure, said the provocation rule is simply too good to be spared by the Supreme Court.“Perhaps the Court will make this the law of the land, but then, smart money is on the death of the provocation doctrine,” he wrote Tuesday on Fault Lines, a criminal justice blog. “It just makes too much sense.”It is no secret to observers of the court that the justices are reluctant to develop new rules for use-of-force incidents. Last year, in a Texas case that immunized an officer who shot and killed a Latino driver, Justice Sonia Sotomayor sounded the alarm that she and her colleagues weren’t doing enough to set new rules of engagement for officers.“By sanctioning a ‘shoot first, think later’ approach to policing, the court renders the protections of the Fourth Amendment hollow,” Sotomayor wrote in a lone dissenting opinion. The case was decided summarily and without oral arguments.The Mendez case, on the other hand, will get full briefing and oral arguments ― and may very well draw the attention of advocates and outside groups who may want to educate the court on how the Constitution plays out on the ground. Stoughton said he may do just that.“Honestly, I’m worried about this one,” he said in a follow-up email. He predicted a likely 4-to-4 split among conservative and liberal justices. (The Supreme Court has had a vacant seat since the late Justice Antonin Scalia died in February.)Feldman, the Mendezes’ lawyer, has another worry: that the court’s involvement will only delay justice for his clients. “This is a situation where one of the undisputed facts of the case is that they did nothing wrong and were very significantly harmed,” he said. “Not just pain and suffering, but medical bills. The continuing review of the case delays their ability to move forward.”The Supreme Court is expected to hear County of Los Angeles v. Mendez early next year."

Flynn is an adviser to his father, Gen. Mike Flynn, whom Trump has named national security adviser. Miller said on Tuesday that the younger Flynn had been assisting his father “with some administration and scheduling duties early on in the transition process.” Trump sources have also said that he attended “a ton of meetings” with his father and helped evaluate potential staffers.Trump’s team sought to downplay the younger Flynn’s role in the transition after CNN discovered on Monday that he had an official .gov email address, indicating that he was working for the transition team.In an MSNBC interview on Tuesday morning, Vice President-elect Mike Pence claimed the younger Flynn “has no involvement in the transition whatsoever.” Later in the day, Pence reluctantly confirmed to CNN’s Jake Tapper that the transition team had requested a security clearance for him.“Well, whatever the appropriate paperwork was to assist him in that regard, Jake, I’m sure was taking place,” Pence said. “But that’s no longer the case.”Both Flynn and his father frequently share links and conspiracy theories from fake news sources, including allegations of Hillary Clinton’s “sex crimes.” Trump himself regularly promotes such stories to his millions of followers, according to an analysis of his tweets, and he based much of his campaign rhetoric on conspiracy theories and unsubstantiated claims."

Osbourne, 32, received the Trevor Hero Honoree Award at the Trevor Project’s TrevorLIVE Los Angeles 2016 fundraiser on Dec. 4, according to The Hollywood Reporter. When the singer-actress took the stage at the Beverly Hilton to accept the award, she urged those in attendance to keep an open mind about the divisive president-elect. “We’re living in a time when we might not have the future president that we wanted in this country. And as an immigrant who can’t vote, I don’t really get to say much,” Osbourne told the crowd, which included the likes of Matt Bomer, Margaret Cho and Jack Falahee, among other stars. “But tonight, I do. People voted for him. So just like they gave us a chance to love equally, we will fight to keep that.”“We have to give [Trump] a chance,” she added, “And we do it by spreading love, not hate.” The comments may come as a surprise given Osbourne’s longstanding support of the LGBTQ community. The outspoken advocate has worked with The Trevor Project, which is the nation’s leading suicide prevention organization for LGBTQ youth, as well as Cyndi Lauper’s True Colors Fund for homeless queer youth. In June, she debuted a striking head tattoo that read “solidarity” in honor of the 49 victims of the mass shooting at Orlando’s Pulse nightclub. Regardless of her intent, Osbourne might have reconsidered the tone of her remarks given The Trevor Project’s aim. While Trump’s views on the LGBTQ community are spotty at best, Vice President-elect Mike Pence has been a supporter of so-called “conversion therapy,” and has defended LGBTQ discrimination under the guise of religious liberty. Arguing that homosexuality is “a choice,” he’s no fan of same-sex marriage, either. Let’s try to be a bit more sensitive to the cause next time, Kelly. "

But the meat of the article lay in breaking down the world we find ourselves in. A world that, in Fey’s eyes, feels a bit like a slowly climbing rollercoaster that has suddenly started to fall backwards. “It feels like we were on the precipice of things getting pretty good, and now we’re in a bit of a throwback moment. I definitely came out of last month feeling misogyny is much more real than two years ago,” Fey told Letterman.“But the thing I worry about [more] than actual human interaction is the internet,” she added. “Because that’s just despicable: people just being able to be awful to each other without having to be in the same room. It’s metastasizing now, thanks to our glorious president-elect who can’t muster the dignity of a seventh-grader. It’s so easy for people to abuse each other and to abandon all civility.”Anyone who has spent significant time interacting with people on the internet can attest to what Fey is talking about. Online, it is much easier to be harsh and biting online. Online, it is easier to voice your opinion without having to listen to the retort. To spew hate without consideration for those it affects.The internet doesn’t provide us the empathy-generation machine that real-life interaction does. In person, face to face, it is harder, if not impossible, for humans to cut themselves off from the divergent opinions around them. Real-life interaction provides us with one of the most wonderful things about our species: the ability to feel compassion. Too often, the internet takes that sense of compassion away.Fey and Letterman spoke as part of the leadup to The Hollywood Reporter honoring Fey with the Sherry Lansing Leadership Award, given to women who are pioneers in their industry.

26,POLITICS,Donald Trump Picks Fossil Fuel-Friendly Oklahoma Attorney General To Head EPA,Kate Sheppard,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-pruitt-environmental-protection-agency_us_584856f1e4b0b9feb0dab14f,Scott Pruitt has a history of working with the oil and gas industry.,2016-12-07,Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt is reportedly Donald Trump's pick to head the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/584857441700002500e7e4e0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President-elect Donald Trump has picked Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to serve as the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, his former campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told reporters Wednesday.Pruitt has been a vocal critic of EPA regulations and defender of fossil fuel interests. Lawyers for Devon Energy, one of his state’s biggest oil and gas companies, authored a letter Pruitt sent to the EPA criticizing estimates on emissions from natural gas drilling sites, The New York Times reported in 2014. The Times published 84 pages of correspondence between Pruitt and Devon, which it described as evidence of an “unprecedented, secretive alliance that Mr. Pruitt and other Republican attorneys general have formed with some of the nation’s top energy producers to push back against the Obama regulatory agenda.”The Trump transition team has looked at Pruitt’s state as a model for a looser regulatory approach to fossil fuel development despite the fact that Oklahoma is being rocked ― literally ― by earthquakes linked to underground disposal of wastewater from oil and gas operations. Pruitt was first elected attorney general in 2010. His online biography describes him as “a leading advocate against the EPA’s activist agenda,” and says he “established Oklahoma’s first federalism unit to combat unwarranted regulation and overreach by the federal government.”Under Pruitt’s lead, Oklahoma was one of two dozen states to file suit against the EPA over the Clean Power Plan, the Obama administration’s regulatory effort to curb emissions from power plants. Pruitt said he would ensure that the power plant rules, and other regulatory efforts from the current administration, “will ... not survive his presidency.”He told a 2014 meeting of oil and gas executives that “there is a reason to have an agency called the EPA, and it has served a historical purpose I believe is vital to this country.” He suggested, however, that President Barack Obama’s EPA had been anti-fossil fuels.“I will say to you today that the historical purpose EPA has served is not what is occurring,” he said, according to Tulsa World.(The fact that Pruitt thinks the EPA should exist might be seen as some small consolation, since Trump once said on the campaign trail that he might eliminate the “Department of Environmental,” which is not a real thing.)The National Institute on Money In State Politics database shows that Pruitt has brought in nearly $325,000 in donations from the natural resources energy sector. Oil and gas tycoon Harold Hamm from Oklahoma ― who has been discussed as a potential Trump pick to head the Department of Energy ― led Pruitt’s 2013 re-election campaign. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), the Senate’s most vocal critic of the idea that human activity is causing climate change, called Pruitt “one of [his] closest personal friends” and said he is well-suited for the job.“He’s very familiar with all the issues,” Inhofe told reporters Wednesday afternoon. “He’s been involved in every issue having to to do with the EPA that I have been involved with. He would be very exciting.”Environmentalists swiftly bashed Pruitt’s selection.“It’s often said that personnel is policy, and President-elect Trump’s decision to nominate someone who has spent his career catering to Big Polluters speaks volumes,” League of Conservation Voters President Gene Karpinski said in a statement. “All people in this country have a right to breathe clean air, drink clean water, and enjoy the economic and health benefits of the clean energy revolution, and it’s vitally important that we have an EPA administrator who respects those rights.”Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz (D) told reporters that Pruitt’s selection is “the worst-case scenario when it comes to clean air, clean water.” He pledged that he and other senators who care about climate change would “pursue every procedure we can” to block his nomination ― although they would need the support of at least some Republicans to do so. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), the incoming minority leader, said in a statement that Pruitt has shown a “reluctance to accept the facts or science on climate change” and “has a troubling history of advocating on behalf of big oil at the expense of public health.”“I expect he will have to answer many tough questions throughout the nomination process to address these significant concerns,” Schumer said.Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, a moderate Democrat from North Dakota who has been more sympathetic to industry concerns than others in her party, said she doesn’t really know Pruitt but will give him a “fair evaluation.”Laura Barron-Lopez contributed reporting."

She learned in a hateful note that someone has a problem with that.On Nov. 18, Markland received a letter in the mail with a message that read, “Women who weigh 300 pounds should not wear yoga pants!” Inside the envelope was also a cruel meme referencing Markland’s leggings. The Florida mom shared the note on Facebook, pointing out how hateful the message was.“Anyone who knows me, knows that I care deeper and stronger than many,” she wrote. “I am a sensitive woman and I despise cruelty towards others. At 36 years old, I am STILL being made fun of. Whoever sent this, be an adult and tell me who you are. JUST TELL ME!!!”Markland told The Huffington Post she doesn’t know how the person who sent the letter found her mailing address. The mom of two said if she could be face-to-face with the sender she would want to know why they would do something so hurtful. But she would actually like to thank the person, too.“This one incident has really helped me find strength that I didn’t know I had,” she said. “This incident gave me a voice and a message to share with all women.”Markland said the response to her post about the letter has been overwhelming and that she has learned that so many other women have experienced the same feelings she has had after reading the note. Since she posted the letter, women have posted photos of their leggings in a touching move of solidarity.Liz Grimes of Love and Limes Photography also reached out to Markland to tell her she wanted to do a photo shoot with her. With help from a friend who works with LuLaRoe, Grimes also organized for some of the company’s consultants to style Markland for the shoot. On her blog, Grimes wrote that Markland has “a heart of gold.”Aside from finding other women to talk to who have been through similar experiences, Markland has used the letter as a teaching moment for her kids. She has spoken to them about bullying before, but now they can see firsthand how harmful words can be."

Melania famously used Obama’s words for her speech at the 2016 Republican National Convention. ”I figured if Melania Trump can use them and have success, I should try,” Fisher joked. The 40-year-old actress closed her speech by naming Donald Trump as the inspiration for her continued success. “I do need to thank Trump,” Fisher said. “I don’t think I’d be here if it weren’t for him showing the world that unqualified orange people can win things.” If only that weren’t the understatement of the year.

It’s possible,” said Tom O’Neil, editor of awards prediction website Goldderby.com.What is exciting about the 2017 contenders is the range of topics, said Darnell Hunt, director of the Ralph J. Bunche Center for African-American Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles.“The criticism of Hollywood has been in the past that if you are making a black film, it’s either going to be about slavery or civil rights,” Hunt said.That is hardly the case for “Moonlight,” a heart-wrenching, contemporary tale of a black boy growing up in Miami struggling with bullying, his sexual identity and the scourge of drugs. Made with little-known actors, it has gotten some of the best reviews of the year and has been nominated for six Independent Spirit Awards. “Hidden Figures,” opening on Christmas Day, is the true story of three unsung African-American women mathematicians (played by Octavia Spencer, Janelle Monae and Taraji P. Henson) who worked on NASA’s early space missions, while “Lion,” starring Dev Patel, is the real-life tale of an Indian child who gets lost in Calcutta and is adopted by a white couple in Australia.“Loving” focuses on an unassuming blue-collar white man and black woman in Virginia who were sentenced to prison in 1958 for getting married. “Fences,” the movie version of the Pulitzer-winning stage play by August Wilson, is expected to bring Oscar nominations for stars Denzel Washington and Viola Davis.ALTERNATIVES TO ‘BIRTH OF A NATION’Nominations for Golden Globes and Screen Actors Guild awards are announced next week, while Oscar nominees are unveiled on Jan 24.Most of this year’s contenders were in production before the Hollywood soul-searching prompted by #OscarsSoWhite. But unlike some previous years, movie studios are throwing money behind promoting them.“If you have a film that is diverse in terms of the cast and tells nontraditional stories, you’re definitely going to get some mileage out of that and promote it. And the media are going to highlight it in ways that maybe they didn’t four or five years ago,” said Hunt.Ironically, “The Birth of a Nation,” the slave rebellion drama that looked like an Oscar front-runner earlier this year, now appears to be out of awards contention.Bought for $17.5 million in a bidding war at the Sundance Film Festival in January, the movie was later overshadowed by headlines about a 17-year-old rape case involving its writer, director and lead actor, Nate Parker, who was acquitted in a 2001 trial.The film has taken in just $16 million at the North American box office since opening in October.“The controversy really tripped up the film. It made it uncool to see the film even though it had done very well at early festivals and with film critics,” said Goldderby.com’s O’Neil.Fortunately for an awards season looking to redeem itself on the diversity front, “there are other alternatives to fall back on,” O’Neil said."

John Kelly, who headed U.S. Southern Command until earlier this year, is the latest person with a military background that President-elect Donald Trump has tapped to serve as a Cabinet secretary.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/584833ac170000620fe7e3f7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President-elect Donald Trump plans to nominate retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, a border hawk and yet another general, as his secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, multiple news outlets reported on Wednesday. DHS could be extremely powerful under Trump because many of his campaign promises fall within its purview: building a border wall, ramping up deportations, creating a Muslim registry and enacting a ban on certain people entering the country. The selection of Kelly, a recently retired four-star general, to head the Department of Homeland Security, would add to the growing concern that Trump is increasingly filling his Cabinet and top advisory positions with generals ― particularly ones that clashed with President Barack Obama. (The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the decision.)Trump has already nominated retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn as his national security advisor and Gen. James Mattis to serve as Defense Secretary. Mattis has only been out of the military for three years, so he will require a waiver from Congress in order to head the Pentagon. In an attempt to guarantee civilian control of the military, current law requires the secretary of defense to have been out of active duty for at least seven years. The last Pentagon chief to require a waiver was George Marshall, who assumed the job in 1950, three years after leaving the military.The president-elect is also reportedly considering retired Gen. David Petraeus and Adm. James Stavridis for Secretary of State. Retired Gen. Jack Keane and Adm. Michael Rogers were previously in the running for top positions in the Trump administration. As Kelly and Mattis were floated for Cabinet secretaries, the two generals and former colleagues recommended one another during meetings with Trump, The Washington Post reported last month. Kelly has experience in DHS-related issues. Until earlier this year, he led U.S. Southern Command, which oversees the Guantanamo Bay military prison in Cuba and operations in South and Central America. Kelly currently serves on the Homeland Security Advisory Council, which makes recommendations to the secretary. He did not endorse Trump or Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, but he said he was open to serving in either administration. Kelly criticized them both in a July interview with Foreign Policy, saying they were “not serious yet about the issues” with regards to generalized statements on national security. The election winner “will be in desperate need — and I mean desperate need — of military and foreign policy advice, because the world out there is just getting crazier and crazier,” he added.Kelly reportedly caught Trump’s attention based on a 2015 testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee in which he said the government was “overlooking a significant security threat” on the southwest border from gangs and smugglers. They “could unwittingly, or even wittingly, facilitate the movement of terrorist operatives or weapons of mass destruction toward our borders, potentially undetected and almost completely unrestricted,” he said. There was “not yet any indication that the criminal networks involved in human and drug trafficking are interested in supporting the efforts of terrorist groups,” he added.But Kelly has also expressed a more understanding approach than Trump’s to dealing with an influx of immigrant arrivals at the southwest border from Central America. “We have a right to protect our borders, whether they’re seaward, coastlines, or land borders,” Kelly told Military Times earlier this year. “We have a right to do that. Every country has a right to do that. Obviously, some form of control whether it’s a wall or a fence. But if the countries where these migrants come from have reasonable levels of violence and reasonable levels of economic opportunity, then the people won’t leave to come here.”Though Kelly said he never obstructed Obama’s efforts to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, he has been publicly dismissive of the president’s claim that leaving it open provides terrorist groups with a recruiting tool.“Bombing the living shit out of ISIS in Iraq and Afghanistan, Syria, that would maybe irritate them more than the fact we have Guantanamo open,” he told Defense One just before retiring earlier this year. For terrorist groups and rights activists alike, “[w]hat tends to bother them is the fact that we’re holding them there indefinitely without trial.” That’s not the point of the facility, Kelly said. “If we send them, say, to a facility in the U.S., we’re still holding them without trial,” he added.Kelly has also pushed back against the idea that some prisoners ended up in Guantanamo Bay because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time. “We can quibble over what they were doing on the battlefield when we took them, but every one of them is a bad guy,” he told NPR in March.Trump passed over others floated as potential DHS secretaries, such as House Homeland Security Chairman Mike McCaul (R-Texas) and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach. The latter could still have a top role to fulfill his proposals for a Muslim registry and ramped up deportations ― he is reportedly being considered for deputy secretary."

Obama, the 44th President of the United States, it became customary for some to suggest",2016-12-07,<p><strong>Obama Victory Print to commemorate his historic win</strong> </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5847c1b71200001400eedf0e.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After the 2008 election of Barack H. Obama, the 44th President of the United States, it became customary for some to suggest that America was a colorblind or “post-racial” nation. The notion that America had arrived at a moment of putative “racelessness”— or that the U.S. had altogether transcended race and racism — was predicated narrowly and falsely on the fact that a black person was elected “by the people, for the people” to the highest office in American government and, indeed, as leader of the free world. Such claims were utterly wrong. And it is precisely, in part, because we do not live in a post-racial society but, rather, a most racial society that the 2016 election was not surprising.To be clear, I am southern, African American, Catholic, from Louisiana and working in a post-Katrina New Orleans that is still “recovering” from neglect, as is the state itself — more recently — from the hellacious, debilitating policies of former Governor Bobby Jindal. And as a professor of English, African American Studies, and Women’s Studies, I am by no means ahistorical. Those of us who are all-too-familiar with the arc of history know that with every sign of (black) progress, whether perceived or actual, backlash follows. Our nation has shown that on countless occasions. From the end of the Reconstruction — with the 1876 election and (Hayes) Compromise of 1877 that “officiated” the Jim Crow segregation era — to current abridgements and overturning of laws enacted to protect civil, voting, and human rights in the 1960s, 1970s and beyond, steps are constantly being taken to suppress votes and previously won rights.After two terms of the first African American U.S. president and the Obamas as the First Family, and the Black Lives Matter movement, November 8, 2016 was not surprising. It was far from shocking because the proverbial train that rages against progress, diversity, and inclusion regarding race, gender, sexuality, and religion is never ever late. And, too, “I’ve been black way too long,” as the saying goes, to be surprised by the 2016 election in which Trump’s platform appealed to those who harbor racist, xenophobic, sexist, Islamophobic or other types of hatred and disdain. It also tapped into the frustrated and nativist notion, “Make America Great Again,” which essentially translates into “make America white again.” As is oft the case, he achieved this vis-à-vis the age-old maneuver of stigmatizing as well as rendering blacks and others as stagnate, inferior and, thereby, threatening. History and the writings of Du Bois are instructive and useful here.In 1903, when W.E.B. Du Bois penned The Souls of Black Folks, at the crux of his consequential work was not only an examination of race or “the color-line” in the 20th century and beyond, but also a foundational question: “How does it feel to be a problem?” This query or sensibility — the perception of blackness as somehow inherently problematic — is precisely, in part, what Du Bois explores as he theorizes the dialectic of being black in America: that is, the very precarious relationship of black people and, by extension, blackness to America.When looking at America from the vantage point of how black people and black identity are rendered a “problem,” an anomaly, or as the diametrical opposite of “Americanness”— almost always conflated with whiteness —what becomes transparent is that America’s experiment in democracy and inclusion has not been fully realized. Furthermore, black people have historically played an integral role in the “building of an American democratic republic or nation,” which has essentially required the fundamental debasement, relegation, and stigmatization of black people. To this end, the subordination of black people constitutes “the necessary condition for the flourishing of American democracy,” to quote Cornel West, and “the tragic prerequisite for America itself.” This is why the ascent of Donald J. Trump in this very moment as president-elect is not unpredictable, even as it has, surprisingly, caused a state of consternation, disbelief, and shock among many.What became transparent throughout the 2016 election season is how Trump, whether deliberately or inadvertently, capitalized on and deployed associations of black identity with a state of disarray: as problematic in not simply condition but also inherently by nature. He achieved this on his campaign trail and during debates in his references to “the blacks” and “the African Americans” through a type of ‘othering’ and stigmatizing of black people. “What do you have to lose by trying something new, like Trump?,” he exclaimed, “You’re living in your poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs, 58 percent of your youth is unemployed.” Asserting this to an almost exclusively white audience in Virginia—wherein resonates Thomas Jefferson’s very own Notes on the State of Virginia in which he discusses the inherent natural inferiority of blacks—Trump disseminates statistics that were grossly and exponentially inflated.His statement also exaggerated the state of black folks while generalizing black people’s varied conditions to a deplorable and destitute status (usually relegating black folks to “inner cities” or neighborhood “war zones”). To some who heard this, it may have suggested that “the system has failed you.” Yet, it was more far-reaching because it sent the message that blacks, as well as other marginalized groups, are a “collective problem” holding America back. This message was reinforced in his reductive assertions that Mexicans are “rapists and criminals” as well as “illegals,” as he characterized them, while Muslims and Muslim Americans are “radical Islamic terrorists.”The problem was not that blacks were problematic, nor were Mexicans, Muslims, women, those differently-abled, or others but, rather, that far too many folks had assumed that America as a nation had arrived at a destination of marked democratic freedom, equality, and progress. They were short-sighted.What this election confirms, instead, is what those committed to social justice, anti-racism, and anti-discrimination have long known and articulated: “nope,” we have not yet arrived. And that audacity of “nope,” that clarity as to where we all stand, is precisely what is necessary and essential to get us where we need to go. A catalogue of denial, violence, or suppression will not work.As writer-activist James Baldwin reminds us, “not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced.” In this election, America and each and every one of us have been issued a mirror. The question is, in facing reality unadorned and seeing it for exactly what it is, how will we, the people, respond?This article originally appeared on the African American Intellectual History Society blog"

Then some disturbing and unanticipated results came out of Pennsylvania, and in short order Gun-sense Nation went from dreaming about the possibility of reducing gun violence during a Hillary Clinton presidency to figuring out how to keep the issue of gun violence prevention alive during the Age of Trump. Let’s begin counting the numbers which don’t look so good. The Senate is still held by the GOP, even if a pro-gun weasel named Kelly Ayotte got tossed out the door. And in the House the GOP dropped a net of 6 seats, but a 241-194 majority is still a good score. At the state level there has never been a time when so many Governors or legislative chambers were colored red. In other words, the current political alignment doesn’t bode well for sensible gun reforms.And here is the basic dilemma facing GVP, namely, that the agenda for reducing gun violence, as sensible and modest as it is, calls for some kind of government intervention for just about every GVP effort likely to emerge. Expanding background checks to secondary transfers requires a change in the law which established NICS. Banning high-capacity magazines and placing limits on the sale of assault rifles also requires action at the federal legislative level, although such initiatives have been implemented in a handful of states. On the other hand, as the number of gun laws in any locality goes up, the amount of gun violence of all kinds goes down. And let’s remember that the next election is now less than two years away. Furthermore, GVP did pretty well last month in state-level ballot initiatives, winning three out of four. So the fact that national legislation might not go forward doesn’t mean there aren’t other ways to skin the proverbial cat. I live in Massachusetts which was the first state to legalize gay marriage in 2004. Eleven years later the SCOTUS declared gay marriage to be law of the land. If that’s what it takes, that’s what it takes.But no matter which strategy is employed to move the issue of gun violence forward, Gun-sense Nation is still going to have to figure out messaging which can be an effective response to the increasingly strident and extreme rhetoric being produced by the other side, in particular the idea that we all have some kind of God-given ‘right’ to protect ourselves and our communities with personally-owned guns. The notion of lawful self-protection comes right out of British Common Law and is embodied in the ‘Life, Liberty and Pursuit of Happiness’ clause of the Declaration of Independence. But nowhere can you find any statute that gives citizens the freedom to make an unhindered decision about how they are going to exercise this ‘right’ to self-defense which, incidentally, isn’t mentioned in the vaunted Second Amendment at all.But here’s the problem. A majority of Americans, certainly more than a majority of the up-and-coming millennials, simply don’t trust government and increasingly Americans are being drawn to considering alternatives to the government when it comes to deciding and regulating civic affairs. You can see this in a recent Harvard poll, in numerous surveys conducted by Pew, and if there was one message that galvanized support for Trump it was the message that government is ‘no good.’The idea that individuals rather than government should be responsible for protecting themselves has been basic NRA doctrine since the organization made a right turn in the late 1970s to support the gun industry’s industry shift to the sale of self-defense guns. So if Gun-sense Nation is going to promote ‘sensible’ gun regulations that require government interventions, the wider issue of the role and value of government will have to be addressed. Unless, of course, we take on the much more difficult problem of creating a culture without guns. Unless..."

A jury found the company violated three design patents held by Apple that govern the iPhone’s curved exterior and icon-based interface.Because these features make the iPhone stand out from competitors, Apple argued that it was entitled to the entire $400 million figure ― which represents Samsung’s entire profits from all of its smartphone models that were found to violate iPhone patents.The Supreme Court rejected that argument, noting that in design patent law ― which requires patent violators to hand over total profits after they’ve been found liable ― the term “article of manufacture” should be read broadly.“So understood, the term ‘article of manufacture’ is broad enough to encompass both a product sold to a consumer as well as a component of that product,” Sotomayor wrote.Notably, the high court declined to go further than that. It’s now up to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which specializes in patent cases, to resolve whether each of the iPhone design patents at issue in this controversy represent the end product or are merely components. What that court decides should significantly limit how big a slice of Samsung’s profits Apple will get.When the Supreme Court heard the case in October, the justices signaled that Apple may be headed for a loss ― and that embattled Samsung would notch a small victory in a string of otherwise bruising court battles that, for the most part, the company has already lost big time.“It seems to me that the design is applied to the exterior case of the phone. It’s not applied to ... all the chips and wires,” Chief Justice John Roberts said at the hearing. “So there shouldn’t be profits awarded based on the entire price of the phone.”Apple downplayed the significance of the ruling and said the focus should be on Samsung’s theft of patented ideas ― a fight that will continue in the lower courts.“The question before the Supreme Court was how to calculate the amount Samsung should pay for their copying. Our case has always been about Samsung’s blatant copying of our ideas, and that was never in dispute,” Apple spokeswoman Rachel Wolf Tulley said in a statement to The Huffington Post. “We will continue to protect the years of hard work that has made iPhone the world’s most innovative and beloved product.”Samsung did not respond to requests for comment.Alexander Kaufman contributed reporting."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/584736d4170000620fe7e244.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― For 14 years, Carmelina Cadena has worked as an immigration court interpreter, serving as a bridge between judges, attorneys and immigrants who can’t explain in English why they came to the U.S. or fear being deported.Cadena has seen a change in the courts in the past year. She says standards have deteriorated, as has her compensation: She no longer gets reimbursed for many of the expenses she incurs traveling around the country for court hearings, and her total pay now is lower.But what Cadena is most worried about is the immigrants who will suffer ― or already are suffering ― when experienced immigration court interpreters are replaced with new hires who are willing to accept lower pay.Some highly skilled interpreters are leaving immigration court work because of the compensation complaints. They’re being replaced with people with less experience who may make mistakes, interpreters say. Sometimes there are shortages that lead to no interpreter showing up or to courts making do with an interpreter who speaks the immigrant’s second or third language rather than the one best understood. In addition, immigration courts don’t require interpreters to have the same types of certification required by other state and federal courts, which, interpreters say, leads to jobs going to people who may not be prepared. “This is somebody’s life that is relying on your ability to relay their story,” said Cadena, who is originally from Guatemala and speaks two Mayan dialects: Acateco and Canjobal. “If the [interpreter] doesn’t know what something means and they get stumped on it and they don’t say it, that could be the difference between that person having to go back to a country where they’re facing danger.”She is part of a group of immigration court interpreters pushing back on what they argue is unfair pay and lower standards from SOSi, the corporation that in 2015 received a contract to handle interpretation for immigration courts using independent contractors, such as Cadena.The interpreters’ fight is happening on multiple fronts this week. On Monday, a group of immigration court interpreters sued the government contractor in federal court, claiming they are not being paid for all of their work and expenses.Also Monday, a union leader and immigrant rights organizer wrote to the Department of Justice that immigrants’ due process is suffering because of poor labor practices and low standards for certification for interpreters.And Wednesday, immigration court interpreters will join a protest in Washington, D.C., over low wages for federal government contract workers.It’s a labor battle with high stakes for immigrants in court proceedings, many of whom need an interpreter to communicate with the judges who will decide their fate. The federal government often outsources the work in an effort to save money, but interpreters and attorneys say that outsourcing this service to SOSi has hurt both the workers and the people they’re trying to help.In their suit, interpreters allege that they are not compensated for all of the time they work and are not properly reimbursed for costs. They are required to arrive at court 30 minutes before a hearing and go through security screenings, for example, but that time doesn’t count toward their pay, nor does wait time between hearings or the time it takes to set up, according to the complaint.Labor problems hurt due process for immigrants, argued Bernard Lunzer, News Guild-CWA president, and Gustavo Torres, executive director of the immigrant advocacy group CASA de Maryland in their letter to the Department of Justice, which asked for an investigation into whether SOSi is meeting standards for quality in interpreting. (Although they are not unionized, many SOSi immigration court interpreters are part of the Interpreters Guild of America, which is affiliated with the News Guild-CWA.) The Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment on the letter or the complaints about SOSi. An SOSi spokeswoman said in a statement that the company does not typically comment on litigation but that it “has successfully recruited many independent contractors who provide interpretive services in 300 languages and dialects” in support of the Executive Office for Immigration Review. She said the complaint was from “one former independent contractor” and that its allegations “are baseless and do not accurately represent the Company’s business.”“Founded more than 25 years ago as an interpretation agency, SOSi is committed to contracting with the top providers of interpretive services and serving the DOJ at a very high level,” said the spokeswoman, who asked not to be identified by name.But interpreters and organizers say the training standards seem to be weaker, not stronger, than those for other courts’ interpreters. Angie Birchfield of the Interpreters Guild of America, who does not work for SOSi, said court interpreters required to take one of the often-used certification exams often study for more than a year and usually don’t pass on the first try, given the difficulty of the job.“I have to be a judge, I have to be an attorney, I have to be a doctor, I have to be a layperson, I have to be a gang member, and I have to be an expert witness, and I have to have all of that vocabulary at the tip of my tongue in a different language,” Birchfield said of interpreting. “That in itself can tell you the hours upon hours upon hours of training that we have to go through in order to be as proficient as we need to be in order to be able to handle these kinds of cases.”Some of the newer immigration court interpreters don’t know all of the necessary language, said Victor Nieblas, former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. For example, he said, he has had interpreters not know what an “LPR” means ― the common shorthand for “legal permanent resident.” He said he has noticed more problems in how the system operates since SOSi took over, along with what he’s heard from interpreters he talks to. “The labor dispute is now spilling into the immigration courts, and it’s having an impact on the immigration judges, the attorneys like myself and, more importantly, ... the individuals that are before the courts,” Nieblas said. “That shouldn’t be the case.”For her part, Cadena said she supports higher certification standards and has taken steps to get certification for the state. She said she works hard to keep her language skills up, including by traveling back to Guatemala and learning new language that’s always evolving, such as terms related to technology. The high level of skill required for the job should be reflected in its pay, she argued.“We are the foot soldiers that are going out there, we’re doing a lot of work and we’re not getting the respect that we deserve,” she said.

It should be 100 percent powered by green resources in 2017. The company’s 13 data centers and numerous offices around the world require 5.7 terawatt hours of electricity each year, The Associated Press reports. That’s about how much energy all of San Francisco consumes. “We are convinced this is good for business, this is not about greenwashing. This is about locking in prices for us in the long-term,” Marc Oman, Google’s energy lead in the European Union, told The Guardian. “Increasingly, renewable energy is the lowest-cost option. Our founders are convinced climate change is a real, immediate threat, so we have to do our part.”Google currently relies primarily on wind and solar for clean energy. Steep drops in the cost of each technology ― 60 percent and 80 percent, respectively, in the last six years ― has made renewables a cost-effective option, the company said. Given its huge need and deep pockets, the company negotiates renewable energy purchases with suppliers directly. It signed its first clean-energy contract in 2010, with an Iowa wind farm, and now funds 20 renewable energy projects around the world.Google’s ambitions spread beyond its own energy needs.“Climate change is real,” the company states on a page explaining its responsibility to environmental stewardship. “Every company makes choices — about products, about planning, about purpose, about people. You approach these decisions differently if you’re focused not on your next earnings release, but on future generations that will have to live with the consequences of the choices you make today.”"

He cites the particular challenges of securing a “highly-trafficked, dense urban environment, and one that presents an unprecedented and unique target for potential terrorist activity.”De Blasio requested $35 million to pay for the police stationed at Trump Tower in a Monday letter addressed to President Barack Obama and another to Congress. That sum would cover the period from Election Day to Trump’s inauguration.“Locating a residence within New York City that requires ongoing Presidential-level security presents unprecedented law enforcement concerns. Trump Tower is located in the heart of a prime commercial area in Manhattan,” the mayor wrote. “It is a high-density neighborhood and street traffic easily obstructs pathways to and from the building making it profoundly challenging for the NYPD to establish a secure perimeter.”Trump Tower has long been Trump’s home base. Since his election last month, he has spent the vast majority of his time there, conducting meetings for Cabinet and staff picks and otherwise using it as a headquarters for his transition team. While Trump and his family receive Secret Service protection, the city’s police also assist in the security effort, particularly in protecting the building from the throngs of onlookers.City officials estimated that security around the building is costing city taxpayers as much as $1 million per day.“While the United States Secret Service provides an unparalleled level of personal security to the President-elect and his family, the NYPD is responsible not only for their safety, but for the security of thousands of Trump Tower residents, employees and visitors, and hundreds of thousands of people who are in Midtown at any given moment,” de Blasio wrote.During a press conference on Monday, de Blasio said he would be requesting meetings with the Obama administration and members of Congress to go over the matter in detail. He said that he had already spoken to Steven Mnuchin, Trump’s pick for Treasury secretary, to request “a real important discussion to be had on how we deal with reimbursement issues going forward.”The city’s costly responsibility will not end on Inauguration Day. Trump’s wife Melania and son Barron are expected to remain in New York until the end of the school year at least, and the president-elect has indicated that he will frequently return to Trump Tower even after moving to the White House.De Blasio ― who vocally opposed Trump’s candidacy, calling him “a blowhard” and “dangerous” ― met with the president-elect at Trump Tower a week after the election. He described the meeting as cordial, but said he told Trump that “sending a message of unity is crucial” and “tried to express to him how much fear there is” regarding some of Trump’s most prominent campaign proposals, including banning Muslim immigration and deporting 11 million undocumented immigrants.“We need to give assurance that the rights of all New Yorkers and all Americans will be respected,” de Blasio said."

Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) sitting atop the House Freedom Caucus, members of the conservative group elected Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) Monday night to serve as the new chairman.In the basement of Tortilla Coast ― a Capitol Hill watering hole where the group used to meet until they started going to a local Chinese restaurant, which recently had a fire ― members unanimously elected Meadows to serve as the new chairman after Jordan declined to serve a third term.The Freedom Caucus chairman was originally supposed to serve just one year, but members felt last November that they would be better served with some continuity.“We’re going to continue to work on the success that Jim Jordan laid down before us,” Meadows told The Huffington Post Monday night, mentioning that Jordan would now serve as “chairman emeritus.”Meadows did say he expected the Freedom Caucus to take a more “policy driven” approach this year, and that the group expected to hire a new policy director soon ― a position that has been vacant since the first policy director, Justin Ouimette, moved up to fill a vacancy as the HFC’s executive director.Meadows, a Republican entering his third term, is famous in conservative circles for being the member who, in 2015, introduced a motion to vacate the chair against former Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio). While Boehner ultimately left on his own, Meadows’s resolution helped push the speaker out the door.Meadows also temporarily lost his position chairing the Subcommittee on Government Operations after he voted against a rule on trade legislation, before Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) and other GOP leaders realized they could face significant blowback if they didn’t reinstate him.Meadows is known among Republican colleagues for his personal friendliness, despite being a hardline conservative.That popularity and those right-wing credentials also played a part in Meadows establishing a cozy relationship with President-elect Donald Trump.

Lessig is heading a new project to give free legal counsel to faithless electors. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/584724c61800002d00e413c3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― A new organization is offering pro bono legal assistance to any Electoral College member who decides to break with the will of the people in his or her state, in hopes of derailing President-elect Donald Trump before he is sworn in.The vote to determine who will become president is set to take place on Dec. 19. Christopher Suprun, a paramedic who lives in Texas and is one of the 538 members of the Electoral College, announced this week that he will not cast his vote for the president-elect. Larry Lessig, a Harvard Law School professor heading the project, told The Huffington Post that the law firm Durie Tangri handles intake and may wind up representing Suprun. Durie Tangri generally plans to offer confidential advice to anonymous electors, but Lessing said Suprun’s case was different. “He came to us just as he published his piece in the Times,” he said. “Our assumption is we’re talking to people who want to be anonymous, so he’s an exception. The whole community is going to step in and do what they can to help him.”Lessig, who has been a prolific online fundraiser in the past, said his group is raising funds in addition to counting on some substantial early commitments.“The motivation was the recognition that there were going to be a lot of electors who were considering what we believe is their constitutional right, to vote their conscience. Whether it makes sense to do it depends on who else is doing it,” Lessig said, adding that Durie Tangri would be willing to tell electors how many other electors had committed to voting against Trump. The law firm also plans to partner with groups doing work on the ground.Trump needs 270 electors to support him when they gather in state capitals around the country later this month. He won enough states to give him the support of 306, so anti-Trump forces need to persuade 36 more electors. That effort is underway, with Ohio Gov. John Kasich being named as a potential alternative. Trump annihilated Kasich in the Republican primary. The Electoral College itself is weighted toward conservative, rural areas of the country. Each state is granted a number of electors that equals how many senators they have plus how many House representatives they have. But senators are not apportioned by population ― rather, each state gets two. That means California, which has a population nearly 70 times larger than that of Wyoming, has only 18.3 times as many electors ― 55 to 3. Trump’s Electoral College win, though, was sizable enough that it would survive readjusting for population, although it would be much narrower. It would not survive, however, if the election were decided by the popular vote, which Clinton currently leads by more than 2.5 million.(A coalition of public interest groups is calling for a fix to the Electoral College with a massive petition, which you can find here.)The American system of government was established to be reflective of the will of population, but with a series of buffers to guard against mob rule. A myriad of layers were put between the people and the outcome of elections. Until a constitutional amendment, senators were elected not by a statewide vote, but by state legislatures. And up until fairly recently, parties chose presidential nominees at a convention without primaries or caucuses playing a significant role. The Iowa caucus, which feels like something created by the Founding Fathers, didn’t start until 1972. Over the years, the system has extended the franchise from white, male property owners to all citizens older than 18 (except, importantly, convicted felons in many states).Some states bind electors to vote for the candidate their state chose, but others only require a pledge. Lessig said the state laws that set up a legal requirement are clearly unconstitutional, citing the controlling 1952 Supreme Court case Ray v. Blair. “No one faithful to our history can deny that the plan originally contemplated, what is implicit in its text, that electors would be free agents, to exercise an independent and nonpartisan judgment as to the men best qualified for the Nation’s highest offices,” Justice Robert Jackson wrote in that case.That doesn’t mean it can be a flimsy reason, Lessig said. “If you’re an elector, you have to give a moral justification for deviating from a pledge you made. There has to be an overwhelmingly strong reason,” he said.Sign up here to get Ryan Grim’s newsletter, Bad News, in your inbox."

A portion of the bill allocates $1.8 billion toward Biden’s “cancer moonshot” initiative, which he made a priority after Beau died of brain cancer last year.As a gesture to Biden, their former Senate colleague, Senate leaders dedicated the provision to Beau.“Doing this for Beau only furthers the effect that this man, the presiding officer, has had on the country,” Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said on the Senate floor. “And I am grateful to the Republican leader for allowing me to co-sponsor this important amendment, changing the name of this bill to the Beau Biden Memorial Moonshot.”Read more about the 21st Century Cures Act here.The bill, which also includes funding to combat the opioid epidemic, passed overwhelmingly and now heads to the White House for President Barack Obama’s signature.Speaking to reporters after the vote, Biden fielded questions about his future and seemingly left the door open to a presidential run in 2020.“Yeah, I am,” Biden said. “I’m going to run in 2020.”“For what?” a reporter asked.“For president,” he replied. “What the hell, man, anyway.”When asked to clarify, he backtracked a bit.“I’m not committing not to run,” he said. “I’m not committing to anything.

Popovich was speaking at the Carver Community Center in San Antonio. In the crowd was an audience made up of 250 students from a local high school, as well as many members of the local community and the Spurs organization, players included. Onstage with him was Harvard professor Cornel West and discussion moderator Dave Zirin of The Nation. Popovich and West took turns at the event taking questions from students in the crowd, but from them all, Popovich’s answer to one child’s question in particular stood out: Are the Spurs going to win the championship? “Win the championship? I don’t know, but it’s not a priority in my life,” Popovich said. “I’d be much happier if I knew that my players were going to make society better, who had good families and who took care of the people around them. I’d get more satisfaction out of that than a title.”Popovich then added, “I would love to win another championship, and we’ll work our butts off to try and do that. But we have to want more than success in our jobs. That’s why we’re here. We’re here so you’ll understand that you can overcome obstacles by being prepared and if you educate the hell out of yourself. If you become respectful, disciplined people in this world, you can fight anything. If you join with each other and you believe in yourself and each other, that’s what matters. That’s what we want to relay to you all: that we believe that about you or we wouldn’t be here.”No one with any understanding of the NBA would ever doubt Popovich’s passion for the game of basketball. He is the gold standard among modern NBA coaches, owner of five championships and nineteen straight winning seasons.But that he is so willing to say he would prefer his players be good people first and foremost says something even more about Popovich than any of his accolades. It says he is a good person, too. "
46,POLITICS,Orange County Sheriff's Deputies' Once-Secret Log On Jail Informants Reveals Rampant Misconduct,Matt Ferner,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/orange-country-sheriff-deputies-jail-informant_us_5845d6e6e4b02f60b0246c93,The deputies' notes reveal deeply disturbing and unconstitutional behavior by members of law enforcement in county jails.,2016-12-06,A jailhouse informant scandal has been rocking Orange County for about three years.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58460bf9170000620fe7df1a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"LOS ANGELES ― An Orange County Superior Court judge released a trove of notes from a once-secret document kept by sheriff’s deputies detailing their involvement in a tainted informant program that has allegedly violated the rights of numerous defendants for years. The behavior of prosecutors and members of law enforcement described in the log raises significant questions about decades’ worth of criminal convictions in Orange County.The 242 pages of notes, made public for the first time Monday by Judge Thomas Goethals, reveal the inner workings of the county’s infamous informant program, and appears to contradict testimony given by some deputies who had previously denied knowledge of working with informants. The notes also describe deputies’ recruitment and utilization of informants; destruction and falsifying of documents; collaboration with prosecutors and other local law enforcement agencies while operating “capers” to glean further evidence from inmates; and other unconstitutional scams they used to trick inmates into confessing to crimes.The pages represent just a fraction of the total 1,157-page database, still largely under seal, which was in use between 2008 and 2013 and maintained by sheriff’s deputies who work in a branch of the department called “special handling,” which specifically deals with inmates and jail informants.The log contains multiple entries from two deputies, William Grover and Ben Garcia, who testified during special evidentiary hearings on jailhouse informants heard in the case of Scott Dekraai. Dekraai has pleaded guilty to killing his ex-wife and seven other people at a Seal Beach hair salon in 2011, and is awaiting a penalty phase of his case. Another deputy who also testified during Dekraai proceedings, Seth Tunstall, is not the author of any entries but is referenced in several. In a previous ruling, Goethals called out Tunstall and Garcia for having “either intentionally lied or willfully withheld information” during their testimony in the Dekraai case. Their log entries profoundly contradict their testimony on jail informants.While Goethals did not specifically call out Grover, there are numerous entries by the deputy in the log that reveal a deep level of understanding and involvement with informants, working with them in the jail and interviewing them. This stands in stark contrast to his 2014 testimony, when he said, “I don’t work with informants. I rarely work with informants. And to be honest with you, I try and avoid jailhouse informants.”For Dekraai and his legal team, though, the biggest bombshell may be an entry showing that Grover had a secret meeting with the informant Fernando Perez ― just two days before Perez claimed to have received a confession from Dekraai. While Grover testified that he only “heard” Perez was an informant, the deputy documents numerous meetings with Perez within the log. Tunstall, who admitted to cultivating and developing confidential informants in the jail at one point only to later disavow those statements by claiming he used the “wrong” words, is revealed in the log to handle informants with such mastery that his fellow deputies requested that he “teach [the deputies] what it takes to cultivate a [confidential informant] on the street and walk us through all the paperwork needed for such.” Garcia and Grover both make separate entries that seem to describe the “shredding” of “old” documents related to the special handling unit. In another entry, Grover describes a “purge” that he, Garcia and another deputy did of old files in a desk drawer.The log also contains an entry describing a meeting between various sheriff’s deputies who discuss that they will stop using the special handling log and indicating the existence of a newer log ― one that has yet to be turned over ― that the deputies describe is for “important information sharing.” That meeting took place eight days before the last entry was made in the special handling log, on Jan. 31, 2013.All three deputies remain employed by OCSD, department spokesman Lt. Mark Stichter told The Huffington Post. Stichter declined to comment on whether the deputies have faced any discipline, however, he told the Los Angeles Times in October that the deputies had not been penalized.Yet nine months after the SH log first came to light, the Sheriff’s Department has still not offered its explanation as to why the database was abruptly halted in 2013, just days after Goethals issued a broad order to turn over such information in the Dekraai case. Stichter told HuffPost in August that the agency is still trying to determine why the database ended. Goethals has ordered the Sheriff’s Department to turn over the “important information sharing” document on Dec. 16 or be prepared to have deputies face questioning on the issue.Meanwhile, the Sheriff’s Department continues to deny that a formal jail informant program even exists ― despite evidence, like the 1,157-page log, that would seemingly undermine such denials.The release of the log pages comes less than two weeks after a California appeals court affirmed Goethals’ 2015 decision to eject the entire Orange County District Attorney’s Office from the Dekraai case over his findings of significant misconduct in their use of jailhouse informants.Assistant Public Defender Scott Sanders should have received a copy of the log years ago, when a court ordered the OCSD to turn over just this kind of material. Indeed, Goethals blasted Sheriff Sandra Hutchens in court for months over the lengthy delay in turning over the log. Sanders has been arguing for years that a tainted snitch network in county jails has existed in secret for decades ― and the release of the log pages significantly bolsters that argument. In a series of blockbuster motions, the defense attorney has gone on to unearth damning evidence pointing to the program’s existence, alleging that county prosecutors and police have violated multiple defendants’ rights by illegally obtaining and sometimes withholding evidence received from jail informants. His discoveries have led to multiple murder cases in the county unraveling, even resulting in some accused murderers having their sentences vacated. Law enforcement authorities use informants to help bolster a case — a tactic that’s perfectly legal, even when the snitch receives something in exchange. But Sanders alleges that in some Orange County cases, informants held recorded and unrecorded conversations with inmates who were already represented by lawyers, which violates an inmate’s right to counsel. Prosecutors then allegedly took damning evidence gathered by the informants and presented it in court, while withholding evidence that could have been beneficial to the defense — which is a violation of a defendant’s right to due process. On Monday, Hutchens released a statement outlining the steps that OCSD has taken since the discovery of the log, including the disbanding of the special handling unit and the formation of a new unit with similar responsibilities called the custody intelligence unit, which Hutchens promises is not a “reincarnation” of the dissolved unit.It remains unclear exactly how many cases in the county may have been affected by tainted informant evidence, but Sanders has argued that every case involving a jailhouse informant in Orange County over the last three decades deserves to be re-examined."

Each cup will contain 10 milligrams of the marijuana chemical THC for recreational users and up to 50 milligrams for people who need it for medical reasons, plus a jolt of “West Coast Roast” coffee so you can wake and bake.The pods, which will cost $7 apiece, are designed to fit Keurig coffee brewers and will be completely compostable. So the company boasts on its website that the pods are therefore “good for you” and “good for the Earth.”“It’s an opportunity to bring together two different rituals in life,” BrewBudz Vice President Jeffry Paul told Denver’s Westword magazine.The company is due to launch sales in Nevada and Colorado in January and plans to expand to Washington, Oregon, California and Arizona by March.The product is the latest to benefit from the increasing number of states legalizing medical and recreational use of the drug. Nearly a quarter of the U.S. population now lives in a state that has legalized marijuana.Though California legalized medical marijuana 20 years ago, voters only approved it for recreational use last month. The state hopes to make $1 billion in sales tax revenues now from the pot business.The federal government still considers the drug illegal and classifies pot as a Schedule I drug alongside heroin. President Barack Obama signaled he would lay off state marijuana laws as long as certain requirements were met, such as keeping pot businesses far from schools. The Department of Justice issued guidelines for states to follow.It’s unclear how tolerant President-elect Donald Trump will be about state laws concerning marijuana. His pick for attorney general, Jeff Sessions, is strongly opposed to legalizing pot.State Treasurer John Chiang has already reached out to Trump and California’s congressional delegation for guidance on how the state should regulate finances for the industry. Banking is a problem for outlaw organizations.“Of primary concern to my office are the limits federal rules place on the cannabis industry’s ability to effectively participate in the state and nation’s banking system,” Chiang wrote to Trump last week. “We have a year to develop a system that works in California and which addresses the many issues that exist as a result of the federal-state legal conflict. Uncertainty about the position of your administration creates even more of a challenge.”Chiang said this month that the conflict between state and federal governments “means a lot of businesses will be hauling around a lot of cash with no place to deposit their money and putting themselves at risk of robbery,” The Record reported.Trump has yet to comment publicly on the matter. State Attorney General Xavier Becerra told The Record that his response to Trump would depend on how much the federal government is “trying to intrude on California’s sovereignty.” "

I’d rather let them tear at my flesh than answer these ridiculous questions.”Almena rented living space to artists in Ghost Ship, although the warehouse was not coded for residential use. Several tenants told The Associated Press that they had complained about hazardous living conditions but that Almena did nothing to address them.When pressed by Lauer about those prior complaints, Almena dodged the question, instead rambling on about his dream of an artistic community.“I laid my body down there every night. We laid our bodies down there. We put our children to bed there every night,” he said. “We made music. We created art.”Hall attempted to ask about former tenant Shelley Mack, who has accused Almena of profiting off living spaces he knew were unsafe. But Almena interrupted.“I don’t want to talk about it. I don’t want to talk about me. I don’t want to talk about profiting,” he said loudly. “This is not profit. This is loss. This is a mass grave.”Lauer ended the five-minute interview as Almena refused again to discuss his own possible accountability for what happened.“I am so sorry. I’m incredibly sorry,” he said. “What do you want me to say? I’m not going to answer these questions.”It’s not just tenants who have complained about Almena. In 2015, event organizer Philippe Lewis filed for a restraining order against him after a verbal dispute allegedly descended into physical violence. According to NBC Bay Area, Lewis had rented the warehouse for a New Year’s Eve concert. Following the event, he said that he and another organizer were assaulted by Almena over cleanup costs.Rescue workers continued to search for bodies and remove debris from the ruins of the warehouse on Tuesday.

Tuesday’s rulings are subject to appeal, and death sentences must go to the king for ratification.Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi denied that any Iranian spying had occurred in Saudi Arabia. “Such accusations are baseless and serve political motives,” he was quoted as saying by the semi-official Tasnim news agency.The trial was the first in recent memory in which Saudi citizens were accused of spying. It came at a time of increasing struggle between Saudi Arabia, the regional Sunni Muslim powerhouse, and Iran, a non-Arab Shi’ite theocracy, for influence in the Middle East.In January, Saudi Arabia executed a prominent Shi’ite cleric convicted of involvement in the killing of policemen, prompting protesters to storm the Saudi Embassy in Tehran. Riyadh then broke off diplomatic relations.Many of the 32 defendants were former employees of the Saudi defense and interior ministries, Saudi media said. They were accused of setting up a spy ring and passing sensitive military and security information to Iran in an effort to sabotage Saudi economic interests, undermine community cohesion and incite sectarian strife.The charges included supporting protests in the Shi’ite-majority region of Qatif in Eastern Province, recruiting others for espionage, sending encrypted reports to Iranian intelligence via email and committing high treason against the king.Among those arrested in 2013 were an elderly university professor, a pediatrician, a banker and two clerics.Most were from al-Ahsa, a mixed Shi’ite and Sunni region that is home to around half the members of the kingdom’s minority Shi’ite community.Saudi Arabia has blamed sporadic unrest among Shi’ites in Qatif on Iran, but never publicly presented evidence of a direct link between Tehran and those who took part in protests between 2011 and 2013. The Islamic Republic denies any involvement.Shi’ites in Eastern Province say they face persistent discrimination affecting their ability to work, study and worship freely - accusations denied by Saudi authorities.

Her decision last year to open Germany’s doors to some 1 million migrants sapped some grassroots support and has dented the CDU’s poll ratings.Merkel’s lowest winning score in election as chairwoman was 88.4 percent in 2004.

Prescribing narcotics and opioids for chronic pain was another treatment of limited value, according to 7.3 percent of physicians surveyed.“We need to start concentrating on high-value care,” said lead study author Dr. Amir Qaseem, vice president of clinical policy and chair of the high value care task force for the American College of Physicians.This isn’t just about money.“The value of any intervention is when you look at the benefits and harms and cost together,” Qaseem said in a telephone interview.“For example, HIV treatment is very expensive but that doesn’t mean it’s low value because it’s very effective,” Qaseem added. “Antibiotics can be very cheap but they can be low value because they often aren’t necessary.”His team’s findings, from an online survey completed by 1,582 doctors, were published online December 5th in Annals of Internal Medicine.Participants were asked to identify the two treatments they most often observed being used for patients that were unlikely to offer high value.Overuse of aggressive care in patients with limited life expectancy was identified as a problem by 8.6 percent of participants, making it second only to overuse of antibiotics.This mostly included life-support measures near the end of life such as feeding tubes, intubation and resuscitation; treatments to prevent long-term complications in patients with little time left to live, such as dialysis or invasive heart procedures; and chemotherapy for patients with advanced or metastatic cancer.About 5 percent of doctors also identified overuse of dietary supplements including vitamin D, niacin, fish oil, calcium, multivitamins and folic acid.Roughly 5 percent of doctors also cited overuse of statins and other cholesterol-lowering medications in the elderly or to prevent health problems.Other low-value interventions cited in the survey include invasive cardiac procedures, diabetes treatments other than the drug metformin, and overuse of bisphosphonates to treat osteoporosis, and over-managed or inappropriately controlled blood pressure.One limitation of the study is its cross-sectional design and self-reported survey data, which makes it impossible to assess how closely the results mirror actual overuse of low value interventions in the real world, the authors note.Even so, the results suggest that general internists are aware of clinical guidelines and on board with the concept of avoiding low-value care, said Dr. David Levine, a researcher at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston who wasn’t involved in the study.“Clinicians who stray from guidelines may, or may not, have good reasons for doing so,” Levine said by email. “The guidelines may not be applicable to the patient in front of them, or they may not realize the newest recommendations now counsel against a treatment or procedure they learned in medical school.”Patients shouldn’t be shy about questioning doctors, said Dr. Sharon Levine, executive vice president of The Permanente Federation at Kaiser Permanente in California.“Every one of us should feel comfortable asking any one of a series of questions when a physician proposes a therapy,” said Levine, who wasn’t involved in the study. She listed them: “Why are you recommending this treatment? What are the potential risks associated with it, and what is the likely benefit? Are there other approaches you considered, including no treatment? And what would be the risks and benefits compared to what you are recommending? What should I look for in terms of side effects or adverse reactions?”“These types of questions promote a healthy dialogue about the probability that a recommended therapy will result in an outcome that is high value for the patient,” Levine added by email."

The 23-year-old was fielding questions at a press conference ahead of this week’s Omega Dubai Ladies Classic, a Ladies European Tour played in the Middle East, when a reporter asked her a poignant question.“You had a difficult time after last year. How bad was the bullying?” the reporter asked Spiranac. According to ESPN and Golf Digest, the reporter was referring to the harassment and cyberbullying Spiranac faced after shooting 77-79 in her professional debut and subsequently missing the cut in a Ladies European Tour event last year. The young golfer has also amassed a large social media following with over 800,000 followers on Instagram and 100,000 on Twitter. Spiranac described the online comments she receives on a daily basis as “extremely cruel,” adding that she had to take about three weeks off from the internet after last year’s event. “They attack not only me, but my parents, my family, my friends. They say I’m a disgrace to golf,” Spiranac said, referring to mean commenters. “I still get those comments and I still deal with it every day.”The 23-year-old said commenters have told her the world would be better off without her, called her “promiscuous” and even threatened her life.Spiranac continued:I think it’s really important for people to see how much it does affect me and the things they call me, I feel like I was raised right by my parents and for them to attack my parents and attack what I’m doing it’s really difficult. I struggled with a lot of depression after it. As a 22-year-old you feel like you’re not worth anything, you feel worthless.... If I can share my story, and I’m OK with being emotional about it and I’m OK with expressing what happened to me, because people don’t realize how hard it really was on me and how bad it really does get. She added that her performance in the event this week doesn’t matter ― speaking up about online bullying does.“It doesn’t matter how I play this week, it really doesn’t,” Spiranac said. “But the fact that I’m here and I’m sharing my story, it hopefully can save someone’s life. I think that’s so much more important than if I make the cut or miss the cut.”Spiranac’s powerful and emotional sentiment was met with applause from the room of reporters. We’re applauding you as well, Paige. "
54,POLITICS,Supreme Court Wants To Know How Much Race And Politics Can Mix In Gerrymandering,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-gerrymander_us_5845b2fce4b028b323388fb5,The justices will have a hard time drawing a line that makes everyone happy.,2016-12-06,The Supreme Court heard two related cases on racial gerrymandering Monday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5845b424120000dd00eed959.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Redistricting is far from the sexiest thing on the Supreme Court’s docket, but the way the justices shape rules around it could mean life or death for the politics of a state or its parties.For two hours on Monday, the high court struggled with two related cases ― one from Virginia and another from North Carolina ― touching on what’s likely the toughest and most controversial area of redistricting law: racial gerrymandering, or the practice of taking race into account when redrawing state legislative and congressional maps.The Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection places stringent limits on how much states may consider race when updating district lines. But there’s also the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which requires states to use race to some degree when drawing legislative maps, so as to ensure that minority voters have an opportunity to elect candidates of their choice.It’s a Catch-22, and the Supreme Court for decades has grappled with creating tests that provide just the right balance for state legislatures to follow. The last time the court tried to do that, in a 2014 Alabama case, the justices split sharply along ideological lines, and even that decision’s author, Justice Stephen Breyer, suggested Monday there may be more work to be done in this area.“That is the decision of the court. I had thought that having done that, there would be lots of lower courts that would rely on that decision,” Breyer said about his own ruling, which noted that states ought to have a “strong basis in evidence” when factoring race in redistricting decisions. “Is it a good idea now suddenly to change and go to some different test?”The court’s apparent confusion is complicated further when states that are sued for engaging in aggressive racial gerrymandering ― for example, packing black and Latino voters in specific districts in such a way that it dilutes their voting power elsewhere ― say they’re being partisan about the process, not racially discriminatory.Noting that race is “the evil the Constitution is intended to avoid,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor crystallized the difficulty of separating racial considerations from mere political ones in the context of redistricting.“See, your way is to say that state legislatures go out and always say it’s politics, because it’s real easy to say politics, even though there’s a lot of direct evidence that it really was race,” Sotomayor said to Paul Clement, the lawyer representing both states. “The issue is, are the state legislators prohibited from using race predominantly? And if they are and the proof is they have, then they should go back to the drawing board and do it without it.”The Virginia case asks the justices to determine whether the state’s 2011 House of Delegates map, which contains 12 legislative districts where African-Americans make up 55 percent of the voting-age population, is unconstitutional because it deliberately packs too many black voters in those districts, reducing their clout elsewhere.“Isn’t there something a bit strange about this kind of rule?” Justice Elena Kagan asked, referring to the 55-percent cutoff. “And it’s not to say that this kind of rule is the end all and be all ... It sort of defies belief you could pick a number and say that applies with respect to every majority-minority district.”More than 20 years ago, the Supreme Court ruled that if a state legislature used race as the “predominant” factor in its redistricting decisions, then its plans violate the Constitution. But here Virginia insists that race was merely a factor motivating what was otherwise a “bipartisan success story” that allowed minority voters to pick candidates of their choosing.“The reason that, in this area uniquely, the court allows race to be considered is in part because the Voting Rights Act makes the consideration of race absolutely necessary,” Clement said.Justice Samuel Alito acknowledged that reconciling these principles is “very, very complicated,” signaling that no matter how the court rules ― and what legislatures do in response to whatever the new rules are ― it will undoubtedly be “an invitation for litigation” in this area.The other case, from North Carolina, finds the embattled state ― which just Monday saw Gov. Pat McCrory (R) concede the election ― asking the Supreme Court to uphold two congressional districts that are very familiar to the justices: Congressional District 1 and Congressional District 12.Both maps have landed before the justices in prior disputes, and after the 2010 census ― and the election of Barack Obama in 2008 ― the North Carolina legislature set out to redraw them with an eye toward putting a higher percentage of minority voters in those districts.Democratic super-lawyer Marc Elias ― who has been busy in recent months with voter suppression lawsuits, voter ID challenges and post-election recount monitoring ― said this was precisely the kind of “political” move that the Constitution doesn’t allow.“The harm is in using race as the predominant factor,” he told the court Monday. “There is no constitutional right to political gerrymandering that has to be protected. What has to be protected is voters’ rights.”Because the line between race and politics is a fine one ― and the Supreme Court has yet to define it with precision ― both the Virginia and the North Carolina cases are likely headed for a photographic finish. And to get there, the court may very well try to strike a balance between respecting voting rights and giving states their due deference.“It’s not just the states’ interest,” Breyer said. “It’s the constitutional interest in seeing that minorities have representation in reality in the legislatures.”"

The Army is still deciding whether or not to exact further punishment upon Broadwell, currently a reserve major, an official confirmed to The Huffington Post, citing a detailed article in The Hill.The clear difference in their situations is just the latest shameful chapter in the Petraeus scandal, at every turn a case study in the ways women and men are treated differently in the media and in culture ― as well as by the incoming Trump administration. As is now widely known, Petraeus shared highly classified information with Broadwell while he was running the CIA ― even the names of undercover agents. It was 2011, she was writing a book about him as part of her doctoral work at Harvard and the two, both married, were having an affair. Broadwell was an Army reserve major and an intelligence officer.The Army quickly demoted Broadwell, rescinding a promotion to Lt. Colonel and taking away her security clearance, but has so far declined to accept the resignation she offered up this summer. The FBI did not charge her; Broadwell’s lawyer argued that she was protected because she viewed the secret information while working in the role of an author/journalist. (The classified bits never made it into the book.)Petraeus apologized publicly, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of mishandling classified information, paid $100,000 and received two years of probation. He’s about halfway through it now. But unlike Broadwell, Petraeus gets to keep his rank ― and the $220,000 annual pension that comes with it. (He was running the CIA and retired from the military when all this went down.)Earlier this year, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter said his department would not demote Petraeus. This move came after Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) both spoke up in Petraeus’ defense.While some senators said they’d have a difficult time approving Petraeus for an administration position ― he’s just one of many contestants in Trump’s “Apprentice: Cabinet Edition” ― McCain and Graham have publicly said he’d be a great pick. So, although he’d have to let his probation officer know about any Cabinet appointment, the general is moving on.Neither senator responded to a request for comment from The Huffington Post on Broadwell’s situation. The military, meanwhile, is weighing further consequences for Broadwell ― specifically for her role in mishandling classified information and for allegedly sending threatening emails to a friend of Petraeus in 2012, right before the scandal broke. The official would not say what kinds of actions the military is considering, but defended the differential treatment by saying that the FBI had already exacted its punishment on Petraeus, but Broadwell hasn’t been punished. (While it’s true that the FBI did not charge Broadwell, recall that she has lost her rank and security clearance and isn’t being allowed to retire.)It’s hard to begrudge Petraeus his second act; he’s a widely respected general with a long and storied history. But his stellar character and background has been noted throughout the scandal. Broadwell, meanwhile, has been characterized as a “mistress,” a demeaning word for which there is no male equivalent. She’s been accused of bringing a man down and destroying his career because he was forced to give in to temptation; her physical appearance was detailed and dissected. It was a pathetic biblical storyline in which men are innocents in the garden and devilish women are everywhere, dangling forbidden apples in their faces.Broadwell has degrees from several prestigious universities and a stellar career history of her own. Yet she has had trouble getting work because of this scandal, The New York Times reported earlier this year. As if to reinforce this cruel double standard, the Times placed its lengthy and substantive profile on Broadwell in the paper’s Style section, which often features stories on notable women that have little to do with fashion.Imagine a profile of Petraeus there.Undaunted, Broadwell has founded a nonprofit, Think Broader. Its mission is to highlight sexual discrimination in the media ― dropping the use of “mistress,” for example ― and to share data on how many male versus female experts reporters cite. Recently, the group teamed up with Sheryl Sandberg’s women’s nonprofit Lean In to produce a video drawing more attention to women in the military. Broadwell declined to publicly discuss her current situation with HuffPost, citing its ongoing nature. But with Petraeus so often in the news lately, she did tweet about it. “Since everyone is asking, I’d consider accepting Ambassador-at-large for Global Women’s Equality if asked,” she wrote, alongside an image that said “gender equality.” In other words, if he can return to public service, so can I. Of course, Petraeus has had more luck in the job market; he is a partner at private equity firm KKR and advises the White House.“Five years ago, I made a serious mistake. I acknowledged it, I apologized for it, I paid a very heavy price for it, and I’ve learned from it,” Petraeus said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” a TV appearance widely construed as his effort to convince Trump to give him the State role.Several people have already pointed out that Trump is considering a top job for a man who knowingly shared classified information after spending months calling his opponent Hillary Clinton “crooked” for mishandling classified information. It’s unsurprising that Trump would hold a man and a woman to different standards, exhibiting more empathy for Petraeus. It may be that Trump thinks men are simply better than women.“Donald [Trump] told me that he thought that men were better than women— especially in this field — but that a good woman was better than ten good men,” Barbara Res, who worked as an executive in the Trump organization for 12 years, told Frontline. “I think he believed that women had to prove themselves more than men, so a good woman would work harder.”We all expect this from Trump, but he’s hardly the only one holding men and women to different standards. Broadly speaking, men get more leeway to screw up ― particularly if the screwing up involves an indiscretion with a woman. Obviously, Trump’s OK with that. His inner circle is essentially the Third Wives Club ― Steve Bannon, Newt Gingrich, Rudy Giuliani. These guys have had less-than pristine romantic lives, to say the least. And that’s fine. The problem is when the rules are different for women. "

His inner circle is essentially the Third Wives Club ― Steve Bannon, Newt Gingrich, Rudy Giuliani. These guys have had less-than pristine romantic lives, to say the least. And that’s fine. The problem is when the rules are different for women. "

He even wants to “cancel” the Paris Climate Agreement, which President Barack Obama helped broker, because he thinks it’s bad for business.But fretting about the outcome of the November presidential election isn’t doing the planet any favors, cautions former vice-president Al Gore.Gore said Monday “there is no time to despair,” given we’re inching closer to the global temperature increase of 2 degrees Celsius ― which scientists warn the world must avoid to stave off the worst effects of climate change.“We don’t have time to lick our wounds, to hope for a different election outcome,” he told the Guardian.Gore, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 for his environmental work, said climate activism has never been “more important.” “I’m encouraged that there are groups that are digging in to work even harder. Those groups working in the courts are even more important now; those organizing on campuses are even more important now,” he said. “We have to win this struggle and we will win it; the only question is how fast we win. But more damage is baked into the climate system every day, so it’s a race against time.” Earlier on Monday, Gore met with the president-elect and his daughter Ivanka Trump to discuss “climate issues” at Trump Tower in New York City. “I had a lengthy and very productive session with the president-elect,” Gore told reporters following the meeting. “It was a sincere search for areas of common ground. I found it an extremely interesting conversation, and to be continued.”Gore, who campaigned for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, has spoken out against Trump’s climate views in the past. In October, he warned that Trump would “take us towards a climate catastrophe” if elected president."

Though the late artist garnered four nominations, including Best Rock Song and Best Alternative Music Album, some were let down when he wasn’t nominated for Album of the Year.“Ambitious and experimental, Bowie’s ‘Blackstar’ was warmly received by critics,” USA Today’s Maeve McDermott wrote, “While Bowie is remembered with a posthumous nomination for best alternative music album, ‘Blackstar’ didn’t earn an Album of the Year nod, with its lead single ‘Lazarus’ absent from the main song categories.” Fans also expressed their disappointment on Twitter: Meanwhile, others were upset Prince’s last album, “Hit n Run Phase Two,” was only nominated in the Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical category.Still, McDermott pointed out the album “is absent from the R&B categories Prince has won in the past.” However, Vulture’s Dee Lockett speculated that the Grammys might honor Prince with a posthumous Lifetime Achievement Award, as the show did for Michael Jackson a year after his death. Kanye West cleaned up with a total of eight nominations, but his latest album, “The Life of Pablo,” was only nominated for rap categories at the awards show.Despite his nods in the Best Rap/Sung Performance, Best Rap Album and two nominations in Best Rap Song, we’re sure Yeezy will have something to say about missing Album of the Year. Still, he’s not completely out of the running there, as Ye has a producing credit on Drake’s “Views,” which is up for the night’s biggest award. Selena Gomez fans also weren’t pleased the pop star was completely shut out of the Grammy nominations, considering the success of her hits “Hands to Myself” and “Same Old Love.”Of course, her loyal Selenators took over Twitter to express their anger.Those who weren’t so devoted to Gomez had no problem telling fans why she didn’t get nominated. The Chainsmokers, who also enjoyed immense success at the top of the charts with their smash hit, “Closer” ft. Halsey, were nominated for a few categories, but the duo is notably absent from the Song of the Year and Record of the Year categories.According to most of social media, many felt the duo shouldn’t have been nominated at all.

My heart stopped, my mind raced, shivers went up my spine; I was shocked. I knew her voice, and I knew that this wasn’t good news.Just after our daughter Zeesy’s first birthday, she suffered her first grand mal seizure. Optimism is ingrained in our Chassidic culture, so we were extremely hopeful that this would pass, as it does for many infants, but time didn’t heal our Zeesy. While she grew in so many ways over the next three years, she struggled with so much that other children her age take for granted. Walking, potty training, speaking, sleeping through the night, were all challenging for our baby, but most of all, she was having intolerable meltdowns that by all standards were more like semi-seizures or blackouts.Our family’s remarkable pediatrician, Dr. Sheila Idzerda, worked tirelessly to evaluate Zeesy’s condition, but with no permanent pediatric neurologist in Montana at that time, we were at a loss. In November of 2014, with the help of dear friends, we discovered a one-of-a-kind pediatric neurology center in New Jersey and secured a three-day, total evaluation appointment for Zeesy. Chavie traveled to the Garden State, while I held down the fort with the other two children in Bozeman. During their visit, there were so much the specialists discovered about Zeesy, so much we wished we would have known years earlier. Yet, such is the world of child development; it can take time to figure it all out. In my heart of hearts, I was still hoping it would be “nothing”, or at least an “easy fix”, but that wasn’t in the cards for us.Chavie called again from Jersey that evening and started using terms like “genetic disorder” and “genetic testing”; I didn’t know what exactly it meant but I felt like I was punched in the gut. My daughter, our second child, now has special needs? As Chavie spoke, I was in a daze, not fully grasping, or even hearing, everything Chavie was sharing, but I got the point: No cure. Very rare condition. Our life is about to change forever.After returning home, Zeesy underwent genetic testing at Shodair Children’s Hospital in Helena and a spinal tap in Billings. The result of it all was conclusive: Zeesy has Glut-1: “Glucose Transporter Type 1 Deficiency Syndrome is a genetic disorder that impairs brain metabolism. Glucose isn’t transported properly into the brain, leaving it starving for the energy it needs to grow and function.Like most parents, the love Chavie and I have for our children is immeasurable. Adopting a child creates a bond between parent and child that is truly indescribable. Yet, to be frank, I never wanted or planned to raise a special needs child. When asked “do you want to adopt a child with special needs”? I’d say “I admire those that are, but it’s not something I’m up to”. Yet, here I was, raising a child with a very rare disorder only found in five hundred people worldwide. I wasn’t raising Zeesy because I thought I was cut out for it; I was doing it because G-d knew that Chavie and I were.I’m not a perfect parent, not by any stretch of the imagination. I struggle. I strive to be calm and thoughtful 24/7, but don’t always succeed. Yet, Zeesy has made me a different dad. I have more patience, more understanding, more compassion, more strength and more love. I am not only a better father to Zeesy and her siblings, but I am a better husband, better rabbi and, I believe, a better human being because of our Zeesy. I am less judgmental of other parents, I’m more reverent of parents dealing so well with their special children and I am more accepting of life’s curve balls than ever before.Zeesy revealed a part of me that I never knew existed.While there is still no cure for Glut-1, there is a remedy for development: the ketogenic diet. Unlike, a health or body image diet, this is lifesaving. Chavie, with boundless patience and love, prepares Zeesy’s measured meals, so that her delicate brain receives an alternate source of energy, starving it from the normal glucose based energy and giving it high fat energy. In the eighteen months since Zeesy started this diet, she has grown and developed exponentially, but the workload is enormous. Zeesy attends Bozeman Montessori school, where the education is incredible, she’s treated with occupational and physical therapy, and takes multiple medications and vitamins for her wellbeing. So, while waiting for the miracle pill, she’s certainly going places. Chavie and I look at each other every day and thank G-d for Zeesy. Zeesy has taught us that together we can persevere and thrive for her, for her siblings, for ourselves and for the world around us.Special parents are gifted with special children!"

I just couldn’t get going on the two beautiful coffee table books I was going to write about. There was something bubbling just below the surface and it took me until this morning to tap into it. This blog is about art, literature, creativity and the gentle souls who are called to a life in the arts -- people whose contributions generally go unrewarded, unrecognized, and are even disparaged or ridiculed. Thirty-six (and counting) of those souls perished this week in the horrific tragedy of the Oakland Ghost Ship Fire. Often branded as flakes, losers or slackers, these are courageous people who turn their backs on corporate life, the slow death that a 9-5 job represents to them and the comforts that a regular paycheck bring. They live authentic lives and sacrifice greatly to do so. Instead of being rewarded for their bravery and the work that enhances all of our lives, they are forced to live marginally, often in dangerous environments.I’ve never been to the Ghost Ship and I don’t know anyone who has perished or is missing, but I have been one of them, know many like them, and have spent time in those environments. The Ghost Ship was a rich labyrinth of repurposed furniture, art, kilims, hanging lanterns, speakers, guitars, clocks, turntables, old pianos and pipe organs, scrap wood railings, impromptu sleeping lofts and intimate seating areas, ideal for long languorous conversation – in short, a greenhouse for creativity.This should not have been a place where so much vibrant young life was extinguished.Click here to see photographs of the Oakland Ghost Ship before the fire.Click here to donate to the Fire Relief Fund for Victims of Ghost Ship Fire.We all know, or should know, the role that artists play in revitalizing down-trodden neighborhoods. Artists go to those neighborhoods because it’s the only way they can afford to live and do the work they are compelled to do. After much hard work and sacrifice by artists, the neighborhoods suddenly become fashionable. Shops, restaurants and hipsters follow -- and inevitably the artists who breathed new life into these neighborhoods are forced out in search of affordable and often unsafe digs.Case in point is the Santa Fe Art Colony in Downtown LA. Funded by the Community Reinvestment Act, the Colony has provided rent-restricted live/work space to artists for 30 years in what was an industrial no-man’s-land. Now the area is booming with high-end art galleries, shops, restaurants and a construction boom. Sadly, the CRA restrictions are due to end soon at the Santa Fe Colony. The rent increases will force many of the artists out.Click here to sign a Change.org petition to help save the Santa Fe Art Colony.I often felt conflicted as director of a commercial art gallery. My heart was always with the artists, and I was uncomfortable in my role as go-between with collectors. Offramp Gallery wasn’t selling art at huge prices, and most of our collectors were good people who understood the circumstances of the artists. But there were those, one in particular (you know who you are), who relished trying to get that price down another five or ten percent, even while sitting in the artist’s humble studio, oblivious, salivating at the bargain he was taking away to his new mansion in Pacific Palisades. Another way artists are being regularly exploited is by being asked to donate works for auctions. They're already living at the poverty level, and then are asked to give their work away to raise money for various causes. It should be a standard practice for artists to receive a percentage of the proceeds (kudos to organizations that are already doing this), instead of donating 100%. They aren't greedy people, they're struggling to pay the rent.Let’s support art and artists in real ways. I’m not talking about headline-making auction prices, mega-galleries and the fou-fou see-and-be-seen art fairs. Click the links above to donate and support. Go on studio tours, support lower- and mid-range galleries, try to understand what artists are doing and why they are living the way they do. They deserve better and we need to see that they get it.Send me your art-related stories and links to your causes (janechafinsblog@gmail.com) and I will report on them.Cross-posted from Jane Chafin: Art, Books, Culture"
64,WOMEN,Trump And The Comedy Of Sexual Assault,"Deni Ellis Béchard, ContributorJournalist and Award-Winning Author",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-and-the-comedy-of-sexual-assault_us_5845de51e4b0e0184289eff6,"In the month since Trump’s election, I have heard friends and acquaintances wonder how so many Americans could have voted",2016-12-06,"Republican U.S. Presidential nominee Donald Trump attends a campaign event at Briar Woods High School in Ashburn, Virginia, U.S. August 2, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/584743c61700002500e7e289.jpeg?ops=crop_0_582_4568_2425%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"In the month since Trump’s election, I have heard friends and acquaintances wonder how so many Americans could have voted for a sexual aggressor. They have attributed his victory largely to the economic struggles of white Americans and the anti-establishment vote. But little attention has been given to how media coverage of his sexual aggression passed quickly from outrage to comedy, or how that comedy might have served Trump’s candidacy. On October 7, the Access Hollywood recording revealed Trump bragging about “grabbing” women’s genitals (an act legally considered sexual assault in much of the United States). But what should have marked the beginning of a precipitous dive initiated a month of raucous mainstream comedy. The Late Show with Stephen Colbert featured jokes about Trump grabbing women by the “Billy Bush.” As these jokes were followed by laughter and applause, I found myself wondering whether we were laughing at Trump or laughing at sexual assault. In her essay, “If Rape Jokes Are Finally Funny It’s Because They’re Targeting Rape Culture,” Rebecca Solnit discusses the potential effectiveness of jokes about rape culture, made, for instance, by Amy Schumer (who has used comedy to point out men’s ignorance about rape and their general acceptance of it). However, on The Late Show, Colbert seemed less intent on shedding light on rape culture than on using sexual assault as fodder. Humor, while a tonic for the most stressful election in living memory, can have a powerful normalizing effect. Numerous studies have shown that discrimination and sexism are more easily accepted when conveyed through humor. But by laughing at a sexual aggressor who got away with it, we might actually be becoming accustomed to him as a fixture of our political landscape rather than reaffirming our outrage. Colbert even staged the appearance of Lincoln’s ghost, who sided with Trump and gave an “unabridged” version of the Gettysburg Address which included grabbing women by the “petticoats.” Had something similar been done at a frat party, with a person dressed as Lincoln and speaking like Trump at his worst, I could easily imagine the audience cheering. Just as the French filmmaker François Truffaut argued that “there’s no such thing as an anti-war film,” I tend to disagree with Solnit and Schumer, and would argue that there’s no such thing as anti-rape humor, at least not for the men in the audience. The humor makes the act seem to be more one of comedic idiocy than of willful brutality. It almost always distances us (men) from the horror and trauma of the violence.Humor was, in fact, Trump’s own best defense. When he claimed his words were simple “locker room talk,” he was speaking to millions of men who grew up making sexual and sexist jokes about women. During my teenage years, when I changed high schools frequently, and in my twenties, when I lived in many parts of rural America and did manual labor, sexist humor was common. It was common in locker rooms, on construction sites, in the automobile repair shops, in boxing and martial arts gyms, and among educated men, who exchanged their own brand of comedic stories of sexual conquest. Even though many of the stories were quite aggressive, the elicited response was always laughter. This is why Trump’s defense was so effective and the response of liberal commentators so naïve. Male writers published ostensibly reflective pieces about how Trump’s talk sounded like no locker room they’d been in. Perhaps they were describing the middle aged locker rooms of health clubs, or of career-driven professional athletes. I don’t know. But their underlying message was that they were good men and that most men didn’t talk this way. It was another instance of the liberal passion to appear good rather than to address the problem. The hashtag #NotInMyLockerRoom struck me as a not-so-distant cousin to #NotAllMen rather than as a rallying cry of outrage. It implicitly denied how prevalent and acceptable sexism actually is, and it failed to recognize that men can do more to prevent sexual assault if we spend less time insisting upon our goodness and rather reflect on how much sexism is a part of our lives. I would argue that, for many men, Trump’s defense of “locker room talk” was hardly necessary. While liberal commentators derided him, millions of men nodded in sympathy. They might have said that Trump went a little beyond the acceptable range of the stories men tell, but that vulgar sexual humor about women is part of how many men bond, come of age, and compete with each other to show who has had the most conquests. In this way, Trump appeared as the ultimate conqueror, the one who had the best stories of sexual conquest and repeatedly got away with it. His only wrongdoing in the eyes of many was getting caught. And yet, by refusing to step down and by weathering the largely for-show scorn of fellow politicians, he proved he could get away with it once again. Furthermore, the normalization of Trump’s sexual assault through mainstream comedy certainly didn’t hurt his cause among men who grew up objectifying women with jokes; they wanted to laugh at it, and they were given permission to do so.But is it possible that sexist humor might influence an election? In 2007, Dr. Thomas Ford at Western Carolina University ran two trials in which men were exposed to sexist jokes or humorous sexist depictions, as opposed to non-humorous sexism or non-sexist jokes shown to control groups. They were then asked (in the first trial) how much money they would donate to a women’s organization, and (in the second) how they would allocate funding cuts to student organizations. In both cases, the men exposed to sexist humor were less likely to donate to the women’s organizations and more likely to cut funding to women’s student organizations. Dr. Ford concluded: “The acceptance of sexist humor leads men to believe that sexist behavior falls within the bounds of social acceptability.”Though it’s hard not to wonder whether sexist humor made men less willing to support a female candidate, we can easily fathom the effect that Trump’s sexist humor—and that of the comedians whose routines turned the country itself into a locker room—had on the readiness of Americans to accept him when it was time to vote."

This is why the majority of the opposition can be described as failures, though this description is too soft given the big revolutionary tasks and developmental visions that come to mind when mentioning the term “opposition”. This failure is the main reason why the tyrannical regime still exists despite the opposition’s expectation that it would collapse soon. If we examine the reasons of this failure, we’ll find out that they can be attributed to the opposition themselves as well as to the circumstances under which they have been working. To begin with, the political line of the opposition has not been clear; and because they are being backed by different countries, they have lost the ability to take national decisions to bring the freedom and dignity to the people, as they claimed in the beginning of the revolution. They have abandoned the Syrian people to their fate amid violence and destruction. Moreover, they have been working for contradicting regional and international agendas, which are against the national interest of Syrian people.Furthermore, the absence of a democratic project, seeking money and positions contrary to people’s aims and interests, lack of political efficiency and working outside the Syrian soil are all factors that paved the way for radical groups supported by the Turkish government to militarily control a lot of regions and tear the country apart. Such opposition are valueless and can’t have any effect on the course of history due to their negative role which hinders the Syrian revolution.Although the Turkish plans and military intervention and occupation of some Syrian areas have been disclosed, this opposition continue to serve the Turkish agendas and fiercely defend them. Thus, the gap has become wider between the Syrian people and those who consider themselves the legitimate representatives of the Syrian people, like the “Syrian Coalition” and before it the “Syrian National Council” and many other groups of opposition. These groups seek their personal interests and work to execute the Turkish regime’s greed and projects; thus they are rendered disposable.Erdogan has abandoned the opposition by handing Aleppo to Russia and the regime. The opposition should have endorsed a democratic project to serve the national interest and build a new Syria for all its components. They should have truly expressed the hopes of the Syrians to have a safe homeland where people feel respected. They should have practiced what they preached to deserve the respect of the Syrian revolutionaries and lead them at this crucial stage. However, they have accepted to be cheap agents used by the “ottoman sultan” to execute his greed for expansion in Syria and legitimize Turkish occupation of Jarablus and other areas. This also applies to some Kurds, who work under the banner of the “ottoman coalition”, who have been unmasked in front of their people and who have been backing Daesh and the Turkish government against Kurdish people and all Syrian components.The founders of the democratic self-administrations are those who have defeated the terrorist organizations and will fight them wherever they exist. They represent the secular democratic opposition who work with the other groups, parties and Syrian political figures to form a nucleus of a secular democratic front and a foundation for the democratic change. This front will have to do a lot of tasks, such as unifying the war-torn country, joining effort to boost the democratic political process, getting rid of the dictatorship after draining all sources of terrorism and achieving safety and stability in Syria.Turkey has been manipulating the opposition at the expense of the Syrian bloodshed. Therefore, we have refused to establish a link with it and preferred to follow a third line to implement our democratic project. We have chosen to be part of the Syrian society, region, and the whole world against terrorism to achieve the democratic change. We always hope to expand this front as it is the national democratic alternative in Syria.

According to the Italian constitution, once the prime minister formally submits his resignation to the president, On Monday, President Sergio Mattarella asked Matteo Renzi to temporarily freeze his resignation and stay in office for a few more days, until the budget bill is passed into law by the Senate. but it is widely expected that Mattarella will opt to form a new government, which will require parliamentary approval. Some opposition leaders, like Five Star Movement’s Luigi Di Maio, called for early elections and criticized the Democratic Party (PD) for toppling the government as a consequence of internal divisions. President Mattarella made therefore clear that an early vote would add instability to the country and does not correspond to the short term solution he is looking for. At the moment, three names have been being put forward to head Italy’s next interim government: finance minister Pier Carlo Padoan, highly respected at the European level, Senate president and longtime anti-mafia prosecutor Pietro Grasso and culture minister Dario Franceschini.Why did everybody complain about holding new elections?Italy’s current electoral law, the so-called Italicum, calls for a two-round electoral system which gives the winning party the 55% of seats in the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of the Parliament (340 out of the 618 members elected in Italy).Approved in 2015, the law is currently under review by the constitutional court as some eligibility criteria, like the party-list proportional representation and the majority bonus assigned after the ballot, are believed to be unconstitutional.President Mattarella has refused to call an early election since the Constitutional Court still has to determine the constitutionality of the Italicum, which was approved by the Parliament in 2015, opting instead for a technocratic-led caretaker cabinet until 2018 elections. Why was the referendum significant for Italy?By calling the referendum, Renzi hoped to consolidate central power and heal the internal split that affects the Democratic Party (PD) since 2007 when various centre-left parties was forced to merge into a single political entity. Instead, he has deepened the strife within members of the party, who are still unable to agree on whether he should continue leading or resign as chairman.Reducing government bureaucracy was another key aspect of the reform intended to streamline Italy’s rather complex legislative process by reducing the role of the Senate, which would have become a consultative body consisting of regional and municipal officials.Italy’s parliamentary legislature, still defined by the constitution of 1948 and based on a symmetric bicameralism system, consists of two debating chambers of 945 members elected for five years.These changes were initially meant to turn the Italian political system into a partial unicameral system except for legislations concerning European policy, constitutional and electoral laws. Many legal experts though have pointed out the necessity to preserve the existing authority as a check on the government.What’s the vote impact on the EU?Similarly to what happened in the United Kingdom with the referendum on Brexit, the outcome of Italy’s vote will contribute to the rise of a populist sentiment across Europe.The overwhelming “No” victory at the polls, suggests in fact that the Prime Minister and his party have lost voters to the anti-establishment, eurosceptic Five Star Movement and right-wing’s Northern League, both of which led a strong campaign against the proposed reforms and won 60 percent of the vote.For weeks, opposition leaders While Five Star Movement and Northern League leaders have welcomed the “No” victory as a major opposition campaign success, many Italians who voted against the government-proposed reforms would not support these parties in a national election claiming that the rise of populism may be extremely dangerous for the future of Italy and the EU.A vote on Italy’s membership in the European Union and a sudden consequent exit from the Eurozone would in fact be fatal for the country as it would undermine the currency’s stability and possibly contribute to open a further split among loyal EU members.What are the consequences for national economy?The outcome of the referendum has raised long-term concerns among investors and financial analysts about the future of Italian economy and banking sector.The stability of national banks has in fact been one of the core issues of Renzi’s attempt at constitutional reform as, for the past year and half, the government had been working to recapitalize retail banks and institutions affected by non-performing loans.Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS), one of the country’s biggest and most troubled financial institution, was the object of the government efforts of stabilizationOver the week-end, banking stocks went through a rollercoaster ride on the Milan stock exchange and opened sharply lower on Monday following the rejection of the constitutional reform and Renzi’s announcement of resignation.MPS, who lost nearly 85 percent of its market capitalization since the beginning of the year, becoming the worst performer from European Banking Authority (EBA) stress tests in July, closed the day with its capital shares down at 4.2 percent.Analysts are now worried that the current political turmoil might turn away private investors, making it difficult for the bank to raise the funds it need to fill capital gaps by selling assets.Despite that, MPS decided to stick to its plan to sell 5 billion euros worth of new capital shares after Sunday’s vote with the hope to unload 27.6 billion euros in non-performing loans to ensure its own survival.An extended period of political instability would in fact hamper the growth of Italian economy and bring back a dark period of stagnation."

Trump’s nomination of Dr. Ben Carson to lead HUD reminds me of that commercial,” Rep.

Forty-one percent of voters in the state now hold a favorable opinion of the president-elect ― the highest ever favorable rating in any Siena poll of New York. Trump’s favorable rating is 7 points higher now than it was when the college conducted its last poll just before Election Day. Likewise, his unfavorable rating has dropped by 10 percent in the same period, from 63 to 53 percent.Trump lost the largely Democratic state to rival Hillary Clinton by a margin of 37 percent to 58 percent.While New Yorkers are equally divided on whether Trump will have a positive impact over the next four years, a large majority are optimistic that Trump’s policies will be good for issues including infrastructure, terrorism and jobs.Seventy-two percent of New Yorkers believe that a Trump administration is likely to improve the quality of the nation’s infrastructure. A near unanimous number of Republicans hold this belief, and a large number of Democrats (64 percent) and independents (72 percent) agree. More than 6 in 10 New York voters say the Trump administration is likely to protect the country from terrorism. An equal proportion of voters believe Trump is likely to create more good-paying jobs.New York voters are divided, however, on how well the Trump administration will handle Supreme Court appointments and health care. And a majority of New Yorkers don’t think Trump is likely to establish “a spirit of bipartisanship in Washington.” Trump’s national favorable rating has also increased by 7 points since early November, according to the HuffPost Pollster national chart that aggregates publicly available polls. About 47 percent of Americans currently hold a favorable opinion of Trump, while about 50 percent hold an unfavorable one.

The three-alarm fire broke out late Friday night during a dance party at the Ghost Ship artists’ collective warehouse. Eyewitnesses described flames pouring out of the multi-level building. The roof ultimately collapsed onto the warehouse’s second floor. Officials said there were about 50 people inside. They anticipated dozens of casualties, making the blaze one of the deadliest fires in Oakland’s history. The cause of the fire is still unknown, though the city had recently received complaints about “blight and unpermitted construction” at the warehouse, according to officials.

It’s a big decision and nobody should rush through it.”That was just days after spokesman Jason Miller told reporters that Trump was down to four choices. Miller actually named former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, while numerous published reporters mentioned Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker and retired Army Gen. David Petraeus. “The secretary of state position has been narrowed down to four potential candidates,” Miller said.But now, Trump plans to meet with Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson on Tuesday and former NATO Commander James Stavridis – who actually was being considered as a running mate for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton – on Thursday. Other names reportedly under consideration: former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman and West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin.All of which raises questions about Romney, the biggest and most unlikely name to date to emerge as a candidate for Trump’s cabinet. Romney not only opposed Trump during the Republican primaries, he was also among the most outspoken Republicans to denounce Trump as wholly unqualified for the presidency.Romney nevertheless made a visit to Trump’s golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, last month, spending nearly an hour and a half meeting with Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence. Two weeks later, he journeyed to New York to dine with Trump and incoming White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. The menu included frogs’ legs soup, and photos from the meeting showed Romney’s tight smile.Ryan Williams, an aide to Romney during his unsuccessful 2012 White House run, was glad to see his former boss work for the greater good of the country, even if it meant setting aside his differences with Trump.On Monday, Williams wasn’t sure what to make of the latest turn. “I don’t think anyone really knows what’s going on,” he said.Other Romney aides have suspected all along that Trump is more interested in humiliating Romney by subjecting him to a very public courting process before ultimately choosing someone else.One prominent GOP consultant, not a former Romney aide, said that it seemed like Trump is at this point intentionally stringing things out. “If you wanted to torment Mitt Romney, what would do it more than this?” he said on condition of anonymity to criticize the incoming president from his party.The consultant added that he wouldn’t be at all surprised if, in the end, the job goes to either Romney or Huntsman – because of their looks. “That’s the only criteria we know of from Trump himself, right? That you look like a secretary of state?” he said.Grossman, the reality TV show producer, said he also wouldn’t be surprised if it’s Romney – one, because it makes Trump seem magnanimous for even considering him, and, two, it would let him send Romney all over the world on errands that Trump doesn’t want to do himself.“He’s a famously vindictive person, so he’s thinking it would be great to have this person under my thumb for a few years,” Grossman said of Trump. “He’s a simple person to understand, but we all want to see what he’s going to do next.”"

A year and a half later ― after multiple plea deals were rejected ― the case went to trial and Chodakowski was found guilty on two felony counts: rape and sex abuse. On Nov. 29, Chodakowski was sentenced to 10 years in prison with five years of probation, and will be required to register as a sex offender for the rest of his life. That same day Goodman, who’s now 29, read a powerful victim impact statement aloud in court to the judge, jury and her rapist. Published by Cosmopolitan, Goodman’s gut-wrenching letter ― reminiscent of the now-famous impact statement from the Brock Turner case ― details the suffering and PTSD she’s endured in the aftermath of her assault. Unlike so many other survivors, Goodman wrote, she received an overwhelming amount of support from her family, friends, the judge and the jury. “My fear in heading to trial is one most victims can relate to: ‘When they hear me, will they believe me?’ I never have to wonder that question again,” Goodman wrote. “I will be forever grateful to the 11 men and one woman that unequivocally found you guilty on ALL counts of rape and sex abuse: a verdict fit for the crime.”Goodman wrote that she had gone to karaoke with her roommate, Chodakowski and a few other friends the night she was raped. Later that night, Goodman, her roommate and Chodakowski were in their apartment when Goodman fell asleep on the couch and Chodakowski put his hand up her skirt and asked if she wanted to have a threesome. She told Chodakowski no and went into her room to go to sleep. She woke up later that night to Chodakowski raping her in her sleep. Chodakoswski’s attorney attempted to claim that this was a consensual threesome. The defense later victim-blamed Goodman by insinuating that the 27-year-old came onto Chodakowski because she once agreed with her roommate that he was “attractive.” Goodman described the year and a half-long ordeal as the “single most traumatizing and even at times degrading experience.”She addressed her rapist throughout the letter, with one of the most powerful statements towards the end. She read aloud to Chodakowski:Alcohol did not assault me on the couch and put its hand up my skirt, you assaulted me. It is encouraging that 12 people did not buy the disgusting insinuation made at trial that not only did you rape me because you were intoxicated but it was because I got you drunk. I will not accept that blame. Goodman wrapped up her heart-wrenching letter, addressing Chodakowski directly: “I hope this case stands as a lesson, not just for you, Syzmon, but for all the men out there that think women’s bodies are theirs to use, and abuse. Hear me loud and clear: the women of the world will hold you accountable.”Head over to Cosmo to read the rest of Goodman’s powerful letter. Need help?

Why is it so important for you?It was extremely important for me to be myself [when I first entered the league]. Like Mike said, it’s not an original league. They hate when there’s some guy who stands out... So how I battled that is, I’m just versatile. It doesn’t matter if I have to wear glasses or listen to country music or listen to rap music or go here or go there. Whatever it is, I’m putting 100 percent Von Miller into that, and that’s how I separate myself. [Football] is just a game.With the election and the current state of America, do politics play a prominent role in the locker room?Guys always talk politics. Guys always talk about a wide array of stuff. In every locker room, you feel like there’s guys who feel like they’re the experts when they’re really not. The locker room is a different reality, it’s a different place. Being right in the locker room doesn’t mean you’re right in real life or in the real world. It’s just an interesting, neat environment that we have in the National Football League. What is the best piece of advice you’ve received during the past year?Somebody told me: “You can’t live double lives, especially when you’re a star...

Especially in the National Football League, it’s really hard to separate yourself from the next guy, and the way to do that is to be yourself, be 100 percent yourself. There’s only one Von. So if I’m me, I’m separating myself from the next guy, and that includes being studious with the facts.Seahawks star defensive end Michael Bennett, a friend of yours, has told me how challenging it is to be an individual ― to be original ― in the NFL. Why is it so important for you?It was extremely important for me to be myself [when I first entered the league]. Like Mike said, it’s not an original league. They hate when there’s some guy who stands out... So how I battled that is, I’m just versatile. It doesn’t matter if I have to wear glasses or listen to country music or listen to rap music or go here or go there. Whatever it is, I’m putting 100 percent Von Miller into that, and that’s how I separate myself. [Football] is just a game.With the election and the current state of America, do politics play a prominent role in the locker room?Guys always talk politics. Guys always talk about a wide array of stuff. In every locker room, you feel like there’s guys who feel like they’re the experts when they’re really not. The locker room is a different reality, it’s a different place. Being right in the locker room doesn’t mean you’re right in real life or in the real world. It’s just an interesting, neat environment that we have in the National Football League. What is the best piece of advice you’ve received during the past year?Somebody told me: “You can’t live double lives, especially when you’re a star... Just don’t live double lives, so you are who you are on the football field and you’re exactly the same way off the football field.”Check out my recent appearance on NFL Network’s “Good Morning Football,” where I chat about Miller, Matthew Stafford, the Atlanta Falcons and the Legion of Bark."

Holder hinted at a likely future partner in these activities.“It’s also a cause that President Obama hopes to embrace when he leaves office,” Holder said.The announcement was made at the annual State Innovation Exchange conference in Washington, D.C. The conference brings together Democratic state legislators and other party interest groups for panels and discussions about policy and the direction of the party.The news met with applause from the Democratic state legislators and local elected officials in attendance. Before the 2010 elections, there were only 14 states where Republicans controlled both legislative chambers. After a well-organized and well-funded push to win those chambers back, Republicans ended up with full legislative control in 25 states ― just in time for the last redistricting process, which began in 2011.After the 2016 elections, Republicans now control both chambers in 32 states. It is the largest state legislative majority held by the Republican Party since the 1920s.As state legislators will begin drawing new maps come 2021, Holder says that Democratic redistricting efforts cannot simply be “about drawing the lines, but winning back the offices.”Following their defeat in November, the next phase for the Democrats, he emphasized, must start from the bottom up. He called the Democratic Party’s earlier focus on the federal level “a mistake.”“We need a comprehensive approach that looks up and down the ballot,” Holder said. “Our school boards, our city and council members, our justices of the peace. Our state and local leaders are our leaders whom we interact with. Let’s move the conversation to the states and the localities.”"
76,POLITICS,GOP Leader Makes Dubious Claim That More People Will Have Health Insurance Without Obamacare,Jeffrey Young and Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kevin-mccarthy-obamacare-repeal_us_5845abc0e4b028b32338815e,And coverage will be better. And people with pre-existing conditions will still get coverage. And everyone will get a free pony!,2016-12-05,"“Wait to see what we draft,"" House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told reporters on Monday when asked how Republicans would stop healthy people from opting out of health insurance coverage.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5845bf41120000dc00eed99b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) suggested on Monday that more people would have health insurance once Republicans repeal Obamacare ― and that Congress would be able to retain popular provisions requiring companies to insure people with pre-existing conditions.Asked how Republicans could be confident premiums wouldn’t skyrocket if they repealed the 2010 Affordable Care Act, McCarthy told reporters it came down to a “philosophical difference of belief.”“We believe with more people into the market, you get greater choice and that the demand is higher,” he said. “You allow those that can’t afford it to enter the same market where they have more options, that the price will go down.”Of course, there’s a similar concept animating Obamacare. The general idea is that by requiring people to get health insurance, more people ― including healthy people ― will sign up for benefits, thus lowering the overall cost for everyone.It’s impossible to precisely gauge what effect a GOP health care reform package might have on the cost of health insurance or the number of people covered, because there currently is no plan beyond a broad, vague outline House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) unveiled earlier this year. President-elect Donald Trump’s positions on the issue have veered from vowing universal coverage to aligning himself with the more limited vision espoused by mainstream Republicans.The national uninsured rate is currently at an all-time low, below 10 percent, directly as a result of the Affordable Care Act’s coverage expansion. The law achieved this by providing financial assistance to low- and moderate-income households, by guaranteeing that health insurers had to cover any willing customer regardless of pre-existing conditions and by instituting a mandate that most people obtain adequate health coverage or pay a tax penalty if they don’t. Republicans plan to repeal Obamacare next year and delay enacting any “replacement” proposal for up to three years in a dangerous gambit that could unravel the insurance market in the meantime.Whatever final form a Republican health care proposal may take, the budgets approved by the GOP Congress in recent years and proposals ― including Ryan’s and legislation authored by Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), who is Trump’s pick to be secretary of Health and Human Services ― offer a rough roadmap that illustrates their overarching principles.The Obamacare “replacement” will almost certainly spend less money helping poorer people obtain coverage, weaken the promise of coverage for people with pre-existing conditions because it would lock out individuals who become uninsured at any point, and employ a less stringent approach than the individual mandate to induce healthier people into the insurance pool so their premiums offset the expenses of those with costly medical problems.It would be unprecedented in health policy and in health care markets to somehow cover more people than the current system without providing financial assistance that’s at least as generous, an ironclad guarantee of coverage for people regardless of their medical histories and a strong mechanism to encourage healthier consumers’ enrollment.Claims like McCarthy’s seemed based on the notion that by deregulating health insurance markets, healthy consumers would have access to skimpier coverage that would be cheaper than the plans on the Obamacare health insurance exchanges. And while this segment of the market ― which Obamacare has struggled to reach ― may benefit from lower premiums, people in it would face higher potential out-of-pocket costs for services that aren’t covered by the less-regulated plans.Meanwhile, those who are older or sicker would face higher premiums and could be denied access to coverage if insurers were permitted to raise their rates based on age and pre-existing conditions ― something GOP proposals typically advocate.Much of this is speculation because Republicans haven’t been clear about the details of their alternative, but it’s clear they plan to do something.“We’ve taken the approach of Obamacare,” McCarthy said, adding that Democrats said premiums would go down and “found that that’s not true.” The sticker prices for health insurance for healthier and wealthier people who don’t get benefits from an employer are generally higher than they were before the Affordable Care Act became law for several key reasons. The law requires insurers to cover benefits like prescription drugs and maternity care that frequently weren’t covered before. Banning discrimination against people with pre-existing conditions also opened up the insurance market to those with the greatest medical needs and highest costs. But the Affordable Care Act’s subsidies for monthly premiums and out-of-pocket costs can significantly reduce what low- and middle-income Obamacare enrollees pay. And Republican proposals typically offer much less generous financial assistance for health insurance costs, if they offer any at all.As for when Republicans’ changes would take effect, McCarthy said there would probably be a delay to implement the repeal of Obamacare, creating a crisis Republicans think Democrats will help them solve. But it’s just as likely Democrats won’t do that and will instead insist that Republicans bring the law back, as recent comments from some Democratic lawmakers illustrate.That sort of impasse could create an greater crisis in which insurance companies offer more expensive plans and healthy people therefore forego coverage. It could even convince insurers to exit the health insurance exchanges entirely to avoid the risk of participating in a struggling marketplace on track to being eliminated.One reporter asked McCarthy how Republicans could avoid raising prices while keeping popular provisions that Trump says he wants to preserve ― like ensuring health insurance access for people with pre-existing conditions and allowing young adults to stay on their parents’ insurance until they’re 26. While McCarthy didn’t vow that Republicans would actually keep those provisions intact, he seemed to think removing the individual mandate wouldn’t devastate the law.Asked how, without the mandate, Republicans would prevent people from only getting health insurance once they got sick, McCarthy said, “Wait to see what we draft.”In other words, he thinks Republicans need to repeal the law before anyone can find out what they’ll replace it with."

In a tweet Monday, he accused reporters of failing to cover him “accurately” or “honorably.”More than four in 10 Americans, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov survey, agree with Trump that he’s faced unduly negative coverage. A similar percentage, though, say Trump’s behavior toward the media has been unacceptable as well. A 41 percent plurality of Americans think media coverage of Trump has been generally too negative, with 17 percent saying it’s been too positive and 23 percent that it’s been about right. But many are also uncomfortable with the way Trump has interacted with the press. Forty-three percent say the way Trump treats journalists is unacceptable, while just 33 percent think he treats them in an acceptable way.Eighty-three percent of Americans who think Trump is covered too positively and 54 percent of those who think he’s covered about right also think that Trump’s treatment of the media is unacceptable. Sixty-one percent of those who think the press is too negative about Trump, by contrast, also find his behavior toward journalists acceptable. Unsurprisingly, opinions are deeply divided along political lines. Eighty-seven percent of Trump voters, but just 16 percent of Clinton voters, think that media coverage of Trump has been too negative. Eighty-one percent of Americans who voted for Trump believe his treatment of the press is acceptable, while just 9 percent of those who voted for Clinton say the same.As Trump prepares to take office, many media outlets have grappled with the challenge of covering a president-elect willing to traffic in blatantly untruthful statements.“When president-elect Trump lies so casually, so cynically, the news isn’t so much the false thing he said. It’s that he felt like he could just go ahead and say it, go ahead and lie to you. That’s the story,” CNN’s Brian Stelter said Sunday, noting Trump’s false claim that he had won in a landslide.As another survey question suggests, that difficulty is compounded by the fact that many of Trump’s supporters, deeply suspicious of the press, are likely to take his word over that of a media fact-checker.A 56 percent majority of Trump voters say that if a national media outlet reported that Trump said something untrue, they would be more inclined to believe him than the news outlet. Just 2 percent say they’d believe the media, with another 38 percent saying it depends on what the story is.In contrast, just 2 percent of Americans who voted for Clinton say they’d be inclined to believe Trump’s side of the argument, while 52 percent said they’d be more likely to believe the media, and 37 percent that it depends.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Nov. 24-Nov. 28 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov’s nationally representative opinion polling.

I don’t think so!” Trump said on Twitter.China, Taiwan, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei claim parts or all of the energy-rich South China Sea, through which trillions of dollars in trade passes annually.The diplomatic contretemps was one of several recently for the Republican president-elect, a real estate magnate who has never held public office and has no foreign affairs or military experience. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, is still considering whom to name as his secretary of state.The call with Taipei was the first by a U.S. president-elect or president with a Taiwanese leader since President Jimmy Carter switched diplomatic recognition to China from Taiwan in 1979, acknowledging Taiwan as part of “one China.” China regards Taiwan as a renegade province.China blamed Taiwan for the call, but also lodged a diplomatic protest with the United States on Saturday, saying the “one China” policy was the bedrock of relations between China and the United States.Pence called the uproar over the call with “democratically elected” Tsai a “tempest in a teapot.” He blamed the media for the controversy, saying the call was similar in nature to one between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping after the Nov. 8 election.“I think I would just say to our counterparts in China that this was a moment of courtesy. The president-elect talked to President Xi two weeks ago in the same manner. It was not a discussion about policy,” Pence said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”China’s Foreign Ministry said on Saturday it had lodged “stern representations” with what it called the “relevant U.S. side,” urging caution on the issue.Pence said he was not aware of any contact between the Trump transition team and the Chinese government since Friday and did not expect Trump’s team to reach out this week to ease tensions with Beijing.UNCONVENTIONAL DIPLOMACYTrump and Pence have had more than 50 phone calls with foreign leaders so far. Pence said he spoke with Jordan’s King Abdullah on Saturday.U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Sunday the Trump transition team had yet to contact the State Department for information and recommendations ahead of calls with foreign leaders.“I do think there’s a value, obviously on having at least the recommendations, whether you choose to follow them or not is a different issue,” Kerry told a think-tank conference.Trump, known for his unconventional approach to politics, has raised eyebrows with his initial forays into the complex web of international diplomacy as president-elect.He has been praised by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has sparred with U.S. Democratic President Barack Obama over Russian actions in Ukraine and Syria. Putin said in an interview on Sunday that Trump was a “clever man.”Last week, Trump offered to help Pakistan solve its problems and praised Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif as a “terrific guy” during a phone conversation, the Pakistani leader’s office said.Asked on Sunday whether that meant Trump wanted to mediate the long-running border dispute between Pakistan and India, Pence acknowledged recent violence in the Kashmir region and said Trump wanted “continued U.S. engagement” with both sides.Trump also spoke last week with Philippines leader Rodrigo Duterte, who said Trump showed understanding about a deadly crackdown on drug dealers. Duterte told Obama earlier this year to “go to hell” after Obama expressed concerns about possible human rights abuses in Duterte’s war on drugs.FIELD WIDENS FOR SECRETARY OF STATEPence also said Trump may consider new candidates for secretary of state, America’s top diplomat, after having narrowed the field last week to four people: Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee; Rudy Giuliani, former mayor of New York; U.S. Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee; and retired general and former CIA Director David Petraeus.Trump met on Friday with John Bolton, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under Republican President George W. Bush.Trump will have additional interviews with new candidates for secretary of state in the coming week, Kellyanne Conway, Trump’s senior adviser who managed his campaign, told reporters at Trump Tower on Sunday.Among the new names: Jon Huntsman, a former ambassador to China and ex-Utah governor, Rex Tillerson, the chief executive of ExxonMobil, and retired Navy Admiral James Stavridis, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters.Stavridis, a former supreme allied commander of NATO and dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, will meet with Trump on Thursday, said Stavridis’ spokeswoman, Juli Hanscom.“There has been no discussion of a position in the Trump administration,” Hanscom said. Stavridis had been vetted to be the running mate of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.An Exxon spokesman declined comment. A representative for Huntsman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday.(Additional reporting by Arshad Mohammed and John Whitesides in Washington and Melissa Fares in New York; Editing by Alan Crosby and Peter Cooney)"

Now, he’s saying that what actually happened to actress Maria Schneider on set is all a “ridiculous misunderstanding.”In a statement obtained by Variety, translated from Italian, the director said, “Several years ago at the Cinemathèque Francaise someone asked me for details on the famous butter scene. I specified, but perhaps I was not clear, that I decided with Marlon Brando not to inform Maria that we would have used butter. We wanted her spontaneous reaction to that improper use [of the butter]. That is where the misunderstanding lies. Somebody thought, and thinks, that Maria had not been informed about the violence on her. That is false!”According to Bertolucci, Schneider was aware of everything else in the scene “because she had read the script, where it was all described.” The only thing she didn’t know about, he said, was the butter. “And that, as I learned many years later, offended Maria. Not the violence that she is subjected to in the scene, which was written in the screenplay,” Bertolucci said. At the time of the shoot, Schneider was just 19, while her co-star Marlon Brando was 48. Regardless of whether or not Schneider knew of the violence, it should be noted that any addition to the scene, such as the butter, which was not previously agreed upon by Schneider, can be considered assault. Bertolucci doesn’t seem to understand that. “I didn’t want Maria to act her humiliation, her rage, I wanted Maria to feel ... the rage and humiliation. Then she hated me for all [of her] life,” Bertolucci said in the 2013 Cinemathèque Francaise interview. Schneider told The Daily Mail that she did, in fact, feel “humiliated” and “a little raped” by the experience. “I was so young and relatively inexperienced and I didn’t understand all of the film’s sexual content,” she said. “I should have called my agent or had my lawyer come to the set because you can’t force someone to do something that isn’t in the script, but at the time, I didn’t know that.”Upon learning of the news, plenty of celebrities, such as Jessica Chastain and Ava DuVernay, expressed their disgust on social media. “To all the people that love this film - you’re watching a 19yr old get raped by a 48yr old man. The director planned her attack. I feel sick,” Chastain wrote, while DuVernay called Bertlucci and Brando’s actions “inexcusable.” "

His selection was divisive, garnering both strong pushback from literary purists and exultation from fans and proponents of genre expansion.In mid-November, he informed the Nobel Foundation that he would be unable to attend the ceremony and banquet due to “pre-existing commitments.” The artist remained silent regarding his award for nearly two weeks after it was announced on Oct. 13, finally accepting the prize in a call to Sara Danius, Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy. “The news about the Nobel Prize left me speechless,” he said, according to a Nobel Foundation press release.After he declined to attend the awards ceremony, the Swedish Academy released a statement noting that his absence would be “unusual, to be sure, but not exceptional,” and adding that they “look forward to Bob Dylan’s Nobel Lecture, which he must give ― it is the only requirement ― within six months counting from December 10, 2016.” It is unclear whether Dylan’s “speech of thanks” is intended to fill this requirement or whether a more full address will be delivered in person at some point over the next six months.

Walk through the cities of Spain, and you’re likely to find streets named after regime members like general José Millán Astray, attorney Adolfo Muñoz Alonso, minister José Enrique Varela, and many more (link in Spanish).But not for long.In February, the government—applying a 2007 law that promised to get rid of the marks of autocratic heritage in public spaces—announced it would retire these street names. Now, cities around the country are renaming them after women, answering the complaint that about 90% of streets in Spain’s cities are named after men—and those honoring women usually reference saints (link in Spanish).Janette Sadik-Khan, former New York City transportation commissioner, once famously said, “if you can change the street, you can change the world.” If she’s right, Spain is on its way to a metaphorical revolution. Since 2005, the city of Cordoba has enforced a mandate that half of new streets be named after women. In Barcelona, the total number of streets named after women went from 7% in 1996 to 27.7% in 2010 (link in Spanish).To further correct the imbalance, Valencia will now name 80% of its new streets after women, and Bilbao, Oviedo and Cádiz plan to follow that example.Many of the streets have or will be named after Spanish women targeted during Franco’s regime, including activists, revolutionaries, and civil rights fighters, such as Soledad Cazorla, the first public prosecutor to specialize in gender violence. Others will carry the names of women of remarkable talent, from Spain and the rest of the world, who distinguished themselves in fields such as physics, or equal rights movements. In the city of Léon, where the selection of name is made by popular vote, a recent group of possible street names included American civil rights activist Rosa Parks, Mexican painter Frida Kahlo, English novelist Jane Austen, and Spanish inventor Ángela Ruiz Robles.Other countries should take note: the lack of streets named after women is far from just a Spanish problem.

84,THE WORLDPOST,Children Blown Apart By Bombs Cope With Mental Trauma In Jordan Hospital,"Lin Taylor, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/children-bombs-mental-trauma-jordan_us_58456a91e4b0c68e0481b9b2,It's the only center in the Middle East that performs advanced reconstructive surgery on victims of war.,2016-12-05,"Young girls, severely burnt and maimed by explosions in Yemen, Syria and Iraq, play puzzles as an occupational therapist assesses their cognitive development inside a Medecins Sans Frontieres hospital in Amman, Jordan, November 20, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58456b94120000dd00eed809.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As soon as the bombs exploded outside his house in the Iraqi town of Falluja, Rachid Jassam rushed onto the street to rescue the injured.As the teenager ran out, another plane swooped overhead and dropped more bombs, the shrapnel tearing his right leg so severely local doctors wanted to amputate it.His father refused the amputation to spare his son from a life of disability, and opted for basic surgery instead.“When I got injured, I didn’t lose consciousness. I witnessed the whole thing when the people came and took me to the hospital. I remember everything,” 15-year-old Jassam said through an interpreter at a Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) hospital in Amman in Jordan.“I lost five centimetres of my bone from my right leg and I couldn’t move it anymore.”More than 20 per cent of all patients at the MSF hospital are children just like Rachid - blown apart, severely burnt and disfigured by conflicts in Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Gaza.Since it opened in 2006, the hospital has treated almost 4,400 patients free of charge, and remains the only hospital in the Middle East to perform advanced reconstructive surgery on victims of war.But as conflicts rage across Middle East, hospital staff say resources have been stretched in recent years, with most patients coming from Syria and Yemen.For Jassam, the clinic has been his lifeline. Sitting on his hospital bed in the Jordanian capital after receiving specialized surgery on his leg, he smiles broadly as he holds onto his crutches.“Thank God, it’s God that preserved my leg.”“YOU SEE WAR EVERY DAY”Not all children are so lucky.In a small pink room on the upper levels of the hospital, young girls with disfigured faces and missing limbs grow increasingly agitated as they try to solve puzzles and play board games.“Sometimes the trauma affects their memory skills or problem-solving, and it also has psychological effects like low attention span. They can get frustrated easily and they have low self-esteem,” said occupational therapist Nour Al-Khaleeb, 24, who is part of a team of mental health specialists.“You see war every day, you see their injuries, you see how it’s affecting their lives - and sometimes it has an effect on you too,” she said, talking loudly over the girls’ screams and chatter.“Maybe they will remember that someone did something good for them, and this will give them hope later on in life.”Around 60 people, mainly young men, undergo complex orthopaedic, facial and burn reconstructive surgery at the hospital each month, according to MSF. They also receive psychological care and counselling during their stay.Mohammed, 11, said his family was fleeing the city of Homs in Syria by car when an airstrike hit, injuring him and his two brothers. He watched as his mother died in the explosion.“A part of the bomb went into my leg and fractured my bone into pieces - it cut into my nerves and tendons,” he said through an interpreter, insisting he wasn’t scared when the bombs fell overhead.Hobbling down the hospital corridor on crutches after a recent operation on his leg, Mohammed said he will get on with his life when he is discharged, and return to join his family in Jordan’s Zataari refugee camp, which hosts almost 80,000 Syrian refugees.RESILIENCEClinical psychologist Elisa Birri, who heads the mental health team, said it was common for children in the hospital, especially boys, to put on a brave front.But sooner or later, psychological symptoms like bedwetting, depression, anxiety, aggression and insomnia can crop up, said Birri. At the severe end of the spectrum, patients can experience flashbacks, panic attacks and disassociation, where they lose their sense of reality.“Children show in their drawings and during free play what they have experienced, it’s like a mirror. For example, they will draw themselves playing with guns because of the war context they came from,” said Birri, adding that children will sometimes regress to an infantile state to cope with the trauma.But having worked in Libya and Syria, the Italian psychologist added that the maturity and resilience of children living in war-torn countries were beyond their years.“They go through really big events, but you see them smiling every day, playing every day. They never stop having motivation to go on.”This rings true for 15-year-old Jassam. Even after being severely injured and besieged by Islamic State militants for eight months, Jassam said he can’t wait to return to Falluja once he leaves the hospital.“I want to go back to Falluja, I miss it. I miss everyone there,” he said, smiling and nodding his head in excitement.“I have a goat and it’s the only surviving goat and she has given birth, so there are babies waiting for me.”"

Comedian Jeff Foxworthy paid it forward, literally, over the weekend when he decided to foot the bill for a woman named Robin McFadden at the grocery store. McFadden told Fox 5 she decided to go “couponing” at the store with her three sons after one of them finished a basketball game. “I was at the register and between me worrying about my items and the kids fussing, I didn’t even know that Jeff Foxworthy was standing behind me,” she said.McFadden said that she overheard a man ask the cashier how much cash she needed to cover the bill, which was a total of about $25. When she turned around, she realized it was Foxworthy. “He laughed, walked around me, put his card in the machine and said ‘watch this.’ I told him that he was going to make me cry, gave him a hug, thanked him and took the photo!”McFadden shared the photo of herself with the comedian on Facebook, writing, “The kids were restless and look who was behind me. He paid for my order when I wasn’t looking! I love Jeff Foxworthy!” "

IMAXShift, a Brooklyn-based class that opened earlier this year, offers spinning courses where riders sit in front of a IMAX screen and are immersed in views of sunsets, mountains, the solar system and other sights.IMAXShift CEO Bryan Marcovici said the images help shift cyclers’ attention away from the exercise’s intensity. “The science of distraction is really interesting,” he told The Huffington Post. “We’re taking the focal point outside of the riders’ head and giving them something in front of them to actually anchor to.”Jesse Alexander, a master spin instructor at IMAXShift, said “people work harder when they’re visually distracted and visually immersed.”“When they see something, that makes them want to pedal faster,” he continued. “When they see something, that makes them want to turn the resistance up. It becomes a far more effective workout.”For those who can’t just run off to an IMAX spin class, try exercising with a friend or thinking about a problem you hope to solve in order to occupy your mind. Research shows that distracting yourself from exercise discomfort may push you to work harder. The benefits of fitness are boundless ― from better mental health to a lower risk of heart disease.

Kimmel is set to host the 89th annual ceremony, which will air on ABC Feb. 26. The Hollywood Reporter notes Oscars producers Michael De Luca and Jennifer Todd are expected to announce the news. This will mark the first time hosting the Oscars for Kimmel, though he does have some solid award show experience under belt after hosting the 2012 and 2016 Emmys. He’s also hosted post-Oscars late-night specials. As Deadline reports, Kimmel seems like somewhat of an obvious choice given his relationship with ABC, the network that airs his late-night talk show. ABC now has more say in the Oscars after renewing a deal to broadcast the ceremony until 2028, and the outlet reports the network really wanted Kimmel for the gig. Kimmel will succeed Chris Rock, who was unable to bring ratings up as much as hoped during last year’s broadcast. According to THR, the Rock-hosted ceremony drew an audience of 34.3 million viewers, which was an 11-year low for the telecast."
