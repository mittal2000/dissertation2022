They didn’t get what they wanted.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/595c3ba81800001d00672b6e.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"An Indiana Republican Party’s Facebook post requesting “horror stories” surrounding the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has provided  some unexpected results.As of this story’s publication, the majority of the 5,500-plus comments are stories about how the ACA has changed their lives...for the better. Since the Indianapolis Star wrote about the post, it has gone viral. It has been shared more than 4,000 times.Many posters said they are able to afford health insurance for the first time in their lives - as adults after years of being uninsured.One mentioned receiving benefits, thinking they wouldn’t pay off. The next day, a loved one suffered a broken wrist.Others have started businesses now that they can afford healthcare. Many have loved ones with terminal illnesses that would have been impossible to pay for without health insurance.A favorite :Before Obamacare, no employer I worked for would carry insurance, and working two jobs I couldn’t afford insurance on the open market. After Democrats pushed ACA through, I could get affordable coverage. In Valentine’s Day 2016, my wife was rushed into the emergency room. A previously undiagnosed hernia was killing her small intestines, and her. Doctors gave her a 1% chance of recovery, but she survived against all odds. The hospital bill was over $100,000. Insurance covered all but $200. Before ACA, this would have bankrupted us. Obamacare saved our family.Several posters noted the bill isn’t perfect but laid blame at insurance companies, along with state and federal government strong-arm tactics regarding Medicaid expansion.Some have posted “horror stories.” If the ACA is repealed, they’d lose their only avenue for health care.Several people believed their increase in premiums was due to the ACA. Others are convinced that the positive comments were fake, but the sheer variety and number of the comments with very personal details show authenticity.From broken limbs and brain tumors, from shots to screenings, this one Facebook post captures the constant and massive need for quality health care that a generic statistic from the Congressional Budget Office showing “millions losing health care” can’t quite describe.It’s tough to know why a post like this would be created in the first place or at least deleted. Maybe they were overzealous after a previous post on hosting the 2018 Republican National Convention?"

We could, for instance, have made a couple of lobster rolls (modest in size) or a lobster salad, but that would have involved figuring out appropriate side dishes. No, after a moment’s reflection, I decided that spaghetti was the way forward: pasta with lobster and just a couple of other flavors is an enduring favorite.In this case, the main “other flavor” was tomatoes: The cherry tomatoes from one particular farmers’ market grower are exceptionally good at the moment – savory to the point of meatiness, juicy and thin-skinned – though soon, at the height of the season you’ll have to evaluate the options, because a perfect full-size tomato, peeled and very roughly chopped, would be an excellent choice too.The other other flavors were to be basil, a minimal hint of garlic and a good dose of Aleppo pepper, one of the fruitiest and sweetest of moderately hot chilies. (Aleppo pepper figured in the broth accompanying the original dish at the restaurant, so, beyond its inherent virtues, it maintained some continuity with the previous night’s dinner.)All these flavors needed to be carefully dosed so as not to overwhelm the delicate lobster meat, and here’s how I did it (for the usual two portions): Having cut the lobster into nibble-sized pieces and set it aside, and having brought to the boil a pot of salted water for the spaghetti, I scored half a dozen ripe cherry tomatoes with a knife, blanched them in the boiling water for 10 seconds, transferred them to a bowl of cold water and slipped off their skins. I then quartered them, lightly salted them and set them aside. Now, in a skillet large enough to eventually hold the spaghetti, I gently warmed a couple of tablespoons of good olive oil, added a whole peeled clove of garlic and a good pinch of Aleppo pepper, and over low heat let the oil pick up flavor from the chili and the garlic without scorching or even browning either.At this point I put the spaghetti in to boil and added the quartered tomatoes to the skillet, raising the heat to medium so as to warm and lightly cook the tomatoes and let their juices run without breaking them down to a pulp. I turned off the heat and waited for the pasta to be nearly done. I then lit the fire under the skillet and when the tomato mixture was hot added the lobster to warm through, followed by the spaghetti and a handful of basil (another herb, such as parsley or mint, would have been nice too). As usual, I tossed and stirred the pasta in the pan for half a minute, adding a splash of the cooking water and checking for salt.(If you are using raw shrimp/prawns, cut five or six of them into bite-sized pieces and add them to the skillet along with the tomatoes; after 90 seconds, remove the pan from the heat and bring it back to heat when you’re about to add the spaghetti.)When transferred to a warmed serving bowl, the pasta was drizzled with our best olive oil. As we ate, both of us felt that additional zip was needed, so we sprinkled our portions with more Aleppo pepper, and that did the trick.Once the pasta water has come to the boil, this whole dish doesn’t take much longer to prepare than it does for the spaghetti to cook, so next time you can’t finish your dinner look ahead to the following night – especially in summertime, when the tomatoes are at their best."

4,SCIENCE,Think Weather Forecasts Are Bad? Try Forecasting A Volcanic Eruption.,"Popular Science, ContributorPopular Science brings its readers amazing innovations and dis...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/think-weather-forecasts-are-bad-try-forecasting-a_us_595ce545e4b0326c0a8d13e3,A new technique could bring us closer to accurately predicting volcano behavior.,2017-07-05,<p>Satellite data from Okmuk volcano in Alaska shows how much the ground was deformed after an eruption.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/595ce5ba1500004800bfc1d5.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Mary Beth GriggsForecasting the weather is hard enough — just ask any meteorologist. But imagine how difficult it would be if all the data you needed to help build tomorrow’s weather map was located deep underground, utterly inaccessible, and you had to use a totally different model for each location because the rules that governed the weather in Houston, Texas were vastly different from the rules that governed the weather in Boise, Idaho.Those are just some of the challenges volcanologists face when trying to accurately predict volcanic eruptions in the same way we frequently forecast storms. But as intense as those challenges are, the widespread ubiquity of GPS technology and other remote-sensing tech has made them more surmountable today than they were decades ago.In a study published Wednesday in Frontiers in Earth Science Mary Grace Bato, a volcanology PhD student at the Institut des Sciences de la Terre (ISTerre) in France, and colleagues detailed how weather forecasting techniques can be applied to volcanic eruptions, potentially setting the stage for volcano forecasts to show up alongside weather reports in places like Alaska or Iceland.Currently, many volcanoes around the world are monitored for signs of activity (though some of these programs are set to have their funding cut). Monitoring can help cities, towns, and residents prepare for an eruption, and can save lives when monitoring stations detect that an eruption may be imminent. Evacuations by local governments ahead of the 1991 eruption of Pinatubo saved over 5,000 lives, for instance.But real-time volcano monitoring is still not nearly as robust as weather forecasting. “We can look at a volcano and monitor it,” Bato says, “But we don’t have the capability to forecast the long term or short term evolution of the volcano.”This is where GPS comes in. Satellites can now track movements in the ground, and the position of the ground over time. This is important because the vast reservoirs of magma under a volcano are nearly impossible to directly observe, and have to be monitored based on the movements they cause on the Earth’s surface.To envision a magma reservoir, Bato says you should “think of a balloon under the volcano, where the air is the magma.”As that ‘balloon’ inflates with magma rushing into the reservoir, it pushes against the overlying layers of rock and soil. “Using real GPS data, we can see the volcano is inflating,” Bato says.That’s one of the signs that an eruption might be imminent. In this new study, Bato and her colleagues showed that by combining GPS data from satellites with an existing model of how a volcano functions, and applying applying weather forecasting techniques — also called data assimilation — they could predict what situations would lead to an eruption.That’s similar to how meteorologists take real-time data and measurements from around the world and combine them with weather models to predict the track of a storm or a heat wave.While weather models are fairly robust — though there are still disagreements about which one is better — volcanology models are in much earlier stages of development, and a model that applies to a volcano in Hawaii won’t necessarily apply to a volcano in Indonesia or Russia.But Bato’s technique is flexible. “The good thing about this technique is that you can change the model that you use. You can plug it in depending on what is appropriate for the volcano you want to observe,” Bato says. All that’s required is that the model has a temporal element that takes into account how the volcano behaves over time.So far, the technique has only been applied to simulations, but Bato and colleagues are currently testing their method at Iceland’s Grimsvotn volcano, which had a noticeable eruption in 2011, and Okmok, an Alaskan volcano.Bato hopes that as volcanic eruption models become more robust, volcano forecasting might become more common, eventually helping people and communities living in the shadow of volcanoes be better prepared for the hazards they face. “It’s a long road to get there, but it’s a great beginning,” Bato says.This article originally appeared on Popular Science."

This is a response to an Education Week commentary by Chester E. Finn, Jr. published on 6/19/2017. In June, Chester E. Finn, Jr. wrote a scathing piece comparing the work of social-emotional learning (SEL) to the self-esteem movement promoted in California in the 1980s. Using the subtitle of “faux psychology,” he tried to dismiss SEL altogether. The polemic nature of his piece is probably best dealt with by ignoring it. The author seems like Sleeping Beauty waking up after 30 years, looking around, and not realizing how much the world has changed. But given a bit of time, Sleeping Beauty may be able to adjust to the new world, and the best path forward is to engage in dialogue rather than an argument.Given the history of education fads, the author is certainly right to look critically at the way SEL is sweeping the field. But let’s begin with why this might be. For decades, education’s big issue was not self-esteem; it was that education theory and practice were robbed of the perspective that the learner is primarily a human being, that the student is a whole child. The field disregarded that children make meaning both with critical cognitive focus and with emotions and passion. Thanks to a decade or so of the No Child Left Behind Act, the idea of the holistic learner was pushed out and educators were forced to focus almost entirely on students’ testable cognitive skills.Those years did, in fact, focus us on rigorous academic outcomes comparing the U.S. with international education systems. Still, while it put needed pressure on the entire education system, let’s not forget that the billions of dollars invested in the high stakes testing approach yielded limited positive results.Ultimately, No Child Left Behind was a social experiment far greater than any self-esteem education, and the results were disappointing and in some ways even harmful.Now, in an effort to mend the system, educators are trying to build up a broader version of the learner. If we understand that reality, we can work out solutions instead of tearing down the efforts to usher in a new way of engaged, personalized, and emotionally meaningful learning. We should truly view this era of experimentation and the acknowledgement of the whole child as a welcome development.Having established this issue, let’s address the specific points the author makes. First, Mr. Finn contends that SEL skills and character are not identical; on that, he is correct. Character brings in a strong moral dimension, something SEL does not typically include or want to include. However, this does not make dimensions of social-emotional development less powerful than those of character. While there is a place for character in education, the downside is that it often verges on indoctrination rather than student exploration and choice in moral development. On the other hand, SEL quite consciously stays out of the moral business by focusing on necessary competencies, such as those associated with 21st-century learning, college, and employment skills. Still, some SEL frameworks and competency lists include a few skills that have elements or morality, such as empathy, perseverance, and self-management. Thus, a productive conversation is needed rather than an a priori decision that character education is good and SEL education is not.Second, it is true that the evidence base for SEL itself is not extremely strong, however it is incorrect to say that it doesn’t exist – and it’s a growing field! Additionally, while the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL) has done great work in the field, the paradigm shift we are witnessing today is far more than CASEL-related. A significant and exciting piece of this is that a number of research and practice paradigms are coming together to develop a robust field. SEL is a culmination of much research and testing ranging from neuroscience and trauma research, to in-depth studies on adversity and resiliency, all the way to the classification of 21st-century skills. Together, these well-researched fields represent a strong foundation for SEL. For this reason, I call it social-emotional development; it involves not only school-based learning, but also well-being and growth. Understanding it’s groundwork, it is hard to imagine that SED will be a momentary fad.Taken together, the support for SEL becomes much stronger than the author leads us to believe, and perhaps Sleeping Beauty will wake up to an enormously productive world that is reshaping education. Mr. Finn, we would welcome you to join this new world."

The upbeat mood stems from a global recovery that is now one year old and represents a welcome change from previous G20 meetings, where unsteady growth and downward revisions regularly cast a shadow.But it should be cautious optimism that prevails — policy efforts are still needed to strengthen the recovery and build more inclusive economies.What’s behind this growth momentum?A recent pickup in global manufacturing and investment activity signals that the recovery we projected in April remains on track. Our new forecast will be published in late July but we expect global growth to be around 3.5 percent this year and next.However, as our most recent G20 Surveillance Note explains, the regional composition of growth has shifted.In the United States — where the expansion is in its ninth year and cyclical unemployment has all but disappeared — a soft patch in early 2017 and policy uncertainty have tempered our outlook.The euro area — led by monetary stimulus and domestic demand — has exceeded expectations, and conditions in emerging economies have been boosted by robust growth in China and stabilizing conditions in Russia and Brazil.So yes, we have momentum. But we cannot rest easy — both old and new risks threaten our goal of creating higher growth that is shared by all.Clouds on the horizonThe risks are not limited to one region or one type of economy and, in some cases, reflect the downside of forces that are driving the recovery.Financial vulnerabilities present an immediate concern. After a long period of favorable financial conditions, including low-interest rates and easier access to credit, corporate leverage in many emerging economies is too high. In Europe, bank balance sheets still need repair following the crisis. In China, a faster-than-projected expansion — if it continues to be fueled by rapid credit and increased spending — would potentially lead to unsustainable public and private debt in the future.Left alone, this constellation of concerns could be a recipe for sudden financial distress, when the world’s economies also continue to struggle with several longer-term problems.Think of excessively high economic inequality, low productivity growth, population aging, and gender gaps. As our research shows, these challenges put a ceiling on potential growth, making it harder to raise incomes and living standards.How should the G20 respond?A call to action The best place to start is by sustaining the current economic momentum. Monetary and fiscal policies can be used to support demand where needed and feasible.In Japan, for example, while output remains below potential, fiscal and monetary support, combined with favorable global economic conditions, has contributed to particularly strong growth in recent quarters.Yet these measures will only go so far. Countries need to look for ways to guard against risk, accelerate growth, and leverage the power of international cooperation. No country is an island, and policies taken by any nation can resonate stronger and last longer with coordination from the other G20 members. Our priorities should include:Reinvigorating productivity growth. In many economies, increased resources for education, training, and incentives that encourage R&D would stimulate investment and unleash entrepreneurial energy. This would give a much-needed boost to how fast economies can sustainably grow.Above all, we need to focus on building inclusive economies. This calls for structural reforms to lift incomes and for more support to those who face disadvantages from technological changes and global economic integration.It also calls for new efforts to empower women and close gender gaps.In the G20 advanced economies, the difference between the number of men and women in the paid workforce is about 15 percentage points. The gap is even wider in the G20 emerging economies.If the G20 nations can meet their target of increasing female labor participation by 25 percent by the year 2025, it could create an estimated 100 million new jobs for the global economy.The substantial gains from closing the gender gap are just one example of what can be achieved if we act together.Another example, the Compact with Africa, initiated under Germany’s leadership of the G20 and designed primarily to boost private investment, can serve as a blueprint for stronger growth and economic diversification across the continent.I would also emphasize the coordination required to tackle global humanitarian crises — whether it is epidemics, natural disasters, or famines. The G20 has taken a significant step by committing over $1 billion in aid to the millions facing famine in Somalia, South Sudan, Yemen and North-East Nigeria. In the months ahead, we must do more to address the underlying causes behind these devastating events.Taken together, these challenges underscore the bottom line: the global recovery remains on track, but it will take tangible policy actions and stronger international cooperation to sustain and broaden the momentum.Like the band from Liverpool that went on to change the world, I hope that the G20 finds its groove in Hamburg. It should use this moment to come together — not only to achieve higher growth but also to ensure that the benefits of growth can be shared by all.From IMFBlog"

The campaign features compelling stories from people across the United States who have been affected by mental illness, including Miriam’s story below.By Miriam A.Since I was a teenager, I fought depression’s strong grip—crying, struggling to face each new day. Somehow I got through high school and college, but as my friends, one by one, got engaged or married, loneliness and hopelessness consumed my thoughts. By the time I was 30, I admitted myself to one hospital, then a second in New York.I told only a few people that I was in the hospital, including a close childhood friend. She called me while I was there and said “I only want to talk to you when you’re happy. Let’s speak then.” I never heard from her again.That rejection at a time when I felt particularly down came as a blow and set me back in my treatment. I eventually decided on making a fresh start in Los Angeles, but after a short time, I realized my illness required a support system, and I moved back to my family in Chicago, making a commitment to myself to get better.I didn’t get it before—you need to have the right therapist and take your medication each day at the same time. Your health has to be your number one priority. I got a job at a big law firm. I got married to a man who is extremely supportive and accepting of my illness. Yet I had never told any of my colleagues about my hospitalizations. Then I won a charity auction item—lunch with award-winning actress and mental health advocate Glenn Close. I shared my story with Glenn.Other than relatives, she was the first person I told my story to. I figured, if I can tell her, then maybe I can tell others and have an impact on my community.Inspired by Glenn, I founded No Shame on U, a non-profit organization dedicated to eliminating stigma and raising mental health awareness. The group does events and has an active online community, with 35,000 Facebook followers.My hope is for people to see that having a mental health condition is a medical illness, just like a physical condition. If you break your leg, you do not hesitate to seek treatment. The same is true with mental illness. Why do we treat the two so differently? Miriam is a 45-year-old mental health advocate from Illinois. To read more about Deconstructing Stigma and to meet more people like her, visit DeconstructingStigma.org."

Trump has backed the fight to save the critically ill British baby Charlie Gard...”Replying to another Twitter user, Lohan wrote that Trump, his daughter Ivanka, son Donald Jr. and wife Melania “are kind people.” “As an American, why speak poorly of anyone?” she added. Lohan has come to the defense of POTUS before. During a Facebook live-stream with The Daily Mail back in February, the “Mean Girls” star said, “I think always in the public eye you’re gonna be scrutinized, and he is the president.

Welsh and Scottish administrations announced the policy change on Tuesday, joining England, who made the same announcement last Thursday. Prior to these changes in policy, Northern Irish women could not use the NHS for no-cost abortion access, even though Northern Ireland is part of the U.K. and its citizens pay U.K. taxes. Under NHS guidelines, abortion procedures are available up to 24 weeks of pregnancy, and depending on the circumstances, beyond the first 24 weeks.The procedure is usually free under the NHS for British women, but for Northern Irish women who go to England, Scotland, or Wales to access abortion, it usually costs around 900 pounds (close to $1,100). Because Northern Ireland’s restrictions on abortion are so severe, many women travel to Britain to access them, adding the cost of transportation and accommodation onto the 900-pound cost of the actual procedure. According to the BBC, more than 3,500 Northern Irish women travel across the Irish Sea to get abortions every year. "

The New York Times has reported Trump has said he’s prepared to act unilaterally on the issue.Trump resumed tweeting Wednesday morning, before leaving for the G-20 summit in Europe, taking aim at China’s economic relationship with North Korea.The United States and South Korea on Tuesday had fired back at North Korea’s military provocations, as U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called the situation a “new escalation of the threat” from the reclusive nation.The Pentagon warned the country and its leader that the U.S. was “prepared to defend ourselves and our allies and to use the full range of capabilities at our disposal against the growing threat from North Korea.”“The United States seeks only the peaceful denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” chief Pentagon spokesperson Dana White said in a statement. “Our commitment to the defense of our allies, the Republic of Korea and Japan, in the face of these threats, remains ironclad.” Tillerson added: “As we, along with others, have made clear, we will never accept a nuclear-armed North Korea.”Gen. Vincent Brooks, the top American general in South Korea, warned Wednesday that self-restraint was the only thing preventing war in the region.“Self-restraint, which is a choice, is all that separates armistice and war,” he told The New York Times. “As this alliance missile live-fire shows, we are able to change our choice when so ordered by our alliance national leaders.“It would be a grave mistake for anyone to believe anything to the contrary.”The U.S. has also requested an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, which is expected to take place on Wednesday.The North’s missile launch, its 11th this year, is the latest in a string of tests as it continues its aim to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the United States. Monday’s launch represents a significant milestone in that venture, and experts say the rocket’s trajectory and 37 minute flight time could allow such a weapon to hit the state of Alaska.North Korean state media claimed the new missile was capable of carrying a large nuclear weapon, but The New York Times notes experts still doubt the country can make warheads small enough to fit onto an ICBM.The North often conducts major military exercises around important international and American events, and has in the past fired weapons around the American July Fourth holiday. But the move is sure to increase pressure on Trump’s administration and any plans to rein in the hermit nation.Kim used the launch to taunt the United States during its Independence Day holiday, calling the missile a “gift” to Americans.“We should send them gifts once in a while to help break their boredom,” he said, according to the country’s state-run news agency.The president spoke by phone with Xi and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe over the weekend to discuss North Korea, and the White House said “both leaders reaffirmed their commitment to a denuclearized Korean Peninsula.” This article has been updated with comment from Gen. Vincent Brooks and Trump’s tweets Wednesday morning."

He said he’d researched and attempted to obtain weapons including a suicide vest and a machine gun, reported The Press Association after his sentencing Monday. Potential targets in the United Kingdom’s capital he’d identified included Queen Elizabeth II’s London residence, Buckingham Palace, the busy shopping district of Oxford Street and an Elton John concert in Hyde Park that was held on September 11 last year — the 15th anniversary of the U.S. terror attacks.The teen intended to carry out “an act of mass murder in this country,” said Judge Michael Topolski as he sentenced Syed at London’s Central Criminal Court to a minimum of 16 and a half years in prison on Monday.Authorities arrested Syed last year after he engaged online with British security service officers posing as a militant named Abu Yusuf. In conversations with the undercover officers, the teenager reportedly revealed his intention to “do martyrdom” after causing “damage” with weapons. His defense lawyers said Syed had been vulnerable to radicalization after the arrest of his older brother, 23-year-old Nadir Syed, in 2015. Nadir Syed had planned to carry out an Islamic State-inspired beheading on Remembrance Sunday, a day in November when fallen troops and military servicemen and women are recognized in the U.K. He was sentenced to a minimum prison term of 15 years last June.

Kennedy and Abraham Lincoln.“Celebrate America and its freedoms this #IndependenceDay,” the network wrote in its first tweet.Of all the quotes CNN shared, more than half concerned the First Amendment, which includes the guarantee of freedom of the press.Considering President Donald Trump’s crusade to discredit various media outlets he deems as offering “fake news,” CNN’s decision to single out iconic figures’ thoughts on the freedom of press would seem to be no coincidence.This weekend, Trump specifically targeted CNN during yet another Twitter tirade. On Saturday, he pinned a tweet to his timeline which suggested that CNN should be renamed “fraud news,” then called his use of social media “MODERN DAY PRESIDENTIAL.” Later that evening, Trump railed against the media in a speech he gave in Washington to honor military veterans during a religiously themed Fourth of July event.On Sunday, Trump doubled down on his attacks and appeared to endorse violence against journalists by tweeting an edited video that showed him violently beating the CNN logo during a WWE match.CNN responded to Trump’s weekend Twitter rants by noting White House deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ quote from last Thursday: “The president in no way form or fashion has ever promoted or encouraged violence. If anything, quite the contrary.”Trump’s crusade against the media notwithstanding, CNN sent the country a reminder that U.S. leaders before him honored the First Amendment and touted the press’ right to hold the government accountable.View CNN’s historical words of wisdom below."

In fact, the state of Minnesota is currently experiencing the state’s worst measles outbreak in decades. There have been over 70 cases of measles in Minnesota and to put that in perspective this number exceeded the total number of cases reported in the entire United States last year. With measles outbreaks rapidly spreading across Europe and in the United States, health experts are reminding people in developed countries that vaccines save lives. In Germany kindergartens must notify health authorities about parents who fail to prove they have been counselled on child vaccination. In England, around 24,000 children each year are at risk of measles, mumps and rubella because they have not been immunized. Meanwhile, in Italy, more than 130 families are allegedly threatening to seek asylum in Austria, days after the Italian president signed a decree requiring mandatory vaccinations for school admission. It is ironic that while richer nations are struggling with measles outbreaks, Bhutan and the Maldives have completely eliminated measles, becoming the first countries in their region to stop the highly contagious disease. Both countries launched immunization programs around 40 years ago with a strategy of mass vaccination of high-risk populations. In the first 3 months of 2007, over 2,000 measles cases were reported in the WHO European Region. Measles continues to spread within and among European countries, with the potential to cause large outbreaks wherever immunization coverage has dropped below the necessary threshold of 95%. Of all cases with known vaccination status, around 90% were unvaccinated, and the rest were vaccinated with only one or two doses. This is not surprising; it is known that 2 doses of the measles vaccine is 97% effective at preventing measles, while one dose is about 93% effective. However, you can lose your immunity over time, or the vaccine may not be strong enough the first time around. Getting a vaccine doesn’t guarantee complete immunity, which is why it is advisable to get your blood checked for antibodies against the measles vaccine to ensure that it worked. Measles is a highly transmissible disease. So transmissible in fact, that 90 to 95 percent of people must be vaccinated in order to protect the entire population, or achieve what is called community immunity (also known as herd immunity). Vaccines are one of the most successful scientific breakthroughs and cost-effective health investments in history. In fact, with the exception of safe drinking water, the vaccine is widely considered to be the greatest medical invention of modern civilization. So how did we get to this point where parents refuse to allow their children to receive vaccines? Vaccines are victims of their own success. They have been so effective in fighting childhood diseases that most parents today have never seen or heard of a case of measles, rubella, meningitis, polio or pertussis. These diseases have become so rare that many people are not even aware of them. We rarely see people infected with measles, so we think measles no longer exists.Some people these days are more afraid of vaccines than of the diseases they prevent, while others do not feel that measles and other diseases represent major risks. This is far from the truth. In Europe, between April 2016 and June 2017, 30 deaths due to measles were reported, all in Romania. All of these deaths could have been prevented with community immunity.This fear of vaccines started with a study published in a medical journal over 10 years ago. The study was “badly written and had no clear statement of its hypothesis or indeed of its conclusions,” according to Ben Goldacre, the debunker of scientific fraud. The unethical and unscientific publication was retracted and the main investigator lost his license to practice. Yet even with retractions and apologies this discredited study is still quoted by parents, who put their trust in it when deciding to delay or refuse vaccines. This fraudulent publication still lives in blogs and gets shared regularly. In today's social media driven world, Facebook, Twitter and other social media sites allow people to exchange information / misinformation on a much greater scale than ever before, while publishing platforms enable anyone to easily create a dynamic website with downright wrong information. To make things worse, President Trump believes that “doctors lied” about vaccination and has shown an interest in pursuing the Wakefield conspiracy theory. As long as there are communities that have strong negative views about vaccines, there will be outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. As long as people continue to share pseudo-science and fake news on social media, anti-vaccination supporters will gain more following. If more and more parents stop supporting vaccines and immunizations, disease like measles will continue to rise, we will see sustained chains of outbreaks, and we will all see the real impact of measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases."

This is why Colin Kaepernick’s defense of Black lives in the face of closely-held American symbols is unequivocally patriotic and the fact that he still has no job should require you to question your patriotism.Simply, Colin’s commitment to human decency is as American as the colors sewn into the fabrics of the flag itself. And any failure to honor the former corrupts the true commitment to the latter. There is a backlog of history supporting Colin’s choice to protest. Black labor constructed this country and further Black exploitation advanced it. Black lives are just as important to in the makeup of America as any other group. And Colin’s career may be over for defending it.Last month, 49er’s General Manager, John Lynch suggested that Kaepernick speaks to the media to prove his desire to play. FOX Sports analyst, Ray Lewis, intimated that he must choose football over philanthropy. At every stop, there is a different requirement to demonstrate that he is more American than he is Black, with no regard to a notion that for Blacks, true Americanism is existing as both. In his Blackness, he has existed in a country that has been characteristically American in dismissing his pleas for equal protection. Instead, he must apologize for offending the sensibilities of people who don’t give a damn about his people being underserved and executed. He must answer for his why he chose to deny his Americanness. In order to defend America, like a long list of predecessors and peers, he must humbled.Humbling Black people is decidedly American. Forcing their apology for Blackness is decidedly American. Gaslighting them into believing their innate Blackness is not respectable to gain economic, political or social mobility is decidedly American. And somehow, these American behaviors are allowed to impede the very Americanness of protest, the very Americanness of Black livelihood.Blackness cannot be separated from America, despite that being a very American expectation. Blacks are expected to check their Blackness at the door when entering a college campus, or moving into an unfamiliar neighborhood, or speaking to the police. Any refusal could trigger suspicion of being somewhere they don’t belong or worse. This racism is decidedly American.The NFL, by branding and military adjacency, traffics in patriotism. An affront to it’s red, white and blue, star-studded shield is a necessary affront to American culture. Colin’s stance is seen as not only an attack on the flag, but also an attack to an American giant. But It takes no more than an undeveloped mind to interpret this country’s racism this superficially.America firmly and loudly stands against any easily identifiable act of racism. Donald Sterling instructing his mistress not to bring Blacks to his game? Easy. Racist. Riley Cooper’s threat to “fight every nigger in here”? Easy. Racist. The NFL’s laughable attempts to comply with a Rooney Rule that was it never wanted in the first place? Not as easy to attract the righteous indignation from those who don’t suffer. Surely Black people aren’t the only ones smart enough to understand these type of issues as racism. That would go astray from every Black stereotype that America holds with an emphatic grip. The issue is that this is not seen as an American problem, it is seen as an “others” problem. To ignore Black issues is to ignore American issues and any attempt to castigate Colin for his efforts and activism is to demerit Black issues. This has become one of the few unquestionably Un-American conceits to be normalized. Since it requires more than a superficial act of racism or a trigger word, white America refuses to use it as a lens to reexamine its commitment to this country.On this day, celebrate with friends, watch the fire-lit night sky, and hold true your American values. But also know that your allyship is toothless and insulting if it is conditioned on casting Blackness aside for your American symbolism. The day one can guiltlessly assert their patriotism is the day America can begin to make racism Un-American."

Twitter’s a platform for that,” he told the British tabloid.“One comment ruins your day.

He reasoned at the time that he simply needed a break.“I’m taking a break from my phone, emails and all social media for a while,” he said then. “I’ve had such an amazing ride over the last five years, but I find myself seeing the world through a screen and not my eyes, so I’m taking this opportunity of me not having to be anywhere or do anything to travel the world and see everything I missed.” "

Initially he sat the anthem out entirely, but after a discussion with an NFL player who served in the military, he changed the gesture to a kneel.“I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,” Kaepernick said by way of explaining his decision after the first protest.The move inspired other football players and student athletes to follow Kaepernick’s model in protest over police brutality toward people of color and other injustices.Kaepernick also pledged to donate $1 million in charity to underserved communities. As of June, he had given $700,000.Kaepernick opted out of his contract with the 49ers in March, becoming a free agent. He has yet to be signed by another team."

Dr. Travis Bradberry offers 15 tips that you can use today.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5952bdd51500002600900645.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Whether you’re convincing your boss to fund your project or your preschooler to wipe his own hiney after using the bathroom, persuasion is a skill that's instrumental to your success in life.Persuasive people have an uncanny ability to get you leaning toward their way of thinking. Their secret weapon is likeability. They get you to like more than their ideas; they get you to like them.Here are the 15 tricks of the trade that exceptionally persuasive people use to their advantage.1. They Know their AudiencePersuasive people know their audience inside and out, and they use this knowledge to speak their audience’s language. Whether it’s toning down your assertiveness when talking to someone who is shy or cranking it up for the aggressive, high-energy type, everyone is different, and catching on to these subtleties goes a long way toward getting them to hear your point of view. This requires a high degree of social awareness.2. They ConnectPeople are much more likely to accept what you have to say once they have a sense of what kind of person you are. In a negotiation study, Stanford students were asked to reach agreement in class. Without instruction of any kind, 55% of the students successfully reached agreement. However, when students were instructed to introduce themselves and share their background before attempting to reach agreement, 90% of the students did so successfully.The key here is to avoid getting too caught up in the back and forth of the discussion. The person you are speaking with is a person, not an opponent or a target. No matter how compelling your argument, if you fail to connect on a personal level, he or she will doubt everything you say.3. They Aren’t PushyPersuasive people establish their ideas assertively and confidently, without being aggressive or pushy. Pushy people are a huge turn off. The in-your-face approach starts the recipient backpedaling, and before long, they’re running for the hills. Persuasive people don’t ask for much, and they don’t argue vehemently for their position because they know that subtlety is what wins people over in the long run. If you tend to come across as too aggressive, focus on being confident but calm. Don’t be impatient and overly persistent. Know that if your idea is really a good one, people will catch on if you give them time. If you don’t, they won’t catch on at all.4. They Aren’t MousyOn the other hand, presenting your ideas as questions or as though they need approval makes them seem flawed and unconvincing. If you tend to be shy, focus on presenting your ideas as statements and interesting facts for the other party to mull over. Also, remove qualifiers from your speech. When you are trying to be persuasive, there is no room for “I think” or “It is possible that.”5. They Use Positive Body LanguageBecoming cognizant of your gestures, expressions, and tone of voice (and making certain they’re positive) will engage people and open them up to your arguments. Using an enthusiastic tone, uncrossing your arms, maintaining eye contact, and leaning towards the person who’s speaking are all forms of positive body language that persuasive people use to draw others in. Positive body language will engage your audience and convince them that what you’re saying is valid. When it comes to persuasion, how you say something can be more important than what you say.6. They Are Clear and ConcisePersuasive people are able to communicate their ideas quickly and clearly. When you have a firm grasp on what you’re talking about, it’s fun and easy to explain it to those who don’t understand. A good strategy here is to know your subject so well that you could explain it to a child. If you can explain yourself effectively to someone who has no background on the subject, you can certainly make a persuasive case with someone who does.7. They Are Genuine Being genuine and honest is essential to being persuasive. No one likes a fake. People gravitate toward those who are genuine because they know they can trust them. It’s difficult to believe someone when you don’t know who they really are and how they really feel.Persuasive people know who they are. They are confident enough to be comfortable in their own skin. By concentrating on what drives you and makes you happy as an individual, you become a much more interesting and persuasive person than if you attempt to win people over by trying to be the person they want you to be.8. They Acknowledge Your Point of ViewAn extremely powerful tactic of persuasion is to concede the point. Admit that your argument is not perfect. This shows that you are open minded and willing to make adjustments, instead of stubbornly sticking to your cause. You want your audience to know that you have their best interests at heart. Try using statements such as, “I see where you are coming from,” and “That makes a lot of sense.” This shows that you are actively listening to what they are saying, and you won’t just force your ideas upon them. Persuasive people allow others to be entitled to their opinions and they treat these opinions as valid. They do this because it shows respect, which makes the other person more likely to consider their point of view.9. They Ask Good QuestionsThe biggest mistake people make when it comes to listening is failing to hear what’s being said because they are focusing on what they’re going to say next or how what the other person is saying is going to affect them. The words come through loud and clear, but the meaning is lost. A simple way to avoid this is to ask a lot of questions. People like to know you’re listening, and something as simple as a clarification question shows not only that you are listening but also that you care about what they’re saying. You’ll be surprised how much respect and appreciation you gain just by asking questions.10. They Paint a PictureResearch shows that people are far more likely to be persuaded by something that has visuals that bring it to life. Persuasive people capitalize on this by using powerful visual imagery. When actual images aren’t available or appropriate, these people tell vivid stories that breathe life into their ideas. Good stories create images in the mind of the recipients that are easy to relate to and hard to forget.11. They Leave a Strong First ImpressionResearch shows that most people decide whether or not they like you within the first seven seconds of meeting you. They then spend the rest of the conversation internally justifying their initial reaction. This may sound terrifying, but by knowing this, you can take advantage of it to make huge gains in your likeability and ability to persuade. First impressions are intimately tied to positive body language. Strong posture, a firm handshake, a smile, and opening your shoulders to the person you are talking to will help ensure that your first impression is a good one.12. They Know When to Step BackUrgency is a direct threat to persuasion, so tread lightly. When you try to force people to agree instantly, studies show that they are actually more likely to stand by their original opinion. Your impatience causes them to counter your arguments in favor of their own. If your position is strong, you shouldn’t be afraid to back off and give it time to sink in. Good ideas are often difficult to process instantly, and a bit of time can go a long way.13. They Greet People by NameYour name is an essential part of your identity, and it feels terrific when people use it. Persuasive people make certain they use others’ names every time they see them. You shouldn’t use someone’s name only when you greet him or her. Research shows that people feel validated when the person they’re speaking with refers to them by name.If you’re great with faces but have trouble with names, have some fun with it, and make remembering people’s names a brain exercise. When you meet someone, don’t be afraid to ask his or her name a second time if you forget it right after you hear it. You’ll need to keep the name handy if you’re going to remember it the next time you see the person.14. They Are PleasersPersuasive people never win the battle only to lose the war. They know how and when to stand their ground, and yet they are constantly making sacrifices that help their cause. They are always giving in, giving ground, and doing things for other people that make them happy. Persuasive people do this because they know in the long run this wins people over. They know it’s better to be successful than it is to be “right.”15. They Smile People naturally (and unconsciously) mirror the body language of the person they’re talking to. If you want people to like you and believe in you, smile at them during a conversation, and they will unconsciously return the favor and feel good as a result. Persuasive people smile a lot because they have genuine enthusiasm for their ideas. This has a contagious effect on everyone they encounter.Putting It All TogetherPersuasive people are adept at reading and responding to other people. They rely heavily on emotional intelligence (EQ) to bring people to their way of thinking. With 90% of top performers high in emotional intelligence, it’s no wonder that persuasive people rely on this skill to get ahead.

The premise of the group, based at a website of the same name, is that Democratic politicians haven’t been responsive enough to ordinary Americans. But Pincus, the chief architect, told Recode that he also has a specific policy agenda rooted in fears that the party is “already moving too far to the left” and that he’d like to make it more “pro-business.” The thought of tech billionaires pushing a would-be grassroots agenda that happens to reflect their cosseted worldview and self-interest at a time of mounting inequality and populist anger tickled liberal strategists.“The weakness of the Democratic Party is not due to an underrepresentation of venture capitalists and tech company board members,” said Alex Lawson, executive director of Social Security Works, which advocates for expansion of that federal program. “The philosophical core of the Democratic Party is, and will remain, the working people who are sick and tired of politics that answers to money instead of the people.”Pincus’ contention that the political ethos of Silicon Valley executives can help the party “be more in touch with mainstream America” is especially off-base, said Jeff Hauser, director of the Revolving Door Project at the Center for Economic and Policy Research.“The rich people’s social milieu is to think that the swing voter is kind of like them, which is to say progressive on social issues and regressive on corporate power, and that’s not actually where the bulk of median swing voters in America are,” Hauser said.Billionaires such as Pincus and Hoffman “have very, very poor instincts for politics,” he said.As an example, he noted the burst of excitement among some of the U.S. elite about the prospect of centrist billionaire and former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg running for president in 2016. Indeed, in mid-2015, Pincus pitched Hoffman on his idea of raising a billion dollars on Kickstarter to try to elect Bloomberg. (Hoffman observed that Bloomberg had already looked into a White House bid and decided against it.) Abundant polling on Americans’ political views supports Lawson and Hauser’s arguments.Americans overwhelmingly back increasing spending on social programs, according to an April poll by the Pew Research Center. The same survey showed that a majority believe that “some” corporations and wealthy people don’t pay their “fair share” in taxes ― with about three-quarters of Democrats expressing that view.In addition, Win The Future’s technocratic bent seems to ignore the unexpected success of President Donald Trump and the competitive bid for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), both of whom ran populist campaigns against the reigning financial elite and the power it exerts in politics. (That Trump has stacked his cabinet with billionaires and largely abandoned his professed pro-worker economic views does not diminish how his candidacy demonstrated the appeal of anti-establishment rhetoric with the public.)Pincus and Hoffman, both major Democratic donors, have together sunk $500,000 into Win The Future. The site provides curious internet browsers the opportunity to support various policy proposals, including a demand that the government “offer every American a free engineering degree” and tell Congress to “fire Trump or you’re fired.” WTF promises to put ideas that get the most backing on billboards in Washington. Jamison Foser, a senior adviser at the San Francisco-based NextGen Climate group, tweeted that even the suggestion of free engineering degrees ― reminiscent of Sanders’ call for universal free college tuition ― smacks of self-interest, given who is proposing it.“Limiting this to engineering makes it seem like tech billionaires don’t care about education or inequality: just want to pay engineers less,” Foser wrote.Pincus begins the venture after departing as CEO of Zynga in March of 2016. The company, which created onetime hit social network game FarmVille, had difficulty transitioning to the field of mobile apps and its lagging profits reflected that.“I am not sure the creators of the lamest and the most annoying social media experiences are the exact people who should be rewiring the philosophical core of the Democratic Party as they say they want to,” Lawson said.Pincus and Hoffman toyed with the idea of campaigning against House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, two California Democrats up for re-election in 2018 who they see as out-of-touch, but decided against it for the launch, according to Recode.“We’d like to see either political outsiders or politicians who are ready to put the people ahead of their career,” Pincus told the outlet. Wealthy centrists have already invested vast sums of money in technocratic schemes to reform government, with mixed success.Hauser compared Win The Future to No Labels, a Washington-based group that pushes bipartisan process changes such as filibuster reform and has largely fizzled in its efforts.“I literally do not understand the point of this. It’s basically No Labels 2.0,” Hauser said.What’s more, Hauser noted, the site’s creators failed to buy domains with similar names like winningthefuture.com, a basic feature of successful political-website building that prevents devastating trolling. That doesn’t mean there’s no place for Hoffman and Pincus to try their hand at politics, Hauser suggested ― they are just trying it in the wrong party.“It would be much more valuable for the world if sane, but conservative, self-protective rich people who are against bigotry and recognize that climate science is real became forces within the Republican Party and supported sane Republicans in primaries rather than water down the message of the Democratic Party and its commitment to economic equality and social justice,” he said."

31,QUEER VOICES,Catholic Malta On The Cusp Of Legalizing Same-Sex Marriage,Dominique Mosbergen,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/malta-same-sex-marriage_us_595b28b3e4b05c37bb7fdff8,"The Mediterranean island nation only legalized divorce six years ago, and abortion remains illegal.",2017-07-04,"A gay pride parade in Valletta, the capital of Malta, in 2013.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/595b2e0e1500006303bfbf8f.jpeg?cache=7iB0mXjAPU&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The predominantly Catholic island nation of Malta, which only legalized divorce six years ago and where abortion remains outlawed, is on the cusp of sanctioning same-sex marriage. At the urging of Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, who won his second-straight term in a snap election last month, the Marriage Equality Bill is the first law being debated by the country’s new parliament, which convened for its first sitting on Monday. Muscat, leader of the center-left Labour Party, has vowed to expedite the legalization process, calling marriage equality a top priority for his government.“The first law that we are going to put on the agenda — and I hope that it is approved as quickly as possible — is that of the Marriage Equality Bill,” said Muscat after his swearing-in ceremony on June 5, according to a translation by the website LifeSiteNews. “We will make sure that it will be the first law to be placed on the agenda of the parliament, and that it is concluded.”Though labeled an equality “bill,” Malta’s parliament is not mulling a single law but a host of changes to existing legislation including the Marriage Act, the Criminal Code and the Civil Code. As the Times of Malta explained, the aim of the bill is to “’modernize the institution of marriage’ so that all consenting adult couples would have the right to enter into marriage.” This will include replacing references of “husband,” “wife,” “mother” and “father” in existing laws with gender-neutral terms like “spouse” and “parent.”  “Malta wants to keep leading on LGBT issues and civil liberties, to serve as a model for the rest of the world,” Muscat told the BBC this week. The bill is expected to be unanimously approved, reported Malta Today. Simon Busuttil, the center-right Nationalist Party leader who lost to Muscat by a landslide in the recent election, said last week that his party would support the new legislation.When it comes to social and sexual rights, Malta is a paradox. A country that’s 98 percent Catholic, it only legalized divorce in 2011 ― and even then, to the chagrin of many government and religious leaders. The island nation that’s situated between Sicily and the North African coast remains the only country in the European Union where abortion is banned under all circumstances.Yet, when it comes to LGBTQ rights, Malta has emerged as a European leader. In 2014, the Maltese government passed a law recognizing same-sex civil unions, including the right of gay couples to adopt. Last year, Malta became the first European country to make gay conversion therapy illegal, deeming it to be a “deceptive and harmful” act.“Life has changed a lot for gay people in Malta over the past two years,” Russell Sammut, a Maltese gay rights advocate, told Time magazine in December. “Up until 2014 we had no rights here, but once civil unions were enacted people changed their attitudes overnight. Everyone is afraid of the unknown, but now they’ve seen there’s no threat to society, they’re fine with same-sex partnerships.” A poll conducted last year by the Malta Independent found most Maltese people in support of marriage equality. The paper said 61 percent of poll respondents were in favor of gay marriage. "

This year, nearly 15,000 people were being sworn in as U.S. citizens at more than 65 such gatherings across the country, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.They took the oath of citizenship in public libraries, national parks and museums. Some of the ceremonies were on aircraft carriers or baseball fields. One was at Monticello, the Virginia home of founding father Thomas Jefferson. At one of those ceremonies, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) ― the daughter of immigrants from India and Jamaica ― took not-so-veiled jabs at President Donald Trump, who has called for limits on legal immigration along with his effort to ramp up deportation of undocumented immigrants. “Whenever you feel that future is threatened, whenever those values of liberty and justice for all that drew us here seem under assault, you need to speak up and speak out,” Harris said at a ceremony on the battleship Iowa in the Port of Los Angeles on Monday, according to prepared remarks. “That’s the whole point of the freedoms we cherish.”In order to become a citizen, immigrants must be a permanent resident, or green card-holder, for at least five years in most cases or three years if naturalizing through marriage; read, write and speak English; and pass a citizenship test. That test isn’t easy ― check out some of the questions ― but more than 97 percent of would-be citizens pass, compared to only about two-thirds of voting age Americans, according to a 2012 study.

Gard has a rare genetic condition that has left him unable to breathe or move his arms or legs on his own, according to a United Kingdom Supreme Court decision in June. White House spokeswoman Helen Aguirre Ferré said Trump offered to help after hearing about the situation. “Although the President himself has not spoken to the family, he does not want to pressure them in any way, members of the administration have spoken to the family in calls facilitated by the British government,” she said in a statement Monday afternoon. “The President is just trying to be helpful if at all possible.”Last Tuesday, the European Court of Human Rights upheld previous court rulings to allow the hospital to discontinue life support, citing United Kingdom domestic courts’ conclusion that “it was likely that Charlie would suffer significant harm if his present suffering was prolonged without any realistic prospect of improvement, and the experimental therapy would be of no effective benefit.”Gard’s parents, Chris Gard and Connie Yates, posted on Facebook afterward that they were “utterly heartbroken” and that they and Charlie had “been massively let down throughout this whole process.”Pope Francis weighed in on the case on Sunday, siding with Gard’s parents. The Vatican issued a statement that the pope “prays that their wish to accompany and treat their child until the end isn’t neglected.”Gard’s parents are still fighting to take their son home from the hospital to die. They said last week that doctors had planned to take Gard off life support on Friday but it had been postponed.“Together with Charlie’s parents we are putting plans in place for his care, and to give them more time together as a family,” a spokesman for Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust told The Washington Post. “We would ask you to give the family and our staff some space and privacy at this distressing time.”This article has been updated with a statement from a White House spokeswoman."

They",2017-07-03,<p>President Trump’s energy policies are badly out of synch with the wishes of the American people. An overwhelming majority of U.S. adults favors expanding the development of solar and wind energy over fossil fuels. </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/595a50901800001a006728c9.png?ops=crop_28_71_717_391%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Some of the fireworks we can expect to see in Washington, D.C. soon will have nothing to do with the Fourth of July. They will be fireworks of the political kind over the future of America’s vast and vital electric system.Energy Secretary Rick Perry lit the fuses last April when he ordered a study on whether federal support for wind and solar energy is making our electric system less reliable by forcing the retirement of coal- and nuclear-fired power plants.This is not an insignificant issue. Energy is the lifeblood of our economy, the foundation of our quality of life and fundamental to national security. It matters where we get it, how reliable and secure it is, whether it enhances our energy independence and how it affects the quality of our air, land, water and climate. Now, new technologies, market forces and security concerns are challenging our dependence on fossil fuels and forcing a confrontation with some of the richest companies in history at a time when money is allowed an undue influence on public policy.It is premature to judge a study before it is published, but Perry’s public statements have triggered concerns that this one is being done without sufficient transparency and public input, and that its real purpose is to support President Trump’s ill-advised plans to establish world dominance in the production and export of fossil fuels.Trump has not shown much love for renewable energy options like wind and solar power, although that is the direction the rest of the world is moving. During last year’s campaign, he called renewable energy a “big mistake” and “just an expensive way of making the tree-huggers feel good about themselves.” It doesn’t seem to bother him that an overwhelming majority of citizens don’t agree. A new survey by Pew Research Center found that 83 percent of Americans agree that “increasing use of renewable energy resources is a top or important priority for the country’s energy policies.”Unfortunately, it is common practice for a president’s team to affirm his preconceptions and misconceptions rather than speaking truth to power. Trump’s team appears to be creating a sycophantic echo chamber on energy policies. The science that contradicts the President’s dismissal of climate change and underscores the need for a transition to clean and sustainable energy is being dissed and defunded. Climate cynics occupy key posts in the Administration while federal climate scientists are getting pink slips.So, it’s no surprise that clean energy advocates suspect that Perry’s study is designed to add to the echo chamber. A simple test of the study’s credibility will be whether its conclusions have been validated in a rigorous peer review.The bigger question is why Trump is so out of touch with the American people, the international community, reputable science, and market trends. Bias and bad advice are part of the answer. Money might be a factor, too.A fresh example of bad advice is a blog written by one of Trump’s former campaign advisors and published on-line last week. Stephen Moore, now a visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation and until recently a contributor to Fox News, wrote glowingly that Trump’s energy plan — which would give oil, coal and gas producers free reign to operate without important environmental constraints — will make America the world’s new Saudi Arabia. Moore’s arguments are a litany of alternative facts and zombie logic – the old-think that keeps rising from the grave when we thought that real facts killed it long ago. Here are a few of many examples, with Moore’s arguments shown in italics:Wind and solar power will be unviable for years to come because of low natural gas prices: Actually, unsubsidized wind and solar energy are already viable in a rapidly growing number of markets around the world. The World Economic Forum reports that electricity from unsubsidized wind and solar is competitive with coal in more than 30 countries and could achieve grid parity in two-thirds of the world within the next few years. Nasdaq concurs, saying that solar technologies are generating electricity at lower cost than new coal, nuclear and combined-cycle natural gas plants. Despite low natural gas prices, wind and solar energy accounted for more than 60 percent of all new electric generation capacity in the U.S. last year, as well as 55 percent of new global power capacity, the most ever recorded according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.We are entering an age of American (fossil) energy renaissance that will last for decades: Prolonging our unsustainable dependence on fossil fuels is not a renaissance. Although natural gas could be an important transition fuel if the industry dealt with its methane emissions and fracking controversies, there are legitimate uncertainties about how long fossil fuels will dominate our energy mix. Underground reserves are no longer good indicators of how long the carbon era will last. Not all proved reserves can be economically extracted and what’s economical is changing. The falling costs of solar and wind power, the carbon pricing already used in 40 countries, declining shareholder confidence in traditional energy companies, and the world’s resolve to slow climate change are among the market forces likely to keep much of the reserves in the ground.Renewable energy is expensive, unreliable and a “bad” bet. ― If that’s true, then a lot of CEOs should be fired right now. A recent study found that 63 percent of America’s largest 100 companies have created renewable energy goals. Nearly 200 of the Fortune 500 companies saved about $4 billion last year by betting on 80,000 emission-cutting investments.Many states and cities, red and blue, have pledged to get 100 percent of their energy from renewables in the years ahead. Why? In addition to better air quality and public health, solar and wind power are creating new jobs 12 times faster than the overall economy. Governors from both political parties have advised Trump that renewables are paying off in rural areas where he did well in last year’s election. “The nation’s wind and solar resources are transforming low-income rural areas in ways not seen since the passage of the Homestead Act over 150 years ago,” red and blue-state governors recently told Trump in a recent letter.Without billions upon billions of government mandates, tax credits, production subsidies, and ‎other tax giveaways, there would be virtually no wind and solar industry today in the United States. – Like many other emerging technologies in U.S. history, renewable energy has been given a leg up by federal subsidies. The rapid progress of solar and wind technologies shows the subsidies are paying off. Besides, government assistance that helps beneficial new technologies break into the marketplace makes a lot more sense than the billions of dollars mature fossil fuel industries have been receiving for generations. By 2009, fossil fuels had received nearly $450 billion in taxpayer subsidies in the United States while renewable energy received about $6 billion, according to research by the investment firm DBL Investors. Now, federal subsidies for renewable energy are being phased out, but there is no visible momentum in the White House or Congress to phase out subsidies for oil, gas and coal.The real renaissance waiting for Trump’s leadership is the modernization of the electric grid. It is considered the greatest engineering achievement of the 20th century and the largest integrated machine on Earth. But it has aged, improved energy technologies are making it obsolete, and it’s increasingly vulnerable to power interruptions from worsening weather and cyberattack. In its 2017 report card on the nation’s infrastructure, the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) concluded that our electric system deserves no more than a D+ today, that power lines have exceeded their life expectancy, and that we need to find an additional $177 billion to upgrade the system by 2025.This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reinvent the grid so that it supports today’s clean energy technologies and the growing number of customers who like to produce their own electricity. The ASCE concurs. It says that “increased investment in alternative sources of energy for power generation, heating and cooling, transportation, and process industries is needed for a sustainable future.” These investments are lagging mostly because of the lack of a solid federal energy policy, the ASCE says.In regard to money, the financial disclosure report that candidate Trump submitted to the Federal Elections Commission (FEC) last year listed investments in a variety of fossil energy companies including ExxonMobil, Canadian Oil Sands LTD, Conoco Phillips and Halliburton. Since then, Trump has said he’s sold off stocks that might be considered conflicts of interest, but he reportedly has not offered specifics.In addition, fossil energy companies were generous contributors to the more than $100 million spent on Trump’s Inauguration. Inaugural Committee records filed with the FEC show that Chevron, Exxon, British Petroleum and Citgo Petroleum each contributed a half million dollars; coal giant Murray Energy contributed $300,000; the CEO of the company that developed the Dakota Access Pipeline gave $250,000; coal plant developer White Stallion Energy donated $175,000; and $100,000 each came from the fracking company Continental Resources and from additional oil companies including Valero Energy Corp. and Anadarko Petroleum.Politico reported in April that a dozen of the President’s advisers and White House staff also are invested in fossil energy companies including ExxonMobil and Chevron. Politico’s review of financial disclosure forms concluded that six of Trump’s senior advisors hold millions of dollars in energy company stocks.If Trump wants to be the president that leads America in an energy renaissance, there are several things he should do differently. He should build on rather than reverse his predecessors’ clean energy work, he should add renewable energy experts to his advisors, he should prove that neither he nor the members of his team have vested interests that bias their work on energy policy, he should rejoin the Paris Climate Accord, he should stop emasculating federal science and clean energy programs, he should develop a roadmap for America’s transition to a competitive clean energy economy, and he should bury the energy zombies once and for all.Donald Trump has become president at a historic inflection point in which the world needs to end energy poverty; the United States needs to modernize its power system; and everyone must act quickly to fend off irreversible climate instability. The question is whether Trump is the right president for this moment in history. So far, the answer is “no”."

The question remains, are the nine nuclear states (US, Russia, UK, France, India, Pakistan, Israel, China and North Korea) ready to give them up? Spoiler alert: Of course not.The exclusion of the nuclear armed states has actually sped up the entire process. With no hardline dissent in the room, the treaty has come to fruition rather quickly. In the United Nations, language is at the core of every negotiation. UN delegates argue for hours and weave words so definitely, sensitively and strategically to make policy – to enact change – that impacts the world. Member states have together agreed upon words to form treaties that prohibit landmines, cluster bombs, chemical and biological weapons; and other treaties that recognize states, support refugees and lift nations out of poverty. Words make a difference. Words have power. Words tried to stop the US from invading Iraq, and words proved why the US should have listened. Now words are being used to confront the last remaining weapon of mass destruction not yet banned, weapons that were made to end the world–nuclear weapons.Delegates met for one week in March, and will meet in round the clock negotiations until July 7th. Every day, countries including Egypt, Iran and Sweden, who support the treaty, discuss which words will make it in, and which ones will not. The United States and the 8 other nuclear armed states have boycotted the conference, and persuaded their allies, under the so-called nuclear umbrella, to do so as well. It’s expected that over 120 countries will sign on to it. “The majority of the worlds countries have stood up to them and said enough is enough. We will not put the planet at risk anymore, we will not put all human life at risk anymore,” said Ray Acheson a Canadian member of the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF).Acheson is one of hundreds of civil society members in attendance at the ban treaty negotiations. The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) has united almost every anti-nuclear related non-governmental organization to join the fight. They brought the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons to the forefront of the nuclear disarmament movement, and have propelled these arguments through the UN. ICAN campaigners have descended on New York to lobby member states, dissect the treaty drafts, and persuade delegates to adopt language that will effectively and permanently ban nuclear weapons.For Dr. Kathleen Sullivan, disarmament educator and anti-nuclear activist, she is more worried about accidents than intentional use, “How many of you made a mistake this week, or had your phone malfunction?” she asked at a First Committee side event in June. “Human beings who make mistakes are monitoring technology that will eventually break. Fallible people are in control of thousands of nuclear missiles on high alert that are armed and ready to go.”Dr. Sullivan’s fears are not unfounded. “The world, even after a limited use of nuclear weapons could suffer tremendously,” says Dr. Ira Helfand from the Nobel Peace Prize winning International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW). “If nuclear war is waged on populated cities, not only would the climate change as it does when a massive volcano explodes, but it would coat existing agriculture in radioactive isotopes and render it inedible. We only have enough grain stockpiled to sustain life for 3 months.”“We didn't wait for murders to stop killing people before we made murder illegal,” said Zia Mian, a nuclear weapons expert and professor at Princeton University who focuses on the Indian/Pakistani conflict. “These weapons are not just wrong. They are illegal. We are saying that these weapons have no place in our wars.” As of today, no one can be sure of the immediate effects of the treaty. It is clear that the nine nuclear weapons powers will not sign the treaty. They have boycott the negotiations. US ambassador at the UN Nikki Haley said, “As a mom, as a daughter, there is nothing that I want more for my family than a world with no nuclear weapons, but we have to be realistic. Does anyone think North Korea will give up their nuclear weapons?” But one thing is certain — the unprecedented effort of civil society has democratized disarmament, and pushed the majority of the worlds countries to observe the will of the people in an effort to save the planet from the threat of nuclear war.Ari M.

The irresistible TV Land series returned for a fourth season this summer with its millennial-skewing antics intact, but now with a growing feud between former BFFs Liza (Sutton Foster) and Kelsey (Hilary Duff). In the final moments of last season, Liza essentially pressed the self-destruct button on the friendship by revealing she’s been pretending to be 26, leaving Kelsey to process on their so-chic-it-must-be-TV couch. “It’s really shocking and hurtful for Kelsey to let all of that sink in and try to understand it,” Duff told HuffPost during a Build Series interview. “The worst part is that [Liza] didn’t even give her an opportunity to tell her [the truth].“Kelsey would have accepted all of this, I believe, but this lie has gone on for so long, and it has so cheapened all of their experiences, memories and things they’ve built together. “Kelsey mean-girls her really hard,” Duff added. The two are certainly at odds in the opening episodes, with Foster revealing that this was a “torturous” season to film because of the shifting relationships on-screen. “The dynamic on set changed,” co-star Molly Bernard said. “It was weird shooting scenes with Sutton and Hilary. ... I really loved the choice that you made that you wouldn’t look at her.”And if a devastating lie wasn’t enough to put this friendship six feet under, flirting with an ex-boyfriend might do the trick. Kelsey bonds with Liza’s former flame, Josh (Nico Tortorella), over a shared betrayal, leading to a possible romance and an even bigger scandal. “Our hearts are broken by the same woman,” Tortorella explained. “We’re the only two that know about it and are hurt about it.”“It’s only natural to find a little bit of comfort in one another,” Duff added with a smile. This all begs the question of what’s more unforgivable: Lying to your best friend about your age, or hooking up with your best friend’s ex-boyfriend?Watch the full interview with the “Younger” cast below.

Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) is unafraid to call out the inadequacies she sees in President Donald Trump and his administration ― as she demonstrated yet again in a searing address on Saturday. Speaking at this year’s Essence Festival in New Orleans, Waters explained why she believes Trump is unfit for the presidency, and made a powerful plea for him to be impeached. She also offered pointed critiques of several appointees within his administration, including Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, who she argued is vastly unqualified for his position. “Ben Carson was appointed to be the HUD secretary,” Waters told the crowd of mostly black festival-goers. “He knows nothing about the mission of HUD. He doesn’t care about people in public housing. He believes that if you are poor, it is your own fault. And he doesn’t know the difference between an immigrant and a slave.”In a March speech, Carson did, indeed, bizarrely describe slaves as ”immigrants,” saying they came to America and “worked even longer, even harder for less” than other immigrants. In a Facebook post, he later acknowledged that “the slave narrative and immigrant narrative are two entirely different experiences,” as “immigrants made the choice to come to America” while “slaves were forced here against their will and lost all their opportunities.”On Saturday, Waters explained why she believes Carson, a retired neurosurgeon and former Republican presidential candidate, does not belong in the White House. “He needs to go back to the hospital, back to the operating room,” she said. “If he thinks, when he comes before [the House Committee on Financial Services], where I am the ranking member... and thinks that I am going to give him a pass, I am going to take his ass apart.”Waters received raucous applause before going on to call out others within Trump’s administration, including Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. (Waters described Sessions as a “racist,” an accusation that the record supports.) She explained why she thinks their policies could be harmful for millions of Americans and why they are unfit to govern. “[Trump] has hired in his Cabinet the most unqualified, uncaring, inexperienced people who don’t give a damn about any of us,” she said. Waters saved her parting words for Trump and reiterated why she’s using her voice and platform to call for his impeachment. “I have taken off the gloves. I am not going to tolerate a president who showed us who he is in the campaigns,” she said. “I don’t honor him. I don’t respect him and I’m not going to tolerate him. I’m going to do everything that I can do to get him impeached.” "

The gun reportedly went off, shooting the man in the groin.Jelks, whose car had been outside his girlfriend’s home, dashed into the house and made a beeline for the bathroom, reported WKMG-TV.

Researchers at Imperial College London have announced that they were granted ethical approval to conduct a small MDMA trial on people with alcohol addiction in the city of Bristol, The Guardian reported last week. For the trial, 20 patients — all of whom are heavy drinkers whose previous treatments for alcoholism have failed — will undergo psychotherapy sessions while under the influence of 99.99 percent pure MDMA.MDMA is an empathogen, or drug known to produce feelings of love, social connection and empathy. Researchers hypothesize that this effect could help people with alcohol addiction get more out of psychotherapy sessions.“It’s using drugs to enhance the relationship between the therapist and the patient, and it allows us to dig down and get to the heart of the problems that drive long-term mental illness,” Ben Sessa, a clinical psychiatrist involved in the trial, told The Guardian. Earlier clinical studies have shown MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may be effective in treating trauma and anxiety. In a small study from 2010, more than 80 percent of patients with post-traumatic stress disorder stopped showing symptoms of the condition after two sessions of therapy following supervised MDMA use. MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may also be effective in helping people with autism who suffer from social anxiety, suggests preliminary findings from a recent study. Compared to placebo, participants who took MDMA before attending therapy saw a “marked drop in their anxiety” after two sessions, according to Discover magazine.In a 2015 interview with HuffPost, Rick Doblin, executive director of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, an organization dedicated to raising awareness and supporting research into psychedelics for medical use, explained how MDMA can help patients suffering from trauma. There’s a misconception that these drugs are dangerous because they make people lose control, he said.“But in fact, we’re seeing that keeping things in control is often what’s keeping these disorders from getting healed,” Doblin said. “When someone is able to let go of their normal sense of controlling their emotions or not feeling things or pushing things down, an astonishing type of healing can take place.”Sessa told The Guardian that MDMA’s ability to treat people with trauma could have similarly profound impacts on people with alcohol addiction.“We know that MDMA works really well in helping people who have suffered trauma and it helps to build empathy. Many of my patients who are alcoholics have suffered some sort of trauma in their past and this plays a role in their addiction,” he said.  Sessa has long been an advocate of using psychedelic drugs like MDMA, marijuana and psilocybin (aka “magic mushrooms”) to treat mental illness. According to his website, he’s currently involved in two MDMA studies: one looking at alcohol addiction, and another investigating the exact mechanism behind MDMA’s effect on the brains of patients with PTSD. Watch a TED Talk he gave last year about MDMA-assisted psychotherapy:Drug-assisted psychotherapy “is a radical new way of looking at treating mental illness,” Sessa told Psychedelic Press in an earlier interview. ”[But] because of the history of drug misuse in culture ― and the continued problems with drugs in our society today ― it is also controversial subject. But it need not be; the psychedelic drugs (unlike cocaine, alcohol and many prescribed drugs) are extremely safe ― despite their negative public perception.”Sessa said his life’s work is dedicated to challenging this bad reputation. “I feel it is a worthy cause to be backing because ultimately it is the patients that are missing out on these wonderful medicines and they deserve the chance to see them researched,” he said. Other experts in this field have warned, however, that recreational use of drugs like MDMA can have negative effects, too. “I’ve seen people in my practice who took MDMA at a party and weren’t prepared for the memories that came up, and it was really harmful for them,” psychiatrist Michael Mithoefer, one of the authors of the 2010 study on MDMA-assisted therapy, told Nature in April.People high on MDMA can also experience adverse physical side effects, such as nausea, muscle tension, sweating and chills. High doses of the drug can “lead to a spike in body temperature that can occasionally result in liver, kidney, or heart failure or even death,” according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.The Drug Enforcement Administration considers MDMA a Schedule 1 drug, defined as substances with “no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.” Heroin, LSD and marijuana are also in this category. MDMA’s status may change in the near future, however. Last year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave researchers the green light to conduct phase three clinical trials on MDMA for PTSD treatment. Phase three is the final stage before the FDA can grant approval for public use of a drug.Need help with substance abuse or mental health issues?

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5959018e1500006303bfbcec.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"MEXICO CITY, July 1 (Reuters) - A tower of human skulls unearthed beneath the heart of Mexico City has raised new questions about the culture of sacrifice in the Aztec Empire after crania of women and children surfaced among the hundreds embedded in the forbidding structure.Archaeologists have found more than 650 skulls caked in lime and thousands of fragments in the cylindrical edifice near the site of the Templo Mayor, one of the main temples in the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan, which later became Mexico City.The tower is believed to form part of the Huey Tzompantli, a massive array of skulls that struck fear into the Spanish conquistadores when they captured the city under Hernan Cortes, and mentioned the structure in contemporary accounts.Historians relate how the severed heads of captured warriors adorned tzompantli, or skull racks, found in a number of Mesoamerican cultures before the Spanish conquest.But the archaeological dig in the bowels of old Mexico City that began in 2015 suggests that picture was not complete.“We were expecting just men, obviously young men, as warriors would be, and the thing about the women and children is that you’d think they wouldn’t be going to war,” said Rodrigo Bolanos, a biological anthropologist investigating the find.“Something is happening that we have no record of, and this is really new, a first in the Huey Tzompantli,” he added.Raul Barrera, one of the archaeologists working at the site alongside the huge Metropolitan Cathedral built over the Templo Mayor, said the skulls would have been set in the tower after they had stood on public display on the tzompantli.Roughly six meters in diameter, the tower stood on the corner of the chapel of Huitzilopochtli, Aztec god of the sun, war and human sacrifice. Its base has yet to be unearthed.There was no doubt that the tower was one of the skull edifices mentioned by Andres de Tapia, a Spanish soldier who accompanied Cortes in the 1521 conquest of Mexico, Barrera said.In his account of the campaign, de Tapia said he counted tens of thousands of skulls at what became known as the Huey Tzompantli.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/595901b7180000380067274f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"MEXICO CITY, July 1 (Reuters) - A tower of human skulls unearthed beneath the heart of Mexico City has raised new questions about the culture of sacrifice in the Aztec Empire after crania of women and children surfaced among the hundreds embedded in the forbidding structure.Archaeologists have found more than 650 skulls caked in lime and thousands of fragments in the cylindrical edifice near the site of the Templo Mayor, one of the main temples in the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan, which later became Mexico City.The tower is believed to form part of the Huey Tzompantli, a massive array of skulls that struck fear into the Spanish conquistadores when they captured the city under Hernan Cortes, and mentioned the structure in contemporary accounts.Historians relate how the severed heads of captured warriors adorned tzompantli, or skull racks, found in a number of Mesoamerican cultures before the Spanish conquest.But the archaeological dig in the bowels of old Mexico City that began in 2015 suggests that picture was not complete.“We were expecting just men, obviously young men, as warriors would be, and the thing about the women and children is that you’d think they wouldn’t be going to war,” said Rodrigo Bolanos, a biological anthropologist investigating the find.“Something is happening that we have no record of, and this is really new, a first in the Huey Tzompantli,” he added.Raul Barrera, one of the archaeologists working at the site alongside the huge Metropolitan Cathedral built over the Templo Mayor, said the skulls would have been set in the tower after they had stood on public display on the tzompantli.Roughly six meters in diameter, the tower stood on the corner of the chapel of Huitzilopochtli, Aztec god of the sun, war and human sacrifice. Its base has yet to be unearthed.There was no doubt that the tower was one of the skull edifices mentioned by Andres de Tapia, a Spanish soldier who accompanied Cortes in the 1521 conquest of Mexico, Barrera said.In his account of the campaign, de Tapia said he counted tens of thousands of skulls at what became known as the Huey Tzompantli. Barrera said 676 skulls had so far been found, and that the number would rise as excavations went on.The Aztecs and other Mesoamerican peoples performed ritualistic human sacrifices as offerings to the sun.(Writing by Dave Graham; Editing by Matthew Lewis)"

The rape victim was reportedly attacked during a performance by Swedish artist and event headliner Håkan Hellström on Friday. Other performers at this year’s event included American rock band The Killers, DJ duo The Chainsmokers, and Alesso, the Swedish House DJ.In light of the reports, festival organizer FKP Scorpio said Saturday it was cancelling Bravalla 2018. “Words cannot describe how incredibly sad we are about this, and we most seriously regret and condemn this,” said a press release on the festival’s website. “This is not f-ing okay. We do not accept this at our festival.” The organizer added that though it had done “everything in our power” to create a safe festival experience, “some men — because we are talking about men — apparently can’t behave.

Rand Paul (R-Ky.), one of the main conservative critics of the bill as currently written, suggested on the same show the legislation should be junked and process of writing it begun anew.“I don’t think we’re getting anywhere with the bill we have,” Paul said. “We’re at an impasse.”Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell delayed a vote until after the recess, saying he and his leadership team are “still working toward getting at least 50 people in a comfortable place” to vote for the bill.Paul argued that the Senate should pass two bills ― one to repeal the Affordable Care Act that President Barack Obama shepherded through Congress, and another to replace it with the GOP’s alternative. Paul said the current bill “has become the kitchen sink,” and is “lit up like a Christmas tree full of billion-dollar ornaments.”Paul did say that he hopes the Senate can get health care legislation passed before Congress takes its August recess.

The term, which the Oxford English Dictionary last month noted is derived from African-American vernacular, was instead about sleep and staying awake, in the literal sense. The questions’ answers included melatonin, caffeine, and the stimulant product NoDoz.Obviously, Twitter had a lot to stay on the matter, with some viewers suggesting that the category was “disappointing” and suffered a “major miss.”Hey, you can’t win them all, and to be fair, puns and wordplay in the show’s categories are to be expected.That said, there have been far more cringeworthy moments on the show, like their past “What Women Want” category ― whose answers included a vacuum cleaner, pilates, and jeans that make butts look good ― and that time a contestant mispronounced 2Pac’s name as “Two Pack.”"

The show, which won five Tony Awards, broke fresh ground in 2015 as Broadway’s first musical to feature a lesbian protagonist. As was the case on Broadway, three actresses ― Carly Gold, Abby Corrigan and Kate Shindle ― portray Bechdel as a child, a college student and a middle-aged woman, respectively, in the current touring company of the musical. But it’s the casting of Shindle, who was crowned Miss America in 1998, that’s drawing the heat. On June 22, a 19-year-old performing arts student, identified only as Sinister Woman, published a lengthy blog accusing the “Fun Home” creative team of toning down the character’s “butchness” for Shindle’s benefit. She drew particular attention to the character’s costume, which had been changed from the one that Beth Malone, who starred in the original Broadway production, wore in the same role. “Of course I can only speculate, but I must wonder if former Miss America would... persuade [producers] to change her costuming to be more typically feminine,” she wrote. “A butch lesbian just isn’t relatable to most theatergoers, but a short-haired feminine lesbian might make the cut for tugging on those liberal heartstrings.” A June 25 post on the official “Fun Home” Facebook page that linked to a Washington Post interview with Shindle drew more than 500 comments from fans, many of whom agreed with Sinister Woman’s assessment. “I am a gay woman who doesn’t recognize myself in the NEW Alison. Very disappointed,” one person wrote. “Shame on the producers for selling out!” Added another: “De-butching Alison reminds me of when family members tell their tomboy child to ‘not dress so mannish’ and to ‘act like a girl.’ It’s honestly insulting.” On Friday, “Fun Home” lyricist Lisa Kron addressed the criticism in an open letter on the musical’s official site. “From the moment I began adapting Alison Bechdel’s book, I felt a keen responsibility not just to retain the undiluted butchness of the main character,” Kron, who co-wrote the musical with Jeanine Tesori and is openly gay, explained, “but also to give audiences a way to see the same swaggery, sexy power I see when I look at a butch woman.” The decision to change the costume, she added, was simply due to Swindle’s figure, which differed greatly from Malone’s. “She’s a curvy amazon, and on her frame the effect of this same costume was completely different – somehow neither swaggery butch nor, thanks to her character-appropriate sports bra, quite sporty femme either,” Kron wrote. She then added, “I love Kate’s version of Alison. I feel good about the change in her costume. You may disagree. But was this decision, or any other, ever made to ‘de-butchify’ the show? No way.

It was then retweeted by the president’s official White House account, @POTUS, following a week of renewed attacks against CNN and other news outlets, which Trump has branded as “fake news” and “fraudulent.”“What about GOP leaders? What about Republican leaders?” CNN media reporter Brian Stelter asked Sunday about responses to the tweet. “Where’s [House Speaker] Paul Ryan? Where’s [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell? Are GOP leaders going to speak up about these attacks against the media?”As of Sunday evening, neither Ryan nor McConnell’s offices had responded to HuffPost’s requests for comment on Trump’s tweet.Trump’s behavior and outbursts ―which likely would have sunk the political careers of anyone else ― have spurred GOP criticism in the past. But the party’s leaders have done little to try to stop him, and have remained supportive of his presidency.The latest example came last week, after Trump attacked MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski in a series of sexist tweets. Republicans on Capitol Hill responded with various iterations of concern. They have also frequently lamented that Trump’s tweeting habits distract from the GOP’s legislative agenda. But their day-to-day dealings with Trump go on, seemingly unaffected by the controversies.Trump has time and time again undermined the free press, which has galvanized opposition to the media among his supporters. During his White House campaign, he regularly incited protests and violence against reporters at his raucous rallies. As president, he and his administration have embarked on an anti-media crusade, keeping the press and the public in the dark, sometimes on even basic matters.Trump’s treatment of the media has prompted press freedom groups to lower America’s ranking in their global assessments of press freedom, with some equating the level of press freedom in the U.S. to that of authoritarian nations.Still, White House deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Thursday falsely insisted the president “in no way, form or fashion has ever promoted or encouraged violence,” as she defended Trump’s tweets targeting Brzezinski.Earlier last week, after 3 CNN journalists resigned in the wake of the network retracting a story involving a Trump transition official, the president and White House aides treated the incident as a victory and used it to continue their attacks on “fake news.”He also assailed the “fake media” during a July 4th event honoring military veterans on Saturday night.Responding to Trump’s tweet during a television appearance Sunday morning, White House homeland security adviser Thomas Bossert initially appeared stunned by the video, but proceeded to defend it anyway. He told ABC’s Martha Raddatz that “no one would perceive that as a threat.”“I’m proud of the president for developing a Twitter and a social media platform where he can talk directly to the American people,” Bossert said."

Ripley’s, headquartered in Orlando, Florida, runs several Believe It Or Not! museums and events.The auction house provided no information on the droid lover who scooped up R2-D2 on Wednesday. The 43-inch-tall R2-D2 was compiled of parts used during filming of the original “Star Wars” trilogy, AP reported. The lightsaber is a “Star Wars” icon. Luke relied on his trusty sword — which Obi-Wan Kenobi characterized as an “elegant weapon” from a “more civilized age” before the dark times — in his final confrontation with the man he eventually discovers is his father, Darth Vadar.

The OSTP advises the White House “on the effects of science and technology on domestic and international affairs,” according to its website.When asked about the alleged vacancies, White House deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told HuffPost on Saturday the report was false.“This is not true,” Sanders said in an email. “Sadly, someone was more concerned about attacking [President Donald Trump] than getting their story straight.”A White House official familiar with the OSTP told HuffPost that there are 12 staffers currently working in the science division, despite the report that said otherwise. The official, who requested anonymity to discuss the matter, also said there are 35 people total on staff in the OSTP.The official said the work of previous science division workers had been passed on to new staffers who have expertise in similar areas of study.The three science division staffers who finished up on Friday included Elle Celeste, who was previously a biomedical and forensic science expert for the White House. The White House official told HuffPost that Friday’s departures were “a matter of contract expiration.”After departing from the OSTP, Celeste tweeted her final goodbyes, along with a photo of the science division placard with text saying “science division out. mic drop.”Kumar Garg, another former OSTP employee who left his job in January, tweeted that Friday’s departures mean there are “zero” people left in the division. He was the OSTP’s assistant director for Learning and Innovation, but said he left his position because of Trump after serving for nearly eight years. “I made the decision to leave at the end of President Obama’s term because I disagreed strongly with the policy goals of the incoming Administration,” Garg told HuffPost in an email.The OSTP serves a critical role in the presidency, providing direct advice to the president on all science and technology topics, including all public health and national security issues that may emerge ― for example, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2011 and the Ebola crisis of 2014 ― according to Garg.“Currently, nearly all major positions (Science Advisor, OSTP Director, CTO, OSTP Associate Directors) remain unfilled, as well as general staff positions,” Garg said. “As such, this Administration is flying blind on a range of science and technology issues.”The Trump administration has faced sharp criticism from the scientific community. In April, tens of thousands of people participated in an estimated 600 March for Science events across the country in protest of the administration’s stance on various issues.Trump, who has called climate change a “hoax” orchestrated by the Chinese, has proposed massive budget cuts for federal programs including the Environmental Protection Agency, NASA, the Department of Energy’s office of science, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.After Trump revealed his 2018 budget proposal in March, Jeffrey Mervis, science policy reporter for Science Magazine wrote that it “confirms two things that U.S. scientists have long suspected: The new president is no fan of research, and his administration has no overarching strategy for funding science.” The White House has also yet to appoint one of the most influential science roles in federal government, the presidential science adviser, who heads the OSTP. When asked about that vacancy, the White House official familiar with the matter told HuffPost that “several very promising candidates for OSTP director” are under consideration.Celeste did not immediately responded to a request for comment from HuffPost.This story has been updated to include comment from Garg."
66,HEALTHY LIVING,Are You Emotionally Intelligent? Here’s How To Know For Sure,"Dr. Travis Bradberry, ContributorTalentSmart, President and 'Emotional Intelligence 2.0,' Coauthor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/are-you-emotionally-intelligent-heres-how-to-know_us_5952b6b8e4b0c85b96c65d4e,Emotional intelligence is the “something” in each of us that is a bit intangible.,2017-07-02,"<p>Since good EQ tests aren’t free, Dr. Travis Bradberry analyzed the data from the million-plus people TalentSmart has tested in order to identify the behaviors that are sure signs you have a high EQ.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5952b6f81500004d1f900622.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When emotional intelligence (EQ) first appeared to the masses, it served as the missing link in a peculiar finding: people with average IQs outperform those with the highest IQs 70 percent of the time. This anomaly threw a massive wrench into the broadly held assumption that IQ was the sole source of success.Decades of research now point to emotional intelligence as being the critical factor that sets star performers apart from the rest of the pack. The connection is so strong that 90 percent of top performers have high emotional intelligence.Emotional intelligence is the “something” in each of us that is a bit intangible. It affects how we manage behavior, navigate social complexities, and make personal decisions to achieve positive results.Despite the significance of EQ, its intangible nature makes it very difficult to know how much you have and what you can do to improve if you’re lacking. You can always take a scientifically validated test, such as the one that comes with the Emotional Intelligence 2.0 book.Unfortunately, quality (scientifically valid) EQ tests aren’t free. So, I’ve analyzed the data from the million-plus people TalentSmart has tested in order to identify the behaviors that are the hallmarks of a high EQ. What follows are sure signs that you have a high EQ.1. You Have a Robust Emotional VocabularyAll people experience emotions, but it is a select few who can accurately identify them as they occur. Our research shows that only 36 percent of people can do this, which is problematic because unlabeled emotions often go misunderstood, which leads to irrational choices and counterproductive actions.People with high EQs master their emotions because they understand them, and they use an extensive vocabulary of feelings to do so. While many people might describe themselves as simply feeling “bad,” emotionally intelligent people can pinpoint whether they feel “irritable,” “frustrated,” “downtrodden,” or “anxious.” The more specific your word choice, the better insight you have into exactly how you are feeling, what caused it, and what you should do about it.2. You’re Curious About PeopleIt doesn’t matter if they’re introverted or extroverted, emotionally intelligent people are curious about everyone around them. This curiosity is the product of empathy, one of the most significant gateways to a high EQ. The more you care about other people and what they’re going through, the more curiosity you’re going to have about them.3. You Embrace ChangeEmotionally intelligent people are flexible and are constantly adapting. They know that fear of change is paralyzing and a major threat to their success and happiness. They look for change that is lurking just around the corner, and they form a plan of action should these changes occur.4. You Know Your Strengths and WeaknessesEmotionally intelligent people don’t just understand emotions; they know what they’re good at and what they’re terrible at. They also know who pushes their buttons and the environments (both situations and people) that enable them to succeed. Having a high EQ means you know your strengths and you know how to lean into them and use them to your full advantage while keeping your weaknesses from holding you back.5. You’re a Good Judge of CharacterMuch of emotional intelligence comes down to social awareness; the ability to read other people, know what they’re about, and understand what they’re going through. Over time, this skill makes you an exceptional judge of character. People are no mystery to you. You know what they’re all about and understand their motivations, even those that lie hidden beneath the surface.6. You Are Difficult to OffendIf you have a firm grasp of whom you are, it’s difficult for someone to say or do something that gets your goat. Emotionally intelligent people are self-confident and open-minded, which creates a pretty thick skin. You may even poke fun at yourself or let other people make jokes about you because you are able to mentally draw the line between humor and degradation.7. You Know How to Say No (to Yourself and Others)Emotional intelligence means knowing how to exert self-control. You delay gratification, and you avoid impulsive action. Research conducted at the University of California, San Francisco, shows that the more difficulty that you have saying no, the more likely you are to experience stress, burnout, and even depression. Saying no is indeed a major self-control challenge for many people. “No” is a powerful word that you should not be afraid to wield. When it’s time to say no, emotionally intelligent people avoid phrases such as “I don’t think I can” or “I’m not certain.” Saying no to a new commitment honors your existing commitments and gives you the opportunity to successfully fulfill them.8. You Let Go of MistakesEmotionally intelligent people distance themselves from their mistakes, but do so without forgetting them. By keeping their mistakes at a safe distance, yet still handy enough to refer to, they are able to adapt and adjust for future success. It takes refined self-awareness to walk this tightrope between dwelling and remembering. Dwelling too long on your mistakes makes you anxious and gun shy, while forgetting about them completely makes you bound to repeat them. The key to balance lies in your ability to transform failures into nuggets of improvement. This creates the tendency to get right back up every time you fall down.9. You Give and Expect Nothing in ReturnWhen someone gives you something spontaneously, without expecting anything in return, this leaves a powerful impression. For example, you might have an interesting conversation with someone about a book, and when you see them again a month later, you show up with the book in hand. Emotionally intelligent people build strong relationships because they are constantly thinking about others.10. You Don’t Hold GrudgesThe negative emotions that come with holding onto a grudge are actually a stress response. Just thinking about the event sends your body into fight-or-flight mode, a survival mechanism that forces you to stand up and fight or run for the hills when faced with a threat. When the threat is imminent, this reaction is essential to your survival, but when the threat is ancient history, holding onto that stress wreaks havoc on your body and can have devastating health consequences over time. In fact, researchers at Emory University have shown that holding onto stress contributes to high blood pressure and heart disease. Holding onto a grudge means you’re holding onto stress, and emotionally intelligent people know to avoid this at all costs. Letting go of a grudge not only makes you feel better now but can also improve your health.11. You Neutralize Toxic PeopleDealing with difficult people is frustrating and exhausting for most. High EQ individuals control their interactions with toxic people by keeping their feelings in check. When they need to confront a toxic person, they approach the situation rationally. They identify their own emotions and don’t allow anger or frustration to fuel the chaos. They also consider the difficult person’s standpoint and are able to find solutions and common ground. Even when things completely derail, emotionally intelligent people are able to take the toxic person with a grain of salt to avoid letting him or her bring them down.12. You Don’t Seek PerfectionEmotionally intelligent people won’t set perfection as their target because they know that it doesn’t exist. Human beings, by our very nature, are fallible. When perfection is your goal, you’re always left with a nagging sense of failure that makes you want to give up or reduce your effort. You end up spending your time lamenting what you failed to accomplish and what you should have done differently instead of moving forward, excited about what you’ve achieved and what you will accomplish in the future.13. You Appreciate What You HaveTaking time to contemplate what you’re grateful for isn’t merely the right thing to do; it also improves your mood because it reduces the stress hormone cortisol by 23 percent. Research conducted at the University of California, Davis, found that people who worked daily to cultivate an attitude of gratitude experienced improved mood, energy, and physical well-being. It’s likely that lower levels of cortisol played a major role in this.14. You DisconnectTaking regular time off the grid is a sign of a high EQ because it helps you to keep your stress under control and to live in the moment. When you make yourself available to your work 24/7, you expose yourself to a constant barrage of stressors. Forcing yourself offline and even—gulp!—turning off your phone gives your body and mind a break. Studies have shown that something as simple as an e-mail break can lower stress levels. Technology enables constant communication and the expectation that you should be available 24/7. It is extremely difficult to enjoy a stress-free moment outside of work when an e-mail that will change your train of thought and get you thinking (read: stressing) about work can drop onto your phone at any moment.15. You Limit Your Caffeine IntakeDrinking excessive amounts of caffeine triggers the release of adrenaline, and adrenaline is the source of the fight-or-flight response. The fight-or-flight mechanism sidesteps rational thinking in favor of a faster response to ensure survival. This is great when a bear is chasing you, but not so great when you’re responding to a curt e-mail. When caffeine puts your brain and body into this hyper-aroused state of stress, your emotions overrun your behavior. Caffeine’s long half-life ensures you stay this way as it takes its sweet time working its way out of your body. High-EQ individuals know that caffeine is trouble, and they don’t let it get the better of them.16. You Get Enough SleepIt’s difficult to overstate the importance of sleep to increasing your emotional intelligence and managing your stress levels. When you sleep, your brain literally recharges, shuffling through the day’s memories and storing or discarding them (which causes dreams) so that you wake up alert and clearheaded. High-EQ individuals know that their self-control, attention, and memory are all reduced when they don’t get enough—or the right kind—of sleep. So, they make sleep a top priority.17. You Stop Negative Self-Talk in Its TracksThe more you ruminate on negative thoughts, the more power you give them. Most of our negative thoughts are just that—thoughts, not facts. When it feels like something always or never happens, this is just your brain’s natural tendency to perceive threats (inflating the frequency or severity of an event). Emotionally intelligent people separate their thoughts from the facts in order to escape the cycle of negativity and move toward a positive, new outlook.18. You Won’t Let Anyone Limit Your JoyWhen your sense of pleasure and satisfaction are derived from the opinions of other people, you are no longer the master of your own happiness. When emotionally intelligent people feel good about something that they’ve done, they won’t let anyone’s opinions or snide remarks take that away from them. While it’s impossible to turn off your reactions to what others think of you, you don’t have to compare yourself to others, and you can always take people’s opinions with a grain of salt. That way, no matter what other people are thinking or doing, your self-worth comes from within.Want to increase emotional intelligence in your workplace?

That’s all. It’s not scary, even though that word used to be really, really scary to me.”Morales ends her piece by noting that “even though me telling you I’m queer might not be a big deal these days, things are still pretty bad out there for people like me.” She references the dangerous conditions for gay men in Chechnya and the 2016 Pulse nightclub massacre in Florida that claimed 49 lives, most of whom were queer and people of color. “I think it’s important that I tell you that this familiar face you see on your TV is the Q part of LGBTQ, so that if you didn’t know someone who was queer before, you do now,” she writes before offering some wise words to “any scared kids out there.” “You’re not weird. You’re not bad. You’re not unholy. ... You are an essential part of the world just as you were created, and I want to see you. The real you.”Read Morales’ full essay here."

Bill Cassidy of Louisiana made his comments in a pre-recorded segment on NBC’s “Meet the Press” program that aired on the morning that Trump tweeted one of his most inflammatory tweets yet. In the tweet, the president fantasizes about beating up journalists.“Our focus cannot be on” Trump’s tweets, Cassidy said. “Our focus has to be on that kitchen-table family paying $20-, $30- and $40,000 for their premiums, wondering how they’re going to make ends meet.”Host Chuck Todd noted that it’s the president himself turning attention aside from the debate on health care, as he did late last week with tweets attacking Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough, hosts of MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” show.“I get so frustrated when we get focused on tweets,” Cassidy said. “I wake up in the morning and I read about the [Louisiana State University] Tigers. I don’t read about the president’s tweets. And I think we need to have more of a focus on that family [worried about health insurance costs}, not on a president’s tweets.”Cassidy, a medical doctor in his first term in the Senate, said that Trump’s tweets on the “Morning Joe” hosts were “reprehensible,” but that he tries to not pay much attention to them.“I liken it to when I have a patient in the intensive care unit. I’m focused on that patient. I walk around all day long thinking about what I can do better,” he said. "
71,HEALTHY LIVING,Brain-Eating Amoeba Found In Louisiana Tap Water; People Warned To Avoid Water In Nose,Dominique Mosbergen,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/brain-eating-amoeba-louisiana_us_5958feeae4b02734df32f396,Traces of Naegleria fowleri was found during routine testing in two water systems.,2017-07-02,"This photomicrograph shows brain tissue infected with Naegleria fowleri, commonly known as brain-eating amoeba.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59590c4b2100003400fc515b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Louisiana’s Department of Health confirmed this week that brain-eating amoeba had been found in two water systems in the state. Traces of Naegleria fowleri, a single-celled organism that can cause a rare, but fatal, brain disease, was found during routine water testing of Ouachita Parish’s North Monroe Water System and Terrebonne Parish’s Schriever Water System. Health officials assured residents that the tap water in these parishes are still safe to drink, but warned people to avoid getting any of it in their noses.Naegleria fowleri infections occur when contaminated water enters the nose and the amoeba travels to the brain where it destroys brain tissue ― a disease known as primary amebic meningoencephalitis, or PAM. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, early symptoms of PAM can be similar to those of bacterial meningitis, including headache, fever and nausea. As the disease progresses, stiff neck, seizures and hallucinations can occur. In most cases, death soon follows. The fatality rate of the infection is over 97 percent in the United States, though it’s a rare affliction with only 40 cases reported in the country between 2007 and 2016. Drinking contaminated tap water cannot lead to infection, stressed the CDC ― but using it for nasal irrigation or accidentally getting it into your nose can. Of the 40 people in the U.S. infected since 2007, four cases were caused by contaminated tap water. Nasal irrigation was the culprit for three infections; the fourth involved a person using a backyard slip-n-slide. According to the CDC, the majority of infections in the U.S. have involved people swimming or diving in warm freshwater bodies like lakes and rivers. The Louisiana health department issued a list of warnings this week for residents to avoid infection. This includes flushing out pipes by allowing shower taps and hoses to run for five minutes before use, and using “only boiled and cooled, distilled or sterile water for making sinus rinse solutions for neti pots or performing ritual ablutions.” Louisiana health officials said on Thursday that they’ve told the two water systems to use the “free chlorine method” for 60 days to kill any remaining amoeba. Free chlorine is a strong disinfectant known to be effective at killing parasites.Officials advised residents to continue following all precautions “until testing no longer confirms the presence of the amoeba in the water system. The water system will notify residents when that occurs,” the health department said. Residents in the areas affected expressed concern about the infected water. “It’s scary,” Terrebonne resident Bernadee Pitre told local WWL-TV this week. “[I’m] definitely going to be more careful about that.”"
72,PARENTS,Chiropractor's Car Seat Carrier Hack May Just Change Your Life,Carla Herreria,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chiropractor-car-seat-hack_us_59581722e4b0da2c7323f7ca,Your shoulders and hips will thank you.,2017-07-02,"Chiropractor Emily Puente demonstrates the differences between the typical way of carrying a car seat, left, and the healthier way.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/595832ca2100003400fc50b8.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Parents of infants know that carrying a clunky car seat carrier is an arduous task. Unfortunately, parenting often requires multitasking, forcing adults to lug one around while going about their day.Despair no more, parents. One chiropractor is changing the baby seat game. Emily Puente of Bridge Family Chiropractic in Mansfield, Texas, posted a video in April revealing her unconventional hack that relieves pressure on the shoulders and hips. The video was so helpful it went viral this week after Distractify shared Puente’s tip with its 3.6 million followers. As seen in the video below, Puente first squats down so that she can use her knees ― not her back ― to help her lift the carrier, which is facing backward. Then, she loops her hand through one side of the car seat carrier’s handle.Once her arm is through the loop, she flips her palm face down and presses it against the carrier, using her hand to hold the joint of the handle that connects to the carrier. When she stands back up, Puente’s arm is looped through the vertical part of the carrier’s handle.This technique, Puente says, is a lot easier than letting the top of the handle rest in the crook of the elbow, which strains the upper back, shoulder and hip.“As soon as we switch to this [technique], it’s a completely different change in how I’m using my body to be able to use and distribute weight from this carrier [when] carrying it around.”Puente says that this method of carrying a car seat is better for your body, but she warned that it’s not possible on all car seat carrier models.  “It has been brought to my attention that one viewer experienced discomfort when attempting this maneuver,” Puente recently wrote in an updated post.“I suggest being cleared by your medical professional prior to trying any new regimen if you would like to ensure you are fit to perform actions like the one shown here.”After Puente’s friend showed her this technique, the chiropractor was mind-blown.“I thought, ‘Hey! I never knew that before.

Most recently, the city of New Orleans toppled four statues honoring the Confederacy. This has incensed and energized militia groups and white supremacists across the country, who claim Confederate symbols represent heritage and history, not hate. In May, white supremacists showed up with torches at a monument to Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee in Charlottesville, Virginia, after the city moved to take it down. Saturday’s rally in Gettysburg showed pro-Confederate activists increasingly agitated, armed, and itching for a fight ― even when there is no one to clash with them.

The rumors mobilized various far-right groups, who secured permits from the National Park Service to show up en masse to the battlefield, setting the stage for what they thought would be a dramatic showdown between the opposing fringe elements of U.S. politics. But the central Pennsylvania chapter of Antifa told local newspapers last week that it never intended to gather at Gettysburg. The rumors, the group told HuffPost in a Facebook message, were the work of online trolls. One such tale said Antifa members were going to urinate on Confederate gravestones. One problem: There aren’t any Confederate gravestones to desecrate. Although some Confederate soldiers are buried at Gettysburg, their final resting places aren’t marked.Still, efforts to quell the rumors didn’t stop anti-government militia groups from across the country ― including West Virginia, Michigan, Nebraska and California ― from showing up Saturday. “Our main purpose is just to defend the historical parts of the city here and stop them from being destroyed and keep people who aren’t part of anything ... safe,” said a 27-year-old who would give his name only as Thor and who said he was a veteran of the war in Afghanistan.He said he was aware that Antifa likely wasn’t going to show, but that he felt compelled to be there, just in case. Thor, a Gettysburg-area resident and member of the anti-government militia group the Three Percenters, wore an ammunition belt around a bulletproof vest. The sleeves of his camouflage uniform were rolled up, revealing the word “INFIDEL” tattooed to his arm. Asked what he thought about all the Confederate symbols being removed from public property across the U.S., Thor didn’t mince words. “It pisses me off,” he said. The assembled groups’ hatred for Antifa Saturday was surpassed only by their anger at the growing movement to remove Confederate symbols from public property.Ted Fields, a Sons of Confederate Veterans leader wearing a black leather biker vest, addressed the crowd using a megaphone and asserted that the dismantling of Confederate monuments could lead to the decimation of America itself. “I believe their master plan is once they get us used to taking down some monuments here and there in some liberal cities, then they’re gonna try it out here and see if that works,” he said. “The next thing you know, they’re going to take our Constitution and say you know what? That was written by slave-holders, it’s racist, let’s get rid of it and become a communist nation. I don’t want that on my watch.”The crowd cheered.A woman named Jenny Lee, who claimed to be Robert E. Lee’s 3rd great grandniece, implored the crowd not to be bowed by political correctness. “We must never back down or be intimidated by the antics of the ignorant,” she said. “And all the safety-pin-wearing, easily offended, butt-hurt, temper-tantrum-throwing, vagina-hat-wearing, face-covered, commie fascists can kiss my ass.”Lee was forceful in telling the crowd that the Confederacy ― and by extension, everyone gathered at the rally ― wasn’t racist. The Civil War, she said, wasn’t about slavery. (It was.) Plus, she added to great applause, thousands of blacks fought for the South, neglecting to mention that they were forced to do so.As the rally concluded, the sound of cannons could be heard in the distance, as Civil War re-enactors not associated with the pro-Confederate rally shot off blank rounds, smoke billowing out across a different part of the battlefield. Actors in blue and gray uniforms played dead and injured. But the only person actually shot Saturday in Gettysburg with a real bullet was a 23-year-old militia group member named Benjamin Hornberger, of Shippensburg, Pennsylvania. According to U.S. Park police, Hornberger triggered his revolver when the flag pole he was carrying bumped against his gun holster. The bullet went into his leg. Police say officers quickly applied a tourniquet, likely saving his life. According to PennLive, Hornberger talked to paramedics and “seemed in good spirits.”America does not do a good job of tracking incidents of hate and bias.

75,BLACK VOICES,"Privilege Is Inhumane, And Appropriation Is One Of Its Strongest Weapons","P.L. Thomas, ContributorP.L. Thomas , professor of education (Furman University, Green...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/resisting-cultural-appropriation-a-human-response_us_5958dbbee4b0326c0a8d115d,Downplaying the violence in cultural appropriation is dismissive and ignorant to the ways cultures express and sustain themselves.,2017-07-02,<p>U.S. pop culture simultaneously appropriates cultures from marginalized groups and ultimately allows whites to profit from and trivialize those cultural attributes.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5958dbe31500002900bfbcca.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When I posted K. Tempest Bradford’s argument “that cultural appropriation is indefensible,” the first comment I received (from a white man) suggested cultural appropriation is unavoidable, mostly discounting Bradford’s challenges.Once I replied, the same person added: “The solution is to change the power relationships, not to erect artificial cultural walls.”First, when so-called racial minorities speak against inequity, whites often fail to listen, shouting over or offering the condescending “yes, but”—in the same way men correct and marginalize when women confront sexism and misogyny.In the situation above, the typical white male moderate or even self-proclaimed progressive response is at play, something like “Let’s work toward a color-blind society!”This ploy fails on several levels.As noted already, it fails because the response replaces a willingness to listen, to value the perspective, and then to act in alliance.But more broadly, the premise is also flawed because the goal is not to be a color-blind society or to eradicate cultural (or racial, or gender) distinctions, but to identify those differences as worthy of equal celebration and to insure that those differences never stand as markers for injustice, inequity, and dehumanization.As Bradford asserts, cultural appropriation must always be resisted because the U.S. is a capitalistic and materialistic society in which each person’s dignity and the humanity of that person are inextricably tied to any identifiable group with which they are connected.Further, the U.S. remains incredibly inequitable and unjust along race, class, and gender lines (among others).Entertainers such as Elvis Presley or Pat Boone at mid-twentieth century, for example, were allowed to benefit and profit greatly on the musical styles of blacks who were directly excluded from the same financial and entertainment opportunities.More recently, Vanilla Ice and Eminem represent the lingering power of cultural appropriation despite the Civil Rights movement and greater access to wealth and fame by blacks.And the entrenched negligence and insensitivity of sport mascots ― such as the Washington Redskins or Florida State Seminoles ― stand as bold symbols that white privilege continues to trump genuine appreciation of diversity and essential human dignity within capitalism.One key point in this debate, however, is understanding the basic human response to cultural appropriation among marginalized and oppressed groups. For those marginalized groups to cling to and defend their culture is a human response to the inhumanity of privilege.Blacks, for example, are still daily told directly and indirectly that they as humans do not matter as much, do not count as much as whites (lower pay even with equal experience and education, greater incarceration without greater criminality, disproportionately higher rates of being shot and killed by police, etc.), and then, elements of black culture routinely are appropriated by whites as long as whites benefit and profit.Throwing Shade in 2017 as a TV show hosted by two whites?If we dig deep enough, we may well have to face that beneath racism and cultural appropriation we will unearth that capitalism is the root of all evil—monetizing everything above human dignity.As long as we allow our larger culture to be grounded in the amorality of capitalism and materialism (supply and demand trumps ethics or morality), then we are doomed to inequity and injustice, in the form of racism, sexism, classism, etc.; those individuals and groups suffering that inequity, then, must reach for their humanity and dignity by clinging to that which the dominant group deems valuable.If tearing down “artificial cultural walls” is a valid goal (and I am skeptical it is), then the only truly progressive response by those with race and gender privilege is to listen to those who resist cultural appropriation (and all inequity), to accept that resistance, and then to offer their privilege in solidarity to end the injustice—not to shout over or offer yet another bitter “yes, but.”"
76,POLITICS,Suit Seeks To Force Alabama To Inform People About Restored Voting Rights,Sam Levine,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alabama-moral-turpitude-voting-rights-felons_us_5957e7c6e4b02734df32c2c2,"“The state is responsible for correcting the confusion that has wrongly disenfranchised voters for decades.""",2017-07-01,"Alabama's Republican secretary of state, John Merrill, told HuffPost in June that he wouldn't take action to specifically help individuals disenfranchised under an old felon voting law understand that they may now have the right to vote.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5957e93e1500002000bfbbe8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A federal court could force Alabama to educate eligible voters about a pivotal change to a state law that could potentially restore the voting rights of thousands of convicted felons. The change could come as a result of a motion for a preliminary injunction filed in an ongoing lawsuit over felon voting qualifications in Alabama. The state had blocked people convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” from voting since 1901 but never explicitly defined what constituted an offense of moral turpitude, although the law was limited to felonies in the 1990s. The ambiguity gave local election officials broad discretion to deny people the right to vote. Alabama earned praise when it passed a law in May clarifying which felonies constituted “moral turpitude” and would therefore block people from voting, but Secretary of State John Merrill (R) told HuffPost in June that his office wouldn’t take any action to make sure the thousands of people affected by the law actually know about it. The change is sure to cause massive confusion, especially because local election officials had been granted broad discretion to deny people the right to vote under the old law. This means some eligible voters may have been told in the past that they couldn’t vote and may continue to think they can’t.Plaintiffs in the case include a man who was blocked from voting because he was convicted of receiving property in 2003, was released from state prison in 2007 and completed his parole in 2016. In another case, a woman was told last year that she couldn’t vote because of a conviction two decades ago for writing bad checks.In the motion, the Campaign Legal Center, which is representing 10 plaintiffs suing the state over the moral turpitude law, said Merrill had not taken any meaningful action to advertise the changes to the law, such as updating his website, election forms or advising local voter registrars. With a voter registration deadline for a special election for U.S. Senate approaching at the end of July, the plaintiffs said Merrill must act to educate voters.“The state is responsible for correcting the confusion that has wrongly disenfranchised voters for decades. In order for HB 282 to have any meaningful effect, Alabama must notify voters about their right and ensure they are able to successfully cast a ballot going forward,” Danielle Lang, a lawyer at Campaign Legal Center, said in a statement. In addition to promoting the changes in eligibility, the motion asks the court to require the state to automatically reinstate and notify voters who were disqualified to vote in the last two years but are now eligible. It also requests that the state produce a comprehensive list of all individuals who had been blocked from voting because of a conviction over the last two years and implement a public education plan targeted at people with convictions.The Southern Poverty Law Center estimates that thousands of Alabamians would be affected. While the state has yet to take action, the ACLU of Alabama and Legal Services Alabama plan to hold a series of clinics over the summer to educate eligible voters about the change. "

Unlike modern stars, pop acts of her era were expected be ""basically perfect,” the former teen idol told a popular LGBT podcast, and being ""messy"" in public would have carried grave consequences.""In the '80s, especially for someone like myself, if you'd done that, that was a career ended,"" said Tiffany, who at just 14 topped global charts with her 1987 cover of ""I Think We're Alone Now."" ""As a young person, you had to be squeaky-clean.""These days, wild partying and personal turmoil in the public eye are common for youthful stars, the fiery-haired siren acknowledged. With the glut of information available about celebrities both in the news and on the internet, she told Party Foul Radio with Pollo & Pearl, the public seems far more understanding of growing pains from public figures. ""Some people will laugh at it and be like, ‘Oh, Girl! Been there, done that!’"" she shared during an extended interview on Podomatic’s No. 1 LGBTQ Podcast. ""Some people will be very mean, but most people will forget about it within the next 15 minutes, because there is something else going on.""Tiffany first burst onto the pop music scene in 1987. Her now iconic cover of a 1967 Tommy James & The Shondells hit was an immediate smash, hitting No. 1 on pop charts. Landing atop Billboard album charts, her self-titled debut also included Top 10 hit “I Saw Him Standing There,” a variation on a Beatles classic, and her second No. 1 “Could’ve Been.” A year later, sophomore set Hold an Old Friend’s Hand opened in the upper echelon of the album charts and spawned a fourth Top 10 single.“Back then, unless you were a true rock 'n roll star, you had to be perfect,” said Tiffany of the pressures teen stars faced at the time. “Nobody wants to see you without makeup. Nobody wants to see you messy. Nobody wants to know you have problems.”WATCH: Tiffany’s 1987 No 1 Single “I Think We’re Alone Now”Fortunately, times have changed – as has public perception of how stars should live their lives, Tiffany said. During the nearly hour-long conversation, which traced her early career, love for animals and discussed her LGBTQ fan base at length, she stated modern musicians are even appreciated because of their trials and tribulations. “Now, being dramatic and having a little bit of grit in your life is newsworthy,” Tiffany noted. “Sometimes when somebody is hurting, have had failures, and they throw it out there…I see fans rallying around them even more, which is awesome,” she stated. “As an artist, I can say when you feel that love, you don't feel like you're alone. “People understand,” she continued. “You've put your heart into something, and it doesn't do well. Or you've put your heart into a relationship, and now after all these years, you're getting a divorce. These are real issues that people can relate to. Before, we just wrote about them in our music.”After stepping away from the music industry for a number of years to raise son Elijah, now 25, Tiffany is again performing full-time. The “A Million Miles Tour"" — promoting her recently-released album of the same name — just returned from the United Kingdom, is criss-crossing North America and has upcoming dates in Malaysia and beyond. LISTEN: Tiffany’s New Single “Can’t Stop Falling”When not on the road or in the studio ― new single “Can’t Stop Falling” was released in June ― the star has made numerous television appearances. Over the last decade, Tiffany’s appeared on Celebrity Fit Club, Celebrity Wife Swap and Hulk Hogan’s Celebrity Championship Wrestling. Tiffany even landed a starring role in campy SyFy feature Mega Python vs. Gatoroid. The film heavily capitalized on her alleged “feud” with fellow ’80s teen sensation Debbie (nee, Deborah) Gibson. It was just a creation of the media and their respective record labels, she told podcast listeners, since the women scarcely knew each other at the time. However, it did help her learn a valuable lesson.“If you’re out there in the public eye, you really do have to be comfortable in your own skin,” shared Tiffany, who has spent two-thirds of her life in the spotlight to varying degrees. “You have to own your mistakes and you have to hold your head up high on the things you believe in.”It’s a message certain to ring true to her ample LGBTQ following, of whom Tiffany has become an “outspoken advocate” during the course of her career. Though initially unaware she was amassing a queer fan base, she now frequently performs at Pride festivals around the world and realizes her connection to the community extends back decades for many.“There’s something so honest about the gay audiences, whether it’s a snarky comment or a true, tears-coming-down-their-face moment while they’re listening to you sing,” she shared. “Either way, I love all of it. Those are some of the best people in my life.”From casual encounters with fans at shows to her business partner Ron Davis, who is gay, Tiffany “love[s] so many different aspects” of the LGBTQ community. According to the star, “Sometimes they can see me at my best and I can’t.”“They’re some of the most true, honest-hearted people in my life,” Tiffany concluded. “I know I can fail. I know I can have whatever moments in my life, and they don’t judge. For me, that’s timeless.”For More Information About Tiffany, Visit Her Website.Follow “Party Foul Radio” on Twitter.LISTEN: Tiffany’s Complete Interview on Party Foul Radio."

She died of injuries in a car crash in Paris on Aug. 31, 1997, that also took the lives of her friend Dodi Fayed and driver Henri Paul.Other events included a gala held in June and an exhibit at Althorp titled “Walking in Her Shoes,” which will display work from 20 recipients of The Diana Award. Visitors to Kensington Palace also honored Diana by leaving flowers, balloons and photos on the gates of Buckingham Palace."
80,HEALTHY LIVING,Activists With Disabilities Would Rather Go To Jail Than 'Die Without Medicaid',Elyse Wanshel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/disability-activists-arrested-fight-trumpcare-health-care-bill_us_595678fee4b0da2c732325ea,"In Denver, Washington and other cities, activists with disabilities plead for votes against Medicaid cuts. For many, it's resist or die.",2017-07-01,Denver police arrest Dawn Russell for refusing to leave the offices of Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) on June 29.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5956907918000035006724c4.jpeg?cache=Ohnqs6IzXB&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Ten protesters, most of whom have disabilities, were arrested Thursday in the Denver office of Republican Sen. Cory Gardner after staging a sit-in that lasted nearly 60 hours. They are part of a larger network of activists who believe they are literally fighting for their lives in their efforts to stop the Republicans’ health care bill.The activists are members of ADAPT, a national disability-rights organization, which staged a similar protest in the Washington office of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on June 22.Like the group in D.C., the Denver activists were protesting the Senate’s Better Care Reconciliation Act, which would cut $772 million from Medicaid and leave 22 million more people uninsured by 2026. The bill would also create large tax cuts for the wealthy.Gardner is one of nine Republican senators who have publicly opposed or raised concerns about the GOP bill, which would need nearly every Republican’s support in order to pass.The protesters, which included four people who use wheelchairs and two with cerebral palsy, arrived Tuesday and sat in a 15-by-12-foot room for more than two days.“It’s been really hot and cramped in here, but we’re not leaving until we get a commitment that Sen. Gardner will vote no,” Carrie Ann Lucas, 44, an attorney with the state of Colorado, told Vox on Tuesday before the arrests.On Wednesday, after protesters slept in their chairs or on the wood floor, inflatable pool toys were brought in to cushion their discomfort. They chanted, “Rather go to jail than to die without Medicaid!” while Denver police stood in the doorway of Gardner’s office and ordered them to leave.In a Facebook video created by Now This, you can hear an officer question the protesters’ motives and tactics.The group then points out how the bill could affect that officer.“God forbid you get shot on the job or something, and you’re disabled,” says one unseen protester. “Will the cops take care of you the rest of your life?”The Better Care Reconciliation Act proposes significantly slashing Medicaid funding, which 70 million low-income children, parents, the elderly and disabled Americans rely on. The House has passed a similar bill, which it called the American Health Care Act.“The American Health Care Act caps and significantly cuts Medicaid, which will greatly reduce access to medical care and home and community based services for elderly and disabled Americans who will either die or be forced into institutions,” Bruce Darling, an ADAPT organizer, wrote in a statement before the June 22 protest in McConnell’s office. “Our lives and liberty shouldn’t be stolen to give a tax break to the wealthy. That’s truly un-American.”ADAPT isn’t alone in its fight. In fact, the disability community is coming out in droves to create a resistance. There have been protests in Kansas, New Orleans and New York, where activists chanted, “No cuts to Medicaid! Save our liberties!” (Watch the video below.)In Washington, more than 40 people were arrested Wednesday in Senate office buildings. At one of the D.C. protests, in the office of Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), protesters chanted, “Kill the bill! Don’t kill me!”The protests may be having an effect. Earlier this week, McConnell agreed to postpone a vote to advance the health care bill.“You’ve had this whole community of people with disabled children or disabled adults who really got activated,” Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) told Vox on Wednesday. “They’ve really made a big difference.”Keep fighting the good fight, guys."

The shooting occurred about 2:30 a.m. Saturday at the Power Ultra Lounge.Victims were taken to multiple hospitals across the area. One of the victims initially reported to be in critical condition was upgraded later Saturday to stable. No fatalities were reported.Police said Sunday morning that no arrests had been made in connection with the shooting. The rapper who was performing at the club during the shooting ― Ricky Hampton, whose stage name is Finese 2Tymes ― was arrested early Sunday in Alabama on unrelated, outstanding charges of aggravated assault with a gun.Buckner said Saturday that authorities believe the conflict may have stemmed friction between rival local groups. He said there was no indication of terrorism.“On a Fourth of July weekend, where we wish to anticipate having fun with our friends and family, this is certainly a terrible, terrible tragedy,” Little Rock Mayor Mark Stodola said at the news conference.Buckner had said during an early morning press conference from the scene that it appeared that “some sort of dispute broke out between individuals who were inside” and that ”an exchange of gunfire took place.”Police have not released information on any suspects or confirmed whether they are looking for more than one shooter.This article has been updated with reports of more injuries and information from the police chief’s Saturday afternoon press conference.Lydia O'Connor contributed reporting."

Federal prosecutors accuse him of using fake documents to lure investors into backing his exclusive music festival on a private island.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59570f291500006303bfbb2e.jpeg?cache=X5RkuMlXnZ&ops=crop_213_425_3291_1824%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Federal agents on Friday arrested Billy McFarland, the businessman behind the botched Fyre Festival, on charges of wire fraud.McFarland’s arrest comes about two months after the event ― which was billed as an ultra-luxurious music festival on a private island in the Bahamas with gourmet catering, supermodels and tickets that cost up to $250,000 ― turned out to be a disorganized failure.When ticket holders arrived on the secluded island in late April, they were shocked to find what appeared to be a construction site with half-built tents, feral dogs and inadequate food and water.Joon Kim, the acting Manhattan U.S. attorney, said in a press release Friday that McFarland, 25, “promised a ‘life changing’ musical festival but in actuality delivered a disaster.”Federal prosecutors believe that McFarland gave investors fake documents in a successful attempt to convince them to invest more than a million dollars in his company and the festival. Wire fraud charges can carry a sentence of up to 20 years, though The New York Times reported that McFarland would likely receive a lesser sentence. McFarland and event co-founder Ja Rule went to impressive lengths to promote the Fyre Festival as a transformational music experience in paradise, recruiting models including Kendall Jenner, Bella Hadid, Hailey Baldwin and Emily Ratajkowski to promote ticket sales on their social media accounts.In a dramatic video used to promote the festival, models frolicked aboard yachts, drove jet skis and lolled on a picturesque island. High-profile acts, including Blink-182, Major Lazer and Migos, were expected to perform.A concertgoer filed a class-action lawsuit against the festival’s organizer in early May, claiming that a “lack of adequate food, water, shelter, and medical care created a dangerous and panicked situation among attendees — suddenly finding themselves stranded on a remote island without basic provisions ― that was closer to ‘The Hunger Games’ or ‘Lord of the Flies’ than Coachella.”Once attendees realized that the festival was a disaster, many headed for the airport to get off the island. The class-action lawsuit alleges that, because the festival was promoted as a “cashless event,” with attendees instructed to upload funds to a wristband instead of bringing money, many people were unable to get transportation when services asked for cash.Shortly after the festival devolved, McFarland told employees who worked on the event that they would not be getting paid for their past two weeks of work, Vice News reported in May.Federal prosecutors said that McFarland “perpetrated a scheme to defraud, induce at least two individuals” to invest an estimated $1.2 million in his company Fyre Media. McFarland also is accused of telling investors that the company earned millions of dollars from artist bookings using his company’s app, even though his company earned less than $60,000, and of showing an investor an altered image that said he owned shares of a stock worth $2.5 million when his share was valued at less than $1,500, according to federal charges.Ja Rule’s attorney, Stacey Richman, told The New York Times that the rapper has not been arrested in connection with the federal charges against McFarland. “We don’t perceive him to be a subject of this investigation,” Richman said.Aside from the federal charges, multiple lawsuits have been filed against Ja Rule and McFarland.This article has been updated to include details about the festival, the charges and the involvement of co-founder Ja Rule.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story stated that McFarland’s arrest was four months after the festival. In fact, it was about two months afterward."
