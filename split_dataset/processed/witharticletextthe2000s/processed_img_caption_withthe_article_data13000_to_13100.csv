0,QUEER VOICES,Minister Sparks Outrage After Asking People To Pray For Prince George To Be Gay,Curtis M. Wong,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/prince-george-gay-blog-post_us_5a241189e4b03c44072e2ffb,The reverend's words were quickly condemned by religious leaders.,2017-12-03,"Very Rev. Kelvin Holdsworth's comments about Prince George, 4, resurfaced in the wake of the royal engagement news.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a241e60140000b454b6b2c7.jpeg?cache=6Mg4iZRWbk&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"An Anglican minister is feeling the heat after a blog post in which he urged congregants to “pray in the privacy of their hearts” for Prince George to be gay went viral. Very Rev. Kelvin Holdsworth, who belongs to the Scottish Episcopal Church, wrote the original post nearly two years ago. (A version was reposted on Jan. 27.) His words resurfaced on Twitter and in a number of media outlets ― including The New York Times, The Guardian and Time ― last week after the 4-year-old George’s uncle, Prince Harry, announced his engagement to American actress Meghan Markle. The piece, “How to change the Church of England,” outlined Holdsworth’s take on how acceptance of same-sex marriage would be achieved. Though marriage equality was legalized in England and Wales in 2013, same-sex marriages are not recognized by the Church of England.Holdsworth suggested that marriage equality advocates pray “for the Lord to bless Prince George with a love, when he grows up, of a fine young gentleman.”“A royal wedding might sort things out remarkably easily,” he said, “though we might have to wait 25 years for that to happen.”Prince George is third in line to the British throne, following his grandfather, Charles, Prince of Wales, and his father, Prince William. The minister’s remarks were condemned on social media. Religious leaders were similarly critical. Gavin Ashenden, a former chaplain to Queen Elizabeth II and a Christian Episcopal Church missionary bishop, accused Holdsworth of using Prince George as “a gender-political football” among followers. “What is especially odd and incongruous is the fact that it is suddenly OK to pray for someone to be gay,” Ashenden told the BBC, “but totally unacceptable to pray for them to be free from being gay and to resume a sexuality that was in tune with their biology.”Susie Leafe, director of the conservative evangelical group Reform, told the BBC, “As a Christian minister he should pray for all people to come to know the love of Christ, rather than a fine young gentleman.”In a Dec. 1 blog, Holdsworth apologized for the outrage he had ― belatedly ― ignited, but stressed that his words had been widely misinterpreted. “I could spend the next few weeks defending that post and keep reminding people what it was originally about. However, it seems to me that isn’t likely to be fruitful,” he wrote. “The issues about the church and its capacity to welcome same-sex couples who want to be married remain important,” he continued. “I’m not interested in continuing it through a conversation about Prince George. I would urge others, those who agree with me strongly and those who disagree with me strongly to turn our attentions to the actual matter at hand.” "
1,BUSINESS,Hawaii Developer Under Fire For Segregated 'Poor Door' For Renters,Carla Herreria,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/poor-door-planned-for-hawaii-high-rise_us_5a234729e4b03c44072e06ee,The controversial entrance has been proposed across the country.,2017-12-03,"ProsPac Holdings' virtual depiction of its ""mixed-use residential project"" in the Ala Moana area of Honolulu.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a2378551400001d57b6b256.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"HONOLULU ― A real estate developer in Hawaii is under scrutiny for its plans to build a residential high-rise that has two separate entrances: one for high-income residents and another for low-income earners.ProsPac Holdings Group is developing the 41-story residential building in the Ala Moana neighborhood of Honolulu.The high-rise will include 78 affordable rental units for people earning 80 percent or less of the area median income, as required by Honolulu’s affordable housing strategy. The other 351 units will be market-priced condominiums. If things go as ProsPac plans, the units will be separated with two entrances.This separate door has become known as the “poor door,” and it drew criticism in 2014 when developers in New York, London and West Hollywood proposed similar ideas.Daniel Simonich, an assistant project manager for ProsPac, told Honolulu Civil Beat the segregated entrances are necessary because the affordable housing renters and the condo owners will be managed by different companies and will have separate housing associations. But the entrances and associations aren’t the only things segregating the groups.The condo owners will be able to enjoy the property’s pool, cabanas, dog park, fitness center and theater, according to the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. The renters will be barred from using those amenities.Simonich told Civil Beat this separation will make the costs bearable for renters.“The renters won’t have to face the burden of maintaining all those amenities because they will be separated,” Simonich told the nonprofit investigative news site.Social justice advocates don’t see it that way.“Ultimately this will be the first time we will have approved a mixed-use residential project with separate entrances,” Victor Geminiani, co-director of the Hawaii Appleseed Center for Law and Economic Justice, told Hawaii News Now.“That sends messages to all of us.”Tom Dinell, a professor of urban planning at the University of Hawaii, told Civil Beat the separate physical entrances could “stigmatize the people who qualify for affordable units.”“Affordable units and market units should be identical from the outside, including the entrance way.”New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew Cuomo did away with poor doors in 2015 after the New York Post, The New York Times and West Side Rag published stories on a luxury building that had proposed a separate entrance for its lower-income renters years earlier, inciting local outrage.“It’s such a visual separation,” state Assemblywoman Linda B. Rosenthal told The New York Times in 2014. “It gets at people when they see two separate doors. It’s no longer theoretical. It looks and smells like discrimination.”New York blocked the entrances by taking tax breaks away from affordable housing developers who separate residents by income in their projects. Buildings under construction at the time ― like the Lincoln Square tower ― were grandfathered in.Tenants in Lincoln Square’s affordable housing felt the effects of the segregated entrances, as Rosenthal had predicted.“The thing I don’t like most is we don’t have the same amenities,” Christina Figueras, a single mother of two, told the New York Post in 2016.Eric Olm, a low-income renter in the same building, told the Post his windows overlook a courtyard that is restricted to only the wealthier condo owners. “It would be nice to actually get to enjoy it,” he told the newspaper.State officials have struggled to solve Hawaii’s affordable housing crisis brought on by the island state’s high cost of living and a shortage of housing options. In May, Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell unveiled a strategy to address the crisis, offering developers a $1 year lease and help with infrastructure if they build affordable housing options.William Chen, assistant director for ProsPac in Honolulu, said their upcoming Ala Moana building actually brings together low-income and high-income earners rather than separating them.“While most developers create a market rate tower in one location and an affordable tower in another location, our solution allows both projects to exist on the same block in the heart of Honolulu’s Ala Moana neighborhood,” Chen said in a statement to Hawaii News Now.“This approach is a response to international best practices in space management and forward thinking about the kind of urban density that will work best for transit-oriented community planning.”"

Police have arrested more than 100 protesters at the site.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a22e29f150000de8685b1fb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"SANDISFIELD, Mass. ― When Karla Colon-Aponte arrived at the Otis State Forest on the morning of Oct. 25, she intended to join her fellow protesters praying beside energy giant Kinder Morgan’s Connecticut Expansion Project line, a four-mile-long natural gas pipeline that runs in a loop through the town of Sandisfield in the Berkshire hills of western Massachusetts. The Connecticut Expansion Project has been the focus of sustained activist resistance in this sleepy rural community ever since Kinder Morgan began work at the site in late April. The pipeline, which went into operation last month, links natural gas infrastructure in Massachusetts, New York and Connecticut. The portion of the project in Sandisfield cuts through Berkshire wilderness, across old-growth forest and alongside waterways, which pipeline critics say could potentially damage the natural resources in the state forest. Colon-Aponte, 22, is Taina, the indigenous people of Puerto Rico, and is part of a group known as the “water protectors,” who have traveled the country protesting energy infrastructure projects, using nonviolent resistance tactics to stop projects that they see as endangering water resources.The Massachusetts State Police, expecting trouble from the protesters, were already on site in force when Colon-Aponte arrived at the pipeline. The two sides converged on a dirt road as tensions began to rise with the early morning mist. It started as a faceoff between the protesters and the cops, but quickly escalated. As the police closed in, Colon-Aponte tried to move away from the front line. After she turned her back, an officer shoved her repeatedly, Colon-Aponte said ― at least “four or five times.” When Colon-Aponte raised her arms in submission and turned around to ask the officer to stop, she said, her hand grazed his — which provided an opening for him to arrest her for assaulting a police officer.Colon-Aponte was charged with assault and battery on a police officer, “after she allegedly pushed a trooper who was trying to clear protesters off a road they were blocking,” Massachusetts State Police Director of Media Communications David Procopio said in an email. She was one of five people arrested that day, and one of the more than 100 who have been arrested protesting at the pipeline this year. She now faces up to two and half years in jail and a fine of up to $5,000.Colon-Aponte said the police reaction to the protests, which have been peaceful and nonviolent, has been disproportionate. “We’re not bad guys,” said Colon-Aponte. “We’re just people who intend to protect Mother Earth.” But pipeline protesters think there’s a reason the reaction from state police officers has been so strong. According to records anti-pipeline protesters recently obtained through a public records request, Kinder Morgan has been reimbursing state police officers from nearby Troop B headquarters in Northampton for their many hours on site. Through October, the total reimbursement has been $957,682.15, according to Cathy Kristofferson, a member of the Massachusetts Pipeline Awareness Network.Kristofferson made the public records request in response to concerns over the potential effects the payments were having on law enforcement behavior at the site.It’s not the first time an energy giant has paid police to keep watch over its assets. In Pennsylvania, Kinder Morgan hired off-duty police officers as a “deterrent” at a pipeline in 2013. And at the height of the Dakota Access Pipeline protests last year, Energy Transfer Partners offered to defray some of North Dakota’s costs for patrolling the area. The developer transferred some $15 million into state coffers as a result of patrols on the Dakota Access line at the end of September. The cost of protecting energy infrastructure is high, no matter who takes care of it. Taxpayers would be understandably loathe to cover the costs of officers patrolling private property. But Kinder Morgan footing the bill for state police protecting this one four-mile loop of pipeline has the local activist community questioning how fair the officers on site can be to protesters when some of their income comes, albeit indirectly, from the pipeline’s operator. Abby Ferla, a farmer in the western Massachusetts town of Ashfield, is the media committee coordinator for the Sugar Shack Alliance, which represents a coalition of anti-pipeline groups across the commonwealth.“We are committed to nonviolent direct action resisting the construction of fossil fuel infrastructure,” said Ferla. The alliance’s actions have included nonviolent resistance to the Kinder Morgan pipeline in Sandisfield and appeals to the governor to address climate change more aggressively. The alliance seeks to raise awareness about the proliferation of energy projects in the region and nation, said Ferla. “The projects are not appropriate in the context of climate change,” she said. “There are safer and more sustainable options.”State Sen. Adam Hinds, a Democrat from the nearby city of Pittsfield, agreed. “We’ve been deeply disappointed that the project has gone through in the first place,” he said.Hinds also has concerns about how the state police have treated protesters at the site. His office was informed that the police are conducting an internal investigation on the Colon-Aponte arrest, Hinds said, and will have a report soon. Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren has also expressed dismay about how protests have been handled. “The concerns of local communities are being ignored,” she said in a statement provided to HuffPost. Warren said she believes the police should act with restraint and respect that there are two sides to the issue. And, she said, the company behind the pipeline should not stop citizens from exercising their rights.“Kinder Morgan should not interfere with peaceful protests,” said Warren. Concerns related to the pipeline construction extend beyond the rights of protesters. Local roads in this rural area, not used to the volume of industrial traffic, are crumbling. Kinder Morgan “needs to step up and repair damaged roads and areas that it has harmed,” said Warren.The company has indicated that it may help repair some of the damage, but stopped short of a full commitment to the work. So far, Kinder Morgan’s payments for law enforcement seem to be outpacing any money the company has spent on repairs.The documents Kristofferson obtained show that state police officers were paid overtime rates for the Kinder Morgan work, rather than the salaries they would get for covering their regular detail. Procopio told HuffPost that overtime pay varies by officer, “calculated in accordance with base salary established by rank.”Procopio said that billing the duties as overtime makes more sense given the nature of the work. Protecting the pipeline involves a greater scope of policing, he said. “Work is generally categorized as overtime when we provide a large-scale, full-service policing response,” he added.A Kinder Morgan spokesperson declined to comment on the payments, telling HuffPost that the company does not discuss police or security matters related to its pipelines. Arrests at the pipeline site have continued even after the pipeline went into operation last month. State police used a stun gun on a Sharon, Conn., man named Jacob Renner at a Nov. 1 protest.Protesters worry Kinder Morgan’s money is influencing police priorities. “I wonder if they’re able to maintain neutrality when [working] off of the Kinder Morgan payroll,” Ferla told HuffPost. “When they’re patrolling the protest, they’re on duty as police officers — it’s opaque as to when they’re paid by Kinder Morgan and when they’re not.”Priscilla Lynch, a member of the Sugar Shack Alliance and the Massachusetts chapter of Code Pink, was also arrested at the Nov. 1 protest. The police have maintained a presence at the pipeline site “24/7” since last April, Lynch said ― unusually large, in her view, for small, non-violent actions like blocking traffic. Others in the state worry that the police resources there have pulled officers off the street and away from other duties. Procopio told HuffPost that the state police has treated the pipeline detail in the same way it treats the Boston Marathon and other large events and protests. The police are expected to protect the security and safety of property and people. “In those events, the scope of the mission is not simply traffic or crowd control,” said Procopio. Kristofferson argues that if a large corporation is funding the police, they should be upfront about it. “I don’t care if they want to get side jobs,” Kristofferson said. “But they should do it in Kinder Morgan shirts and gear, not with cruisers and weaponry purchased by the commonwealth.”Now that the pipeline is in operation, the alliance is figuring out how much protest presence to maintain at the site, Ferla said. When a HuffPost reporter arrived there on Nov. 28, there were no protesters, but their presence was still felt in the signage they had left behind, with messages like “guilty.”Ferla hopes past and future protests at the site will, at the very least, start a conversation about the country’s dependence on fossil fuels. “One of our goals in resistance is to bring attention to fossil fuel projects,” said Ferla. “They’re not necessary, we don’t need them.”Eoin Higgins is on assignment for HuffPost.This article has been updated with the latest figures on reimbursement to local law enforcement."

Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., explained in a statement that the pact’s “global approach” was “simply not compatible with U.S. sovereignty.”“[O]ur decisions on immigration policies must always be made by Americans and Americans alone. We will decide how best to control our borders and who will be allowed to enter our country,” Haley said. In September of 2016, the members of the U.N. General Assembly unanimously adopted the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, a non-binding declaration committed to upholding the rights of refugees that sought to enhance international coordination on migration.At the time of its adoption, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi called the declaration “a political commitment of unprecedented force and resonance” that filled “what has been a perennial gap in the international protection system ― that of truly sharing responsibility for refugees.”On Saturday, however, the U.S. said the declaration contained “numerous provisions that are inconsistent with U.S. immigration and refugee policies and the Trump Administration’s immigration principles.” The president of the U.N. General Assembly expressed disappointment and regret at Trump’s decision, saying in a statement that no single country can “manage international migration on its own.”“The role of the United States in this process is critical as it has historically and generously welcomed people from all across the globe and remains home to the largest number of international migrants in the world,” Miroslav Lajčák said. “As such, it has the experience and expertise to help ensure that this process leads to a successful outcome.”“The United Nations should not miss this opportunity to improve the lives of millions of people throughout the world,” Lajčák added.The U.S. withdrawal came just before the Monday start of a global conference on migration in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. Under Trump, the U.S. has taken hard line on immigration. Trump has vowed to erect a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico, ramp up arrests of illegal immigrants and slow down legal immigration into the U.S. Under Trump, the U.S. has also withdrawn from many global commitments, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, the Paris climate agreement and UNESCO, the U.N.’s culture and education agency. Trump, who has championed the pursuit of a “foreign policy based on American interests,” has threatened to quit a number of other international accords, including NATO, NAFTA and the Iran nuclear deal. In light of these withdrawals and threats, many observers have wondered aloud if Trump’s “America First” policy is really an “America Alone” one. “The writing on the wall is that agreements made with the United States are not worth the paper on which they are written, because the current American president can — anytime, without due cause — call them into question without offering a realistic alternative,” U.S. correspondent Carsten von Nahmen said in an October op-ed for German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle, reacting to Trump’s stance on the Iran deal.“The president risks isolating the U.S. for the sake of his own fans — and his own ego,” the op-ed said."

The pontiff added that he’d spoken more openly about the issue in private with Myanmar’s leaders, saying he was “very, very satisfied” with his meetings with the country’s de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi ― a Nobel Peace Prize laureate who has herself been slammed for not standing up for the Rohingya ― and the country’s military chief, General Min Aung Hlaing. “It was a good conversation and the truth was non-negotiable,” Francis said of the meetings, according to Reuters. “For me, the most important thing is that the message gets through.”The U.S. has accused Myanmar’s military of “ethnic cleansing” in its alleged mass murder, rape and torture of Rohingya men, women and children living in Rakhine State. The military has committed atrocities amounting to crimes against humanity, according to Amnesty International. Pope Francis may not have addressed the Rohingya crisis directly during his time in Myanmar, but it was a different story once he got to neighboring Bangladesh ― which has seen an influx of more than 600,000 Rohingya refugees since August. With the help of translators, Francis spoke personally to 16 Rohingya refugees during an interfaith gathering in Dhaka on Friday.“In the name of everyone, of those who persecute you, of those who’ve done you wrong, above all, the world’s indifference, I ask you for forgiveness,” he said in an emotional speech. “I now appeal to your big heart, that you’re able to grant us the forgiveness we seek.”"

Schmidt noted in the story and later on Twitter, it’s not clear if McFarland believed that Russia threw the election in Trump’s favor, but a White House lawyer told the paper on Friday that she was only saying Democrats were trying to make it appear that way.The leaked emails show how Trump’s transition team worked to ease relations with Russia after former President Barack Obama attempted to punish the country for reportedly interfering in the U.S. election. These efforts would include Flynn reaching out to Russian ambassador Sergey I. Kislyak to discuss the sanctions hours after they were placed, McFarland wrote in an email, according to the Times. Flynn later resigned from his post in February following revelations that he lied about his conversations with the Russian ambassador.On Friday, Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian government, including his conversation with Kislyak about the sanctions. After news of Flynn’s guilty plea spread, Trump tweeted that he had to fire Flynn because he knew Flynn lied to Vice President Michael Pence and the FBI.On the same day Flynn pleaded guilty, the Associated Press identified McFarland as the unnamed senior official in court papers who is said to have talked to Flynn about what he would say to Russian officials during a discussion on the Obama administration’s sanctions.Trump has called for friendlier relations with Russia and continuously denies claims that his election campaign colluded with Russia during last year’s presidential election.Cobbs responded to Flynn’s guilty plea by saying it implicates no one other than Flynn himself.“The false statements involved mirror the false statements to White House officials which resulted in his resignation in February of this year. Nothing about the guilty pleas or the change implicates anyone other than Mr. Flynn,” he said in an official statement."

Robb, orders board officials around the country to consult his office on cases that involve precedents set on worker rights during the last eight years. The move effectively strips away the discretion of regional board officers to pursue cases against employers based upon Obama-era rulings and policies.Put simply, the rights that were expanded under Obama are pretty much on hold. The NLRB is the independent federal agency responsible for refereeing disputes between employers, workers and their unions. The general counsel plays a critical role at the board and functions as a quasi-prosecutor, deciding which major cases to investigate and pursue when workers claim their rights have been violated. Robb was nominated by Trump and confirmed by the Senate on Nov. 8. Wilma Liebman, a former Democratic chairwoman of the five-member board that rules on those cases, said it is standard for a new general counsel to issue a memo ordering certain cases to be sent to Washington for advice, particularly those involving recent precedents. Robb’s Democratic predecessor issued a similar memo when he came onboard. Still, Liebman said, she was surprised by the “sweeping” breadth of Robb’s memo and the speed with which it was issued after his confirmation.“The direction is crystal clear,” Liebman said. “There is an agenda: Fewer workers will have fewer rights.”Many of the precedents Robb cites in his memo involve what’s known as Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act. Those rights are at the heart of collective bargaining law, guaranteeing workers the ability to band together and engage in “mutual aid and protection.” Through their rulings and legal guidance, the board nominees under Obama took a relatively expansive view of what’s considered legally protected activity by workers. Robb’s outlook is much more likely to please employers. In his memo, he said he would be rescinding seven “guidance memos” that were crafted by his Democratic predecessors. These are memos that advise board officials on how to interpret and enforce the law. He also said it was mandatory for board officials to seek his office’s advice on matters involving “cases over the last eight years that overruled precedent and involved one or more dissents” by board members.Some of the precedents cited in his memo infuriated business groups, like the case known as Browning-Ferris. That board ruling made it easier for a big corporation to be deemed a “joint employer” alongside their subcontractors or franchisees. The change has helped workers and unions bring cases against a company like McDonald’s and not just against the individual franchisees who operate McDonald’s restaurants.Other cases were lesser known but could affect workers around the country who end up in disputes with their employers. One Obama-era case clarified employees’ ability to use their work emails to try to organize a union or talk about working conditions. Another case outlined employees’ ability to record company meetings, including anti-union speeches made by bosses.It’s common for the labor board to become more friendly to employers than workers after a Republican wins the White House. Until his nomination, Robb was a management-side attorney who represented employers and trade groups. He served as an attorney at the labor board during the early 1980s.

10,BUSINESS,Sheryl Sandberg Warns Of #MeToo Backlash Against Women,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sheryl-sandberg-sexual-harassment-backlash_us_5a22c2a5e4b03350e0b710eb,The Facebook executive is hearing people say this is why you shouldn't hire women. Actually this is why you should.,2017-12-03,"Four years ago, Sheryl Sandberg published a book encouraging women to ""lean in"" at work.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a22c35a150000de8685b1de.jpeg?cache=sKpApU19eg&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg warned Sunday morning about the potential for women to wind up on the losing end of what seems like a watershed moment in feminism. The Lean In author is cheering women on, but she writes in a lengthy Facebook post, “I have already heard the rumblings of a backlash.”Over the last two months, every day has seemed to bring new allegations of sexual misconduct against powerful men, who are facing real consequences for their actions. And people are already saying, “‘This is why you shouldn’t hire women,’” Sandberg writes.“Actually, this is why you should,” she continues. Hiring, mentoring and promoting women is the only long-term solution to sexual harassment, which is all about power, according to Sandberg. In her post, she also outlines some basic guidelines that companies should follow if they’re serious about preventing harassment at work.The solution certainly isn’t the so-called Pence rule ― the vice president reportedly will not dine alone with another woman unless his wife is present ― as some have suggested. Instead, Sandberg writes, men should strive to treat colleagues and employees equally. If you won’t dine or drink alone with a woman, then you shouldn’t do it with a man either.“Doing right by women in the workplace does not just mean treating them with respect. It also means not isolating or ignoring them,” Sandberg writes. “And it means making access equal. Whether that means you take all your direct reports out to dinner or none of them, the key is to give men and women equal opportunities to succeed.”Lean In, which was almost an instant manifesto for corporate feminism when it came out in 2013, is looking a little rusty these days. In the book, Sandberg urged women to be more ambitious in the workplace. The recent flood of sexual harassment and assault allegations make it clear that ambition and leaning in aren’t enough.Women who are sexually harassed are more likely to quit their jobs and leave their industries, not gun for that next promotion, research has shown.In her post, Sandberg doesn’t address this problem head-on, although she does point out that Lean In brought up the issue of men not giving women opportunities because of fear they might be accused of harassment.“I wrote in Lean In that 64 percent of managers are afraid to be alone with a woman colleague, in part because of fears of being accused of sexual harassment,” she writes. “The problem with this is that mentoring almost always occurs in one-on-one settings. One of the most gratifying responses I got from Lean In was when senior men acknowledged that they had been giving fewer opportunities to women, often without really thinking about it. I got call after call where CEOs and some of the most senior men in many industries told me, ‘I never really thought about it before ― but you are right that I take men on the trip and to the dinner rather than women and that is unfair.’”Perhaps then it is men who need to do some leaning in. Instead of succumbing to fear over sexual politics, they should be taking the leap and helping women advance at work. That’s the key to ultimately solving the problem of men abusing power, Sandberg writes.“Ultimately, the thing that will bring the most to change our culture is the one I’ve been writing and talking about for a long time: having more women with more power,” she writes.Along her way up, Sandberg says she had her share of experiences with more powerful men who tried to take advantage ― a hand on the leg, career advice that had to be given late at night and alone.But now Sandberg is one of the most powerful female executives in the world ― at the top of a multibillion-dollar company, with 2 billion users, which likely even played a role in deciding the U.S. presidential election. Harassment happens to her very rarely now, she writes. “Only ever with men who in that moment, feel that they have more power than I do.”"

That evening, she went on a second date with a woman she’d met online. The woman she was last seen with, 23-year-old Bailey Boswell, admitted she was with Loofe in the hours before she was reported missing, police said.Boswell, of Wilber, Nebraska, was arrested Thursday in Taney County, Missouri, on an unrelated charge. Her roommate, 51-year-old Aubrey Trail, was also picked up in Missouri on a charge unrelated to Loofe’s disappearance.“The Lincoln Police Department has flown down there to speak with them,” Loofe’s mother, Susie Loofe, told HuffPost. “We’re hoping to get answers and find her.”Despite being named “persons of interest” by authorities in Nebraska, investigators have not found enough evidence to file charges against Boswell or Trail in Loofe’s disappearance.According to Lincoln Police Chief Jeff Bliemeister, Boswell is jailed on an outstanding misdemeanor warrant for missing a court date relating to a drug case. Trail, who has a lengthy criminal record, was wanted for possession of a firearm by a prohibited person. Both are being held without bond on a federal hold at the Taney County Jail in Missouri.Cops want to talk to Boswell and Trail because they “were with Sydney in a very close proximity to the last place that we know where she was,” Bliemeister said at a Thursday news conference at the Hall of Justice in Lincoln.Loofe’s mother told HuffPost that detectives plan to question the pair sometime Friday.“The Lincoln Police Department has flown down there to speak with them,” she said. “They are going to do those interviews today.”There was no word Friday afternoon as to whether Boswell or Trail are cooperating with police. Susie Loofe said the pair are not known to the family.Prior to their arrests, Boswell and Trail posted several bizarre videos online in which they addressed reports about their possible involvement in Loofe’s disappearance.“I’ve never killed anyone in my life and I’ve never hurt a female in my life, so take that for whatever the hell that’s worth,” Trail says in one of the videos. “The officers in this investigation have the people of Wilbur scared to death.”He adds, ”[I’m] not saying I’m a nice guy. I’m a crook. I’m a thief. Have been all my life. OK? But I’m not what you’re trying to make me out to be.”In the same video, Boswell insists she had nothing to do with Loofe’s disappearance. She acknowledges she’d gone on a couple of Tinder dates with Loofe, during which she claims they drove around and smoked marijuana, but says she last saw her on Nov. 15 ― the night of their second date.“I went to take her home, and she asked me to drop her off at a friend’s house,” Boswell says. “And I did so. I gave her my number ... I haven’t heard from her since.”Trail accuses the Lincoln Police Department of publicly smearing them and chasing them around “like dogs.” He denies rumors that the pair sold Loofe to human traffickers.“It’s ridiculous,” he says. “I am not a pedophile. I like adults. Females ― 20s, 30s ― so sue me. I’m an old, horny guy. So what?”The first video ends with Boswell flipping off the camera.“I wish the family the best, I mean no disrespect to anyone and as far as the police department, fuck you,” Trail says.Bliemeister said detectives are looking into Boswell’s and Trail’s claims. Earlier this week, they drained a pond and searched an area in Wilber, where Loofe’s cellphone last pinged a tower. Wilber is about 40 miles southwest of Lincoln. The searches were reportedly conducted not far from an apartment Trail rented.The police chief said both searches failed to produce evidence in the case. The FBI is now assisting Lincoln police.“We are applying all of our resources to help bring Sydney home,” said Randy Thysse, special agent in charge of the FBI field office in Omaha. “We are doing our best as a law enforcement team to pursue any and all leads related to this investigation.”Syndey’s father, George, also spoke at Thursday’s news conference.“Someone knows something,” he said. “Please do the right thing.”Loofe grew up in Neligh, a small city in Antelope County. She graduated from Neligh-Oakdale High School, where her father is the principal and her mother is a special education teacher.The middle of three children, Loofe is described by her mother as a responsible young adult. Loofe loves spending time with family, adores her kitty, Nimzy, and enjoys fishing. She has worked at Menards in Lincoln for several years. The home improvement store is where Loofe landed when she decided college wasn’t for her, Susie Loofe said.In fact, it was when Loofe failed to show up to Menards for work on Nov. 16 that people began to suspect something was wrong. It was out of character for Loofe to miss work, especially without calling.The family has since posted thousands of flyers throughout the community and is asking people to join the Finding Sydney Loofe Facebook page. They’re also seeking additional volunteers to put up posters. Anyone interested in participating can email them at findingsydneyloofe@gmail.com.Asked by a reporter Thursday if investigators still have hope that they’ll find Loofe alive, Bliemeister said, “Yes. Absolutely.”“That’s what we’re hoping too,” Susie Loofe told HuffPost on Friday.Sydney Loofe is described as a white female, 5 feet, 7 inches, and 130 pounds. She has blond hair and blue eyes. She has a yin-yang tattoo on one of her forearms, the word “Believe” with a cross on the inside of her left wrist and the phrase “Everything will be wonderful someday” on her right bicep. She was last seen wearing a white Columbia-brand jacket and a cream-colored shirt.Thysse said the FBI has set up a tip line and is asking anyone with information to call (402) 493-8688 and selection Option 1.Tips?

13,POLITICS,Arctic Drilling Would (At Best) Recoup 0.075 Percent Of The Debt From GOP Tax Plan,Chris D'Angelo,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/arctic-refuge-drilling-gop-tax-plan_us_5a22b21de4b03350e0b70eed,“The Arctic Refuge isn’t a bank — drilling there won’t pay for the tax cuts the Senate just passed.”,2017-12-02,"Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) oversees a Senate committee hearing, June 20, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a22f48e1500000e8785b21e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration and Republican lawmakers have touted the economic benefits, an estimated $1.1 billion in federal revenues by 2027, that they say would come from opening Alaska’s fragile Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas development. The fossil fuel-friendly provision, however, is tucked away in a GOP tax reform bill that’s expected to raise the national deficit by $1.47 trillion — that’s trillion with a T — over that same 10-year period. In other words, lease sales and royalties from drilling in the refuge, a pristine landscape considered one of Alaska’s crown jewels, would, at best, recoup roughly 0.075 percent of the debt expected to be generated by the tax bill.It’s a point that’s left many Democrats and environmentalists fuming. “Opening the Arctic to drilling as part of this tax plan is simply shameful,” David Yarnold, president and CEO of the National Audubon Society, said in a statement Saturday. “The Arctic Refuge isn’t a bank — drilling there won’t pay for the tax cuts the Senate just passed.”The legislation, introduced last month by Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), would require Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to approve at least two lease sales for drilling — each consisting of no fewer than 400,000 acres — in the refuge’s 1.5 million-acre coastal plain, also known as the 1002 Area.The bill allows for 2,000 acres of the coastal plain to be developed with wells and support facilities.Described by some as “America’s Serengeti,” the refuge covers more than 19 million acres in northeastern Alaska and is home to polar bears, caribou, moose and hundreds of species of migratory birds.Scientists, environmentalists, a bipartisan group of former Interior Department officials and even a group of 12 Republican lawmakers have warned that energy production could spoil the landscape and harm the species that call it home.After decades of unsuccessful attempts to open up this area to energy development, Republicans appear on the verge of victory. But the process by which they got here has been fraught with controversy.Murkowski introduced the bill under special budget “reconciliation” rules, allowing it to avoid a filibuster and be passed by a simple 51-vote majority. Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) introduced an amendment late Friday to remove the arctic drilling provision from the tax bill, but it was ultimately voted down by Republicans.The Senate passed its wildly unpopular tax bill early Saturday morning by a 51-49 vote. Murkowski called it a “critical milestone” in Alaska’s effort to secure its economic future.“Opening the 1002 Area and tax reform both stand on their own, but combining them into the same bill, and then successfully passing that bill, makes this a great day to be an Alaskan,” she said in a statement.Murkowski and other Alaska officials have pushed back on accusations that they are putting short-term economic gain over environmental protection. And they say it’s time for Congress to fulfill a promise it made to Alaska back in 1980 with its passage of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, which set aside the coastal plain for potential future oil and gas development. Putting aside legitimate environmental concerns, the economic incentive to open the refuge is not clear-cut, with revenue estimates widely disputed. The Trump administration, whose 2018 fiscal year budget calls for allowing oil and gas production in the coastal plain, pegs the figure at $1.8 billion over 10 years. But Bloomberg reported in October that previous lease sales in the Arctic “suggest the U.S. is likely to collect less than a fifth of that billion-dollar goal over the next decade — about $145.5 million — from auctioning off territory in the sprawling northeast Alaska refuge.”An analysis by the left-leaning Center for American Progress found that by drilling in the refuge, the U.S. government would likely only collect $37.5 million over 10 years. David Murphy, an assistant professor at St. Lawrence University, concluded in a recent report that “drilling there would have little appreciable effect on increasing U.S. energy security,” and that “current presidential and congressional budget projections are unrealistic, and thus that it would be fiscally irresponsible to pursue this path on a budget justification.”At a committee hearing last month to consider Murkowski’s proposal, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) noted the absurdity of pushing for $1 billion in additional fossil fuel development amid the devastating effects of human-caused climate change.“You’re talking about raising a billion dollars here,” Sanders told Murkowski. “I’m talking about the United States government spending hundreds of billions of dollars repairing damage, which, to a significant degree, not totally, had to do with climate change. And the scientists tell us the worst is yet to come.”With the House having already passed its tax bill, the two chambers are now expected to schedule a conference committee to hash out final details before the legislation can become law. And environmental groups are calling on House lawmakers to oppose the Arctic drilling provision. Jamie Rappaport Clark, president and CEO of Defenders of Wildlife, said in a statement that “all eyes are on the House now to save the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.”“Sen. Murkowski’s big sellout to the oil industry must be stopped,” she said. “An international treasure and America’s conservation legacy are at stake.”"

If anyone is guilty of sexual harassment or sexual assault, they should not hold elected office. Congressman Kihuen should resign,” DCCC Chairman Rep. Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) said in a statement. The victim, identified as Samantha, said that Kihuen repeatedly harassed her and made unwanted sexual advancements toward her, touching her thigh twice without her consent, during his 2016 congressional campaign, according to a BuzzFeed report published Friday.In one incident, Samantha told BuzzFeed she rejected Kihuen when he suggested they get a room together in a hotel they were visiting for a meeting with Rep. Tony Cardenas (D-Calif.). At another time, she said, when he began touching her thigh, Kihuen asked if she’d ever cheat on her boyfriend.The harassment made Samantha, who was 25 at the time, so uncomfortable, she said, that she quit as his campaign finance director five months after she started.After Samantha told a DCCC staffer the reason she was quitting, the information was eventually passed to Kihuen’s campaign manager, Dave Chase, who confronted Kihuen. During that conversation, Kihuen reportedly denied he had misbehaved.Sen. Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) condemned her colleague’s behavior in a statement Friday. Masto said she supported a “full, fair and expedient” investigation into Kihuen and other members of Congress who are facing similar accusations of harassment and abuse, but she did not call for Kihuen to resign.“In the days and weeks ahead, I will work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to demand meaningful reform of the Ethics process in Congress,” Masto said.In a statement shared just after midnight on Saturday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said that no one in Congress “should face sexual harassment in order to work in an office or in a campaign” and called for Kihuen’s resignation.“The young woman’s documented account is convincing, and I commend her for the courage it took to come forward,” Pelosi said.Kihuen apologized for making Samantha uncomfortable but said it “is not indicative of who I am” in a statement to BuzzFeed:“The staff member in question was a valued member of my team. I sincerely apologize for anything that I may have said or done that made her feel uncomfortable. I take this matter seriously as it is not indicative of who I am. I was raised in a strong family that taught me to treat women with the utmost dignity and respect. I have spent my fifteen years in public service fighting for women’s equality, and I will continue to do so.” This story has been updated to include House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi’s statement."

Luis Gutiérrez tried to tilt the contest.,2017-12-02,Rep. Luis Gutiérrez (D-Ill.) announced Tuesday that he would retire from Congress at the end of his current term.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a22c2731900008f110341ce.jpeg?cache=hxaMPmM9WA&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Once the dust settled after Democratic Rep. Luis Gutiérrez’s surprise announcement Tuesday that he would retire from Illinois’ 4th Congressional District at the end of his term, something even more unexpected happened.The frequently disappointed activists who occupy the left wing of the Democratic Party publicly rejoiced at their good fortune.Two prominent progressives, Cook County Commissioner Jesús “Chuy” Garcia and Chicago Alderman Carlos Ramirez-Rosa immediately announced their intention to run for the seat that Gutiérrez has held since 1993. (The district, where Hillary Clinton defeated Donald Trump by 68 percentage points in 2016, is gerrymandered to bring together heavily Latino swathes of northwestern and southwestern Chicago with nearby suburbs.)For hardline progressive voters, a potential showdown in the March 20, 2018, primary between Garcia and Ramirez-Rosa, a dues-paying member of the Democratic Socialists of America, amounts to an embarrassment of riches. They see it as a plum opportunity to capitalize on the leftward drift of the Democratic Party since last year’s presidential run by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).“There is no doubt that progressive politics are the way of the future for the Democratic Party and there is a real opportunity to bring someone who represents that into Congress,” said Nomiki Konst, a former Sanders convention delegate who serves on the Democratic National Committee’s Unity and Reform Commission.“It’s a Democratic district. Why not go for somebody as progressive as possible and have a real fighter in Congress?” Konst added.What’s more, both Garcia and Ramirez-Rosa would be more reliably left-wing and anti-establishment than Gutiérrez has been, according to several activists.Unlike Gutiérrez, who backed the 2015 re-election bid of Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, himself a centrist Democrat, Garcia and Ramirez-Rosa are both ardent Emanuel opponents. The two-term mayor has attracted the ire of Chicago progressives for, among other things, closing public schools and mental health clinics and enabling the upscale development of historically diverse, working-class neighborhoods.Garcia, 61, challenged Emanuel in the 2015 mayor’s race, forcing the first mayoral runoff in Chicago history. Ramirez-Rosa, 28, has been one of Emanuel’s most vocal critics on the city council since his own election in 2015.“We saw the work that [Gutiérrez] did for Rahm Emanuel in 2015 after Emanuel had so specifically targeted black and brown communities for displacement, for gentrification,” said Emma Tai, executive director of United Working Families, a progressive grassroots organization that has not yet endorsed anybody in the race. “There’s no question that either Carlos Ramirez-Rosa or Chuy Garcia would be real champions for working people in D.C.”“Luis is friends with [Emanuel] and never really stood up to him,” said Lucie Macías, a Ramirez-Rosa supporter and fellow member of the Chicago chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America, which has not yet formally endorsed anybody in the race. “That immediately makes me feel that Luis is not a true progressive.”Sen. Sanders is another point of commonality for Garcia and Ramirez-Rosa: Both supported him in the 2016 presidential primary. Gutiérrez, on the other hand, was an ardent Clinton supporter who questioned whether Sanders even “likes immigrants” in June 2015.Although Sanders, like Ramirez-Rosa, identifies as a democratic socialist, Garcia’s ties to him run a shade deeper than those of the young alderman. Sanders endorsed Garcia’s run against Emanuel in April 2015. Garcia returned the favor by backing the senator’s presidential bid that November at a time when few other prominent Democrats were doing so.This week Sanders wasted no time putting his considerable weight behind Garcia’s congressional run, making his support public on Wednesday.Garcia “is ready and willing to stand up and fight for the working families of Chicago and our nation and take on the powerful special interests who have far too much economic and political power,” Sanders said in a statement. “He is also an experienced legislator who has risen up the ladder of Chicago’s brawling politics. That makes him well groomed for jumping into the House’s rough and tumble political battles.”Despite the general progressive joy over the primary to come, there are suspicions that Gutiérrez, who endorsed Garcia even as he announced his own retirement, had planned it all in a way that limited the competitiveness of next year’s race. Gutiérrez’s announcement left potential candidates with just six days to collect the petition signatures needed to secure a place on the primary ballot in March. Candidates must submit 864 signatures from registered Democrats living in the district by Monday, but since campaigns frequently challenge the validity of their opponents’ signatures, they’re all canvassing feverishly to collect thousands of names.“If I were the retiring congressman, it’s not how I would have handled it,” Ramirez-Rosa told HuffPost. “As the Democratic Party, we’ve learned that we benefit when we have open and contested primaries.”Garcia’s decision to run could also conveniently remove Emanuel’s greatest rival in a potential 2019 race for his third term as mayor, Chicago politics watchers have been keen to note.“Anyone who thinks more than 5 seconds about how this whole deal went down can’t help but realize things smell a little fishy,” said Micah Uetricht, a Chicago-based associate editor of the socialist magazine Jacobin.Konst, the former Sanders convention delegate, emphasized that she had no evidence that Gutiérrez backed Garcia as a favor to Emanuel. Still, she wondered aloud, “How great would it be if Chuy were the mayor and Ramirez-Rosa were the congressman?”Garcia admitted to HuffPost that Gutiérrez had both told him that he was considering retiring at the end of last week and said that he would not retire unless Garcia was willing to run. Garcia nonetheless denied that Gutiérrez’s abrupt announcement and then endorsement of him had in any way reduced the competitiveness and openness of the primary race.“With respect to the process, there is no quid pro quo. There are no pre-conditions for it,” Garcia said. “It’s not nepotism because it is not a relative handing something down to another relative.”Uetricht, a friend of Ramirez-Rosa’s and fellow member of the Democratic Socialists of America, warned that the appearance of favoritism could still poison relations between the party and its progressive base.“It seems in some ways like exactly the kind of backroom deal that people reacted so strongly against with the Hillary Clinton campaign,” Uetricht said, referring to evidence that Clinton had effectively co-opted the Democratic National Committee for her own purposes during the 2016 presidential primary. “It just further enrages the left into thinking that this party does not represent them.”In contrast with other primary battles that might pit a clearly moderate Democrat against a progressive rival, the national policy positions of Ramirez-Rosa and Garcia are almost identical. They both support single-payer health care, free public college tuition and a $15 federal minimum wage, and they both promise to take up Gutiérrez’s mantle as a champion of immigrant rights and comprehensive immigration reform.Both Ramirez-Rosa and Garcia can also claim to authentically represent the Mexican and Puerto Rican communities of the congressional district. Garcia, who immigrated to Chicago from a village in the Mexican state of Durango when he was 10 years old, is married to a Puerto Rican woman. Ramirez-Rosa, who was born in Chicago, is the son of a Mexican-American mother and a Puerto Rican father.Other candidates vying to get on the primary ballot include Chicago Alderman Proco “Joe” Moreno and Chicago police Lt. Richard Gonzalez, who has already filed enough petitions to qualify. But local observers suggest the race for Illinois’ 4th District will likely come down to a battle between Garcia and Ramirez-Rosa.Garcia, a mustachioed grandfather of six, speaks in a calm, deliberative voice as he explains why he would make a good congressman. His pitch is heavy on experience, about how he has worked his way up through Chicago politics since 1984. “I have a 40-year history of being an organizer, an advocate, a community builder in Chicagoland communities,” Garcia said. “I am an immigrant and have lived the immigrant experience in these communities in the Chicagoland region that comprise the 4th District.”Ramirez-Rosa, who sports a hip undercut coiffeur and stylish black-rim glasses, was Chicago’s first openly gay Latino alderman ― and would likely be the first openly gay Latino man to serve in Congress as well. During his briefer time in public life ― as an alderman, a Democratic Socialists of America activist, an immigrant rights organizer and an onetime staffer to Rep. Gutiérrez ― Ramirez-Rosa said he has distinguished himself by his willingness to take on more established Democrats.“What I bring that’s different is the ability to take on the establishment and win, the ability to buck the status quo and show people that we can fight in ways that others did not think possible,” said Ramirez-Rosa, a certain manic energy audible in his remarks.Indeed, in November, Ramirez-Rosa was the sole Chicago alderman to vote against Emanuel’s plan to build a $95 million police training academy on the West Side of Chicago, calling instead for greater police accountability and investment in other resources for local residents.Shortly after President Trump’s election in November 2016, Ramirez-Rosa also publicly demonstrated for the city to do more to protect undocumented immigrants, calling on the mayor to provide those facing deportation with free or subsidized legal representation. The following month, Emanuel announced the allocation of $1 million for the legal defense of the city’s undocumented immigrants.Ramirez-Rosa’s youth and combative profile has galvanized more grassroots support, according to Macías who, together with dozens of her fellow democratic socialists, has swarmed Chicago’s El stops and street corners every night this week to collect signatures for him.Ramirez-Rosa “has mobilized a lot of people in a way that I don’t think Chuy has,” Macías said. “Yes, they are both progressive candidates, but one of them has momentum and is getting people super excited about the campaign.”Neither Garcia nor Ramirez-Rosa had a bad word to say about the other.One issue that could prove contentious, however, is the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which seeks to pressure Israel to end its occupation of the Palestinian territories. Daniel Biss, an Illinois state senator seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination next year, dropped Ramirez-Rosa as his running mate in September after the alderman refused to renounce BDS.The 4th District does not have a large Jewish community. But more hawkish Democratic donors and activists at the state and national levels could mobilize against Ramirez-Rosa for failing to toe the line against the protest movement.Asked about his current stance on BDS, Ramirez-Rosa declined to either embrace or condemn it, implying instead that he favored leveraging U.S. aid to change Israeli government behavior.“As it relates to Israel and Palestine, I have been consistent about the need to have a conversation about how the U.S. government leverages the money that it has to bring about a two-state solution,” he said.At the same time, Ramirez-Rosa said he would reject legislation that in any way criminalizes participation in the BDS movement.“We have to protect the First Amendment,” he said. “Any movement or any attempt to try and take away the rights of those fighting for social and economic justice and peace in Palestine is something that I would oppose.”For Garcia’s part, when asked about any policy differences with Ramirez-Rosa, the Cook County commissioner volunteered that he staunchly opposes BDS. He prefaced his remarks by saying he wasn’t certain about Ramirez-Rosa’s position.An area where “we may have a little nuance is on the question of Israel and BDS,” Garcia said. “I have not endorsed the BDS movement. I believe in a two-state solution and the BDS movement does not address what solution there ought to be to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.”"

Colorado Civil Rights Commission, I addressed the free speech issue posed in",2017-12-02,"Inspirational quotes and Bible verses are displayed in Masterpiece Cakeshop in Lakewood, Colorado. September 21, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a22df96140000bd53b6b121.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In my first piece on Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, I addressed the free speech issue posed in the case, which will be heard by the Supreme Court next week.In this piece, I will address the freedom of religion issue.The Masterpiece Cakeshop case involves the constitutionality, as applied to a specific factual situation, of the Colorado Antidiscrimination Act, which makes it unlawful for any business in Colorado to deny to any person, because of race, creed, color, sex, sexual orientation, or national origin, the full and equal enjoyment of the business’ goods, services, or facilities.Jack Phillips, the owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop in Lakewood, Colorado, refused to sell a wedding cake to Charlie Craig and David Mullins, a same-sex couple. Phillips maintains that it would violate his religious faith for him to participate in this manner in a same-sex wedding. He therefore insists that he has a constitutional right to discriminate against Craig and Mullins and that for the state to forbid him to do so would violate his right to the free exercise of religion, which is guaranteed by the First Amendment.What are we to make of this claim?The First Amendment prohibits government to make any law “prohibiting the free exercise” of religion. Clearly, this calls into question any law that expressly restricts the “free exercise” of any specific religion. For example, a law that forbids Jews to vote or forbids Muslims from attending public schools would unquestionably violate the Free Exercise Clause.A more difficult question, as in the free speech context, is how to deal with laws that do not expressly restrict the religious freedom of members of any particular religion, but have only an incidental effect on the actions of members of certain religions.The Supreme Court first addressed this issue in 1879 when it held that a law forbidding polygamy did not violate the First Amendment rights of Mormons. The Court explained that although the Free Exercise Clause forbids the government to prohibit religious beliefs, it did not deny government the authority “to reach actions” that are “in violation of social duties” or that are “subversive of good order.” Because the challenged law was not directed specifically against religion, it could constitutionally be applied to Mormons even though it had an incidental effect on the freedom of Mormons to act in accord with their religious beliefs.Under such an approach, Jack Phillips would clearly lose. Just as their religious beliefs gave Mormons no First Amendment right to violate general laws against polygamy, it would give Phillips no First Amendment right to violate general laws against discrimination.But the law became more complex some eighty-five years later when the Supreme Court decided Sherbert v. Verner in 1963. Mrs. Sherbert, a Seventh-Day Adventist, was fired by her employer because she would not work on Saturday, which was her church’s Sabbath. She was unable to find other employment in her town that would allow her to observe her Sabbath, so she applied for unemployment compensation, which was denied because of her refusal to accept a job that required her to work on Saturdays.The Supreme Court held that the state’s denial of unemployment compensation to Mrs. Sherbert in these circumstances imposed an undue burden on her right to the free exercise of religion. This was so, the Court explained, because it was apparent in the circumstances that Mrs. Sherbert was being denied this benefit because of her desire to act in accord with her religious faith, and because the state had no “compelling interest” to justify treating her in this manner.Under this approach, Jack Phillips might well have a First Amendment right not to provide a wedding cake for a same-sex couple. In 1972-73, I was a law clerk to Justice William J. Brennan, Jr., who had written the Supreme Court’s opinion in the Sherbert case. I asked Brennan why, in the liberal heyday of the Warren Court, the justices had reached this result.He explained that the issue was not only one of religious freedom, but of religious equality. As a general rule, governments will not enact laws that interfere with the religiously-motivated actions of members of mainstream religions, and if they do adopt such laws they will invariably exempt members of mainstream religions to opt out of the laws. A simple example of this was the exception during Prohibition for the sacramental use of wine.Thus, Brennan explained to me that when this situation arises it is almost invariably because the majority is either indifferent or hostile to the interests of religious minorities. In such circumstances, he added, it is especially important for the courts to ensure equal treatment in the realm of religious belief. I was convinced.But the story doesn’t end there. Some thirty years later, in Employment Division v. Smith, which was decided in 1990, the Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of a state law that denied unemployment compensation to individuals who had been fired because they had violated the law, including for their use of peyote. Smith was a member of the Native American Church, which has as a part of its religious ritual the use of peyote (in much the same way that other religious use wine). He claimed that, under the principle established in Sherbert, the government could not constitutionally deny him unemployment compensation.In an opinion authored by Justice Antonin Scalia, the Court, in a five-to-four decision, effectively overruled Sherbert and held that the Free Exercise Clause did not protect Smith’s right to use peyote. Justice Scalia held in no uncertain terms that “an individual’s religious beliefs” do not “excuse him from compliance with an otherwise valid law prohibiting conduct that the State is free to regulate.”The “government’s ability to enforce generally applicable prohibitions of socially harmful conduct,” he explained, “cannot depend on measuring the effects of a governmental action on a religious object.” Indeed, “to make an individual’s obligation to obey such a law contingent upon the law’s coincidence with his religious beliefs,” and thus permitting him in effect “to become a law unto himself,” contradicts “both constitution tradition and common sense.”Thus, although a strong case can be made for the ruling in Sherbert v. Verner, it is emphatically no longer the law, and under the precedent of Smith Jack Phillips has no credible claim under the Free Exercise Clause.It will be interesting to see whether the current array of conservative Justices will apply the reasoning of Smith in a consistent and principled manner not only to a member of the Native American Church, but also to a Christian who claims that his faith gives him a constitutional right to violate laws forbidding discrimination against same-sex persons when he sells wedding cakes."

Cebulski had even created an elaborate false backstory for Yoshida, drawing criticism from people of Asian descent who labeled his actions as “yellowface.” Cebulski released a statement saying he had been “young and naive” at the time and the issue was “all old news that has been dealt with.” But both Luna and Nguyen feel that damage has been done. “It’s equal parts shocking, disappointing and discouraging,” Luna told HuffPost. “It’s not necessarily strange to use a pseudonym, but to use an Asian pen name when someone’s not of Asian descent is wild to me, especially when so many actual Asians are constantly denied access to these kinds of opportunities.”Luna explained that Cebulski’s actions sting in part because of Marvel’s long history of problematic representation of Asians in its comics. Its “Iron Fist” series has been criticized for perpetuating a white savior narrative. “Daredevil” received backlash for its ninjas who were given little more than two-dimensional, stereotypical stories. And “Doctor Strange’s” Tibetan “The Ancient One” is thought to be another incarnation of the “old Asian sage” stereotype. The list goes on, as Gizmodo points out. All these titles made it on screen and little was done to remedy the issues in the plots. In fact, actress Tilda Swinton even ended up whitewashing the part of “The Ancient One.” What’s more, the company once blamed diversity for a dip in sales following a 2014 push for inclusion ― a claim that the Independent proved untrue as diverse stories including “Ms. Marvel” and “Black Panther” were both top selling comics. Luna wonders that with such an attitude towards inclusion at Marvel, perhaps Cebulski’s Yoshida has harmed writers of Asian descent.“It makes you wonder just how many Asian comic book writers were turned away because an “Akira Yoshida” was already filling the “Asian quota.”With Cebulski moving forward as editor-in-chief, Luna says that it appears Marvel hasn’t learned its lesson. He believes that the company’s insistence that inclusivity and racial sensitivity are important to them is a “hollow” statement. “This ‘Akira Yoshida’ story sends yet another message of Asian culture being desired, but not actual Asian people,” he said. For Nguyen, who goes by “Trungles” professionally, Cebulski’s actions have greater implications that extend beyond the confines of comics. Cebulski’s choice to pose behind an Asian name exemplifies a privilege that Asian immigrant families simply are not afforded. “Asian-Americans, have had to adapt more English sounding names in great part to help ensure economic survivability for ourselves and our families. It’s a necessity for the sake of our access to professional advancement, to jobs,” Nguyen explained. “In Cebulski’s case, he’s a white man who’s taken on a Japanese pen name, [circumventing] internal rules of employment, while also lending a veneer of credence to the purported ‘Japaneseness’ of his writing.”Nguyen called the act of adjusting a name for profit or just to assume an aesthetic, rather than for survival, “troubling.”Moreover, Cebulski’s remark that the situation had been “dealt with” made it seem as though the editor-in-chief was “one-and-done” when it comes to learning from the matter, Nguyen said. In light of the backlash that ensued following another incident in literature in which it was revealed that a poem by “Yi-Fen Chou,” in the 2015 edition of Best American Poetry, was actually penned by Michael Derrick Hudson of Fort Wayne, Indiana, Luna feels that Cebulski should step down.But only time will tell if Marvel is willing to truly make moves towards real and responsible diversity.UPDATE: Dec. 20 ― In a statement to The Atlantic on Dec. 17, Cebulski said he was “truly sorry for the pain, anger, and disappointment I caused over my poor choice of pseudonym.” He referred to the decision to use the Yoshida name as a “misstep” and mentioned that since the news broke, he’s spoken with “talent close to this issue” and has had discussions around being “mindful of the voices behind them.”“My passion has always been about bringing the best talent from across the world to work on the best stories in the world, and I’m hopeful that fans and creators alike will join us in that continued mission,” he wrote. His remarks, however, failed to win over critics who pointed out that he only apologized for the use of the pseudonym itself but did not acknowledge the consequences of assuming a Japanese-inspired identity."

Cipolla’s presence alongside Wintrich is good evidence there is little that’s “lite” about Wintrich’s “alt.”A onetime member of the Proud Boys, a thuggish crew of extremists that attracts racists and fascists, Cipolla has been arrested multiple times, once for punching a 19-year-old woman.And when a woman in the audience at UConn snatched Wintrich’s notes off his lectern, prompting Wintrich to chase after her and grab her “in a violent manner,” according to a police report, Cipolla flung himself into the scuffle.It was over quickly.

Cipolla got a police escort outside.This may seem like a minor episode in the grand scheme of intolerance ― our Republican president is, after all, regularly tweeting the same racist propaganda as white supremacists these days. But we should note that since fans of Richard Spencer sieg-heiled in public last year, members of the “alt-lite” have taken great pains to distance themselves ― at least in the public eye ― from their overtly racist fellow travelers in the “alt-right” white supremacist movement. Their goal is to scuttle closer to mainstream conservatism by pushing off from harder-edged extremists such as Spencer, which Wintrich made clear in the transcript of his speech:Why does the media and the left try and get us to talk about him? ... Because they don’t want to talk about the real racism of society, the appalling racism that we see everywhere and that is being solely peddled by the progressive left. Think of the people who objected to the [It’s OK to be white] slogan. They weren’t pariahs like Spencer, they were well-paid university administrators, columnists in national newspapers, officials in local government. The Establishment. That’s the racism we should be talking about.Imagine this shameless contortion of logic being dropped on a bunch of impressionable young conservatives. The “It’s OK to be White” meme was cooked up in the neo-Nazi bowels of 4chan as a way to troll liberals into protesting whiteness and generating far-right propaganda. White supremacists embraced it. So did Wintrich. His entire speech was inspired by the meme and designed to normalize it.And yet he wanted to use Spencer as a foil. It has become increasingly obvious to anyone paying attention ― such as the protesters in the UConn audience chanting “Go home, Nazis!” ― that birds of a feather tend to alight on the same fasces and that the alt-light continues to provide not only a cover for the extremists of the far-right but also a conduit for their political energy into the mainstream.Cipolla was a heaving, blundering example of it.In June, this racist roustabout, while working in conjunction with Loomer, Posobiec and other alt-lite activists, was arrested for rushing the stage during a performance of Shakespeare’s “Julius Caesar” in Central Park while screaming, “Goebbels would be proud!”A week later, Wintrich appeared at a “Rally Against Political Violence” in front of the White House that began with a Trump supporter shouting, “It’s time to put George Soros in the gas chamber!” One of the groups in charge of security for the event was the 211 Bootboys, a neo-Nazi skinhead crew. Joining Wintrich at the event were Loomer, Posobiec, Cernovich and members of the Proud Boys, one of whom delivered a hateful speech about the media that had an audience member bellowing about “violent communist scum!”It’s unclear if Cipolla made that event, but he did show up in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Aug. 12 for a frenzy of white supremacist violence in the streets that left a counter-protester dead. These were the sort of conservatives the UConn College Republicans chose to host on campus.“We brought Mr. Wintrich to campus to have a conversation about identity politics, and we understand that this is a controversial issue,” the group said in a statement Thursday. “However, we firmly believe in our Constitutional right to invite him to speak on campus and present his point of view.”After Wintrich was released by the police in Connecticut on Tuesday night, having posed in his tuxedo for a smirking mug shot, Cipolla posted a Facebook live video of his associate, asking him what it had been like in the clink.“It’s basically another Shoah,” Cipolla joked. “This is basically the equivalent of the Holocaust, right?”Wintrich didn’t know how to respond. But Mike Peinovich, a neo-Nazi who runs an alt-right podcast platform and is a close friend of Cipolla’s, did. Peinovich was watching the video online and chimed in through the Facebook comments: “It’s not like the holocaust because it actually happened.”Cipolla burst out laughing. “Mike, I love you,” he said. “You win best comment of the night.”Here they were, just a bunch of pals on the Young Republican club circuit making Holocaust jokes.

Simmons responded to screenwriter Jenny Lumet’s accusation that he sexually violated her in 1991 by issuing a statement apologizing for “thoughtless and insensitive” actions in previous relationships. He admitted that Lumet may have been frightened on the night of the alleged incident, but he denied that he forced himself on her.“While her memory of that evening is very different from mine, it is now clear to me that her feelings of fear and intimidation are real,” Simmons said. “While I have never been violent, I have been thoughtless and insensitive in some of my relationships over many decades and I sincerely apologize.”Munn wasn’t pleased with Simmons’ response and mockingly translated the statement using a “Douchebag Dictionary.”“Yo Russell, your statement was a little wonky, lemme help you out,” the “X-Men” star tweeted Thursday, along with a highlighted screenshot of Simmons’ statement.“According to the Douchebag Dictionary I believe your statement translates to ― Our memories are different because I see women as disposable entertainment and Jenny thought she was a human being. Oops!” Munn wrote.In a Thursday column for The Hollywood Reporter, Lumet described a night in 1991 filled with dread after Simmons allegedly offered her a ride home from a New York City restaurant but instead took her to his apartment.Lumet wrote that Simmons cornered her in the elevator, pressing into her with his body, hands and mouth. Then he moved her into the bedroom where, she said, he penetrated her. At no time, Lumet maintained, did she ever tell Simmons she wanted to have sex with him.“I desperately wanted to keep the situation from escalating,” Lumet wrote. “I wanted you to feel that I was not going to be difficult. I wanted to stay as contained as I could.”The daughter of acclaimed director Sidney Lumet is the second woman to publicly accuse the Def Jam Records co-founder of sexual assault. Earlier this month in the Los Angeles Times, Keri Claussen Khalighi accused Simmons of sexually assaulting her when she was 17 in 1991, while Simmons friend and filmmaker Brett Ratner allegedly did nothing to help her.Variety also reported this month that police investigated both Simmons and Ratner for alleged sexual battery of a 29-year-old woman in 2001, but no charges were brought.Munn herself is one of a growing number of women and men who have publicly outed their alleged sexual abusers and harassers ― many of whom held powerful positions ― in the wake of movie producer Harvey Weinstein’s downfall.Earlier this month, Munn alleged that Ratner had masturbated in front of her without her consent in 2004. She later told The New York Times that she doubted the increased awareness of sexual abuse in Hollywood would actually change the industry, saying that Ratner still had a $450 million deal with Warner Bros.“If you ask me, now, do I feel good? Do I feel like I have justice? No,” Munn told The New York Times. “There’s an understanding that there will be backlash in the marketplace and to their bottom line if they don’t make these big announcements.” But people like Ratner and Simmons, she said, “They aren’t woke; they’re scared.”"

Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mike-flynn-trump-russia-mueller-probe_us_5a219c0fe4b03c44072d64bc,Trump’s former national security adviser admitted lying to the FBI. Who’s next?,2017-12-01,Former national security adviser Michael Flynn leaves U.S. District Court in Washington on Friday morning. It looks like a bigger shoe could soon drop.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a219d791900004c0403404a.jpeg?cache=3mh5RRzqu5&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Former national security adviser Michael Flynn, the man President Donald Trump trusted with the nation’s closest-held secrets, is now a felon, admitting in federal court Friday that he lied to FBI agents just days after his former boss was sworn in as president. But it’s actually the relative non-severity of the charge against Flynn that should have Trump and his top aides worried.Flynn, who served as Trump’s national security adviser for 24 days before he was fired for reportedly lying to Vice President Mike Pence about the content of his discussions with the Russian ambassador weeks before Trump’s inauguration, had significant legal exposure. As did his son Michael Flynn Jr. So the fact that he struck a plea deal with just a single count that could potentially mean no prison time indicates he’s been able to leverage significant information on an even bigger target. In short, special counsel Robert Mueller’s team isn’t done yet.“Usually in government investigations they don’t cooperate down, they cooperate up,” Mark Lee, a former federal prosecutor, told HuffPost. “Gen. Flynn is probably a medium-sized fish. They’re looking for a bigger fish than him.”Trump has dismissed Mueller’s probe as a “witch hunt” and a “hoax,” and the White House is already trying to distance the administration from Flynn. But the investigation has already resulted in two guilty pleas ― from Flynn and former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos ― as well as hefty criminal charges against Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and his deputy Rick Gates. Now, armed with the cooperation of Flynn and Papadopoulos and with significant leverage against Manafort and Gates, Mueller’s team appears poised for another takedown. “Flynn would not be permitted to enter a plea bargain unless he had substantial credible evidence of criminal activity involving high-level members of the Trump campaign, including potentially the president himself,” Notre Dame Law School professor Jimmy Gurulé said. “Clearly this is not good news for President Trump.”Two individuals specifically referenced in court documents in connection with Flynn’s guilty plea Friday should be particularly nervous.First, there’s a “senior official” on the Trump transition team who was at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort on Dec. 29. According to his statement of offense, Flynn made a call that day to “a senior official” who was “with other senior members” of the transition team at Mar-a-Lago. This was the day after the Obama administration had announced sanctions against Russia in response to Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak had contacted Flynn for a chat.In that Dec. 29 call, Flynn and other members of the Trump transition team, according to the statement of offense, “discussed the U.S. Sanctions, including the potential impact of those sanctions on the incoming administration’s foreign policy goals.” Then, “immediately” after talking to the official, Flynn called the Russian ambassador and asked that Russia not escalate the situation. Fox News, CNN and ABC reported Friday that K.T. McFarland, a former top administration official Trump has nominated to become an ambassador, was the “senior official” in question.Second, there’s the “very senior member of the Presidential Transition Team” who, on Dec. 22, directed Flynn to call other countries, including Russia, to learn where governments stood on a U.N. Security Council resolution on Israeli settlements. Multiple outlets have reported that this is Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and adviser. Flynn, according to his statement of offense, requested that Russia either vote against or delay the resolution. Flynn admitted he lied when he told FBI agents that he asked only for their position on the vote and didn’t request they take any particular action.Flynn’s admissions that he acted on behalf of the Trump transition team to interfere with U.S. foreign policy raises the potential of charges under the Logan Act, a never-used 1799 statute than bans citizens from interfering in foreign relations, as well as potential other criminal statutes.As part of his plea deal, Flynn has agreed to “cooperate fully, truthfully, completely, and forthrightly” with Mueller’s office or any other federal, state and local law enforcement authorities Mueller’s office identifies where Flynn’s cooperation would be relevant. Flynn also must “promptly” turn over “any and all evidence of crimes” of which he’s aware.Ryan Reilly is HuffPost’s senior justice reporter, covering criminal justice, federal law enforcement and legal affairs.

And although the president provoked Clinton supporters who were aware of the retweets—95 percent said that they strongly disapproved—his base didn’t feel nearly as passionately. Fewer than half of Trump voters familiar with the posts said they strongly approved of him sharing the videos. (24 percent “somewhat” approved.) The propagandist videos in question were titled: “Muslim Destroys a Statue of Virgin Mary!” “Muslim migrant beats up Dutch boy on crutches!” and “Islamist mob pushes teenage boy off roof and beats him to death!” In sharing them, Trump retweeted Jayda Fransen, the deputy leader of Britain First, a fringe anti-immigration British group, multiple times. (Fransen was once charged with “religious aggravated harassment” and has been banned from entering mosques in England.) Although the unverified videos purported to show Muslims engaged in violence, one did not involve a Muslim migrant, and the others were based on four-year-old events and lacking context, according to the New York Times.While the president often uses Twitter to communicate to his more than 43 million followers, just 6 percent of Americans, including 9 percent of Clinton voters and 6 percent of Trump voters, actually saw the videos posted on the social network. Instead, 54 percent of Clinton voters and 28 percent of Trump voters said they “saw news stories about them.” Thirty-five percent of Clinton voters and more than 60 percent of Trump voters reported that they hadn’t seen anything at all about the posts.Nonetheless, of those Trump supporters who were aware of the videos, about half said the description of the videos were an “accurate depiction of events,” suggesting that when the president does share misleading content on Twitter, he may lend it an air of credibility. (Or affirm existing prejudices.) However, 36 percent of Trump voters weren’t sure if the descriptions were accurate. While, almost 80 percent of Clinton voters said they believed the titles were “factually inaccurate or misleading.”The White House—which noted that Trump may not have known about Fransen’s connection to Britain First when he tweeted his post—suggested that it doesn’t matter if the videos are real. What matters, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said, is that “the threat is real.”But even the president’s supporters aren’t wholeheartedly buying that argument: 46 percent of Trump voters say it does matter if the videos are real or not, while 31 percent say that it doesn’t. (More than 80 percent of Clinton voters argue that the truth matters.)Trump is now facing international condemnation for sharing the videos, including from British Prime Minister Theresa May, who called the retweets the “wrong thing to do” and denounced Britain First as a “hateful organization” that “seeks to spread mistrust and division in our communities.”  “Trump’s actions are putting the lives and safety of American Muslim children and families at risk,” said Nihad Awad, the national executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim civil rights group. But of those Trump voters who were aware of the videos, the vast majority—81 percent—said they did not see his retweets as an act of discrimination against Muslims. Clinton voters felt very differently: 94 percent said they were.Use the widget below to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Nov. 29-Dec. 1 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

28,HEALTHY LIVING,Companies Love Misery?,"David L. Katz, M.D., M.P.H., ContributorFounder, True Health Initiative",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/companies-love-misery_us_5a217f39e4b05072e8b56877,An article just published in the New England Journal of Medicine predicts the future prevalence of obesity among adults in,2017-12-01,<p>A sampling of new “kids’ cereals” introduced by major manufacturers in 2017</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a217f7c1500006f7585afd6.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"An article just published in the New England Journal of Medicine predicts the future prevalence of obesity among adults in the United States based on the current prevalence of childhood obesity, and simulation models incorporating prevailing patterns of weight change over time. The news is far from good. As stated succinctly by Reuters among the extensive media coverage, nearly 60% of American children are on track to be obese by age 35.This ominous figure may fail to impress for seeming too familiar. The combined prevalence of both overweight (a body mass index above 25) and obesity (a body mass index above 30) among adults in the U.S. is often cited as roughly 70%. The prevalence of obesity alone, however, is below 40%- so the newly published projections indicate a rather dire exacerbation of the nation’s obesity epidemic.The consequences of this would be hard to overstate. Obesity imposes a severe toll on physical and psychological health even during childhood. Those risks only increase over time, and pertain to lesser degrees of overweight as well as obesity.That latter point, that the risks of obesity apply to overweight as well, is a clarifying update to two prior and somewhat misguided notions. The first was that there is an “obesity paradox,” meaning a health advantage with at least some amount of overweight along with the obvious disadvantages attached to more severe obesity. The more recent and better quality research on this topic, however, indicates this is untrue; there is no obesity paradox. Being overweight throughout adulthood, let alone childhood, increases diverse health risks.The second contention that proves to be false is that “fitness” can fully compensate for the metabolic risks associated with “fatness.” The reality here, also clarified in the more research and carefully controlled studies, is that fitness and fatness both contribute independently to health status. Leaving aside the fact that few people manage to be both significantly fat and fit simultaneously, the evidence is now clear that at any given level of fitness, excess body fat still imposes metabolic harm. Some of that harm is now more or less common knowledge. Obesity is the primary driver of the type 2 diabetes epidemic affecting ever more of the modern and modernizing world. As recently as my own medical training, what is now called “type 2” diabetes was called adult-onset diabetes, to distinguish it from the type 1 variety that occurs in early childhood as the result of an auto-immune process. Over the span of my own medical career, I have witnessed the transformation of what was a metabolic disease generally limited to overweight, middle-aged adults into a pediatric scourge. That transition, and the accompanying name change, are attributable all but entirely to changing obesity trends.Obesity contributes significantly to the risk of heart disease and stroke. There is evidence that overweight and obesity contribute to the risk of dementia, much of which is thought to result from cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance, or both. Perhaps less well known is the contribution of obesity to the risk of nearly every kind of cancer. The role of obesity in many other varieties of chronic misery, from the constant pain of osteoarthritis, to the perennial exhaustion of sleep apnea, is well established.In short, obesity is intimately involved in the causal pathway to virtually all of the major plagues of modern epidemiology. And the new study indicates that the prevalence of obesity, and consequently of such plagues, will only rise.This is as much travesty as tragedy, because obesity, of course, is all but entirely preventable. Before we systematically eliminated physical activity from the typical daily routine, and made hyper-processed food continuously ubiquitous, obesity was very much the exception rather than the rule. In places where eating reliably involves real food and physical activity is culturally normal, it still is.There are public policies, particularly in the realm of behavioral economics that could make a sizable, salutary difference in the rates of chronic disease and obesity alike. But the most obvious of imperatives is to stop propagating obesity for profit.As long ago as 2006, we had clear information regarding widespread, sophisticated efforts by Big Food to manufacture a food supply that was, for all intents and purposes, willfully addictive. The story, reported in The Chicago Tribune, was an almost literal smoking gun: food industry and tobacco industry scientists were collaborating to study the effects of flavor combinations on brain activity in the service of selling us more of both products.Somehow, that stunning memo evoked little more than a cultural yawn, something I confess I have never understood. There is seemingly endless fascination in our culture with conspiracy theories, nearly all of which are nonsense. This was an actual conspiracy with massive, universal impact and dire consequences, and no one seemed to care.We obviously needed, and received, another prod when much the same message about a food supply willfully engineered to propagate overeating for the sake of profit was delivered by Pulitzer Prize winner, Michael Moss. But here we are nearly a half decade since that compelling reminder, which in turn followed the initial revelation by nearly a full decade, and it’s still just business as usual. Rates of obesity and related chronic disease and disability keep rising not because of any mystery we have yet to probe, but because we seem willing to mortgage the future health of our own children for the sake of corporate profits.The expression we all know is that misery loves company. The entirely unnecessary public health calamity of rampant and rising obesity rates makes we wonder if companies love our profitable misery.I very much doubt it. Executives and shareholders are people too; they have families too. Companies can’t possibly love the misery engendered by obesity, attendant chronic disease, and resulting premature death. But it hardly matters, because they certainly are willing to profit from it.-finDavid L.

29,POLITICS,Republicans Rewrite Portions Of Tax Bill Hours Before Vote,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-rewrite-tax-bill_us_5a20b157e4b03c44072c65ed,"Problems with a tax increase ""trigger"" cause an eleventh-hour scramble.",2017-12-01,"Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) had proposed a ""trigger"" to increase some taxes if revenue targets weren't reached. That appears to be off the table now.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a20b1a3150000707a85ad7b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Senate Republicans avoided the most embarrassing scenario for their tax bill Thursday ― an unexpected floor defeat that would have sent the legislation back to committee ― but they are still facing a significant stumbling block and, hours before a vote, are still changing portions of their bill.The “trigger” proposal from Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), which would have set off certain tax increases if Republicans didn’t hit revenue targets, was struck down by the Senate parliamentarian on Thursday afternoon. (Because of the restrictions that allow Republicans to pass their tax plan with a simple majority, provisions that don’t materially affect fiscal policies could be ruled subject to 60 votes.)So when the parliamentarian informed Corker that his trigger proposal wouldn’t fly, the GOP bill suddenly faced a problem. Without that provision, Corker didn’t feel comfortable voting for the bill, and he had reinforcements. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who has also been concerned about how much debt the bill would produce, as well as Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who has concerns about pass-through business tax provisions, both refused to vote against a Democratic motion to send the legislation back to committee until a fix could be worked out.Republicans held open a 15-minute vote for 62 minutes while Corker worked through possible fixes with Senate GOP leaders. Had Corker, Flake and Johnson voted no, the bill would have been sent back to the Finance Committee for three days and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) would have been dealt yet another surprising and embarrassing floor defeat. But leaders eventually worked out an agreement. Instead of increasing taxes if Republicans failed to hit revenue targets, the bill would simply act as if Republicans will not reach those targets and will therefore raise taxes in coming years.With that agreement, all three holdouts voted against the Democratic motion.Still, the deal puts Republicans in an awkward spot. “We have an alternative we don’t want to do to try to address Sen. Corker’s concerns,” Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) told reporters after the tense vote.According to Politico, Corker and Flake said Thursday night that the tax increases would kick in after six years ― with the idea that Congress could later waive those increases ― and would total roughly $350 billion. Late Thursday, the chatter in the Capitol was that Republicans may adjust the repeal of the alternative minimum tax, which ensures that certain individuals pay a baseline tax if they have high deductions, to pay for Corker’s demands. That would cause problems in the House, where Republicans have touted the repeal of the AMT as a significant feature of their tax plan.But another proposal on the table may be even more unpalatable for Republicans: raising the corporate rate.Currently, the corporate tax rate would go from 35 percent to 20 percent in both the House and Senate versions of the tax bill. But one idea is to raise the rate slightly in later years to offset some of the debt generated by the bill. (The Joint Committee on Taxation said Thursday that the Senate bill would increase debt by $1 trillion over 10 years even when projecting increased economic growth.)A higher corporate rate may actually be a stumbling block in the House. Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said Thursday morning that raising the corporate rate above 20 percent wouldn’t be acceptable for conservatives. “I’m going to be very clear,” Meadows said of a corporate rate higher than 20 percent, “that dog won’t hunt.”The trick to the supposed tax increases is to make it unlikely to come into effect, but not impossible. If the planned tax increase was completely unlikely, Corker probably wouldn’t go for it. If it’s too palatable, however, Democrats would never have any incentive to go along with future GOP proposals to prevent those increases, and some Republicans might also vote to let the tax raises come.In that sense, bringing back the alternative minimum tax could make some sense, but Republicans still don’t have a firm proposal ― at least not a public one ― with less than 20 hours before senators are expected to vote."

On Tuesday, the president reportedly confirmed his intention to do so in a call with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.The move will likely placate the Israeli government and conservative allies in the U.S. but may meet with a furious response from Palestinians and complicate the already daunting task of brokering an Israeli-Palestinian peace accord.Trump did not follow through on his promise during his first months in office, but facing a deadline this week, the president finally decided to move forward with the plan.Jerusalem contains holy sites for Muslims, Jews and Christians, and the city’s governance has long been contested. Israel has de facto control of the city since seizing its eastern part from Jordan in 1967, but the international community has refused to recognize that authority. Both Israelis and Palestinians consider the city their capital. The U.S. government has taken the stance that Israelis and Palestinians should determine the city’s status between themselves. Keeping the U.S. Embassy in the undisputed city of Tel Aviv has ensured that the U.S. wasn’t seen as taking a side on Jerusalem’s final status.While Congress passed a law in 1995 requiring the U.S. Embassy to be relocated to Jerusalem, every president since has signed a national security waiver every six months to delay the move. Like Trump, former presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton made vows to move the embassy but later decided not to pursue the relocation when faced with possible political repercussions.Trump, too, deferred the decision when the six-month deadline arrived in June. Moving the embassy could jeopardize Trump’s expressed hope that his administration would spearhead a peace process under the stewardship of White House adviser and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner. “We have spent a lot of time listening to and engaging with the Israelis, Palestinians and key regional leaders over the past few months to help reach an enduring peace deal,” Jason D. Greenblatt, the president’s special representative for international negotiations, told The New York Times in November.Greenblatt noted that the U.S. would not “impose a deal” but rather work to “facilitate ... a lasting peace agreement to improve the lives of Israelis and Palestinians and security across the region.”Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the U.S. Embassy “needs to be” in Jerusalem and would likely be happy to see Trump, whom he praised as a “true friend of the State of Israel,” make good on his promise.But current and former foreign policy officials have warned of the dangers of moving the embassy to Jerusalem.Former Secretary of State John Kerry, Jordanian King Abdullah II, Turkey’s President Tayyip Erdogan and senior Palestinian official and chief negotiator Saeb Erekat are among those who have cautioned of possible consequences.“Mr. Trump, Jerusalem is the red line of Muslims,” Erdogan said Monday. He also threatened to cut Turkey’s diplomatic ties with Israel. During his last weeks on the job, Kerry said placing the embassy in Jerusalem would cause an “absolute explosion” in the region and provoke widespread diplomatic backlash. King Abdullah II warned that the move could spark violence from Palestinians who have sought to secure the eastern part of the city as the future capital of a Palestinian state.Erekat said last year that the move would mean “the destruction of the peace process as a whole.”Mustafa Alani, a scholar at the Gulf Research Center, said moving the embassy could send the wrong signal as to Trump’s willingness to work with Arab nations.“This is a sign that he’s going to side with Israel,” Alani told The New York Times. “If he does it, it’s going to be a wrong start for his relationship with the Arab world.”Khaled Elgindy, a fellow in the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution, also warned in an op-ed that an embassy move could embolden extremists and affirm “the narratives of groups like ISIS and al-Qaida that the United States and Israel are waging a war against Islam.”On Friday, the Palestine Liberation Organization released a statement on Twitter by Nabil Abu Rudeineh, a spokesman for the Palestinian presidency.“To move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem or to recognize the city as the capital of Israel, both are equally dangerous to the future of the peace process & push the region into instability,” the statement read."

32,ARTS & CULTURE,Beastie Boys' Adam Horovitz Says He Believes Women Accusing His Father Of Sexual Assault,Antonia Blumberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/adam-horovitz-father-sexual-assault_us_5a209bcfe4b0a02abe8ff744,Multiple women say playwright Israel Horovitz assaulted them.,2017-12-01,"Adam Horovitz and his father, playwright Israel Horovitz, at New York City's Bleecker Street Theatre on March 31, 2010.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a209d6f1900004c04033d26.jpeg?cache=WB1bLvmucp&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Nine women have accused American playwright Israel Horovitz of sexual assault.A New York Times article published on Thursday details the women’s allegations, which range from accounts of forced kissing to rape. Two of the women were just 16 years old when the alleged assaults occurred.One of the playwright’s children, Adam Horovitz of the Beastie Boys, said he believes the women who have come forward against his father.“I believe the allegations against my father are true, and I stand behind the women that made them,” the hip-hop artist told the Times in a statement.One of the accusers, Jocelyn Meinhardt, had dated Adam Horovitz in high school. She was 19 years old when she started a summer fellowship with his father at the Gloucester Stage Company in Massachusetts, where the playwright served as artistic director.Meinhardt told the Times that on the first night of the fellowship, Israel Horovitz drove her to his family’s home, where he allegedly raped her.Like the other women who came forward, Meinhardt described Horovitz as someone she had looked up to, and who took advantage of her youth and respect to victimize her.“He was a good mentor, until he was the worst, probably most nightmarish mentor you could have,” Meinhardt said.Israel Horovitz, 78, said in a statement to the Times that he has “a different memory of some of these events.”But he added: “I apologize with all my heart to any woman who has ever felt compromised by my actions, and to my family and friends who have put their trust in me. To hear that I have caused pain is profoundly upsetting, as is the idea that I might have crossed a line with anyone who considered me a mentor.”The elder Horovitz is the author of more than 70 plays and multiple screenplays, including the adaptation of his stage play “My Old Lady,” which was released in 2014 and starred actors Maggie Smith and Kevin Kline.The accusations against the playwright are the latest in a string of sexual assault allegations that have rocked entertainment, media and politics. NBC’s Matt Lauer and Minnesota Public Radio’s Garrison Keillor were both fired from their positions on Wednesday amid allegations of sexual misconduct and improper behavior.Two more women accused Sen.

33,POLITICS,Michael Flynn’s Guilty Plea Pulls Vice President Pence Closer To Russia Spotlight,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mike-pence-michael-flynn-russia_us_5a219b12e4b03c44072d61f1,"Pence has tried to distance himself, but he’s supposedly the reason Trump’s national security adviser got fired.",2017-12-01,"They were all in the Oval Office together back in January: President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and national security adviser Michael Flynn (far right).",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a219b7c1900008c04034040.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― With Michael Flynn’s guilty plea bringing fresh attention to what Vice President Mike Pence knew about possible Russian collusion and when he knew it, Pence’s office has a ready answer: Not much and really late.So far Pence has remained at the periphery of special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation.He’s repeatedly toed the Trumpian line that any suggestion of collusion between the campaign and the Russians was nonsense. But he’s also pointed out that he wasn’t chosen as Donald Trump’s running mate until after the campaign started making contact with Russian officials. And he’s been careful to couch his own remarks about Russia with phrases like “I’m not aware” and “the president has made it very clear.”Now, Flynn’s guilty plea to a single count of lying to the FBI regarding his contacts with Russian officials moves Pence closer to the spotlight.When Flynn, Trump’s original national security adviser and longtime campaign aide, was fired just three weeks after the president took office, the purported reason was that Flynn had lied to Pence about his contacts with Russia during the transition ― a transition led by Pence himself.A White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said Pence felt “vindicated” by Flynn’s guilty plea as proof that Flynn had lied not only to Pence, but to federal authorities as well.That latest distancing remark follows a statement from Pence last month, after revelations that the president’s son, Donald Trump Jr., had worked with WikiLeaks to publicize stolen emails to hurt Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. U.S. intelligence has long considered WikiLeaks a virtual arm of Russian intelligence; an official January report specifically named the organization in finding that Russia had acted to help Trump win last year’s presidential election.In October of last year, Pence was asked if the Trump campaign had been working with WikiLeaks, and he denied it. On Nov. 13 of this year, the day that Trump Jr.’s cooperation with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was reported, Pence’s office released this statement: “The vice president was never aware of anyone associated with the campaign being in contact with WikiLeaks. He first learned of this news from a published report earlier tonight.”Those statements, though, will not be the end of the matter for Pence. His lawyer reportedly met with Mueller’s team this summer. And on Friday, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee asked Pence for information and documents pertaining to Flynn’s dealings with a number of foreign entities during the transition, including a scheme to kidnap and deliver a dissident cleric living in Pennsylvania to the government of Turkey.“Who on the Trump transition team was aware of Mr. Flynn’s relationship with the following entities,” wrote Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who then named Russia, Turkey, China and two lobbying firms.Flynn had a long career in military intelligence before he was fired by then-President Barack Obama from his job running the Defense Intelligence Agency. The retired Army general became one of Trump’s earliest high-profile supporters, earning a starring role at the Republican National Convention last summer where he encouraged chants of “lock her up” regarding Clinton.President Trump hired Flynn as his top national security aide even though he had reportedly been warned against it by both Obama and Trump’s original transition chief, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.Curiously, it was Flynn’s lying to Pence about conversations with then-Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak that was offered as the reason for Flynn’s firing, not the conversations themselves. Kislyak and Flynn talked about new sanctions that Obama had imposed on Russia for interfering in the presidential election. According to a document filed in the special counsel’s case on Friday, Flynn contacted transition team officials at Trump’s Palm Beach resort, Mar-a-Lago, on Dec. 29-31 to inform them of his conversations with Kislyak ― days on which Pence, who was still governor of Indiana, was in Indianapolis.“Mike Flynn is a fine person, and I asked for his resignation. He respectfully gave it. He is a man who ― there was a certain amount of information given to Vice President Pence, who is with us today. And I was not happy with the way that information was given,” Trump said at a Feb. 16 news conference. “He didn’t have to do that, because what he did wasn’t wrong ― what he did in terms of the information he saw.”The FBI interviewed Flynn about those conversations with Kislyak just four days after Trump took office, and the White House was warned about them on Jan. 26, when Acting Attorney General Sally Yates went to the Oval Office.Trump fired her days later. The stated reason was her refusal to defend his travel ban against several majority-Muslim nations in court."
34,WORLD NEWS,The Global Gag Rule Impacts Hard-Fought Progress On HIV/AIDS Relief,"Seema Jalan, ContributorExecutive Director, Universal Access Project",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-global-gag-rule-impacts-hard-fought-progress-on_us_5a2169dae4b0545e64bf9256,"The Trump administration not only reinstated the Global Gag Rule, it expanded it – by 15 times.",2017-12-01,<p><em>A community health worker in Uganda provides family planning services. Uganda will be severely impacted by the Global Gag Rule and has received HIV/AIDS relief funding under PEPFAR.</em></p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a2169e5140000c843b6aeb9.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When most people hear about the Global Gag Rule – the harmful U.S. policy that withholds funding from any international NGO that provides services for, information about, or references for abortion, even where it is legal, and even with its own private funds – they often think about the devastating impacts it will have on women’s and girls’ access to reproductive health and family planning services. And they should, because women lost access to contraceptive services and had more unintended pregnancies, and research shows the policy increased abortion rates (mostly unsafe abortions) last time it was enacted while reducing the availability of critical health care services for the world’s most marginalized women and girls. It’s been illegal for U.S. funds to pay for abortion since 1973, so what the Global Gag Rule really does is cut off funding for quality, accessible health care, especially in poverty-stricken areas of the world where it is needed the most.This time around, the policy is even more destructive. The Trump administration not only reinstated the Global Gag Rule, it expanded it – by 15 times. Now, it applies to all U.S. global health assistance – a total of about $9 billion, including international family planning and reproductive health, which is about $600 million. For the first time, funding for maternal and child health, nutrition, malaria, tuberculosis, infectious and tropical diseases and more is held hostage, and providers are forced to choose between offering comprehensive health care or receiving critical U.S. funding. Importantly, roughly two-thirds of the funding affected by the expanded Global Gag Rule is for HIV/AIDS programs around the world, under the president’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). PEPFAR, created in 2003 by the George W. Bush administration, has received broad bipartisan support and has been successful in reaching more than 13.3 million men, women, and children with lifesaving antiretroviral treatment. The latest PEPFAR data also shows significant declines in new HIV diagnoses among adolescent girls and young women for the first time.What does this all mean for global health headway on HIV/AIDS? In short: The expansion of the Global Gag Rule will roll back hard-fought progress and long-standing U.S. leadership on HIV/AIDS relief around the world, especially for key populations on the front lines of efforts to fight HIV. It reverses global efforts to integrate HIV and sexual and reproductive health programs and services, a best practice in health care service delivery as there may only be one clinic serving an entire population. While globally, the number of HIV-related deaths has been cut nearly in half since the height of the epidemic, HIV is still a leading cause of death of women of reproductive age in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in Africa.It’s too soon to say just how far back this policy will take us. But if history serves as any indicator, it is likely to be tragic. In its previous iterations, when it applied to reproductive health and family planning funding and PEPFAR was not included, the Global Gag Rule sparked a ripple of impact on efforts to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS. Research by Fordham University under George W. Bush’s Global Gag Rule documented the broad impact of the policy on community-level HIV/AIDS services and condom distribution programs in Kenya. For example, having lost U.S. funding under the policy, Marie Stopes International (MSI) closed its clinic in Kisumu, a region in Kenya with the highest HIV infection in the country. The clinic’s more than 400 clients, including HIV/AIDS patients, were left without accessible, quality health care as there were no comparable alternatives.The MSI clinic closure in Kisumu is just one example of the harm the Global Gag Rule can have on a broad range of health care for those who need it most; it’s a false dichotomy to have to choose between providing lifesaving HIV/AIDS therapy or lifesaving reproductive health services. Under the expanded policy, closures like this will be just the tip of the iceberg, and in the end, the fundamental right to quality, accessible health care for vulnerable families and communities will be jeopardized and our country’s progress on global health will be undermined.As we continue to track the impacts of this reinstated and expanded Global Gag Rule, our elected officials – and we, as the constituents that hold them accountable – must ensure that the health and rights of the world’s most marginalized people are not forgotten. It’s the best of American values.Learn more about the Universal Access Project and get involved at www.universalaccessproject.org."

The original warrant laid out terms for Garcia Zarate’s release in 2015 on a federal sentence for illegally re-entering the U.S. The terms barred him from committing a crime or possessing a firearm, CBS News reported. On Thursday, Garcia Zarate was found guilty of firearm possession in the Steinle homicide case.Previously:Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico, was found not guilty Thursday in the homicide of Kate Steinle, a case that has become a flashpoint for the right in calling for stricter immigration rules.Garcia Zarate was accused of fatally shooting Steinle in July 2015 when she was walking on Pier 14 in San Francisco with her father. The jury acquitted him of murder and manslaughter charges and convicted him of a lesser felony charge of gun possession, reported the San Francisco Chronicle. Garcia Zapata, who was homeless, had multiple felony convictions and had been deported five times before Steinle’s death, The New York Times reported. He had been released from jail months before the shooting, despite federal immigration requests to hold him for deportation. Hours after the verdict, federal immigration officials said he would be deported, according to The Associated Press. “This case was never ... about Ms. Steinle,” University of Denver law professor Christopher Lasch, who published a paper about Steinle’s death and its role in the national debate on immigration, told KQED in an interview before the verdict. “It was about the idea of a person who had been deported committing a crime. And no matter how much nuance you layer onto the facts after that initial characterization, the narrative won’t change.”U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a fierce opponent of sanctuary cities, said in a statement Thursday: “When jurisdictions choose to return criminal aliens to the streets rather than turning them over to federal immigration authorities, they put the public’s safety at risk. San Francisco’s decision to protect criminal aliens led to the preventable and heartbreaking death of Kate Steinle.”While Garcia Zarate admitted he had fired the weapon, he said hitting Steinle was an accident. The bullet had ricocheted off the ground and then hit her in the back.Garcia Zarate had a criminal history including a marijuana charge and several incidents of illegal reentry ― but no violence, reported KQED. For sanctuary cities like San Francisco, local law enforcement will often only hand over immigrants to Immigration and Customs Enforcement if they are connected to more serious crimes. But as a sanctuary city, San Francisco police don’t necessarily have to communicate or comply with ICE requests in such cases ― in an effort to encourage a better relationship between undocumented immigrants and local law enforcement. President Donald Trump, who infamously referred to Mexican immigrants as “criminals” during his campaign and has repeatedly referred to the Steinle case over the years, called the verdict “disgraceful” Thursday night on Twitter. He followed up on Friday morning with a plea to build his long-proposed wall on the Mexican border.Later on Friday, the White House doubled down on its critique of the verdict. “Had San Francisco enforced our Nation’s immigration laws, the Steinle family would be celebrating this holiday with all of their loved ones,” Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement. Conservatives have seized on the case to try to paint sanctuary cities as dangerous to the public.After the jury verdict Thursday, right-wing figureheads, including former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin and conservative media pundit Ann Coulter, sent Twitter messages denouncing “illegal aliens” and demanding tougher immigration enforcement. Steinle’s family has complained in the past about Trump using Kate’s death as a talking point.Her parents told the Chronicle that, while they support sanctuary cities’ role in ensuring immigrants can turn to police for help without fearing deportation, they think the city should not have so severely limited its cooperation with federal immigration authorities. “We just want to get this over with and move on with our lives, and think about Kate on our terms,” Jim Steinle, Kate’s father, told the Chronicle before the verdict was announced. “Nothing’s been on our terms. It’s been on everyone else’s terms.”This article has been updated with immigration officials saying Garcia Zarate will be deported and to add Donald Trump’s reaction on Twitter."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a21ec411900008c04034145.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Dec 1 (Reuters) - Charlottesville authorities failed to protect public safety and free speech during a white nationalist rally over Confederate statues that turned deadly in the Virginia college town in August, an independent review said on Friday.The violence between counter-protesters and white nationalists, who were outraged by the city’s plan to remove a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee, marked an eruption in tensions over the symbols of the Civil War’s losing side.A 32-year-old woman was killed when a car plowed into a group of counter-demonstrators.Friday’s three-month review by former U.S. attorney Timothy Heaphy faulted law enforcement agencies for breakdowns in planning and coordination as well as a timid response that led to “disastrous results.”“The city was unable to protect the right of free expression and facilitate the permit holder’s offensive speech,” said the report commissioned by Charlottesville officials to address criticism of the response to the Aug. 12 “Unite the Right” rally.“This represents a failure of one of the government’s core functions — the protection of fundamental rights.”Charlottesville police declined to comment. The Virginia State Police said in a statement that they spent weeks planning but it was difficult to account for every circumstance.City Manager Maurice Jones said in a statement he did not agree with all of the findings but was “profoundly sorry” for falling short of expectations. He said the city was developing a plan to address the issues.Residents of Charlottesville, home to the University of Virginia, demanded answers about the violence. Other cities across the U.S. South have since acted to remove monuments to the Confederacy.Heaphy, whose team interviewed 150 people, said no police officer he spoke to felt good about what happened.Officers were not properly trained or deployed, Heaphy said. State and city police used different radio systems during the rally so they could not communicate effectively.Heaphy said Charlottesville wrongly believed it could not ban protesters from carrying items such as clubs and shields, and city and state police took too passive an approach when clashes broke out.“Despite clear evidence of violence, police consistently failed to intervene, de-escalate, or otherwise respond,” the report said. “These shortcomings contributed to a chaotic series of events that led to violence and death.”Among the recommendations made by Heaphy’s team were that authorities should react more quickly to violence, as well as communicate better with the public before and after such events.The report said Charlottesville Police Chief Al Thomas sought to limit information requested by Heaphy’s team and deleted text messages relevant to the review. Thomas denied efforts to hide information, the report added.Thomas said on Friday he was committed to implementing the report’s recommendations.“It’s not a time for finger-pointing. It’s a time to come together,” he said in comments reported by CNN. "

But newly discovered audio of a speech he gave several years ago reveals just how far the evangelical Christian politician is willing to go to justify a cruel, distorted and dangerous view of the Bible.On Thursday, Think Progress shared audio they said is from a speech Moore gave in 2008 for a controversial (and now defunct) evangelical organization called Vision Forum. In the speech, the Southern Baptist former judge voiced a number of troubling beliefs about morality and queer sexuality, at one point comparing the rise of the queer rights movement to the rise of the Nazi regime during World War II.In the speech and a subsequent Q&A session, Moore, who is currently battling sexual assault allegations, reiterated his belief that all morality comes from God. He points to Nazi Germany as an example of a country that lost its moral compass when it prioritized the state above God.“Without morality, without God, the only power is the power of man,” he said in audio uploaded to Sound Cloud by Think Progress. “And as demonstrated in Nazi Germany, that results in an ultimate power given over to the state to commit murder.” He later compared the loss of morality that occurred in Nazi Germany to the deterioration of morality he believes is illustrated by the modern-day movement for marriage equality. Just two weeks before the 2008 speech, Think Progress reports, California’s Supreme Court had struck down the state’s ban on same-sex marriage. “This is a spiritual battle in which everything of God is being attacked, and that’s what it’s about,” Moore said. “It’s not just about the institution of marriage, it’s about the institution of parents’ rights over their children, it’s about every kind of sexual thing you can imagine, which I won’t go into, but it’s destroying anything about God.”For Moore, the California Supreme Court decision was proof of the moral decay of the nation. “It’s not too many years from now when another judge is going to come along and allow one man to marry 10 women, or a man to marry his two daughters,” he said. “Because you see, when there are no standards, there are no standards and they’ll come along and make up the standard as they go.” The California Supreme Court decision was later upended by Proposition 8, a state ballot measure that banned same-sex marriage and was finally thrown out in 2012. Marriage equality became legal nationwide in 2015.When prompted during the Q&A, Moore also cited a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that struck down sodomy laws as one of the worst decisions the court ever handed down.“I think that was a devastating opinion,” he said about the 2003 Lawrence V. Texas decision, which ensured that queer Americans across the country no longer had to worry about being arrested, hauled to jail and fined simply for having sex. Moore’s campaign has not responded to a HuffPost request for comment.Moore has a long history of spouting anti-queer rhetoric. He’s repeatedly said that he believes “homosexual conduct” should be illegal. In 2016, he was suspended from his post as Alabama’s Supreme Court chief justice for instructing probate judges to refuse to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples in compliance with federal law.While Moore is an outlier for his openly blunt, brash and violent rhetoric on queer sexuality, his line of thinking ― that homosexuality is not part of God’s plan for the world, and that Christians are called to resist its growing cultural acceptance ― is not at all uncommon among conservative Christians. Brandan Robertson, a progressive, queer Christian activist, told HuffPost that Moore’s perspective on sexuality and gender identity is taught at many Southern Baptist churches today. It is a system that Robertson believes is inherently patriarchal, and that denies the liberation and equality of women, queer people and people of color. But Robertson believes the Jesus of the Bible preached a radical message of liberation and equality.″[Roy Moore’s theology] flies in the face of everything that Jesus preached and embodied,” Robertson said. “It’s about preserving privilege and power, not about defending families or protecting morality.”Ross Murray, senior director of education and training for the advocacy group GLAAD, told HuffPost that he believes this kind of preaching doesn’t exist in a vacuum ― instead it has a direct and dangerous impact on the lives and well-being of LGBTQ people, resulting in violence against queer people, youth homelessness and domestic abuse. Murray is also the founder and director of The Naming Project, a faith-based camp for LGBTQ youth and their allies. He said that when he hears Moore’s words about queer sexuality, his concern immediately goes to young people. “I want them to be safe and protected from harm,” Murray said. “Unfortunately, Roy Moore is a source of harm, not only in his direct words and actions, but also for others who may take his words to a violent end.”“Thankfully, more and more Christians, including evangelical Christians, are abandoning that toxic line of thinking, recognizing that LGBTQ people are children of God, created in God’s image, and worthy of their love and support.”"

Marriage equality became legal nationwide in 2015.When prompted during the Q&A, Moore also cited a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that struck down sodomy laws as one of the worst decisions the court ever handed down.“I think that was a devastating opinion,” he said about the 2003 Lawrence V. Texas decision, which ensured that queer Americans across the country no longer had to worry about being arrested, hauled to jail and fined simply for having sex. Moore’s campaign has not responded to a HuffPost request for comment.Moore has a long history of spouting anti-queer rhetoric. He’s repeatedly said that he believes “homosexual conduct” should be illegal. In 2016, he was suspended from his post as Alabama’s Supreme Court chief justice for instructing probate judges to refuse to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples in compliance with federal law.While Moore is an outlier for his openly blunt, brash and violent rhetoric on queer sexuality, his line of thinking ― that homosexuality is not part of God’s plan for the world, and that Christians are called to resist its growing cultural acceptance ― is not at all uncommon among conservative Christians. Brandan Robertson, a progressive, queer Christian activist, told HuffPost that Moore’s perspective on sexuality and gender identity is taught at many Southern Baptist churches today. It is a system that Robertson believes is inherently patriarchal, and that denies the liberation and equality of women, queer people and people of color. But Robertson believes the Jesus of the Bible preached a radical message of liberation and equality.″[Roy Moore’s theology] flies in the face of everything that Jesus preached and embodied,” Robertson said. “It’s about preserving privilege and power, not about defending families or protecting morality.”Ross Murray, senior director of education and training for the advocacy group GLAAD, told HuffPost that he believes this kind of preaching doesn’t exist in a vacuum ― instead it has a direct and dangerous impact on the lives and well-being of LGBTQ people, resulting in violence against queer people, youth homelessness and domestic abuse. Murray is also the founder and director of The Naming Project, a faith-based camp for LGBTQ youth and their allies. He said that when he hears Moore’s words about queer sexuality, his concern immediately goes to young people. “I want them to be safe and protected from harm,” Murray said. “Unfortunately, Roy Moore is a source of harm, not only in his direct words and actions, but also for others who may take his words to a violent end.”“Thankfully, more and more Christians, including evangelical Christians, are abandoning that toxic line of thinking, recognizing that LGBTQ people are children of God, created in God’s image, and worthy of their love and support.”"

43,POLITICS,Senate Republicans Don't Care If Their Tax Bill Is Unpopular,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senate-republicans-tax-bill-unpopular_us_5a20968de4b03350e0b58941,"The polls are wrong, the opposition is distorting the truth, and tax cuts are ""generally unpopular.""",2017-12-01,"""I can show you a poll for anything,"" said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a20971d140000c543b6ac8d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Senate Republicans look at their tax bill as a key win for the GOP ― a sweeping rewrite that Republicans can point to proudly in upcoming elections. But there’s one big problem lawmakers are ignoring: Voters don’t like the bill.In poll after poll, more voters say they oppose this tax proposal than support it. According to FiveThirtyEight, of the nine largest tax bills over the last 36 years ― two of which were strictly tax increases ― this Republican measure ranks dead last, with its approval rating underwater by an average of 14 points.But that would apparently be news to GOP senators. As they race to pass the bill, they either don’t know, don’t care or don’t trust data suggesting their legislation will be far from a saving grace next November.When HuffPost asked Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) why the bill has polled so poorly, he said that was because “it hadn’t been written yet.”“We’re not through yet,” Cornyn said, noting that Senate Republicans still intend to go to conference over the legislation with the House. But he also said that some of the hostility toward the bill existed because “people have just lied about it and misrepresented what’s in it,” and he suggested the polling was faulty.“I can show you a poll for anything,” he said.That was a common reaction among Republicans. Rather than their having drafted an unpopular bill, they just think the polls are wrong.“Depends on who does the polling,” Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) said Thursday. “I don’t know much about reporting, but I know how to read a poll.”Kennedy said he had seen polls showing that the bill was “very popular,” and he suggested there were methodological issues with surveys indicating otherwise. “Depends on how you ask the question. Depends on what your sample is. Depends on whether you use landlines or cell phones,” he said. “You can make a poll walk, talk, do whatever you want.”There is some variance in polling on the tax bill. But the legislation has consistently tested poorly with the public.At least one GOP senator suggested that it was more important to poll well with Republicans in particular.“It depends on what universe you’re after,” Sen. Jim Inhofe told HuffPost. “If you’re talking about Republicans, they are for it.”Inhofe, who comes from the deeply red state of Oklahoma, said this bill was probably the first or second most important piece of legislation to Republicans, particularly those who want President Donald Trump to succeed. And if there was a messaging failure, Inhofe said, it was in Republicans not adequately selling the bill as a tax cut.A number of other senators didn’t think there was anything lawmakers could have done to sell the legislation more effectively.“I don’t want to say it’s a messaging failure,” Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) said Thursday. “I just think that the information on the opposite side is so distorted and sensational that it skews the truth of the actual results of the bill.”The truth of the GOP tax plan has been hotly debated. Republicans started this discussion by insisting that their bill would be targeted to aid the middle class, that it wouldn’t significantly help the wealthy, that it wouldn’t add to the debt, that it would spur significant economic growth.Analysis after analysis, however, has challenged those GOP claims. That in turn has caused Republicans to trash the analyses. The Tax Policy Center, for instance, said 47 percent of the benefits of the House’s tax bill would go toward the richest 1 percent, so Republicans painted the nonpartisan center as liberal and said it couldn’t “compute straight.” When a Joint Committee on Taxation report came out Thursday calculating that, even in a dynamic score accounting for increased growth effects, the Senate bill would still add more than a trillion dollars to the debt, Republicans just ignored it. Same with the committee’s lackluster growth expectations.But Republicans aren’t questioning any of their own assumptions about their tax bill. They’re just pressing on, apparently convinced that the opposition is either fake news or simply wrong.When HuffPost asked Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) about the bill’s unpopularity, he said it was practically impossible to sell tax cuts before they’re passed. “Tax cuts are generally unpopular,” he said ― a claim that is historically inaccurate.Tillis told a story about passing tax cuts in North Carolina when he was speaker of the statehouse. A colleague came up to him before the vote and cited some polls showing opposition to the state GOP’s proposal. Tillis told his colleague that Republicans were going to get crushed in the press until they produced a result.“We don’t produce a result until we vote,” Tillis said. “And when we vote, I think that the result ― I’m telling you, at the end of the day, if you go back in history, up to and including 1986, and think people were out parading with pep rallies saying, ‘Go and pass that bill’? Go back and do your history.”(While the 1986 tax reform wasn’t overwhelmingly popular, it did have a positive approval rating at the time: 38 percent to 34 percent.)Still, Tillis said it’s much harder to build support for GOP proposals today with opponents using tools like Facebook and Twitter, and he suggested he had no qualms about passing a bill that a plurality of Americans oppose.“It’s just a function of the messaging space that we’re in,” he said."

The news comes on the heels of the media company suspending Jason Mojicam, the head of Vice’s documentary film unit, days after the Daily Beast published an article detailing the company’s relaxed attitude toward workplace sexual harassment claims.Employees working at the New York-based company have described an increasingly tense work environment, especially after Vice Media CEO Shane Smith delivered a company-wide “State of the Union” address that failed to mention the Daily Beast report and the suspension that occurred mere hours earlier.In addition to the Daily Beast coverage, The New York Times reportedly has been working on a story about sexual harassment allegations at Vice Media. HuffPost’s Ashley Feinberg spoke with seven current Vice employees who described frustrations with management boiling over as the company tried to preempt an exposé that’s expected to include allegations that are worse than anything previously reported.In a memo obtained by CNN on Thursday, Vice’s global head of human resources, Susan Tohyama, wrote that the conduct of the fired employees “ranged from verbal to sexual harassment to other behavior that is inconsistent with our policies, our values, and the way in which we believe colleagues should work together.” She also included “an easy-to-follow roadmap” for employees wanting to file official complaints.Tohyama added that she would not share specifics regarding the complaints or the discipline taken so she could protect a process that would ensure employees felt safe about bringing forth allegations. “I want to say again how important it is that you report any inappropriate conduct that you’ve experienced or witnessed,” Tohyama wrote in her memo. “Working together we can move forward to ensure this is an inclusive, fair, safe, creative and fun place to be.”"

Lauer’s case is the latest among numerous high-profile cases, where prominent entertainment personalities have been accused of sexual misconduct.Bill O’Reilly was fired from Fox News after news outlets reported that the network paid out millions of dollars to settle sexual harassment cases filed against him. Producer Brett Ratner has been accused of sexual harassment and assault by numerous women, and to date at least 60 women have accused producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual harassment and assault. Weinstein was forced to step down from his position at the Weinstein Company; he was ousted from the Motion Picture Academy of Arts and Science; and the Producer’s Guild of America (PGA) voted to expel him.We are in the middle of a revolution in this country, which has changed the way employers handle allegations of sexual abuse involving powerful men. Without a doubt the women who came forward with sexual assault allegations against actor-comedian, Bill Cosby, started that revolution.The decision of Cosby’s accusers to go public with their allegations caused a cataclysmic shift in the way we view sexual assault and how we now treat the women who come forward to report these incidents. The swiftness with which NBC dealt with the allegations against Lauer is evidence of this change.The Cosby accusers were courageous she-warriors who demanded justice and created a path for other survivors to follow. The women were accused by Cosby and his defenders of being unreliable, dishonest, and opportunistic. Their reputations were attacked, and the allegations against Cosby were dismissed by many as untrue.Even in the face of much opposition, the women insisted on telling their truth about Cosby’s alleged misconduct. Most of these women were not celebrities when they came forward to accuse Cosby of drugging and sexually assaulting them.They met Cosby in the 60s, 70s, and 80s when they were aspiring actresses and models. Most of the accusers allege that Cosby initially offered career advice and assistance, but ultimately betrayed them by forcing the women to participate in unwanted sexual activity.In 2014, when a majority of the women started to publicly accuse Cosby of sexual abuse they were grandmothers, mothers, housewives, and working women who had left behind dreams of stardom, but alleged years later that unpleasant memories of an encounter with Cosby continued to haunt them. Despite many challenges these women joined together and became stronger in the telling and retelling of their stories.The Cosby accusers taught women that we are empowered by speaking out and reporting the alleged abuser, and that the act of speaking out may motivate other victims to come forward. To date almost 60 women have accused Cosby of sexual assault, and he is still facing sexual assault charges in Pennsylvania. Cosby has denied the charges against him.The reverberations of the revolution that the Cosby accusers started can now be felt from Hollywood to the halls of Congress. Unfortunately, some of the results have been unexpected and disheartening. Veteran journalist Charlie Rose was terminated as co-host of “CBS This Morning” based on allegations that he was sexually inappropriate with co-workers on his PBS show.Academy award winning actor Kevin Spacey was fired from the Netflix drama “House of Cards” for alleged inappropriate behavior with young men. Senator Al Franken has come under scrutiny for harassing behavior and a sexually inappropriate photograph he took of a woman in 2006, which permanently immortalized his poor judgment.Alabama senatorial candidate Roy Moore is facing allegations of sexual misconduct with a minor. Congressman John Conyers, the longest serving representative in the House, is being investigated by the House Ethics Committee for allegations of harassment and inappropriate conduct. Although Conyers has denied the charges, he still faces an inquiry that could damage his reputation and his legacy.California Congresswoman, Jackie Speier, who reported she was sexually harassed by a superior while working as a staffer on Capitol Hill, has introduced bipartisan legislation calling for a reform of the Congressional sexual harassment policy. The current policy requires employees to participate in a lengthy, multi-tiered process, which includes in-house counseling and mediation with the alleged perpetrator before a formal complaint can be filed.Representative Speier told her story of harassment and joined the #MeToo campaign, which encourages the survivors of sexual harassment and assault to share their stories of survival. The campaign has gone global and the hashtag #MeToo has been tweeted over a million times on Twitter.We have made progress in this country by creating a new dialogue to discuss sexual harassment in the work place, but it can’t stop with just words. We need to create new policies with teeth. We need to ensure that female employees across all industries are afforded effective options to report sexual abuse and given appropriate redress. The legislation introduced by Representative Speier is an example of turning words into action, but we need to do so much more to ensure that freedom from workplace sexual harassment becomes a reality.The Cosby accusers started a revolution without firing a shot. They spoke to power and demanded to be heard, and the walls came tumbling down like the walls of Jericho when Joshua’s priests marched around the city and blew their mighty horns.The Cosby accusers created a new paradigm for discussing and addressing sexual abuse and harassment in this country.

Lauer’s case is the latest among numerous high-profile cases, where prominent entertainment personalities have been accused of sexual misconduct.Bill O’Reilly was fired from Fox News after news outlets reported that the network paid out millions of dollars to settle sexual harassment cases filed against him. Producer Brett Ratner has been accused of sexual harassment and assault by numerous women, and to date at least 60 women have accused producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual harassment and assault. Weinstein was forced to step down from his position at the Weinstein Company; he was ousted from the Motion Picture Academy of Arts and Science; and the Producer’s Guild of America (PGA) voted to expel him.We are in the middle of a revolution in this country, which has changed the way employers handle allegations of sexual abuse involving powerful men. Without a doubt the women who came forward with sexual assault allegations against actor-comedian, Bill Cosby, started that revolution.The decision of Cosby’s accusers to go public with their allegations caused a cataclysmic shift in the way we view sexual assault and how we now treat the women who come forward to report these incidents. The swiftness with which NBC dealt with the allegations against Lauer is evidence of this change.The Cosby accusers were courageous she-warriors who demanded justice and created a path for other survivors to follow. The women were accused by Cosby and his defenders of being unreliable, dishonest, and opportunistic. Their reputations were attacked, and the allegations against Cosby were dismissed by many as untrue.Even in the face of much opposition, the women insisted on telling their truth about Cosby’s alleged misconduct. Most of these women were not celebrities when they came forward to accuse Cosby of drugging and sexually assaulting them.They met Cosby in the 60s, 70s, and 80s when they were aspiring actresses and models. Most of the accusers allege that Cosby initially offered career advice and assistance, but ultimately betrayed them by forcing the women to participate in unwanted sexual activity.In 2014, when a majority of the women started to publicly accuse Cosby of sexual abuse they were grandmothers, mothers, housewives, and working women who had left behind dreams of stardom, but alleged years later that unpleasant memories of an encounter with Cosby continued to haunt them. Despite many challenges these women joined together and became stronger in the telling and retelling of their stories.The Cosby accusers taught women that we are empowered by speaking out and reporting the alleged abuser, and that the act of speaking out may motivate other victims to come forward. To date almost 60 women have accused Cosby of sexual assault, and he is still facing sexual assault charges in Pennsylvania. Cosby has denied the charges against him.The reverberations of the revolution that the Cosby accusers started can now be felt from Hollywood to the halls of Congress. Unfortunately, some of the results have been unexpected and disheartening. Veteran journalist Charlie Rose was terminated as co-host of “CBS This Morning” based on allegations that he was sexually inappropriate with co-workers on his PBS show.Academy award winning actor Kevin Spacey was fired from the Netflix drama “House of Cards” for alleged inappropriate behavior with young men. Senator Al Franken has come under scrutiny for harassing behavior and a sexually inappropriate photograph he took of a woman in 2006, which permanently immortalized his poor judgment.Alabama senatorial candidate Roy Moore is facing allegations of sexual misconduct with a minor. Congressman John Conyers, the longest serving representative in the House, is being investigated by the House Ethics Committee for allegations of harassment and inappropriate conduct. Although Conyers has denied the charges, he still faces an inquiry that could damage his reputation and his legacy.California Congresswoman, Jackie Speier, who reported she was sexually harassed by a superior while working as a staffer on Capitol Hill, has introduced bipartisan legislation calling for a reform of the Congressional sexual harassment policy. The current policy requires employees to participate in a lengthy, multi-tiered process, which includes in-house counseling and mediation with the alleged perpetrator before a formal complaint can be filed.Representative Speier told her story of harassment and joined the #MeToo campaign, which encourages the survivors of sexual harassment and assault to share their stories of survival. The campaign has gone global and the hashtag #MeToo has been tweeted over a million times on Twitter.We have made progress in this country by creating a new dialogue to discuss sexual harassment in the work place, but it can’t stop with just words. We need to create new policies with teeth. We need to ensure that female employees across all industries are afforded effective options to report sexual abuse and given appropriate redress. The legislation introduced by Representative Speier is an example of turning words into action, but we need to do so much more to ensure that freedom from workplace sexual harassment becomes a reality.The Cosby accusers started a revolution without firing a shot. They spoke to power and demanded to be heard, and the walls came tumbling down like the walls of Jericho when Joshua’s priests marched around the city and blew their mighty horns.The Cosby accusers created a new paradigm for discussing and addressing sexual abuse and harassment in this country. We have all benefited from their courage and determination, and we owe these women our gratitude.The views expressed here, are the opinions of the writer and do not represent the views of any agency or organization."
49,QUEER VOICES,Trump Excludes LGBTQ People From World AIDS Day Proclamation,Curtis M. Wong,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-world-aids-day_us_5a2073ace4b0a02abe8fc6b3,The president's tribute to those living with HIV felt lacking at best.,2017-11-30,The president's oversight felt very much in line with his decision not to acknowledge Pride Month in June. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a2074b5140000bc43b6abd6.jpeg?cache=HI5f9sgeQZ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump’s effort to commemorate those affected by HIV/AIDS this week seemed to overlook many affected by the epidemic.“On this day, we pray for all those living with HIV, and those who have lost loved ones to AIDS,” Trump wrote in a proclamation issued Thursday to commemorate World AIDS Day on Dec. 1.“As we remember those who have died and those who are suffering, we commend the immense effort people have made to control and end the HIV/AIDS epidemic,” his statement continued.World AIDS Day, first commemorated in 1988, aims to raise international awareness of the disease. An estimated 36.7 million people are living with HIV/AIDS around the world, with 1.1 million of those residing in the U.S.Noticeably absent from the proclamation were any references to communities most at risk of HIV infection, including LGBTQ people and people of color. The omissions are perhaps more startling when given the statistics: In 2015, 48 percent of those diagnosed with AIDS in the U.S. were African-Americans. In 2014, the Centers for Disease Control found that gay and bisexual men made an an estimated 70 percent of new HIV infections in the U.S. Though data on the transgender community is limited, the CDC also found that an estimated 22 percent of all trans women are HIV positive. Trump’s statement referenced “tens of thousands of Americans” who are infected each year, but otherwise steered clear of specifics. He did, however, highlight “adolescent girls and young women in some sub-Saharan African countries.”It didn’t take long for LGBTQ rights advocates to take note of the omissions. Trump’s words were in stark contrast to those of former President Barack Obama.“Although we have come far in recent decades, our work is not yet done and the urgency to intervene in this epidemic is critical,” Obama wrote in 2016. “Gay and bisexual men, transgender people, youth, black and Latino Americans, people living in the Southern United States, and people who inject drugs are at a disproportionate risk.” The oversight, unfortunately, felt in line with Trump’s record on LGBTQ issues thus far, particularly his silence on Pride Month, the annual month dedicated to the LGBTQ community, in June.

John McCain (R-Ariz.) said Thursday that he will support the Senate tax reform bill.“After careful thought and consideration, I have decided to support the Senate tax reform bill,” he said in a statement. “I believe this legislation, though far from perfect, would enhance American competitiveness, boost the economy, and provide long overdue tax relief for middle class families.”The controversial bill would mostly cut taxes for corporations and wealthy Americans. A vote on its final passage could happen as early as Thursday.McCain voted against tax cuts during President George W. Bush’s administration in both 2001 and 2003, noting that those bills would have had a negative effect on the national debt.The senator said the tax bill has no effect on his arguments for health care reform.“As a matter of principle, I’ve always supported individual liberty and believe the federal government should not penalize Americans who cannot afford to purchase expensive health insurance,” he said. “By repealing the individual mandate, this bill would eliminate an onerous tax that especially harms those from low-income brackets. In my home state of Arizona, 80 percent of people who currently pay the individual mandate penalty earn less than $50,000 per year.”McCain’s statement about the tax bill ends with his acknowledgement of the “concerns some of my Senate colleagues have raised about the impact of this bill on the deficit.”“It’s clear this bill’s net effect on our economy would be positive,” he said. “This is not a perfect bill, but it is one that would deliver much-needed reform to our tax code, grow the economy, and help Americans keep more of their hard-earned money.” "

And she’s taking down critics of the Miss Universe pageant along the way.Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters, who hails from South Africa and was crowned on Sunday night, thinks beauty pageants like Miss Universe are more relevant than ever. “I see this as a platform that I’ve got to make a meaningful difference in the lives of women and men,” she told HuffPost Wednesday in New York at Build Series (the interview program is part of Oath, HuffPost’s parent company). “I got the opportunity to be a role model for women and men from all around the world. And I got this opportunity to be a role model to young girls. To me this is a very big honor, but it’s even an even bigger responsibility.”Nel-Peters said she’s ready to take on that responsibility over the next year, especially now that she’s armed with a plan to help empower women. It all stems back to June when she was on her way to an event in her home country. In “broad daylight,” Nel-Peters said, three men carjacked her and held her at gunpoint. “When I got out of the car …they tried shoving me back in the car,” she recalled, saying three guns were pointed directly in her face. “And that’s when I decided that … the second destination would most probably not get better than the first. So, I made a decision there. I took a [self-defense] course before that happened, which taught me how to think and keep a clear mind in a situation like that. And the one thing they told me was if you’re in a life-threatening situation like I was, the throat is a very sensitive place that you can hit and that’s something that can completely put somebody off. So, I punched the guy in the throat as hard as I could and it gave a window of opportunity to run away.” Although she managed to escape, Nel-Peters said she felt the effects of the attack for months. During that time, though, she also felt something else: the need to help other women. “My phone got stolen in the whole carjacking and when I got a new phone and logged on to my Instagram account I got over 2,000 messages from South African women,” she said.The women all asked the same thing: What was the self-defense course you took, and where can I take it? Shortly afterward, Nel-Peters created the Unbreakable campaign, where she teams with self-defense experts to educate and train women in South Africa on how to handle threatening situations, including sexual harassment and assault. “I think violence against women ... is such a big thing that women face all over the world,” she said, adding, “I’ve heard a lot of women sharing their stories with me that they are too ashamed to stand up and talk about it because they feel like they did something wrong. And in reality, they didn’t. A woman should be able to be who and whatever she wants to be and she should be respected for that.”During her one-year reign, Nel-Peters plans to make her Unbreakable campaign a global one, trying to show critics that Miss Universe is more than just a pretty face.

The actor, who portrayed Dothraki warrior Khal Drogo in Season 1, recently paid the cast a visit while in Belfast and got some information about what’s to come in the show. “It’s going to be the greatest thing that’s ever aired on TV,” Momoa told Entertainment Weekly, without revealing any specific details. “It’s going to be unbelievable. It’s going to fuck up a lot of people. And it was a bummer because I’m a huge fan and I didn’t want to know what’s going on. I was like, ’Damn, I didn’t want to know that!”John Bradley, who plays Jon Snow’s friend Sam Tarly, also hyped up the final season in an interview with HuffPost. The actor said every one of the six episodes left will be “monumental.” “I think what we used to call Episode 9 in ‘Game of Thrones’ folklore — the episode when everything comes to a head and you get a lot of spectacular sequences — I think you’re gonna get six ‘Episode 9s’ this year,” Bradley said in early October. “You can tell that because we’ve got directors who have been in charge of some of the most huge set pieces in the past doing episodes all throughout the season.”Bradley added that showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss are set to direct the finale. “It’s in the right hands there,” he said. “They know everything about the show. They’ve been in charge of everything ― every key decision in all seven seasons so far has been made by David and Dan. I think they’ve done an incredible job with this series.

The magazine announced its decision Thursday with Lonnie Ali, Muhammad Ali’s widow, who consults with SI to choose the recipient each year. “Like Muhammad, Colin is a man who stands on his convictions with confidence and courage, undaunted by the personal sacrifices he has had to make to have his message heard,” Ali said in a statement. “He has used his celebrity and philanthropy to benefit some of our most vulnerable community members. I know the Ali family joins me in congratulating Colin as he receives the 2017 SI Muhammad Ali Legacy Award.”Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Jim Brown and Bill Russell were the 2017 co-recipients. In a news release, Executive Editor Stephen Cannella said only a few athletes have “followed [Ali’s] example as fully” as the former San Fransisco quarterback who began kneeling during the pre-game national anthem to protest racial injustice against black people.“In this noisy political and media environment, it’s easy to forget his core message: that all people in this country deserve to be treated with dignity, respect and recognition of their civil rights,” Cannella said. “Too often that message has been lost in the debate over how it is expressed. Colin has sacrificed much in the name of that message, even as he has furthered it with significant charitable efforts that are making a real difference in communities at the grassroots level.”The Legacy Award will be presented at the Sportsperson of the Year Awards on Dec. 5. Kaepernick, who remains unsigned to an NFL team, was also recently honored as GQ’s Citizen of the Year.Since beginning his protest in August 2016, Kaepernick has received criticism from sports leaders and politicians, including President Donald Trump. In the year since beginning his protest, at least 223 black people have been killed by police in this country."

Law and Government includes 28 hours of lectures from Moore and several other speakers. Moore is one of four co-authors listed on the project. “In addition to learning concepts of civil government and public policy, students will be strengthened in their understanding of biblical principles which govern us and which point us to the Lawgiver who governs us all ― Jesus Christ,” Amazon’s summary of the book reads. According to ThinkProgress, the course includes a 2008 lecture from Moore where he discusses his 2003 fight with a federal judge, in which he refused to take down a 5,200-pound statue of the Ten Commandments from the lobby of the Alabama state judicial building. In the lecture, Moore also “bemoans the arrival of marriage equality,” which the California Supreme Court had recently approved, ThinkProgress notes.Another lecture included in the course, titled “What the Bible Says About Female Magistrates,” argues that the Bible does not allow women to hold political office. The lecture, by William Einwechter, a teaching elder at a Pennsylvania church, criticizes the women’s suffrage movement, which won women the right to vote. “By and large, the issue of the female magistrate ruling in authority in America would not have been anywhere near as controversial,” says a second man introducing Einwechter’s lecture, according to ThinkProgress. “The controversy was beginning to brew with the women’s suffrage movement.”“One of the most destructive ideologies of the last 50, hundred years have been the doctrines of feminism, which have transformed our culture and have paved the way for abortion on demand, the homosexual agenda, undermined our church, and subverted the doctrines of the biblical family,” Einwechter later says.Besides Moore, the textbook’s other co-authors are listed as Doug Phillips, Dr. Joseph Morecraft and Dr. Paul Jehle.Phillips, who was the president of Vision Forum, admitted in 2013 to having a “lengthy” extramarital relationship with a woman. The woman, who later sued Phillips and Vision Forum, said Phillips “methodically groomed” her when she was only 15 years old and said he sexually and emotionally abused her for years. Phillips resigned in 2013, and the organization folded in 2014. Phillips’ alleged predatory behavior of sexually pursuing a minor (which sounds similar to the accusations against Moore) is not uncommon in some fundamentalist Christian circles. Vision Forum’s interpretation of biblical patriarchy demonized feminist ideologies and promoted strict gender roles. The idea that there are only two genders and that they are fundamentally separate and different is fairly common among evangelicals. These beliefs underpin the concept of “complementarianism,” the conservative Christian idea that men and women have specific God-given roles.“Central to the crisis of this era is the systematic attack on the timeless truths of biblical patriarchy. This attack includes the movement to subvert the biblical model of the family, and redefine the very meaning of fatherhood and motherhood, masculinity, femininity, and the parent and child relationship,” reads a statement from Vision Forum’s website, available on the Wayback Machine. “Egalitarian feminism is a false ideology that has bred false doctrine in the church and seduced many believers.”Head over to ThinkProgress to read more from their report.

Its members have attacked LGBTQ events, clashed with anti-racist demonstrators and carried out bomb attacks on refugee centers.“In addition to offending and hateful expressions ... the association urges its supporters to use violence and harassment against alleged enemies,” the Finnish court said, according to a Reuters translation of the verdict.Finland’s national police announced they were seeking a ban on the Nordic Resistance Movement in December of last year, after one of the extremist group’s members attacked a 28-year-old Finnish man during a demonstration outside Helsinki’s central train station months before.In the incident, Nordic Resistance Movement member Jesse Torniainen kicked a passerby who spat on the ground in front of the group’s rally in September 2016, causing the man to fall and hit his head on the pavement. The victim died six days after the incident, and Tornianen was found guilty of aggravated violence in December and sentenced to two years in jail.Finland’s National Police Commissioner Seppo Kolehmainen called the Nordic Resistance Movement a “violent and openly racist organization” following Torniainen’s conviction, and announced that authorities would file suit against the group. The new ban on the Nordic Resistance Movement will bar the group from conducting a wide range of activities in Finland including fundraising and holding rallies, according to local media.The group remains legal in other countries in the region, however, and earlier this year one of its marches in Gothenburg, Sweden, resulted in dozens of arrests after it violently clashed with anti-fascist protesters.

Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg warned in August that the country should stop the group from gaining a foothold and influencing the nation’s youth.The group has also attempted to co-opt traditional Norse symbols for use in their propaganda, just as the Nazis did in their iconography, which has sparked counter-demonstrations from Viking enthusiasts.Countries across Europe and North America are still grappling with how to address neo-Nazi and white nationalist groups within their borders. Many of the groups have seen a surge in prominence in recent years as they stir anti-Islam and anti-refugee sentiment.

City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito began the shift in focus when she called for the removal of the Columbus Circle statue because his voyages to the Western Hemisphere had genocidal consequences for Native Americans. Italian-American groups responded that Columbus should be celebrated as a symbol of Italian-American achievements in the United States. At a series of public hearings across the city, and in news coverage, the Columbus debate is overshadowing any real discussion of the heritage of slavery and racism in the United States and New York.Statues honoring James Marion Sims and Samuel Morse in Central Park and Samuel Cox in Tompkins Square Park are going largely ignored. Sims performed experimental gynecological operations on enslaved African women in the American South including over 34 operations on a single woman without the benefit of anesthesia or any type of antiseptic. Many of the women he experimented on died from infection. Morse was an advocate for slavery and an opponent of emancipation. In his diaries he wrote: “Slavery ... is not sin. It is a social condition ordained from the beginning of the world for the wisest purposes, benevolent and disciplinary, by Divine Wisdom.” Cox was one of 56 Congressional representatives who voted against the 13th amendment to end slavery.While people are debating Columbus, they ignore streets in the city named after Andrew Jackson, who was a slaveholder and who committed genocide against native people in the Southeastern United States both before and during his presidency. There are also streets on a military base in Brooklyn named after “Stonewall” Jackson and Robert E. Lee, who fought for the South during the Civil War in defense of slavery.One of the more offensive place names is John Mullaly Park in the Bronx. Mullaly’s call for armed resistance to the military draft led to his arrest following the July 1863 New York City Draft riots. Over one hundred people died and at least nineteen Black men were beaten to death or lynched by rioters in the worst urban unrest in the United States during the 19th century.Even the name New York commemorates a slave trader. James, the Duke of York, was the brother of British King Charles II, and later became King James II. In 1664, his brother granted him control over British North American colonies between the Delaware and Connecticut Rivers and the province and the city of New Amsterdam were renamed after him. James also headed the Royal African Company, which held a royal monopoly over British trade with West Africa, including the slave trade. In the 1680s the Royal African Company forcibly transported about 5,000 enslaved Africans a year to the Americas. Many were branded on their chests with either the letters DY for Duke of York or for the Royal African Company. The British deposed James as King in 1688, but New York province and city kept his name.There is historic precedent in New York City for removing statues of people considered oppressors. During the American Revolution New Yorkers tore down a lead statue of King George III on Bowling Green and melted it to make musket balls.I have mixed feelings about Columbus and the Columbus statue. Columbus certainly was not the first old world mariner to reach the western hemisphere. We know that about 1000 AD Norsemen or Vikings from pre-Christian Scandinavia established settlements in the North Atlantic, including one for a brief time in what is now Newfoundland, Canada. Plausible claims have been made based on ocean currents, botanical evidence, and cryptic textual references for other trans-oceanic voyagers, including Andalusian Arabs from Spain, West Africans, and Polynesians. Legends from a variety of cultures have been used to make the case for trans-oceanic travelers to the New World from China, India, Japan, and an Irish monk known as Saint Brendan who supposedly crossed the Atlantic in the sixth century.I especially like the possibility that West African fishermen, blown out to sea by a storm, could have been caught in South Atlantic currents that carried them to South America.

No images survive from his lifetime. Columbus died in 1506.

Natives were enslaved and tortured to force them to hand over non-existing gold. Treatment of the native population of the Americas was documented by Dominican friar Bartolomé de las Casas, one of the early European settlers in the Western Hemisphere, in his book “A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies.” De las Casas managed an estate in the Spanish colonies from 1502 to 1507 before entering the priesthood.On the other hand, the Columbian voyages, lead to a series of exchanges between the Eastern and Western hemispheres that transformed the world.

John Conyers (D-Mich.) shot down calls for the congressman to resign amid sexual harassment allegations and instead pointed fingers at the accusers during a news conference on Thursday.Attorney Arnold Reed, who spoke outside of Conyers’ home after the 88-year-old was hospitalized for a stress-related illness, in particular questioned the claims brought by Conyers’ former deputy chief of staff, Marion Brown.“She had an opportunity 15 years ago to come out and she didn’t but she is jumping on the bandwagon now?” Reed said of Brown, who has accused Conyers of sexual harassment while serving in the role from 2003 to 2014.Reed, in particular, questioned the timing of her and other accusers’ allegations against Conyers as well as a monetary settlement that Brown received after working for him.“Suing her for defamation is not anything at this juncture that would accomplish anything, except give it further forum as to why it is she took the money and stayed on with the congressman for 11 years,” he said.Reed said that despite increasing calls from members of Congress for Conyers to resign, he won’t be doing it Thursday or Friday.“Right now the congressman’s health is the big issue here,” Reed said, while brushing off one such request from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-N.Y.) on Thursday.“She sure as hell won’t be the one to tell the congressman to leave,” he said. “Individuals like the congressman have a right to due process and a right to defend themselves.”“At the end of the day, the congressman will rise and fall on his own merits,” he said.Reed went on to express displeasure that Conyers is being asked to resign while Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.), who has been accused of sexual misconduct in recent weeks, isn’t.“I would suspect that Nancy Pelosi is going to have to explain what is the discernible difference between Al Franken and John Conyers? That is a question that she is going to have to answer.”News of Conyers’ hospitalization came the same morning that Brown publicly spoke out about her allegations against him.“Some of the things that he did ― it was sexual harassment, violating my body ... propositioning me for sex,” she said on NBC’s “Today” show. “He has touched me in different ways and it was very uncomfortable and very unprofessional.”Brown filed a complaint against Conyers in 2014 and the next year agreed to a settlement that included a nondisclosure agreement. She said she decided to break that agreement on Thursday “to stand up for all the women in the workforce that are voiceless.”Deanna Maher, his former deputy chief of staff in the late 1990s, has also accused Conyers of inappropriately touching her and asking to have sex with her.Several members of Congress have called on Conyers to resign in light of the allegations, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.).Reed told HuffPost, “Nancy Pelosi can say what she wants to say,” but Conyers will be the one to decide whether he stays in Congress.“That decision is not Nancy Pelosi’s to make. What she needs to do is be able to explain, when and if it comes to it, that [Minnesota Sen.] Al Franken’s got, I believe four accusers, and at least one photo,” Reed said. “What’s the discernible difference between John Conyers and Al Franken? She’s going to have to explain that.”Conyers on Sunday announced that he was stepping down as ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee while the House Ethics Committee investigates the allegations.This story has been updated with quotes from Conyers’ attorney."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a200d0a150000016485aa65.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"James Cameron, director of plenty of films other than “Titanic,” is still fielding questions about the hit 1997 movie.In a recent interview with Vanity Fair, Cameron explained why Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) had to die at the end of the film. He also told why Rose (Kate Winslet) didn’t make room for Jack on the board she was floating on.“The answer is very simple because it says on page 147 [of the script] that Jack dies. Very simple,” the director said, using a throwaway line he’s said before. “Obviously it was an artistic choice, the thing was just big enough to hold her, and not big enough to hold him,” Cameron said. “Had he lived, the ending of the film would have been meaningless,” he said. “The film is about death and separation; he had to die. So whether it was that, or whether a smoke stack fell on him, he was going down. It’s called art, things happen for artistic reasons, not for physics reasons.” Earlier this year, Cameron told The Daily Beast that he disagrees with a viral photo that showed both Jack and Rose could have fit on the board together: He also shot down a theory from an episode of “Mythbusters” in which hosts Jamie Hyneman and Adam Savage said Jack could’ve lived by tying his and Rose’s lifejackets to the bottom of the plank.Nope, not happening, said Cameron: OK, so let’s really play that out: you’re Jack, you’re in water that’s 28 degrees, your brain is starting to get hypothermia. Mythbusters asks you to now go take off your life vest, take hers off, swim underneath this thing, attach it in some way that it won’t just wash out two minutes later—which means you’re underwater tying this thing on in 28-degree water, and that’s going to take you five to ten minutes, so by the time you come back up you’re already dead. So that wouldn’t work. His best choice was to keep his upper body out of the water and hope to get pulled out by a boat or something before he died.Kate Winslet confessed that even she thinks Jack could have been saved at the end of the film.“You know, I think he could have actually fit on that bit of door,” the actress told Jimmy Kimmel in 2016. If only she could have moved over. "

One moment the multi-faceted America’s Got Talent finalist is detailing the sexual empowerment of new single “Wild Side.” The next, he’s baby-talking Pepper, the five-pound, mix-breed love-of-his-life.“I wish you could see my dog right now; she’s being so cute,” the out singer gushed during an appearance on Party Foul Radio with Pollo & Pearl. “She looks like Splinter from Ninja Turtles.”In many ways, it seems only fitting Crum should temporarily table discussion of “Wild Side,” his slinky new track released to online retailers and YouTube Nov. 15. A self-described “freak” when it comes to pooches, especially his tiny Chihuahua/terrier mix, it’s a reminder why he proved so lovable on America’s Got Talent.“If I see a dog on the street, I have to stop and say hi; I have to have a moment,” admitted Crum. “I have this very specific dog voice. It’s a whole thing, and people judge me, but I don’t care...”“I love the doggies,” he says, instantly upping the pitch on his multi-octave voice to speak directly to Pepper. “Yes, I do!”Being utterly adorable is only one reason Crum faired so well on the hit NBC competition series’ eleventh season. He impressed both fans and judges– including notorious curmudgeon Simon Cowell – with soaring renditions of Queen’s “Somebody to Love,” Radiohead’s “Creep” and even Phil Collins classic “In the Air Tonight.” His story of being bullied upon coming out (in elementary school no less!) further solidified his role as an audience favorite. Though “very happy” to tell his story on national television en route to a fourth-place finish, Crum is quick to stress he’s “not a victim.” “I don’t live in that place of victimhood,” insisted the singer. A desire to reinforce he is not a “woe-is-me kind of guy,” he told Podomatic’s No. 1 LGBTQ podcast, has shaped his musical direction going forward.“Something that was super important to me was for people to see me take my power,” said Crum of “Wild Side.” “A lot of my power comes from sex. I’m very sexual. Why wouldn’t I be proud of that?”LISTEN: Brian Justin Crum Talks Sex, New Single “Wild Side,” Frankmusik For “Wild Side,” Crum partnered with music producer Frankmusik. The duo collaborated on the synth-heavy pop track, which (perhaps not-surprisingly) bears strong sonic similarities to recent work by Adam Lambert. The video intersperses current images of Crum and archival footage of the queer conversion therapy practices of yesteryear. It’s a reminder of “how far we have come from the archaic times when LGBTQ were sent to mental hospitals and psychiatric wards to find a cure for their ‘sickness,’” the artist said – and how far we still have to go.“We, as LGBTQ people, are told from the time we’re very young that sexuality is something to be ashamed of,” said Crum. “I want to show people out there it’s nothing to be shameful for, that we should be proud and celebrate. Sex between consenting adults is a beautiful thing.”According to Crum, “Wild Side” is an accurate preview of what’s ahead musically. “In it’s production and the dark, seedy kind of feel, absolutely, there is a through line of that,” he said of a pending full-length release. That’s due in large part, he suggested, to working with Frankmusik.“He gets my voice; I get his style,” he said of the producer, “We’ve come up with some really dope stuff I’m excited to share with everybody.”After “super randomly” connecting with Frankmusik, who helmed Erasure’s 2011 album Tomorrow’s World and is featured on two RuPaul albums, Crum said the pair “vibed” in the studio. To date, they have finalized five tracks.WATCH: Brian Justin Crum “Wild Side”“It almost feels like a lot of our songs are duets, because his style is so him,” acknowledged Crum of Frankmusik. “The music is just dripping with sex and angst,” he continued. “I love that we have this kind of ‘package’ thing coming out, where we both put our art and soul into it and want it to tell a story.”Though revealing himself in such intimate ways to audiences who only know him from AGT is “absolutely scary,” Crum says the thought’s also “rewarding.” Describing his upcoming album as “a diary almost,” it provides fans a peek into the “wide range of feelings and emotions” he’s known since leaving the show.“I can look back at these songs I’ve written over the past year and remember specific moments with ex-lovers or moments of feeling empowered by breaking up with somebody,” stated the San Diego resident, who is “excited” to share those experiences with listeners. “It’s cool that you’ll see this journey I’ve been on this past year,” concluded Crum. “It’s definitely sexy, it’s definitely a little dark, but that’s who I am, and I want to show all those sides.”Follow Brian Justin Crum on Twitter.Follow Party Foul Radio on Twitter.“Like” Party Foul Radio on Facebook.LISTEN: Brian Justin Crum’s Interview on Podomatic’s No. 1 LGBT Podcast"

The Los Angeles-based Allred is representing several women who have accused well-known men of sexual assault over the last two months.“The filmmakers did notify us that they were going to continue shooting to add to the documentary as all of the allegations” continue to emerge, the festival’s director of programming, Trevor Groth, told The Hollywood Reporter. “So, there is a real sort of timely quality to that film.”Netflix is distributing the film.Allred has a history of representing accusers in sexual misconduct cases, including women who came forward against President Donald Trump and comedian Bill Cosby.One of her current clients is Beverly Young Nelson, one of the nearly 10 women who have accused Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore of preying on them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. Moore has denied the allegations.Allred also is working with several of the actresses and former employees who have accused Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein of sexual harassment and assault.“I feel fortunate that ‘Seeing Allred’ captures my passion and battle for justice for many victims of injustice,” Allred said in a statement. “The courage that my clients demonstrate, in speaking truth to power, inspires me every day as we fight together.”According to Netflix, the film will feature interviews with feminist icon Gloria Steinem, CNN host Don Lemon, and Allred’s daughter Lisa Bloom, herself an attorney. Although Bloom also is known for representing victims of sexual abuse, she was advising Weinstein when the allegations of his predatory actions toward women first surfaced in early October. Bloom has since severed her ties with Weinstein.After its premiere, “Seeing Allred” will become available for streaming on Netflix in early 2018. "

The singer-songwriter wrote an essay published in Time on Thursday as part of the magazine’s partnership with Sheryl Sandberg’s mental health initiative, #OptionBThere. In the piece, Kesha discussed how the holidays often throw people out of their routines and can set them back emotionally. “When you have a routine, it’s easier to manage whatever mental struggles you may be faced with, and when that routine is broken, it can trigger things you may not be ready to face,” she wrote. “I know it has for me. It was during the holidays when I hit a low moment and with the help of my mother decided to seek help for my eating disorder.”She gave a few tips to ease the inevitable anxiety: Take a walk, talk to a friend, don’t be afraid to take some personal time away from family or download a meditation app. Kesha’s personal mantra? “It’s not selfish to take time for yourself,” she wrote.“It’s not your responsibility to try to make the whole world happy. Especially since sometimes it’s not that easy to make yourself happy, either ― even with all the celebrations and gifts and seasonal decorations, foods and drinks, which can only do so much,” she wrote. “So don’t ask yourself things like ‘It’s almost Christmas, why am I not happy?’ That can turn into a shame cycle. It’s just another day — don’t put unrealistic expectations on it, and don’t beat yourself up.”"

But an inaccurate count could have severe consequences, especially for people of color.",2017-11-30,"Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversees the census, speaks at an event in London. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a2049ab150000d97685abfb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The U.S. Census Bureau is significantly scaling back its preparations for the 2020 census, which experts say could compromise the agency’s ability to accurately conduct its constitutionally mandated count of people.An inaccurate census could have drastic consequences, with the potential to hit minority communities the hardest. The survey, which the Constitution requires take place every 10 years, helps allocate hundreds of billions of federal dollars to state and local governments, according to the Census Project, a group that tracks the census. The survey data is also used to draw electoral districts, because each district is legally required to have roughly the same number of people.Census officials initially planned to do three dress rehearsals of the census ahead of 2020, but cut two of those tests because of a funding shortfall. Experts also note that members of minority communities may be hesitant to give personal information to the government, and that the bureau currently doesn’t have enough partnership specialists in place to begin to build their trust.The bureau has been hampered by budget issues ― specifically, a congressional mandate that it cannot spend more on the 2020 census than it did in 2010. This is the first time in modern history that the bureau has faced such a cap, said Terri Ann Lowenthal, a census consultant who worked as staff director of the House census oversight subcommittee from 1987 to 1994. The bureau has also faced a shortfall of a little over $200 million since 2012, said John Thompson, who served as the director of the Census Bureau from 2013 until he abruptly resigned in May. This has resulted in the agency prioritizing certain crucial technological and automation upgrades, Thompson told HuffPost. It has also resulted in the bureau putting less money behind advertising and local partnerships that do long-term work in communities and encourage people to respond to the census.“That’s the only way you’re going to get local communities, local individuals to understand why it’s important to answer the census [and] that the information is confidential,” Thompson said. “That message has to come out locally, from trusted voices. That can’t come from Washington.”The bureau planned to have 800 partnership specialists for the 2010 census and got funding for an additional 3,000 in the stimulus bill, according to Lowenthal. She said Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversees the census, has indicated that the bureau wants to hire 1,000 specialists for the 2020 survey. However, Lowenthal said the bureau has requested funding for only 43 such specialists, and that she thought there needed to be at least five times as many in place by next year.Such lack of trust could particularly hurt communities of color, which experts say are already harder to count during the census. And President Donald Trump is making the situation even worse.Lowenthal said immigrants, anxious about Trump’s deportation threats, might be more hesitant to respond to the survey. People who live in communities where there are increased tensions with the police also might not want to give the government their personal information, she added. Arturo Vargas, the executive director of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials Educational Fund, told HuffPost that the White House was making it more difficult to convince people to fill out the census.“People actively fear their own government because of the type of rhetoric we heard throughout the campaign and in the past year,” Vargas said. “One of the bureau’s major tasks is to assure the public that participating in the census is strictly confidential, but the government is undermining themselves.”“On the one hand, you have the Census Bureau doing this PR campaign telling everybody it’s OK to participate, and you have personalities in our White House talking about deportation forces and Muslim bans and so forth,” he said. “It’s creating a hostile environment.”The Census Bureau did not respond to a request for comment.Getting an accurate census count of minority populations is crucial to making sure they receive adequate federal assistance and have a voice in government. Lawmakers are prohibited from drawing electoral maps that intentionally dilute the impact of minority votes, and census data can be used to challenge maps that violate that guideline.Advocates are also concerned that the Census Bureau is going to use new methods of gathering data in 2020 without adequate testing in the field. Tests conducted exactly two years before the actual census require a massive effort to organize, and planning for them typically takes about six months, said Phil Sparks, co-director of the Census Project. The bureau initially planned to test 700,000 households in West Virginia, Washington state and Rhode Island next year, but canceled the West Virginia and Washington tests because of budget issues.Those cancellations are particularly alarming, Sparks said, because the Census Bureau plans to use the internet and other technology for the first time in 2020. Online surveys are more efficient and cost-effective than paper mailers, Sparks said, but the method needs to be tested for bugs before it’s used in an official capacity. The bureau is also planning to introduce an option that would allow people to call in to a center to respond to the initial census questionnaire.Lowenthal noted the canceled tests would make it more difficult for the Census Bureau to try out new methods in rural areas and other places less likely to have internet access and other infrastructure required to support a high-tech survey.“Internet response saves money, as Congress hopes it will. But the people who are more likely to respond by internet already are easier to count, historically, already are more likely to participate, voluntarily. Communities that are historically considered harder to count accurately, people of color, immigrants, low-income households, are also disproportionately on the wrong side of the digital divide,” she said. “It is very risky to go into a census using methods that have not been fully vetted in the field.” Thompson said the bureau plans to use geospatial technology to map some areas instead of sending out canvassers. The canvassers who do go into the field will be able to use mobile technology that makes it easier to record data when they follow up with people who fail to respond to the initial survey.“This is Obamacare sign-up times five,” Sparks said. “It relies totally on technology and techniques that the Census Bureau has not used before. So the fact that two of the three major field tests that they’re not going to use are now not in play means they’re going to go into the 2020 census without testing major components in hard-to-count areas.”The bureau is supposed to test 43 technology systems in 2018, The Los Angeles Times reported in October. At that time, just four had been completely developed and 21 were functional to some degree.Funding a strong census requires planning and budgeting over 10 years ― something Congress, often looking for immediate fixes, doesn’t do very well, Lowenthal said. Ross, the commerce secretary, asked Congress for an additional $3.3 billion for the census in October. But some Democrats suggested that could still be too low.“If you repeated the amount of money that the last census cost in 2020, estimates said it was gonna cost over $17 billion, which led the Census Bureau to say, ‘Look, if you give us the resources now, you invest in our planning, we can do the census for the $12.7 billion,’” said Thompson, the former Census Bureau director. There are also lingering questions about the bureau’s leadership. An acting director and deputy director are currently filling the bureau’s top two posts, and the role of top officials will become even more crucial as the actual survey approaches. Advocates were alarmed when the White House indicated last week that Thomas Brunell, a political science professor with strong views on gerrymandering and no management experience, might be tapped for the deputy director job. The business of counting Americans isn’t glamorous, Lowenthal said. But she said that doing it well was crucial to ensuring the guarantees of the Constitution.“A successful census is one that counts all communities equally well. That matters because there is a guarantee in the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of equal representation in all electoral districts based on population and the number of people who live in every community,” she said. “The undercount, the disproportionate of certain population groups deprives those communities of their rightful share of equal representation and influence in the process of governing.”"
73,POLITICS,"Republicans Insist Tax Cuts Will Benefit Workers, But CEOs Have Other Plans",Igor Bobic and Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/corporate-tax-cuts-gop_us_5a203b78e4b0392a4ebc1685,GOP lawmakers are placing faith in corporations to do “the right thing.”,2017-11-30,"U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin poses with his wife, Louise Linton, while holding an uncut sheet of $1 dollar notes bearing Mnuchin's name. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a203dad140000bc43b6aaec.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Republicans insist their tax cut bill will benefit workers, though the legislation has few provisions that directly benefit people with modest incomes in the long run.Instead, the core of the bill is a huge cut to corporate taxes, bringing the top rate down from 35 to 20 percent. Republicans say workers will be better off if corporate executives and shareholders have more money.“If they’re making money, they invest that money, they create more opportunities, more jobs, more research,” Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) told HuffPost.A number of top CEOs, however, have signaled they plan to reward their investors instead.Instead of hiring more workers or increasing wages, executives from major companies including Cisco Systems, Pfizer, Coca-Cola, Amgen and Honeywell have said they plan to use the windfall from the corporate tax cut to first increase stock dividends or to buy back shares.“We’ll be able to get much more aggressive on the share buyback” after the tax cut is passed into law, Cisco CFO Kelly Kramer said in an earnings call earlier this month. Stock buybacks increase the value of shares held by investors ― a group that typically includes corporate executives, who are among the corporate tax cut’s biggest proponents.The intentions of corporate executives have appeared to baffle White House officials. When Gary Cohn, Trump’s chief economic adviser, asked a gathering of CEOs earlier this month to raise their hands if they planned to boost investment if rates were cut, he got a lukewarm response.“Why aren’t the other hands up?” Cohn asked awkwardly after only a few of the business leaders raised their arms into the air.But Republican senators on Wednesday maintained their firm belief that corporations would ultimately reinvest their gains into their workers. None expressed concerns about CEOs using tax cut gains to simply reward their investors.“This is America,” Sen. Jim Risch (R-Idaho) told HuffPost. “The money belongs to people who have it in their pockets and they should do with it what they think is appropriate. It can help, however, to foster higher wages, because if [corporations] got more money then particularly in the climate we’re in with the shortage of employees, wages are definitely going to go up.”Cutting the corporate tax rate is “something that will drive investment,” argued Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), a wealthy former real estate developer. “I believe that with all my heart. I was a business guy most of my life and know those things affect behavior.”Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) said he was not concerned by the prospect of CEOs enriching investors over their workers. Asked by HuffPost as to why not, Kennedy responded “because I’m not” and walked into a Senate elevator.Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who voted to advance the GOP tax cut bill this week, said she would be disappointed if corporations do not reinvest their gains into their workers.“The purpose of lowering the corporate rate to encourage job creation here,” Collins told HuffPost at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast on Thursday. “It is not to encourage stock buybacks, which tend to enrich the executives of a firm. So that would be disappointing if that was the case.”While the tax reform legislation moving through Congress clearly benefits businesses, the effects of its changes to individual income taxes are more muddled. The basic plan is to reduce income tax rates across the board and to simplify the tax code by eliminating a vast swath of deductions that reduce the amount of income subject to tax. While deductions generally favor wealthier households, some tax filers of more modest means lose out in the tradeoff between lower rates and higher taxable incomes. And to reduce the bill’s theoretical cost in order to comply with Senate rules, almost all of the changes to the individual income tax in the Senate version of the legislation expire at the end of 2025, while a provision that slows annual increases in tax bracket levels would be permanent (as would the business cuts). The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center found that 9 percent of taxpayers would have a higher bill in 2019 and fully 50 percent would pay more in 2027 after the individual cuts expire.While the GOP has opted for a bill providing a corporate tax windfall in the hope that those gains will be passed on to workers down the road, it’s not as if there’s no way to make specific tax changes now that directly benefit workers. Republicans could have proposed a reduction in the federal payroll taxes taken out of every paycheck ― something Congress actually did from 2011 to 2013, instantly boosting everyone’s pay by 2 percent for that two-year period. Republicans also could have proposed expanding eligibility for the earned income tax credit, which reduces tax liability and provides an annual refund check for 28 million households.Instead, a temporary expansion to the child tax credit seems mostly designed to offset the impact of repealing the deduction for personal exemptions, which is currently a massive benefit to families with children. For now, though, Republicans are placing faith in corporations to do what some have already said they might not.“I hope they’ll do the right thing. What we want corporate America to do is what the smaller companies do,” Shelby said. “I believe a lot of that will go on, rather than buybacks and stuff like that. I hope that’s what will happen. We have to work the high road, and hope they do that. Some won’t, but I think a majority of the people will invest in the future and grow the economy.”"

76,QUEER VOICES,American Found Naked And Dead In Australia In 1988 Was Killed In Gay Hate Crime: Coroner,Carla Herreria,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/scott-johnson-death-ruled-gay-hate-crime_us_5a1f4cf0e4b037b8ea1f8762,"Scott Johnson's murder happened at a time when gay men were being hunted, assaulted and, sometimes, killed.",2017-11-30,A coroner found that Scott Johnson was killed at a time when violent anti-gay gangs visited places where men met to engage in sex.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a1f8259140000ce2eb6a8a8.jpeg?cache=IWoRdWiVmQ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Scott Johnson, the 27-year-old American who was found naked and dead at the bottom of a cliff in Australia nearly 30 years ago, was likely killed for being gay, a state coroner announced Thursday. In an inquest into Johnson’s death ― the third inquest of its kind ― Coroner Michael Barnes criticized prior police investigations for rushing to rule the death a suicide.Barnes’s findings, released to the public Thursday, offer some closure to a decades-long mystery about what happened to Johnson, a promising mathematician who was in Australia studying for his doctorate. During an earlier investigation, police had incorrectly suggested that the clifftop area above where Johnson was found dead was not a gay beat ― a meeting place for gay men to have casual sex ― when it in fact was.At the time of Johnson’s death, it was common for groups of men in Sydney to go to these known spots at coastal cliffs, hunting for gay men to assault, rob and, at times, kill, Barnes wrote in his findings. The assailants would sometimes force the gay men off cliffs, The New York Times reported in January in an article about dozens of deaths being reviewed. “Some of these assaults resulted in death of the victims and in some of the assaults the victims were robbed,” Barnes wrote, adding “some of the soldiers housed at an army barracks a short walk from the beat where Scott died engaged” in these types of attacks, too.Fishermen found Johnson’s body at the bottom of a nearly 200-foot cliff at North Head in Manly, New South Wales, on Dec. 10, 1988. His clothes were neatly folded at the top of the cliff. There was no suicide note.The coroner at the time had originally ruled Johnson’s death a suicide following the first inquest, but Johnson’s brother didn’t believe it.Steve Johnson, a wealthy tech entrepreneur, had suspected his brother was pushed or scared off the cliff. He spent about $1 million of his own money to fund a 12-year private investigation into his brother’s death, according to The Australian.Steve Johnson’s efforts to uncover the truth surrounding his brother’s death led to a second inquest into the case, which ended in 2012 with an open verdict due to the lack of evidence.The final inquest into Johnson’s death is only the second time in Australian history that investigators have opened a third inquest into a single case, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.Earlier this year, New South Wales police launched a review into the deaths of 88 men from 1976 to 2000 in an attempt to determine whether the deaths should be reclassified as gay hate crimes, The New York Times reported in January. In about a dozen of the cases, police said the victims’ bodies were found below cliffs or in the ocean.Former Australian officials and police officers told the Times that some police in the 1980s and 1990s were known to be hostile toward gay men and carried out investigations that ruled out the possibility of homicide. “We can now see that predators were attacking gay men,” Ted Pickering, the former police minister for New South Wales in the late 1980s, told the Times. “And they were doing it with the almost-certain knowledge that the police would not have gone after them. That was the police culture of the day.”Although Barnes’ findings said there was insufficient evidence to identify Johnson’s perpetrators, Steve Johnson made a call for his brother’s killers to come clean.“Scott’s killers are probably alive. Their friends know who they are,” Steve Johnson told news reporters after the coroner’s findings were announced, according to The Australian. “I wish they would come forward.”The ruling on Johnson’s death comes at a time when the LGBTQ community is celebrating lawmakers’ historic vote to pass a bill legalizing same-sex marriage in the country. The bill, which is on its way to the House of Representatives, where it is also expected to pass, marks a triumphant turning point for LGBTQ individuals in Australia. In his findings, Barnes acknowledged that Johnson’s potential was cut short by the hate crime.The coroner wrote: “When Scott Johnson’s body smashed into the rocks near the ocean just north of Blue Fish Point on North Head, a life full of promise and exciting potential was tragically cut short and his family lost a cherished member.”"

In fact, a friend of mine recently told me that H&M is even selling t-shirts that say “Feminist” on them. You can look on the bright side and think that maybe that’s a good thing and that women are finally getting over the stigma that has surrounded the “F” word for so long, or you can cringe at the commodification of feminism, a school of thought that, when it’s done right, consistently critiques capitalism.But something is definitely happening. In fact, some claim that we’re in a “fourth wave” of feminism, one which aims to put into practice the inclusivity and intersectionality proposed in the third wave and which distinguishes itself by the use of new technologies, particularly the internet and social media. While these new tools have provided women with innovative ways of connecting and showing solidarity with each other across physical boundaries and have opened up new spaces in which we can talk openly about the challenges of being a woman and effect political change, they’ve also come with challenges. Social media platforms such as Facebook have modified their algorithms so that our newsfeeds are pretty much echo chambers where we just talk to those who we already agree with and are fed only the information and articles that interest us or affirm our already well-held beliefs. Not only that, but Facebook is still riddled with disturbing sexist and racist hate groups, which despite being reported, are often still allowed to stay active. It’s no surprise that this is the case when you see that most of those working in leadership positions at Facebook are white men. According to Facebook’s own figures released in 2015, men made up 68% of all employees, 77% of those in senior leadership and 85% of those working in technology. Now, that’s not to say that all these men are sympathetic to these groups, but rather that their privilege protects them from feeling genuinely under threat or attacked by their existence, and perhaps this is why removing these platforms of hate would appear to have slipped down on their list of priorities.And when we do manage to speak outside of our own circles on the internet, women are often on the receiving end of harassment, abuse and even death threats. Just as in any public space, there are men that will try anything to silence women. A recent survey carried out by digital security firm Norton found that nearly half of the 1,000 respondents had experienced some form of abuse or harassment online. Among women under 30, the incidence was 76%. And then there are the darker parts of the internet, for example the 40,000 strong “Incel” (involuntarily celibate) “support group” on Reddit, in which men discussed how much they hate women for “withholding” sex from them. This forum was recently shut down because it was basically a cesspool of hate speech where members often condoned rape and wrote such colourfully titled posts such as “All Women are Sluts”. The existence of such unbridled misogyny is truly a worrying barometer of how much hate there is out there for women.People like to dismiss such groups as the lunatic fringe, or dismiss online harassment as harmless because, after all, it’s “just the internet”. People like to think of the internet as somehow outside of “real life”, when the reality is that it’s an essential part of it, becoming ever more ingrained into our everyday lives and psyches. Harassment online is harassment and it mirrors the everyday harassment of women offline. While the current revelations about widespread sexual abuse and harassment against women and LGBTQ folk in the film industry may be shocking to some, it isn’t shocking to me, or to many women I know. Actors and comedians who, like wolves in sheep’s clothing, even made themselves out to be feminists themselves, have been exposed as abusers and harassers. It’s truly baffling, and yet sadly not surprising at all. One wonders how these men have been so oblivious to their own behaviour, claiming in some cases not to even remember the incidents themselves. Why is that? Is it because being an abuser is so natural to them, that they don’t even register these events as noteworthy? Are they so ignorant about relationships with others that they don’t know what sexual harassment or abuse is? Do they really not know what consent means? Or is it because they don’t fit the bill of the typical villain, you know, they weren’t wearing a cape and cackling wildly as they carried out the deeds, so how could they have done something wrong? How could they be the bad guy?Sometimes it’s genuinely hard to even imagine a future where women are treated equally and can feel safe, especially when we consider how common sexual harassment is. A Cornell University study carried out in 2014 in collaboration with Hollaback!, an anti-harassment NGO, shows that 81.5% of European women have been harassed in one shape or form by the age of 17. 64% of Irish women reported being groped or fondled in 2014 alone, while 80% of German women admitted taking another route to their home or another destination because of the fear of being harassed. I would argue that every woman has experienced some form of sexual harassment. And yet so many well-meaning men that I know express shock when I discuss how common these experiences are. So many men we know and love appear to be utterly blind to the behaviour of other men, some of whom they must know. It’s an everyday reality for women, but it shouldn’t be, and yet ironically some men are now claiming it’s a “dangerous time to be a man”—well welcome to the club, lads. They whine and throw their toys out of the pram, dubbing this wave of harassment allegations in Hollywood as “a witch hunt”. I couldn’t disagree more. After all, calling it a witch hunt would imply that these men are innocent and being wrongly accused, and in my opinion, it’s an offense to witches everywhere to be lumped in with these cretins.I’m glad they’re being exposed and I’m glad their victims are finding strength in numbers and coming forward. If we treat these incidents in Hollywood as a microcosm of the system in which we live, then I hope that it sets a new precedent where victims, famous or not, feel they can come forward and out their harassers. The #metoo social media campaign, which grew out of the news about Harvey Weinstein sexually assaulting numerous women, sparked an online conversation about how widespread and common harassment and abuse is for women. Scrolling through my newsfeed I wasn’t even remotely shocked, rather I was more surprised at the sheer volume of women who actually openly engaged in the conversation, women who in the past would have maybe even made fun of me for being a feminist, and that to me, was some progress. It gives us a gleam of hope that people feel like they can now come forward and talk about what happened to them, recognise it as a systematic problem and be listened to.Contrary to what some men may think, a feminist future is not some sort of dystopian one where all men should be afraid, but one where all men are aware of their sexist blind-spots, where harassers and abusers face the consequences for their actions, and where all women feel safe both in the private and public realms because they’re finally treated as equals.Previously published as ‘Towards a Feminist Future’ in Lorna’s ROAR column in The Wild Word magazine. www.thewildword.comFor more great Wild Word essays:Why This Is Our “Women’s Lives Matter” Moment by Maria BehanHow To Transform Your Relationship With Money To Plan For The Future by Hadassah DamienWhere Are Our Female Role Models of Work-Life Balance? by Annie Mark-Westfall"
78,POLITICS,How The Federal Reserve Could Rain On Trump's Tax Cut Parade,Arthur Delaney and Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-federal-reserve-offset-tax-cuts_us_5a2076cae4b03350e0b55f99,"Even if the tax cuts boost growth, the central bank could slam the brakes.",2017-11-30,"Jerome Powell, President Donald Trump's nominee to become Federal Reserve chairman, testifies before the Senate Banking Committee on Nov. 28, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a2077161900003a00033c7a.jpeg?cache=5hqivrgBNZ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Republicans say their tax overhaul bill will juice the economy, and most economists agree that cutting corporate taxes could boost growth, at least in the short term.But one reason the boost won’t be as strong as Republicans might like is that the Federal Reserve would be expected to move to keep that growth in check. Mark Zandi, chief economist with Moody’s economy.com, said that if massive tax cuts aren’t offset with correspondingly large tax increases or reductions in government spending, the Fed’s response could even cause the economy to contract. “If the tax cuts are deficit financed, that is going to juice the economy and it will overheat, significantly raising the odds of a recession early in the next decade,” Zandi told HuffPost. With the national unemployment rate at or beneath 5 percent for the past two years, many economists consider the economy at or approaching “full employment” ― the lowest amount of unemployment possible without spurring higher-than-ideal inflation. In other words, unemployment is low, but not so low that labor scarcity gives workers enough leverage to drive up wages so dramatically that it prompts runaway inflation.The Fed has a dual mandate to maximize employment and keep the rate of price growth stable, pursuing the latter goal by targeting a 2 percent inflation rate. If inflation show signs of exceeding the 2 percent threshold, the Fed could hit the brakes by raising an influential interest rate. An increase in the benchmark federal funds rate ― the rate banks charge one another for overnight lending ― would dampen economic growth by raising the cost of credit throughout the economy.Depending on how fast the Fed decides to raise the benchmark rate, the short-term benefits of the tax cuts could disappear ― or as Zandi fears, prematurely initiate an economic “bust” cycle, or downturn.Several prominent assessments of the Republican tax cuts likewise anticipate that a counter-response from the Fed would limit the gains from them ― even if they don’t quite share Zandi’s level of concern. The Joint Committee on Taxation, a panel that analyzes tax legislation for Congress, said in a report Thursday that the Senate version of the bill would increase growth by just 0.8 percent, an estimate roughly in line with other analyses. “The monetary policy response function used in this analysis assumes that the Fed will act aggressively to counteract any demand stimulus resulting from the proposal because the economy is expected to be operating near full employment,” the JCT said. In a report on the House version of the legislation, the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center also said the Fed’s response would dampen the bill’s impact. “Interest rates are projected to rise in the short run because the legislation would boost aggregate demand and output, leading the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates to avoid a surge in inflation,” the TPC said. A key point of contention is whether and how much the tax cuts sought by President Donald Trump will actually boost economic growth to such a degree that inflation will pick up enough to prompt the Fed to act. Zandi is on one end of the spectrum, warning that the tax cuts would both significantly stimulate the economy and do so at a time when that would be unhealthy. But others are far from certain that the tax cuts will even prompt enough growth to elicit a response from the Fed.The Republican tax cuts are due to cost $1.4 trillion over a 10-year period, according an estimate by the Joint Committee on Taxation. Absent accompanying spending cuts or tax increases, those cuts would be paid for through borrowing and add to the national debt.The $1.4 trillion sounds like a lot of money ― and in lean times, it would probably have a greater impact.But in today’s economy, it is a relative drop in the bucket. Even assuming the cuts are deficit-financed and every last dollar cycles back into the economy through consumer spending, the law would pour $140 billion a year into the American economy on average over 10 years ― an amount equivalent to just under three-quarters of a percentage point of the current gross domestic product of $19.5 trillion.Many of the wealthy individuals who receive a tax cut, though, will not spend more money, so it is likely that merely half of the tax cuts will go back into the economy, said Joseph Gagnon, a former Federal Reserve economist who is now a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.As a result, Trump’s tax cuts increase the chance that interest rates will rise sooner, but “not by a huge amount,” Gagnon said.For example, the Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee, the panel responsible for adjusting interest rates, could decide to raise the federal funds rate four times between now and the end of 2018 instead of the currently expected three times, Gagnon said.Whether the tax cuts generate so much growth that it prompts push-back from the Fed, or they merely fall short of the rosy expectations projected by GOP lawmakers, Republicans should brace themselves for disappointment, he said.“The tax cuts are not gonna boost the economy as much as Republicans hope ― in part because I don’t believe in the long-run growth effects that some believe will occur, and in part, because the Fed may raise rates a little faster,” Gagnon said.Andrew Levin, a former Federal Reserve economist who now teaches at Dartmouth College, was more optimistic that the economy has room to grow before inflation would become a concern for Fed officials, including chairman-designate Jerome Powell.Even nine years after the 2008 financial crisis, inflation continues to undershoot the Fed’s 2 percent target, Levin noted. An inflation measure that filters out the more volatile prices of food and energy grew at a rate of 1.4 percent in the 12-month period ending in October, according to the Department of Commerce.For Levin and other like-minded economists, this is evidence that the jobs market continues to hold back inflation despite the historically low official unemployment rate of 4.1 percent as of October. The most inclusive unemployment figure, which counts workforce dropouts and people working part-time involuntarily, remains much higher at 7.9 percent.That could be one reason why employers have been slower to give workers a raise. Wages before inflation grew just 2.3 percent in the 12 months ending in October, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.The slow wage growth is one of the factors that stems inflation, since employers raise prices to compensate for the added cost of salaries, Levin said.“If what we see over the next year is hopefully some moderate pickup in wage growth, that would be good,” Levin said. “That would give the Fed breathing room to make a few more modest hikes next year, but keep rates relatively low compared to historical norms.”He added that Powell “has shown no signs thus far of being eager to raise rates ― and that’s probably one of the reasons he was chosen” for the Fed chairmanship by Trump."

80,ENTERTAINMENT,New Star-Studded Movie Aims To Tell Mary Magdalene's Story,Carol Kuruvilla,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/star-studded-movie-mary-magdalene_us_5a202071e4b0a8581e689ae7,It's the story of Jesus -- from a woman's perspective.,2017-11-30,Rooney Mara plays Mary Magdalene in an upcoming Biblical biopic.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a2024a71400003742b6aa24.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The story of Jesus Christ’s death, crucifixion and resurrection has been told numerous times in Hollywood. Now, a new movie trailer is promising to deliver the same gospel tale in an important new way ― from the perspective of a woman. On Wednesday, Universal Pictures UK released its first glimpse of“Mary Magdalene,” the upcoming Biblical biopic. Award-winning actress Rooney Mara plays Mary, a woman from the village of Magdala on the shore of the Sea of Galilee.The New Testament describes Mary Magdalene as one of Jesus’ closest followers. For centuries, she’s been an enigma, a complex and compelling character. While most of Jesus’ male apostles fled as soon as the religious figure was sent to prison, the Gospels claim that Mary stood by his side. She was present at the crucifixion and is said to be the first person Jesus revealed himself to after the resurrection.Mary Magdalene’s story has been explored and elaborated on in pop culture for quite some time. This new film, directed by Garth Davis, attempts to fill in the gaps present in Mary’s story.In the trailer, she’s shown speaking privately to Jesus (played by Joaquin Phoenix) and even conducting baptisms for women. She’s looked upon with jealousy and confusion by one of Jesus’ apostles, Peter.“It’s not right that he has raised you up to lead us,” Peter, played Chiwetel Ejiofor, says in the trailer. The film exploring the pivotal role Mary Magdalene played in early Christian history comes at a time when women’s roles in religious leadership positions are growing ― with more women getting ordained, speaking from pulpits and rising in official positions.“Mary Magdalene” is expected to premiere in the U.S. on March 30, 2018."

The “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” star shared a photo on the social media platform of herself and fellow actress Ngô Thanh Vân promoting the upcoming film in Vietnam.The pair wore Áo Dài, traditional Vietnamese clothing, while promoting the film ― bringing pride to Asians everywhere. What’s more, Tran also paid tribute to her roots in the post. “Growing up, I’ve always felt I was from two different worlds. I was born in the US, but my parents were born in Vietnam, and they raised my sisters and I with the parenting methods of the Vietnamese culture,” she explained in the emotional post. “So much of me is because of what my parents experienced in this country. So much of me is because of the things my parents overcame so that I could have the luxury of having a dream.”She added that she feels proud of her Vietnamese-American identity and, while visiting Vietnam, has been able to see so much of herself in the people around her. Tran has spoken about her love for her heritage before, as well as the struggles her family has been through in the past. Her father had been homeless in Vietnam for seven years, she told BuzzFeed News. In an interview with People, she revealed that her parents came to the U.S. following the Vietnam War and made a living in their new country far from the entertainment industry. “They worked from nothing just to give me the opportunity to have a dream,” she told the outlet. “My mom works in funerals and my dad works at Burger King.”While her parents weren’t always so on board with her career choice, Tran felt she needed to pursue her dreams.In a way, she told BuzzFeed, it’s exactly what they wanted her to do. “I truly did feel that I owed it to my parents, my grandparents, to do whatever it was that I wanted, because if I wasn’t happy, if I wasn’t being true to myself, then I wasn’t living fully,” she said. “They had given up so much so that I could live at the level that so many people are just automatically born into.” "

Kristy Woods said she last saw her daughter ― who has brown hair, blue eyes and weighs about 30 pounds ― on Sunday night around 11 p.m., after she put her to bed.On Monday, authorities issued a statewide Amber Alert as they began investigating. By Tuesday, the FBI had joined them, Reuters reported. The agency was asking the public to help provide any relevant information. “Our focus right now is to find her, to bring her back and then to find out what happened,” Onslow County Sheriff Hans Miller said at a news conference Tuesday afternoon. Miller said authorities “will not rule out any situation that may have occurred.”“Please, bring her back ... She’s my baby, she’s my everything,” Woods said at a press conference on Monday. “Just to be able to touch her and hold her and not let her go again, I’d give anything.”The child uses orthopedic braces on her feet to walk, her grandmother Melissa Hunter told reporters.Mariah’s father, Alex Woods, who does not live with her mother, has expressed skepticism about the circumstances surrounding his daughter’s disappearance. “Someone just walked right up in there, grabbed the three-year-old out of the bed and she didn’t cry, she didn’t scream?” he told local ABC News affiliate WCTI News on Tuesday morning. “Nobody heard anything? Four people in the house, two adults and two kids, someone just comes up and snatches the baby and walks out?”Woods, who said he only found out his daughter was missing when the Amber Alert went out, told WCTI that he had been given custody of the young girl and her brothers last year while child protective services investigated an incident involving their mother, but that he had not seen the children since.The first 48 hours after a child goes missing are a critical period for authorities to locate and return the child safely. Each year, hundreds of thousands of children go missing in the United States ― and the vast majority return home alive. Anyone with information about Mariah is asked to call the FBI’s Charlotte Field Office at (704) 672-6100, or the Onslow County Sheriff’s Office at (910) 455-3113."
83,ENTERTAINMENT,'The Disaster Artist' Is The Highlight Of James Franco's Career,Matthew Jacobs,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/james-franco-the-disaster-artist_us_5a1dc724e4b056995023147f,"After years of ebbs and flows, the actor, director and all-around workaholic talks about making a movie about the worst movie ever made.",2017-11-29,"James Franco directs a scene from ""The Disaster Artist.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a1dd28f150000016485a4d3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"In brainstorming headlines for this article, the first idea that came to mind was “James Franco Is Doing The Most.”It’s an evergreen choice, really. James Franco has always done the most. Between 2005 and 2017, he’s directed 14 feature-length fiction films, most of which you’ve probably never heard of, as well as a handful of shorts and documentaries. He also finished an undergraduate degree from UCLA and earned an MFA from Columbia University; published a short story collection, two poetry anthologies and a novel; hosted the Oscars the same year he received a nomination for “127 Hours”; made a multimedia project based on the sitcom “Three’s Company”; made a multimedia project in which he nakedly wrestled the artist Paul McCarthy; acted in movies as varied as “Milk,” “Rise of the Planet of the Apes” and “Spring Breakers”; baited us to question his sexuality; taught classes at UCLA and NYU; and somehow found a free moment to write a New York Times op-ed defending Shia LaBeouf’s “performance art.”Yes, it’s been quite the decade for the elder Franco ― and 2017 may very well be his best year to date. “The Deuce,” the HBO drama on which he portrays twin brothers with connections to the mob, was a critical and commercial hit. Now his latest directorial endeavor, “The Disaster Artist,” has become a key player in the ongoing Oscar derby. It feels like Franco, whose restless oddities had become something of a punchline, is finally finding his way again.Because he is nothing if not a multi-hyphenate, Franco also stars in “The Disaster Artist,” delivering the sharpest performance of his career. He uncannily plays Tommy Wiseau, the enigmatic director of “The Room,” proverbially known as the worst movie ever made. Based on a book co-written by Wiseau’s friend Greg Sestero (portrayed in the film by Dave Franco) and journalist Tom Bissell, “The Disaster Artist” transforms the making of “The Room” into an uproarious and surprisingly layered portrait of friendship, perseverance and utter foolishness. Oh, and Franco stayed in character while directing it, in case you want to add another line item to his résumé.I talked to Franco in New York a few weeks ago, before his Gotham Award victory for Best Actor elevated his status in the Academy Awards contest. Last time we met, when Franco was promoting the 2016 gay-porn drama “King Cobra,” he came across as aloof; this time, he was cheerful and engaged. We discussed his workaholic tendencies, feeling like people had grown tired of him, and his affection for Wiseau, who’s become a dear friend.You’re hosting “Saturday Night Live” in December. What’s it like to return, having made a documentary about the show?It feels like home. I think Keenan probably might be the only one who was in my doc. We made the doc about eight years ago, I think. I made it when I was at NYU. That was one of my assignments. But I feel at home there. It’s still Lorne.Your IMDb page is wild. Just realizing the number of movies you’ve directed, most of which made very little money, is an exercise in wondering how the hell you found all that time.It’s crazy. You know, I was talking about this very thing this morning — this idea of over-scheduling. It’s almost an addict behavior, where, if you think of an addict as someone doing something to avoid himself or to avoid his life or avoid pain or avoid fear, that’s kind of, in a weird way, what I was doing. This over-scheduling prevents any time to just relax, obviously, or any time for self-reflection, any time for being with loved ones. That was part of it.I think what’s also part of it, and what’s so nice — and we can bring it to the two projects I have that came out this year, “The Deuce” and “The Disaster Artist” — is I’m so proud of those things. I get to work with [“The Wire” creators David Simon and George Pelecanos] on “The Deuce,” my heroes. And I got to direct two of the eight episodes last season, and I’ll get to do them on this new season. And then on “The Disaster Artist,” I had Seth Rogen and his company, Point Grey, produce it, because the smarter part of my brain was like, “Get strong producers that will get you to focus.” That way I wouldn’t be doing what you’re seeing on the IMDb, where it’s like 20 things at once. But on the other hand, I think, having done all of those movies and all those things at such a frantic pace, even if not every one of those things was successful or whatever, I think what it did was it did give me a lot of experience so that I then am capable of directing something like “The Deuce” and something like “The Disaster Artist.” And, in fact, once I marshaled everything and focused and had producers that I wanted to do a good job for and that would demand that I focus, then I could do the best work of my career, in a way.It does feel like a James Franco comeback moment, which is weird because you never really went anywhere.Yeah, it’s “we had enough of you.”Is that how you felt?In a way. I had enough of me. But, in fact, I did go away. It’s just that there was so much work backlogged that I think it hasn’t quite caught up yet. I actually only acted for two weeks this whole year, on this Coen brothers project for Netflix, “The Ballad of Buster Scruggs.” I actually have pulled back, and when I did “The Deuce” and I did “The Disaster Artist,” I did focus. I really just put all my energy into those things when I was doing them. The big lesson for me are the results. I’m really happy with them, and it’s like, “Oh, go figure, James. You actually put care and time into something, and you reaped a different kind of results.”While you were directing so many movies and writing, was there a project that especially disappointed you because it didn’t find an audience?No, I mean, I think there are a lot of reasons to do a lot of things. Like I said, to just avoid myself. But also to get better. When I first started acting, I left UCLA and my parents were like, “You have to support yourself,” and I ended up working at McDonald’s. That put in my mind, like, “OK, dude, you’re making this choice. You’re working at McDonald’s. You better show that you want this.” That kind of started this whole pattern: Just throw yourself into it headlong, and just do it 24/7. And then, as an actor, that reaped results. I was on “Freaks and Geeks” two or three years later, and when I got into directing, I kind of thought the same thing: Just throw yourself into it. And here I am with two projects that I’m really, really proud of.And that people are responding to magnificently.Yeah, I guess I graduated film school seven years ago, and I think seven years of just going at it definitely gave me some things. But after a while, that kind of workaholic approach had diminishing returns. Anyway, I think also part of the idea of doing a lot of things was that I also, maybe, in the back of my mind knew that I was doing these very literary projects that were not going to reach a large audience. There’s things I did, like this movie “Child of God,” which was an adaptation of a Cormac McCarthy book — I was really proud of that. I still am really proud of that. I think it’s an interesting film. I think there’s an incredible performance in it by Scott Haze. I was really proud of the way I put that story together. But the subject matter is super dark. It’s about a necrophiliac. It’s not going to bring in big audiences. And we did get a great review in The New York Times, but overall, yeah, it kind of bummed me out that people didn’t see what I saw in that, the artistry of it. Things like that. But, again, it was part of the learning phase.Now, you’re embedded with Tommy Wiseau, this cult figure who also went above and beyond to do what he wanted to do. When was the first time you heard of “The Room”?The first time I saw that face was on that billboard. [...] It just said “The Room” and had that phone number and that picture [of Wiseau’s face]. The thing was up for five years on Highland Boulevard. I must have passed it 100, 200 times because I was living in LA. It just didn’t penetrate, because there were just weird things in LA. There was this guy named Dennis Woodruff who’d drive around in these weird cars that were covered in trash and weird stuffed animals. They’d say, “Call this number and put me in your movie!” There was this woman named Angelyne who drove around in this pink Corvette, and she’d have her own billboards, too. So I just figured either you’d call the “Room” number if you wanted a vampire in your movie, or that it was a cult or something. Because what movie has a phone number on the billboard? That’s sort of all I knew.And during those five years, you never found out what “The Room” actually was?I later learned that friends of mine, like Jonah Hill and Paul Rudd, were part of the “Room” crew and would go to the Sunset 5, where it was playing at midnight on the weekends. I guess they just never told me about it, and then I finally found out about it when I read the book when it came out four years ago. Before I was halfway done, I was like, “This is an amazing story.” I love Hollywood history. I love Hollywood stories. I read books about Hollywood about as much as anything. I knew, as a storyteller, I’m obviously drawn to things that are unusual. Even when I was doing movies about a necrophiliac or Faulkner stories, I was always still looking for a way to tell those stories so that they wouldn’t be completely off-putting.Even with “Child of God,” I found a way in where it was like, in fact, [the main character] is not unlike all of us. He’s looking for what we’re all looking for: love. It’s just that he’s so socially awkward, and he’s so ostracized from society that the only way he can get that is through a dead body, right? But that’s just to say I’m always looking for ways to tell unusual stories, bizarre stories that have a hook. I don’t want to turn off audiences — I’m just not interested in the cliché. Here, with this book, I was like, my god, this is everything I wanted. It’s the most bizarre Hollywood story ever, but underneath it’s completely universal.Right, because Tommy pairs up with Greg Sestero, who ended up starring in “The Room” and supporting Tommy’s lunacies. It’s really a story about friendship.About friendship, and about outsiders and dreamers, which everyone who goes into a profession starts as. We all start on the outside, and we have these dreams of quote-unquote making it. That’s what this is at its core. So I was like, OK, maybe this is my oddball slash commercial moment, or at least something that can reach a larger audience. I was doing “The Interview” with Seth and his company in Vancouver, and I gave them the book. I was like, “Help me make this. You guys know how to work with studios and still make the movies you want to make. I think this thing has crossover potential. Help me do it.”Part of the lore of Tommy Wiseau is how little we know about his history: specifically where he was born and how he became rich. There’s a documentary in the works that attempts to answer those questions.“A Room Full of Spoons,” which Tommy tried to stop. They just overcame that, and it will come out eventually.Now that you know him, what do you make of the investigations into Tommy’s real life, given how secretive he is?I actually haven’t watched it, but the thing about that is, I think the guy who made it is a fan of Tommy’s. You can go online, and people have theories about the three mysteries about Tommy: his age, where he got his money and where he’s from. To me, that’s cool and fine. I don’t think it actually takes away from anything. What’s more interesting to me about Tommy is the self-creation, the persona that he’s put on, and how hard and how tightly he holds this creation, and what’s behind that need to live behind this facade.He created his own character. His life has become a strange movie, and he’s the star.Yeah! What is that? That’s what’s interesting. In our movie, we preserve the mystery. Our movie is not about debunking those mysteries. We touch on it a little bit, but it’s more about upholding the facade, or whatever — it’s not even a facade. It’s just his version of himself. What we do uncover is the emotional through-line of his character. We do reveal his emotional highs and lows, and give a sense of how badly he needs to hold on to this character that he’s created.“The Disaster Artist” opens in limited release on Dec. 1. It expands nationwide Dec. 8.Language in this story has been amended to better describe Franco’s workaholic tendencies."

That’s sort of all I knew.And during those five years, you never found out what “The Room” actually was?I later learned that friends of mine, like Jonah Hill and Paul Rudd, were part of the “Room” crew and would go to the Sunset 5, where it was playing at midnight on the weekends. I guess they just never told me about it, and then I finally found out about it when I read the book when it came out four years ago. Before I was halfway done, I was like, “This is an amazing story.” I love Hollywood history. I love Hollywood stories. I read books about Hollywood about as much as anything. I knew, as a storyteller, I’m obviously drawn to things that are unusual. Even when I was doing movies about a necrophiliac or Faulkner stories, I was always still looking for a way to tell those stories so that they wouldn’t be completely off-putting.Even with “Child of God,” I found a way in where it was like, in fact, [the main character] is not unlike all of us. He’s looking for what we’re all looking for: love. It’s just that he’s so socially awkward, and he’s so ostracized from society that the only way he can get that is through a dead body, right? But that’s just to say I’m always looking for ways to tell unusual stories, bizarre stories that have a hook. I don’t want to turn off audiences — I’m just not interested in the cliché. Here, with this book, I was like, my god, this is everything I wanted. It’s the most bizarre Hollywood story ever, but underneath it’s completely universal.Right, because Tommy pairs up with Greg Sestero, who ended up starring in “The Room” and supporting Tommy’s lunacies. It’s really a story about friendship.About friendship, and about outsiders and dreamers, which everyone who goes into a profession starts as. We all start on the outside, and we have these dreams of quote-unquote making it. That’s what this is at its core. So I was like, OK, maybe this is my oddball slash commercial moment, or at least something that can reach a larger audience. I was doing “The Interview” with Seth and his company in Vancouver, and I gave them the book. I was like, “Help me make this. You guys know how to work with studios and still make the movies you want to make. I think this thing has crossover potential. Help me do it.”Part of the lore of Tommy Wiseau is how little we know about his history: specifically where he was born and how he became rich. There’s a documentary in the works that attempts to answer those questions.“A Room Full of Spoons,” which Tommy tried to stop. They just overcame that, and it will come out eventually.Now that you know him, what do you make of the investigations into Tommy’s real life, given how secretive he is?I actually haven’t watched it, but the thing about that is, I think the guy who made it is a fan of Tommy’s. You can go online, and people have theories about the three mysteries about Tommy: his age, where he got his money and where he’s from. To me, that’s cool and fine. I don’t think it actually takes away from anything. What’s more interesting to me about Tommy is the self-creation, the persona that he’s put on, and how hard and how tightly he holds this creation, and what’s behind that need to live behind this facade.He created his own character. His life has become a strange movie, and he’s the star.Yeah! What is that? That’s what’s interesting. In our movie, we preserve the mystery. Our movie is not about debunking those mysteries. We touch on it a little bit, but it’s more about upholding the facade, or whatever — it’s not even a facade. It’s just his version of himself. What we do uncover is the emotional through-line of his character. We do reveal his emotional highs and lows, and give a sense of how badly he needs to hold on to this character that he’s created.“The Disaster Artist” opens in limited release on Dec. 1. It expands nationwide Dec. 8.Language in this story has been amended to better describe Franco’s workaholic tendencies."

Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/noaa-nominee-barry-myers_us_5a1efc36e4b017a311ebe751,"Barry Myers, chief executive of AccuWeather, has previously pushed to privatize weather data.",2017-11-29,Barry Myers answers questions at his Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a1efcf71400004f7750fdc5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Unlike all of his predecessors, Barry Myers, President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, is not a scientist.Yet unlike nearly every other environmental agency head picked by the current White House, the chief executive of the forecasting company AccuWeather understands that climate change is real and caused by humans.“If ice is melting, ice is melting, and one’s opinion about it doesn’t matter,” Myers said Wednesday morning at a confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. “We can’t dispute the facts once they’re in front of us, and we need to act upon them.”But Myers’ apparent break with an administration stacked full of people who reject the overwhelming evidence that climate change is serious, worsening and manmade didn’t trump Democratic senators’ concerns that he’s going to make major changes at NOAA ― changes like privatizing the information the National Weather Service produces or forcing the agency to rely on private companies’ satellite data.The 74-year-old businessman has complained in the past about publicly funded products rivaling his company’s services. “We work hard every day competing with other companies and we also have to compete with the government,” Myers told ABC News in May 2005.That same year, AccuWeather spent $40,000 lobbying the House, Senate and Commerce Department ― which includes NOAA ― on “commercial weather industry issues,” according to a lobbying disclosure first reported by CNN. Then-Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.), who in 2005 introduced a bill aimed at preventing NOAA and the National Weather Service from competing with some services offered by private companies, received donations from Barry Myers and his brother, Joel Myers, who founded AccuWeather.In March of this year, Barry Myers told The Washington Post that a bill instructing NOAA to work with private companies on matters like buying commercially provided weather data, instead of launching new government satellites, would “serve as a blue print for the next NOAA administrator.”Myers, who has promised to fully divest from AccuWeather if he’s confirmed, said Wednesday that he would not seek to privatize services. But the White House is calling for a 16 percent NOAA budget cut, slashing roughly $900 million from climate, weather and Arctic research.“I understand the nature of the cuts, and I understand why they were done,” Myers said, adding that the offices within NOAA will “need to certainly examine all their programs.”Pressed by Democrats on the science committee, Myers pledged to maintain climate research and to allow scientists to speak publicly about their peer-reviewed work. He also said he would not assign scientists to other divisions based on the conclusions of their research.“I know what quality research looks like. I know what peer-reviewed research looks like,” he said. “Scientists should be free to operate in that kind of an environment.”Myers’ assurances stand in stark contrast to the acts of other Trump officials and nominees with environmental responsibilities.Scott Pruitt, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and an ardent global warming denier, has spent his nearly 10 months in office dismantling climate regulations, expunging climate science and creating new rules to favor industry-funded research. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has been accused of reassigning a federal scientist for warning about the dangers of climate change to Alaska natives. Kathleen Hartnett White advanced to a full Senate confirmation Wednesday to lead the White House’s Council on Environmental Quality, despite demonstrating cringeworthy ignorance of basic scientific facts at a hearing earlier this month.But telling senators the right thing isn’t enough. Energy Secretary Rick Perry danced around the issue of climate science at his confirmation hearing and played up the growth of wind energy in Texas while he was governor. Yet Perry has turned out to be one of the most vocal supporters for eliminating greenhouse gas regulations, withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement and bailing out the coal industry with taxpayer money.During Wednesday’s hearing, Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.), perhaps the most vehement climate change denier in the Senate, asked Myers if he would “be willing to listen to qualified scientists on every subject, including climate change.” Coming from a lawmaker who once brought a snowball to the Senate floor to try to disprove the warming of the planet, it was a loaded question, essentially inquiring about Myers’ openness to debunked research that calls the consensus on climate change into question.Myers smiled. “Yes,” he said. “I would, Senator.”"

According to the former lead of chart-topping Christian act Everyday Sunday, the phrase has “been my mantra in this whole journey, this process of coming out to myself and my family and publicly.” “Any time you’re changing seasons in life, there is always something from the season behind that needs to be grieved, even when it is the best thing for you,” Pearson explained the concept on Party Foul Radio with Pollo & Pearl.With Everyday Sunday, Pearson was a favorite at Christian radio stations worldwide. From 1997 until 2016, when the group disbanded, the Columbus, OH-based rockers charted 20 Top 10 singles on U.S. Christian charts; five went to No. 1.Throughout that time, though, Pearson struggled with his sexuality. Raised in an “Evangelical Western Christian faith” — “You’re supposed to save yourself for marriage,” he pointed out — he never even kissed a woman before his wedding night.“It was easy for me, because I didn’t have a desire,” he confessed, “But I wanted to have the desire.”When things did not go as planned on his honeymoon, Pearson knew immediately something was wrong. He continued to pray for years that things would change, that he would become sexually attracted to his wife. That never happened, he told Podomatic’s No. 1 LGBTQ Podcast.After “failing miserably” in his efforts to be the husband she deserved, Pearson’s wife finally questioned whether he might be gay. Shared the musician: “In that moment, when she seriously asked, I knew I could either continue suppressing it or I could get help and be set free.”Spurred by the collapse of his marriage, Pearson entered counseling. After much effort, he was able to admit to a pastor friend he was gay. “I was finally able to accept myself for the first time, then come out to [my wife] and my family,” Pearson shared. “It was a really difficult journey,” he acknowledged, “Over a few month period there were only a couple of days when I didn’t completely bawl my eyes out realizing my life was never going to look the same.”LISTEN: Singer Trey Pearson Talks Coming Out, New Album Love Is LoveAfter coming out publicly in 2016, in an interview with a magazine in his hometown, Pearson’s process of self-discovery continued — “There are things I have never allowed myself to experience my whole life,” he shared — aided by the medium he knows best. The result is new album Love Is Love. “I really think [being gay] was something I had been pushing down creatively as well,” Pearson stated. “I hadn’t allowed myself to go there [emotionally]. That opened me up creatively in so many ways, and even where I was willing to go in my music.” As he grew to accept his sexuality, a lifetime of “things I had suppressed burst open,” Pearson noted. Those “poured into” work on Love Is Love. Recording the seven-song EP, available through all online retailers Nov. 17, proved “therapeutic.” “In a way, I think I didn’t have a choice but to go deeper down than I ever had before and express all these things I needed to express,” the father of two stated. “I think that really came out in these songs I’ve been writing.”In approaching every song, Pearson said, he “either wanted to make you cry or dance — sometimes both.” As a result, Love Is Love runs the gamut of emotions, from its affirming title track and first single, to the wrenching. The still deeply-religious singer questions his place in faith with the heart-felt “Hey Jesus.” He revels in the excitement of a new relationship on “Rush” and even challenges those who say he will “burn in hell” to not kick up their heels on “Don’t Dance.” Two of the more emotional tracks carry the name of his “mantra.” Bookending the release are “The Good Grief” and “The Good Grief (Part 2),” which the singer discussed at length during the extended interview. This concept regarding the “changing of seasons” in his life, said Pearson, is “two-fold.” WATCH: Trey Pearson “The Good Grief”“There’s this part of you that grieves — a part of me that grieves — I didn’t get to experience a lot of things most people get to experience growing up,” Pearson confessed: “Those crushes, the real ‘young love’ romances.” At the same time, the 37-year-old accepts he would not be where he is today had he not traveled this road. That reality couples with another facet of loss, Pearson explained. “It’s not as much the ‘fans’ I am losing that’s as hard as the people in my life that I really love with all my heart that just don’t love me for who I am,” he shared. “They might try to love me in spite of who I am, but that doesn’t work real well,” Pearson continued. “You notice you don’t have that great of relationships with those people any more, because they don’t know how to act with you or don’t know how to just love you genuinely for who you are.” As the idea of “the good grief” explains, even when actions are absolutely necessary, they often do carry a significant emotional toll. Though he concedes coming out “has been the best thing that’s ever happened to” him, Pearson can’t deny the price he’s paid. “Even though I am so thankful to be where I am — I have never felt so free, and I’ve never been so happy in my whole life — there’s definitely been some loss,” he shared. “I think it is just accepting that and realizing sometimes people won’t be willing to go there with you,” Pearson went on to say. “To be your best self, your truest self, your most authentic self, sometimes it means people not loving you for who you are and not accepting it within their box of how they think life was supposed to be.” As he forges ahead in both his music career and new life as an out gay man, he has noticed many downplay how “big of a deal” coming out is to so many still today. Pearson expressed tremendous appreciation for those who courageously paved the way. “I’m so grateful for the people who have come before us to allow me to finally get to the place where I could accept myself,” he stated. “I realized from the literally thousands and thousands of messages I’ve gotten since I came out last summer how much further we have to go,” Pearson concluded, “And why it’s so important to tell our stories. There’s a responsibility there.”Follow Party Foul Radio on Twitter.Follow Trey Pearson on Twitter.LISTEN: Trey Pearson Shares His Story on Podomatic’s No. 1 LGBTQ Podcast"

Each photo is accompanied by a short interview with the sisters, written by journalist Emma Finamore. Some of them speak of strained moments in their relationships ― childhood arguments in shared bedrooms and periods of jealousy ― but through it all, their bonds have endured.As one younger sister named Flo puts it, “I’m probably more happy and comfortable in [my older sister’s] company than anyone else’s.”In an interview with HuffPost, Harris-Taylor said the book was inspired by her sister and their relationship, which she admits is a work in progress. “For years, I felt a pressure to conform and have a kind of relationship with my own sister that for so many reasons didn’t come naturally,” she said. “Like all relationships, it changes and recently we’ve been in touch more.

The event often features media luminaries discussing the future of digital businesses. Past conferences have included people like Amazon CEO and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos (who invested in Business Insider in 2013) and Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg.In the eight years that the conference has been held, it has featured 683 panelists. That group does not include a single black woman, according to a list of panelists published online by Business Insider and reviewed by HuffPost. It is not clear if some panelists were not listed on the website, and Business Insider spokesman Mario Ruiz did not respond to a HuffPost question on the matter.Ruiz also did not reply to multiple messages asking to confirm whether there had been a single black woman on any of the Ignition panels over the years. He told HuffPost the company aims to invite women of color every year, “including this year inviting Uber chief brand officer Bozoma Saint John, who was unable to join us.” Saint John did not respond to a request for comment.SiriusXM Radio Director of Progressive Programming Zerlina Maxwell said on Twitter that she was “not surprised” by the lack of black women among panelists.There is a diversity gap in media and digital industries. But there is no shortage of potential invitees for a conference like Ignition, including top executives at media companies like CNN and NBC, as well as prominent black women journalists and editors. While Asian women, Latinas and other women of color have had some representation over the years at the event, black women have been left out completely.A section on the 2016 website for the conference describes it as “unscripted interviews, cutting-edge demos, and insights from industry pioneers” and says participants will learn “what key trends to be aware of and what you need to do to stay ahead.”This year’s conference, scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday, is dubbed “The Future of Media” and features 80 panelists. Like past years, its lineup does not appear to include a single black woman. Panelists this year include New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet (who is black) and Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron. The conference will also feature powerful women in media, such as Janice Min, the former editor-in-chief and part-owner of The Hollywood Reporter, and Jodi Kantor, the New York Times reporter who helped break the Harvey Weinstein sexual assault accusations.“It is unfathomable that Business Insider can assert that they will be showcasing the best in media, marketing and technology yet include no Black women among its 80-person panel,” said April Reign, the activist who created #OscarsSoWhite. “One wonders whether concerted efforts were made regarding inclusion of marginalized communities or if Business Insider is simply uninterested in learning from diverse communities that drive billions of dollars of revenue in this country each year.”"

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). But few, if any, are more disturbed by his political punchline than indigenous women.Trump first adopted “Pocahontas” as dig against Warren during his 2016 presidential campaign, when he repeatedly accused the senator of lying about her Native American ancestry. Trump used the phrase again on Monday, during a ceremony meant to honor Navajo Code Talkers. HuffPost spoke to several native women after the incident. They all said they were deeply bothered by Trump’s comments, which overlook the violence many indigenous women still experience today. Holding up Pocahontas as a caricature of native heritage, they said, ignores the abuse she endured.“It sends the message that natives are invisible,” said Caroline LaPorte, a descendent of the Little River Band of Ottawa Indians and senior native affairs policy adviser for the National Indigenous Women’s Resource Center.Most non-natives are familiar with Disney’s version of Pocahontas: an American Indian princess who befriends and falls in love with John Smith, a charming lad sent from England to help colonize the New World. Pocahontas saves Smith from being executed by her father, Chief Powhatan ― and they all live happily ever after.Historians and Native American experts vehemently dispute that narrative. What Pocahontas experienced was “no love story,” LaPorte said. “She was raped and kidnapped,” LaPorte told HuffPost. “She’s basically our first well-documented human trafficking victim in the U.S. We’ve romanticized her story ― and it’s just not true. Her story is a story of colonization.” Oral traditions suggest Pocahontas was just 10 or 11 years old when she first met the colonists. She was taken prisoner a few years later and held in present-day Jamestown, Virginia, where she was forced to convert to Christianity.By the time she was 17, an Englishman named John Rolfe had married her and moved her across the Atlantic Ocean. She spent the next few years as a political pawn, paraded around the English court in an effort to promote partnerships with American natives.Pocahontas died by the age of 21, effectively ending whatever protection from the colonists her marriage may have provided to her people. The cause of her death is debated. Some accounts suggest she died from pneumonia or smallpox; others say she was poisoned.Gender-based violence, including sexual assault and intimate partner violence, has continued to plague Native American women at staggering levels.“Maybe we’re not taken on a ship to England, but somebody is likely perpetuating the same acts of violence against the majority of women in our community,” LaPorte said. Four out of 5 American Indian or Alaskan Native women experience violence in their lifetime ― more than any other population in the U.S., according to 2016 report from the Department of Justice. The report found that native women experience sexual assault at more than twice the rate at which the average U.S. woman does. Roughly 56 percent said they experienced sexual violence in their lifetime and over 55 percent experienced abuse by an intimate partner.“Every day we’re dealing with severe violence against native women,” said Amber Crotty, a delegate for the Navajo Nation Council. “I will not allow the president of this country to continue to disregard Pocahontas and what her legacy is. She’s not a character. She’s a native woman who suffered, and her story is our story.”“We are the most victimized group of people in the United States,” said Terri Henry, the first female tribal leader of the Eastern Band of Cherokee and former co-chair of the National Congress of American Indians’ Task Force on Violence Against Women.Compounding that trauma is the fact that most perpetrators are never brought to justice. More than 96 percent of sexual violence against native women is committed by non-natives, the Justice Department reports, but tribes are limited in their abilities to prosecute non-tribal members.“The disproportionate rates of violence are largely due to an unworkable, discriminatory legal system that severely limits the authority of tribal nations to protect our people from violence,” Henry wrote in a statement last year, when she was co-chair of the NCAI’s task force. “As a result, we are denied justice and redress because we are indigenous and assaulted on our homelands.”Federal funding to address these issues is limited, and some indigenous experts worry budget cuts under the Trump administration would only deepen the funding gaps.Marilyn Gobert, lead victim advocate for the Blackfeet Domestic Violence Program, said the administration’s proposed budget cuts make Trump’s remarks feel more like a “slap in the face.”“Our program runs off of federal and state grants,” Gobert told HuffPost, referring to the program that provides support for native women who experience domestic violence in northern Montana. “When [Trump] cuts some of these budgets, that’s taking money from our program to serve the women that are living in violence.”Funding cuts would hurt a contingency of programs focusing on domestic violence against natives that are already strapped for resources. There are 567 native tribes across the U.S., LaPorte said, but fewer than 60 Native American domestic violence shelters. These specialized shelters are essential for providing support for native victims who don’t want to leave their reservations and need to navigate complicated legal issues related to tribal courts. Native victim advocates can speak the relevant tribal languages and are able to support victims while being mindful of how the historical trauma of colonization can affect indigenous people.“If you have to leave your tribal land or state to get the nearest native-run [domestic violence] shelter, you’re being pulled from your culture completely,” LaPorte said. “It’s important for native women to participate in their culture both spiritually and politically.”In the meantime, tribal advocates are pushing to include crucial amendments in a law that could give native women more protections.Congress passed the Violence Against Women Act in 1994 to provide additional support to women who are victims of violent crimes. VAWA’s most recent authorization, in 2013, restored tribes’ jurisdiction to prosecute non-natives for specific crimes, such as domestic violence and gang violence. But the law still does not cover sexual violence outside of an intimate partner relationship.“In native communities a lot of violence against women doesn’t fit that strict definition,” LaPorte said.Tribal advocates are calling for this year’s reauthorization of the law to include an amendment that would restore tribes’ jurisdiction to prosecute non-natives for other types of crimes, including sexual violence, sex trafficking and stalking.Until then, these native women want Trump to keep in mind that they are not merely objects of a bygone era, nor relics of the white man’s native fantasy.“We are human beings,” Henry said. “We are not animals. We deserve the opportunity to live our lives free from harm and free from being preyed upon.”"

More than 96 percent of sexual violence against native women is committed by non-natives, the Justice Department reports, but tribes are limited in their abilities to prosecute non-tribal members.“The disproportionate rates of violence are largely due to an unworkable, discriminatory legal system that severely limits the authority of tribal nations to protect our people from violence,” Henry wrote in a statement last year, when she was co-chair of the NCAI’s task force. “As a result, we are denied justice and redress because we are indigenous and assaulted on our homelands.”Federal funding to address these issues is limited, and some indigenous experts worry budget cuts under the Trump administration would only deepen the funding gaps.Marilyn Gobert, lead victim advocate for the Blackfeet Domestic Violence Program, said the administration’s proposed budget cuts make Trump’s remarks feel more like a “slap in the face.”“Our program runs off of federal and state grants,” Gobert told HuffPost, referring to the program that provides support for native women who experience domestic violence in northern Montana. “When [Trump] cuts some of these budgets, that’s taking money from our program to serve the women that are living in violence.”Funding cuts would hurt a contingency of programs focusing on domestic violence against natives that are already strapped for resources. There are 567 native tribes across the U.S., LaPorte said, but fewer than 60 Native American domestic violence shelters. These specialized shelters are essential for providing support for native victims who don’t want to leave their reservations and need to navigate complicated legal issues related to tribal courts. Native victim advocates can speak the relevant tribal languages and are able to support victims while being mindful of how the historical trauma of colonization can affect indigenous people.“If you have to leave your tribal land or state to get the nearest native-run [domestic violence] shelter, you’re being pulled from your culture completely,” LaPorte said. “It’s important for native women to participate in their culture both spiritually and politically.”In the meantime, tribal advocates are pushing to include crucial amendments in a law that could give native women more protections.Congress passed the Violence Against Women Act in 1994 to provide additional support to women who are victims of violent crimes. VAWA’s most recent authorization, in 2013, restored tribes’ jurisdiction to prosecute non-natives for specific crimes, such as domestic violence and gang violence. But the law still does not cover sexual violence outside of an intimate partner relationship.“In native communities a lot of violence against women doesn’t fit that strict definition,” LaPorte said.Tribal advocates are calling for this year’s reauthorization of the law to include an amendment that would restore tribes’ jurisdiction to prosecute non-natives for other types of crimes, including sexual violence, sex trafficking and stalking.Until then, these native women want Trump to keep in mind that they are not merely objects of a bygone era, nor relics of the white man’s native fantasy.“We are human beings,” Henry said. “We are not animals. We deserve the opportunity to live our lives free from harm and free from being preyed upon.”"
91,WOMEN,Another GOP Lawmaker Got Caught In A Sex Scandal. Here's Why You Should Defend Him.,Noah Michelson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/joe-barton-sex-scandal_us_5a1d8e2fe4b06a14100a563f,There are plenty of reasons to dislike Rep. Joe Barton. His dick pics shouldn't be one of them.,2017-11-29,Rep. Joe Barton apologized for ”[letting his] constituents down.”,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a1ef1931400004f7750fd7d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NOTE: Several hours before this story was published, a new report appeared in the Star-Telegram that alleged Rep. Joe Barton engaged in “a series of private messages — some with sexual overtones” while still married to his wife. Barton has confirmed these messages but has not commented on them.On Thursday afternoon, Barton announced he would not be seeking re-election, saying, “There are enough people who lost faith in me that it’s time to step aside ... so I am not going to run for re-election.”I obviously do not defend any non-consensual sexual behavior by anyone regardless of their marital status. However, my defense of Barton’s consenual actions from last week as detailed below still stands.There is a specific, woozy kind of pleasure for me that is immediately conjured when a right-wing politician is caught ― quite literally ― with his pants down.It is an exhilarating joy similar to the feeling I once had riding Space Mountain with a close friend while high from an almost-too-strong pot brownie: I can’t wipe the goofy grin off of my face and I want to tell everyone about what just happened. But best of all, I don’t have to go to Disneyland to manifest this feeling, as it seems like every day another lawmaker is exposed as a two-faced, sex-crazed creep. The most recent case in point: Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas), who spent most of last week explaining why a photo of his dick was suddenly do-si-doing across the web after it was shared via an anonymous Twitter account.It appears several years ago, Barton sent a naked image of himself and a text reading “I want u soo bad. Right now” to a woman with whom he was engaged in a “heavily sexual” relationship. This woman was not his wife. She chose to speak out about their relationship now, she told The Washington Post, because “it’s not normal for a member of Congress who runs on a GOP platform of family values and conservatism to be scouring the Internet looking for a new sexual liaison.” A video of the lawmaker masturbating also turned up online for a short period of time before it was removed.And just like that, my social media feeds were full of posts about how disgusting ― but unsurprising ― the story was. I too was ready to write Barton off as just another sleazeball who proudly championed “family values” while wagging his willy for everyone but the woman he married. But once I got past the come-hither headlines and actually read what Barton did, I realized that, at least in this particular instance, he might deserve a more nuanced approach to his supposed sex crimes and ― gulp ― I might even have to come to his defense.Barton was separated from his wife (whom he later divorced) when the photos and video were taken and sent. What’s more, according to all of the reporting that I’ve seen, he was engaged in a completely consensual relationship with the woman (and other “mature adult women” ― apparently he was having sexual relations with several individuals) who received the graphic messages. So then, what exactly is Barton guilty of? Sending naked photos of himself to a consenting sexual partner. An embarrassing situation in which to find oneself ― hypocritical even, considering his endorsements from radically anti-queer, holier-than-thou, sex-negative groups like the Family Research Council and the Christian Coalition of America. But hardly a scandal compared to the revelations of sexual harassment, sexual assault and toxic masculinity that have surfaced daily. Rather than shrug his shoulders and toss a “so what?” in the general direction of anyone who was offended by the sight of his adult, consenting penis before getting back to work, Barton felt the need to apologize for not using “better judgment during those days” and for ”[letting his] constituents down.” He even agreed to launch an investigation into whether or not the person who leaked the pics and video could be punished under a 2015 Texas law that made “revenge porn” a crime. What he did not do is resign from office or vow to refrain from seeking re-election.Unfortunately for Barton, his fellow Republicans aren’t too pleased with his decision. “Since Mr. Barton’s highly publicized issues have come to light, I have talked to numerous Republican activists, leaders, voters and elected officials about this situation — not a single one of them thinks he should run again,” said Tim O’Hare, the leader of the Tarrant County Republican Party, told The Star-Telegram, adding, “I personally hope he learns from this and tries to be a better father and man.”Salon noted that “O’Hare’s feelings were echoed by roughly 20 Republican leaders who met Barton in Arlington to discuss his political future.”While I agree that I’d like to see Barton try to be “a better man” ― he did, after all, support a policy platform in 2010 that was pushing for the recriminalization of “sodomy” in Texas ― I certainly don’t think he’s a bad man or a lousy father just because he sent a photo of his junk, or a video of himself touching said junk, to women he was having sex with (or hoping to have sex with).With so much to be furious about right now, I want to make sure we’re not wasting our energy nor our indignation on people who, at the very least, may not be worthy of it. As cringeworthy as it might make us feel, we might even need to come to the defense of those who hold oppositional and unsavory political and social beliefs, if we conclude in this instance they aren’t in the wrong.There are plenty of reasons to take Barton to task ― I don’t like lawmakers who vote against the things I stand for or who want to stand in the way of me living my life the way I see fit ― but I’m also a big fan of (responsibly shared) dick pics and sex positivity. As despicable as I find someone like Barton, the enemy of my falsely pious, dangerously anti-sex enemies is my friend.Let Joe Barton be voted out of office because he supports and is supported by awful organizations with gruesome plans for America. If he’s forced out for simply being a horny old goat who shared a private jerk-off video with another adult, none of us win. What’s worse, it sets a(nother) precedent that posits sex ― even consensual, respectful sex ― as dirty, unhealthy and ultimately harmful not only to the individuals involved but also our society at large.In a year when women are finally being heard and believed about the assault and harassment they’ve experienced at men’s hands, we must commit ourselves to calling out and holding accountable those who harm others and try to repair our broken culture. But we also need to ensure that aren’t feeding the wrong individuals, for the wrong reasons, to the beautifully transformative bonfire we’ve finally lit.This piece has been updated."

Eruptions of smoke and steam that began Saturday have triggered the country’s highest level of alert. Although about 40,000 people were evacuated to shelters over the weekend, authorities are facing resistance from residents who want to stay behind to protect their homes and livestock.“Not all villagers in the dangerous radius are willing to evacuate,” the agency wrote. “Until now there are still many people who remain in their houses.”Airports were shut down for a second day as air conditions worsened. More than 400 flights have been canceled, and 59,000 travelers have been stranded, the BBC reported.Australian students who had just finished final exams and were prepared to fly home reported being denied aid from their travel insurance, according to The Australian Associated Press. Emily Martin, 19, on her first trip without her family, said she was worried about running out of money as she waited to go home.“They don’t really tell you that you’re not covered by the insurance for the volcano. You’re just left in the dark,” Martin told the AAP in Bali.Authorities warned that Mount Agung could violently erupt at any moment. Plumes of volcanic ash have risen nearly 5.6 miles into the air. Water and rock have streamed down Mount Agung, a mixture called lahar in Indonesian, that can damage the environment. "
