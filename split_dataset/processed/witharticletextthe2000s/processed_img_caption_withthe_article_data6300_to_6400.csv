0,QUEER VOICES,James Woods Goes After Anderson Cooper With Homophobic 'Butt Plug' Tweet,Noah Michelson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/james-woods-anderson-cooper-butt-plug_us_591710ace4b0fe039b34f194,The Oscar-nonimated actor chose a decidedly offensive way to express his displeasure with the CNN anchor.,2017-05-13,The Oscar-nominated actor often uses Twitter to share his conservative view points.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59171b511500001f00db223a.jpeg?cache=ZAnpeL272c&ops=crop_0_86_2190_1226%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"While much of the internet was celebrating Anderson Cooper responding to a statement made by Kellyanne Conway with a massive eye roll on Tuesday, one famous person had a very different reaction.James Woods sent a decidedly homophobic tweet on Thursday attributing Cooper’s theatrical response to Conway to the CNN anchor’s “butt plug dislodg[ing] during a newscast.”The senior Trump adviser appeared on Cooper’s show to talk about President Donald Trump firing FBI Director James Comey. At one point during the interview, Cooper and Conway got into a heated discussion about Trump’s actions during his campaign versus his actions as president. After Cooper played clips of several of Trump’s campaign speeches, including one from Michigan in October 2016, Conway responded, “Thanks for the trip down memory lane. You’re conflating two things that don’t belong together.”She then added, “I was on your show often last fall saying we were going to win Michigan and how we were going to do it,” which elicited the eye roll seen around the world from Cooper.Woods, an Oscar-nominated actor, frequently shares his conservative views via his Twitter feed.Conway had a different theory about Cooper’s response: sexism. “Let me tell you something, Hillary Clinton is in search of sexism as an excuse for why her disastrous candidacy and campaign lost six months ago,” she said on “Fox & Friends” Thursday. “I face sexism a lot of times when I show up for interviews like that. Could you imagine having a male anchor on a network roll eyes at Hillary Clinton or a female representative spokeswoman for President Obama or President Bill Clinton? I think not.”Correction: An earlier version of this story highlighted a different eye roll from Cooper (there were several made during his interview with Conway) than the one referenced by Woods. This has been fixed."
1,GREEN,Someone Illegally Shot A Rare White Wolf At Yellowstone National Park And Left It To Die,Mary Papenfuss,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/yellowstone-white-wolf-shot_us_59169e6ce4b0031e737dd867,"Hikers found the mortally wounded female, which had to be put down.",2017-05-13,White wolf tracks a scent in Yellowstone National Park.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5916b2441500002000db21fb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A $10,000 reward is being offered for information leading to the conviction of a gunman who shot and mortally wounded a rare white wolf in Yellowstone National Park.Hikers found the elderly alpha female abandoned in the woods near the northern boundary of the park near Gardiner, Montana, on April 11. They called for help, but she was so severely injured that she had to be euthanized.Necropsy results released Thursday show that the 12-year-old — who was twice as old as the average wolf in the park — had been shot with a rifle.“The death of this wolf is another tragic loss in the trend of illegally poaching iconic species,” said Jaimie Rappaport Clark, president and CEO of Defenders of Wildlife.“Yellowstone National Park’s wolves are unequivocally prized. These wolves are valued globally, and local communities reliant on tourism benefit significantly from their presence. Returning wolves to their natural habitat has a beneficial effect on the entire ecosystem.”The canine was one of three white wolves in the park. She was the alpha female of the Canyon Pack for more than nine years with the same alpha male, and had at least 20 pups. She was one of the most recognizable wolves in the park,Yellowstone offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of the killer or killers. The wildlife advocacy group the Wolves of the Rockies in Montana doubled the reward. Some conservationists believe the wolf was shot by someone angry about the reintroduction of the animals into the park 20 years ago — otherwise they would have likely taken the “trophy.”“People take matters into their own hands and feel they are above the law and they kind of flaunt that fact that they can do what they want to do and there’s no repercussions,” Wolves of the Rockies President Marc Cook told The Associated Press. There are now close to 100 wolves in the park, despite the complaints of many ranchers and hunters.It’s illegal to shoot animals in the park — or to discharge a firearm.Yellowstone accepts anonymous tips to its phone line at 888-653-0009. “You don’t have to tell them who you are, but please tell them what you know,” said the park statement. You can email information to nps_isb@nps.gov or submit it online at www.nps.gov/isb.The shooting upset many animal lovers who expressed their outrage on Twitter."

Some are blissfully unaware of the negativity they spread, while others seem to derive satisfaction from creating chaos. Dr. Travis Bradberry shows you who to avoid and how to keep your distance.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591345001500002400db1982.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Toxic people defy logic. Some are blissfully unaware of the negative impact that they have on those around them, and others seem to derive satisfaction from creating chaos and pushing other people’s buttons.As important as it is to learn how to deal with different kinds of people, truly toxic people will never be worth your time and energy—and they take a lot of each. Toxic people create unnecessary complexity, strife, and, worst of all, stress.“People inspire you, or they drain you—pick them wisely.” – Hans F. Hansen Recent research from Friedrich Schiller University in Germany shows just how serious toxic people are. They found that exposure to stimuli that cause strong negative emotions—the same kind of exposure you get when dealing with toxic people—caused subjects’ brains to have a massive stress response. Whether it’s negativity, cruelty, the victim syndrome, or just plain craziness, toxic people drive your brain into a stressed-out state that should be avoided at all costs.Stress can have a lasting, negative impact on the brain. Exposure to even a few days of stress compromises the effectiveness of neurons in the hippocampus, an important brain area responsible for reasoning and memory. Weeks of stress cause reversible damage to brain cells, and months of stress can permanently destroy them. Toxic people don’t just make you miserable—they’re really hard on your brain.The ability to manage your emotions and remain calm under pressure has a direct link to your performance. TalentSmart has conducted research with more than a million people, and we’ve found that 90% of top performers are skilled at managing their emotions in times of stress in order to remain calm and in control. One of their greatest gifts is the ability to identify toxic people and keep them at bay.It’s often said that you’re the product of the five people you spend the most time with. If you allow even one of those five people to be toxic, you’ll soon find out how capable he or she is of holding you back.You can’t hope to distance yourself from toxic people until you first know who they are. The trick is to separate those who are annoying or simply difficult from those who are truly toxic. What follows are ten types of toxic drainers that you should stay away from at all costs so that you don’t become one yourself.1. The Gossip“Great minds discuss ideas, average ones discuss events, and small minds discuss people.” – Eleanor RooseveltGossipers derive pleasure from other people’s misfortunes. It might be fun to peer into somebody else’s personal or professional faux pas at first, but over time, it gets tiring, makes you feel gross, and hurts other people. There are too many positives out there and too much to learn from interesting people to waste your time talking about the misfortune of others.2. The TemperamentalSome people have absolutely no control over their emotions. They will lash out at you and project their feelings onto you, all the while thinking that you’re the one causing their malaise. Temperamental people are tough to dump from your life because their lack of control over their emotions makes you feel bad for them. When push comes to shove though, temperamental people will use you as their emotional toilet and should be avoided at all costs.3. The VictimVictims are tough to identify because you initially empathize with their problems. But as time passes, you begin to realize that their “time of need” is all the time. Victims actively push away any personal responsibility by making every speed bump they encounter into an uncrossable mountain. They don’t see tough times as opportunities to learn and grow from; instead, they see them as an out. There’s an old saying: “Pain is inevitable but suffering is optional.” It perfectly captures the toxicity of the victim, who chooses to suffer every time.4. The Self-AbsorbedSelf-absorbed people bring you down through the impassionate distance they maintain from other people. You can usually tell when you’re hanging around self-absorbed people because you start to feel completely alone. This happens because as far as they’re concerned, there’s no point in having a real connection between them and anyone else. You’re merely a tool used to build their self-esteem.5. The EnviousTo envious people, the grass is always greener somewhere else. Even when something great happens to envious people, they don’t derive any satisfaction from it. This is because they measure their fortune against the world’s when they should be deriving their satisfaction from within. And let’s face it, there’s always someone out there who’s doing better if you look hard enough. Spending too much time around envious people is dangerous because they teach you to trivialize your own accomplishments.6. The ManipulatorManipulators suck time and energy out of your life under the façade of friendship. They can be tricky to deal with because they treat you like a friend. They know what you like, what makes you happy, and what you think is funny, but the difference is that they use this information as part of a hidden agenda. Manipulators always want something from you, and if you look back on your relationships with them, it’s all take, take, take, with little or no giving. They’ll do anything to win you over just so they can work you over.7. The DementorIn J. K. Rowling’s “Harry Potter” series, Dementors are evil creatures that suck people’s souls out of their bodies, leaving them merely as shells of humans. Whenever a Dementor enters the room, it goes dark, people get cold, and they begin to recall their worst memories. Rowling said that she developed the concept for Dementors based on highly negative people—the kind of people who have the ability to walk into a room and instantly suck the life out of it.Dementors suck the life out of the room by imposing their negativity and pessimism upon everyone they encounter. Their viewpoints are always glass half empty, and they can inject fear and concern into even the most benign situations. A Notre Dame University study found that students assigned to roommates who thought negatively were far more likely to develop negative thinking and even depression themselves.8. The TwistedThere are certain toxic people who have bad intentions, deriving deep satisfaction from the pain and misery of others. They are either out to hurt you, to make you feel bad, or to get something from you; otherwise, they have no interest in you. The only good thing about this type is that you can spot their intentions quickly, which makes it that much faster to get them out of your life.9. The JudgmentalJudgmental people are quick to tell you exactly what is and isn’t cool. They have a way of taking the thing you’re most passionate about and making you feel terrible about it. Instead of appreciating and learning from people who are different from them, judgmental people look down on others. Judgmental people stifle your desire to be a passionate, expressive person, so you’re best off cutting them out and being yourself.10. The ArrogantArrogant people are a waste of your time because they see everything you do as a personal challenge. Arrogance is false confidence, and it always masks major insecurities. A University of Akron study found that arrogance is correlated with a slew of problems in the workplace. Arrogant people tend to be lower performers, more disagreeable, and have more cognitive problems than the average person.How to Protect Yourself Once You Spot ‘EmToxic people drive you crazy because their behavior is so irrational. Make no mistake about it—their behavior truly goes against reason, so why do you allow yourself to respond to them emotionally and get sucked into the mix?The more irrational and off-base someone is, the easier it should be for you to remove yourself from their traps. Quit trying to beat them at their own game. Distance yourself from them emotionally, and approach your interactions with them like they’re a science project (or you’re their shrink if you prefer that analogy). You don’t need to respond to the emotional chaos—only the facts.Maintaining an emotional distance requires awareness. You can’t stop someone from pushing your buttons if you don’t recognize when it’s happening. Sometimes you’ll find yourself in situations where you’ll need to regroup and choose the best way forward. This is fine, and you shouldn’t be afraid to buy yourself some time to do so.Most people feel as though because they work or live with someone, they have no way to control the chaos. This couldn’t be further from the truth. Once you’ve identified a toxic person, you’ll begin to find their behavior more predictable and easier to understand. This will equip you to think rationally about when and where you have to put up with them and when and where you don’t. You can establish boundaries, but you’ll have to do so consciously and proactively. If you let things happen naturally, you’re bound to find yourself constantly embroiled in difficult conversations. If you set boundaries and decide when and where you’ll engage a difficult person, you can control much of the chaos. The only trick is to stick to your guns and keep boundaries in place when the person tries to cross them, which they will.Have you bumped into any of these types of toxic people?

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is hitting the road for Rob Quist, the banjo-playing Montana Democrat hoping to win the race for an open House seat on May 25, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5915ee841e00002800622be8.jpeg?cache=BunMaPlE7Y&ops=crop_0_194_3000_2316%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is barnstorming Montana for House Democratic candidate Rob Quist the weekend before the May 25 special election for the open House seat.Sanders declared his willingness to campaign for Quist in early April, and Quist and Sanders have been working out the timing of a visit since then.On Friday, the Quist campaign announced the dates of Sanders’ visits. The Vermont progressive will appear at rallies for Quist in Missoula, Butte, and Billings on May 20, and Bozeman on May 21.“I’m excited to have Bernie Sanders come to Big Sky Country to witness the grassroots support behind our campaign and share the message that we need more elected leaders fighting for working class families, instead of millionaires, corporations and special interests,” Rob Quist said in a statement. Quist, 69, is the banjo-playing founder of the popular Montana folk rock group Mission Mountain Wood Band. He’s running a populist campaign against Republican Greg Gianforte, a 56-year-old multimillionaire tech company founder originally from New Jersey. The national Democratic Party initially shied away from Quist’s bid, apparently viewing it as too much of a longshot. In recent weeks, however, the party has started to invest heavily in the race. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee doubled its contribution to Quist with an injection of $400,000, and the Democratic National Committee has, among other things, mobilized its sizable email list to raise additional funds for him.Nonetheless, Quist, who backed Sanders in the presidential primary, turned down a visit to the state from DNC Chair Tom Perez.There are signs that Republicans believe the race is tightening as well. Donald Trump Jr. hit the campaign trail for Gianforte this week, the second such visit from the president’s son. Vice President Mike Pence is also scheduled to stump for the Republican contender in Billings on Friday.On the campaign trail, Quist has emphasized his support for preserving Montana’s federally protected public lands and fighting for affordable health care.He is trying to capitalize on Gianforte’s vacillation on the Obamacare repeal bill passed in the House of Representatives last week. Last Thursday, Gianforte publicly declined to take a position on the American Health Care Act, as the bill is known. But in a private call with lobbyists obtained by The New York Times, Gianforte said he was “thankful for” the bill’s passage.Last weekend, Gianforte tried to walk it back.“I’ve been very clear, to repeal and replace ‘Obamacare’ we must have guarantees here in Montana that rates will go down, rural access will be preserved and people with pre-existing conditions will be protected,” Gianforte told local CBS affiliate KPAX. “If I didn’t have that assurance I would have voted against it.”Gianforte’s flip-flopping was a windfall for Quist, who raised $500,000 off the incident over the course of four days. His campaign has raised $3.8 million total with an average donation of $25.Gianforte leads Quist by 6 percentage points in a poll released May 5 that was conducted for a Democratic super PAC. A late April Emerson College poll showed Quist trailing by 15 percentage points."
6,POLITICS,ESPN Reporters Say They're Not Going To 'Stick To Sports',Travis Waldron,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/espn-not-sticking-to-sports_us_5914d86be4b0031e737c6848,ESPN is emphasizing its commitment to journalism by rebooting two popular shows. Covering political and social issues will be a part of those efforts.,2017-05-12,"Jeremy Schaap and Bob Ley visit at SiriusXM Studios on May 9, 2017 in New York City.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5914e4d41500001f00db1e71.jpeg?ops=crop_9_60_2173_1174%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"After another round of layoffs hit top talent at ESPN late last month, conservative pundits were quick to blame the company’s struggles on its perceived slide into liberalism. The network’s coverage of athletes like Michael Sam, the first openly gay football player ever selected in the NFL draft, and Colin Kaepernick, the 49ers quarterback who knelt in protest during the national anthem throughout the 2016 season, supposedly turned off conservative viewers who want ESPN’s coverage to just “stick to sports.”But Jeremy Schaap and Bob Ley, two of the network’s longest-tenured television reporters and news hosts, say that won’t work in the modern world of sports. Ley, who has worked at ESPN since its inception in 1979, even sees a tinge of hypocrisy in the criticism that the company is “too political.” The host of the popular “Outside The Lines” program, which focuses on deeper coverage of sports issues beyond the playing field, said it wasn’t long ago when sports fans and pundits wanted athletes to be more aware of the world around them.Ten years ago, people were screaming, “Hey, where are the athletes who care? Who is the next [Muhammad] Ali? When is Michael Jordan going to speak up about the conditions making his sneakers in Vietnam?” Ley said in a recent interview.Ley believes ESPN naturally skews liberal ― largely because it was founded in Connecticut ― and he has said in previous interviews that the company could use more “ideological diversity.” But “there’s no cabal,” he said, adding that the network’s reporters are capable of covering political issues comprehensively and fairly.Conservatives’ perceptions of ESPN’s politics may come from the outspokenness of some of the network’s reporters, analysts and personalities on social media. But the company is also aiming to maintain its place as, in Schaap’s words, “the source of record on sports news.” And from a journalistic perspective, that requires covering stories like Sam’s and Kaepernick’s, which bridge the gaps between sports, politics and social issues ― especially as those subjects become increasingly intertwined.“Our country has become a lot more politicized over the last year and a half, two years, than it has been in a long time,” Schaap said. “Sports has become a lot more politicized in the last three or four years than it has been in the past. That’s a story we’ve covered: the engagement of athletes.”“The idea that we’re talking too much about Colin Kaepernick seems wrongheaded to me. It was arguably the biggest off-field NFL story of last fall. How are you not going to talk about it?” asked Schaap, who came to ESPN in 1993 and is the lead host of “E:60,” a televised news magazine program. “What kind of political decision would it be to say, ‘We’re not going to cover Colin Kaepernick’s protests?’”Some journalists and media observers have also questioned ESPN’s commitment to rigorous and ambitious sports reporting amid the layoffs, since many of the employees who lost jobs last month were high-profile journalists.But the company’s executives insist ESPN remains committed to sports reporting, and Schaap and Ley may be the best evidence they have to support that argument.Starting this weekend, Schaap will reboot “E:60,” which is known for its deep reporting but has bounced around without a set timeslot for years. Now it will air every Sunday morning and share a new studio with Ley’s “Outside The Lines,” which will remain in its daily afternoon slot. “Outside the Lines” is also re-branding with a new look and format, and Ley and his reporting team will contribute to “E:60.”The layoffs didn’t miss the two shows entirely, since multiple ESPN reporters who often contributed to “Outside The Lines” reporting projects lost their jobs. But revamping the shows reflects ESPN’s “redoubling” on the sort of journalism “E:60” has done since it began a decade ago, Schaap said.“I think it says that we are, more than ever, committed to doing journalism that matters, journalism that is expensive, that isn’t always necessarily about getting the most eyeballs but serves the audience,” Schaap said.The new “E:60” will mix human interest stories ― like an upcoming feature on Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott ― with investigative reporting. Some of ESPN’s most accomplished reporters will participate, and Ley said that ESPN executives have assured the duo that they have the company’s full commitment.The opening episode will feature a nine-month reporting project covering the Syrian national soccer team’s attempt to qualify for the 2018 World Cup even as the country remains embroiled in a complex and brutal civil war.The story features interviews with players who are now refugees and explores the fact that “The Dictator’s Team,” as the episode is titled, “represents a government accused of committing war crimes against its own people, and soccer is woven into [Syrian President Bashar Assad’s] grisly campaign of state-sponsored oppression,” ESPN said in a release.This may be a sign of ESPN’s journalistic ambition, but it also shows that the network is willing to pursue stories that intersect with deep and divisive global political issues, just as it did in the past.“I was at the Barclays Center when LeBron James decided to wear the ‘I Can’t Breathe’ t-shirt,” Schaap said. He came to the Brooklyn arena that night in 2014 to cover a visit from Prince William, but James’ unexpected decision to join NBA-wide protests over the death of Eric Garner ― an African-American man killed by an NYPD officer ― forced him to focus on a contentious political issue instead.“News broke out,” he said. “What were we supposed to do, not talk about it?”"

In a series of tweets, the president said his country was focusing “all its efforts to prevent the extinction of the species.”Peña Nieto’s reply represents one of the most high profile pledges to save the animal, which has seen population numbers plummet from about 60 to just 30 in the past year.The WWF launched a campaign this week to urge the Mexican president to address the increasingly dire threat faced by the vaquita, saying there was still time to save the few that remain.Researchers have been scrambling to save the elusive porpoise, which has seen populations fall by 90 percent in the past five years.The animals are continually threatened by illegal fishing operations and often find themselves trapped in gill nets used to catch a critically endangered fish called the totoaba. The totoaba’s swim bladder is considered a delicacy in parts of Asia, where it’s known as “aquatic cocaine” that can sell for as much as $10,000 a kilogram.The Mexican government has thrown vast support behind a research group called CIRVA, or the Committee for the Recovery of the Vaquita, in an effort to halt the fisheries, including a two-year emergency ban on gill nets in the area. However, that ban expired in April.Scientists with the agency have also proposed a dramatic plan to capture and breed several vaquitas in an attempt to stave off their extinction. The only problem: No one has ever caught a vaquita alive.Peña Nieto noted on Twitter that the government has more than “300 marines, 15 boats and unmanned aircraft systems” watching over the vaquita’s habitat, and protection zones have expanded to “three times larger than the original.”But the conservation group Sea Shepherd, which has been patrolling the region with the support of Mexico, has continued to recover illegal totoaba nets throughout the Gulf of California. The group found the body of yet another dead vaquita in March.“Witnessing one of the few remaining vaquita in the entire world dead and floating in front of our ship was devastating to my crew,” Luisa Albera, captain of Sea Shepherd’s ‘Farley Mowat,’ wrote at the time.Despite the ongoing threats faced by the porpoise, Peña Nieto said the Mexican government was making “a major effort” to save them, and doing “what should have been done decades ago.”"
8,THE WORLDPOST,Central American Refugees Fleeing Violence Are 'Re-Victimized' En Route To U.S.,Jesselyn Cook,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/refugees-migrants-mexico-central-america_us_59149f36e4b066b421723ec8,"For millions of migrants, ""fear and horrific violence... is a reality that does not end with their forced flight to Mexico.”",2017-05-12,"Honduran migrants warm themselves next to a campfire in Sonora, Mexico, on Jan. 13, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5915ed271500002000db207b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"“They put a knife on my neck, so I did not resist,” said a refugee woman from Honduras, describing her alleged abduction and rape en route to North America. “I am ashamed to say this, but I think it would have been better if they had killed me.” The unnamed 35-year-old was attempting to reach Mexico for the fourth time when she was seized by “a group of delinquents” aided by federal police, she told Doctors Without Borders, also known as Médecins Sans Frontières. They handed her over to gang members, who abused her, she said.These kinds of stories are “painfully normal,” MSF’s U.S. executive director, Jason Cone, said Thursday at a press event to launch the group’s latest report.Hundreds of thousands of people cross into Mexico each year, according to the United Nations, many of whom are headed toward the U.S. from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, a group of countries known as the Northern Triangle of Central America. Canada, meanwhile, has also become a common destination for asylum seekers fleeing through Mexico from the NTCA and other crisis-afflicted regions of the world. Canadian immigration officials have observed a recent surge of asylum claims and illegal border crossings from the U.S. “For millions of people from the NTCA region, trauma, fear and horrific violence are dominant facets of daily life,” MSF reports. “Yet it is a reality that does not end with their forced flight to Mexico.”The humanitarian medical organization spent two years gathering information and interviewing hundreds of migrants and refugees to document how people fleeing danger and violence in the NTCA are “re-victimized” along the northern transit route.The findings were grim. Sixty-eight percent said they had been victims of violence in Mexico, and almost one-third of the women reported being sexually abused. Their assailants allegedly included gang members and members of the Mexican security forces, migrants told MSF. “Many of those making their way to Mexico through the Northern Triangle have been terrorized,” Cone said. “We need measures to protect these people, not push them into the arms of people who are smuggling them.”But the U.S. and Mexico’s heightened immigration enforcement, including the use of detention and deportation, threatens do just that, MSF warns in its report.Despite the extreme levels of violence and homicide in El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, the number of related asylum grants in the U.S. and Mexico remains low. Last year, the Mexican government deported 141,990 people originally from the NTCA.“This is an overwhelming crisis. It requires not only for the Mexican government to adhere to its own laws and international laws, but for the U.S. and Canadian government to be partners to the solution,” Cone said Thursday. “No person should be sent back to a country where they fear persecution or death.” "

Tom Newell, a Republican, resigned in November to join a conservative think tank.Barnes distinguished himself in the special election partly through his response to a scandal surrounding the resignation of another Republican state representative.Former Republican state Rep. Dan Kirby of Oklahoma’s 75th District resigned in February after a former legislative assistant accused him of sexual harassment.In his campaign for the 28th District, Barnes spoke up against the Republican leadership in the state House for approving the use of taxpayer funds to pay out a legal settlement to Kirby’s accuser.Democrat Karen Gaddis and Republican Tressa Nunley are due to square off for Kirby’s old seat in a July 11 special election.Special elections are widely viewed as an early test of the political backlash to Trump’s presidency. HuffPost has created a visual tool to track how Democrats are faring in these races by comparing how Democrats perform in a given contest with Hillary Clinton’s margin against Trump.CORRECTION: This article previously stated two former legislative assistants accused former Rep. Dan Kirby of sexual harassment. It has been updated to reflect the complaint was filed by one former legislative assistant.This article previously stated that Barnes was competing to fill Dan Kirby’s seat, when in fact the special election was for a legislative post previously occupied by Tom Newell."

John Kasich’s GOP presidential primary campaign last year. He added that Trump deserves all the criticism he is getting. “All of it is crazy and not sustainable, and the country can’t take it 24-7. ... It’s like Nixon with an open mic. It’s just unbelievable.”Nevertheless, the silence from most elected Republicans is likely to continue, Weaver and other GOP political operatives said, until Trump’s behavior starts affecting the prospects of individual officeholders to keep their jobs.“I don’t think that’s going to occur until they sit down with their pollsters in the latter part of the year ― when the ‘there’s no-interest-like-self-interest-rule’ takes effect,” Weaver said.Trump’s personal approval numbers are already historically low for such an early point in a first term, with a majority of Americans believing he is doing a bad job on every major issue. And Trump’s unpopularity is already affecting “generic” congressional ballot polling, in which voters are asked whether they prefer a Democratic or Republican member of Congress. Republicans currently hold a 45-seat majority in the House, but Democrats hold a 6-point edge in the generic polling.“It will take the generic ballot and individual members realizing they’re upside down in their own polls,” said Rick Tyler, who worked on Texas Sen. Ted Cruz’s campaign last year.Tyler and Weaver, of course, are in the relatively small minority of Republicans who have opposed Trump continuously from the time of the Republican presidential primary. Most other Republicans who were against Trump during the primary came around to back him by the general election.That group includes most members of the Republican National Committee, which Trump essentially now leads as president.“The left keeps underestimating the man who is now president,” said one longtime member, who spoke to HuffPost on the condition he not be named. He added that Trump “clearly enjoys organized chaos.”But even within the RNC, Trump’s latest controversies are starting to sow disquiet. “Sure,” said another longstanding member who asked not to be identified, when asked whether Trump’s actions and remarks about ex-FBI director James Comey are worrisome.He, nevertheless, is comforted that the midterm elections are a long way off, and that Trump’s poll numbers, despite everything, haven’t fallen off a cliff.“Tension will, however, increase in direct proportion to the proximity to the 2018 election,” he said. “Thirty-five (percent approval) in July of 2017 is different than 35 in July of 2018.”Weaver, though, said Republicans should remember that Trump’s current job-approval numbers of around 40 percent don’t have much room to fall. “Richard Nixon still had the support of 28 percent of the American people the day he resigned,” Weaver said."

Wearing baseball hats, hair nets and face masks, chefs in white uniforms stand around stainless steel tables rapidly rolling, weighing and wrapping thousands of dumplings every single day.If the kitchen looks more like a sterile surgical theater, that’s somewhat intentional –- the company is obsessed with cleanliness, efficiency and perhaps most of all, precision.For the uninitiated, Din Tai Fung is well known for serving golf-ball sized buns filled with juicy minced pork, known as xiaolongbao, among other dim sum dishes.The restaurant first opened in Taipei, Taiwan in the 1970s when founder Yang Bing-yi started serving them at his cooking oil shop to subsidize his failing retail business.By 1993, The New York Times named Din Tai Fung one of the 10 best restaurants in the world. That led to expansion in Japan, then Hong Kong, one Michelin star at two separate locations, and now 136 franchised branches worldwide.Many say the Taiwan-based chain has created the world’s international standard for xiaolongbao. But the ones Din Tai Fung sell today differ from the original, which are said to be from Nanxiang, a town on the fringes of Shanghai, China.“Local chefs became known for their take on the “soup buns’’ (”tang bao”) that are found in various forms all over the Jiangnan or Lower Yangtze region,” said Chinese cuisine expert Fuchsia Dunlop, author of Land of Fish and Rice: Recipes from the Culinary Heart of China.“In the early 20th century, one Nanxiang man opened a snack shop near the City God Temple in the center of Shanghai specializing in his hometown’s most famous delicacy, and that’s really where the cult begins,” Dunlop added.The food is steeped in Shanghai’s culinary and cultural history. In 2006, Shanghai’s government added xiao long bao to its list of the city’s “protected traditional treasures.”The main difference is in the dough. Din Tai Fung uses a paper-thin wrapper filled with hot, juicy minced pork that make customers wonder how the dumplings don’t prematurely burst while cooking.But that precision is exactly why Din Tai Fung has grown to be so famous. The company streamlined a finicky dumpling and made it taste reliably great every single time it’s ordered. “What Din Tai Fung has done has been to apply meticulous standardization to its xiaolongbao,” Dunlop says. That standardization begins in the kitchen.At the Hong Kong branch located in Kowloon’s Mira Mall, chefs make 2000 xiaolongbao every weekday, and 3500 every weekend, which amounts to 17,000 pork soup dumplings every week. This number doesn’t include the other dumplings and dim sum offerings on the menu. And some of Din Tai Fung’s more frequented locations sell even more.The dim sum kitchen is separated from the restaurant’s main kitchen by a short hallway. The area is divided into four sections: dough production, steaming basket arrangement, dim sum production and steaming section.After the dough is cut and formed into small balls and weighed for accuracy, a chef rolls out the dough to create small circular wrappers, which are passed over to another chef, who adds the filling and weighs the dumpling once more. The filling is a mixture of minced pork, seasonings and a super gelatinous soup that goes from jelly to liquid form once the dumpling is steamed.Then, the dumpling is passed to the chef who wraps the xiaolongbao in a matter of seconds with 18 exquisite folds. Some say there are 18 folds because the number is considered lucky in Chinese culture. Din Tai Fung says that after continuous testing, they found that 18 folds is the golden ratio of making the perfect xiaolongbao.Once a bamboo basket is filled with six xiaolongbao, it’s passed over to the final section for steaming, which looks like a massive stovetop with geyser-like holes from which steam shoots out. Baskets are placed over the holes to cook.Din Tai Fung says the steaming area is considered the most difficult and well-regarded position, since the chefs have to arrange and manage various types of dim sum with different cooking times. They’re also the last guard of quality inspection before food goes out to customers.It comes as no surprise that making it as a chef at Din Tai Fung is no easy task, and requires undergoing constant evaluation. “Our chefs have to keep on training and testing in every stage,” a spokesperson for the restaurant told HuffPost. “They would test on every three months. If [they] fail, they have to keep on training at the same stage until they pass. We believe that practice makes perfect.”Brian Hwarng, an Associate Professor of Decision Sciences at National University of Singapore Business School, said he spent 18 months observing Din Tai Fung’s top management at the company’s Taipei headquarters. In a case study, he wrote that Din Tai Fung staff are required to keep a daily work journal “not to monitor sales or targets but to serve as a basis for company-wide learning and continuous improvement.” Hwarng also wrote that about half of the revenue from the company’s Taiwan operation go towards staff training and benefits.The company announced plans to open its first franchise in London sometime this year, which will be the chain’s first entrance into the European market.While folks on the west coast of the U.S. can dine at one of 10 locations in California and Seattle, Washington, those in the rest of the country will have to travel to get their fix.For a taste of Din Tai Fung, New Yorkers can head to Manhattan’s SoHo neighborhood to eat at the recently opened Pinch Chinese, which is led by former Din Tai Fung executive chef, Charlie Chen.But for xiaolongbao fanatics, a trip to Shanghai, Taipei and Hong Kong should be on the agenda next."

Attitudes about the media’s “watchdog” role are polarized to a record extent. And the Census has new information about who voted in 2016 ― too bad it doesn’t have a director any more. This is HuffPollster for Friday, May 12, 2017.SURVEY FINDS SPLIT OPINIONS ABOUT TRUMP’S FIRING OF JAMES COMEY - HuffPollster: “Americans are split over President Donald Trump’s decision to fire James Comey as the director of the FBI, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov survey, although few trust the Trump administration’s official explanation for the termination. A third of Americans say that Trump made the right decision, the poll finds, while 34 percent say he made the wrong decision. Although the vast majority of Americans, 85 percent, say they’ve heard at least some news about the firing, they’re not all sure what to think about it. A full third of the public says that they’re unsure….47 percent believe that Trump fired Comey at least partially to disrupt the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether any Trump campaign associates colluded with Russia. Just 26 percent think the firing was unrelated to the investigation….The level of polarization, while not unusual in the response to a political controversy, suggests that the concerns of some Republican senators over Comey’s firing haven’t trickled down to their base.” [HuffPost] How that stacks up to other polls: More from HuffPollster: “The results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey closely match those of a Politico/Morning Consult poll also released Thursday, which found that 35 percent of voters thought Trump was right to remove Comey, 33 percent that he should have allowed Comey to continue and 32 percent unsure. A third poll from NBC and SurveyMonkey, however, found a similar level of support for the firing but far higher opposition, with 38 percent of Americans calling the dismissal appropriate and 54 percent saying it was inappropriate. There’s one major difference between that survey and the other two. The NBC/SurveyMonkey poll didn’t provide respondents with an explicit option to say they were undecided, although they were allowed to skip the question. The HuffPost/YouGov and Politico/Morning Consult polls gave people an option to say that they weren’t sure.”More from NBC/SurveyMonkey - Hannah Hartig, John Lapinski and Stephanie Perry: “A majority of Americans (54 percent) agree that allegations of improper contact with Russian government officials by Trump campaign advisers represent a serious issue that should be investigated. Four in ten think the allegations are more of a distraction….Among those Americans who say that the allegations are a serious issue, 83 percent are less confident that the Russian investigation will be conducted fairly after Comey’s unexpected firing.” [NBC]More from Politico/Morning Consult - Steven Shepard: “Overall, 37 percent of voters describe Trump’s decision to remove Comey as ‘appropriate,’ and 34 percent describe it as ‘inappropriate.’...Asked whether Trump’s decision was appropriate in light of the investigation into his campaign, however, the percentage who say it was appropriate does not change measurably, ticking down a single point to 36 percent. But the percentage who say it was inappropriate rises 7 percentage points, to 41 percent….Told that Comey ‘misstated several details’ about the Clinton investigation, 47 percent say Trump’s decision was appropriate, including 29 percent of Democrats. Just 28 percent say it is inappropriate in light of those misstatements.” [Politico] THE NEWS ON RUSSIA AND TRUMP IS EVOLVING, BUT OPINIONS ARE NOT - HuffPollster, on a survey taken after Monday’s Senate hearings on Russia, but largely before the Tuesday-night firing of James Comey as FBI director: “Public opinion on the United States’ relationship with Russia has barely budged over the last several weeks, despite a series of congressional hearings about the Kremlin’s possible interference in the 2016 election and the Donald Trump administration’s connections to Moscow. Americans currently say, 43 percent to 30 percent, that the Trump administration’s relationship with Russia is a legitimate issue, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov survey. Forty-seven percent consider that relationship to be at least a somewhat serious problem, although only 29 percent believe it to be very serious….All those numbers are similar to those from a March poll taken just after the FBI confirmed it was investigating possible ties between Trump associates and Russian government officials….What’s striking about the results ― and a main factor in their stability ― is how deeply entrenched views remain along partisan lines.” [HuffPost, more from 538’s Nate Silver on how to know if the issue is gaining momentum]POLLS FIND LITTLE SUPPORT FOR NEW GOP HEALTH CARE BILL - A HuffPost/YouGov survey published Monday found just 31 percent of Americans in favor of the bill, with 44 percent opposed. Since then, several other pollsters have weighed in, with similar results. [HuffPost, Economist, Morning Consult, Quinnipiac]Could the vote help Democrats? - Kyle Kondik: “Democrats are hopeful that Republicans’ vote last week to pass the American Health Care Act provides them an argument to use in next year’s election. Only 20 House Republicans voted against the bill, which is not polling well and which Democrats are angling to use as a cudgel against the GOP….All we can say right now is that Democrats paid a political price for drawn-out attempts to alter the American health care system in both the 1994 midterm, when their health care efforts failed, and in 2010, when their efforts resulted in the Affordable Care Act (’Obamacare’). It’s not crazy to suggest Republicans will also discover that taking ownership of health care could be bad for them, too, but it’s also not a certainty. Still, the case for GOP health care troubles rests upon a broader theory about the American public, which is that the public is resistant to dramatic change and is inherently skeptical of the party in power, particularly if it views that party as overreaching….We think the combination of a controversial and unpopular health care bill, a president with approval ratings that are poor, and the general tendency for the president’s party to struggle in the midterm is a recipe for potential Democratic success.” [Center for Politics]ATTITUDES ABOUT THE NEWS MEDIA DIVIDE ALONG PARTISAN LINES - Michael Barthel and Amy Mitchell: “Democrats and Republicans, who already tend to place their trust in different news sources and rely on different outlets for political news, now disagree more than ever on a fundamental issue of the news media’s role in society: whether news organizations’ criticism of political leaders primarily keeps them from doing things they shouldn’t – or keeps them from doing their job. Today, in the early days of the Trump administration, roughly nine-in-ten Democrats (89%) say news media criticism keeps leaders in line (sometimes called the news media’s ‘watchdog role’), while only about four-in-ten Republicans (42%) say the same….While Republicans have been more likely to support a watchdog role during Democratic presidencies and vice versa, the distance between the parties has never approached the 47-point gap that exists today.” [Pew] WHAT THE CENSUS TELLS US ABOUT 2016 TURNOUT - Jens Manuel Krogstad and Mark Hugo Lopez: “A record 137.5 million Americans voted in the 2016 presidential election, according to new data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Overall voter turnout – defined as the share of adult U.S. citizens who cast ballots – was 61.4% in 2016, a share similar to 2012 but below the 63.6% who say they voted in 2008. A number of long-standing trends in presidential elections either reversed or stalled in 2016, as black voter turnout decreased, white turnout increased and the nonwhite share of the U.S. electorate remained flat since the 2012 election….The black voter turnout rate declined for the first time in 20 years in a presidential election, falling to 59.6% in 2016 after reaching a record-high 66.6% in 2012….Blacks, Hispanics, Asians and other racial or ethnic minorities accounted for 26.7% of voters in 2016, a share unchanged from 2012….The voter turnout rate increased among Millennials and those in Generation X….The voter turnout rate among women was 63.3% in 2016, mostly unchanged from 63.7% in 2012.” [Pew]More on the turnout estimates - Ted Mellnik, John Muyskens, Kim Soffen and Scott Clement: “White working-class people were no more likely to vote in this presidential election than in the previous one. Trump’s victory was not due to a spike in turnout among his base supporters. But there were significant changes in turnout among other demographics. Significant drops in black and Hispanic turnout may have cost Hillary Clinton some previously blue states. These estimates of voter turnout in the 2016 election came Wednesday from the Census Bureau, which surveyed about a hundred thousand people across the nation, providing the most comprehensive examination of who voted and didn’t….White people without college degrees turned out at just under 58 percent, less than a percentage point higher than in 2012. The group did break strongly for Trump — 66 percent compared with Romney’s 61 according to the network exit poll — a big contributor to Trump’s victory. But the Census data suggest Trump did not inspire a major surge in turnout among his signature demographic.” [WashPost]SPEAKING OF THE CENSUS... - Michael McAuliff: “The director of the U.S. Census Bureau is resigning, the Commerce Department announced Tuesday, leaving the government’s lead statistical agency without a clear leader as the bureau ramps up for the massive decennial task of counting the entire U.S. population in 2020. Census Bureau Director John Thompson’s announcement that he is leaving at the end of June comes less than a week after he testified on Capitol Hill, telling House appropriators that his agency would be able to carry out the Census effectively, despite a number of cost overruns and a lower budget than normal for this point in the 10-year planning cycle. Normally as Census planning shifts from the seventh year of the decade to the eighth, the budget jumps dramatically. But Congress did not pass the Obama administration’s budget for 2017, leaving the bureau about $160 million short of its $1.61 billion request. The Trump administration’s request for 2018 is essentially flatlined, at a time when the government is usually adding hundreds of millions of dollars to carry out one of the most challenging statistical counts in the world….No successor was announced, and the deputy director’s position is currently vacant.” [HuffPost]The American Association for Public Opinion Research, in a statement: “We urge the President to appoint a replacement of equal caliber. We are also greatly concerned that congressional and White House budget allocations for 2020 Census preparations are inadequate for the task at hand. While important that President Trump quickly appoints a new Census Bureau Director, it is equally critical that the new Director is given the resources necessary to deliver a methodologically rigorous and highly credible 2020 Census. Our entire nation is counting on it.” [AAPOR] AMERICANS HOLD RECORD LIBERAL VIEWS ON MANY MORAL ISSUES - Jeffrey M. Jones: “Americans continue to express an increasingly liberal outlook on what is morally acceptable, as their views on 10 of 19 moral issues that Gallup measures are the most left-leaning or permissive they have been to date. The percentages of U.S. adults who believe birth control, divorce, sex between unmarried people, gay or lesbian relations, having a baby outside of marriage, doctor-assisted suicide, pornography and polygamy are morally acceptable practices have tied record highs or set new ones this year. At the same time, record lows say the death penalty and medical testing on animals are morally acceptable.” [Gallup]HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this update every Tuesday and Friday morning via email!

Obama sat down with Sam Kass, the former White House chef and senior advisor for nutrition policy, in Washington, D.C., on Friday for the Partnership for a Healthier America summit to address childhood obesity. And she took aim at President Donald Trump’s policies. “This is where you really have to look at motives,” she said. “You really have to stop and think, ‘Why don’t you want our kids to have good food at school? What is wrong with you and why is that a partisan issue?’ Why would that be political? What is going on?” Access to healthy school lunches was the former first lady’s focus while in the White House, and Trump’s administration has been rolling back those efforts. The Obamas took some time for themselves after Trump’s inauguration in January, inking book deals, vacationing and just generally living their best lives. But they’re back and they’re not going anywhere. “We’re not gone, we’re just breathing, y’all. Let us breathe,” Obama insisted, per People magazine. “We’ve got to get our new lives set up.”“When you hear me getting riled up in this chair, it’s not politics, it’s parenting that’s really moving me,” she said, adding that everyone needs to “put aside our politics ... to not be cynical ... to not give up.”She’s certainly not.“You’ve got me as a partner as long as I can be of use,” she said. “So the question for you is, where do you want me? Just let me know and I’ll be here.”"

Asked Thursday and Friday what they planned to do about it and how they would get answers to their questions, Republican senators offered a collective “meh.”Most pointed to the ongoing work of the FBI probing Trump’s Russia ties, as well as the slow-moving probe by the Senate Intelligence Committee.But few seemed at all interested in doing anything new to shed light on something that last happened when the top two Justice Department officials resigned instead of following President Richard Nixon’s orders to fire the man investigating him.Sen. Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.), the chairman of the Budget Committee, figured he’d leave such questions to others.“I’m not on the intel committee,” Enzi said. “I’m working on health reform, I’m working on tax reform, I’m working on the 2018 budget. I’ll listen to my colleagues.”One who might have a more specific interest is Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, which oversees the FBI.He also would prefer to listen to his fellow senators, telling reporters Thursday he’d have to talk to colleagues first to decide whether the committee should bring in Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to explain the firing. It was Rosenstein who wrote one of the key justifications cited by Trump.“I haven’t talked to Rosenstein,” Grassley said. “If Rosenstein wants to talk to me or I feel a need to talk to him, I’ll talk to him.”(On Friday afternoon, Grassley and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, sent a letter to Rosenstein and acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe asking them to brief their committee on the FBI investigation into Russian interference.)Perhaps the most common response is the one Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) offered — the firing and conflicting messages from the administration about it don’t warrant any new action beyond the investigation that the FBI and the congressional intelligence committees already are carrying out.“I think the investigation has to play out. Follow the facts. Follow the facts and get the answers,” said Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), a former chairman of the Intelligence Committee.Even Republicans who have been highly critical of Trump don’t think Trump’s firing of Comey merits any fresh action from them.Senators such has Arizona’s Jeff Flake and Nebraska’s Ben Sasse went on NPR on successive days to lambaste the firing, but neither has embraced Democrats’ call to remove all doubt surrounding the independence of the Russian probe by appointing an independent prosecutor.Like McConnell, they say let the Senate committee — which lacks any prosecutorial power ― do its work.Sasse, for instance, said on Friday, “I’m open to that deliberation as we go forward because I think that would be a vote of no confidence in the Senate Intelligence Committee’s investigation.”Another GOP Trump critic, Sen. John McCain (Ariz.), has called for a congressional select committee to take over the probe. Despite criticizing Comey’s heave-ho, McCain, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee and sits on the intelligence panel, still argued Thursday that an independent prosecutor should wait.“I wouldn’t outright reject any notion, but the first priority is a select committee,” McCain said. “That, in my view, has worked in the past. Many times in the past, the wrong person is selected as a special prosecutor, and it has turned into a debacle.”McCain admitted that he saw no momentum for the creation of a select committee among his fellow Republicans.One simple way to extract some accountability for the firing — or at least throw a penalty flag — would be to insist that the administration take every possible step to show its choice to replace Comey would be independent.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) has suggested that Attorney General Jeff Sessions recuse himself from that process, since Sessions also had contacts with Russians that he did not initially disclose.Grassley didn’t entirely rule it out, but left the decision to Sessions.“What I would do is I would go by what the ethics people in the Justice Department say about that. Because that’s kind of the gold standard on recusal,” the Judiciary Committee chairman said.The odds seem long for even that much reprisal for Trump’s disposal of Comey, however. While Schumer called for Sessions to stay out of picking a new director, Feinstein dismissed the idea.“I don’t want to get into that,” Feinstein said. “My interest is who the individual is. Is he a good person for the job, or is he not? And that’s my interest.”McCain argued that Trump is already paying a price ― in the press.“It has erupted in all the major publications and means of communication in America,” McCain said.This article has been updated with information about a letter sent from the top members of the Senate Judiciary Committee to Rod Rosenstein and Andrew McCabe."
17,THE WORLDPOST,Scientists May Be ‘Vastly’ Underestimating The Extinction Risk Facing Some Species,Dominique Mosbergen,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/species-extinction-risk_us_59141a85e4b00b643ebb3934,A new Columbia University study is challenging the accuracy of methods used by the IUCN to determine conservation status.,2017-05-12,"The Malabar grey hornbill is considered a species of ""least concern"" by the conservation group IUCN.

In 2016, tens of thousands of mammals, birds, insects, plants and other organisms were found to be under threat from extinction, according to the list. Of that number, more than 5,000 were considered critically endangered, including iconic species like the leatherback turtle, the Antarctic blue whale, and both subspecies of orangutan — all creatures right at the precipice of vanishing forever.But as staggering as those numbers may sound, they may still be vast underestimates, according to a recent study out of Columbia University that challenged the accuracy of methods used by the International Union for Conservation of Nature to determine the status of species.  Specifically, the researchers concluded that the IUCN has been “systematically overestimating” the size of the habitat in which species can thrive ― errors that have possibly led to an underestimation of the number of organisms under threat of extinction worldwide. Those already listed as threatened by the IUCN may also be closer to extinction than we realize, the study said.  The research team, led by Don Melnick, a professor of conservation biology, came to these conclusions after assessing the IUCN Red List conservation status of 18 bird species endemic to the Western Ghats mountain chain of southwest India. In the paper, published in the June edition of the journal Biological Conservation, the scientists said the IUCN had  “vastly” overestimated the geographic range sizes for 17 of the 18 birds. Geographic range is one of the most basic criteria used by the IUCN to determine the level of threat facing a species; by overestimating range for most of the birds in question, therefore, inaccuracies emerged in some of IUCN’s assessments, the researchers said. The study proposed that at least 10 of the 18 birds should have their IUCN threat levels elevated. The grassland-dwelling Nilgiri pipit, for example, which is currently listed as “vulnerable” by the IUCN should be considered “endangered,” the researchers said, while the status of the large-beaked Malabar grey hornbill, now listed as a species of “least concern,” should be elevated to “near-threatened.” “In the first case, the pipit, which has a narrow, highly fragmented range, our estimates of that range are one-tenth to one-fortieth of what IUCN estimates,” Melnick said in an email to HuffPost last week. “In the second case, the hornbill, which has a broad contiguous range, our estimates of range size are approximately one-fifth of the range IUCN estimates.”Melnick said he was “extremely surprised by how much the IUCN ranges overestimated what we deem the true ranges to be.” “The drastic reduction in range size and the increased habitat fragmentation that our study indicates leads us to infer that there is a much greater threat to these endemic birds than was ever imagined,” he said.The discrepancies between IUCN’s findings and those of his team can be explained by the different data sets used by the two groups, explained Melnick.The IUCN, he said, typically uses maps provided to them by one of their many partner organizations (in the case of birds, the partner is BirdLife International) when determining a species’ geographic range. The problem with these maps, however, is that the information in them is often limited and misleading, said Melnick. “A majority of these range maps are essentially boundaries or polygons that are ‘drawn’ over a map based on the opinions of a handful of experts. For this reason, they often include areas of unsuitable habitat,” he said.For their assessment, Melnick and his team relied not on these range maps, but on citizen-driven science data from eBird, a website created by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. The researchers filtered the data for any sampling bias (such as counting the same bird twice) and subjected it to expert review, before employing a set of statistical models they’d developed to estimate the possible geographical range of each species. “Our methods limit the range of a species to those areas where they have been sighted and where a combination of ecological and geophysical characteristics predict they could inhabit. Therefore, unsuitable habitat is eliminated,” Melnick said. If the IUCN were to employ these same methods when conducting risk assessments of not just birds but all species, they’d probably come up with more accurate ― and more troubling ― conservation data, Melnick said. “It is likely that if the methods we employed were to be applied broadly, we would find out that many species are more threatened than we now think,” the researcher said. The IUCN Red List is the most comprehensive collection of the conservation status of the world’s species. Nicknamed the “barometer of life,” it encompasses the work of thousands of scientists and organizations to raise awareness about the world’s threatened species. Melnick stressed that he was neither undermining the good work that the IUCN does nor disagreeing with the criteria the Red List uses to assess whether a species is threatened. His team, he said, is merely seeking to challenge the IUCN on the “basic data” that is being used in its assessments ― a flaw that Melnick said could be fixed with relative ease. “Our methods, as described in our paper, are available to anyone who wishes to use them. The [citizen science] databases are also freely available. We would happily work with IUCN or other scientists to show them exactly how we apply the methods we used for data acquisition, data filtering, and species distribution modeling,” he said.Responding to the study, the IUCN said it agreed with some of the researchers’ conclusions ― though not all of them. “It’s great to have that feedback, and we will look into some of those issues,” Craig Hilton-Taylor, head of the Red List, told MongaBay.com, adding that the IUCN is already turning to citizen science in its work and agreeing that such data is proving increasingly valuable for conservation studies. Hilton-Taylor argued, however, that there was a “fundamental error” in the methodology used by Melnick and his team. The researchers, he claimed, misunderstood the difference between “Extent of Occurrence” and “Area of Occupancy,” two measures the IUCN uses in its extinction risk assessments.“Effectively what they’ve come up with is a maximum potential area of occupancy, and they’ve compared that to our Extent of Occurrence thresholds, which are an order of magnitude larger than the Area of Occupancy thresholds that we use,” he said. “They should have compared their thresholds against our Area of Occupancy thresholds, and then they would have found that most of the species would not qualify for more threatened status, and that in fact we have them correctly listed.”Hilton-Taylor did concede, however, that the IUCN needed to look “more carefully” at two of the 18 species assessed in the Columbia study.Melnick and his team were unfazed by the IUCN’s criticism. “We appreciate Hilton-Taylor’s response. It is through this back and forth, most of which we assume will occur out of public view, that we will arrive at a way forward,” the professor said. He stressed, however, that there had been no misunderstanding on their part. “By using the definitions in the IUCN guidelines, it is clear that our range maps are equivalent to IUCN’s Extent of Occurrence and not the Area of Occupancy,” he said, adding that his team “remains convinced” of the superior accuracy of their method. Melnick recommended that the IUCN consider adopting their system in its risk assessments. It would be well worth the time and effort, he said.“We assess vulnerability in order to prioritize the deployment of limited financial and human resources for conservation action. Getting a species’ vulnerability right is absolutely critical to setting those priorities,” Melnick said. “So even if it takes a bit more time, it is incumbent upon us to spend that time in order to get it right.” “Overestimating threat has few if any negative consequences,” he added, “[but] underestimating threat, as we believe the IUCN methods do, could be catastrophic.” "

19,MEDIA,Reporters Want To Keep Daily Briefing Even As Trump Admits Statements Not Always True,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-white-house-press-staff-not-true_us_5915b972e4b0fe039b340f26,Shifting account of the FBI director’s firing escalates a “credibility crisis” for the White House.,2017-05-12,Reporters raise their hands with questions as White House press secretary Sean Spicer speaks during the daily briefing in the Brady Briefing Room of the White House on May 9.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5915b9b81600001a22c5ae39.jpeg?cache=IywroK4FNS&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump admitted Friday what White House reporters already knew: His officials’ statements at press briefings may not be true. “As a very active President with lots of things happening, it is not possible for my surrogates to stand at podium with perfect accuracy!” Trump tweeted. “Maybe the best thing to do would be to cancel all future ‘press briefings’ and hand out written responses for the sake of accuracy???”Trump’s Twitter rant renewed questions about the utility of press briefings and whether reporters would be better served if they spent their afternoons doing something else. Ron Fournier, who spent more than two decades in Washington as a top political journalist and is now editor and publisher of Crain’s Detroit, told HuffPost he doesn’t believe briefings should be canceled.“It’s important that the president and his staff be accountable to the public, and coming out every day and defending themselves is an important part of the process,” he said. However, Fournier said news organizations would be wise to free up their best reporters’ time by keeping them out of the briefings and focused on digging into the administration. “If Sean Spicer walked into an empty room once in a while,” he said, “that wouldn’t be the worst thing either.”White House Correspondents’ Association President Jeff Mason said in an email that briefings and press conferences continue to “provide substantive and symbolic opportunities for journalists to pose questions to officials at the highest levels of the U.S. government.”“That exercise, conducted in full view of our republic’s citizens, is clearly in line with the spirit of the First Amendment,” he added. “Doing away with briefings would reduce accountability, transparency, and the opportunity for Americans to see that, in the U.S. system, no political figure is above being questioned. The White House Correspondents’ Association would object to any move that would threaten those constitutionally-protected principles.”Reporters don’t expect “perfect accuracy” from government officials and are accustomed to spin in the briefing room. That’s why they question and investigate officials’ claims. But reporters do expect White House officials to not intentionally mislead them and to arrive at the briefing room with basic facts about the timing and rationale of events. White House press secretary Sean Spicer and his deputy, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, claimed that Trump fired FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday in response to the recommendation of Deputy Attorney General Ron Rosenstein. But Trump contradicted his staff’s claims Thursday during an interview, claiming that he was going to fire Comey regardless. The president said Comey, who was investigating Trump associates’ ties to Russia, was a “showboat.”Trump’s shifting explanation of events “undercuts the message that does come from that podium,” NBC News White House correspondent Peter Alexander said on air Friday. “The podium used to really mean something. It used to be the message not just of the White House, but of America. Now, so much of what we’ve heard from there is at odds with the facts.” CNN political director David Chalian said Thursday that the White House is “in a crisis of credibility.”“It is unbelievable to watch Sarah Huckabee Sanders, for now the third day in a row, needing to adjust her story because the president did not send his team out with all the information, so therefore they were in the position of lying to the American people about why President Trump fired Director Comey,” Chalian said. Reporters’ frustrations over getting inaccurate information at the lectern isn’t new. Spicer came out of the gate lying in support of Trump’s baseless boasts about inauguration crowd size. In the briefing room, he’s defended Trump’s reckless conspiracy theory about rampant voter fraud and wasted weeks of reporters’ time spinning Trump’s baseless claim that former President Barack Obama wiretapped him. Spicer, who was on Navy Reserve duty on Wednesday and Thursday, is set to return to the briefing room on Friday. His absence fueled rumors that Trump is considering replacing the press secretary with Sanders.But Sanders’ claims have similarly come under scrutiny.For instance, she said Thursday during a briefing that “countless” FBI agents told her they were grateful Trump fired Comey ― something that contradicts the acting FBI chief and was challenged by veteran journalists, including Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times reporter Matt Apuzzo and CNN chief national security correspondent Jim Sciutto. “That is frankly not true,” Sciutto said Thursday night.Although Sanders’ temperament may differ from that of Spicer, who is more abrasive, her performance wasn’t more truthful, as The New York Times’ Maggie Haberman noted Wednesday. Her Times colleague, Glenn Thrush, tweeted Thursday that “it doesn’t matter who is at the podium ― if the information they provide isn’t true.”"
20,POLITICS,"Amid DOJ Turmoil, Jeff Sessions Honored By Police Union Boss Some Dub A 'Noisy Troll’",Ryan J. Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jeff-sessions-police-union-award-nypd_us_5915e292e4b00f308cf4f571,"Edward Mullins, a controversial police sergeant whom former NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton once called ""Crazy Eddie,"" declared Sessions an honorary member of his organization on Friday.",2017-05-12,Union president Edward Mullins gives Attorney General Jeff Sessions an award.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5916048d1e00003a00622c29.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― At the end of one of the most consequential weeks in the history of the U.S. Department of Justice ― a week that featured dramatic testimony from a former acting U.S. attorney general previously dismissed by the president, a week dominated by the commander-in-chief’s shock firing of the FBI director ― Attorney General Jeff Sessions walked into the room where the Justice Department makes news.But it wasn’t Sessions who spoke first in the conference room on the seventh floor of the Justice Department’s hulking headquarters building along Pennsylvania Avenue. Nor was it someone in a leadership position at Justice. Nor was it a U.S. attorney, another federal prosecutor, an FBI official or any other federal law enforcement official authorized to speak on behalf of the DOJ.The man standing behind the seal of the Justice Department had no affiliation with the nation’s federal law enforcement organization. He’s a controversial police union president, and he was there to give the 84th attorney general of the United States an award and declare Sessions an honorary member of his New York City police union.Police Sgt. Edward Mullins Jr. is the president of the Sergeants Benevolent Association of New York City. Standing before the cameras and reporters on Friday, Mullins said his police union was honoring Sessions because, “in a time when politicians and the top brass in police departments do not always have the courage to put the interests of non-citizens and officer safety ahead of political correctness and calculated re-election ploys,” the attorney general was committed to “having the backs” of cops in New York and beyond.Mullins, a member of the city’s police force since 1982, is a polarizing figure in New York. The Village Voice calls him “a noisy troll” and “a shrill contrarian with little regard for the public’s welfare.” Former New York City police Commissioner Bill Bratton called him “Crazy Eddie.” Another website once declared him “the worst person in New York.” He often uses inflammatory language about police-citizen conflicts, once accusing then-President Barack Obama of being anti-cop and supporting the idea of a police boycott of a Beyonce tour following her 2016 Super Bowl performance.After the murder of two New York City police officers in 2014, Mullins pinned their deaths on the mayor. “Mayor de Blasio, the blood of these two officers is clearly on your hands,” he said.In 2015, when the city of New York reached a settlement with the family of Eric Garner ― the Staten Island man who died after NYPD Officer Daniel Pantaleo put him in a prohibited chokehold during an arrest ― Mullins called the settlement “obscene.”In 2016, after current NYPD Commissioner James O’Neill said officers had made a mistake when they shot a 66-year-old mentally ill woman armed with a baseball bat, Mullins stormed out of the meeting.Speaking at Justice Department headquarters on Friday, Sessions said he respected Mullins. “I have long expressed my admiration for the successes you have achieved, Ed, you and your members,” the attorney general said.It was an unusual sight. Matthew Miller, who served as the Justice Department’s top spokesman under then-Attorney General Eric Holder, called it “very strange” for the nation’s top law enforcement official to receive an award from a police union at Justice Department headquarters.“Attorneys general often get awards from law enforcement when they speak at dinners and other events, but holding an event at the Justice Department just so you can get an award is a Trumpian-level of self-regard and self-promotion,” Miller told HuffPost.He added that he could think of no other non-DOJ officials, other than some state attorneys general, who had appeared behind the lectern at a press event in that room during his time at the department.Mullins said after the event that this was the first time his organization had honored a U.S. attorney general.“It’s Police Week and we’re in Washington, so it’s the perfect place to do it,” Mullins said. “If he was in New York, I could’ve done it there, but Police Week wasn’t being held in New York.”The mutual admiration between Sessions and the Sergeants Benevolent Association seems to have grown out of a recent dispute between the Justice Department and the NYPD. Last month, DOJ threatened to withhold federal law enforcement grants from so-called “sanctuary cities” it says are breaking the law by not proactively cooperating with federal law enforcement. In a press release, the Justice Department described New York City as “soft on crime,” despite record low crime rates in the city.Mayor Bill de Blasio called the claim an “outrageous” attack on rank-and-file police officers, while O’Neill said the “incredibly insulting” statement from DOJ made his “blood ... boil.”But Mullins, who wants the NYPD to more fully cooperate with federal immigration authorities, wasn’t insulted. He said the Justice Department was right to call out the city’s policies.In an interview after the DOJ event, Mullins praised Sessions’ decision this week to instruct federal prosecutors to always pursue the most serious charge available, including charges that trigger mandatory minimum sentences.“Law enforcement has been working at a disadvantage for a pretty long time,” Mullins said. “There’s a tremendous feeling of support that we’re experiencing right now from this office.”Sessions did not take any questions after the event, ignoring reporters’ shouted inquiries about his role in the firing of former FBI Director James Comey."

The Bristol Bay watershed supports all five species of Pacific salmon found in North America and accounts for almost half the world's supply of wild red salmon. (Bill Roth)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5915e1511600002000c5aefa.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The Trump administration announced Friday it had reached a legal settlement with a mining firm to pursue the construction of a proposed gold, copper and molybdenum mine in Alaska’s Bristol Bay watershed.President Barack Obama in 2014 blocked construction of the mine, which led to an ongoing legal dispute between the Environmental Protection Agency and developer Pebble Limited Partnership. The settlement clears the way for the company to apply for a federal permit to build the mine. EPA administrator Scott Pruitt said the agency is withdrawing its rejection in order to let the process move forward. Under Obama, Pebble had yet to submit an application, and an environmental assessment of the proposed project still needs to be completed. Opponents of the mine have argued it threatens the bay’s lucrative sockeye salmon fishery and outdoor recreation jobs.“We are committed to due process and the rule of law, and regulations that are ‘regular’,” Pruitt said. “We understand how much the community cares about this issue, with passionate advocates on all sides. The agreement will not guarantee or prejudge a particular outcome, but will provide Pebble a fair process for their permit application and help steer EPA away from costly and time-consuming litigation.”In return, Pebble has agreed to drop its lawsuits and fee requests against the EPA, the agency said. The company also agreed not to file new Freedom of Information Act requests with the EPA. Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd., which owns Pebble Limited, has 30 months to file a permit application.“From the outset of this unfortunate saga, we’ve asked for nothing more than fairness and due process under the law ― the right to propose a development plan for Pebble and have it assessed against the robust environmental regulations and rigorous permitting requirements enforced in Alaska and the United States,” Ron Thiessen, CEO of Northern Dynasty Minerals, said in a statement.Tom Collier, CEO of Pebble Partnership, said it would seek a smaller project than originally planned. “Not only will we be rolling out a project that is smaller, with demonstrable environmental protections, we will also be announcing a number of new initiatives to ensure our project is more responsive to the priorities and concerns of Alaskans,” Collier said.Jason Metrokin, CEO of Bristol Bay Native Corporation, said EPA’s decision is “far from the end of the story.”“BBNC is very disappointed the EPA and the Trump Administration have decided to withdraw the agency’s prior actions that sought to protect Bristol Bay from the proposed Pebble mine,” Metrokin said in a statement. “Pebble mine will risk thousands of long-held American jobs and Bristol Bay’s sustainable wild salmon fishery for the benefit of a foreign mining company.”“There will be a formal process before EPA can unwind its proposal and BBNC and the people of Bristol Bay will make our voices heard during this process,” Metrokin added.Hours before the settlement was reached, Alaska House Speaker Bryce Edgmon (D) expressed frustration that an agreement appeared to be in the works.“The people of the Bristol Bay region don’t need this kind of stress hanging over our heads once again and continuing on year after year,” Edgmon said, the Alaska Dispatch News reports.CORRECTION: This article previously misstated that the application deadline for filing for a permit is 30 days; it is 30 months."

Uber had sought a private resolution by arbitration.A federal judge ruled against Uber’s request Thursday night and referred the Google spinoff’s claims to the U.S. Attorney’s office for investigation into the possible theft of trade secrets. That leaves the door open for possible criminal charges, depending on the investigation’s outcome.“The Court takes no position on whether a prosecution is or is not warranted, a decision entirely up to the United States Attorney,” U.S. District Judge William Alsup cautioned in his order.Waymo accuses Uber of orchestrating and paying a former Waymo executive to steal valuable self-driving technology on its behalf, an accusation Uber staunchly denies.“This was a desperate bid by Uber to avoid the court’s jurisdiction,” a Waymo spokesperson told HuffPost in an emailed statement. “We welcome the court’s decision today, and we look forward to holding Uber responsible in court for its misconduct.”In a separate order late Thursday, Alsup also made a ruling on whether or not Uber could continue working on its self-driving car program as the case moves forward. Alsup’s decision on the so-called preliminary injunction was released under seal, however, as it contains confidential information, meaning the scope of its impact is unknown at this time.In a statement to HuffPost, Uber said it was disappointed in the ruling, but insisted it is innocent.“It is unfortunate that Waymo will be permitted to avoid abiding by the arbitration promise it requires its employees to make,” the company said in an emailed statement. “We remain confident in our case and welcome the chance to talk about our independently developed technology in any forum.”At the center of the case is Uber Vice President Anthony Levandowski, who was formerly a Waymo engineer. Waymo has strong evidence that Levandowski downloaded some 14,000 of its confidential files before abruptly leaving the company in January 2016. The files included valuable schematics for a Waymo circuit board that controls an important piece of self-driving technology known as lidar.Without lidar, both Uber’s and Waymo’s self-driving cars would be unable to “see” their surroundings and navigate appropriately.Almost immediately after Levandowski left Waymo, he started a rival company, Otto, which Uber acquired for $680 million just six months later. Waymo lawyer Charles Verhoeven argued in court this month that Otto was little more than a shell company for Levandowski to sell trade secrets to Uber, including lidar tech.Verhoeven said emails between Levandowski and Uber while the engineer was still at Waymo prove this point.“There was this clandestine plan all along that Uber and Levandowski had a deal,” Verhoeven said.Despite compelling evidence of Levandowski’s misdeeds, however, Judge Alsup initially thought Waymo lacked a “smoking gun” that proved Levandowski stole files at Uber’s direction.That matters because Waymo’s case is against Uber, not Levandowski.Waymo also struggled to prove Uber made use of its documents, despite having stumbled across a lidar circuit design Waymo says is suspiciously similar to its own.Uber said it searched its servers extensively and found no record of the files. It’s possible Levandowski brought the information to work on his personal laptop, but that’s hard to prove.“We are adamant that we did not use any of their secrets,” Gonzalez told the judge.Complicating matters, Levandowski asserted his Fifth Amendment rights and refused to testify ― a tactic Uber denounced, yet that also gave it a reason not to turn over additional, potentially incriminating documents.In his ruling Thursday night, Alsup let his disdain for the tactic be known, accusing Levandowski of obstructing the efforts of both companies.“Even though he is not a defendant here,” he wrote, “Levandowski’s assertion of his Fifth Amendment privilege has obstructed and continues to obstruct both discovery and defendants’ ability to construct a complete narrative as to the fate of Waymo’s purloined files.”"

24,MEDIA,Trump Suggests He Could Handle Press Briefings Instead Of Sean Spicer,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-press-briefings_us_5916149de4b00f308cf53be1,The president raised the idea of ending daily briefings by his press secretary and holding a press conference himself every two weeks.,2017-05-12,President Trump offers new idea after tweeting that he might cancel press briefings. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591615a91600002000c5af98.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump on Friday floated an alternative to his press secretary’s traditional daily press briefings: Himself. During an interview with Fox News host Jeanine Pirro, to air on Saturday, Trump suggested he moves too quickly for his communications staff. One solution, he said, is “we don’t have press conferences.” “You don’t mean that,” Pirro responded. “Well, just don’t have them,” Trump said. “Unless I have them every two weeks and I do them myself, we don’t have them. I think it’s a good idea.”Trump has reportedly been frustrated with how White House press secretary Sean Spicer has handled Trump’s firing of FBI Director James Comey amid the bureau’s investigation into whether Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia to influence the election. The president also is apparently angry with the news media for covering the fact that he contradicted claims by his own White House about the rationale and timing of the Comey firing.Journalists have described a “crisis of credibility” at the White House, with lies from the briefing room podium diminishing its stature. “The podium used to really mean something,” NBC News White House correspondent Peter Alexander said on air Friday. “It used to be the message not just of the White House, but of America. Now, so much of what we’ve heard from there is at odds with the facts.” Trump tweeted Friday that his staff can’t be expected to be “perfectly accurate” in the briefing room, and mused about canceling press briefings altogether. During Friday’s briefing, Spicer didn’t rule out that briefings could be canceled. Despite the misinformation that’s come from the podium, reporters see value in having the opportunity to question the White House on a daily basis. White House Correspondents’ Association President Jeff Mason said Friday that “doing away with briefings would reduce accountability, transparency, and the opportunity for Americans to see that, in the U.S. system, no political figure is above being questioned.”Mason said the association “would object to any move that would threaten those constitutionally protected principles.”"

I totally agree.In a picture perfect social media world, it’s good to know there are other mothers out there who have been the one dragging a screaming toddler through the shopping center getting looks of sympathy and disdain in equal measures.It’s good to know there are other mothers who have done five nappy changes before the morning is out and feel like they are slowly going crazy for it. And it’s really reassuring to know that others have contemplated if it’s appropriate to have a glass of wine in the afternoon to make the seemingly endless gap between nap time and bed time feel a little shorter (probably not appropriate but occasionally required ― just one).I really do love those posts, but I also know that for every really bad moment of motherhood there is at least one really great one, too. I know that those mothers who write these articles would lay down their lives for their children in an instant and although sometimes it feels like there is no light at the end of the tunnel (or even just the end of the day) they wouldn’t give up their children for anything.I also think about the IVF mothers. Those ladies doing IVF, waiting for their chance to become “real” mothers. Because these women are mothers, too.No, they haven’t had the exhaustion following a night up with a sick child, but they have had many sleepless nights too anxious to sleep worrying how many eggs will be collected tomorrow or if the eggs will fertilize or if there will be an embryo to transfer or any of the million other things that can go wrong in the IVF process.They haven’t had the guilt of snapping at their toddler because she is just hard work that day, but they have had the guilt of wondering if it was because they left it too late or partied too hard or wasn’t healthy enough that caused them to now have difficulty having children.They haven’t endlessly researched what the best school or daycare center nearby is, but they have spent numerous hours trying to find alternative ways to increase their chances of getting that take home baby.They haven’t had the feeling that their body no longer belongs to them but rather to the breastfeeding baby that constantly demands it around the clock, but they have had the feeling that their body is unrecognizable from what it was because of the medications bloating it or the surgical interventions scaring it.And they do all this knowing that they may never be a “real” mum. That the baby they wish for may never actually make it into the world.These mothers, the IVF mothers, focus every day on making their future child. From the daily injections we hear so often about to the white lies being told at work so you can go to another fertility clinic appointment undetected.The baby showers they go to so they can prove to the world that infertility isn’t owning them but secretly they are not sure how they are going to get through it. The hurt that is felt when being asked, “When are you going to have children?” and the greater hurt of when it is obvious they are having difficulty having children and this question stops.These mothers have had more embryos in their womb then many “real” mothers ever will. They have lived through far more two-week-waits then anyone should have to.They also have the strength of being a “real” mother. Just like a real mother knows that the hard times won’t last forever so does an IVF mother. Though it’s easy to forget, this time won’t last forever.Whether their miracle baby gets born or they form their family by some other way, or even if they eventually make their peace with the fact that life may be far different to what they always intended, infertility won’t be all consuming forever.These IVF mothers don’t need our sympathy but they need to be acknowledged for the mothers that they are, even if it is a mother of a different sort.So next time you read a story about how hard motherhood is, spare a thought for the IVF mothers. I’ve lived both sides as an IVF mother and a “real” mother.Both have its challenges and it’s not a competition that either would want to win. But in my opinion, the only thing harder than being a real mother, is not being one."

During the next three years, they worked hard to realize that dream, earning and saving enough money to afford the expensive adoption fees. How did they do this? They flipped houses! Meet the gay dads who call themselves the Property Gays.A Novel Way to SaveJosh was a credit strategist and Joey was working at Carvana when they met on a gay dating app in July 2013. They started messaging each other; then they began speaking on the phone. On their first date, two days later, it was a kiss that sealed the deal – one that Joey describes as ""something straight from a movie."" Everything happened in quick succession after that kiss: They professed their love for one another, exchanged keys to their apartments and within months they even made wedding plans. August 30, 2017 will be their third wedding anniversary!For Josh, 32, and Joey, 31, becoming dads was the next obvious step, and they already knew that they wanted to pursue adoption. Now they needed to make sure they had saved enough money to cover the adoption fees. They began the adoption process in May 2015, just after they sold their first home to help raise capital.Despite neither of the dads-to-be having much experience of renovating prior to 2015, both had a passion for interior design. Josh is also a licensed real estate agent (since 2010), so he’d had quite a bit of experience in the field from working with clients. Over the next two years, it became a secondary business for them as they honed their skills; Josh initially was more the designer and finder of the homes, but now Joey began to take on that role as well.In the past 18 months, they have purchased, renovated and sold three homes!People often say that flipping houses is very a stressful pastime. So, how did a newlywed couple handle the stress of buying, renovating and selling, AND the adoption process?""Alcohol. Kidding, not really,"" shared Joey. ""We definitely have had our moments of pure frustration and anger but we know there is light at the end of the tunnel. It allowed us to make a significant amount of money in a short period of time to afford the big chunk of money we have to put down towards adoption costs.""They knew that their hard work would pay off and get them closer to their dream of having a family.On the Road to AdoptionSoon they signed with LifeLong Adoptions in California, an agency specializing in LGBT adoptions. The agency connected them with a birth mother not long afterwards, but despite their best efforts the adoption didn’t happen. Ultimately, the mother decided to keep her child. It was a difficult time for Joey and Josh, because despite the agency’s warnings, they had already grown very attached.But things seemed to work themselves out, eventually. In February 2016, they were matched again, to a birth mom in Alabama. The next three months were frantic as the dads-to-be were moving into their next home, and trying to build a relationship with the birth mom, Ashley*, who was on methadone and required daily trips to the clinic. In order to prevent unnecessary stress to the birth mother and the baby, the aspiring dads paid for all those trips. For a while, the birth mom’s boyfriend claimed to be the baby daddy and tried to extort Josh and Joey for more money. That paternity claim, thankfully, was false, and so the problem vanished, although it nearly came to a breaking point when Joey and Josh wondered whether to continue this journey with this birth mom.It was Ashley who knew that her child was going to have a better life with Joey and Josh, and for that reason she never wavered from her decision for them to adopt.Daughter Myles was born five and half weeks early, on May 25, 2016, after a death scare. Ashley’s placenta erupted and Myles was born 32 minutes later by an emergency c-section – Ashley and her unborn baby almost died! Fortunately, Ashley and Myles recovered quickly. And there was more good news: Myles showed no typical methadone withdrawal or side effects. When Myles was born, Joey decided to become a full-time dad. The adoption was finalized September 2016.Despite being close with Ashley during the last four months of the pregnancy, Joey and Josh have lost contact her recently. They know she is going through a difficult time and are ready to reestablish a relationship with her when she’s ready. Ashley has entered rehab and has been struggling since October. Josh and Joey wish her the best. They remain close with Ashley's sister who is currently caring for two of Myles' brothers and they are thriving under her care.Ready for More Kids?Today the gay dads are in their fourth house, and might be in their fifth house come spring. They have also taken steps to adopt again. This time they’re using Adoption Information Services, an agency closer to their home in Atlanta, Georgia. Although they recommend LifeLong Adoptions, both Josh and Joey wanted to try an agency close enough to make face-to-face conversations possible. Moreover, this agency acts more as a third party to help alleviate some of the more difficult steps of the adoption, such as the revocation period. For Myles' adoption, there were five very stressful days when Ashley could have changed her mind about the adoption. Now, their new agency works only in states where the revocation period is 48 hours.""We do want more children,"" said Joey. ""I think four would be an ideal number, but we are taking a break after two. In the future we would like to try surrogacy, but if that is not an option, we will definitely adopt again.""From their very successful side project of flipping homes, they have been able to fund one adoption and have started their second. The dads admit the drawbacks of flipping homes is definitely the stress of moving and packing, but both agree that nothing beat renovating a home and then living in it. Sure, there have been times that they just had to walk away from one another. Moving everything you own to a new house is hard. They also have three dogs, five fish and a baby. Sometimes moving becomes even more challenging when the new house doesn’t have a functioning kitchen yet! However, the happy ending to their emotional roller coaster of an adoption journey makes every low bearable and every high more incredible.Josh and Joey are so proud and excited to be Myles’ Dada and Daddy first, and the Property Gays second.*Ashley is not the birth mother’s real name.UPDATE: Josh and Joey have recently added to their family again - welcome baby Micah! Read their exciting news."

In honor of the holiday my staff asked moms across the country what they really wanted to celebrate their day.Some folks want jewelry and others a lovely bouquet of flowers, but like most Americans, the moms we talked to cared deeply about their family and the clean air, water and safe planet that we need to ensure that kids today and long into the future are healthy.On that topic, I’m cross-posting a timely column by my colleague Madeline Page, Environment America’s global warming outreach director.My mom wants climate action, not breakfast in bedSunday is Mother’s Day. A day dedicated to celebrating the mothers in our lives—women who have sacrificed, inspired, protected and forced us to eat our vegetables.My own mom is a retired teacher of the blind and visually impaired (HAPPY MOTHER’S DAY, MOM!). She always went beyond her role as educator--making sure her students were fed, safe and received the tools they needed to excel, despite their special needs.I saw my mother fight tirelessly for her students for decades. But the one fight that has always left her feeling defenseless: being a parent to a child with asthma. I’ll never forget hearing my mom’s stories about caring for my sister during life threatening flare ups. On one particularly bad night, my mom ran carrying my blanket-wrapped sister into the emergency room. At first glance the doctor could tell my sister was near cardiac arrest—it took four shots of adrenaline before she could breathe again. In my mom’s words, “it was terrifying.” But trips to emergency room became commonplace as my sister’s asthma flare ups were exacerbated by poor air quality. That was 1978. Although our air is cleaner than it was 40 years ago, air pollution is still a major threat to our health. And unlike some environmental health hazards, air pollution is unavoidable: even when we know it’s hurting us, we have no choice but to breathe it. Air pollution increases our risk of serious health problems, including premature death, heart attacks, asthma, and respiratory illness.Everyone deserves clean air. That is why it is so outrageous that President Trump is taking an ax to the Environmental Protection Agency and gutting important policies that clean up our air.According to a new report from Environment America Research & Policy Center, people living in 72 different metropolitan areas across America experienced at least 100 days with unhealthy levels of air pollution. People in those cities face an increased risk of premature death, asthma attacks, and other adverse health impacts.And those statistics do not capture the full extent of the problem. People who live near local pollution “hotspots” face higher levels of pollution and even greater health risks. For example, people who live near busy roads are more likely to develop lung cancer, and at greater risk of death from stroke, lung disease and heart disease.It’s not just soot and smog we need to worry about. Global warming pollution is a major part of the problem too. Warming is extending the smog season throughout the year and driving dangerous smog levels up on hot days. Warming is also intensifying drought and making wildfires more frequent and intense – causing additional pollution that can travel hundreds of miles.The United States can and must do better! It’s the year 2017. Instead of continuing to pollute the air, we can build a cleaner, greener, healthier country, where the air is safe for everyone and where the climate is stable and able to support healthy communities.Even one day with unhealthy air is too many. And for people with asthma like my mom and sister, it’s a matter of life or death.And yet we still see attacks on clean air in DC. We have an entrenched fossil fuel lobby willing to spend millions to protect its profits, and now they have an ally at the helm of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In just the first 100 days, the President has proposed slashing the budget of the Environmental Protection Agency by 31 percent and instructed the agency to rewrite the largest steps taken by the United States to cut dangerous global warming pollution: the Clean Power Plan and federal clean cars standards.Make no mistake, these proposals would hurt our health. Trashing the Clean Power Plan alone will lead to 3,600 additional premature deaths, 90,000 more asthma attacks in children, and 300,000 more missed work and school days across the country by 2030.Parents have a lot on their plate, but worrying about clean air for their children shouldn’t be.My sister and I live in the northeast, where we currently have a huge opportunity to cut power plant pollution. I’m urging our governors to double the strength of the most successful regional clean air and climate protection program, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, and not leave any pollution cuts on the table. And in the face of these dangerous actions from the Trump Administration, our senators must stand up for our health, too.The more we cut pollution, the sooner dirty air days can become a thing of the past. Passing on a healthy planet to the next generation should be the top priority.P.S.

George W. Bush dealt it a major blow with his decision to invade Iraq without United Nations Security Council approval. Barack Obama did his best to repair the torn international legal fabric but often declined to provide the kind of muscular, skin-in-the-game leadership on international crises that U.S. allies ― and adversaries ― had come to expect, thus feeding a narrative of U.S. decline and withdrawal.On the economic side, the failure of multilateral trade negotiations since the Uruguay Round (1986-1994) and the proliferation of plurilateral and bilateral agreements have had international trade lawyers worried for almost two decades. The rise of new institutions such as the Asian Infrastructure Development Bank and the New Development Bank (formerly known as the BRICS Bank), as well as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, have essentially put the West on notice that rising and returning powers will not wait for their place at the global table.Donald Trump has declared that U.S. global leadership is a costly and unnecessary expense, except where U.S. interests are directly involved. His missile strike in response to the Syrian chemical attack was an act to uphold the Chemical Weapons Convention, a global norm, but it was not part of a defined strategy. Similarly, his administration’s effort to intimidate North Korea into genuine concessions on its nuclear program and to cajole and bully China into applying more pressure on the North Korean government is upholding the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, but only in the context of a direct threat to U.S. security. Would Trump do the same if North Korea were not building intercontinental missiles capable of hitting the U.S.?Ask yourself what would happen if Iraq invaded Kuwait tomorrow, as it did in 1991, or if any non-nuclear country invaded another with the express goal of taking over its government. Can we really imagine Trump leading a global coalition to push the aggressors back and punish them? As Ian Bremmer and Nouriel Roubini warned in 2011, a “G-Zero world,” with no one state at the global helm, is a scary place.So what is to be done? Pascal Lamy, the former head of the World Trade Organization, recently reflected on this problem at a meeting held by the Berggruen Institute. He asked whether global governance must shift from the concept of multilateral to “poly-lateral” arrangements that involve not only official governing institutions but also global corporations and civil society groups. More specifically, Lamy invoked a suggestion by Ernesto Zedillo, the former President of Mexico, regarding the formation of new “coalitions of the willing” of subnational actors — states, provinces and cities around the world — on climate change.The world is actually already there. As I wrote in my new book, The Chessboard and the Web: Strategies of Connection in a Networked World, Bloomberg Philanthropies has played a leading role in creating and funding international climate change networks and in mobilizing mayors and other web actors in thousands of cities to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate climate change. Those mayors and many of the corporations who work in their cities are all part of the Paris Agreement on climate change, recognized as “non-party stakeholders.”Viewed from another perspective, California is the sixth-largest economy in the world and, with almost 40 million people, is larger than most members of the European Union. Around the world, the mayors of many cities govern more citizens than many heads of state. And the largest global corporations have a market capitalization that is many times the GDP of smaller nations.These actors are already enmeshed in webs of global relationships. It is time to connect them to one another and to governments in networks that are strategically designed to accomplish specific purposes: building resilience, stabilizing fragile societies, responding to crises, fostering innovation, cumulating knowledge and effort and bringing solutions to scale.The designers and leaders of these networks may be working out of foreign ministries, but they are equally likely to be found in corporate suites, foundation headquarters, churches, charities, universities and start-ups. They will need a new set of mapping and management tools: networks cannot be commanded the way hierarchies can. Indeed, the most important network leadership skills are curation, connection, cross-fertilization, cultivation and catalysis.The good news, however, is that the opportunities for trying, failing, learning and succeeding with strategies of connection is vast. “Webcraft” is far more accessible and adaptable than statecraft. Chessboard crises and negotiations will remain, from arms races to trade wars. They require time-tested strategies of conflict and cooperation. But for so many problems — climate change, terrorism, arms and drug trafficking, fragile states, migrants and refugees, youth employment and many more — we need new strategies of connection."

So they’ve hired Nick Melvoin to get rid of him. No, he’s not a hired assassin like the kind on “The Sopranos.” He’s a lawyer who the billionaires picked to defeat Zimmer.The so-called “Independent” campaign for Melvoin -- funded by big oil, big tobacco, Walmart, Enron, and other out-of-town corporations and billionaires — has included astonishingly ugly, deceptive, and false attack ads against Zimmer.This morning (Friday) the Los Angeles Times reported that “Outside spending for Melvoin (and against Zimmer) has surpassed $4.65 million.” Why? Because he doesn’t agree with the corporatization of our public schools. Some of their donations have gone directly to Melvoin’s campaign, but much of it has been funneled through a corporate front group called the California Charter School Association. To try to hoodwink voters, the billionaires invented another front group with the same initials as the well-respected Parent Teacher Association, but they are very different organizations. They called it the “Parent Teacher Alliance.” Pretty clever, huh? But this is not the real PTA, which does not get involved with elections. In fact, the real PTA has demanded that this special interest PAC change their name and called the billionaires’ campaign Zimmer “misleading,” “deceptive practices,” and “false advertising.”These out-of-town billionaire-funded groups can pay for everything from phone-banks, to mailers, to television ads. Los Angeles Times columnist Steve Lopez described the billionaires’ campaign to defeat Zimmer, which includes sending mails filled with outrageous lies about Zimmer, as “gutter politics.”As a result, the race for the District 4 seat — which stretches from the Westside to the West San Fernando Valley — is ground zero in the battle over the corporate take-over of public education. The outcome of next Tuesday’s (May 16) election has national implications in terms of the billionaires’ battle to reconstruct public education in the corporate mold.The contest between Melvoin and Zimmer is simple. Who should run our schools? Who knows what’s best for students? Out-of-town billionaires or parents, teachers, and community residents?Before examining just who these corporate carpetbaggers are, let’s look at who Steve Zimmer is, what he’s accomplished, and what he stands for.Zimmer grew up in a working class community and attended public schools. His father was a printer and his mother was a school teacher. After college, he became a teacher, beginning with Teach for America in 1992. He spent 17 years as a teacher and counselor at Marshall High School. When he taught English as a second language, he used an experiential approach that related to his students’ daily lives. He created Marshall’s Public Service Program to make public service intrinsic to the student experience. He founded Marshall’s Multilingual Teacher Career Academy, which was an early model for LAUSD’s Career Ladder Teacher Academy. To help address the concerns of at-risk youth, he founded the Comprehensive Student Support Center to provide health care services for students and their families. He helped create the Elysian Valley Community Services Center, a community owned-and-operated agency that provides after-school, recreational and enrichment programs, a library, and free Internet access.He was elected to the school board in 2009 and re-elected in 2013 despite the onslaught of billionaire bucks against him. What are some of Zimmer’s most important accomplishments on the school board?• Improving student success. Zimmer’s leadership helped increase local graduation rates into their highest level ever. LAUSD schools achieved across-the-board improvements in state testing and all measurable forms of student achievement.• Balanced budgets. As school board president, Zimmer helped bring LAUSD’s budget into balance while simultaneously increasing funding to the classrooms. Zimmer helped lead the fight to get Congress to pass the Education Jobs Bill passed, which provided LAUSD with $300 million. He has fought for increased federal Special Education funding. He championed Proposition 30 and its extension, Proposition 55, which added more school funding for LAUSD. His stewardship has paid off. LAUSD has been awarded the highest credit rating of AAA.• More schools, more opportunities. As a result of Zimmer’s leadership and in response to parent interest, LAUSD has added many more magnet schools, STEM programs and dual immersion language programs.• Restoring arts education. Zimmer worked to restore arts programs not just in some schools but in all schools. He believes access to arts education needs to be a right for all students in every community. It is an essential component to a well-rounded education. Since he’s been in office, arts funding has increased by $18 million dollars and the Arts Equity Index that he championed, now ensures resources where they are needed the most.• Protecting vulnerable students. As a school board member, Zimmer has been the leading advocate for vulnerable students. He authored the school board resolution in support of the Dream Act, federal legislation that would provide a path to citizenship for undocumented students who do well in school and attend college. He authored the resolution ensuring schools are safe zones where students and families faced immigration enforcement actions can find safety and seek assistance and information. He helped create Student Recovery Day, a twice-yearly event that takes scores of district staff into students’ homes to support students who have dropped out. Hundreds of students have returned to class after being sought out and connected with the support services they need. He has ensured that the school district supports the needs of students living in poverty, students facing trauma, special education students, undocumented students, LGBT students, English Learners, standard English learners and foster children.• Healthy food. Zimmer’s commitment to making sure students eat healthy meals is unparalleled. His Good Food Purchasing resolution has been a model around the country for making sure student lunches have met the highest nutritional, environmental and animal welfare standards.As a member of the Board, and his last two years as President, Zimmer led the school district through difficult times, weathering a recession, dealing with tragedies, and transitions in leadership. He used his skills to resolve challenges by working collaboratively.Zimmer has received numerous awards for his work with children and families, including the LA’s Commission of Children, Youth and their Families “Angel Over Los Angeles” award, El Centro Del Pueblo’s “Carino” award and the LACER Foundation’s “Jackie Goldberg Public Service Award.”Nick Melvoin is the candidate completely sponsored by the 1 percent. His extreme lack of experience clearly doesn’t bother them. Melvoin is so devoted to the corporate agenda for our schools that he claims a “hostile takeover” is needed. Who are some of the billionaires and corporate lobby groups that want to defeat Steve Zimmer and elect Nick Melvoin?• Members of the Walton family (Alice Walton, Jim Walton, and Carrie Walton Penner) ― heirs to the Wal-Mart fortune from Arkansas ― have contributed $2.2 million to the PAC attacking Zimmer in the last two years. Alice Walton (net worth: $36.9 billion) lives in Texas and is one of the biggest funders behind Melvoin’s campaign. She and other members of her family also donated to the Super PAC that worked to elect Donald Trump, donated to Mike Pence, Jeff Sessions, and to the Alliance for School Choice, an organization that Trump’s Education Secretary Betsy DeVos helped to lead.• Oil and Enron executives from Texas and Oklahoma have contributed more than $1 million to the same committee.• JOBSPAC — a PAC “largely funded by oil and tobacco companies,” according to the Los Angeles Times – contributed $35,000 to the same committee funding the attacks on Zimmer.• Doris Fisher, co-founder of The Gap who has a net worth of $2.7 billion, has given $4.1 million to the California Charter School Association’s political action committee in 2015 and 2016. She lives in San Francisco.• John Arnold made a fortune at Enron before the company collapsed, leaving its employees and stockholders in the lurch. Then he made another fortune as a hedge fund manager. His net worth is $2.9 billion. He and his wife Laura donated $1 million last year to CCSA’s political committee and $4400 directly to Melvoin. They live in Houston, Texas.• Jeff Yass, who lives in the Philadelphia suburbs, has given the maximum allowed contribution to Melvoin. He runs the Susquahanna group, a hedge fund. He has close ties to Betsy DeVos’ efforts to privatize public school. Yass donated $2.3 million to a Super PAC supporting Rand Paul’s presidential candidacy.• Frank Baxter and his wife Kathrine donated $100,000 to CCSA’s political committee in the past two years and $3,300 directly to Melvoin. Frank Baxter is former CEO of the global investment bank Jefferies and Company that specialized in “junk” bonds. He is a major Republican fundraiser and was appointed ambassador to Uruguay by George W. Bush. He is one of at least five donors to Melvoin’s campaign who sit on the board of charter schools. He is also a big financial backer of Republicans like House Speaker Paul Ryan, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Cong. Devin Nunes of California, and Cong. Steve King of Iowa (a Tea Party favorite).What do these corporate moguls and billionaires want and what has Zimmer done to make them so upset?They want to turn public schools into educational Wal-marts run on the same corporate model. They want to expand charter schools that compete with each other and with public schools in an educational “market place.” (LA already has more charter schools than any other district in the country). They want to evaluate teachers and students like they evaluate new products — in this case, using the bottom-line of standardized test scores. Most teachers will tell you that over-emphasis on standardized testing turns the classroom into an assembly line, where teachers are pressured to “teach to the test,” and students are taught, robot-like, to define success as answering multiple-choice tests.Not surprisingly, the billionaires want school employees — teachers — to do what they’re told, without having much of a voice in how their workplace functions or what is taught in the classroom. Rather than treat teachers like professionals, they view them as the out-sourced hired help.The corporate big-wigs are part of an effort that they and the media misleadingly call “school reform.” What they’re really after is not “reform” (improving our schools for the sake of students) but “privatization” (business control of public education). They think public schools should be run like corporations, with teachers as compliant workers, students as products, and the school budget as a source of profitable contracts and subsidies for textbook companies, consultants, and others engaged in the big business of education.Like most reasonable educators and education analysts, Zimmer has questioned the efficacy of charter schools as a panacea. When the billionaires unveiled their secret plan to put half of LAUSD students into charter schools within eight years, Zimmer led the opposition. Zimmer isn’t against all charter schools but he doesn’t want the board to rubber-stamp every charter proposal. He wants LAUSD to carefully review each charter proposal to see if its backers have a track record of success and inclusion. And he wants LAUSD to hold charters accountable. This kind of reasonable approach doesn’t sit well with the billionaires behind their front group, the California Charter School Association.Zimmer has also questioned the over-reliance on high-stakes standardized testing as the primary tool for assessing student and teacher performance. Testing has its place but it can also become an excuse to avoid more useful and holistic ways to evaluate students and teachers — and to avoid the “teach to the test” obsession that hampers learning and creative teaching. Zimmer has called for — and helped negotiate the deal for — some portion of teacher evaluations to include test scores. But that’s not what the billionaires want.As a former LAUSD teacher with 17 years in the classroom, Zimmer respects teachers as professionals. He understands the jobs and frustrations of teaching. He wants LAUSD to create schools that are truly partnerships between teachers, parents, students and the district. He is often allied with United Teachers Los Angeles, but he is nobody’s lapdog. He has always been an independent voice and has disagreed with UTLA on some significant matters.In fact, four years ago, Times’ columnist Lopez wrote that Zimmer “... has tried to bridge differences among the warring parties, winning supporters and making enemies on both sides in the process.”But the billionaires don’t want a bridge-builder. They want a compliant rubber stamp, and that’s what they’ve found in Nick Melvoin, the advocate for a “hostile takeover.”Zimmer is endorsed by many LAUSD parents and community activists as well as Mayor Eric Garcetti, Senator Bernie Sanders, Congressmembers Karen Bass, Judy Chu and Maxine Waters, City Attorney Mike Feuer and the Councilmembers serving the neighborhoods in his 4th School Board District. At the state level, State Superintendent Tom Torlakson, Secretary of State Alex Padilla, State Controller Betty Yee, Senate President Pro Tem Kevin De Leon, and Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon have all endorsed Zimmer. At the County level, he’s backed by Supervisors Hilda Solis and Sheila Kuehl along with former Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky.In his endorsement of Zimmer, Mayor Garcetti said: “The campaign against Steve has turned vicious, and I feel compelled to reach out on behalf of a champion for all our kids. I’ve worked closely with Steve Zimmer for more than 15 years. I’ve watched him make change in the lives of kids and in the fabric of our communities. Under Steve’s leadership, Los Angeles Unified schools have shown impressive progress. Steve’s collaborative, ‘all kids, all families’ approach is what we need on the School Board.”The Los Angeles Unified School District is the second largest school system in the country with over 700,000 students. So gaining control of its board — and its budget — is a good “investment” for the billionaires who want to reshape education in this country.Melvoin’s campaign and backers have outspent Zimmer by a huge margin. Their battle has turned into a remarkable David vs. Goliath contest. But let’s recall who won that Biblical battle. Goliath had the big weapons but the feisty David had the slingshot. That’s how Zimmer beat another hand-picked billionaire-backed candidate four years ago, with a grassroots campaign that relied on parents, teachers, and neighborhood residents, and he’s hoping to do it again next Tuesday.Peter Dreier is professor of politics and chair of the Urban & Environmental Policy Department at Occidental College."

Tures, ContributorProfessor of Political Science, LaGrange College",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-the-spurs-kept-james-harden-and-kawhi-leonard_us_5915f94fe4b00ccaae9ea257,"After defeating Houston, the Spurs limp into the Wester Conference Finals.",2017-05-12,<p>Photo is of LeBron James and his Cavaliers closing out another playoff series. He’s now the front-runner for the MVP Award after Harden and Leonard were eliminated from contention last night.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5915fa8e1e00003b00622c0b.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last night, the San Antonio Spurs had a game for the ages in the NBA, shutting down Houston’s MVP candidate James Harden. But in doing so, they may have also cost their best player, the injured Kawhi Leonard, his chance at winning his first MVP Award.Lacking two of their biggest stars, a year after the franchise’s best player retired, the Spurs closed out the Houston Rockets in six games on the road with a 39 point win in the Western Semifinal Series. In doing so, they held James Harden of the Houston Rockets to perhaps his worst game as a professional basketball player.And the statistics don’t tell the whole tale. The highly-talented Harden of Houston looked confused and lost, making all kinds of turnovers and mental mistakes. In fact, the entire Rockets team looked as though they were stuck in a bad dream.That’s because Houston was supposed to be the easy winners. They humiliated the Spurs early in the series to take away home court advantage. San Antonio had to play their best game just to win game 2, and then fight hard to take back the series initiative, winning one of two in Houston. In Game 5, ageless Argentinian Guard Manu Ginobili blocked a Harden three-point attempt to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, helping his team manage a 110-107 win in overtime.But it was a costly night for San Antonio in Game 5. Already seeing future Hall-of-Fame point guard Tony Parker lost for the year with an injury, the Spurs lost Kawhi Leonard to an injury as well. That’s why the team had to limp their way to a narrow win to take a three-to-two game lead in the best of seven series.Already, the pundits were writing off the Spurs. They predicted Ginobili’s block to be more of a “last gasp” for the proud franchise’s incredible run since Coach Greg Popovich took over. Other sportscasters noted that without Leonard for Game 6, and possibly Game 7, Houston was the favorite to win the series, and would provide the more intriguing matchup with the Golden State Warriors.Houston looked like they read too many of their headlines proclaiming themselves the favorite. And without Parker and Leonard, why not? What would they have to prepare for?But that’s because they underestimated Greg Popovich, the talented but inconsistent LaMarcus Aldrdige, Pau Gasol, Jonathon Simmons, the ageless Manu Ginobili, Patty Mills and rookie guard Dejounte Murray. All are underrated, but they turned in an incredible performance. The team led by more than 20 points going into halftime, and kept their foot on the gas pedal the whole game in the 114-75 blowout. The Rockets looked more like SCUD Missile duds. Coach Mike D’Antoni looked as confused as his players by the Spurs outburst, led by Aldridge, who turned in a career game.Yet sadly, the Spurs may have lost their team leader, Kawhi Leonard, the MVP trophy. A top-notch defender, good scorer, and winner of the 2014 NBA Finals MVP, Leonard was considered a top 4 candidate (even the best candidate by many), along with Harden, LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers, and Stephen Curry of the Warriors. But just as the Spurs showed that Harden wasn’t one of league’s best, they also proved they could win without Leonard. Now it’s a battle between James and Curry.However, the Spurs have put Leonard in a chance to win another NBA Finals MVP. If he can return from the injury, and his teammates play this well, it will be the Spurs hoisting the finals trophy for 2017, instead of the Warriors, Cavs or Boston Celtics.John A.

No lines or waiting. Just a lush, indoor garden. But these plants aren’t something you can find in your neighbor’s yard – their genes have been redesigned to act as sensors, and the plants will change color if someone walks past with explosives.The Genome Project Write (GP-write) got off to a rocky start last year when it held a “secret” meeting that prohibited journalists. News of the event leaked, and the press quickly turned to fears of designer babies and Frankenstein-like creations. This year, organizers of the meeting learned from the 2016 debacle. Not only did they invite journalists, but they also highlighted work by researchers like June Medford, whose plants research could lead to advancements like the security garden described above.Jef Boeke, one of the lead authors of the GP-write Grand Challenge, emphasized that this project was not just about writing the human genome. “The notion that we could write a human genome is simultaneously thrilling to some and not so thrilling to others,” Boeke told the group. “We recognize that this will take a lot of discussion.”Boeke explained that the GP-write project will focus on the genomes of cells, and the researchers involved are not trying to produce an organism. He added that this work could be used to solve problems associated with climate change and the environment, invasive species, pathogens, and food insecurity.I spoke with genetics researcher, John Min, to learn more about what GP-write is and what it could accomplish. Min is not directly involved with GP-write, but he works with George Church, another of the lead authors of the project.Min explained, “We aren’t currently capable of making DNA as long as human chromosomes ― we can’t make that from scratch in the laboratory. In this case, they’ll use CRISPR to make very specific cuts in the genome of an existing cell, and either use synthesized DNA to replace whole chunks or add new functionality in.”He added, “An area of potentially exciting research with this new project is to create a human cell immune to all known viruses. If we can create this in the lab, then we can start to consider how to apply it to people around the world. Or we can use it to build an antibody library against all known viruses. Right now, tackling such a project is completely unaffordable ― the costs are just too astronomic.”But costs aren’t the only reason GP-write is hugely ambitious. It’s also incredibly challenging science. To achieve the objectives mentioned above, scientists will synthesize, from basic chemicals, the building blocks of life. Synthesizing a genome involves slowly editing out tiny segments of genes and replacing them with the new chemical version. Then researchers study each edit to determine what, if anything, changed for the organism involved. Then they repeat this for every single known gene. It is a tedious, time-consuming process, rife with errors and failures that send scientists back to the drawing board over and over, until they finally get just one gene right. On top of that, Min explained, it’s not clear how to tell when a project transitions from editing a cell, to synthesizing it. “How many edits can you make to an organism’s genome before you can say you’ve synthesized it?” he asked.Clyde Hutchison, working with Craig Venter, recently came closest to answering that question. He and Venter’s team published the first paper depicting attempts to synthesize a simple bacterial genome. The project involved understanding which genes were essential, which genes were inessential, and discovering that some genes are “quasi-essential.” In the process, they uncovered “149 genes with unknown biological functions, suggesting the presence of undiscovered functions that are essential for life.”This discovery tells us two things. First, it shows just how enormous the GP-write project is. To find 149 unknown genes in simple bacteria offers just a taste of how complicated the genomes of more advanced organisms will be. Kris Saha, Assistant Professor of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, explained this to the Genetic Experts News Service:“The evolutionary leap between a bacterial cell, which does not have a nucleus, and a human cell is enormous. The human genome is organized differently and is much more complex. […] We don’t entirely understand how the genome is organized inside of a typical human cell. So given the heroic effort that was needed to make a synthetic bacterial cell, a similar if not more intense effort will be required ― even to make a simple mammalian or eukaryotic cell, let alone a human cell.”Second, this discovery gives us a clue as to how much more GP-write could tell us about how biology and the human body work. If we can uncover unknown functions within DNA, how many diseases could we eliminate? Could we cure aging? Could we increase our energy levels? Could we boost our immunities? Are there risks we need to prepare for?The best assumption for that last question is: yes.“Safety is one of our top priorities,” said Church at the event’s press conference, which included other leaders of the project. They said they expect safeguards to be engineered into research “from the get-go,” and part of the review process would include assessments of whether research within the project could be developed to have both positive or negative outcomes, known as Dual Use Research of Concern (DURC).The meeting included roughly 250 people from 10 countries with backgrounds in science, ethics, law, government, and more. In general, the energy at the conference was one of excitement about the possibilities that GP-write could unleash.“This project not only changes the way the world works, but it changes the way we work in the world,” said GP-write lead author Nancy J. Kelley."

Regardless of the reasoning, pundits and politicos will spend the foreseeable future debating whether or not this decision was in the best interest of the health of our democracy. Meanwhile, millions of Americans suffering from actual pre-existing conditions face a more pressing issue: their health. Here at St. John’s Well Child and Family Center, we saw firsthand that California’s Republican representatives chose to abandon the best interests of their constituents ― and their democratic duty as representatives ― with a vote in favor of the American Health Care Act (AHCA). A decision that was absolutely not in the best interest of the health of our democracy.Despite vocal constituent opposition, every single California Republican representative voted to pass the bill. From clinic lobbies, St. John’s alone made over 500 calls to California’s GOP representatives leading up to the AHCA vote. We found that our representatives’ lines were often unanswered and few offices could accommodate Spanish speakers. However, one of the most disturbing responses our patients got was: “What is your zip code?” While the offices assured us they were asking to make sure the concerned callers were actual constituents of the respective representatives’ offices, their concern with zip codes should be mistaken for nothing less than valuing wealth over American health. Because they certainly have had no problem accepting donations from beyond their districts’ zip codes.California Republicans’ concern with zip codes does, however, shed light on the fact that life expectancy varies by up to 20 years based on where you live in the country ― a disparity which would be further exacerbated by the AHCA. In an analysis published Tuesday, Christopher Murray, the head of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington found that the life expectancy of U.S. residents living in “communities that are well-off and more highly educated” is about 20 years longer than those living in communities that are “poorer and less educated.” So, should 911 operators begin asking for zip codes to determine where it’s “worth” sending ambulances or provide life-saving services?Stealing the fundamental right to health care from the nation’s most vulnerable populations is a heartless way to give the top two percent a trillion dollar tax cut. Health care is a catalyst for social, racial, and economic justice ― and pricing people out of health care access via high-risk pools is an archaic, Darwinian euphemism for class and race-based control. In the medical world, we know that while an infection might be rooted in one specific part of the body, the symptoms are not restricted to the source of infection. In other words, a body is only as healthy as its most infected cell. Our democracy is no different. Lack of access to health care for anyone, anywhere is a symptom of an infected democracy ― one where wealth, not health decides how elected officials vote.The weeks to come will reveal the truth about the health of our democracy. It’s important to assess whether the decisions being made by our leaders are in the best interest of the American people. We cannot limit that debate to Comey’s firing. We must also call on our senators to demand that they protect the fundamental human right to health. Our democracy is only as healthy as the trust we can place in our political leaders and the lives we can save from drowning in high risk pools."

Sidibe explained that even though she was wearing Balenciaga shades and a vintage Chanel purse when she entered the store, the salesperson initially declined to help her find a pair of Chanel prescription frames. The person even went so far as to direct Sidibe to a discount store across the street. “Just to be sure of what was happening, I made her tell me to leave, in her pretend-polite way, three times,” Sidibe wrote.“I knew what she was doing,” she continued. “She had decided after a single look at me that I wasn’t there to spend any money. Even though I was carrying a Chanel bag, she decided I wasn’t a Chanel customer and so, not worth her time and energy.”And while Sidibe eventually did get assistance (after some other Chanel employees of color noticed her), the actress wrote that incidents like these have happened to her all her life, both before and after fame. They happen so much that she has come to expect bad service in stores and suspects it has to do with either her race, her size, or both. “As a successful adult, sometimes I walk out of the store in a huff, without getting what I want, denying them my hard-earned money,” Sidibe wrote.“Other times I spend my money in an unfriendly store as if to say ‘Fuck you! I’ll buy this whole damn store!’” she added. “Does it matter whether my waist is wide or if my skin is black as long as my money is green?”On Wednesday, Chanel issued a statement apologizing for the incident: “We took her words very seriously and immediately investigated to understand what happened, knowing that this is absolutely not in line with the high standards that Chanel wishes to provide to our customers.”"
34,POLITICS,Democrat Running For Virginia Governor Once Called Health Care ‘A Privilege',Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ralph-northam-virginia-health-care-right_us_5914c196e4b0031e737c3356,"Ralph Northam now calls it a ""right.""",2017-05-11,"Virginia Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam, seen here meeting with airport workers on March 8, 2017, is under fire from opponent Tom Perriello for once claiming health care is a ""privilege.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5914c3531500001f00db1df4.jpeg?cache=VKm4keCo8S&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Virginia Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam (D), who is seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, called health care “a privilege” during a debate six years ago, his opponent’s campaign revealed on Tuesday.Video of Northam in the 2011 debate, when he was running for re-election to the state Senate, shows him responding to a question asking whether he considers health care a “right,” or something best left to the “market or charity.” “I believe it’s a privilege,” Northam said in the video, circulated by former Rep. Tom Perriello (D-Va.), his rival in the gubernatorial primary. “And let me clarify that: If people can get up in the morning and go to work like I can, then it needs to be a privilege. They need to work for their health insurance, for their benefits. If they’re disabled, I will take the shirt off my back to help them.”Northam, a pediatric neurologist and Army veteran, now views “affordable health care” as a “right,” according to David Turner, a spokesman for his campaign.“Ralph Northam spent his life seeing patients as an Army doctor and a pediatrician, and he knows firsthand how important for people to be able to get the health care they need, when they need it,” Turner said in a statement. “He firmly believes that every American and Virginian has a right to affordable health care, and he believes it is the responsibility of government to make sure they do.” Turner also pointed to Northam’s advocacy for the expansion of Medicaid in Virginia, and co-sponsorship of legislation, as a state senator, that would have created a state-run Obamacare exchange in the state. In 2010, Northam was one of 17 state senators to vote against a bill getting rid of the individual mandate in Virginia. The revelation about Northam’s 2011 comments nonetheless lands a blow for Perriello, who has cast himself as the more progressive of the two candidates and emphasizes his support for health care reform in the wake of the House of Representatives’ passage of a controversial Obamacare replacement bill.In an advertisement released moments after the House passed the Trumpcare bill, Perriello stands in front of an ambulance being crushed in a compactor symbolizing GOP attempts to overturn health reform. Speaking over the loud noise of the compactor, he touts his vote for Obamacare as a congressman and promises to prevent a figurative ambulance-crushing scenario in Virginia.Perriello’s record on Obamacare, however, is not without its own significant blemish. In Congress, he voted for an amendment that would have prohibited insurance plans that covered abortion from receiving federal funding. The amendment temporarily obstructed the landmark bill’s passage, but was scrapped for an alternative compromise.Perriello has expressed “regret” for the vote, claiming he was honoring a promise to his constituents in his conservative central and Southside Virginia district. After failing to win re-election, largely thanks to his vote for Obamacare, Perriello went on to head the staunchly pro-choice Center for American Progress action fund.Perriello now supports repeal of the Hyde Amendment barring federal funds for abortion. As a gubernatorial candidate, he proposes insulating Virginia from a possible repeal of Roe v. Wade by amending Virginia’s constitution to make abortion an inviolable state-level right.For his part, Northam has a more pristine pro-choice legislative record, earning him the endorsement of NARAL Pro-Choice America.But he has admitted to twice voting for former President George W. Bush, who appointed two justices to the Supreme Court who oppose Roe v. Wade. Northam claimed he was not paying close attention to politics at the time.In a tight primary, where progressive bona fides have become a major source of contention, the dueling campaigns have offered a dizzying array of examples and counter-examples. On Tuesday, Northam’s team blasted out its own evidence of Perriello’s liberal heresies. It included the then-congressman’s 2010 boast that he voted with congressional Republicans 60 percent of the time, and 2009 comments in which Perriello played down his roots as a Democrat.Perriello spokesman Ian Sams hit back on Twitter with examples of Perriello’s pre-2009 involvement in Democratic politics.Northam, 57, enjoys the support of virtually the entire Virginia Democratic establishment, including Gov. Terry McAuliffe and Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine. He was a shoo-in for the Democratic nomination until Perriello, galvanized by President Donald Trump’s election, jumped into the race in January.Perriello, 42, who earned renown for embracing then-President Barack Obama’s agenda despite the political consequences during his brief stint in Congress, has brought the race to a virtual tie with his attempts to capitalize on anti-Trump energy among grassroots liberals.Northam has tacked to the left in response to the challenge, but Perriello is running on a more progressive platform. Perriello categorically opposes construction of two planned natural gas pipelines in Virginia, and refuses to take campaign contributions from Dominion Energy, the state’s largest power utility. Northam supports strict regulation, but has declined to come out against the pipeline projects.Those stances and others have won Perriello the endorsements of Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), as well as Our Revolution, the nonprofit successor to Sanders’ presidential campaign.The gubernatorial primary will take place on June 13, and the general election is on Nov. 7. The Republican front-runner is Ed Gillespie, former chairman of the Republican National Committee."

Launched six years into Syria’s civil war, the first direct American military action against the Syrian government came in response to a brazen chemical weapons attack allegedly carried out by the regime in the rebel-held Idlib province. On April 4, Syrian warplanes had pounded the town of Khan Sheikhoun with bombs that were suspected of carrying the nerve agent Sarin, which killed at least 89 civilians. The attack was considered one of the deadliest chemical attacks in Syria in years. Disturbing footage showed Syrian civilians, mostly women and children, struggling to breathe or foaming at their mouth. Other images of lifeless bodies, including the bodies of small children, prompted international outrage.Mohammed, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, lives with her children less than 100 miles from Khan Sheikhoun. She told HuffPost that the indiscriminate assault against civilians by the government had left her family traumatized in the days following the attack. The American strikes were a good start, she said, and she hoped Trump would follow up with even stronger action against Syrian President Bashar Assad. Weeks later, Mohammed was disappointed. “We can’t trust anyone,” she told the HuffPost on April 27, speaking in Arabic. “This strike was not nearly enough and not effective. Things have gone back to as they were. Civilians are still being targeted. Shops are being targeted. Hospitals are being targeted. There is no accountability. Trump didn’t do anything he said he would do. The massacres continue.”Trump’s decision to strike the Syrian regime air base yielded widespread praise from Western allies, many of whom had advocated for stronger use of military force in Syria in recent years. Reactions in the Middle East had been mixed. While Saudi Arabia proclaimed its full support for Trump’s “courageous decision,” Assad-ally Iran expressed disgust at the military action.The Trump administration has maintained that its strike was never intended to halt Syria’s conflict or stop the use of conventional weapons, but rather to send a message Assad and its ally Russia. “The strike was a message to Bashar al-Assad that your multiple violations of your agreements at the U.N., your agreements under the chemical weapons charter back in 2013, that those would not go without a response in the future,” Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos on April 9.That reality turned initial hopes into disillusionment for some Syrians, including Mohammed who had been waiting throughout the six-year war for the world to take decisive action against Assad.The American strikes last month changed little on the ground. Russian and Syrian jets have carried out airstrikes in the days following the U.S. attack, including reported bombings in the same Idlib town where the toxic gas killed scores. Days after the U.S. strikes, Ibrahim Dallou, a Syrian refugee who resettled in Atlanta, Georgia in July 2016, praised Trump for “putting an end to the tyrants of the world.” Dallou had been extremely disappointed by the previous Obama administration’s reluctance to take direct action against Assad, despite the rising civilian death toll. “It was on the U.S. government to do this since President Barack Obama,” Dallou told HuffPost in April. Obama had been wary of the effectiveness of one-off strikes and was reluctant to involve the U.S. much deeper into the conflict. U.S. policy under the Obama administration in Syria had instead primarily been focused on attacking the self-described Islamic State and offering support to Kurdish militias. Dallou hoped Trump’s airstrikes were a sign of a new U.S. strategy in Syria, one that instead focused on Assad.“This strike is a powerful signal the United States of America [is] standing alongside humanity and justice,” Dallou said, praising Trump’s departure from previous policy. But last week, Dallou said he was frustrated and disheartened with what has happened since - the civilian death toll has continued to rise.Omar al-Muqdad, a journalist and documentary filmmaker who was imprisoned by the Assad regime and now lives in Arkansas, echoed Dallou’s hope that Trump would go further than the tomahawk strikes and “exert some serious pressure on the Russians and Iranians in order to remove Assad from power.” More than a month later, al-Muqdad calls the American strikes a “show attack.”“It was just an attack for media use, that’s all, because he’d been accused of being a Russian puppet for a while,” al-Muqdad said. “What’s the purpose of that attack if you’re not going to make some radical changes regarding these matters?”It’s unclear where exactly the Trump administration stands on the future of Assad. Nikki Haley, the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. has said repeatedly there can be no peace in Syria with Assad in power. However, the secretary of state has flip-flopped on the subject several times. While Tillerson said on April 9 that Assad’s future would be decided by the Syrian people, he told top diplomats two days later that “ the reign of the Assad family is coming to an end.”Mohammed said last month she wanted the U.S., the U.N. and the international community to stop Assad and take him to court. So far, Trump “hasn’t done a thing that’s helped” their cause, she said. “We are so scared. We heard there are still gas attacks that can kill us. We are traumatized,” Mohammed said. The day of the chemical attack on Khan Sheikhoun was “really hard,” she explained. When she heard the planes go by to strike, she didn’t know the planes carried chemical bombs. “People began to go underground,” she recounted. “People still in their homes were trying to rescue their family members and relatives. ... Children died.”“We were hoping for better,” she said. “We are still being promised that things will change. We lost hope.”"

Days after the U.S. strikes, Ibrahim Dallou, a Syrian refugee who resettled in Atlanta, Georgia in July 2016, praised Trump for “putting an end to the tyrants of the world.” Dallou had been extremely disappointed by the previous Obama administration’s reluctance to take direct action against Assad, despite the rising civilian death toll. “It was on the U.S. government to do this since President Barack Obama,” Dallou told HuffPost in April. Obama had been wary of the effectiveness of one-off strikes and was reluctant to involve the U.S. much deeper into the conflict. U.S. policy under the Obama administration in Syria had instead primarily been focused on attacking the self-described Islamic State and offering support to Kurdish militias. Dallou hoped Trump’s airstrikes were a sign of a new U.S. strategy in Syria, one that instead focused on Assad.“This strike is a powerful signal the United States of America [is] standing alongside humanity and justice,” Dallou said, praising Trump’s departure from previous policy. But last week, Dallou said he was frustrated and disheartened with what has happened since - the civilian death toll has continued to rise.Omar al-Muqdad, a journalist and documentary filmmaker who was imprisoned by the Assad regime and now lives in Arkansas, echoed Dallou’s hope that Trump would go further than the tomahawk strikes and “exert some serious pressure on the Russians and Iranians in order to remove Assad from power.” More than a month later, al-Muqdad calls the American strikes a “show attack.”“It was just an attack for media use, that’s all, because he’d been accused of being a Russian puppet for a while,” al-Muqdad said. “What’s the purpose of that attack if you’re not going to make some radical changes regarding these matters?”It’s unclear where exactly the Trump administration stands on the future of Assad. Nikki Haley, the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. has said repeatedly there can be no peace in Syria with Assad in power. However, the secretary of state has flip-flopped on the subject several times. While Tillerson said on April 9 that Assad’s future would be decided by the Syrian people, he told top diplomats two days later that “ the reign of the Assad family is coming to an end.”Mohammed said last month she wanted the U.S., the U.N. and the international community to stop Assad and take him to court. So far, Trump “hasn’t done a thing that’s helped” their cause, she said. “We are so scared. We heard there are still gas attacks that can kill us. We are traumatized,” Mohammed said. The day of the chemical attack on Khan Sheikhoun was “really hard,” she explained. When she heard the planes go by to strike, she didn’t know the planes carried chemical bombs. “People began to go underground,” she recounted. “People still in their homes were trying to rescue their family members and relatives. ... Children died.”“We were hoping for better,” she said. “We are still being promised that things will change. We lost hope.”"

Mike Ritze, would let ICE officials question about 82,000 schoolchildren to determine if they are citizens, according to The Associated Press.Ritze also questioned why non-citizens should have the opportunity for an education in the U.S.“Identify them and then turn them over to ICE to see if they truly are citizens. And do we really have to educate non-citizens?” Ritze told News 9. (Under federal law, children have a right to attend public school regardless of immigration status. They also have the right to apply for student aid if they meet certain conditions.) The 22-member Republican Platform Caucus, which represents about a third of the 74 Republicans in the 101-member House, estimated the idea would save $60 million. But not all members seemed to be on board. Rep. Chuck Strohm and House Floor Leader Jon Echols were dismissive of the idea in an interview with the AP.“On this subject of deporting students, that is not a position that we support,” Strohm, co-chairman of the caucus, told AP. “This caught many of us by surprise, because that’s not the direction that we talked about.”“I have no desire to target [non-English speaking] students,” Echols said. “That’s a bad idea.”The idea is “disgustingly inhumane,” Ryan Kiesel of the ACLU of Oklahoma told the AP. Ritze is perhaps best known for erecting a 2,000-pound granite block of the Ten Commandments on the grounds of the state Capitol in 2012. It was riddled with spelling errors. Ritze paid $10,000 for the statue, which was later removed.Ritze’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment by HuffPost.Clarification: Language has been amended to clarify that certain conditions must be met by noncitizen immigrants to qualify for financial aid."

It will be the first time the men meet in person after trading insults on social media and in interviews over the last year.TVBoy imagined the meeting going something like: “Angel Francis forgives the Devil Trump in Rome just before the G7,” the artist wrote on Instagram, referring to the summit of world powers the president will attend in Italy.Perhaps, TVBoy.

That changed this week as part of a class project.Oliveira, a sophomore, is taking a Gay, Lesbian and Transgender Studies class, the first offered by the Catholic university, which competes athletically in the NAIA. The students in the class were assigned a project with the task of doing something to help the LGBT community.With the help of classmates and fellow athletes Indira Colón (track and field), Scott Fabian (volleyball) and Bernabe Montes (soccer) — all who identify as straight — Oliveira decided to come out publicly to show that LGBT athletes are accepted on campus.The result is a terrific 22-minute podcast the four did for their class project, where they explore Oliveira’s story and the state of LGBT athletes. It’s a creative and engaging way to do a class project. They sent me the audio file and I uploaded it to YouTube and it’s worth your while.All four all well-spoken and hit all areas of the subject, including locker room showers and how Oliveira was accepted by his Cardinal Stritch teammates. You can listen hereOliveira has come a long way since he first emailed Outsports a year ago, telling us about his background in Brazil, his coming to the U.S. to study and his hopes to connect with other LGBT athletes. He was not out publicly and did not feel comfortable sharing his story at that time. He attended the Outsports Reunion last July in Chicago and fit right in. During the Olympics in his native Brazil, he wrote a column on being a gay athlete in that country using only his first name.Via Facebook, I asked Oliveira about why he decided to use his class project to come out publicly.How did the project come about?We did this project because are members of a Catholic university and we were having the opportunity to speak up for the ones that might not feel ready to come out yet. We wanted to show them that they have a support system and that it is not a reason to be ashamed or feel scared.Why did you decide to share your story as part of the project?I was a volleyball player in Brazil for several years and I have seen how it is like to be both an out and a closeted player over there. I love my country, but homophobia in sports is still a conversation that is nor discussed as often as it should be. We don’t have a single and out proud gay soccer player over there, and I think this is something that proves how it can be really be scary and also dangerous to come out as gay in a country with such a masculine culture like Brazil.What has been your experience as an openly gay student-athlete on campus?I am me. I finally can be myself and there is nothing better than being able to be live your own truth and not being worried about what people think or talk about me.What are your goals for this project?We hope that this project can help gay athletes speak up and try to make the difference in their own institutions like we are trying to do. We had the chance to make this project and we really wanted to help promote the change, so future generations that come to our institution know that three straight and one gay athlete got together and started a conversation that might have promoted a safe place for them to be who they are with no fear.Felipe Oliveira can be reached via email (augusto8felipe@gmail.com), on Instagram(@16feaugusto) or Facebook.For more from OutSports, check out these stories:Slurs are a hazard for gay players in mainstream rec leaguesBisexual college athlete leaves legacy of LGBT leadership in IndianaThis gay athlete held a secret unlike most others"
44,ARTS & CULTURE,Nationwide Art Project Is Making Space For Historic Women In All 50 States,Priscilla Frank,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/olek-crochet-women-portrait_us_591345f6e4b050bdca61a7a4,“I want to honor women who fought their entire lives to open the doors for women like me. Women who still don’t have enough space in history books.”,2017-05-11,"Crochet piece with Olek at SewGreen Rochester in Rochester, New York, on May 7.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591379e41500002000db1ab0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"Just before the presidential election in November 2016, Polish-American artist Olek revealed which candidate was getting her vote by hanging a massive portrait of Hillary Clinton over a New Jersey highway. Upon closer inspection, what initially appeared to be a billboard was actually ― in Olek’s signature style ― a 16-by-46-foot neon pink blanket, entirely crocheted by hand. Days later, Olek, like the rest of the world, learned that Clinton had lost the election and Donald Trump was to be president of the United States. “I immediately thought, I wish I had done more,” Olek told HuffPost in a phone call. “Then I thought: ‘Wait a second, I still can.’”Olek, born Agata Oleksiak, moved to the United States from Poland in 2003 and describes herself as a “young American and an old Pole” accordingly. At 38 years old, she is known for her experimental yarn creations, which combine the art of crochet ― with its traditional connotations of domestic “women’s work” ― with the tactics of guerrilla street art.Her most iconic creations, or “yarn bombs” as they’re often dubbed, include covering the Wall Street bull sculpture with pink and purple camouflage and crocheting a massive fictionalized edition of The New York Times. Olek’s current project is as much about the process of its creation as the final result. Titled “Love Across the USA,” the piece will consist of 50 portraits of women who changed American history, displayed throughout all 50 states. “I want to honor women who fought their entire lives to open the doors for women like me,” Olek said. “Women who still don’t have enough space in history books.”The artist will travel from state to state until 2020, inviting local community members to help create each work. This community collaboration is where the real impact of Olek’s project takes place.“We’re living in a time when people are stuck to their computers,” she said. “I want to get people out of their homes, out of their habits. Community is so important. I’m getting people together.”Olek isn’t sure exactly which women she will honor throughout the series, although she mentioned Nina Simone, Sojourner Truth and Michelle Obama as some names on her list. She plans to honor women who are significant to each state, hopefully illuminating some lesser-known heroines who have not been sufficiently recognized on a national stage. An inkling of Olek’s idea for the project emerged on election day, when Olek noticed viral photos and videos of women attaching their “I Voted” stickers to Susan B. Anthony’s grave in Rochester, New York. “It made me think, in the year 2020, women will only have been able to vote in this country for 100 years,” Olek said. “I knew I had to start with Susan B. Anthony.” In March, coinciding with Women’s History Month, Olek made the trek to Rochester to begin the project. She reached out for volunteers on social media beforehand, inviting crochet masters and novices alike to join her in the process. Over 200 volunteers gathered at the Schweinfurth Art Center in Auburn, New York, where Olek held a crochet workshop for anyone interested in learning the basics.Using donated materials from Red Heart Yarn, each participant constructed a two-by-two-foot square, following a pattern Olek distributed. The squares were then combined to yield a towering portrait of a feminist icon. Susan B. Anthony ended up being Olek’s second subject; the first, whose image was hung in early May, depicts abolitionist Harriet Tubman. “I couldn’t choose, I had to do both,” Olek said. Alongside Tubman’s face reads the quote: “Slavery is the next thing to hell,” written against a shocking pink backdrop. Anthony’s portrait, currently in the works, will be revealed later in the month.“I could not choose between Harriet and Susan,” Olek told HuffPost, adding that she “broke her rule” by choosing two subjects. The artist hopes to create at least one portrait in all 50 states but clearly is not opposed to adapting her mission along the way. Olek described her experience working with local crocheters in Rochester as “incredibly powerful.” She described working with collaborators in their 70s, who had been crocheting since before Olek was born, who worked late nights that creeped into mornings. She described working with fathers and sons who had never crocheted before, yet were eager to learn and help. The project is open to men and women of all political views. While crocheting together for hours on end, Olek explained, the volunteers often communicate about the many challenges of living in 2017. “We talk about what it means to be a women, what it means to support women,” Olek said. “We talk about health care, family, education. People form new friendships.”Beyond the physical existence of the works, it is the intimate experience of working with strangers that brings Olek the most pride. “Making pieces in my studio is not the same as going into the world,” she said. “I see the effect, how public art can change people. It’s not only about seeing the piece, but the impact the work has on the community.”Although the project was triggered in part by the election, Olek doesn’t describe her piece as explicitly political. “I want to go to red states, I want to go everywhere,” she explained. “Often artists don’t go to the smaller places, those are often the places that need us. Those people are equally important to the democracy of this country.”Eventually, Olek hopes to develop a computer program that can help individuals create their own crochet patterns. Then they too can pay homage to the women who inspire them, by printing patters and crocheting from there. When describing how she landed upon her title for the ambitious endeavor, “Love Across the USA,” Olek recalled her experience preparing for the Women’s March in Washington, D.C., this January and deciding which sign to take with her. “I had this older piece in my studio that said, ‘Love Always Wins. Haha Not Really,’” she said.“But then I realized, the times we live in are really bad. I can’t be sarcastic anymore. I ripped the last line from my piece and took ‘Love Always Wins’ to the march at D.C. I think love is so powerful it can conquer anything.” Follow “Love Across the USA” on Facebook to keep updated with Olek’s work and volunteer in your hometown.

Schwab has been working as a volunteer in the White House Office of Legislative Affairs this spring.

The White House won’t say why Schwab was hired, or give details on her work for the Trump administration. HuffPost learned of Schwab’s job from a source, who shared correspondence between Schwab’s official White House email account and congressional offices. The header on Schwab’s White House email address says “Volunteer” in parentheses after her name, suggesting she may not be a full-time staffer. She is not an official White House intern. This is what her email looks like:It’s generally illegal for federal agencies to use unpaid labor, with a few notable exceptions. These include the prestigious (but unpaid) White House internship program, as well as a volunteer program to decorate the White House for holiday tours. Schwab’s billionaire grandfather founded the eponymous brokerage firm in 1971 and contributed $1 million to Trump’s record-breaking inaugural fundraising committee. HuffPost contacted him for comment through his family foundation, but did not receive a reply.Samantha Schwab attended the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland as part of the California delegation. She is an undergraduate at Stanford University in California, where a student directory lists her major as economics. Her grandfather, who supported Jeb Bush in the 2016 GOP presidential primary, holds a Stanford economics degree.Samantha Schwab would appear to be eligible for the White House internship program. But the first class of Trump White House interns doesn’t start until May 30. Applications were due in April, and Schwab has been at the legislative affairs office since at least March, according to her emails. Schwab, reached by phone Tuesday, said she did not have time to talk, and asked HuffPost to call later. Subsequent calls were diverted to an operator, and messages were not returned. HuffPost also sent detailed questions about Schwab’s job to the White House, but did not receive a response. Ethics experts said Schwab’s position raises a number of red flags, including the same issues Ivanka Trump encountered during her brief stint as a “volunteer” adviser to her father, the president.Schwab’s “volunteer” position, and the administration’s secrecy about it, are “highly unusual and reeking of patronage,” said Richard Painter, who served as former President George W. Bush’s ethics czar. In order to address potential conflicts of interest, Schwab should formally agree to ethics rules for all White House employees, regardless of whether she is being paid, Painter added.“If someone has a White House email and they’re coming into work every day and corresponding with congressional offices, then they are an employee,” Painter said. “Nobody can just go into a White House job and say they’re a volunteer and not be subject to ethics rules.”The practice of giving jobs to relatives of important donors is hardly a new phenomenon in Washington. In 2013, then-President Barack Obama’s summer intern class Included children of billionaire campaign donor Steven Rattner and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers.But what’s new in the Trump administration is a widespread tolerance for conflicts of interest, worsened by a lack of transparency that includes Trump’s failure to disclose his tax returns and his refusal to make public White House visitor logs. Schwab’s position also raises the question of whether it violates the Antideficiency Act, a law that prohibits the federal government from accepting volunteer services. The purpose of the law is to ensure that if the president wants to hire more people, he must ask Congress, which appropriates money for Executive Branch personnel. “There’s a special exception made to the Antideficiency rules for education-based internships, like the White House internship program,” said Kathleen Clark, a law professor and government ethics expert at Washington University in St Louis. “But if you didn’t have the exception, what you’d have here is the Executive Branch using unpaid labor, which is not accountable to Congress.”Cases like Schwab’s also reveal larger and more systemic ethics issues within the administration, said Alex Howard, of the nonprofit Sunlight Foundation.“By deciding to lift the traditional caps on inaugural donations and accept unlimited amounts from each individual, Trump opened himself up to questions like this one,” Howard said in an interview. Howard, a former HuffPost reporter, also emphasized how valuable working in the White House is for a young person’s career. “The White House is the top of our executive branch, and it is unrivaled in terms of prestige, power and influence,” Howard said. “So the things [staffers] learn, and the connections they make are basically priceless.“But when someone is given this incredibly valuable experience in secret, because of their family’s political contributions, it erodes the public trust in the entire government,” he said."

Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.), who helped revive efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, on Wednesday became the latest Republican lawmaker to face angry voters at a town hall, just days after he voted for a House bill that would make sweeping changes to the nation’s health care system.Appearing at a community center in a Democratic pocket of his New Jersey district, MacArthur fielded questions for nearly five hours from a loud and feisty crowd about his role in crafting the GOP health care bill and its effect on the insurance marketplace. A few constituents also demanded that he call for a special prosecutor to investigate whether President Donald Trump’s aides colluded with Russia during the presidential campaign.Throughout, MacArthur defended the so-called American Health Care Act over boos and jeers from constituents, many of whom charged that the congressman would have blood on his hands if the bill becomes law. Several times during the event, MacArthur struggled to retain control of the room, getting shouted down even as he told the story of the 1996 death of his 11-year-old daughter, who was born with special needs.“I’m asking you guys to have some respect,” he pleaded exasperatedly at one point.“Can I be disrespectful on behalf of all the people you’re gonna kill?” responded one constituent who was angry over the health care vote. Last month, MacArthur authored an amendment that helped bring a substantial number of House conservatives on board to the GOP health care bill, leading to its eventual passage last week. The provisions of the so-called MacArthur amendment would allow states to waive essential benefits such as maternity care and emergency room visits. It would also allow states to opt out of Obamacare’s community rating rules, which require that insurers charge the same price to consumers in a certain area regardless of gender or pre-existing condition.“It was dead in the water until you revived it,” said Derek Reichenbecher, 38, who has a heart condition. “This is my life. Without health care coverage, I’m dead. I’m dead.”The bill passed the House, 217 to 213, with all Democrats and 20 Republicans voting against it, and is now in the Senate’s hands. In another exchange, MacArthur cast his role in helping craft the bill as not allowing perfect be the enemy of the good ― arguing that members of Congress don’t always “vote on the bill they wish was in front of them.” But the line failed to quell his constituents, who booed and shouted him down once more.“You submitted it! You were an architect!” one person yelled, referring to his amendment.MacArthur repeatedly insisted that no one with pre-existing conditions will be declined coverage or priced out of being able to buy coverage under the GOP health care bill. He argued that moving people with pre-existing conditions out of the private insurance system and into high-risk pools would preserve the status quo.“When people are in the risk pools, then everyone else’s insurance [premium] comes down,” he said.“How do you know without a CBO score?” shouted a member of the crowd, referring to House’s rush to pass the bill before the Congressional Budget Office could evaluate its costs and effects.MacArthur repeatedly declined to give a yes or no answer in two separate exchanges on whether the GOP health care bill classifies rape as a pre-existing condition.“You cannot be charged more or denied coverage. I will not reduce [rape] to calling it a pre-existing condition,” he told a high school student. “My amendment doesn’t do that.”When a constituent called the GOP health care bill a giveaway to the wealthiest Americans, who stand to receive $594 billion in tax cuts over 10 years, MacArthur pushed back by claiming that all Americans would receive a tax cut under the plan.“This isn’t tax cuts for the rich. This is tax cuts for everyone,” he said.Aside from health care, which dominated much of the discussion, voters at the town hall appeared to be concerned about the president’s decision to fire FBI Director James Comey. They urged MacArthur and other Republicans to stand up to the president and call for an independent investigation into Comey’s ouster and the Trump campaign’s possible ties to Russia.“A special prosecutor is appointed by the president’s attorney general. I don’t see that as some silver bullet,” MacArthur said, adding he wanted to give the House and Senate Intelligence committees an opportunity to investigate the matter.“We don’t oversee the executive,” he added, earning a round of loud boos from the audience. “Congress is not the board of directors of the White House.”Outside the building, dozens of people gathered to protest MacArthur and the health care bill. They carried signs that read, “Killer Tom,” “Health care, not wealth care,” and “Stop Twitler now” ― a reference to the president and his active Twitter account. A group of demonstrators also held a “die-in” to protest the health care bill.

I can’t believe in this country we’re going to ignore health care for people,” Robert Gogats, a constituent of MacArthur’s who identified himself as a registered Republican, told HuffPost.Kim Hicks, another Republican who stood in line for the event, criticized MacArthur for presenting himself as a moderate member of the GOP.“It’s not true at all,” Hicks said. “It’s just a cruel policy. The whole bill is cruel. There’s no compassion in it. He’s such a hypocrite.

Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.), who helped revive efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, on Wednesday became the latest Republican lawmaker to face angry voters at a town hall, just days after he voted for a House bill that would make sweeping changes to the nation’s health care system.Appearing at a community center in a Democratic pocket of his New Jersey district, MacArthur fielded questions for nearly five hours from a loud and feisty crowd about his role in crafting the GOP health care bill and its effect on the insurance marketplace. A few constituents also demanded that he call for a special prosecutor to investigate whether President Donald Trump’s aides colluded with Russia during the presidential campaign.Throughout, MacArthur defended the so-called American Health Care Act over boos and jeers from constituents, many of whom charged that the congressman would have blood on his hands if the bill becomes law. Several times during the event, MacArthur struggled to retain control of the room, getting shouted down even as he told the story of the 1996 death of his 11-year-old daughter, who was born with special needs.“I’m asking you guys to have some respect,” he pleaded exasperatedly at one point.“Can I be disrespectful on behalf of all the people you’re gonna kill?” responded one constituent who was angry over the health care vote.

48,POLITICS,Donald Trump’s Pick For Trade Representative Creates Unusual Alliances,Daniel Marans and Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-robert-lighthizer-bipartisanship_us_59147c01e4b066b42171d209,Some Republicans opposed and some Democrats favored Robert Lighthizer for the post.,2017-05-11,"Robert Lighthizer testifies in a Senate Finance Committee confirmation hearing on his nomination to be U.S. trade representative on March 14, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59147d3d1e00002800622811.jpeg?cache=pn1blJNqDH&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump’s trade agenda continues to scramble American party politics.The U.S. Senate on Thursday confirmed Robert Lighthizer, Trump’s nominee for U.S. trade representative, in an 82-14 vote. The vote did not break down along neat partisan lines: Three Republicans voted against him and 36 members of the Senate Democratic caucus joined other Republicans in voting for him.The unusual final tally reflects the way in which Trump’s trade skepticism has the power to win him unlikely allies and enemies.A leading trade policy hawk, Lighthizer was one of the last Cabinet-level officials awaiting confirmation. His selection in January elicited praise from many liberal economists, and the Senate Finance Committee unanimously voted to send his nomination to the Senate floor in late April. The last-minute spending bill Congress passed last week included a provision that paved the way for Lighthizer’s confirmation by giving him an exemption from restrictions on nominees who have lobbied for foreign governments in the past.Trump hasn’t followed through on the dramatic trade promises he made during his campaign, which the president has occasionally blamed on delays to Lighthizer’s confirmation.But in the run-up to the final vote, Lighthizer’s confirmation encountered opposition from members of Trump’s own party. Two Republican senators, John McCain (Ariz.) and Ben Sasse (Neb.), came out against Lighthizer’s nomination on Wednesday because of his views against the North American Free Trade Agreement. A third, Sen. Cory Gardner (Colo.), also ultimately voted nay. Without Democratic support, those three defections would have been enough to sink Lighthizer’s confirmation.“A constant theme throughout your confirmation process has been your failure to grasp the importance of protecting agriculture in trade negotiations,” Sasse and McCain wrote in a letter to Lighthizer, noting that the nominee had failed to put Sasse at ease on the agriculture question in a private meeting.“America needs a USTR who will effectively defend agriculture during trade negotiations and fight to expand agricultural export markets, not let America’s farmers and ranchers become collateral damage in a trade war,” Sasse and McCain wrote. The agriculture sector is particularly worried about upending the trade status quo because American farmers sell a ton of crops for export. While the U.S. as a whole has been running half-trillion-dollar trade deficits with other countries, agriculture has actually boasted a surplus since the 1960s. At the same time, low prices for commodities like corn and wheat have sharply reduced farm incomes in recent years, causing some farmers to worry they’re on the brink of a farm depression like one that happened in the early 1980s in large part because farmers lost access to a foreign commodity market.Eleven members of the Senate Democratic caucus joined McCain, Sasse and Gardner in voting against Lighthizer. The Democrats were Sens. Richard Blumenthal (Conn.), Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.), Kamala Harris (Calif.), Ed Markey (Mass.), Jeff Merkley (Ore.), Jack Reed (R.I.), Brian Schatz (Hawaii), Chuck Schumer (N.Y.), Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (R.I.).Vermont independent Bernie Sanders, an ardent foe of recent international trade agreements who caucuses with Democrats, also opposed Lighthizer’s confirmation on the grounds that he was insufficiently committed to overhauling the nation’s trade policies.“He refused to include more people who represent unions, environmentalists, and human rights advocates on trade advisory panels,” Sanders spokesman Josh Miller-Lewis said in a statement that cited a litany of other disappointments. “Right now, corporate interests represent 85% of the administration’s trade advisory system.”What was perhaps more notable was how many Democrats vocally backed Lighthizer hours before the vote took place. Spokespeople for Sens. Debbie Stabenow (Mich.) and Sherrod Brown (Ohio) both confirmed to HuffPost earlier in the day that the senators planned to approve Lighthizer. Brown, a trade critic from manufacturing-heavy Ohio, had long signaled his support for the nominee, going so far as to introduce him at his Senate Finance Committee hearing.On Thursday morning, Wisconsin Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin also announced her support for the confirmation. Baldwin has been outspoken in her opposition to a Canadian restriction on imports of ultrafiltered milk, a U.S.-produced dairy product used to make cheese that U.S. dairy farmers had been exporting to Canada. Baldwin cited her concerns about the trade dispute in her statement in support of Lighthizer’s confirmation.“In Wisconsin, there is an immediate need for the Trump Administration to follow through on the promises that have been made to our workers and dairy farmers,” Baldwin said in a statement. “Our agriculture economy has been hurt by Canada’s restrictive trade barriers and we need action to ensure our dairy farmers are not put out of business by trade politics and dairy policies set in Canada.”She added that “unfair trade deals, like NAFTA, have cost our Wisconsin economy manufacturing jobs. I have long opposed this flawed trade deal and support renegotiating it.”Baldwin and Senate Minority Leader Schumer (D-N.Y.), who nonetheless voted against Lighthizer, had already voiced support for Trump’s stance against the Canadian dairy rule. New York is also a major exporter of ultrafiltered milk to Canada.“There are plenty of things we can do that will put a lot of pressure on Canada,” Schumer told USA Today on April 19. “Some are administrative, some are legislative, and I’ll work with the Trump administration on both.”This article has been updated with details from the full Senate vote on Lighthizer’s confirmation."
49,POLITICS,Trump Announces Commission To Investigate His Baseless Widespread Voter Fraud Claim,Sam Levine,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-voter-fraud-investigation_us_591465f6e4b030d4f1f03d26,The new commission's chairman has pushed one of the most restrictive voting laws in the country.,2017-05-11,President Donald Trump has appointed Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R) to be the vice chair of his commission to investigate voter fraud and suppression. Kobach is being sued over a proof of citizenship requirement in a restrictive voting law he's been pushing.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591495121500002000db1d1d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday to establish a commission to investigate voter fraud.The move, which ABC News first reported, comes months after Trump claimed he would have won the popular vote had it not been for voter fraud. He has claimed that between 3 million and 5 million people voted illegally in last year’s presidential election. There is no evidence to support his claim. Several investigations, including multiple post-election audits, have found that while voter fraud does sometimes happen, it is extremely rare.The commission, which will be chaired by Vice President Mike Pence and have Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R) as its vice chair, will review policies and practices that enhance or undermine the American people’s confidence in the integrity of federal elections ― including improper registrations, improper voting, fraudulent registrations, fraudulent voting and voting suppression, according to the White House.However, the text of the order, which is formally called the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, says it will study the “laws, rules, policies, activities, strategies, and practices.” It does not specifically mention voter suppression or barriers to voting. Voting rights groups condemned the commission, saying it was an effort to distract from Trump’s decision to abruptly fire FBI Director James Comey amid its investigation into alleged ties between Trump and Russia, and possible Russian interference in the 2016 election.Michael Waldman, president of the Brennan Center for Justice, called the commission a “sham and distraction” in an effort to try and find proof of the president’s “absurd” voter fraud claim.“It tries to pivot from the fact that this week Trump fired the chief law enforcement officer in charge of probing whether his advisors colluded with Russia to influence our elections,” Waldman said. “He fired the person investigating a real threat to election integrity, and set up a probe of an imaginary threat.” Common Cause President Karen Hobert Flynn also questioned the timing of the commission launch. “To investigate any election problems at this juncture while denying and ignoring the Russian attack on the presidential election ... is irresponsible and a slap in the face to the American people who want and deserve to know what happened,” she said.While the committee is formally tasked with investigating both voter fraud and suppression, Kobach’s appointment sends a clear signal that it will be focused on fraud. The White House has pointed to Kobach to back up its claims of voter fraud before, but the Kansas Secretary of State has stumbled when trying to do so. Kobach pushed one of the most restrictive voting laws in the country, which requires Kansas residents to show proof of citizenship when they register to vote and photo ID when they go to the polls. If residents could not prove properly provide proof of citizenship, they were placed on a “suspense list” for 90 days and then purged from the voter rolls. A report by the Kansas Advisory Committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights this year said that the 2011 law “may have been written and implemented with improper, discriminatory intent.” In his testimony to the panel, Kobach said the only burden the photo ID requirement could possibly impose was exerting calories when reaching for a wallet to pull out identification.Kobach is being sued for the proof of citizenship requirement, which critics say creates an unnecessary obstacle to voting and discourages low-income, elderly and minority residents, who might not easily have access to the required documentation, from voting. Last year, a federal appeals court blocked Kansas from implementing the proof of citizenship requirement.Like Trump, Kobach has suggested there is widespread voter fraud. But despite having the power to prosecute voter fraud since 2011, Kobach has overseen the conviction of just nine people for voter fraud.Hobert Flynn said it’s “insulting that the new commission is headed by two champions of voter suppression ― Mike Pence and Kris Kobach. “It is hard to believe that any ‘findings’ of this commission headed by those individuals will do anything but condone and seek to justify voter suppression efforts,” she said.Allegra Chapman, director of voting and elections at Common Cause, said having Kobach at the helm was “laughable.”“He has tried time and again to put into place restrictive voting measures in Kansas and more often that not he loses when people file suit,” Chapman said. “Once again, this whole move is a charade.” The commission won’t be the first federal effort to examine voter fraud. Under then-President George W. Bush, the Department of Justice spent five years looking at voter fraud after similar allegations that it was widespread and found just 120 people had been charged and that 86 had been convicted.Trump thundered about voter fraud immediately after the election, seemingly stewing over the fact that he lost the popular vote. During his early days in office, he repeatedly said he believed fraud was widespread, but had gone quiet on the topic in recent months.“To launch an election commission at any time on voter fraud would be throwing away resources in a search for mythical creatures ― problems that don’t exist ― while failing to address the real problems in our elections systems: suppressive tactics,” Hobert Flynn said.Chapman said the commission is “akin to launching missile strikes with the hopes of getting popularity points.”“There’s just no there there,” he added. “But they’ll try to put on a big show over a so-called widespread problem that doesn’t exist.”Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said in February he didn’t think federal money should go toward a voter fraud probe. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said in January that while he had not seen any evidence to support Trump’s fraud claims, he thought an investigation was fine. White House deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Thursday announced five members of the panel, which she said will eventually have about a dozen members. The members announced Thursday were Indiana Secretary of State Connie Lawson (R), New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner (D), Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap (D), former Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell (R) and Christy McCormick, a commissioner on the Electoral Assistance Commission.This article has been updated with details from the text of the executive order, as well as comment from Chapman, Flynn, Waldman and Sanders.

People received emails with what looked almost exactly like shared Google Docs, tricking them into granting access to a not-particularly-nice piece of software. From there, the attack could spread to other inboxes.It’s far from the first time users have been attacked through their inboxes and it certainly won’t be the last — sending emails is an easy and low-cost way to fool people into letting their guard down. With that in mind, we’re here to make sure your inbox is tightly buttoned up against phishing attempts, malicious attachments, and more. While we can’t guarantee your safety, these precautions will certainly minimize your risk.Gone phishingYour email of choice, whether Gmail’s web portal or a desktop program like Outlook, already comes with a decent set of security tools. For example, it can snag suspicious emails and automatically toss them into your spam folder. To help out your email client, report spam whenever you find it, which will make it easier for the program to spot something untoward next time.Be wary of any email asking you to click a link, especially if it comes out of the blue without any context — and particularly if it comes from someone you don’t know. Phishing emails can appear to come from trusted contacts, but they often arrive from bizarre-sounding email addresses. To double-check the identity of the sender, and pull up the full header information for suspicious emails. To do this in Gmail, for instance, open the drop-down menu for the message then choose Show original.Unfortunately, even a message that comes from a known contact with the correct email address isn’t necessarily safe. As we’ve said, if one of your friends or family members is hit by a phishing attack, then their valid email address can be used to send you a dangerous message. This means that context is key. Were you expecting a message with a link in it? Does the message make sense? If you’re unsure, it’s worth a quick phone call or message over social media to check the email is what it purports to be. Ask the same questions before opening attachments: Were you expecting them? What’s the context?Hackers are getting better with their craft, but spelling errors and awkward layouts are still tell-tale signs of emails you should steer clear of (the spelling errors are often intentionally left in to evade spam detectors). Another check you can do is to hover over any links or attachments, which might bring up a preview, and alert you to potential problems before you click.If you do click on a link, check that the URL in your browser’s address bar is the one you were expecting, and look for the green padlock symbol that shows the site is secure and trusted. If a sign-in page pops up — or if you’re in any doubt — open a new window and directly type in the URL of the site you think you should be going to, rather than following any embedded links.Browser extensions can also help protect you from phishing attacks. Gmail Sender Icons makes it easier to identify where a message has come from, while Google’s own Password Alert warns you if you’re about to enter your Google account password into a site that isn’t made by Google. Both extensions are well worth installing if you have a Gmail account and use the Chrome browser. Not a Gmail or Chrome user? Look for add-ons for your own email client.Take safety beyond your inboxProtecting against shady links and malicious attachments goes beyond your inbox. For example, most modern-day browsers come with built-in security measures designed to thwart phishing attempts. For best results, make sure your browser of choice is kept up to date at all times (thankfully, browsers usually update automatically).Keep your operating system and your antivirus package up to date as well. If you're using an antivirus program on Windows, then it probably features extra security measures to protect against dangerous attachments that want to do your computer harm, as well as fraudulent links that lead your browser somewhere it shouldn't go.You should also take precautions when using public Wi-Fi, because unsecured networks give hackers more elbow room when it comes to spoofing sites and stealing your information. If you want to be as safe as possible when using the web away from home, we'd recommend sticking to sites that don't deal in sensitive information and installing a VPN package to encrypt any data you do send.Remember standard email security measuresAs we’ve mentioned before, it’s a good idea to regularly check the plug-ins and add-ons connected to your email inbox. This will reveal any third-party programs that have access to your Gmail or Yahoo or Outlook account. This is actually the recommended clean-up method for the phishing attack we referred to at the start of this article — removing the app’s permissions means it will no longer have control of your inbox.The place to find these add-on tools varies depending on your setup. For Gmail, head to your Google account page and click the link labelled Connected apps & sites. After that, select Manage apps and get rid of anything you don’t use regularly or simply don’t recognize. To be clear, many of these add-ons are useful and perfectly safe. But from a security point of view, it’s a good idea to keep the number of these tools to a minimum.Finally, stay informed: Keep an eye on the tech headlines to track the new types of attack that appear on a regular basis. While Google, Microsoft, and other companies usually deal with the latest dangers quite quickly, you’re better off hearing about a dangerous scam before it hits your inbox rather than after."

A study by journalists, for journalists and policymakers: Migration media coverage in 17 countries from 2015 to 2016” is a joint effort of the Ethical Journalism Network, the European Union, Euromed Migration and the International Center for Migration Policy Development.It was presented at a pre-launch event at the Brussels Press Club during which organizers announced the creation of the Migration Media Award.This is a summary of the Lebanon chapter I wrote “Mixed Messages as Media Cope with Internal Stress and External Pressure.”With Lebanese media mired in dysfunctional domestic politics, facing regional security threats and international upheavals, and troubled by their own shaky existence, it’s no surprise there’s been a hodgepodge of migration coverage since 2015.Although glossaries of migrant-related terminology - provided by international organizations and NGOs – exist, journalists covering the story still use terms like “migrant,” “refugee” and “settler” incorrectly and interchangeably. Glossaries are not always updated fast enough to keep up with the media’s needs, and not necessarily available in the three main languages used in Leba­nese news outlets: Arabic, French and English. Statistics are a tricky topic. The government’s fig­ures on the number of Syrian refugees and migrants may vary from those of international organizations and United Nations agencies tasked with registering asylum seekers. A sticking point is the number of undocumented residents who slip undetected across borders, evade aid agency safety nets, and disappear through the cracks of bureaucracy. Lebanon is not a signatory to the 1951 UN conven­tion on “non-refoulement,” or not sending refugees away once they arrive. Sociologist Mona Fayad, in an analysis in Annahar daily on media’s role in dealing with Syrian migration, said Syrian refugees, exceeding a third of the population, threatened Lebanon’s social equilibrium and that the impact had begun to mani­fest itself in the rising rate of violence and security in­cidents involving Syrians who accept aid in exchange for services rendered to partisan groups. Her article also touched on the causes of youth radicalization in migrant and refugee groups and neighboring disadvantaged local communities, and the friction caused by their interaction. “We shouldn’t overlook the fact that the Syrian migration comes against a backdrop of Lebanon un­dergoing a dangerous political, economic, and social crisis tied to domestic problems and the conflict in Syria,” she said, noting that all these factors could undermine security and become a time bomb in the medium and long term. Lebanon, whose population is about four million, hosts upwards of 1.5 million Syrian refugees, and some half a million Palestinians in camps established after the creation of the state of Israel in 1948, to which were added thousands of Iraqis fleeing the violence in their country after the US invasion in 2003. Naharnet, quoting the United Nations, reports that more than half the Syrian refu­gees in Lebanon do not have valid residence permits, leading to a rising number of unregistered newborns. Additionally, many Syrian refugees are hamstrung by measures making it almost impossible for them to obtain or renew their residence permits. As a result children are dropping out of school – if they even attend – and replacing adult men to become their families’ main breadwinners. Lebanon has a turbulent history, including a civil war from 1975 to 1990 during which print and broad­cast media were created to service warring factions, mostly along sectarian and politically ideological lines. They competed with state-run outlets and have morphed into commercial, albeit partisan, ventures. Radio stations and TV channels continue presenting their founders’ views, if not in full militia fashion as during the war, but their bias is inescapable. While examples of fair and balanced coverage of migrant-related issues exist, they seem to have been overshadowed by a proliferation of hate-mongering journalism. Those listed in this report focus on the negative coverage and its ramifications. Shifting political alliances since the Syrian conflict began in 2011 have also meant a certain degree of recurrent escalation or de-escalation in the tone used by some media outlets. There was no reporting in these examples on the diaspora in general, remittances, diaspora invest­ments, and little on migrants’ repatriation, save for Lebanese politicians’ statements about setting up safe havens within Syria for those escaping the vio­lence. Most of the emphasis was on the politics, econom­ics, development/aid and security angles of the story. As with donor fatigue, there is refugee fatigue, so stories involving Syrians reflect the mood. Emotional, human interest and fact-based issues dominate the news agenda when security and terror­ism matters are at stake or when crimes are commit­ted; when Lebanon receives or requests more foreign assistance to handle the flood of Syrians; and when international dignitaries and celebrities visit refugee camps. Major challenges in telling the migration story from inside the newsroom include: • Access to reliable data and statistics. Data come from conflicting sources with an interest at stake, so verification can be problematic; • Political and economic interests that influence me­dia coverage and combine with sectarian, religious, and social considerations; • The presence of hate speech in public discourse, which has become increasingly common. Politicians take to different media platforms to blame their rivals for policy mistakes and social media used by all sides add fuel to the fire by repeating offenses that lead to hate crimes; • The lack of voices for migrants; some media fail to be inclusive because of other priorities, interests, budgets and deadlines. In all of this, social media play an increasingly visible and influential role in coverage of migrants. In some cases it’s positive, like rallying support for needy refugees, but it can also be negative, blaming them for rising crime figures, or for adding to demand for basic services and putting pressure on crumbling infrastructure. This often inflames politicians’ negative statements.A tendency to sensationalize and to use stereotypes has always been present in Lebanese media but this ebbs and flows with the magnitude of crises. In televi­sion, it’s common for newscasts to begin with the head­lines followed by an editorial-cum-opinion introduction passing off as news. That segment is used to lash out at adversaries, criticize policies and practices, defend positions, and draw attention to certain causes, before delving into actual news reports. Online media provide a wider spectrum, given the possibility of posting content 24/7 but social media and comments – where available – are fertile ground for exacerbating matters. Editorial bias is inevitable in a country where media answer to political, economic, religious and sectarian pa­trons and where neighboring Syria, whose government is both villain and hero to different groups of Lebanese citizens, is an inextricable part of Lebanon’s history. During the Lebanese civil war Damascus sent troops under Arab League auspices to help quell the violence. This led to 30 years of heavy-handed tutelage. The troops were chased out following a civil revolt in 2005 after former prime minister Rafic Hariri was as­sassinated, but Syrian influence over internal Lebanese affairs remains strong.

A study by journalists, for journalists and policymakers: Migration media coverage in 17 countries from 2015 to 2016” is a joint effort of the Ethical Journalism Network, the European Union, Euromed Migration and the International Center for Migration Policy Development.It was presented at a pre-launch event at the Brussels Press Club during which organizers announced the creation of the Migration Media Award.This is a summary of the Lebanon chapter I wrote “Mixed Messages as Media Cope with Internal Stress and External Pressure.”With Lebanese media mired in dysfunctional domestic politics, facing regional security threats and international upheavals, and troubled by their own shaky existence, it’s no surprise there’s been a hodgepodge of migration coverage since 2015.Although glossaries of migrant-related terminology - provided by international organizations and NGOs – exist, journalists covering the story still use terms like “migrant,” “refugee” and “settler” incorrectly and interchangeably. Glossaries are not always updated fast enough to keep up with the media’s needs, and not necessarily available in the three main languages used in Leba­nese news outlets: Arabic, French and English. Statistics are a tricky topic. The government’s fig­ures on the number of Syrian refugees and migrants may vary from those of international organizations and United Nations agencies tasked with registering asylum seekers. A sticking point is the number of undocumented residents who slip undetected across borders, evade aid agency safety nets, and disappear through the cracks of bureaucracy. Lebanon is not a signatory to the 1951 UN conven­tion on “non-refoulement,” or not sending refugees away once they arrive. Sociologist Mona Fayad, in an analysis in Annahar daily on media’s role in dealing with Syrian migration, said Syrian refugees, exceeding a third of the population, threatened Lebanon’s social equilibrium and that the impact had begun to mani­fest itself in the rising rate of violence and security in­cidents involving Syrians who accept aid in exchange for services rendered to partisan groups. Her article also touched on the causes of youth radicalization in migrant and refugee groups and neighboring disadvantaged local communities, and the friction caused by their interaction. “We shouldn’t overlook the fact that the Syrian migration comes against a backdrop of Lebanon un­dergoing a dangerous political, economic, and social crisis tied to domestic problems and the conflict in Syria,” she said, noting that all these factors could undermine security and become a time bomb in the medium and long term. Lebanon, whose population is about four million, hosts upwards of 1.5 million Syrian refugees, and some half a million Palestinians in camps established after the creation of the state of Israel in 1948, to which were added thousands of Iraqis fleeing the violence in their country after the US invasion in 2003. Naharnet, quoting the United Nations, reports that more than half the Syrian refu­gees in Lebanon do not have valid residence permits, leading to a rising number of unregistered newborns. Additionally, many Syrian refugees are hamstrung by measures making it almost impossible for them to obtain or renew their residence permits. As a result children are dropping out of school – if they even attend – and replacing adult men to become their families’ main breadwinners. Lebanon has a turbulent history, including a civil war from 1975 to 1990 during which print and broad­cast media were created to service warring factions, mostly along sectarian and politically ideological lines. They competed with state-run outlets and have morphed into commercial, albeit partisan, ventures. Radio stations and TV channels continue presenting their founders’ views, if not in full militia fashion as during the war, but their bias is inescapable. While examples of fair and balanced coverage of migrant-related issues exist, they seem to have been overshadowed by a proliferation of hate-mongering journalism. Those listed in this report focus on the negative coverage and its ramifications. Shifting political alliances since the Syrian conflict began in 2011 have also meant a certain degree of recurrent escalation or de-escalation in the tone used by some media outlets. There was no reporting in these examples on the diaspora in general, remittances, diaspora invest­ments, and little on migrants’ repatriation, save for Lebanese politicians’ statements about setting up safe havens within Syria for those escaping the vio­lence. Most of the emphasis was on the politics, econom­ics, development/aid and security angles of the story. As with donor fatigue, there is refugee fatigue, so stories involving Syrians reflect the mood. Emotional, human interest and fact-based issues dominate the news agenda when security and terror­ism matters are at stake or when crimes are commit­ted; when Lebanon receives or requests more foreign assistance to handle the flood of Syrians; and when international dignitaries and celebrities visit refugee camps. Major challenges in telling the migration story from inside the newsroom include: • Access to reliable data and statistics. Data come from conflicting sources with an interest at stake, so verification can be problematic; • Political and economic interests that influence me­dia coverage and combine with sectarian, religious, and social considerations; • The presence of hate speech in public discourse, which has become increasingly common.

53,POLITICS,Heath Mello Fails To Unseat Republican Mayor In Omaha,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/heath-mello-loses-jean-stothert-omaha_us_59124e8de4b05e1ca202e4aa,The Democrat's anti-abortion record sparked a national controversy.,2017-05-10,Democrat Heath Mello fell short of defeating the Republican mayor of Omaha.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59124a211e00003a00622284.jpeg?cache=F55I57u8L5&ops=crop_6_293_2042_1574%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Republican Jean Stothert on Tuesday was re-elected mayor of Omaha, Nebraska, denying Democrats an opportunity to notch one of their first major wins since President Donald Trump’s election in a state now controlled by Republicans at virtually every level of government.Stothert, 63, Omaha’s first female mayor, defeated Democrat Heath Mello, 37, a charismatic former state senator who attracted attention from Democratic Party national leaders. She took 53 percent of the vote to Mello’s 47 percent.“We will build on the progress achieved by the work of thousands over time ― and lead our city to the great potential that is before us,” Stothert, a former nurse, said in her victory speech Tuesday night.“It is such an exciting time for me to be the leader of the city as your mayor,” she added. “The spirit of participation and cooperation between the city, community groups, businesses and individuals is so positive.”Mello encouraged his supporters to continue to stay active in city politics.“Though the results tonight were not what we all had hoped, I’m incredibly proud and humbled by the movement that all of us here tonight created out of a shared belief that we together could build a better city,” he said.In a fight for control of an increasingly diverse, Democratic-leaning city, Mello tried to take advantage of liberal and moderate voters’ dissatisfaction with Trump. He combined rhetorical broadsides against the president’s hardline immigration policies, opposition to climate change action and proposed budget cuts with a relentless focus on bread-and-butter local issues like potholes and crime.In the end, neither national politics nor the status quo in Omaha were enough to turn out the Democrats and independent voters Mello needed to win.“The tide that exists here is that people are really satisfied with the direction Omaha is going in,” Dave Boomer, a Stothert campaign spokesman, told HuffPost earlier Tuesday.Initially, the national party saw in Mello’s candidacy an opportunity to flex its muscles in a conservative state. The Democratic National Committee made a contribution to the Nebraska Democratic Party to help elect Mello, and as part of its “national unity” tour in April held a rally for him at which Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) spoke.The DNC’s elevation of Mello backfired, however, when it emerged that he was not only anti-abortion personally, but also had a history of supporting abortion restrictions as a state senator. NARAL Pro-Choice America and other reproductive rights groups publicly lashed out at DNC chair Tom Perez for including an abortion rights foe on its national tour, and Daily Kos quickly withdrew its endorsement of Mello.Mello responded immediately by promising to “never do anything to restrict access to reproductive health care,” and campaigned on protecting Planned Parenthood funding in the event of federal cuts.Still, the incident made Mello the focus of a bitter national debate about how welcoming the Democratic Party should be toward abortion opponents, complicating what would have otherwise been a prime opportunity for him to capitalize on national attention and resources.“That hurt him. The pro-life groups got engaged and were doing mailings to their members calling into question his commitment to being pro-life,” Boomer, the Stothert campaign spokesman, said. “He did that to himself. We didn’t really have to do too much on that.”In other ways, Stothert proved a difficult foil in the attempt to nationalize the race. Although she is a Republican, she did not vote for Trump.Mello had also hoped his record as a champion of immigration rights would bolster turnout for him in Omaha’s growing Latino community. Mello’s legislative district included parts of South Omaha, where the Latino community is most concentrated.Key figures in the immigrant rights community credit Mello for leading the fight as state senator to overturn the Nebraska governor’s veto of two bills expanding the rights of undocumented immigrants who have earned special dispensation from the federal government since they arrived as children. One law permitted the state to issue driver’s licenses to these Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival recipients, while a second legally sanctioned professional licenses for them.But here, too, Mello had challenges drawing a contrast with Stothert. Stothert sent letters in support of the two pieces of legislation Mello championed. And as part of her courtship of the city’s Latino’s voters, she set up a satellite campaign office in South Omaha and distributed Spanish-language campaign material.Stothert’s victory is in this way, albeit indirectly, a win for the Latino community of Omaha, whose activism propelled Mello to become a champion of immigrant rights in the Nebraska legislature ― and subsequently prompted Stothert to support the legislation protecting undocumented immigrants that Mello had championed.“She realized the importance to have the Latino vote to win the election,” Sergio Sosa, executive director of the Heartland Workers Center, a Latino workers rights group that registers voters, told HuffPost last week. (Sosa does not endorse candidates due to HWC’s nonprofit status.)And Mello’s case against the city’s performance under Stothert was likely not an easy sell.Notwithstanding its deep racial segregation and inequality, Omaha is, broadly speaking, not a city that is struggling economically. The city is home to major corporations like Mutual of Omaha, TD Ameritrade, Union Pacific Railroad and of course, Berkshire Hathaway, the massive investment fund founded by billionaire Warren Buffett. The city’s unemployment rate was 3.2 percent in March.Mello was deeply critical of Stothert’s handling of the city’s pothole problem and attacked her for expanding the city limits westward without commensurate increases in police resources.The case was rarely clear-cut, however. Under Stothert, police response times on less urgent matters were longer, for example, but response times on the most pressing category of calls were down.An advertisement Mello aired in which an Omaha paramedic complained that police response times were preventing him and his colleagues from doing their jobs drew the veiled condemnation of the city’s popular police commissioner Todd Schmaderer.Schmaderer was formally neutral in the race. The paramedic featured in the ad is a member of the local firefighters’ union, which endorsed Mello."
54,POLITICS,3 Republicans Defect To Reject Bill To Repeal Obama-Era Greenhouse Gas Rule,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/methane-cra-vote_us_5913289ae4b050bdca615e5d,But the Interior Department says it will scrap the regulation anyway.,2017-05-10,"A gas flare is seen at an oil well site outside Williston, North Dakota, on July 26, 2013. Gas flares are created when excess flammable gases are released by pressure release valves during the drilling for oil and natural gas.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59133e1f1700001f005a5d7d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Republicans’ bid to roll back an Obama-era rule limiting methane emissions from drilling rigs on public lands narrowly lost in the Senate on Wednesday after three GOP senators voted against the repeal.In a 49-51 vote, the Senate preserved the rule, strengthened after last November’s election, that limited the amount of the powerful greenhouse gas methane that can be vented and burned from oil and gas extraction sites on federal lands.Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) were expected to vote against the rule, but the surprise defection of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) helped tilt the scales on a vote environmentalists are hailing as a rare victory over President Donald Trump’s assault on policies that address climate change.“Improving the control of methane emissions is an important public health and air quality issue, which is why some states are moving forward with their own regulations requiring greater investment in recapture technology,” McCain said in a statement. “While I am concerned that the BLM rule may be onerous, passage of the resolution would have prevented the federal government, under any administration, from issuing a rule that is ‘similar,’ according to the plain reading of the Congressional Review Act.” Under the 1996 Congressional Review Act, Congress can undo any regulation within 60 days of its finalization and bar agencies from writing a “substantially” similar rule after the initial rule has been blocked. Using that law, GOP lawmakers hoped to dismantle a rule announced last November by the Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management that cracked down on the amount of methane gas producers could release. Congress had until the end of the week to use the CRA.Following the vote, which came three months after the House passed similar legislation, the Interior Department said it would move to modify or eliminate the rule anyway. “As part of President Trump’s America-First Energy Strategy and executive order, the Department has reviewed and flagged the Waste Prevention rule as one we will suspend, revise or rescind given its significant regulatory burden that encumbers American energy production, economic growth and job creation,” the agency said in a statement soon after the vote. “The rule is expected to have real and harmful impacts on onshore energy development and could impact state and local jobs and revenue.”The rule doesn’t do much to reduce emissions from the natural gas industry. Just 11 percent of the country’s natural gas supply and 5 percent of its oil is drilled from public lands, according to Interior Department data cited by Axios. And environmental advocates have spent the last four months in back-footed opposition to the Trump administration’s moves aimed at undoing regulations to address global warming. Trump delayed his announcement this week on whether he will withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, the historic climate deal signed by all but two countries, but sources told HuffPost last week he is leaning toward exiting the accord. In March, Trump ordered his Environmental Protection Agency, led by brazen oil and gas industry ally Scott Pruitt, to review the Clean Power Plan, the United States’ foremost policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. As one of his first moves in office, Pruitt scrapped a regulation requiring oil and gas drillers to report methane emissionsStill, the Senate vote on Wednesday marks a symbolic victory for environmentalists. “Today’s victory against Trump’s plan to hand our public lands to Big Oil is a win for the American people,” Lukas Ross, climate and energy campaigner at the nonprofit Friends of the Earth, said in a statement. “Today the Senate proved it will not always rob taxpayers to line Big Oil’s pockets.”“Today’s vote means that an important solution to reducing venting, flaring and leaking of methane and other hazardous pollutants will likely be upheld, which will help protect the health of our families,” Harold Wimmer, CEO of the American Lung Association, said in a statement. “Reducing methane emissions is essential to combating climate change, which is already harming Americans’ health.”Still, the oil and gas companies and their allies argue that the rule puts an unnecessary burden on an industry that is already striving to waste less methane. “Methane emissions from our sector continue to fall, even as natural gas production nationwide has soared, making this redundant and technically flawed rule a solution in search of a problem,” Jack Gerard, president of the American Petroleum Institute, wrote in a letter to Senate leadership on Tuesday.Another industry-backed group, the Western Energy Alliance, said it plans to continue to push a lawsuit filed in November, arguing that the BLM lacks the authority to enforce the rule. This article has been updated with more details on and reactions to the vote."
55,ENTERTAINMENT,Steve Bannon's Failed 'Star Wars'-Meets-Shakespeare Movie Script,Todd Van Luling,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/steve-bannon-star-wars-shakespeare_us_59077cabe4b02655f83f1361,"""The game is death.""",2017-05-10,The NowThis reading of Bannon and Jones' rap musical.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591096fd17000020005a55f1.png?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"It sounded kind of smart, at least in the beginning.“Basically, what we were doing was a cross between Shakespeare and ‘Star Wars.’” Steve Bannon’s former screenwriting partner, Julia Jones, told HuffPost. “Unfortunately, it wasn’t a good script, but it was a great idea,” Jones said, of the “Titus Andronicus”-inspired script she worked on with Bannon. “The Andronicii were light beings. They were transparent and they only took human form when they entered the Earth plane. So it had a lot of sort of esoteric ideas.”Jones, whose political views are liberal, worked with Bannon off and on for over a dozen years. In Jones’ recollection, Bannon was a Republican, but not the far-right conservative he has become today — at least at the beginning of their relationship.“Before 9/11, it seemed [the politics] wasn’t an issue,” said Jones. “He was a Republican and then I was a Democrat, and back in those days, you know, that happened.”As she explained to HuffPost, Jones has been talking to press outlets since Steve Bannon’s rise in the Donald Trump administration to make sense of his apparent transformation into a politcal power player who says things like, “Dick Cheney. Darth Vader. Satan. That’s power.”Jones recently approved a live-reading of the duo’s rap musical about the Los Angeles riots of 1992, which was read to humorous effect by actors and comedians such as Rob Corddry for NowThis. That play wasn’t exactly a harbinger for Bannon’s brand of conservatism, but was definitely ridiculous.“You cry against the ‘other’ — crackers, Blood, Crip, popo, Pol, the rich — it don’t matter, n***as; awe keeps you feeding each another,” is just one memorable line. Jones, who now looks back on her earlier writing with the humor of more experience, loved how the live-reading turned out.As The New Yorker recently detailed in length, Bannon started his attempt at a career in Hollywood as a financier, initially as part of Goldman Sachs. When he decided he wanted to become a screenwriter, he hired Jones after a chance encounter at a busy restaurant in 1991.“I was kind of trying to get out of the conversation, actually,” Jones said, sort of jokingly. She was trying to return to her own party. But the conversation of what they both did professionally came up, and Jones said she was working on a screenplay relating to the works of Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe.“It sort of didn’t work. His response was, ‘I’m looking for a Shakespearean screenwriter.’ So how often does that happen?” she said.The two set out to develop the “Star Wars”-meets-Shakespeare idea of adapting “Titus Andronicus” into space. Jones suggested putting pyramids on a planet, an idea that Bannon liked, and which eventually made it into the script.Jones gave HuffPost the script with the caveat: “Just be advised, it’s probably laughable in parts.”The original play, in which Roman general Titus returns from war and engages in a cycle of revenge with Tamora, Queen of the Goths, is considered Shakespeare’s most violent work. In Bannon and Jones’ script, the general vibe of extreme darkness is certainly kept. The script is also highly ambitious in calling for alien battle scenes that even James Cameron probably would have struggled to depict.To get a sense of the plot, this is the opening “mechanical voice” narration:Long ago when aliens ravaged ancient Earth, the people fled underground, hiding out in caves to escape death and slavery at the hands of the invaders. In this adaptation, Titus is a “Star Warrior” who is “half-human, half-light.” Missiles point earthward from Mars. The Lincoln monument in Washington D.C. has already been “blackened.” Early on, a hologram game is played that depicts an atom bomb exploding. As a character observes this, another remarks to dramatic effect, “Ah, your holiness ... do join us. The game is death.”Later, a child asks, “What is human kind?” The response is sarcastic chuckling as a character sardonically states, “A contradiction in terms.”When asked whether she and Bannon thought about the feasibility of making this movie, Jones chuckled and admitted, “I don’t think we thought very realistically at all while we were writing it.”In a story about this fabled script published in The Paris Review last November, the publication brought to attention an other-worldly sex scene that is hard to imagine could have been filmed at the time. The relevant line in the script: “He climbs onto her and their forms dissolve, blend and blur in an erotic scene of ectoplasmic sex.”“We just thought it was brilliant,” said Jones of their script as a whole. “I think we just assumed the studio would take care of all of that.”As with the results of his other partnerships with Jones, this Bannon script never became a movie. Bannon did kind of, sort of, eventually succeed in getting a “Titus Andronicus” adaptation made years later, though, as he executive produced the 1999 film “Titus.” Anthony Hopkins starred in the titular role.Over the years, Bannon began to pivot into making explicitly political documentaries, which led to his rise within the far-right community. Jones had a writing credit on the 2004, “In the Face of Evil: Reagan’s War in Word and Deed,” but wanted to make it clear she had no input on that film, except essentially acting as Bannon’s typist. As The Washington Post described the documentary, “That film included a coda that warned about the threat of ‘the beast’ during a montage that showed praying Muslims, terrorist camps and people falling to their deaths from the World Trade Center on 9/11.”Jones and Bannon then parted ways professionally.“He loves being the bad guy,” Jones explained of Bannon’s personality and his ultimate decision to publicly embrace his controversial politics. “He loves it. The more bad things people say about him, the more he likes it.”Following the Shakespearean source material, Bannon’s Titus gets killed near the end of his script. The titular character’s dramatic last words in the adaptation are, “Elio, Elio, caraba! Elio mea! Lemnith, lemna meo Elio caraba ...”His words are the nonsense language of Titus’ space race, with which Jones and Bannon never ascribed any definitive meaning.“I made up those words,” Jones explained over a follow-up email. “No translation. I’m sure [it] meant Unity. It was like Latin but made-up.” "

The game is death.”Later, a child asks, “What is human kind?” The response is sarcastic chuckling as a character sardonically states, “A contradiction in terms.”When asked whether she and Bannon thought about the feasibility of making this movie, Jones chuckled and admitted, “I don’t think we thought very realistically at all while we were writing it.”In a story about this fabled script published in The Paris Review last November, the publication brought to attention an other-worldly sex scene that is hard to imagine could have been filmed at the time. The relevant line in the script: “He climbs onto her and their forms dissolve, blend and blur in an erotic scene of ectoplasmic sex.”“We just thought it was brilliant,” said Jones of their script as a whole. “I think we just assumed the studio would take care of all of that.”As with the results of his other partnerships with Jones, this Bannon script never became a movie. Bannon did kind of, sort of, eventually succeed in getting a “Titus Andronicus” adaptation made years later, though, as he executive produced the 1999 film “Titus.” Anthony Hopkins starred in the titular role.Over the years, Bannon began to pivot into making explicitly political documentaries, which led to his rise within the far-right community. Jones had a writing credit on the 2004, “In the Face of Evil: Reagan’s War in Word and Deed,” but wanted to make it clear she had no input on that film, except essentially acting as Bannon’s typist. As The Washington Post described the documentary, “That film included a coda that warned about the threat of ‘the beast’ during a montage that showed praying Muslims, terrorist camps and people falling to their deaths from the World Trade Center on 9/11.”Jones and Bannon then parted ways professionally.“He loves being the bad guy,” Jones explained of Bannon’s personality and his ultimate decision to publicly embrace his controversial politics. “He loves it. The more bad things people say about him, the more he likes it.”Following the Shakespearean source material, Bannon’s Titus gets killed near the end of his script. The titular character’s dramatic last words in the adaptation are, “Elio, Elio, caraba! Elio mea! Lemnith, lemna meo Elio caraba ...”His words are the nonsense language of Titus’ space race, with which Jones and Bannon never ascribed any definitive meaning.“I made up those words,” Jones explained over a follow-up email. “No translation. I’m sure [it] meant Unity. It was like Latin but made-up.” "

It’s very serious and it’s a crisis.”",2017-05-10,Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez speaks Wednesday as people rally outside the White House to protest against President Donald Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59135aea1e00003a00622550.jpeg?cache=hx3vxBMjXJ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Less than 24 hours after President Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, hundreds of people gathered outside the gates of the White House to demand the appointment of an independent prosecutor to investigate alleged ties between Trump and Russia.Speaking among chants of “wake up and smell the cover-up,” Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez said Democrats should refuse to confirm a new FBI head until the Department of Justice commits to a special prosecutor.“You know you’re in trouble when the Nixon Library is tweeting in an effort to distance themselves from this president,” Perez said. “This is actually worse than the Saturday Night Massacre. Richard Nixon fired a prosecutor, he should not have done that. Donald Trump fired the investigator in that case. That has never been done.”Trump fired Comey on Tuesday as he was investigating allegations of connections between the Trump campaign and Russia. Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, had recommended Comey’s dismissal because of the way he handled an investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server. Trump said Wednesday that he fired Comey because he “was not doing a good job.”Standing beneath a neon sign that said “I call bullshit,” Judi Casey said she wasn’t a fan of Comey, but didn’t think he should have been fired.“I sat watching CNN all day yesterday. And I’m horrified by Trump’s chutzpah, I don’t know how else to say it, basically to destroy democracy and basically fire the investigator that’s investigating him,” she told HuffPost. “You can’t do that. Trump is using this as intimidation and you’re going to lose your job if you go against him.”Megan Sinesiou, from Falls Church, Virginia, said she came to the protest to show Trump that his meeting with Sergey Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, was unacceptable.“People are scared, rightfully. He’s the one in charge of overseeing the investigation and the Trump-Russia ties, I believe in the Trump-Russia connection. It’s not OK that he’s meeting with Lavrov inside. It’s not OK that Lavrov mocked this this morning, so that’s why I’m here,” she said in an interview as demonstrators nearby chanted “lock him up.” During campaign rallies, there were often chants of “lock her up” as Trump suggested Clinton’s use of a private email server was criminal.Elizabeth Lane, an anti-trust lawyer, said she has been coming to the White House once or twice each week since the election. She worries that if the Department of Justice did appoint an independent investigator, it could be a Trump ally like New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) or Rudy Giuliani, which would be “even more outrageous.”“I feel like he’s pushing the envelope and trying to see what he can get away with. As a reality show star, that’s his M.O. to try and create excitement and chaos. It’s not entertaining to me and it’s not funny. It’s very serious and it’s a crisis.”"

We have a House investigation by our Intelligence Committee, which is the appropriate committee to do that, I believe. And we have a Senate Intelligence Committee ― you just played [Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman] Richard Burr ― doing an investigation. And you have the FBI investigating all things Russia.”Burr, who is leading the Senate investigation, said Tuesday night that he was “troubled” by the timing and reasoning of Comey’s firing and that the dismissal “further confuses an already difficult investigation by our committee.”The House investigation has been hampered by constant controversy, culminating in House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) recusing himself from the matter because of his contact with Trump officials.Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) has repeatedly called for an independent investigation into Russian meddling with the U.S. presidential election, and other Republicans were coming out Tuesday and Wednesday in support of that idea.But not Ryan. He argued, rather bizarrely, that the United States needed to be protective of its intelligence gathering secrets, as if a special investigation couldn’t protect classified material.“Don’t forget that the methods and sources of intelligence gathering are also at play here,” Ryan said, “and we have to be very sensitive that we don’t compromise that information as well.”The speaker spent Wednesday touring a factory in Ohio and ignoring questions all day about the Comey matter, with his office referring reporters to his 6 p.m. Fox News interview.That now seems like a tactic executed to downplay the news of Comey’s dismissal and sidestep the questions raised by a president’s sudden firing of his FBI director after he came forward to ask for more resources to investigate the Russian ties.But Ryan doesn’t seem bothered by any of it. “The president made a presidential decision and removed him,” Ryan said."

Students noted that DeVos’ ahistorical description of HBCUs as an example of “school choice” in February was problematic and a reflection of her lack of understanding of black colleges and the issues they face.On Tuesday, protesters delivered more than 50,000 signatures ― collected through Change.org, Color of Change and Florida Education Association ― to the school’s leaders, pressuring them to rescind DeVos’ invitation, according to The Washington Post. Alumnus Dominik Whitehead, who started a Change.org petition, told WaPo that though he doesn’t see anything wrong with DeVos going to speak on campus in general, she is the wrong person to give the commencement speech.“Do not use Bethune-Cookman as a photo op,” he said. “Come to the table with something that is going to actually do something in terms of policy, funding.”Whitehead’s petition points to DeVos’ lack of “understanding of the importance, contributions, and significance of HBCUs” and her weakening consumer protection for student loan borrowers as reasons why it would be an “insult” having her speak at graduation.Taylor Durrant, a graduating senior who signed the petition, told NewsOne that someone who “embodies the characteristics of the university” should be delivering the commencement speech. “DeVos will give a monologue. She’s a controversial political figure who will overshadow the graduating class and push an agenda,” Durrant said. “I want someone who works in the community and can relate to me. She doesn’t know anything about HBCUs. I want someone who will inspire me to serve the community. Now I’m sitting in anxiety and confusion.”In addition to students and alumni, the NAACP Florida State Conference also stepped into the fight against DeVos, calling on the secretary to decline the invitation to speak. Adora Obi Nweze, the group’s president, said in a statement that if DeVos speaks and is awarded with an honorary degree, it would be insulting to women and people of color, according to WaPo. The organization is also calling for the resignation of University President Edison Jackson and Board Chairman Joe Petrock, claiming that there are “multiple allegations” that the university is intimidating faculty and staff by threatening them with termination, degree withholding or fines if they protest. Jackson sent a letter to the B-CU community stating that the opposition to the school’s decision is healthy.“I am of the belief that it does not benefit our students to suppress voices that we disagree with, or to limit students to only those perspectives that are broadly sanctioned by a specific community,” he wrote. “If our students are robbed of the opportunity to experience and interact with views that may be different from their own, then they will be tremendously less equipped for the demands of democratic citizenship.”DeVos is “looking forward” to speaking at the HBCU’s graduation and wants to engage in “productive dialogue with the students, faculty and staff during her visit,” a Department of Education spokeswoman told WaPo.The morning of commencement day, protests have already begun. Journalists Jackie Orozco and Adam Harris shared photos and videos outside of The Ocean Center, where the graduation is taking place:Protests are expected to continue during Wednesday’s ceremony."

The group is featured in a video posted Monday by Miami-based Venezuelan journalist Alberto Rodríguez on Twitter. The video, which identifies the athletes by name and team, currently has over 11,500 retweets.“My name is Francisco Cervelli, we’re a group of Venezuelan players in Major League Baseball,” the catcher for the Pittsburgh Pirates says at the beginning of the video in Spanish. “We’re speaking not as players but as citizens, as people who love their country.”Thousands of protesters in Venezuela have taken to the streets for more than a month in opposition of Nicolás Maduro’s government, asking the president to step down and holding signs that say “No more dictatorship.” The political unrest in the South American country has resulted in at least 37 people being killed since early April, according to Reuters. Hundreds have been injured and arrested as well. For years, citizens in Venezuela have suffered from a shortage of basic food items and medicine under Maduro. In addition, the country’s economy has severely deteriorated. Cervelli was joined in the minute-long video by other MLB players, including Jose Osuna, Elías Díaz and Felipe Rivero from the Pittsburgh Pirates; Orlando Arcia, Jesús Aguilar and Hernán Pérez from the Milwaukee Brewers; Ender Inciarte from the Atlanta Braves; Eugenio Suárez and José Peraza from the Cincinnati Reds; Alcides Escobar and Salvador Pérez from the Kansas City Royals; and Gorkys Hernández from the San Francisco Giants. Each of the athletes takes turns sending a message in opposition of Maduro and his government. “Stop the repression; they’re killing us, they’re taking away our future,” Inciarte says in the video in Spanish.

Now a new law gives the police more power and responsibility to combat the problem, and bring perpetrators to justice.ULAANBAATAR, MONGOLIA – In the sparsely populated steppe of Mongolia, where there are not always governing authorities to maintain law and order, nomadic families take care of their own affairs, and have done so for centuries. For some women and children, that means living with abusive husbands and fathers.That was Amar’s life, before she finally mustered the courage to escape a hellish relationship filled with regular beatings and psychological abuse.“It was torture,” Amar says, as she tugs a pearl ring back and forth on her finger. “He hit me until my face was flattened.” He would sometimes rape her at night, she adds.Sometimes she’d have her children stay with family members so they would not have to witness the abuse.“We’d sometimes bring our children to his sister’s, and when [he and I] got home, he’d tie me up in a chair and beat me,” she says.It’s now been five years since Amar left home in the dead of night dressed only in her pajamas with her children. By then, she had put up with the abuse for three-quarters of her 27-year marriage.She first went to a friend’s house, but has been constantly on the move since to avoid her husband finding her. She spent time in a domestic violence shelter and once lived at a construction site.“Ever since, I’ve lived like a stray, going from place to place,” she says. One of her children is still with her; the others have grown up and left.When Amar first told her parents and in-laws about the attacks, she said they had a hard time believing it and even suggested that the punishments were because she was failing as a housewife. “Now people blame me for marrying a bad man,” she says with tears in her eyes. And she can’t help but place some of that guilt on herself. “All in all, it was my bad luck for marrying a bad man.”The U.N. estimates that one in five Mongolian women is subject to domestic abuse, but in the past, women’s advocates say, the police have been reluctant to get involved. When they did, there was nothing to stop the men from returning home and offending again.But law enforcement in Mongolia is now better prepared to take on cases of domestic violence. A new law that took effect last year has made protecting people from their relatives part of a police officer’s job, and the police are now held accountable for ignoring complaints.A police officer, who asked not to be named, says responding to domestic violence against women and children is a chief focus of changes within the police force, and that a special unit had been established for responding to domestic abuse.“We rallied for change in the criminal code,” says Tsedevdamba Oyungerel, a former M.P. who made the law a cornerstone of her career.In the past, abusers were given light penalties and were quickly out of prison after being sentenced. “There was a circle of violence to break,” Oyungerel says.This isn’t the first time Mongolia has tried to tackle domestic abuse. Nordogjav Ariuntaria, a lawyer and a coordinator for legal reform at the National Center Against Violence (NCAV) in Mongolia, says a 2004 law that criminalized domestic violence didn’t have the teeth to punish offenders, nor to protect victims.As a result, since 2010, over 100 people have been murdered and about 4,000 injuries inflicted as a result of domestic abuse, according to documents shown to News Deeply by NCAV. And those are just the cases that were reported.“The police weren’t on board,” says Ariuntaria of the 2004 law. “It’s still a problem now, but things are better than before.”NCAV says it has assisted 19,000 people – mostly women and children – since the organization was established in 1995. It runs three domestic violence shelters and provides counseling and legal support for women and children escaping abuse at home.Ariuntaria says the new law is definitely an improvement, but the group and others think it can still be better. “There’s still work to be done,” says Oyungerel. “There’s still not a strong enough mechanism to protect women.”Oyungerel and Ariuntaria say parliament has not yet voted on provisions that would enforce restraining orders and give some lenience for women who kill their spouses in self-defense. There are currently 36 women currently in prison for killing their spouses, and the NCAV believes they are facing unjust sentences. Around a quarter of the provinces outside the capital still don’t have any shelters for women and children.Amar says the new law doesn’t do enough to help traumatized victims who have already lost everything. “I’ve spent half of my life running away,” she says, adding that she’s still on the run from her husband. “Now I’m 53 and retirement is coming, but I have no support, except medical insurance.”“What about my youth and home?” she asks. “There’s still no support for women who start over.”This article originally appeared on Women & Girls Hub.

63,POLITICS,Russian Foreign Minister And Trump Agree: No Need To Probe Election Meddling,Akbar Shahid Ahmed,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/russia-foreign-minister-trump-election-interference_us_591330f7e4b05e1ca203ca11,President Donald Trump met with Sergey Lavrov and the Russian ambassador just a day after firing James Comey.,2017-05-10,"President Donald Trump and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov (second from left) meet for talks in the Oval Office, along with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak (fourth from right).",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59133dc61e00002800622482.jpeg?cache=F0jxuqY7mf&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Wednesday criticized the ongoing investigation into alleged Russian involvement in the 2016 U.S. election and noted that President Donald Trump appears to share Moscow’s view.“Russia is not involved in your domestic politics,” Lavrov said in a morning briefing at the Russian Embassy. “President Trump publicly says that all of it is false news. ... Everyone keeps saying that everyone knows everything but giving no proof. Well, it’s not serious.”Trump has repeatedly cast doubt on the U.S. intelligence community’s assessment that the Russian government directed a campaign of hacking last year to benefit his candidacy. On Tuesday night, he fired FBI Director James Comey, whose agency has been investigating apparent Russian contacts with the Trump presidential campaign since last July.The president publicly cited Comey’s handling of a probe into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s email use as the reason for the firing, but press reports suggest that his anger over the continuing Russia investigation was Trump’s true motivation. The New York Times has since reported that Comey requested more resources for the Russia work just last week. Republican leaders, including some who occasionally break from party ranks like Sens. Susan Collins (Maine) and Rand Paul (Ky.), and conservative media have rallied behind Trump, rejecting claims that a special independent prosecutor is necessary.Lavrov’s press conference capped a busy day for the Russian emissary. First, he went to the State Department to meet with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. There, he deflected a question about Comey’s dismissal. “Was he fired? You are kidding. You are kidding,” Lavrov said to a reporter who’d raised the matter.Next the minister headed to the White House, accompanied by Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, the man who had controversial undisclosed contacts last year with Trump aides Michael Flynn, Jared Kushner and Jeff Sessions. The Russian Embassy released a photo of Trump shaking hands with Kislyak ― adding another eyebrow-raising image to a day of strange optics.After meeting with the Russians, Trump was also photographed with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, just as much of official Washington was comparing Trump’s actions to those of Kissinger’s onetime boss, President Richard Nixon.A White House statement said that Trump’s meeting with the Russians covered Syria and Ukraine, and that the president emphasized his desire to improve U.S.-Russia relations. Unusually, Trump’s team did not allow U.S. media to briefly enter the meeting, mirroring Russian practice.At his press conference, Lavrov said he anticipates U.S.-Russian coordination on issues ranging from Afghanistan to Syria and believes that agreements are possible despite months of rocky relations. He rejected U.S. military claims that Moscow is supplying the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan and called Trump a pragmatic businessman.Back in Russia, President Vladimir Putin told CBS News that Trump was “acting in accordance with his law.”There are currently four U.S. government investigations into the Russian role in the election. One is being conducted by the FBI, and three are taking place on Capitol Hill ― one each by the House and Senate Intelligence Committees and another by a subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee.UPDATE: May 11 ― Lavrov’s White House visit became even more controversial later on Wednesday, after former national security officials warned that the Trump team made a risky error by permitting Russian media equipment into the Oval Office. (A Russian photographer was allowed in, even though U.S. journalists were not.) An administration official told The Washington Post that they did not realize the photographer worked for the Russian state media, believing that he was the minister’s personal photographer, and were not aware he would publicly release the photographs of Trump with Lavrov and Kislyak. “They tricked us,” an official told CNN. “They lie.”"

Perhaps it’s a sign of the times that he just decided to go for it, at the tail end of an intimate iHeartRadio Album Release Party at Rough Trade NYC ahead of his self-titled album’s Friday debut.After the dive, it took Styles several minutes to emerge from the circle of fans that surrounded him to climb back over the barrier and onstage, leaving in his wake an epic story to be detailed and rehashed on Twitter, adding to the overwhelming narrative surrounding the musician days before his first solo release: Harry Styles is as big as ever, and he still knows how to surprise us — even when doing so means knocking into fans with his boots during that impromptu leap off the stage.Some have been waiting to hear what Styles could do solo since his turn as a 16-year-old contestant on the British “X Factor” in 2010, where he met the four other young singers who would join him on a sky-high ascension as the boy band One Direction. “Sign of the Times,” the first single from Styles’ self-titled album, was a sweeping, decidedly un-boy-bandy statement on how he sounds when it’s just him.A caveat that feels necessary: To praise Styles’ new sound is not to disparage his former group’s.

65,ENTERTAINMENT,It's Only Just Beginning (Again) For Harry Styles,Jillian Capewell,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-enduring-appeal-of-harry-styles_us_5911c218e4b0e7021e9b330e,"With his first solo effort, out Friday, the former One Direction member tackles a brand new sound.",2017-05-10,Harry Styles performs onstage at an iHeartRadio release party Monday in New York.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591239a11e00002800622222.jpeg?cache=H2uOp0NDXi&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Harry Styles has always wanted to stage-dive into a crowd. Perhaps it’s a sign of the times that he just decided to go for it, at the tail end of an intimate iHeartRadio Album Release Party at Rough Trade NYC ahead of his self-titled album’s Friday debut.After the dive, it took Styles several minutes to emerge from the circle of fans that surrounded him to climb back over the barrier and onstage, leaving in his wake an epic story to be detailed and rehashed on Twitter, adding to the overwhelming narrative surrounding the musician days before his first solo release: Harry Styles is as big as ever, and he still knows how to surprise us — even when doing so means knocking into fans with his boots during that impromptu leap off the stage.Some have been waiting to hear what Styles could do solo since his turn as a 16-year-old contestant on the British “X Factor” in 2010, where he met the four other young singers who would join him on a sky-high ascension as the boy band One Direction. “Sign of the Times,” the first single from Styles’ self-titled album, was a sweeping, decidedly un-boy-bandy statement on how he sounds when it’s just him.A caveat that feels necessary: To praise Styles’ new sound is not to disparage his former group’s. Both this new guitar-heavy, occasionally Bowie-esque pop rock and the more danceable bubble-gum tunes that preceded it are worthy in their own right.

Ultimately, she received just under 34 percent of the vote, a landslide loss that fell short of her National Front party’s expectations and saw French voters from many different demographics rallying to oppose her.Still, Le Pen’s movement is unlikely to fade from France’s political scene any time soon. The National Front has been embedded in French politics for decades, and over the long term, support for Europe’s far-right populists has been growing amid the collapse of traditional party systems. Le Pen’s election result, though worse than polls predicted, is still the best that France’s far right has ever performed.Le Pen faces a sizable challenge, however, in figuring out how to change French perceptions of her and the National Front if she wants to reach a wider range of voters. She could also face internal challenges to her leadership if the National Front crashes out of parliamentary elections next month.Although Le Pen spent years attempting to normalize the National Front, many voters still viewed her and the party in an extremely negative light. The most common reason given for voting Macron was to stop Le Pen, according to an Ipsos poll released after the election.In her concession speech on Sunday, Le Pen acknowledged that the National Front would need to undergo a “deep transformation.” Party Vice President Florian Philippot told reporters that this could include renaming the party entirely. But analysts say a name change may not be enough to shift public perception of the party, as long as it adheres to Islamophobic and nativist views.“The reason that the party brand is still toxic is because her discourse still is,” said Rainbow Murray, an associate professor at Queen Mary University of London. “I don’t think a new name is going to change what the party is.”If Le Pen does want to reform the party, she would have to do so quickly, as critical parliamentary elections are approaching next month. The National Front has only two out of 577 seats in France’s Parliament and is looking to make enough gains to become a major opposition party.Failure to capitalize on the new surge of support for the party could hurt Le Pen internally, leading to increased criticism of her leadership after she botched some aspects of her presidential campaign ― including a key debate days before the vote.But Le Pen still commands power within the National Front and has steered the party to unprecedented levels of popularity, establishing a strong base among younger voters. “The Le Pen dynasty doesn’t fall easily,” Murray said, noting that Jean-Marie Le Pen, Marine’s father, faced a similar internal party uprising in the late 1990s that he managed to quell.Le Pen also benefits from the reality that there are no obvious alternatives to take over leadership of the National Front. One possible successor was party MP Marion Maréchal-Le Pen ― the 27-year-old niece of Marine ― but on Tuesday, the younger Le Pen announced that she was stepping away from political life and would not seek re-election.Marion Maréchal-Le Pen was one of the National Front’s highest-profile figures throughout the campaign, and attracted heavy media coverage after becoming France’s youngest ever member of Parliament in 2012. She represents a more conservative faction of the party, and during the campaign she took a more hard-line stance than her aunt on same-sex marriage and other issues.Other leaders of the National Front have struggled to gain prominence or survive scrutiny. After Le Pen temporarily stepped down as party head before the election’s final round, freshly appointed leader Jean-François Jalkh lasted only a few days before he was forced to step down over statements denying the Holocaust."

As Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) shot down calls for a special prosecutor to lead the ongoing investigation into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election and possible ties to President Donald Trump, a number of his rank-and-file members struggled to understand Trump’s actions. Some feared the president went too far in firing Comey, and that the timing looked suspicious. Others started to soften to the idea of a special prosecutor. “I think the White House ― after multiple conversations after the last 12 to 14 hours ― understand that they’ve created a really difficult situation for themselves to move beyond this in a way that gives the American people faith and Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate faith,” Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) told reporters on Wednesday.The road ahead for the White House looks “tough and narrow,” he added. “They’re fully aware now that this has created quite a situation for them to deal with,” Corker said, adding that “we’ll see” if a special prosecutor is necessary. Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) questioned the timing and circumstances of Trump’s decision to fire Comey, which the White House claims was initiated by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. “I believe the White House should provide a fuller explanation regarding the president’s rationale,” Portman said in a statement. “I’m concerned about eroding trust in this premier law enforcement agency.”Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), who is overseeing an investigation into Russian interference in the election as chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Comey’s firing “creates challenges” for his panel. “The timing of this and the reasoning for it doesn’t make sense to me,” Burr said Wednesday. “I think this made our task more difficult, but it didn’t make it impossible so we will continue.”Comey was scheduled to speak before the Senate Intel panel on Thursday. Burr later announced that acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe will testify before the committee in place of Comey. Later on Wednesday, Burr and Vice Chairman Mark Warner (D-Va.) invited Comey to meet in a closed session next week, a committee source confirmed to HuffPost. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) split with her leadership over the possible need for a special prosecutor to take over the FBI’s Russia investigation.“I think it needs to be considered,” she said. Pressed on whether she thought the timing of Comey’s firing looked suspicious, Murkowski said, “Sure.” Similarly, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) left the door open on whether she thinks a special prosecutor is called for: “I’m not saying yes, but I’m not saying no.”“We need to find out what’s happening and why,” she added. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) also said he wants the White House to start answering questions. “I do have questions about why he was dismissed at this time given his service and performance,” Rubio told reporters, adding that he wants “justification” directly from the White House. “I don’t think someone who served our country the way he has should be notified in the middle of a speech halfway across the country.”Frustrated by the drip-drip of information coming from the White House and FBI surrounding Russia, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) repeated what he’s been calling for since Trump fired his former national security adviser, Gen. Michael Flynn, earlier this year.“I’ve said I want a select committee,” McCain said. “I’ve said I want a select committee. I want a select committee.” This article has been updated to include that acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe will testify this week. "

Democrat Rob Quist, who has refused to accept donations from lobbyists or corporate political action committees, raised over $550,000 in the past four days, his campaign told HuffPost on Wednesday. Campaign contributions, which average $25 and have come from about 147,000 individual donors, now top $3.8 million.“Our campaign has seen a surge in donations and volunteer enthusiasm since New Jersey multimillionaire Greg Gianforte was caught saying one thing to Montanans and the opposite to his D.C. lobbyist donors,” Tina Olechowski, Quist’s spokeswoman, said in a statement. “Every day Montana voters learn more about how Gianforte doesn’t share Montana values, and thanks to the grassroots movement and momentum behind Rob we’ll have the resources we need to win on May 25th.”Democrats, who at first ignored the May 25 special election in Montana, have ramped up fundraising as the race becomes more competitive. The party has sent multiple email blasts soliciting donations. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) endorsed Quist last month. Democratic National Committee chair Tom Perez offered to campaign with him in Montana, although Quist turned down the offer, concerned that it could alienate Republican swing voters. The banjo-strumming folk singer is tailing the deep-pocketed Gianforte, who narrowly lost a race for Montana governor last year, by about 6 points in the latest poll. The GOP has stepped up its support for Gianforte. Last month, the National Rifle Association launched a series of ads attacking Quist for supporting gun control. The president’s eldest son, hunting enthusiast Donald Trump Jr., campaigned with Gianforte last month, and has announced plans to make a return trip. Vice President Mike Pence is slated to visit Billings, Montana’s largest city, on Friday.Quist has countered the NRA blitz with his own ads in which he appears, clad in a cowboy hat, shooting a TV with a rifle. In a state where public land access is a key issue, Quist has repeatedly attacked Gianforte for suing Montana in 2009 to block fishermen from using a river running through his palatial property. But with anemic public support for the American Health Care Act, health care could become an effective wedge issue for Quist as he courts voters outside his base. The bill, which would dramatically scale back protections of the Affordable Care Act, known colloquially as Obamacare, narrowly passed the Republican-controlled House last Thursday. Less than a third of the public favors the new bill, according to a HuffPost/YouGov survey published Monday. A Fox News poll found similar results. On Thursday, as President Donald Trump feted the AHCA’s passage with a flashy, beer-fueled musical celebration, Gianforte declined to comment on the bill. “Greg needs to know all the facts because it’s important to know exactly what’s in the bill before he votes on it,” spokesman Shane Scanlon told the Missoulian.But later that day, Gianforte told lobbyist donors in Washington, D.C., that he backed the bill.“The votes in the House are going to determine whether we get tax reform done, sounds like we just passed a health care thing, which I’m thankful for, sounds like we’re starting to repeal and replace,” Gianforte said, according to audio of the call published by The New York Times. Then, over the weekend, Gianforte told a local CBS affiliate in Montana that he would have voted against the bill, which allows states to waive rules protecting people with pre-existing conditions from being turned away or charged astronomical rates.“I’ve been very clear, to repeal and replace ‘Obamacare’ we must have guarantees here in Montana that rates will go down, rural access will be preserved, and people with pre-existing conditions will be protected,” Gianforte told KPAX. “If I didn’t have that assurance I would have voted against it.”Gianforte has accepted $2 million from the Congressional Leadership Fund, which only supports candidates who back the AHCA. His campaign did not immediately offer a comment Wednesday morning. The personal histories of Gianforte and his opponent play handily into Democrats’ health care narrative. In 1991, Gianforte, a software entrepreneur, settled a lawsuit with a former employee who’d accused Gianforte of firing him for having multiple sclerosis. By contrast, Quist, a musician and son of ranchers whose wife is a real estate agent, spiraled into debt after undergoing a botched surgery that counted as a pre-existing condition, disqualifying him from health insurance. He was forced to sell off part of his family’s ranch and access Social Security early to afford follow-up surgeries and avoid bankruptcy. “Montanans deserve and expect honesty from their representatives but we’ve yet to see that from New Jersey multimillionaire Greg Gianforte,” Olechowski told HuffPost. “All the damage control his wealth can buy can’t walk this back ― Montanans expect straight talk, not a career politician who will only share his true positions with lobbyist donors behind closed doors.”This story has been updated with the latest available contribution figures from Quist’s campaign."

During his term as mayor, Seattle sued President Donald Trump over his executive order cracking down on sanctuary cities that limit their cooperation with federal immigration agents.A primary election for mayor will take place Aug. 1 and the two candidates with the most votes will face off in the Nov. 7 general election.In April, a 46-year-old man sued Murray, claiming that the mayor paid him for sex when he was a homeless, drug-addicted teenager in the 1980s, according to the lawsuit.The Seattle Times newspaper said that in 2008 two other men had accused Murray of abusing them when they were teenagers in the 1980s. Murray has denied those claims, which did not become public until last month.A fourth accuser in a sworn court declaration made similar allegations against Murray, according to the Seattle Times.Murray consistently denied the claims, calling the accusations politically motivated, but also garnered criticism for questioning the trustworthiness of the accusers, which the Seattle Times said had criminal records.An attorney for the first accuser, Lincoln Beauregard, said on Twitter that his client saw the mayor’s withdrawal from the race as “one step towards justice.”Need help?

72,BLACK VOICES,Activists Are Bailing Out Incarcerated Black Moms For Mother’s Day,Lilly Workneh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/activists-are-bailing-out-incarcerated-black-moms-for-mothers-day_us_591344e3e4b05e1ca2040094,"""Our mothers are not disposable. Our mothers deserve restorative justice, healing and reconciliation.”",2017-05-10,Flyers are being distributed by partnering organizations to raise awareness around the campaign. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59134bb61e00003a006224ef.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Activists are banding together to help make this Mother’s Day special for as many incarcerated black women across the country as possible.In the week leading up to the holiday, Black Lives Matter, Color of Change and a dozen other racial and criminal justice organizations are leading a charge to help bail out black moms. Their collective effort is part of a campaign called National Mama’s Bail Out Day, which aims to provide all incarcerated black women ― including those who identify as queer, trans, young, elder and immigrant ― who are unable to afford bail an opportunity to spend the special day with their families. As of Sunday, the groups raised more than $350,000 in individual donations, most of which will go towards bail outs as well as support services.“No one — whether they’re a birth mother, an aunt, or a teacher — should have to spend Mother’s Day in a cell just because they can’t afford bail,” said Rashad Robinson, executive director of Color Of Change, in a statement sent to HuffPost. “For the first time ever, we’re sending that message through a national, coordinated day of action, awareness, and kindness, building on our efforts to fuel decarceration.”“Money bail and the industry that profits from it has long been destroying our communities,” Robinson added, “so this Mother’s Day Black people across the country are going to reunite our families and demand an end to that system.”Throughout the week, organizations in over a dozen cities ― including Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, New Orleans, New York City and St. Petersburg, Florida ― will work with public defenders, community members, churches and other spiritual institutions to raise money to help bail out black mothers. They will also provide helpful resources to those released and host teach-ins that highlight the impact destructive bail practices can have on black families.“Our corrupt criminal justice system forces innocent people who pose no threat to purchase their freedom,” Ruth Jeannoel, a black mother and community organizer, says in a video on the campaign’s site. “The costs are devastating. Women oftentimes lose their homes, jobs or even children just to be found innocent. Some women like Sandra Bland have even lost their lives.”According to the campaign’s site, more than 700,000 people are incarcerated each day because they cannot afford bail and more than $9 billion is spent on men and women who are behind bars but have not yet been convicted of a crime. The statistics around incarcerated women are also staggering. The site states that the number of incarcerated women has increased 700 percent since 1980. It also reports that black and transgender women are both disproportionately represented; black women are twice as likely to be put in jail than white women and 1 in 5 transgender women have spent time behind bars. “Our mamas don’t deserve this. Our mothers are not disposable. Our mothers deserve restorative justice, healing and reconciliation,” Jeannoel says in the video. “Some of them have made mistakes. Some of them get caught up in the system despite their best efforts. All of them deserve to be home.”Mothers account for around 8 in 10 incarcerated women, and a large number have either never been convicted of a crime or have been accused of minor offenses and are unable to post bail, according to the campaign’s site. In court systems around the U.S., people arrested even on minor charges are required to pay bail to get out of jail before trial, regardless of whether they are considered a public safety or flight risk. When defendants can’t afford their freedom, they must either turn to a commercial bail-bondsman ― which typically charges a non-refundable premium of 10 percent of the total bail ― or languish behind bars.The consequences of being stuck in jail before trial can be brutal. Defendants can lose their jobs or access to benefits or housing. They can fall behind on payments. Or they can simply be cut off from their families. These pitfalls affect all defendants, even if they’re not guilty or they never end up going to trial. Pretrial incarceration has been found to increase the odds of future incarceration. In many cases, it effectively pressures defendants to plead guilty to get out of jail, even if they didn’t commit the crime.“We must demand and fight for the ending of money bail and destructive policies that keep putting us in cages and separating us from our communities,” says Mary Hooks, the co-director for Southerners on New Ground, an organization partnering with the campaign. “We are the ones who take care of and hold down our families, chosen and biological. When we, black women and black mamas, are taken from our communities, we all suffer.”Nick Wing contributed to this report."

Early clinical studies have produced promising results, convincing many that psychedelics are at least worthy of further research. But thanks to a grueling approval process and the widespread stigma attached to these drugs, the path to officially recognizing their potential medical benefits has been difficult.A crowdfunding initiative launched Tuesday gives the public a chance to help accelerate this process by donating directly to psychedelic science.The Fundamental campaign has partnered with experts in the field of psychedelic research in hopes of raising $2 million over the next four months. Donated money will be split between four areas. Two studies involve psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy, with one focused on the treatment of end-of-life anxiety and the other on alcoholism. A third study is examining the use of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy to treat post-traumatic stress disorder. The fourth is looking at the effects of LSD-microdosing therapies, which have been touted as a way to enhance mood, cognition, productivity and creativity.New York real estate developer Rodrigo Niño is heading up Fundamental, drawing from his personal experience in the fields of both crowdfunding and psychedelic therapy.In May 2011, Niño realized he had an unusual skin growth. He saw a doctor, and days later received a devastating diagnosis: At 41, Niño had stage 3 melanoma. His odds of survival were 1 in 3 over the next five years.Niño underwent a pair of procedures in the following months to remove cancerous growths, but he remained haunted by anxiety that the disease would kill him. In the summer of 2011, Niño traveled to the Peruvian Amazon, where he partook in a number of ayahuasca ceremonies over the next few weeks. He returned home completely changed.“I got completely over my fear of dying,” Niño told HuffPost.Although the ayahuasca felt like a miracle cure for his anxiety, Niño wasn’t sure if his newfound sense of calm was a placebo effect, or if the psychedelic jungle vine had actually altered his brain chemistry.Back in New York, Niño met with Stephen Ross, director of addiction psychiatry at NYU Langone Medical Center, who explained to him that psilocybin ― a psychoactive ingredient different from the one found in ayahuasca ― had begun to show promising results as a treatment for end-of-life anxiety. Over the next few years, Niño’s interest in the therapeutic applications of psychedelic drugs grew, as did the body of scientific research.This past December, Ross and researchers at Johns Hopkins University published the results of two separate clinical trials on the effects of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy on patients with cancer-related anxiety and depression. All told, between 60 and 80 percent of the subjects showed clinically significant reductions in both psychological disorders after treatment. Patients reported that the benefits of a single dose of psilocybin along with therapy lasted up to seven months, with minimal side effects.Now, Fundamental is hoping to provide Ross with the money to explore this preliminary research in the kind of large-scale trials necessary to better understand the therapeutic value of psilocybin.“The problem with funding for psychedelic research is it’s incredibly hard to do,” Ross explains in a video for Fundamental. “The federal government will give approval through the [Food and Drug Administration] and the DEA, but the [National Institutes of Health] agencies don’t appear yet ready to fund psychedelic research.”Fundamental is also raising money for research on the effects of psilocybin-assisted treatment on alcoholism, which Michael Bogenschutz at NYU Langone is heading up. Initial studies have shown promise, building on a rich history of anecdotal evidence that psychedelic drugs could help people battle addiction.“If we had more funding, we could accelerate the rate of the research, we could accelerate potential discoveries and breakthroughs, and we could accelerate the rate at which these medicines may become available to alleviate human suffering,” Ross says in the video.Part of the challenge in financing psychedelic research is that there’s no profit motive for large pharmaceutical companies, Niño says. These studies don’t focus on treating symptoms. Rather, they’re trying to address the root cause of mental illness by essentially disrupting the default mode network, or ego, of a person’s brain. In other words, they’re trying to eliminate the need for treatment, not offer an ongoing one.“The problem is that these natural compounds sometimes require only two sessions to do what a lifetime of treatment wouldn’t do with traditional antidepressants,” Niño told HuffPost. “They don’t really make money, because they’re also in the public domain and they can’t be patented.”But Niño hopes that Fundamental can help create a movement around the issue of psychedelic research and therapy.“We’re trying to inspire people to realize that despite the fact this doesn’t make money, it’s something that must happen for the sake of everybody,” he said.Fundamental has also partnered with Rick Doblin, executive director of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, which is beginning phase three clinical trials on MDMA as a treatment for PTSD. Phase three is the final step before a medication can officially be approved by the FDA as a prescription drug ― a goal MAPS is hoping to reach by 2021.Early studies on MDMA and PTSD have produced impressive results, with one trial showing nearly 70 percent effectiveness in reducing symptoms after a handful of sessions of MDMA-assisted therapy.For Fundamental’s fourth initiative, the campaign has joined forces with psychedelic pioneer Amanda Feilding to look into the science of microdosing with LSD ― a pursuit that’s become popular in recent years, especially in the fast-paced world of Silicon Valley.Feilding is the founder and director of the Beckley Foundation, a think tank that advocates for psychedelic research. Her latest project seeks to gain a better understanding of how small amounts of LSD can affect human performance and brain function. Feilding’s study involves doing brain imaging on a small number of subjects while they engage in a variety of cognitive tasks. Participants will also play the ancient Chinese board game Go against a computer. Feilding hopes this will allow her to examine how LSD changes brain connectivity and contributes to enhanced creativity or problem-solving skills.If all of this research seems a bit, well, out there, that’s not unreasonable. Niño says it’s fair to be skeptical and it’s critical to proceed with caution, which is exactly why rigorous scientific studies like these are needed.“We think that psychedelics don’t create addiction based on the evidence, but we need to confirm it,” he said. “We think that it will help with depression and end-of-life anxiety and so on and so forth, but we need to scientifically confirm it as well.”And though Niño suggested these studies could help break the stigma surrounding psychedelics, perhaps even putting them on the road to legalization, he said that was far beyond the scope of the Fundamental campaign.“This is not an invitation to do illicit drugs of any sort,” Niño said. “This is an invitation to collectively back up the researchers who are finding out whether this has potential or not, as the evidence is showing it does on a preliminary basis.”Fundamental is collecting money through the website CrowdRise. Donations will be deposited into an account controlled by a third-party group, Charity Aid Foundations of America. When the campaign closes on Sept. 9, the money will be distributed as grants among the different research programs."

The White House declared the meeting with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to be closed press, meaning that reporters couldn’t attend and cover independently.But one outlet did get in: TASS, a Russian state media organization.In addition, Russia’s foreign ministry quickly distributed photos of the Trump meeting with Lavrov and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. And the Russian embassy even tweeted a shot of the president and Kislyak. On MSNBC, Andrea Mitchell expressed disbelief over the White House giving Russian state-run media access to a meeting that was closed to U.S. press. “The Russians had it all out globally while the White House press corps was kept out,” Mitchell said. “It’s unprecedented.”Several journalists also highlighted the unusual situation whereby the U.S. press became reliant on Russian government handouts for details about the U.S. president’s meeting. An unnamed White House official tried explaining TASS’s access in a statement to The Hill’s Jordan Fabian, who served as pool reporter on Wednesday afternoon. “Our official photographer and their official photographer were present, that’s it,” the official said.

In terms of the show’s popularity, Browning told CNN that the popularity is partly driven by the characters’ resonance with viewers.“I just love when people relate to specific characters because that means they’re feeling represented,” she said. “To be able to relate to [a character] and see your story in them, it makes you feel seen and gives you confidence to be you ― and not just be the label version of you.”Let’s keep the trend going, Hollywood!"

During the interview, she shared her own parenting methods, including her attempts to make tasks that aren’t particularly fun “apply to their curiosity level.” For example, she often has to put sunscreen on her girls in the morning, and they used to hate it, Bell said. “But now, first of all I let them see me put it on because I think they give me a lot more respect when they’re mimicking what I’m doing,” she said, adding that they do the same thing with brushing their teeth. “It’s about giving them some control over what I’m asking them to do, and it really has helped a ton.”Bell also spoke about the ways she encourages her daughters to communicate and cope with their feelings. “I stopped saying, ‘It’s OK,’ to anything in their lives,” she explained. “My older daughter gets embarrassed a lot, and I don’t say, ‘It’s OK.

Sometimes I trip and I feel embarrassed or I break a bowl and I feel embarrassed.

During the interview, she shared her own parenting methods, including her attempts to make tasks that aren’t particularly fun “apply to their curiosity level.” For example, she often has to put sunscreen on her girls in the morning, and they used to hate it, Bell said. “But now, first of all I let them see me put it on because I think they give me a lot more respect when they’re mimicking what I’m doing,” she said, adding that they do the same thing with brushing their teeth. “It’s about giving them some control over what I’m asking them to do, and it really has helped a ton.”Bell also spoke about the ways she encourages her daughters to communicate and cope with their feelings. “I stopped saying, ‘It’s OK,’ to anything in their lives,” she explained. “My older daughter gets embarrassed a lot, and I don’t say, ‘It’s OK. It’s OK.’ I simply sit next to her and I say, ‘Do you feel embarrassed?’ And she’ll say, ‘Yes.’ And I say, ‘I feel embarrassed, too, sometimes. Sometimes I trip and I feel embarrassed or I break a bowl and I feel embarrassed. I used to feel embarrassed a lot more as a kid, but as you become an adult, some of that stuff goes away.’”Bell said that this is her way of letting her daughters experience and understand their feelings. “I think saying, ‘It’s OK,’ all the time doesn’t do anyone any favors. It just makes them subconsciously think that they’re not supposed to be having those feelings,” she noted.“We tell them to have any feelings — even if it’s a tantrum and they’re screaming and crying,” the actress added. “I say, ‘You know what? You are allowed to be sad right now. You are allowed to be angry — that’s OK. But, you cannot be angry and sad in the middle of the living room while we’re having dinner. You’re welcome to go up to your bedroom and cry, but you’re not allowed to ruin everybody else’s evening because you’re having a tantrum.’”Read the full interview on Today to learn Bell’s thoughts on the value of sleep, sharing parenting tasks with her husband and more."

The debate over 2016 continues. And pollsters called the French presidential election correctly, but missed on the margin. This is HuffPollster for Tuesday, May 9, 2017.REPUBLICANS’ NEW HEALTH BILL IS UNPOPULAR WITH THE PUBLIC - HuffPollster: “Less than a third of the public favors the new Republican health care bill just passed by the House of Representatives, a HuffPost/YouGov survey finds. Thirty-one percent of Americans favor the American Health Care Act, which narrowly passed the Republican-controlled House last Thursday. Forty-four percent oppose the bill, which would repeal much of the current health care law. Another 25 percent are unsure. As was the case during the GOP’s failed attempt to pass the bill in March, Americans are more likely to be intensely opposed than even modestly supportive. Just 8 percent say they favor the bill strongly, with 34 percent strongly opposed. Americans say, 39 percent to 26 percent, that the AHCA would likely be worse, not better, than the current health care law.” [HuffPost]But it consolidates Trump voters’ support - More: “Trump voters have now coalesced around the bill in a way they failed to do earlier this spring. The first version of the AHCA faced loud, public opposition from some Republican factions. The fact wasn’t lost on most of the public, just 11 percent of whom said they believed congressional Republicans were united in support of the bill. That lack of partisan unity may have helped to depress support among Trump voters, just half of whom said they favored the bill in March. With the latest version of the AHCA passing the House, there’s now something closer to an official GOP party line on the bill ― and Trump voters have largely taken the cue. Seventy-five percent now favor the bill at least somewhat, with just 9 percent opposed.”Current ratings for the ACA: An average 48 percent of the public favors the current health care law, with 42 percent opposed, according to HuffPost Pollster’s aggregate. Ratings for the law have been positive since last year’s election. [Pollster chart]EDUCATION WAS A BIG FACTOR IN HOW PEOPLE VOTED IN 2016 ― WHICH MAY HAVE HURT SOME STATE POLLING - HuffPollster: “Voters’ level of education closely tracked with the candidate they backed in key states in the 2016 election, but state-level polling failed to place enough emphasis on education to accurately reflect that, according to a new report. While voters with a college degree were more likely to support Hillary Clinton, those who didn’t attend college tended to back Donald Trump. National-level polls predicted Clinton would win the popular vote by 3 percentage points, when she actually won it by 2 ― so those were fairly accurate. But polls were way off the mark in key states such as Michigan (6 points off), Wisconsin (7 points) and Pennsylvania (5 points) ― and Trump’s victories there helped him gain the Electoral College votes necessary to become president. State-level polling didn’t survey enough voters without a college education ― which may be a big reason they overestimated Clinton’s support, a topic discussed in the report issued Thursday by the American Association for Public Opinion Research on what went wrong in 2016. The report found many state-level pollsters weren’t accounting for the fact that those with college degrees are significantly more likely to take surveys. While pollsters weight their survey responses to reflect a representative balance of people based on demographics such as age, gender, race and political party, not all weight them based on education.” [HuffPost]STUDY: “CULTURAL ANXIETY” DROVE WHITE WORKING-CLASS VOTERS TO TRUMP - Emma Green on a new PRRI/The Atlantic report: “Evidence suggests financially troubled voters in the white working class actually preferred Clinton over Trump. Besides partisan affiliation, it was cultural anxiety—feeling like a stranger in America, supporting the deportation of immigrants, and hesitating about educational investment—that best predicted support for Trump.….Controlling for other demographic variables, three factors stood out as strong independent predictors of how white working-class people would vote. The first was anxiety about cultural change….The second factor was immigration….Finally, 54 percent of white working-class Americans said investing in college education is a risky gamble, including 61 percent of white working-class men. White working-class voters who held this belief were almost twice as likely as their peers to support Trump….While the analysis pointed to some interesting patterns around economic status, more research is needed to confirm them.” [The Atlantic, more from PRRI]WAS THERE A ‘COMEY EFFECT’ IN 2016? - Nate Cohn argues there’s reason to be skeptical: “[I]t’s now clear that Mrs. Clinton was weaker heading into Oct. 28 than was understood at the time. Several other polls were conducted over the same period that showed Mr. Trump gaining quickly on Mrs. Clinton in the days ahead of the Comey letter. And the timing of these polls — particularly the gap between when they were taken and when they were released — has probably helped to exaggerate the effect of Mr. Comey’s letter on the presidential race….[P]olls taken before the letter were as bad for Mrs. Clinton as those conducted after it….taken at face value there’s a case that Mrs. Clinton had nearly or even completely bottomed out by the time the Comey letter was released. Even if she had not, the trend line heading into the Comey letter was bad enough that there’s no need to assume that the Comey letter was necessary for any additional erosion in her lead….This doesn’t mean that Mr. Comey didn’t or couldn’t have played a pivotal role. The fairly sparse polling makes it hard to be sure of just how much Mrs. Clinton’s standing fell before the Comey letter.” [NYT]Nate Silver disagrees - Silver, via Twitter: “This is a good, interesting point but isn’t large enough to mitigate the Comey effect. Nate C. is right to point out that there’s a lag between when polls are conducted and when they become publicly available. FiveThirtyEight’s model at 12:01 am on Oct. 28 (Comey letter day), based on *available* polls, had Clinton up 5.9 points. What if we run the model with all polls that had been *conducted* before Comey even if they hadn’t been released? Clinton up 5.2 instead. In other words, accounting for poll timing reduces the Comey effect by 0.7 points. But that would leave you with a 2 or 2.5-point effect…and Clinton lost the tipping-point state, Wisconsin, by only 0.8 points. People seem to forget how narrow Trump’s victory was.” [@NateSilver538]Pollsters see “mixed” evidence - An American Association for Public Opinion Research report released last week: “[G]iven the volume of claims that the FBI announcement of October 28th tipped the race in Trump’s favor, we felt it worthwhile to investigate whether there was support for that claim in the public polls….While [Clinton’s lead] was eroding before October 28th, it is possible that the FBI letter news story made that erosion more severe than it otherwise would have been...Based on all of the data examined here, we would conclude there is at best mixed evidence to suggest that the FBI announcement tipped the scales of the race.” [AAPOR]FRENCH POLLS UNDERSTATED EMMANUEL MACRON’S VICTORY: Harry Enten: “Emmanuel Macron’s 32-percentage-point victory in France’s presidential election runoff may end up being touted as a triumph for French pollsters, who consistently gave him a huge advantage. But it shouldn’t be. The polls leading up to the contest between the centrist Macron and his far-right opponent were the least predictive in French history, underestimating Macron’s support, rather than Marine Le Pen’s, to the surprise of some….The average poll conducted in the final two weeks of the campaign gave Macron a far smaller lead (22 percentage points) than he ended up winning by (32 points), for a 10-point miss. In the eight previous presidential election runoffs, dating back to 1969, the average poll missed the margin between the first- and second-place finishers by only 3.9 points….Most elections aren’t that close, so pollsters usually get the winner and loser right. If you’re focusing only on who won and who lost, you’ll end up with the impression that pollsters are far more accurate than they really are.” [538]Want to get updates on new HuffPost/YouGov polls, the latest survey news, and other Pollster content?

So, to commemorate Wim’s milestone birthday, he asked his wife and two adult children to travel to their favorite vacation spot in Cornwall, England and have a family photoshoot inspired by the fantasy series.The whole Tilkin clan was game — but the geekiness doesn’t end there.Wim explained to HuffPost that he also wanted the photos to have a storyline inspired by “Game of Thrones.”“The story we made is ‘in style’ with the series but has nothing to do with the characters and the books,” he told HuffPost.In the photo series, dubbed “The Goron Chronicles,” Wim plays a Cornish lord named Goron who is forced by his king to fight evil forces threatening their kingdom. Goron goes to battle, and heroics, jealousy and encounters with witches ensue.Wim even grew out his beard and hair for nine months before the photoshoot in order to resemble what he envisioned Goron to look like.“People at work started to see me as a strange wildling and ignored me,” Wim told HuffPost.Yet, all that preparation paid off. The family headed to Cornwall in late March for the magical photoshoot.Check out the epic photos from the Tilkin’s vacation and read “The Goron Chronicles” storyline below:Meet Cornish landlord Goron and his family.Mordred, Goron’s king, summons him to his chamber and forces the lord to fight against evil forces threatening the kingdom.Goron complies and prepares for battle.Goron returns from battle a hero, which makes his king jealous.Mordred sends Gwenora, a blue witch, to seduce Goron to the dark side.Goron is enticed by Gwenora and turns him against his own people.Goron is tortured by his betrayal.Torn by his actions, Goron struggles to find the courage to fight Gwenora.When he finally finds his strength …… he confronts the witch.And prevails.Watch your back, Cersei.

This year’s cards focus on immigrant and Muslim families.“Since the start of [the Trump] administration we’ve seen executive orders that target both communities,” Kalpana Krishnamurthy, policy director at Forward Together, told HuffPost in an email.“There are many ways to resist Trump’s policies ― and Forward Together encourages our supporters to contact members of Congress, call the White House, etc,” she went on. “We can also resist by supporting individual Mamas and their families with extra love and support.”Forward Together plans to print and mail the cards to 28 partner organizations, including the Council on American-Islamic Relations and the Black Alliance for Just Immigration, to distribute at mosques and community centers.Since 2011, Forward Together has made Mother’s Day cards that counter “traditional ideas of family and motherhood,” as the group’s website puts it. Last year, for instance, the group made and distributed cards for undocumented mothers in detention centers. This year will mark the first time it has created cards specifically for Muslim moms, Krishnamurthy said.Over the past two years, Trump’s speeches and policies have repeatedly targeted immigrants and Muslims. His signature issues have included a promise to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and attempts to ban travel to the U.S. from certain Muslim-majority countries ― orders that have since been blocked by the courts.A surge in anti-Muslim hate crimes has occurred since the November presidential election, including vandalism and property destruction at mosques and Islamic community centers across the country. The Muslim Association of Puget Sound (MAPS) in Redmond, Washington, for example, was targeted twice in December alone.“After our mosque did have its sign vandalized twice in less than a month, what was so inspiring and filled us with hope and strength was the outpouring of community support,” Aneelah Afzali, executive director of MAPS’ American Muslim Empowerment Network, which is participating in the Forward Together campaign, told HuffPost.“Some community members put handwritten cards of love and support on the cars parked at our mosque during congregational prayers,” she went on. “Even if such acts may seem small, the power and potential of this gesture of love overpowering hate is profound.”You can send a card to Muslim and immigrant moms on the Forward Together website. Simply select an illustrated card and type in a personalized note, or choose from a list of pre-written messages.One of the messages reads: “You are welcome here. Your family is welcome here.”For those who want to support the Muslim community beyond Mother’s Day, Afzali suggested a few easy ways: Get to know your Muslim neighbors by visiting a local mosque, educate yourself on Islam, and ― most importantly, she said ― speak out about the positive contributions of Muslim-Americans you know.“Help personalize American Muslims for our fellow Americans,” Afzali said. “Help our fellow Americans get to know who American Muslims really are. This is especially important as many Americans have been filled with so much fear and hate that they may not even be willing to get to know a Muslim or visit a mosque. Our friends and allies can possibly change their hearts and minds, and show that love is greater than hate.”For HuffPost’s #LoveTakesAction series, we’re telling stories of how people are standing up to hate and supporting those most threatened.

White said Washington would still prioritize supplying those Arab fighters within the SDF.Mattis, speaking before the announcement, sounded upbeat about working through tensions with Ankara when speaking to reporters in Denmark after talks with coalition officials, including from Turkey.“Our intent is to work with the Turks, alongside one another, to take Raqqa down, and we’re going to sort it out and we’ll figure out how we’re going to do it,” Mattis told a news conference.Ankara had long argued that Washington should switch support for the planned assault on Raqqa from the Kurdish YPG militia to Syrian rebels Turkey has trained and led against Islamic State for the past year.But the U.S. administration was skeptical that the Turkish-backed force was large enough or sufficiently trained.White appeared to allude to that conclusion when she said: “The SDF, partnered with enabling support from U.S. and coalition forces, are the only force on the ground that can successfully seize Raqqa in the near future.”One U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, did not disclose how soon arms would start being delivered to the Kurdish fighters.Another U.S. official said the equipment could include small arms, ammunition, machine guns, armored vehicles, and engineering equipment.Saleh Muslim, co-chair of the Syrian Kurdish PYD party, the YPG’s political affiliate, said the U.S. decision was expected.“The Raqqa campaign is running in parallel with the international coalition against terrorism.

That individual, who spoke with the news site on the condition of anonymity, said he continued to follow up with authorities on the investigation’s progress, though he wasn’t personally slighted by Fry’s remarks.Authorities this week said they were unable to find “a substantial number of outraged people” and they are therefore concluding their investigation, the paper reported, citing an unnamed source close to the investigation.The man who reported Fry’s interview to police said he’s content with authorities’ handling of the case.“I did my civic duty in reporting it. The guards did their duty in investigating it. I am satisfied with the result and I don’t want to comment further,” he told the paper.Though Fry’s comments about God failed to ignite a firestorm of outrage against him, it did spark anger over the law, as well as demands for its removal.Ireland’s Minister for Health Simon Harris addressed the law on Monday, saying it’s “silly, a little embarrassing and needs to change.”“This is a democracy, and people have the right to express whatever view they do,” he said.Eoin Daly, a lecturer in law at the National University of Ireland, Galway, told the New York Times that the law is in place only because the country’s 1937 constitution requires it. Lawmakers obediently followed through on crafting such a regulation but made it so that it is “almost unenforceable,” he said.“There was a constitutional obligation to legislate this offense, but it was not against the constitution to create an offense that was of no use,” he said.The British Humanist Association and Atheist Ireland, which both spoke up in Fry’s defense, stressed that even if law enforcement agencies don’t prosecute such cases, just having the laws there puts the public at risk.“Blasphemy laws in England and Wales were repealed in 2008, but nonetheless remain on the books in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Neither law has been used in some time, but that was also true in Denmark, until its ‘dead’ blasphemy law was resurrected a couple of months ago, to bring charges against someone for the first time in 46 years,” the BHA said in a statement on Tuesday.Atheist Ireland made a similar point while flagging the reason for the case’s dismissal: the lack of outraged people.“The Gardai have not denied that the comments were grossly abusive or insulting in relation to matter held sacred by a religion,” the organization stated on its website. “Instead, the reported reason is that the Gardai failed to find a large number of people outraged by the comments.”Atheist Ireland stressed that even if legislators pass a law that they believe won’t be enforced, the country’s law enforcement officers will.“The police take our blasphemy law seriously, as indeed they should do, regardless of the nod and wink attitude of our legislators,” they stated. “We don’t know when the next investigation might happen, or what the outcome might be. But we know that it will have to involve a large number of people demonstrating outrage.”"

John Faso (R-N.Y.) voted for the GOP health care bill. Some of his constituents are pretty mad about it.,2017-05-09,Rep. John Faso (R-N.Y.) had a seat reserved at an event in his district. He didn't use it.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591210f41600002000c5a46b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"KINGSTON, N.Y. — The residents of New York’s 19th Congressional District have some questions about the health care bill that House Republicans passed last week. Unfortunately for them, Rep. John Faso, the local Republican who voted for the legislation, isn’t around to answer them right now.Congress is on recess this week, but most House Republicans aren’t holding open town hall meetings in their districts. Seeing an opportunity to make hay over the unpopular bill, Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, a Democrat from New York’s neighboring 18th District, paid a visit to Faso’s home territory Monday evening for an event organized by Maloney’s re-election campaign and local progressive groups.“Hey, listen. I have a question for you. I’m Representative Sean Patrick Maloney. Where the heck is your congressman?” he said. “As of tonight, I have now done more open, no-holds-barred public town hall meetings in New York 19 than John Faso has.”Billed as a town hall, Monday’s gathering was more akin to a rally. Maloney stoked the friendly audience into applause, whoops and hollers as he took questions and speechified over the course of more than 90 minutes.Maloney hatched this “Adopt a District” plan during an appearance on MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” last week, and it might catch on. In Arizona, Rep. Ruben Gallego (D) is expected to travel to the district of Rep. Martha McSally (R) for a public event Tuesday.The crowd seemed happy to hear Maloney’s criticism of the American Health Care Act ― and his jabs at Faso, who the Democrat said was attending a fundraiser in Albany that night. “You may have noticed we have two stools here,” Maloney said at one point. “One is for me. This one is for John Faso, in case he shows up.”“I’m here tonight because I’m pissed off that John Faso won’t have a town hall,” Catherine Joyner, a resident of Faso’s district, told HuffPost before the event. “I think he’s not here because he’s a big, old, fat coward, that’s why. He’s refusing to talk to the general public. It’s ridiculous.”Just 17 of 238 House Republicans have town hall meetings scheduled during the lower chamber’s two-week break from Washington, according to a list compiled by the Town Hall Project.It’s not hard to see why: President Donald Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) hurried the health care bill through the House, making significant changes to the legislation just before the vote, and asking GOP lawmakers to go along without an analysis from the Congressional Budget Office and amid widespread criticism of the plan.Earlier on Monday, Faso appeared at a meeting of the New York Statewide Senior Action Council elsewhere in his district. According to Ulster County Executive Mike Hein (D), who spoke at Maloney’s event, questions for Faso at that meeting were pre-screened.At the evening event in Kingston, Faso took a beating in absentia ― the audience chanted “No-show Faso!” ― but he did avoid the attacks other House Republicans have endured over health care, like Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) and Rep. Rod Blum (R-Iowa), who had a rough day Monday.Anxiety over the health care bill’s gigantic cuts to Medicaid and its weakening of the Affordable Care Act’s protections for people with pre-existing conditions has stoked political activism among people in Faso’s district who haven’t been much involved before, Joyner said.“I’ve been out canvassing in New Paltz, New York, twice now,” said Joyner, who’s volunteering with a local chapter of the grassroots movement known as Indivisible. “I have not had anyone tell us they they were a Faso fan.”“Everybody’s very, very concerned about the way John Faso voted for health care, and everybody seems to be as scared as I am,” she went on.Renee Woodward, who also lives in Faso’s district, agreed.“I haven’t been politically active, like, really since college. But things have gotten so out of whack, and I was feeling very angry and depressed,” she said. “I was very upset when the bill passed the House, and I also think it’s going to be a disaster for millions of Americans.”One of those people could be Andrea Mitchell, a woman who made news in February when she spoke to Faso during a rally outside his home in Kinderhook, New York. Mitchell told Faso she had a brain tumor and other serious medical issues, and that she’d lost her insurance due to her health before the Affordable Care Act made that illegal.Faso hugged Mitchell that day and promised to protect her health care. He would ultimately vote for the American Health Care Act.At Maloney’s event Monday, Mitchell rose to tell her story again.“The burden of the bill to keep someone that you love alive is not something that any family in America ― or anywhere in the world, but especially in America ― should ever have to deal with,” she said.“John Faso,” she said, pausing for a moment, “was less than sincere in that promise.”Maloney urged the audience members to get active, and to think about running for office. “The good news is, there are a lot of people who can be in Congress, ladies and gentlemen,” he said. “Next year, we’re going to have an opportunity to change the whole course of this thing.”Maloney said Faso would pay a “big price” for his health care vote, and Democrats have their eyes on this seat in 2018, but it will almost certainly be a challenge. Faso defeated progressive Democrat Zephyr Teachout last year by more than 9 percentage points, and Trump beat Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton by nearly 7 percentage points in this district.Outside the meeting hall after Monday’s event, Gareth Rhodes, a Kingston native and former aide to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), told HuffPost he planned to take a run at Faso’s seat anyway. Rhodes said he’d filed the necessary paperwork earlier that day. “Last Thursday was the last straw for me,” he said, referring to the House passing the GOP bill. “I’m going to stand up. I’m going to fight back.”Gemma Sapwell contributed reporting."
