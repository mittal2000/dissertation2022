The claims against Weinstein, detailed at length in a bombshell New York Times story published Thursday, are similar in nature to those brought by some of Bloom’s past clients. She represented some of the women accusing then-Fox News host Bill O’Reilly of sexual harassment earlier this year. She also took on the cases of several women who accused Donald Trump of sexual misconduct during his presidential campaign and represented model Janice Dickinson in her defamation suit against Bill Cosby. (Bloom follows in the footsteps of her mother, attorney Gloria Allred, who has earned fame handling high-profile cases, especially in defense of women.) Now Bloom is aiding a Hollywood executive accused of repeatedly exploiting his powerful position to make sexual advances on women.But Weinstein and Bloom have an earlier business connection. Weinstein, along with Jay Z, is producing the TV adaptation of her 2014 book, Suspicion Nation, which examines the trial of Trayvon Martin’s killer.Bloom tweeted the news in April:According to Variety, Weinstein and Jay Z are set to produce a six-part documentary miniseries based on Bloom’s work. The series will also draw from Rest in Power, a memoir written by Martin’s parents earlier this year. The series is scheduled to premiere in 2018 on Spike TV, which will by then be rebranded as Paramount Network.In a statement released Thursday shortly after the publication of the Times exposé, Bloom said that she and Weinstein have had “many wide ranging conversations over the last year about rumors and allegations against him” and that he denies those allegations as “patently false.”“As a women’s rights advocate, I have been blunt with Harvey and he has listened to me,” she said. “I have told him that times have changed, it is 2017, and he needs to evolve to a higher standard. I have found Harvey to be refreshingly candid and receptive to my message. He has acknowledged mistakes he has made. He is reading books and going to therapy. He is an old dinosaur learning new ways.” "

He made the comment after Cruz, whose city is Puerto Rico’s largest, complained about the federal response to the damage wrought to the island by Hurricane Marie.“Unfortunately, his visit to Puerto Rico, this week, did not assure me of healing and I was hoping for healing and instead his comparisons and complaints gauged deeper wounds,” Weaver said.Trump, while in Puerto Rico on Tuesday, said Maria was not “a real catastrophe” like Hurricane Katrina, given that many more people died in the 2005 storm that hammered Louisiana and Mississippi. He also complained that helping Puerto Rico recover from Maria would affect the federal budget, and he casually threw paper towels at suffering survivors.Prior to his visit, Trump had attacked Cruz for “poor leadership.”“The people need a voice, and as elected officials, we are the voice of the people that we took an oath to serve,” Weaver said in her letter. “I commend you for shouting, screaming, yelling if necessary to get the response the people of San Juan deserve. It is our duty to our citizens. It is our families, our friends, and our neighbors, we are serving.”Weaver knows all-too-well what it’s like to confront a civic catastrophe and what it takes to protect the public ― she has had to deal with Flint’s water crisis since she won election in November 2015. Beginning in 2014, city’s water source was contaminated with lead ― a problem caused by an effort to save money and exacerbated by city and state officials who downplayed the crisis.In her letter, Weaver noted that Flint’s still drink bottled or filtered water while they wait for the more than 18,000 lead-tainted service lines to be replaced, a task that remains years from completion.“This is why I feel a special sisterhood, and connection to your concern for your community, and your desperate plea for action,” Weaver said to Cruz. “We cannot sit idly back and allow more people to become infected with disease and illnesses. We cannot allow the slow walking of aid, and the tying of victims’ hands with bureaucracy. It is fair for us to demand clear answers.” "

That was a rebuttal.For the record, I am in full support for a complete exchange in the U.S. ― all gun owners swapping those weapons for bats.I shouldn’t have been surprised, and I was disappointed, however, when I waded into the Las Vegas shooting with my college students. My university population is skewed socially and politically conservative as well as traditionally Christian. Although the college was once affiliated with the Southern Baptist church, that ended decades ago and the school was never a religious college.I always die a little on the inside when I share the research base solidly refuting corporal punishment, prompting several students to respond angrily in favor of spanking: “I was spanked and I turned out fine,” the typical rebuttal as hollow as the bat argument above.Three first year students were more than bothered and eager to challenge the concerns I raised in our first-year seminar about access to guns in the U.S. and the uniquely violent culture of our country when compared internationally.Their arguments fell into three categories: adamant commitments to owning guns for self defense (with the undercurrent that home invasions are somehow an ever-present danger), a belief that the Second Amendment was in part designed to allow U.S. citizens to defend themselves against a rogue U.S. government (and that remains relevant in 2017), and the recognition that many in the U.S. cling to gun ownership as a symbol for individual freedom (one student noted that his family owns several guns but they never use them in any way).One similarity to my students’ arguments and the push-back on Facebook has been the sense of fatalism—there simply is no way to end all gun violence or all violence so let’s not restrict our freedom, again represented by merely owning a gun.In class, I found data on international comparisons showing that the U.S. is an extreme outlier for rates of gun violence, and I posed the idea that wouldn’t we all take the rates of next highest nation (a much lower rate) if that were possible through policy change.And with that, I argued that we are all complicit in our violent nation, our gun-lust: This is America. This is who we are.My students who defended gun rights immediately balked at the carnage of LasVegas is something the citizens of the U.S. have chosen.Facebook ignorance has become nearly as commonplace as mass shootings in the U.S. But I have tried to remain hopeful about young people, that the future can hold a better us: “This place could be beautiful,/right? You could make this place beautiful.”As my students demonstrate, young people have been engrained with irrational but compelling beliefs that are not supported by evidence; entrenched symbolism remains powerful in the U.S. well beyond the origins of those symbols.The practical and very real importance of guns in the founding and expansion of the U.S. certainly contrasts significantly with today—but the symbolism (guns equal freedom) endures.Symbolism and the resulting fatalism are the death of us as a people—unless somehow we are able to make facts matter. Otherwise, our future is as dim as our past and our present.Suggested ReadingsHow dangerous people get their weapons in AmericaSix things to know about mass shootings in AmericaWhen gun control makes a difference: 4 essential reads1,516 mass shootings in 1,735 days: America’s gun crisis – in one chartAmerica’s unique gun violence problem, explained in 17 maps and chartsVisualizing gun deaths: Comparing the U.S. to rest of the world@JamesFallows offers two dark American truths from Las VegasIn the U.S., Where the Female Nipple Is More Dangerous Than a Gun"

Hawija is near the Kurdish-held oil city of Kirkuk.“The army’s 9th armored division, the Federal Police, the Emergency Response division and (..) Popular Mobilization liberated Hawija,” said a statement from the joint operations commander, Lieutenant-General Abdul Ameer Rasheed Yarallah.The offensive on Hawija was carried out by U.S.-backed Iraqi government troops and Iranian-trained and armed Shi’ite paramilitary groups known as Popular Mobilization.The capture of Hawija brings them into direct contact with Kurdish Peshmerga fighters who control Kirkuk, a multi-ethnic region claimed by both Baghdad and the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG).Kirkuk shaped up as a flashpoint last month when the KRG included the city in a referendum on Kurdish independence in northern Iraq.Iraq launched its offensive on Sept. 21 to dislodge Islamic State from the Hawija area, where up to 78,000 people were estimated to be trapped, according to the United Nations.The militants continue to control the border town of al-Qaim and the region surrounding it.They also hold parts of the Syrian side of the border, but the area under their control is shrinking as they retreat in the face of two different sets of hostile forces - a U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led coalition and Syrian government troops with foreign Shi’ite militias backed by Iran and Russia.Islamic State’s cross-border “caliphate” effectively collapsed in July, when U.S.-backed Iraqi forces captured Mosul, the group’s de facto capital in Iraq, in a grueling battle which lasted nine months.The militants’ leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who declared the caliphate from Mosul in mid-2014, released an audio recording last week that indicated he was alive, after several reports he had been killed.He called on his followers to keep up the fight despite the setbacks."

And somebody is in New York and somebody is in Philadelphia and then maybe there’s a choir in Philadelphia. And then it’s photo shoots, video shoots, you’re in dance rehearsals and then you’re maybe on a festival tour at the same time over here and you’re getting ready for your regular tour, so it’s rehearsals and it’s putting on shows. And then your 6-year-old has surf camp and your 8-year-old has a vaccination and then your album is out.”When someone behind the camera points out to Pink that her son, Jameson, is actually 8 months old at that time, not years, the singer has a funny response.“I said 8-year-old?” she says. “Ah, shit.”Many fans replied to Pink’s trailer to laugh at the funny moment and praise her for being there for her kids. One mom joked that she had also experienced “#mombrain” from time to time.You’re not alone, Pink."

Staff reportedly discovered a suspected breach on the phone that has since raised concerns hackers may have been able to access the data on Kelly’s phone for months. It’s unclear if anything was accessed on the device.The White House said Kelly’s phone stopped working last year and that he has since stopped using it, although officials did not specify when use of the device ended.“Last December, Gen. Kelly’s personal phone stopped working and he discontinued its use,” Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters said in an email.An official in the Trump administration told Politico Kelly didn’t frequently use his personal phone, relying primarily on a government-issued one, and has since switched to a new personal device.Several senior White House staff have come under fire in recent weeks for using private email servers, including the president’s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, former chief strategist Steve Bannon and former chief of staff Reince Priebus. Trump frequently attacked Democratic presidential rival Hillary Clinton during the campaign for her own use of a private email server, saying it presented national security issues.Trump’s own cell phone use came under scrutiny during the campaign and in the early days of his administration, as he reportedly used a Samsung device running an Android operating system that was unsecured. He began tweeting from an iPhone in late March.He isn’t the first president to have phone security issues. Former President Barack Obama was notoriously irked with the BlackBerry he was required to use for years, and security concerns prevented him from using an iPhone for some time.“I get the thing, and they’re all like, ‘Well, Mr. President, for security reasons ... it doesn’t take pictures, you can’t text, the phone doesn’t work ... you can’t play your music on it,’” Obama told “The Tonight Show” host Jimmy Fallon last year when he was allowed to upgrade his then-old BlackBerry. “Basically, it’s like, does your 3-year-old have one of those play phones?”Shortly before he left office, the Obama White House was credited with dramatically upgrading the executive branch’s technology, including the installation of new computers and faster internet."

In a directive distributed to federal prosecutors, Sessions stated that the Justice Department would roll back 2014 guidance issued under the Obama administration that interpreted Title VII, which prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin, to protect trans government employees.“Title VII’s prohibition on sex discrimination encompasses discrimination between men and women,” Sessions said in the memo, which was obtained by BuzzFeed, CNN and USA Today, “but does not encompass discrimination based on gender identity per se, including transgender status.”“This is a conclusion of law, not policy,” Sessions said. The department, he added, will take this new position in all “pending and future matters.”Justice Department spokesman Devin O’Malley doubled down on Sessions’ remarks Thursday. “Unfortunately, the last administration abandoned that fundamental principle, which necessitated today’s action,” he told USA Today. “This department remains committed to protecting the civil and constitutional rights of all individuals, and will continue to enforce the numerous laws that Congress has enacted that prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.”Not surprisingly, LGBTQ rights groups deemed the news an “outright attack” on the trans community, which has already suffered a number of troubling setbacks under President Donald Trump. GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis argued that Sessions had been “working according to his own ideology and not actual justice” when issuing the directive. The attorney general, she added in a statement, “joins President Trump and an administration who are stopping at nothing to strengthen institutional discrimination and walk back the hard-fought progress made by the LGBTQ community.”Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin felt similarly, calling the decision an “appalling assault” in a series of tweets Thursday. In a Thursday statement, the American Civil Liberties Union’s (ACLU) LGBT & HIV Project Director James Esseks called the news “another low point for a Department of Justice.” “This Department of Justice under Jeff Sessions has time and time again made it clear that its explicit agenda is to attack and undermine the civil rights of our most vulnerable communities,” he wrote, “rather than standing up for them as they should be doing.” Still, Esseks remained “confident that the courts will continue to agree and will reject the politically driven decision by Attorney General Sessions.”"
9,IMPACT,Low-Income Pregnant Women Need Help In Indiana -- And This Group Offers It,Alessandra Freitas,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/low-income-pregnant-women-need-help-in-indiana_us_59d474f9e4b0218923e62ec8,Healthier Moms and Babies provides education on prenatal care and much more.,2017-10-05,"Jackie Martinez (left) holding the baby of Nikki Miltons, who she helped at Healthier Moms and Babies in Fort Wayne, Indiana.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59d47995200000fb15084f8a.jpeg?cache=NArq2Yxedg&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As first-time mom-to-be Ashley Crawford made her way into a pregnancy support group meeting in Fort Wayne, Indiana, several months ago, she wasn’t thinking about how the 32-ounce cup of sweetened iced tea she was drinking might affect her health.“I was in my first trimester, and I didn’t know much about nutrition for pregnant women,” she told HuffPost. “I didn’t know how much sugar and sodium there are in drinks like that.”During the group discussion, Crawford, 30, met social worker Jack Martinez, who would end up being her counselor during her pregnancy.“She had this great energy and was really excited to become a mom, but there was a lot she needed to learn about prenatal care and how to have a healthy pregnancy,” Martinez said. “She had every risk factor I could probably check ― she was obese, she was a smoker and she was also carrying twins.”That day was the first time Martinez talked to Crawford about nutrition and how it can affect a pregnancy outcome. Their conversation had an immediate effect ― on her way out, Crawford didn’t hesitate to throw the full drink in the trash can.“After that class I didn’t want to risk my health or my babies’ health,” Crawford said. “I learned a lot about fetal development, what they could feel and hear during every stage of the pregnancy ― it was just amazing.”Educating pregnant women is a huge part of what Martinez does for Healthier Moms and Babies, a nonprofit that started in Allen County, which includes Fort Wayne, in the mid-1990s. The group works with low-income women who are Medicaid recipients “throughout their pregnancies to provide prenatal care,” said Paige Wilkins, the group’s director. The group offers “education on the development of their babies, knowledge of their bodies and help recognizing the signs of preterm labor,” she added.Its services include home visitations, as well as the support group sessions that Crawford attended. The organization is part of a big trend in the state where nonprofits are stepping in to fill a gap in the health care system.“A huge problem in Indiana is that it can be a real challenge for people to find access to care,” said Dr. Marcee Everly, a certified nurse midwife and teacher at the College of Health and Human Services at Indiana State University. “A lot of our rural hospitals don’t provide labor delivery services anymore, so many patients have to travel some distance just to find an OB provider ― and the transportation we have doesn’t make that easier.”According to Everly, local organizations like Healthier Moms and Babies offer the support and accessibility many women need to commit to a healthy pregnancy lifestyle. Even still, risk factors can often complicate outcomes.“I had to quit my job because of the high pelvic pressure caused by the weight I was carrying,” Crawford told HuffPost of her pregnancy. Still, she was able to give birth without any major health issues.“We worked with Ashley, and her blood pressure remained good and she never became gestational diabetic at all,” Martinez said. “She now has two healthy boys that she is raising really well.”However, not everyone has this kind of outcome. One of the biggest problems Healthier Moms confronts is that some women don’t recognize the signs of preterm labor, and by the time they reach the hospital, it can be too late to save the baby or avoid complications, Wilkins said.Dr. Heather Wolfe, a pediatrician who works in Lutheran Children’s Hospital in Fort Wayne, says a lack of information is the main problem.“Many women don’t know the signs of preterm labor,” she told HuffPost. “When it’s very early in the pregnancy, they assume what they’re feeling is normal, and when they realize something is wrong, many don’t have the language to explain to the doctor that this is what can be happening.”The problem is exacerbated because some rural hospitals don’t offer comprehensive labor and delivery care, Everly said.“If the woman is in preterm labor and she goes into a hospital that doesn’t have a NICU, they might give her medication to stop the contractions,” she said. “But if that doesn’t work, she has to be transferred to another hospital while there’s a continuing labor going on that is getting harder to be reversed.”As of 2015, Indiana had an infant mortality rate ― death within the first year of life ― of 7.3 per 1,000 live births. That was higher than the overall U.S. rate of 5.9 deaths per 1,000 live births.The problem is especially acute in some of Indiana’s black communities. “If you look at rates [for] African-American babies ... they are two times more likely to die than white babies in Indiana,” Wilkins said.All of the Healthier Moms clients last year were Medicaid recipients and at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level. There are several factors that contribute to disparate pregnancy outcomes for this group.A 2016 study from the U.S Department of Health and Human Services found that 29.2 percent of pregnant women paying for health services using Medicaid were obese ― the highest rate among the different sources of payment for pregnant women in the U.S. Obese women can have a higher chance of premature birth, as well as other pregnancy risks.Wolfe said that in her experience, the fact that unhealthy food is more affordable and more readily available tends to make it the primary choice for low-income moms ― leading to issues like increased cholesterol and over time, obesity.“You can notice that while during your grocery shopping ― it is more expensive to eat really healthy, particularly for the lower income families,” Wolfe said. “A box of mac and cheese is cheaper compared to all the ingredients you have to buy to make a good, healthy soup.”Smoking is another big risk factor ― and among the state’s Medicaid population, a study found that 30 percent of pregnant women were smokers.For many low-income black women, the problem is a lack of adequate access to prenatal care, Wolfe said. “Our black moms get first trimester prenatal care at a much lower rate,” she said.Healthier Moms is trying to step in where the health care system is failing many of these women. Paige Wilkins, the director of the nonprofit, has been working to expand her organization’s outreach and improve pregnancy outcomes for more moms. In the past year, Healthier Moms provided services to 235 women and welcomed the births of 109 babies under its program. Despite dealing with 343 risk factors, only 8 percent of the newborns had to be admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit.Through Healthier Moms, Wilkins works directly with nurses and social workers like Martinez to teach mothers-to-be how to track fetal development by doing kick counts, for example. The organization also provides guidance on when to call a doctor and how to provide a safe environment for babies. One of the most important classes includes cautioning women about unsafe sleep environments, which is one of the leading causes of infant mortality. One of the main challenges the organization is focusing on tackling is increasing the number of breastfeeding moms in the program, which was at 55 percent last year.Healthier Moms had a budget of about $300,000 last year and has a staff of five, including Wilkins. They take turns visiting homes to make sure the women they’re working with have a safe place to live, are not experiencing any form of domestic abuse, are paying their bills on time and are getting access to enough resources, from clean water to mental health care.In the past year, the group made 825 home visits, and 93 percent of the moms in their program kept their prenatal appointments. “For all the pregnant women who are struggling out there, don’t hesitate to seek help,” new mom Crawford said. “They helped me so much at Healthier Moms and Babies and they will help you too ― no matter what, they have your back.”The group also deals with tragedy ― and provides support for women who lose babies during pregnancy.“Last year we had a mom who lost a baby at about 26 weeks,” Wilkins said. “It was all very hard on her and we continued to work with her to make sure that she had the support she needed to help her cope with that loss, not only emotionally but financially as well.”Wilkins hopes to expand the group’s reach by adding programs to educate the partners of the women it is serving and to amplify its mental health assistance.The nonprofit recently received funding from the Indiana Department of Health to start a Nurse Family Partnership in Allen County. With the new money, eligible mothers will be able to stay in the program until their child’s second birthday instead of only three months after birth, which is the organization’s current limit.“I think collaboration is key” to solving the lack of support for many low-income pregnant women, Wilkins said. “We need to work together.”Martinez agrees. “It’s amazing what you can accomplish just by being there and offering a little bit of support,” she said.

Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama plan to attend a hurricane relief concert at Texas A&M University later this month, following a devastating string of storms that has affected millions across Texas, Florida and the Caribbean.The event, called “Deep from the Heart: The One America Appeal Concert,” will be hosted by the George H.W. Bush Presidential Library and feature performances from musicians including Alabama, The Gatlin Brothers, Lyle Lovett and Cassadee Pope. All funds raised from ticket sales will go to help storm victims.“This catastrophic hurricane season has already caused hundreds of billions of dollars in property damage, displaced millions and destroyed entire communities,” a press release announcing the event said. “As a result, our fellow Americans are facing overwhelming challenges. The staggering, urgent need is simply beyond the capacity of government alone to address.”In a statement, George H.W. Bush said the concert would emphasize that those affected by hurricanes Harvey, Maria and Irma would be taken care of “for the long haul,” saying such effort would continue “even if the path to recovery feels like a road that goes on forever.”“The 43rd president and I, and our distinguished colleagues in this ‘One America Appeal,’ are very grateful to these wonderful performers — some of them old friends, some of them new — for giving their time and talent to help the urgent cause of hurricane recovery in Texas, Florida, and the Caribbean,” the elder Bush said in a statement.All five former presidents released a video last month launching the One America Appeal campaign after Hurricane Harvey devastated parts of Texas, and the initiative has since expanded to include victims of the other two storms.President Donald Trump is unaffiliated with the campaign, but has traveled to Texas, Florida and most recently Puerto Rico after the storms passed. Trump came under fire on Tuesday for throwing paper towels at survivors of Hurricane Maria and saying the storm wasn’t a “real catastrophe” like Hurricane Katrina, even though 3 million residents were without power at the time.The White House on Wednesday asked Congress for an additional $29 billion in aid to help Puerto Rico and other areas recover from the storms, including nearly $13 billion for FEMA.Tickets for the relief concert are available online, and it will take place Oct. 21 at Texas A&M’s Reed Arena, which can hold nearly 13,000 people."
11,ENTERTAINMENT,Willem Dafoe Submits Some Of His Career's Best Work In 'The Florida Project',Matthew Jacobs,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/willem-dafoe-the-florida-project_us_59d4026de4b06226e3f462a2,"The actor discussed his new movie, ageism, playing villains and working with directors like Martin Scorsese and David Lynch.",2017-10-05,"Willem Dafoe and Brooklynn Prince star in ""The Florida Project.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c043a51c0000240079f165.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Willem Dafoe’s résumé is peppered with A-list co-stars ― Gene Hackman, Laura Dern, Tom Cruise, Madonna, Denzel Washington ― but his new movie, “The Florida Project,” pits him opposite show-stopping newcomers. The results yield some of the most dynamic work of Dafoe’s 37-year career.What initially sounds like a gimmick ―director Sean Baker cast non-professional actors as denizens of a shabby motel outside Disney World ― turns into a cinematic gem. Dafoe plays Bobby, the motel’s gruff but compassionate manager, who is used to accommodating strapped boarders living on the fringes of society, à la 6-year-old Moonee (Brooklynn Prince) and her volatile, unemployed mother (Bria Vinaite, discovered by Baker via Instagram). Moonee spends her days making mischief and becoming a lovable foil to Bobby, who doubles as landlord and unlikely father figure. For Dafoe, whose distinctive cheekbones and oceanic eyes give him one of Hollywood’s most eclectic faces, working with novices unstudied in the proverbial craft of acting was a feast. It’s not a stretch to imagine the beguiling man who once played Jesus ― in Martin Scorsese’s “The Last Temptation of Christ” ― becoming a de facto messiah to his younger colleagues. Of course, he wouldn’t see it that way.HuffPost sat down with Dafoe in New York earlier this week. For someone who is best known for portraying villains and weirdos, he was refreshingly smiley. I watched “The Last Temptation of Christ” the other day. Oh, I haven’t seen it in a long time.It’s wild to think about: There you were playing Jesus in a Martin Scorsese movie, less than a decade after you’d been cut from “Heaven’s Gate.”That was one of my most engaging and most challenging and most fun experiences.And to ride that wave as it entered the world to so many protests from Christian fundamentalists.Well, that’s a different thing. But to actually make it, to work with a master filmmaker, with material that he was passionate about, that was rich material, and then to do it for a budget which meant we couldn’t sit in it. You had this master filmmaker, this auteur, great material, but we shot it like a low-budget movie: fast, decisive, exhausting.Yet it was released by a major studio. That movie wouldn’t get made today.No. It probably got made because he gave them another movie. In fact, I know it.The Scorsese way. It might have been “The Color of Money.” Sounds about right.It was bittersweet to see Harry Dean Staton in the movie.Poor Harry Dean. Well, 91. That’s not bad.He had a good run. It was also your first collaboration with Harvey Keitel. You guys seemed to become the primo onscreen villains, probably not by design.For certain people.Right, it’s all relative. Laura Dern recently said your “Wild at Heart” character is the creepiest in cinema history.Maybe. That was a pretty good character.You don’t seem particularly interested in method theory and all that highfalutin talk about craft. In working with non-professional actors, does that make it —Easier?Yeah. Was it a treat to work with non-actors?Yes! Yeah. Yeah. And, you know, some of my favorite performances are by … people. [Laughs] Some of them happen to be actors. I’m always interested in that kind of tension you have when you watch something and you aren’t conscious of a craft — you see people, you don’t see craft. You’re not concentrating on, oh, how brilliant that turn is, or, oh, he did that so wonderfully. You’re thinking, wow, how beautiful people are, or, oh, I never thought that. All the worldly stuff is left out, so you want to disappear into the reality. And of course that’s limited, and it depends on what kind of movie. In some movies, you do want a performance that’s in your face and theatrical. But for something like this, clearly, you want to disappear in the fact that the other actors are a combination of street casting and people that live at where we’re shooting and new actors and children. It’s all mixed, and my job is to fit in, to find my place in that environment, in that ecology.I like that because it forces you to surrender to an alternate reality, and that’s the first condition for pretending. That’s the first condition for making something: that it’s not to service you ― it’s to service something that’s greater than you. I embrace that situation, and I say, “Great.” You have all these different perspectives; you have all these different experiences. I’m good with dealing with 6-year-olds. They’re going to challenge me in a way that one of my contemporaries can’t.What was the first day of shooting like?Ah, well, that’s very particular because I hate first days. I’m always nervous on the first day because it’s always a struggle to know what you’re doing. And when I say “know what you’re doing,” I’m not talking about performance — I’m talking about “what is this, where are we, what are we doing, who’s who, what do I feel?”You have to find naturalism in that unfamiliar chemistry.Yeah. But I will say, one thing that I do remember that’s close to the first day is I did some excursions and some interviews and the normal research to understand that place and also help with character choices, from everything to costume to the way I would say things, my accent, that sort of thing. I did that normal stuff, but I wasn’t necessarily hanging out, for example, with Bria and Brooklynn before I did a scene with them. I remember specifically when I went to their room, which was already dressed and was where they were kind of living, that when I met Bria, all tatted out and green in her hair and pierced and full of attitude, I thought, “She’s not an actress. She can’t be an actress. This is too good. This is too real! Where did they find her?” And then of course Brooklynn was a real firecracker. The combination of the two, I thought, “This is good. I can deal with this in the context of Bobby, the manager of the motel.” And that’s where it starts. Of course, with time, just through playing the scenes, you get close and you have a relationship.The nature of the film is such that much of it feels improvisational. Compared to other movies you’ve done, would you describe the experience that way?Yeah, I think that’s right. Well, I hate to compare because you say that and now I’m running through my catalog to see if there’s exceptions. Never say never, and never say sure, you know? But one thing I hear is that it has a kind of authenticity of behavior that only can happen sometimes with improvisation because there’s an accidental quality to it, an unpolished quality, a flawed, real-life quality to it.As quickly as I say that, I think about the directors you’ve worked with, even the ones who write their own material —Abel Ferrara’s a good example. A lot of his stuff is sometimes very written, but inside of what’s written, there’s lots of improvisation.But not with someone like David Lynch, right?No. He’s very precise. And Wes Anderson, you may do something to prepare or to find something, but he sees the movie before you even arrive.He might as well just hand you a play-by-play.Yeah, which is a beautiful thing. I like it. I like it all ways — that’s my thing.We mentioned that today’s studios would be unwilling to make “Last Temptation of Christ.” I’m thinking about the back half of your résumé, which has a handful of big-budget tentpole projects. Was there a moment when you realized that was the way Hollywood was going and decided to play along? It doesn’t seem like your brand, so to speak.No, I mean, if you’re talking about something like “Spider-Man,” I liked Sam Raimi. It was a good role. It was a double role, and I [liked that there was] action in it, because I love doing physical stuff and I have some facility with that stuff. In fact, I perform from a very physical place, usually. My body is my friend — it’s the motor, it’s the intelligence. But it’s not that calculated. I never think about where Hollywood is going. I try to think about where it is, but it’s case by case. I don’t worry about Hollywood. I worry about what interests me, because it’s got to be specific to me. Otherwise, I won’t be able to contribute in a full way.What do you think of where Hollywood is right now?It depends on where you sit. That’s an impassable question, for me, anyway.But in terms of the roles that are coming across your desk?You know, as I get older, the range is wider. I’m finding a wider range of situations and kinds of roles. There’s always the specter of ageism lurking. I’m not that old, but it’s always in the background. There’s more possibility than ever before.“The Florida Project” opens in New York and Los Angeles on Oct. 6. It expands to additional cities throughout the month."

Devin Funchess has seemed to really embrace the physicality of his routes and getting those extra yards. Does that give you a little bit of enjoyment to see him truck-sticking people?”Newton seemed surprised a woman might actually know something about the game.Newton has yet to apologize to Rodrigue for his comments, but the story has led to the discovery of some social media skeletons in her own closet: at least three racially insensitive tweets she made in 2012 and 2013.Another tweet discusses Dale Earnhardt and uses the term “n***a,” a word that should never be used by anyone who’s not black. After the offensive tweets were circulated, Rodrigue posted one apologizing for them. The Charlotte Observer also posted the statement.The paper’s sports editor Mike Persinger declined to comment to HuffPost, saying the outlet “is working on its own story and that will be the statement.”Meanwhile, many people weren’t impressed by Rodrigue’s apology.Some people didn’t think Rodrigue’s racially insensitive tweets negated Newton’s sexist comments.But there was pushback."

Friday morning in between sessions with clients a colleague called. A teenager at a high school nearby had committed suicide after arriving at school that morning. My heart sank. She informed me that the school had released all of the students for the day and that they’d canceled the football game scheduled that evening. The remainder of the day it looked as though it was business as usual for me. Meeting with clients, picking up my kids from school and ordering in pizza—our Friday night ritual, yet, I couldn’t shake the sadness of the seventeen-year-old girl who ended her life that morning. I carried her around with me wondering how we might have spared her from suffering so intensely. My thoughts drifted to the trauma for the teens entering the building that morning, worried they weren’t fully prepared for a chemistry exam or frustrated about some drama amongst their peers, and then the unimaginable happens, and everyone is shuffled back onto buses and into worried parents’ cars. The faculty, I imagine, remain to deal with the aftermath. Oh, but the family—my heart drops further—how do they go on when their sweet girl is no longer? Still asleep, my five-year-old rushed in on Saturday morning, “Momma, it’s a home day!” Yes, today is a home day (i.e., a non-school day) and with the sun shining brightly through proclaimed black-out curtains I thought of the family who didn’t have the gift of a very typical Saturday. I’ve trained myself in times like these to send love to those hurting in my mind’s eye and to bring myself back into the present moment—the list I need to make for the grocery store, the laundry that must be started, and the endless errands I need to run. Present moment attention helps those of us highly sensitive creatures not to get caught so profoundly in a web of sadness. Dwelling on the news of another’s tragedy is just as unhealthy as ignoring it altogether. Sunday morning as I sit in a driveway, waiting—as mothers endlessly do—for my thirteen-year-old to gather his things from a sleepover I check Facebook. I’ve barely begun the mindless scrolling and then the headline from my local newspaper takes my breath away, “Three Murdered on Mass Street.”Interrupted by my oldest, the one I’m attempting to allow a little more freedom, he hops into the car with bedhead and big news, “Mom, last night was insane. Lil Yachty was seriously like five feet away from me.” He’d gone to Late Night at Allen Fieldhouse the night before, the celebratory kick off for the University of Kansas’s basketball season and they’d brought in one of my son’s favorite rappers to “hype everyone up.” Later, while my son and his buds played X-Box until wee hours of the morning, three kids in their early twenties were murdered after leaving the bars in our sweet little college town. My brain couldn’t fathom the scene. Mass Street, the same street where we spend countless hours at quaint restaurants, shopping at locally owned stores, and hanging out at coffee shops while writing my first book was a crime scene only hours before. For years, I too wandered out of bars on that same street as a college kid, eager to make plans for the afterparty as I imagine they were also until shots were fired and the scattering ensued. The fear, terror and grief others experienced nagged at me. How could we have intervened? How could this happen? I spin out. I’m missing the excitement of my son as he tells the story of his favorite basketball players. Present moment, I think. Be here. Right now. First, pause, send love to those hurting today.Monday morning I groggily make my way into the kitchen to pour the elixir into my favorite coffee cup. My husband, already busy packing lunches for the kids, nods at the tv, “You’re never going to believe what’s on CNN this morning.”I walked into the living room where images of the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas, the same Las Vegas my dad said he and my step-mom are headed to this week, flashed on the screen. Blurred images of a stampede of people fleeing in the dark, beneath it the words scrolled across, “Deadliest Mass Shooting in US History.” At the time it was believed fifty were dead and over two hundred injured. Horrified and aware of the time I started the shower, woke up sleeping children and began the usual routine of getting ready for work and rushing kids off to school. I thought of my son’s excitement to see a performer he loved on Saturday night. I imagined that same level of excitement of all the fans enjoying an outdoor concert of one of their favorite country musicians, and then, in what initially seemed like fireworks to enhance the performance, the utter terror of somehow comprehending the bullets pouring from the sky and penetrating innocent friends and family members without warning. How on earth can we live in a place where this happens? The toll from the teen’s suicide on Friday, the three college-age kids dead from a shooting just a short distance away while I slept, and the largest mass shooting in our country's history settled in. I felt myself shifting from sadness into fear. Without realizing it I unconsciously began creating a mental list of all the things we wouldn’t do or would change in an effort to keep safe. 1. No outdoor concerts. (I recall the outdoor concert I took my son and his friends to this Summer. The joy in their faces as their idols hit the stage). Nope, don’t think about that. We won’t be going anymore. Too unsafe.2. Do my kid’s need to attend private schools so they don’t witness a classmates suicide while in high school? That’s absurd; I know the stats, suicide is rampant, the second leading cause of death among those ages 10-24, suicide doesn’t care what school you attend. I shifted into a place of helplessness and hopelessness. I can’t protect them, those I love most, from tragedy. I shift to Glennon Doyle, my favorite author saying, in a talk while I sat in the front row, “We are going to lose each other.” She too, a yellow canary, a highly sensitive soul couldn’t bear the pain of this life for many years, and she hid out in an eating disorder and substance dependence. She shared in her book, Carry On Warrior, that addiction was a safe place to numb out and protect herself. She recognized, as she sat with a positive pregnancy test, that such self-destructive behaviors had to end. Becoming a mother was her invitation to find a new way of being. She realized, as she sat in one hospital holding her newborn niece on the same day that in another hospital she said goodbye to her beloved grandmother that life is ‘brutiful.” Glennon encourages us to embrace both the beautiful and brutal parts of life. “We can’t have one without the other.”Resistance.My brain fights against this notion as the death toll rises in Vegas. I recall a conversation, not so long ago when I learned of several untimely deaths of people around my age, with my therapist (yes, therapists have therapists!). Nearing forty I was bumping up against my mortality, and I wasn’t too happy about it. At all. Not one part of it. I looked at her, the same way I remember looking at my mom when I was in labor for the first time, my eyes pleading, “I can’t do this. And PS: Why the hell didn’t you tell me it was going to be this painful?” “You know those documentaries about the inhumane treatment of animals?” I say. “I just keep thinking of us, much like all the cows that are crammed up against each other while being herded towards the slaughter area. I feel like we are the cows, all just crammed together waiting to die.” (I know this is morbid and dark, but this is how it felt in the moment). She looked at me, more reasonable, more comfortable with the truth, that yes, in fact, we all are going to die. “What would it be like for you, instead of being trapped in terror, to look at those who are shoulder to shoulder with you and find some comfort that at least we are all in this together.”?Ah, yes. There’s that. I felt some relief as I recalled my favorite quote, “We are all just walking each other home.” Together.Although today is not an ordinary day for many who are suffering, I think the best any of us can do is be present to each other and our lives when we do have the extraordinary gift of a typical day. To extend ourselves to those who are most in need in whatever form that takes for you—a donation of your time, a monetary contribution towards efforts to relieve those suffering in some small way, or simply sending healing energy to those in pain. As I walked past my coffee table on Monday evening, weighted and worried, I saw the title of a book a dear friend sent me, Only Love Today. What would I do right now, this very second if I was only to give love today? My golden retriever, eager for my attention, was my answer. If I focused on love instead of fear I would turn off the news for awhile. Mosley and I took a long walk and as we tiredly made our way up the hill back home, I stopped as at least fifty geese flew by in their hallmark V-shaped formation. I felt a sense of wonder as it seemed the number of geese flying overhead would never end. They poured endlessly, effortlessly from the sky. I heard a little girl down the block excitedly saying, “Daddy, daddy! Do you see all of the birds?” When the last of them had passed Mosley and I found our way back home. My heart was softened. Only love today. Only. Love.

It’s the one thing about country music that’s always been at the center of it. It is community, it’s about community. And so I did know those people in that way, and it just really hit me,’” he said.The country singer told the crowd he was grateful to “put some light in the world.”“Nashville” actor Charles Esten also gave remarks during the vigil. He ended the ceremony by asking the crowd to contribute to the Community Foundation of Middle Tennessee’s Music City Cares Fund, which will give 100 percent of donations to help victims of the attack. Esten then made another touching request. “I also know that we had candles out here tonight, and the wind blew them out,” he said. “Those aren’t the candles that matter, those aren’t the lights that matter. Why don’t you go out and you be the light? You let your light shine to somebody’s life, through your giving, through your acts, through your love because that is something the wind cannot blow out and darkness cannot quench.”"

That’s the lowest percentage yet found in a series of HuffPost/YouGov polls taken over the past two years, often in the wake of tragedy. Thirty-seven percent believe mass shootings are “a fact of life in America today.”Americans who don’t personally own guns are 21 points likelier than those who do to believe that mass shootings can be stopped ― 49 percent to 28 percent. But as is often the case, views are most sharply divided along political lines. Two-thirds of voters who supported Hillary Clinton in last year’s election, but just 28 percent of those who supported Donald Trump, think such shootings are preventable.The vast majority of Americans continue to view gun violence as a serious problem, the survey finds. A modest majority of 53 percent say it’s possible to enact new regulations while preserving the right to bear arms, with fewer than 3 in 10 believing that any regulations pose a threat.The public remains generally in favor of tighter gun control: 49 percent think gun laws should be made stricter, while 30 percent believe they should stay as is and just 10 percent think they should be relaxed. That division has remained relatively stable in HuffPost/YouGov polls since 2015, with support for stricter gun laws hovering between 48 and 55 percent.Many individual gun control policies, such as instituting universal background checks, draw close to universal support in other polling.But just 41 percent of Americans say Congress should take action to reduce mass shootings, the most recent survey finds, while 43 percent believe these events can’t be reduced through legislation.There’s also a close divide on whether passing stricter guns laws is politically feasible, with 37 percent saying that it is and 40 percent saying that it’s currently impossible.Just 15 percent of Americans name gun policies as among the two issues most important to them. That’s up 9 points since September, but still lagging far behind issues like health care and the economy. Those who favor stricter gun laws and those who wish they were less strict are about equally likely to rank the topic among their highest priorities.Use the widget below to further explore the results of the latest HuffPost/YouGov survey, employing the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Oct. 2-3 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

17,POLITICS,The Supreme Court's Gerrymandering Case Is A Debate About Threats To American Democracy,Sam Levine,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/roberts-ginsburg-gerrymandering_us_59d51d8de4b0380b6c99c2da,Chief Justice John Roberts said the court's integrity could be harmed by getting involved in the case. Ruth Bader Ginsburg said there was a greater danger.,2017-10-04,Chief Justice John Roberts expressed concern over the institutional reputation of the Supreme Court during oral arguments in a landmark gerrymandering case on Tuesday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59d51f42200000fb15085175.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Underneath the legalistic debate about standing, standards and statistical analysis during oral arguments in a landmark Wisconsin gerrymandering case at the Supreme Court on Tuesday, there was a deeper debate happening among the justices about guaranteeing confidence in the American democratic system. The court is considering if it is appropriate for the judiciary to step in and strike down electoral maps that go so far to benefit one party that they violate the Constitution. And if the court can step in, the justices are trying to figure out if there is a fair standard they can use to evaluate the maps.As they debated those questions on Tuesday, the justices highlighted a paradox as they confront an ill facing American democracy. On one side, Chief Justice John Roberts argued the court would harm democracy if it inserted itself into the political process and started striking down electoral maps. On the other, Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor argued the court would cause great damage to American confidence in elections if it did not.The case before the Supreme Court deals with the state legislature maps Wisconsin Republicans drew after winning complete control of the state legislature in 2010. Using advanced technology, lawmakers and experts drew the maps in such a way that guaranteed their party’s continued control over the state government for years to come. The maps were so successful that Republicans won 60 of 99 assembly seats in 2012 despite only winning 48.6 percent of the statewide vote. The Supreme Court has never said gerrymandering for partisan gain can be unconstitutional, but Justice Anthony Kennedy, seen as the key swing vote in the case, has written that a standard for striking one down could hypothetically exist.A Supreme Court ruling in favor of the Wisconsin challengers could reshape American politics by requiring lawmakers to draw maps that are more fair and competitive. At oral arguments, Kennedy at least appeared open to setting a standard to determine when gerrymandering goes too far, though it’s difficult to say how he’ll vote.In an extraordinary moment during oral arguments, Roberts interrupted Paul Smith, the lawyer for the 12 Wisconsin voters challenging the election maps, to speak at length about his concern for the reputation of the court. Roberts said if the court decided to set a standard for saying certain cases of gerrymandering are unconstitutional, it would invite a flood of lawsuits to the Supreme Court and weaken the court’s reputation. In Roberts’ view, the average intelligent American would doubt the court was using a fair standard and think it was getting more political.“The intelligent man on the street is going to say that’s a bunch of baloney. It must be because the Supreme Court preferred the Democrats over the Republicans. And that’s going to come out one case after another as these cases are brought in every state,” Roberts said. “And that is going to cause very serious harm to the status and integrity of the decisions of this Court in the eyes of the country.”The exchange highlighted Roberts’ concern with preserving the court’s status and Americans’ faith in the only unelected branch of government. But to some court watchers, the chief justice’s concern was ignoring the reality that many Americans see the court as a political body as is. The public’s perception of the court has also dropped since 2010, according to Gallup polling. “The Court is already viewed as a political court,” Rick Hasen, an election law expert and professor at the University of California, Irvine, wrote in a blog post. “It is likely to be viewed as a partisan court going forward much more, now that all the liberals on the Court were appointed by Democratic presidents and all the conservatives by Republican presidents. This case is not going to do it. It is already done. The Court that decided Shelby County and Citizens United along party/ideological lines is looked at by the intelligent woman (or man) on the street as the product of a highly ideological politicized Court.”Smith said that Roberts’ argument was so narrowly focused on preserving the court’s reputation that the chief justice was missing the broader threat to the country.“If you let this go, if you say this is ― we’re not going to have a judicial remedy for this problem, in 2020 you’re going to have a festival of copycat gerrymandering the likes of which this country has never seen,” he said. “And it may be that you can protect the Court from seeming political, but the country is going to lose faith in democracy big time because voters are going to be like ―­ everywhere are going to be like the voters in Wisconsin and, no, it really doesn’t matter whether I vote.”Smith’s thinking echoed that of Ginsburg and Sotomayor.Ginsburg interrupted Erin Murphy, a lawyer defending Wisconsin’s maps, to ask why the court should protect a system that discouraged people from voting. “I would like to ask you what’s really behind all of this. The precious right to vote, if you can stack a legislature in this way, what incentive is there for a voter to exercise his vote?,” Ginsburg asked. “Isn’t that ― what becomes of the precious right to vote? Would we have that result when the individual citizen says: ‘I have no choice, I’m in this district, and we know how this district is going to come out?’ I mean that’s something that this society should be concerned about.” Sotomayor put the question more succinctly to Murphy, asking: “Could you tell me what the value is to democracy from political gerrymandering? How ― how does that help our system of government?”There are historical roots for Roberts’ concern with electoral integrity. Richard Pildes, a law professor at NYU, compared Roberts’ concern over getting involved in electoral disputes to that of Justice Felix Frankfurter, who objected to the court getting involved in redistricting issues. When the court ultimately did get involved and establish it could have a say in political redistricting issues in the landmark 1962 case Baker v. Carr, Frankfurter warned it would undermine the court’s integrity.“It may well impair the Court’s position as the ultimate organ of ‘the supreme Law of the Land’ in that vast range of legal problems, often strongly entangled in popular feeling, on which this Court must pronounce. The Court’s authority ― possessed of neither the purse nor the sword ― ultimately rests on sustained public confidence in its moral sanction,” Frankfurter wrote in his dissenting opinion in the case. “Such feeling must be nourished by the Court’s complete detachment, in fact and in appearance, from political entanglements and by abstention from injecting itself into the clash of political forces in political settlements.”But Richard Reuben, a law professor at the University of Missouri, said it was “beneath the dignity of the court” for Roberts to suggest the court shouldn’t get involved in redistricting cases. “This is our democracy. To suggest that we need to protect democracy by leaving in place a system that does not further it, that prohibits it from actually happening, to me is ludicrous,” he said. "

The press conference came after a report from NBC News that said Tillerson called Trump a “moron” in July and was approached by Vice President Mike Pence about how to handle disagreements with the president.Trump expressed his displeasure with NBC in a tweet shortly before Tillerson spoke Wednesday: Trump tweeted again after Tillerson’s remarks:Tillerson said NBC “erroneously reported” that Pence had to convince him to stay. He did not deny that he called Trump a “moron.”“I’m not going to deal with petty stuff like that,” Tillerson said, calling NBC’s report “nonsense.”Tillerson used the press conference to praise Trump.“He’s smart,” Tillerson said. “He demands results wherever he goes.”It’s not the first time an official working under Trump has used a public appearance to praise the president. During a visit to Puerto Rico to survey damage from Hurricane Maria, Trump asked Jenniffer González-Colón, the island’s representative to Congress, to repeat “nice things” she had said about Trump in interviews.During that same visit, Trump addressed San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz, whom he had attacked just days before. Trump said she had “come a long way” from her criticism of the federal government’s relief efforts and had “acknowledged what a great job we’ve done.”In July, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions praised Trump even as he admitted the president’s repeated public criticism of him for recusing himself from the Russia investigation was “kind of hurtful.”“Well, it’s kind of hurtful, but the president of the United States is a strong leader,” Sessions told Fox News’ Tucker Carlson.At an event in June, members of Trump’s Cabinet took turns praising him after the president kicked off the meeting by praising himself.Trump has called himself a “great loyalty freak” in the past."

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) questioned Equifax CEO Richard Smith on Wednesday, Oct. 4, 2017, about the ""completely out of whack"" incentives in the credit reporting industry.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59d50405200000f8150850e6.jpeg?cache=xpL5qwBeCk&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) forced former Equifax CEO Richard Smith to admit that the credit reporting agency profits from data breaches in a Capitol Hill hearing on Wednesday.Smith testified before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs about a security breach Equifax disclosed in September that exposed the personal data of more than 145 million Americans to identity theft and fraud. Smith retired after the disclosure, but nonetheless will collect a $90-million payout.Questioning Smith on Wednesday, Warren quoted his previous description of fraud as a “huge opportunity for us.”“Now, Mr. Smith, now that information for about 145 million Americans has been stolen, is fraud more likely now than before that hack?” Warren asked.“Yes, Senator, it is,” Smith replied.“So the breach of your system has actually created more business opportunities for you,” Warren said.Warren went on to highlight how Equifax has already sought to make money off of the September breach. The company offered consumers a year of free credit monitoring, after which the company would begin charging for the service, she noted. ( Equifax at first said consumers who enrolled in the year of free monitoring would have to provide credit card information, allowing the company to automatically charge them for the service once the year was up. But after HuffPost reported on the scheme, the company said it wouldn’t require consumers to submit credit card information.)Warren also pointed out that Lifelock, a credit monitoring company that has increased its business tenfold since the Equifax breach, contracts services to Equifax. As a result, Equifax profits from Lifelock’s work.Smith said nothing to dispute Warren’s characterizations of the company’s business model and its reaction to the security breach.Then Warren went in for the kill.“From 2013 until today, Equifax has disclosed at least four separate hacks in which it compromised sensitive personal data. In those four years, has Equfax’s profit gone up?” Warren asked.“Yes, Senator,” Smith responded.“Yes, it has gone up. In fact, it’s gone up by more than 80 percent over that time,” she said.The result, Warren said, was a company ― and industry ― with little incentive to invest in security measures to protect consumers’ personal data.“Equifax did a terrible job of protecting our data, because they didn’t have a reason to protect our data,” Warren concluded. “The incentives in this industry are completely out of whack.”“Because of this breach, consumers will spend the rest of their lives worrying about identity theft. Small banks and credit unions will have to pay to issue new credit cards. Businesses will lose money to thieves,” Warren added. “But Equifax will be just fine ― heck, it could actually come out ahead. Consumers are trapped. There is no competition, nowhere else for them to go. If we think Equifax does a lousy job protecting our data, we can’t take our data to someone else.”The atmosphere at the hearing was mostly solemn as Smith professed his commitment to rectifying the company’s security lapses.It was not all serious, however. In an attempt to satirize Smith, a prankster sat directly behind Smith in the audience sporting a top hat and 19th-century mustache. The satirist, who was present in every media camera shot of Smith, would twirl his fake mustache and periodically raise a monocle to his eye during the hearing, nodding in agreement as Smith spoke.Equifax is one of three major companies, along with Experian and TransUnion, that track the credit histories of consumers who take out loans or purchase a credit card, and use the data to compile credit “scores” that they sell to lenders assessing the creditworthiness of borrowers. The companies are obligated to provide consumers with one free credit report a year, but they have routinely been caught snookering consumers into paying for reports that they initially present as “free.”Given the inherent accountability problems in a consolidated industry where consumers have little recourse against wrongdoing, Warren and other consumer advocates favor dramatic new regulations. On Sep. 15, Warren and Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) introduced the Freedom from Equifax Exploitation Act, which would create a standard, federal process for consumers to freeze their credit files and bar companies from profiting off data breaches. The bill has 10 co-sponsors, all members of the Senate Democratic Caucus."

Once the officers realized that they wrongfully identified Blake, they let him go. The encounter left Blake with cuts and bruises. “In my mind there’s probably a race factor involved, but no matter what, there’s no reason for anybody to do that to anybody,” Blake, who is black, told the New York Daily News at the time. “You’d think they could say, ‘Hey, we want to talk to you. We are looking into something.’ I was just standing there. I wasn’t running. It’s not even close [to being OK]. It’s blatantly unnecessary.”In a recent interview, Frascatore ― who was suspended and later placed on desk duty after the incident, per ESPN ― told the New York Post that given the information he had, his decision to tackle Blake “was the right call.”“I have a family to go home to. I’m on a crowded sidewalk, with a possibly armed suspect in the middle of 42nd Street,’’ said the officer, who is white. “You have to take control of the situation. I can’t just be pulling out my gun.”Frascatore told the Post that Blake’s book, which was released in June, made him “very angry and upset while reading it.”The lawsuit states that “Blake’s defamatory statements about Officer Frascatore were circulated to millions of readers and viewers in print, on-line, and through mobile and social media.” In addition to Blake, the city of New York, the NYPD, the director of the department’s civilian complaint review board and HarperCollins, the book’s publishing house, are named as defendants. The lawsuit claims that the parties paint Frascatore as “a racist and a goon.” Frascatore also claims that a police watchdog group illegally leaked his disciplinary records from before the incident, showing his history of using excessive force. The suit says that “this characterization could not be farther from the truth, this public perception has not only led to his family fleeing their home in fear as a result of public threats to their safety, it has ruined a good man’s career, name and reputation.”Frascatore is seeking $75,000 in damages for emotional distress and slander.

But after Donald Trump’s personal attorney, Marc Kasowitz, intervened, the investigation was dropped within months, according to a report from ProPublica, The New Yorker and WNYC published on Wednesday.The president’s eldest children were being investigated for allegations they used false information to lure prospective buyers at the Trump SoHo, a hotel and condominium development. Prosecutors were probing whether their actions violated the Martin Act, a New York law banning false statements about real estate sales, and indictment “seemed like a real possibility,” according to the report.A lawsuit filed by condo buyers was settled in 2011, The New York Times reported, but the DA’s criminal investigation continued. The settlement forbade lawsuit plaintiffs from cooperating with the DA’s probe.Kasowitz joined the case in the spring of 2012. He went to Vance’s office that May to argue that any inflated claims made by the Trumps didn’t amount to criminal misconduct. Three months later, Vance told his office to drop the investigation, according to the report, which cited 20 sources familiar with the investigation, court records and other public documents. Earlier in 2012, Kasowitz donated $25,000 to Vance’s re-election campaign, the report says. Vance reportedly returned the donation just before his meeting with Kasowitz.“I did not at the time believe beyond a reasonable doubt that a crime had been committed,” Vance told reporters for Wednesday’s article. “I had to make a call and I made the call, and I think I made the right call.” Kasowitz “had no influence, and his contributions had no influence whatsoever on my decision-making in the case.”Kasowitz contended he’s “never made a contribution to anyone’s campaign, including Cy Vance’s, as a ‘quid-pro-quo’ for anything.”Months after the DA dropped the investigation, Kasowitz threw Vance a fundraiser and personally donated almost $32,000, according to the report. He hosted another one the following year and raised an additional $18,000. Vance said he now plans to give back the contributions.“This was a two-year investigation that never produced sufficient evidence to support a criminal prosecution,“ Joan Vollero, Vance’s director of communications, told HuffPost in a statement. “During the investigation, the luxury apartment purchasers reversed course and took the position that the sellers had not committed any crime against them. No outside attorney influenced any decision in this matter.”A spokesman for Vance’s campaign denied the DA was swayed by campaign contributions. “Contributions have never influenced Cy Vance’s work and never will,” the spokesman said in a statement. “Every contribution is vetted through a rigorous process, accepted when appropriate, and returned when flagged. That’s exactly what happened in this instance. Had Mr. Kasowitz had any influence over the matter, his 2013 contribution would have been flagged and returned.”HuffPost’s requests for comment from the White House, Kasowitz and the Trump Organization weren’t returned.

Tim Murphy inadvertently exposed the hypocrisy of the anti-choice movement.,2017-10-04,"Representative Tim Murphy (R-Pa.), who frequently supports anti-abortion legislation, reportedly asked his mistress to have an abortion back in January. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59d4e00d200000fb15085041.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On Tuesday, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that Tim Murphy (R-Pa.), had urged the woman he was having an affair with to abort her pregnancy during what turned out to be an “unfounded pregnancy scare” in January. On the same day the report was published, Murphy voted for legislation that would ban abortion after 20 weeks. In fact, Murphy has a history of supporting anti-abortion legislation, from bolstering efforts to defund Planned Parenthood, to voting to grant fetuses protection under the 14th amendment. This particular scandal is an important reminder that despite the emphasis put on “protecting the unborn,” the rhetoric of the “pro-life” movement is largely just that. At its core, the anti-abortion movement is less about protecting fetuses, and more about legislating and controlling women’s sexual and reproductive health. Murphy’s affair with Pittsburgh-based forensic psychologist Shannon Edwards was made public last month when her husband filed for divorce. In a text message obtained by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Edwards lambasted Murphy for his anti-abortion rhetoric after he pressured her to go through the procedure when he thought she was pregnant with his child. ″[Y]ou have zero issue posting your pro-life stance all over the place when you had no issue asking me to abort our unborn child just last week when we thought that was one of the options,” she wrote to him on January 25.Edwards seems to have been responding to a Facebook post on Murphy’s official page from January 24, in which he’d written that, “it is a tragic shame that America is leading the world in discarding the disregarding the most vulnerable.” The purpose of this particular post was to tout H.R. 7, a bill that would permanently ban any federal funding for abortion care, as well as any reimbursements for insurance plans that cover the procedure. (Read the full post below.) Murphy reportedly responded to Edwards’ text saying that he didn’t write any anti-abortion Facebook posts personally (apparently his staff members did), and that he “read them and winced.”However, just two days later, on Jan. 27, Murphy released a statement of support for the 44th annual March for Life in Washington, D.C.Murphy’s public persona as a selfless advocate for the unborn is typical for members of the anti-abortion right. But what he said behind closed doors to a woman with whom he had a sexual relationship is certainly a more accurate depiction of the anti-abortion movement ― a movement fraught with general disdain for women’s sexual empowerment; one that uses “pro-life” rhetoric in public spaces to drum up support for insidious anti-choice legislation that puts women’s lives in danger.There is often a glaring gap in anti-abortion legislators’ assertions that they are protecting women and future children, and their subsequent lack of advocacy for women and children who need government resources and support the most. Murphy is no exception. He supported the massive failure that was President Trump’s American Health Care Act, which would have had serious consequences for welfare-dependent children. He has also voted against reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, and does not support same-sex marriage or stronger punishment for homophobic hate crimes. And on Tuesday, House members (including Murphy) passed the 20-week abortion ban legislation to “facilitate a culture of life,” even though, as HuffPost’s Laura Bassett pointed out, they had actually “just missed a deadline to reauthorize the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which helped states provide insurance coverage to 9 million children in low-income families.”There is also a long history of anti-choice conservatives depending on reproductive health care access in their own lives only to turn around and try to restrict it for others ― thus, like Murphy, positioning themselves as arbiters of what other people get to do with their bodies. (Norma McCorvey, also known as Jane Roe in the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court case that legalized abortion in the U.S., went on to become an outspoken advocate against the procedure and joined the ranks of some of the most extreme anti-abortion movements in the country.) “We will once again be a nation committed to honoring life from the moment of conception and ensuring American taxpayer dollars are never spent to end a life before it even begins,” Murphy, or his staff, wrote on Facebook in January. Apparently they forgot to include the caveat that he only supports this as long as it’s convenient for him. "

The common thread is that all of them have experienced loss in some way, and all of them are looking for a way in which to process that grief in a healthy and effective way.What is grief counseling?Grief counseling is a therapeutic exercise with a distinct goal – helping you come to a healthy “resolution” to your loss. Whether that loss is the death of a loved one or a traumatic change in life, like a divorce or the loss of a job, your grief counselor is there to help guide your grief – not stifle it. Grief is the natural reaction to loss, and the feelings that come along with it – those of sadness, yearning, guilt, regret and anger – and it’s imperative that you feel them. Talk therapy, as I call it, not only allows you to harness and process these feelings, it also helps you envision and forge a new life – one with an identity and trajectory that is accepting of the loss.So why a grief counselor? The bottom line is that grieving alone isn’t healthy. The ways in which you cope with grief could be delaying – or even preventing – the healing process. For example, common coping mechanisms, like “staying strong,” “keeping busy,” and “replacing the loss” don’t allow you to really feel the void in your life. Feeling is vital to healing, and that’s exactly what talk therapy is all about.What to expectRecently, I met with several first-time counseling seekers in one afternoon. As part of National Suicide Prevention Week, I offered free grief counseling sessions to anyone in need at a local bookstore. Everyone who attended these sessions had a couple commonalities: all had experienced loss, and all were new to grief counseling. The unknown can be intimidating (or let’s be honest – scary), so I think it’s important for anyone considering talk therapy to know what to expect.In your first session, you’ll share the details of your loss. Once we have a mutual understanding of the circumstances and effects of the loss, we’ll explore the grieving process together, realizing that it is unique for every individual. The bottom line is that getting help is a sign of strength, and I make sure that every one of my clients understands this.In subsequent sessions, we explore the myriad emotions of grief in complete honesty. These include those feelings of guilt, blame, shame and anger that you may be hesitant to share. We’ll work through the principle that grief is cumulative, and all other losses in your life are inexorably connected to this one. It’s important to understand how and if you grieved these losses. I’ll ask you to think about how your parents handled loss, what you were taught to believe about loss, and what you believe now.The realizationThe thing is, grief recovery isn’t just about the bereavement that’s staring you in the face when you wake up in the morning. It’s about a lifetime of losses buried over time that have culminated in the feelings of sadness and hopelessness triggered by your current loss. Developing and honing the ability to let go of cumulative grief is the only way to recover in a healthy way.

But we are prepared, and in no case will it be stopped,” she said.Catalan President Carles Puigdemont earlier said he would ask the region’s parliament to declare independence following the poll, which Spain’s government and constitutional court say was illegal and in which only a minority of Catalans voted.“This will probably finish once we get all the votes in from abroad at the end of the week and therefore we shall probably act over the weekend or early next week,” he told the BBC in remarks published on Wednesday.In an interview with German newspaper Bild, Puigdemont said he already felt like “a president of a free country where millions of people have made an important decision.”He said the Madrid government’s refusal to negotiate had left Catalonia “no other way” than to declare independence and accused it of authoritarianism.“The Spanish government is letting political opponents be arrested, it is influencing media and blocking Internet sites. We are under observation day and night,” Puigdemont said.“What is that other than an authoritarian state?”Spain was only restored to democracy following the death in 1975 of dictator Francisco Franco, under whom the Catalan language and traditions were suppressed.The constitutional crisis in Spain, the euro zone’s fourth-biggest economy, has shaken the common currency and hit Spanish stocks and bonds, sharply raising Madrid’s borrowing costs.The cost of insuring against potential losses on Spanish bank debt and Spanish, Italian and Portuguese sovereign debt has also jumped, suggesting an impact on the wider euro zone.Bank stocks were hit especially hard as the Ibex stock index , fell below 10,000 points on Wednesday for the first time since March 2015. In a sign of the nervous public mood, Catalonia’s biggest bank, Caixabank, and Spain’s economy minister had earlier sought to assure bank customers that their deposits were safe.Influential Catalan business lobby Cercle d’Economia said it was extremely worried by the prospect of Catalonia declaring independence and called for both sides to start talks.“Such a declaration would plunge the country into an extraordinarily complex situation with unknown, but very serious consequences,” the group said in a statement.EVENING STATEMENTPuigdemont’s comments appeared after Spain’s King Felipe VI accused secessionist leaders on Tuesday of shattering democratic principles and dividing Catalan society, as tens of thousands protested against a violent police crackdown on Sunday’s vote.The Catalan leader is due to make a statement at 9 p.m. (1900 GMT) on Wednesday.Spain has been rocked by the Catalan vote and the Spanish police response to it, which saw batons and rubber bullets used to prevent people voting. Hundreds were injured, in scenes that brought international condemnation.Catalans came out onto the streets on Tuesday to condemn the police action, shutting down traffic, public transport and businesses, and stoking fears about intensifying unrest in a region that makes up one-fifth of the Spanish economy.Road closures related to the protests briefly halted production at Volkswagen’s Catalonia plant. Stoppages also affected production at Nestle’s instant coffee plant in Girona.“As a businessman, as a Spaniard and as a person, I am very worried and I am scared by what’s going on (in Catalonia),” said Juan Roig, chairman of Spain’s biggest food retailer Mercadona.“IRRESPONSIBLE BEHAVIOUR”Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, a conservative who has taken a hard line on Catalan independence faces a huge challenge to see off the issue without further unrest and potential damage to his minority government.Pro-independence parties which control the regional government staged the referendum in defiance of a Constitutional Court ruling that the vote violated Spain’s 1978 constitution, which states the country is indivisible.Catalonia has its own language and culture and a political movement for secession that has strengthened in recent years.Participants in Sunday’s ballot ― only about 43 percent of eligible voters ― opted overwhelmingly for independence, a result that was expected since residents who favor remaining part of Spain mainly boycotted the referendum.Outside Catalonia, Spaniards mostly hold strong views against its independence drive. In his televised address, the king said the “irresponsible behavior” of the Catalan leaders had undermined social harmony in the region.“Today Catalan society is fractured and in conflict,” he said. “They (the Catalan leaders) have infringed the system of legally approved rules with their decisions, showing an unacceptable disloyalty towards the powers of the state.”The king said the crown was strongly committed to the Spanish constitution and to democracy, and underlined his commitment to the unity and permanence of Spain. He had earlier met Rajoy to discuss the situation in Catalonia.Opinion polls conducted before the vote suggested a minority of around 40 percent of residents in the region backed independence. But a majority wanted a referendum to be held, and the violent police crackdown angered Catalans across the divide.(Additional reporting by Adrian Croft and Julien Toyer in Madrid and Michael Nienaber in Berlin; Writing by Mark Bendeich and Sonya Dowsett; Editing by Julien Toyer and Catherine Evans)"

I was sitting in my local library when an employee tapped me on the shoulder, and asked in hush-hush please speak quietly in the library voice, “Darryl, do you know that in a few minutes there will be a presentation by the Dreamers?” I could have had what turned out to be a memorable and touching experience earlier. I had missed several opportunities before to attend panel discussions featuring young people who have status through the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. But life is life. I always had additional work and other chores or there was another unexpected family crisis.  I live in New Mexico, a state with a high percentage of undocumented immigrants from Mexico. I was aware of the young people called Dreamers, the undocumented sons and daughters of undocumented immigrants, but who are authorized to live and work in the U.S. without fear of deportation because of an executive order signed by President Obama in 2012. There are roughly 800,000 Dreamers in the USA. Most of them arrived in the USA before age 5. They have no experience, much less memory of living in a country other than in the USA. I was aware of these basic gathered from newspapers. The news that Donald Trump was ending DACA, creating controversy and political maneuvering in Washington and fear and anxiety among families, had me concerned. Many have until Oct. 5 to renew their status if they want to stay longer.Yet, like many native-born Americans, I lacked direct or intimate contact with my local immigrant community. I assumed that the “immigrant community” was a simple, or visible, social marker. It is those kinds of easy assumptions, however, that lead to bias. It is easy to assume the immigrant community must consist of a few people that you never see or do not know, or that the DACA program affects “others.”The Dreamer event at my library had only been scheduled a few days beforehand. Democratic U.S. Rep. Ben Ray Lujan was there too. Lujan is a familiar New Mexico political figure. He recently said, “Since 2012, the 9,000 Dreamers in New Mexico have not had to live in fear of deportation. I will oppose any attempt by the Trump administration to end DACA. Tearing families apart to achieve a political end does not reflect American values and will not solve our immigration problems.”I had expected a mere handful of attendees. The meeting was a “pop up” event, but soon the room filled with sparkling young faces, who in my 50-year-old mind’s eye were kids. The sight of them, proudly telling their stories, brought home for me in an immediate way that the statistics, 800,000 Dreamers in the US, and 9,000 in New Mexico, tallied the anxieties of vulnerable youths at a sensitive age. The majority in the room were still adolescents. Adolescence is a challenging experience regardless. Adults usually respond with sympathy to the tumultuous phase. For Dreamers, a challenging young adulthood has a new level of meaning. “President Trump has tweeted that Dreamers shouldn’t worry,” Lujan told the attendees. “But we don’t believe him.” I think Lujan’s skepticism is justified when I see Trump’s willingness to display braggadocio or spread false information during his tweetstorms.  The success of DACA is high stakes. We need to pass a clean DREAM Act that allows these young Americans the opportunity to continue the lives they have built in this country. That was evident, as row by row, the youths in the room told their stories. Some were high school students now frightened that Trump and his deportation machine would separate them from their parents. Some talked about being ripped from the only home they have ever known as they navigated first jobs, first career choices, or first dates. The college students included a 17-year-old wunderkind who was already a junior and studying business management with a high-powered summer internship lined up at an oil firm in Texas. Would she be able to go?Who would not sympathize with the young mothers in their twenties? Would they be separated from their newborns? One young mother was married to a man who was also a Dreamer. She knew that she remained eligible to apply for a residency extension, but her husband’s DACA protections expired next year and he would not be able to reapply. Should she prepare to become head of a broken household?How many Dreamers in the room do you think had their US residency jeopardized by individual misconduct, misdemeanors, or felonies? None. In order to be eligible, Dreamers had to have a spotless criminal record, and (at minimum) be enrolled in high school.No wonder Congressman Lujan joked, “Everybody in Washington wants a photograph with a Dreamer, even ones that don’t support you.” It’s hard not to be impressed by the Dreamers’ maturity. So many are high academic achievers. They have grown up knowing that they had to be “good kids” and met the challenge by becoming great ones. I am encouraged though. Lujan said he was optimistic that Democrats and Republicans in Washington could work out an agreement restoring DACA protections that Trump could sign.DACA is a program at the heart of this nation’s immigrant history. Yet today, Trump and his party are willing to play politics with the fates of families, children and adolescents. That’s unconscionable. Restoring DACA will also restore America’s conscience.Darryl Lorenzo Wellington is a communications fellow for the Center for Community Change."
28,POLITICS,How Can Progressives Succeed In Trump Country? Ask Tom Perriello.,Jason Cherkis,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tom-perriello-candidate-confessional-interview_us_59d5002fe4b04b9f9206d2a7,The former Virginia congressman can wow journalists. But can he succeed within his own party?,2017-10-04,"Tom Perriello addresses a forum with fellow Virginia gubernatorial candidate Ralph Northam on May 2, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59d52f552d00009c17308ab0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― There is a moment during this week’s “Candidate Confessional” podcast interview with former Rep. Tom Perriello (D-Va.) in which I drop my journalistic objectivity.Perriello is talking about corporate monopolies or automation or how craft beer can resurrect the Rust Belt, and when he is done, I just kind of lose it. I lean into the microphone and blurt: I would vote for you!Those weren’t my exact words. It turns out I was a lot more inarticulate than I remembered. I do know that I was embarrassed enough to beg our podcast producer to edit out my exclamation. And if I had more gravitas or a better job title than “podcast co-host,” maybe the producer wouldn’t have forgotten my request ― because you can hear this awkward blurt at around the 45:45 mark.Here’s what I actually said in response to Perriello’s eloquent policy monologue: “I thought. I mean. Yeah. That. I would have voted. I mean that’s convincing there.”Thankfully, my podcast co-host and boss at the time, Sam Stein, talked over me (not an unusual event). But in my defense, there is good reason for this swooning, and other journalists and commentators have fallen hard for Perriello too.Here was a politician who talked policy in a way that felt lived, rather than vetted by an army of consultants or inspired by skimming a few headlines from Jacobin. Perriello’s policies seemed formed by talking to voters from all corners of the country. He is actually interesting. He’s our guy. This is the one. The future.He’s also a loser. And journalists love losers (most of us are socially awkward losers ourselves). There’s a reason this is Perriello’s second appearance on “Candidate Confessional,” a show devoted to losing. He keeps coming up short on Election Day.After his upset win in 2008 in a congressional district that had been essentially owned by Republicans for years, Perriello gained notice for sticking with his progressive ideas in the face of often threatening opposition. We talked to him about his difficulties and defeat in 2010 during our previous season of “Candidate Confessional.”Perriello, who has a long resume that includes years of peacekeeping and human rights work in West Africa, went on to join the Obama administration, where he served as a special envoy for the Great Lakes region of Africa. He hadn’t thought much about seeking elected office again until Donald Trump’s victory: He called election night a “conversion experience.”Deciding to run for governor of Virginia, Perriello jumped in late to the Democratic primary, where he faced Ralph Northam, the state’s lieutenant governor. Northam had already picked up just about every meaningful endorsement, and in June, Perriello lost the primary to him.Perriello did not do well in the Democratic strongholds of northern Virginia and Richmond. But his progressive ideas did win over the more rural parts of the state. He isn’t shy in his feelings about Trump nor in the idea that his approach to Trump voters should help shape the Democratic Party going into the midterm elections next year and the presidential race in 2020.“It was very important for Democrats not to just address Trump, but the forces that gave rise to Trump in the first place,” he told us early in the podcast. “Because it’s very important to understand he’s not a leader. He’s just not. He’s a manipulator and rider of trends.”In other words, there are opportunities for Democrats to control the debate and capture disenfranchised voters, whether they live in cities or in rural enclaves. We asked Perriello about whether racism or economic despair drove Americans to vote for Trump. He didn’t think we had to choose.“These two things have always gone hand in hand and reinforced each other,” he said. “And Trump understood that and was able to play on that trend. So if [Democrats] don’t admit the structural and overt racism part, we’re not doing our jobs as progressives. But if we then get reductionist and say, therefore, all of these voters out there are just about racism and there is no economic problem, we are losing touch not just with Trump voters, but actually with the vast majority of our own coalition that is struggling economically.”Perriello said Trump used racism far more effectively in white suburbs than he did in rural communities. He also noted that rural voters were more progressive on issues like corporate monopolies than one might realize.“We talked a lot about monopoly in this race, because basically, if you looked at the Clinton recovery in the ’90s, 73 percent of new businesses were created in small and medium-sized towns,” Perriello said. “If you look at this recent recovery, 80 percent plus was in the big cities ― zero percent in small towns and counties.”Still, Perriello continued, the voters from cities and small towns had a lot in common. Both wanted to see more investment in trade schools. Both wanted to see criminal justice reform happen and mental health services improve. But some of these interests just aren’t pushed by big party donors, he said. Too often, these kinds of issues can be ignored because of gerrymandering, voter suppression and the sway of donor cash.And it’s still hard to convince voters who see all this to go out and vote. “Part of what makes someone not bother to vote is that they think the system is rigged and corrupt, and they’re right,” Perriello said.Listen to the full interview at the top of this story.“Candidate Confessional” is produced by Zach Young.

We are at the last stage. If we get the results, Antalya’s tourism will gain big momentum. We will start discussions at an international level after the excavations.”Carol Myers, creator of the non-profit St. Nicholas Center, which provides information on the saint, says people shouldn’t be so sure.“I’d say the speculation is very premature,” she told HuffPost by email on Wednesday. “If relics are found, they would need to be dated and examined by international experts. The Turks, of course, are very interested in promoting tourism. I’d be very reluctant to jump to any conclusions.”St. Nicholas’ real-life acts of generosity, particularly to children, helped inspire the red and white-suited figure known as Santa Claus who has become a worldwide symbol for Christmas and holiday festivity.The popular saint was born in the third century in the village of Patara, to wealthy parents who taught him Christian beliefs and values before their untimely deaths left him orphaned, according to the St. Nicholas Center.Wanting to live a life of piety, he surrendered his wealth to the needy and dedicated his life to serving God while becoming the Bishop of Myra."

We will start discussions at an international level after the excavations.”Carol Myers, creator of the non-profit St. Nicholas Center, which provides information on the saint, says people shouldn’t be so sure.“I’d say the speculation is very premature,” she told HuffPost by email on Wednesday. “If relics are found, they would need to be dated and examined by international experts. The Turks, of course, are very interested in promoting tourism. I’d be very reluctant to jump to any conclusions.”St. Nicholas’ real-life acts of generosity, particularly to children, helped inspire the red and white-suited figure known as Santa Claus who has become a worldwide symbol for Christmas and holiday festivity.The popular saint was born in the third century in the village of Patara, to wealthy parents who taught him Christian beliefs and values before their untimely deaths left him orphaned, according to the St. Nicholas Center.Wanting to live a life of piety, he surrendered his wealth to the needy and dedicated his life to serving God while becoming the Bishop of Myra."
31,POLITICS,Powerful Senate Committee Concludes Russia Tried To Sow Chaos In 2016 Elections,Jessica Schulberg and Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senate-committee-intelligence-assessment-russia-trump-election_us_59d5076fe4b04b9f9206df41,The committee has reached no conclusion about whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia.,2017-10-04,"Senate Intelligence Committee vice chairman Sen. Mark Warner and chairman Sen. Richard Burr listen as U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions testifies before a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on June 13, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59d514a6200000fb15085143.jpeg?cache=GGwoOc3yBo&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The Senate Intelligence Committee endorsed the findings of a January intelligence assessment that accused Russia of interfering in last year’s presidential election to help President Donald Trump defeat his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. After interviewing all members of the intelligence community who helped draft the assessment and reviewing thousands of pages of classified documents, there is a “general consensus” that members and staff “trust the conclusions” of the intelligence community’s assessment, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) said at the beginning of the Wednesday press conference. Burr later cast doubt on whether he backed all of the findings in the intelligence assessment. The assessment focused on “Russian involvement in the election process,” the chairman said in response to a question. “We have not come to any determination on collusion or Russia’s preference,” he added.The declassified version of the January intelligence assessment ― which includes analysis from the CIA, FBI, National Security Agency and Office of the Director of National Intelligence ― does not touch on the issue of collusion. But it does make clear that the intelligence community believed Russia wanted Trump to become president. “Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump,” the declassified version of the assessment states.A spokeswoman for Burr declined to clarify the chairman’s remarks.The Senate committee began its investigation into Russian election interference in January and has now interviewed more than 100 people and reviewed over 100,000 pages of documents, Burr said. At the outset of the investigation, the panel planned to focus on reviewing the intelligence community’s findings, determining whether there was evidence of either presidential campaign colluding with Russia, and assessing ongoing Russian measures to influence political campaigns. The Senate committee is still investigating the issue of collusion, Burr said, declining to share even initial findings on that topic. That admission is likely to anger Trump, who has repeatedly denied that his campaign worked with Russia, questioned whether Russia interfered in the election at all, and has said it is “time to move forward” on the Russia issue. Russian actors were involved in three different active measures during the campaign, according to Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner (D-Va.). Those included hacking political entities and advisers and disseminating hacked materials, attempting to “test the vulnerabilities of 21 state electoral systems,” and using social media platforms to engage in information campaigns, Warner said. (At least three of those 21 states dispute that their electoral systems were targeted.) Russians used social media to influence the election through paid advertisements and the creation of fake accounts to force certain preferred stories to trend to “sow chaos and division in our country,” he added.Burr noted emphatically that the attempts to penetrate state electoral systems were unsuccessful and “did not in any way, shape or form alter” vote totals.He also said the committee’s investigation has “expanded slightly” since January as witnesses and documents generated new leads. He declined to set a deadline for the conclusion of the investigation but said it is important to share information with the public before primary races for the 2018 elections begin. Now nine months into the Russia probe, Senate Intelligence Committee members say there is no sign that the investigation is close to completion. “We’re months and months into this, and we keep finding plenty of more stuff to look into,” Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) told CNN.The committee has scheduled 25 additional interviews this month, Burr said — but they have been unable to get in touch with Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence agent who wrote a controversial dossier containing salacious allegations about Trump and his campaign staff’s interactions with Russian officials.The House Intelligence and Senate Judiciary committees are conducting their own Russia probes alongside the Senate panel. There is also a separate investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller, a former FBI director. Lately, the congressional investigations have focused on how the Internet Research Agency, a Russian company that engages in information warfare on behalf of private and government actors, attempted to influence American public opinion during the 2016 presidential election through online platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Google.On Monday, Facebook turned over 3,000 Russia-linked election ads to the committee. Burr told Reuters on Wednesday that those ads targeted states other than Michigan and Wisconsin, the two states initially listed in media reports. NBC’s Kasie Hunt reported that Alabama and Mississippi were also targeted with Facebook ads.The Internet Research Agency is reportedly behind the 3,000 ads uncovered by Facebook that sought to capitalize on existing political and social issues that divide Americans. These included amplifying the anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant messages already prevalent in conservative political circles. The agency is also reported to have created fake accounts imitating African-Americans and American Muslims as part of a disinformation campaign. When asked whether the public will see the advertisements at issue, Burr explained that the committee never discloses documents it receives as part of an investigation. He said he did not mind if the companies disclosed those ads themselves. Warner added, “At the end of the day, I think it’s important that the public sees these ads.”Warner stated that he was initially dissatisfied with social media companies’ reactions to the investigation and the issue of foreign interference. But he now believes that they understand the importance of the issue and have complied with every request from the committee, he said. However, he added, “Their actions need to match their public statements.”Warner and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) are working to develop legislation to require online platforms like Facebook, Google and Twitter to publicly disclose information related to political advertising purchased on their sites. It is already illegal for foreigners to spend money on explicit electoral messages, whether online or offline, but online advertisements on platforms like Facebook and Twitter are not required to carry the same disclaimers as television or newspaper ads noting the ad buyer. In September, Facebook sought to get ahead of legislative or agency regulations by announcing a new policy to require disclosure of ad buyers."

A new report from the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental organization, looked at data from U.S. government databases and other sources on renewables and energy efficiency from 2016 and the first half of 2017. It found that the U.S. made record-breaking progress in several areas, from increasing solar and wind power capacity and generation to reducing carbon pollution and greenhouse gases.Some of the historic firsts in renewable energy in the past year included adding more than 14 gigawatts of solar capacity in 2016 ― almost double the record-breaking amount in 2015. And for the first time on record in 2017, solar and wind provided over 10 percent of all electricity power for a single month in the U.S. in both March and April. In some regions, such as California and Texas, wind and solar at times met more than 50 percent of total energy demand.The country also added its first offshore wind farm last year off of Rhode Island’s Block Island, though the U.S. still trails behind Europe in the industry, which has been active there for years. President Donald Trump has made several moves to reverse the country’s progress on climate and clean energy, from pulling the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord to signing executive orders to roll back the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan and lift its ban on leasing federal land for coal development.But the NRDC and a slew of other environmental and renewable power advocates remain confident that the U.S. will continue to make strides on clean energy in the coming years, largely thanks to the actions of states, cities and businesses. “Despite changes at federal level in November 2016, the clean energy growth and reduction in carbon pollution and greenhouse gases is still continuing,” report author Amanda Levin told HuffPost. “Not only was it the best year on record ― 2017 and 2018 are still looking like strong years.”“But if the government sends the wrong market signals ― promoting coal use or natural gas over renewables or energy efficiency,” Levin added, “it makes it hard to continue to build energy-efficient buildings or renewable sources of power to reach long-term climate goals.” One reason Levin is confident about the future of U.S. clean energy production despite Trump’s efforts is that certain existing public policies already extend beyond the president’s first term. For instance, a solar energy investment tax credit remains in place until 2021. And the cost of solar installations have continually decreased in recent years. Not only is clean energy deployment seen as an environmentally-sound move, but it is an increasingly attractive economic option for utilities, businesses and consumers.  The NRDC is also encouraged by the leadership of states and cities on clean energy, Levin said. After Trump pulled out of the Paris climate accord, more than 1,400 mayors signed a resolution committing to clean energy initiatives. States have also stepped up ― New York and California, for instance, passed standards to get 50 percent of electricity from renewables by 2030. But Trump administration efforts to curb clean energy innovation remain a major concern for advocates and former officials, including a bipartisan group who previously led the Department of Energy’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), which works to advance the development of clean energy.“We are unified that cuts of this magnitude in the proposed budget will do serious harm to this office’s critical work and America’s energy future,” wrote the previous seven Republican and Democratic EERE heads in a June letter to Congress, objecting to the administration’s proposed 2018 budget that targeted DOE cuts, including a more than two-thirds reduction for EERE’s funding.The most important finding of all from the NRDC report, in Levin’s mind, is one that debunks a widely-held, but misguided belief about clean energy policies: that while they’re good for the environment, they come at a steep economic cost. The report found that as the country has made gains in clean energy, the average U.S. household also spent a record low amount of household income on energy ― less than 4 percent ― to fill up cars, power tablets, or heat homes.But if the government and businesses don’t continue investing in clean energy and smart climate policies, the consequences will be dire, Levin warned.“If we go above [the two degrees Celsius global warming threshold], it will result in catastrophic damages,” Levin said. “We start to lose island countries, we have large-scale climate migrants. It would happen over the next few decades, and would result in large losses for agriculture, and our countries.” "

34,SPORTS,New York Knicks Lock Arms During National Anthem After NBA Bans Kneeling,Carla Herreria,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-york-knicks-national-anthem_us_59d4169de4b04b9f9205eb8d,The league recently reminded teams about the rule on standing for the anthem.,2017-10-04,"The New York Knicks stand for the national anthem with linked arms before a preseason game on Oct. 3, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59d434cc200000f815084f37.jpeg?cache=QTi75b6QLz&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The New York Knicks remained standing for the national anthem ahead of their game Tuesday night, but the players linked arms instead of placing their hands over their hearts, as the team had said they would.The Knicks made their announcement in apparent response to the NBA’s memo, reportedly issued last week, that requires all players and coaches to stand during the patriotic pre-game moment.“We have a deep love and respect for this country,” the Knicks tweeted from their public relations account. “The United States has given us all so much including an unbelievable opportunity and platform to stand up for what’s right.”“Today, our country faces serious issues including gun violence, poverty, equal justice, access to education, and civil rights,” the team said, adding that their linked arms would be an effort to “call attention to these issues.”Standing together, the team said, “is how we honor the sacrifices made to defend liberties.” The Knicks’ gesture was the latest in a series of high-profile athletes’ protests against racial injustice sparked by former NFL star Colin Kaepernick in 2016. After Kaepernick began taking a knee during the national anthem to protest police shootings of black people, other professional athletes have followed suit. Some of them have chosen to make other protest gestures, including linking arms or remaining in the locker room while the anthem is played.President Donald Trump renewed the debate over these silent demonstrations in late September when he called the kneeling players “sons of bitches” and urged team owners to fire players who didn’t stand during the anthem. Trump’s remarks quickly inspired nearly all NFL teams to join the protest in some way during pre-game ceremonies. Soon after, NBA teams and even some Major League Baseball teams joined in.Responding to the new wave of protests, NBA commissioner Adam Silver said he expected all NBA players to stand for the anthem, but added that he also expected players to continue their civic engagement in other ways.This past Friday, a day after Silver’s comments, the league distributed the memo reminding teams of the rule that players and coaches must stand during the anthem, ESPN reports. The memo said that no team had the “discretion to waive” the rule and that the league had the power to discipline players who did not stand.Knicks players participated in the Kaepernick-inspired protests during the anthem last year, but this year feels different, according to star center Joakim Noah.“Obviously it’s a very confusing time in this country and as athletes, we have platforms,” Noah told the New York Post during a Saturday practice.“For some reason, I feel like things are a little different,” Noah said. “I don’t know why. I feel like there’s more emphasis on it. Shout out to Kaepernick for that.”"
35,PARENTS,These Social Media Apps Are Causing Trouble In Schools,"Common Sense Media, ContributorWe rate, educate, and advocate for kids, families, and schools.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/these-social-media-apps-are-causing-trouble-in-schools_us_59d527a6e4b0666ad0c3ca1a,Anonymous apps are notorious hubs for cyberbullying because kids feel emboldened to say things they wouldn’t normally.,2017-10-04,"<p>From teen hookups to live streaming, this year's hottest social media can lead kids to risky behavior.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59d52a0d20000014000851a2.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"How certain apps become popular with kids is a bit of a mystery. The best ones mix all the stuff tweens and teens love ― gossiping, hanging out, clowning around, and meeting other kids ― with an X factor that makes them go viral. Once an app gains critical mass (like, when every kid in school is on it), that’s when the real fun begins. But that’s where things can go wrong, too.While recent app crazes were all about the new and novel, such as Snapchat’s disappearing messages and WhatsApp’s free texting, this year’s social media giants mostly serve up familiar features. And though some new offerings correct safety issues of the past ― and kids are getting savvier about responsible use ― social media can still stir up drama. The ones to watch out for this year include anonymous apps, live streaming, group chatting, and friending, which bring up risks associated with giving blunt “feedback,” broadcasting yourself to the internet, oversharing and meeting strangers.It’s tough to keep up with all the latest apps kids get into. And the truth is, you don’t have to know every single detail of how each one works. The most important thing is to keep the lines of communication open with your kid. Talk about their social media, ask questions ― and listen. Pay attention to anything that sounds like a red flag and dig deeper. Helping your kid learn to use social media responsibly is the most effective way to help them stay safe online.Check out some of the apps that can potentially stir up drama in schools.Anonymous Apps These apps allow kids to provide anonymous, unsolicited, and unmoderated feedback to other users. Anonymous apps are notorious hubs for cyberbullying because kids feel emboldened to say things they wouldn’t normally. New apps in this category include safety precautions, but you should still keep an ear out for potential issues.Kiwi. This app and website lets people ask questions of friends or all users. Posts are tagged with your location (unless you turn it off), so all the kids at one school can be on the app. The combination of anonymity and proximity led to the downfall of similar apps such as YikYak.Sarahah. An Arabic word that translates roughly to “honesty,” Sarahah lets you send anonymous comments to friends. Some teens may use it to send anonymous messages with their schoolyard crushes, but more often it’s used to transmit all the mean things teens would never say to a friend’s face.TBH. Standing for “to be honest,” TBH lets kids answer mostly wholesome questions about friends. The app’s launch was pretty tame, but with anonymous apps’ poor track record, TBH’s planned chat function could get out of hand.Live Streaming As with live TV, users simply aim the camera on themselves and broadcast to whomever is following them. Since there’s no delay ― and kids are often streaming from their bedrooms ― there’s a real risk of giving away personal or even intimate information. This kind of oversharing can make kids vulnerable to “sextortion” because users can record the live streams. If a kid reveals too much, others can use the recordings against them.BIGO LIVE. BIGO lets users make video blogs or live stream their activities with the object of monetizing their videos and possibly becoming the next YouTube sensation. User-generated content can include bad language, violence, and nudity.Live.ly. Live.ly is an extension of the lip-syncing app Musical.ly ― which is known for its young users dancing suggestively. The app has no screening tools, so users who watch the streams are never entirely sure what they’re going to see when they open it up. And though the terms of use clearly define what objectionable content is not allowed, it also states that the developers have no obligation to respond to reports about violators.Live.me. Live.me has a racier feel than other live streamers. You’ll see everything from racial slurs to kids being asked to take off their clothing. The emphasis on getting followers and fame is even embedded in the title, which may propel people into doing more outrageous acts.YouNow. A very popular gathering place for kids, this app has its own celebrities and culture. Not only can you comment and like someone’s video, but you also can buy them gold bars or other gifts, which generates money for the broadcaster.Making New Friends The new “friending” apps enable kids to easily connect and chat with people they don’t know. While many of them rely on Snapchat or Instagram, they make it very easy to widen your circle of contacts to strangers. Friending apps also use location, so the new “friends” are all nearby, increasing the possibility of face-to-face meetings. Privacy and safety are real risks with these apps.MyLOL. MyLOL is an app and website advertised for “teen dating” but is really meant for users over the age of 17. Users often post provocative, half-naked pictures of themselves and engage in flirty or even sexually explicit conversation. Chat topics also can include references to drug use, alcohol, or violence. Some users post their real names, IM handles, email addresses, and phone numbers.Spotafriend. Billing itself as a Tinder alternative, this risky location-based app lets you rate other members (and lets other members rate you) by swiping left or right. It’s marketed as a teen “friend” app for users age 13 to 19, but comes with a Mature 17+ rating in the app stores.Yellow. Called “Tinder for teens,” Yellow works with your Snapchat or Instagram account and similarly to Tinder in that users swipe left or right on photos to find a match. Users don’t have the option to make their profile private, and your profile can be viewed by anyone in a particular radius of your real-life location.Group Video Chatting Group video chatting is the newfangled party line from the olden days of rotary phones. Using their webcams or phones, kids communicate with several friends at once via live video. Because there’s no screening, there’s always the possibility of kids sharing private information or encountering age-inappropriate content.Airtime. Airtime has most of the same features as other video-chat platforms but with the added twists of letting users watch videos and listen to music from across the web together. They can also live stream themselves. Viewing age-inappropriate content is a big risk, since there are no filters. And Airtime’s ability to create private “rooms” means kids could have one-on-one video chats with strangers.Houseparty. Unlike FaceTime or Skype, Houseparty lets you have up to eight people in a room and have several “parties” going at once. The app makes it easy for kids to connect with people they don’t know and have private conversations.Monkey. This app randomly connects teens with other Snapchat users around the world for a 10-second video chat. As with so many social networking tools, a teen’s experience will depend a lot on other users’ behavior. Some users report abuse and requests for baring body parts, so it could be easy for some teens to get into trouble with this one.Common Sense Media is an independent nonprofit organization offering unbiased ratings and trusted advice to help families make smart media and technology choices.

Video evidence later showed that statement was false.On Jan. 22, Kessler was at the Downtown Mall in Charlottesville, trying to collect signatures on a petition to oust City Councilor Wes Bellamy. When James Justin Taylor approached Kessler ― whom Taylor said he knew ― to learn about the petition, things got heated.“I really took issue not so much with the substance of it, but the way he was going about it,” Taylor told The Daily Progress. “This sort of aggressive fear, hate manner that it was being conducted. And I called him out on it. And he hit me.”“I said, paraphrasing, that ‘you’re kind of being an asshole,’” Taylor added.Kessler claimed that Taylor assaulted him and “violently” shook his arm. Video evidence released in March showed that to be false.“I’ll admit that what I did was not legal,” Kessler told The Daily Progress in April, after entering his guilty plea for the misdemeanor assault. “I was having a bad day. I’ve never done anything like this before and it will never happen again.”Kessler was sentenced in May and given a 30-day suspended sentence, along with 50 hours of community service.Kessler went on to organize August’s “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, which saw thousands of white supremacists flooding the streets with Nazi chants of “blood and soil!” and “Jews will not replace us!”Violent clashes took place during the rally, and one person, Heather Heyer, was killed after a car barreled into a crowd of peaceful counterprotesters. James Alex Fields Jr. was arrested in connection with the killing. Kessler later called Heyer a “fat, disgusting Communist.”Kessler was indicted Monday by an Albemarle County grand jury for the perjury charge. He faces up to 10 years in prison and a $2,500 fine. "

The popular illustration was shared widely on social media.“While I support people’s right to prayer and using prayer to care for themselves and their loved ones in the wake of a terrifying tragedy, I did not, nor do I, see how prayer even begins to address the issue underlying the mass shootings in Orlando [and] Newtown,” MacNaughton said.Little did she know that over a year later, her image would resurface in the aftermath of a tragedy in Las Vegas, the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.Sending victims, first responders, and even entire cities “thoughts and prayers” has become a knee-jerk reaction to national tragedies in the digital age. People flock to Facebook, Twitter, and other platforms to offer their condolences, share memes, and join in on trending hashtags. And it makes sense for mourners to grasp at old, familiar words in times of great suffering ― humans may have new tools and new ways of connecting, but we’re still the same sort of creatures that long ago formed liturgies, rituals, and prayers to bring order to the chaos and uncertainty of daily life. But something about the massacre that occurred in Las Vegas this weekend has awakened a different reaction in the national psyche. The eerily familiar national outpouring of condolences, particularly from politicians, is causing people like MacNaughton and even religious Americans who believe in the power of prayer to question whether these messages of “thoughts and prayers” are enough this time to comfort a nation continuously plagued by gun violence.For these religious and secular leaders, the problem isn’t that these politicians are praying. It’s what comes after they rise from their knees.Rabbi Rick Jacobs, president of the Union for Reform Judaism, the nation’s largest Jewish movement, told HuffPost that the country has reached a “saturation point” with gun violence ― so much so, that we “cannot simply go into automatic mode with thoughts and prayers.” “I don’t want to discount for a moment the spiritual power of prayer in sustaining a family or individual through an incredibly painful moment of grief or loss or pain. But if we don’t as a society remove the things that are causing needless suffering over and over again, we’ve lost our moral and religious leadership,” he said. At least 58 people died and hundreds of others were injured after a gunman opened fire at the Route 91 Harvest country music festival on Sunday. Suspected shooter Stephen Paddock had assembled an arsenal of more than 20 guns in the Mandalay Bay Resort hotel room from where he took aim at the crowd below. Among the array of devices Paddock gathered in the room were “bump stocks,” which allow a semiautomatic weapon to fire quickly, simulating a fully automatic weapon. President Donald Trump and other politicians on both sides of the aisle took to social media to offer their thoughts and prayers to the victims of the shooting.But for some, these thoughts and prayers seemed like empty gestures, especially if they were coming from politicians who accepted financial support from the National Rifle Association.These politicians’ responses to the Las Vegas massacre set off a debate about how to balance prayer with action after national tragedies.Former Arizona Democrat Gabby Giffords, who was herself a victim of gun violence, held a press conference on Monday demanding that Congress take legislative action. “What we’re hearing today at the Capitol and the White House are thoughts and prayers. Thoughts and prayers are important. We send our thoughts and prayers, too. But they are not enough,” Giffords’ husband, Mark Kelly, said at the conference. “Your thoughts and prayers aren’t going to stop the next shooting. Only action and leadership will do that.”Still, prayer does serve an important purpose, especially during a time of sorrow. For some, hearing a friend say, “My prayers and thoughts are with you,” can be an incredibly comforting act of solidarity and genuine compassion. For religious congregations, prayer can be the first step towards mobilizing communities to organize a joint response to a national tragedy.Jacobs said that in the aftermath of Las Vegas, prayer can help mourners through the grief of dealing with the loss of loved ones whose lives were cut off abruptly and harshly.“I’ve spent a career in hospital rooms where people are going through the most difficult and painful life passages. I believe deeply in the power of prayer to give people strength and love and hope, a connection to that higher power of God,” the rabbi said. “But I would never say to somebody who needs treatment, ‘You don’t need to go to the hospital, just stay here and we’ll pray for you.’ I believe in the power of prayer but I also believe in the power of human beings to work in ways to heal the world.”David Silverman, president of the advocacy group American Atheists, told HuffPost that he understands the initial impulse people have to say that their “thoughts and prayers” are with victims of a tragedy. After Las Vegas, the organization also tweeted out that its thoughts were with the victims.“When we said we have the victims and their families in our thoughts, we mean that we’re trying to put ourselves in their shoes and asked ourselves how we would want people and our government to respond if we were them.”He believes that there’s been a backlash against the phrase “thoughts and prayers” specifically because “too many politicians who are in a position to affect policy change do nothing but offer those thoughts and prayers.”For those who believe in a higher power, prayer is not just about empathizing ― it can also be a way to ask God for help or guidance. The Rev. James Martin SJ, editor-at-large of the Jesuit magazine America, told HuffPost that for Christians, prayer is about relationship, with God and with fellow human beings. Sometimes, prayer calls Christians to do something practical ― like donate money or rebuild a house. But sometimes, it calls people to simply sit at the bedside of someone who is dying ― which, he argues, is also a compassionate “act.”Martin doesn’t think “thoughts and prayers” always signify an empty gesture. It depends on the follow-up.“If someone says to me in a time of need, ‘My thoughts and prayers are with you,’ and actually shows that he or she is thinking of me by helping in some way, and then actually prays for me, then I’m grateful,” he said. “If someone just says, ‘My thoughts and prayers are with you,’ and if they are neither actually thinking about how they can help you, nor praying for you, then it’s not doing much good.”He agreed that politicians have an even heavier responsibility than most people to accompany prayers with action.“If someone wants to help prevent these kinds of things from happening, then one must act. Otherwise what ‘thoughts’ is one thinking other than, ‘How sad?’”The Rev. Dr. Katharine R. Henderson, president of Auburn Seminary, said that prayers are always beneficial but that “they too often are used for cover by elected officials.”“It’s their job to grapple with the epidemic of gun violence. After they pray, they need to legislate,” she said.Imam Suhaib Webb, resident scholar at the Islamic Center of New York University, told HuffPost he believes prayer brings together humility with thankfulness. “My secular friends tend to assume that prayer is an excuse to avoid responsibility, hence they dismiss it,” Webb said. “In Islam, there is no true prayer unless it is coupled with action.”The problem with public acts of prayer for Webb is that they sometimes encourage people to pray with an audience in mind.“I appreciate anyone’s prayers, but prefer, especially with politicians, that they keep it to themselves because politicians tend to speak in a voice that seeks to please their backers, is devoid of sincerity and tends to be masked by an agenda. Prayer is about sincerity and honesty, not likes and attention,” he said. “Thus, with some politicians prayer becomes another check mark on the ‘things to do’ list, instead of an intense experience that will lead to a commitment to good and a faithful effort to create change.”“When praying for any cause we must be certain that we are invested in strategic work and organizing that will bring that prayer to life. While praying for the victims of any tragedy is commendable, if our actions don’t support the prayer we made, we risk reducing prayer to a hollow ritual, instead of an instrument for change.”For MacNaughton, the illustrator whose criticism of hollow prayer drew attention online, this standard of always pairing “thoughts” with actions applies to secular folk, too. “I’m glad if this image helps people publicly articulate their feelings in response to gun violence,” she told HuffPost. “However, if sharing a message like this isn’t accompanied with meaningful action (i.e. calling our representatives and demanding policy change or they’ll lose our vote) then sharing an image on social media is as useless as offering digital ‘thoughts and prayers.’”Correction: A previous version of this article misspelled Wendy MacNaughton’s last name.

The popular illustration was shared widely on social media.“While I support people’s right to prayer and using prayer to care for themselves and their loved ones in the wake of a terrifying tragedy, I did not, nor do I, see how prayer even begins to address the issue underlying the mass shootings in Orlando [and] Newtown,” MacNaughton said.Little did she know that over a year later, her image would resurface in the aftermath of a tragedy in Las Vegas, the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.Sending victims, first responders, and even entire cities “thoughts and prayers” has become a knee-jerk reaction to national tragedies in the digital age. People flock to Facebook, Twitter, and other platforms to offer their condolences, share memes, and join in on trending hashtags. And it makes sense for mourners to grasp at old, familiar words in times of great suffering ― humans may have new tools and new ways of connecting, but we’re still the same sort of creatures that long ago formed liturgies, rituals, and prayers to bring order to the chaos and uncertainty of daily life.

Since the family lived in a neighborhood with several backyard pools, Stolman made it a priority to have her son learn how to swim as soon as possible. While doing research, she learned about the Jersey Hammerheads and the mission behind the team. “Families raising children with developmental disabilities are often told what their child can’t do or won’t do, and our children are often segregated from their typical peers at an early age,” Stolman told HuffPost. “Coach Mike told me he was starting a new team and his team would ‘dominate the competition.’ He was saying ‘yes’ despite all the ‘no’s’ I had been told.”Though her son was too young at the time to swim on the team, Stolman knew the Hammerheads’ story needed to be told.

Stolman said it was “a joy” working with the swimmers and noted that she felt like she was part of the team while filming.“At first, they all waved at the cameras and crew and it took some time to teach the children on the team not to make faces and wave,” she said. “But pretty soon, they all became used to us and forgot what we were doing there.”Stolman hopes “Swim Team” educates people about autism and the abilities of people who have it. “Too often, these kids and adults are excluded from public school, community recreation and employment opportunities and yet they have so much to offer,” she said.“Swim Team” will air on PBS and will be available to stream for free on PBS’ site throughout the month."

42,POLITICS,"Heckled And Disrupted, White Supremacists Held A Not-So-Secret Meeting In Tennessee","Jessica Schulberg, Dana Liebelson, and Luke O'Brien",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stormfront-conference-crossvilletennessee_us_59d2cbc0e4b065578154e963,Protesters crashed Stormfront's closed-door conference in the woods.,2017-10-03,People attending a conference in Tennessee for neo-Nazi internet forum Stormfront.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59d2cce52d000097173084d6.jpeg?cache=CriLJk3GoD&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Something old, something new, some neo-Nazis and some anti-fascists, too.On Saturday at Cumberland Mountain State Park in Crossville, Tennessee, a wedding party unwittingly shared space with about 30 white supremacists attending a conference for prominent neo-Nazi internet forum Stormfront, along with dozens of peaceful protesters who were chanting and drumming in the parking lot.Less than two months after the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, the prospect of white supremacists descending on a small town in East Tennessee stirred concerns of more violence. A conference organizer boasted the event would attract a “couple hundred” attendees, although white supremacists often inflate such figures, and they expressed worries about being confronted by anti-fascists. But ultimately, the conference unfolded in the manner of many furtive neo-Nazi meet-ups ― the racists were found out, and assembled in underwhelming numbers in front of a clutch of protesters. In the end, pathos and bathos vied for supremacy instead.The white supremacists had been long planning a conference in East Tennessee, according to posts on Stormfront, but they were careful to keep the specific location secret. On Friday, HuffPost reported that conference attendees would meet that night at the Beef and Barrel Restaurant & Lounge and convene Saturday in the Cumberland Mountain State Park for a strategy meeting. Cumberland County is 97 percent white, which is one reason conference organizers chose it as a destination. Matthew Heimbach, the most prominent white supremacist in attendance, has directed his neo-Nazi organization, the Traditionalist Worker Party, to do charity outreach in areas with similar demographics, hoping to win sympathy among low-income white communities and, eventually, run local candidates of his own. On his way to the conference, Heimbach or members of his organization reportedly posted TWP fliers on the the University of Tennessee-Knoxville campus.The Stormfront group faced complications from the beginning. Beef and Barrel canceled the group’s reservation, hours after the owner, Bruce Cannon, told HuffPost it was not his place to determine who eats at his restaurant. (Activists flocked to social media to shame the business before it canceled the reservation.) Crossville Police Department officers were called to the restaurant to deal with people who were “making a bunch of noise” in the parking lot, Lt. Brian Eckelson said. Barred from Beef and Barrel, the Stormfront group reassembled at a nearby restaurant called Shoney’s, Knoxville News Sentinel reported. (Shoney’s denied hosting Stormfront or any large group of men on Friday.)On Saturday morning, a couple preparing for their wedding in the state park learned the white supremacists would be gathering nearby, along with protesters. “We were not aware of what either group represented at the time,” the couple, who requested anonymity, told HuffPost in a Facebook message. Across the river, about two dozen anti-Nazi protesters, including one clad in cookie-sheet armor, assembled in a parking lot outside the recreation lodge, drumming, picnicking and hurling taunts through a megaphone as swastika-adorned white supremacists wearing helmets and carrying shields walked past them. Park rangers offered to escort protesters to and from the bathroom.The protest, a last-minute effort organized by Knoxville criminal defense lawyer Chris Irwin, attracted “punk” kids from nearby schools, Native Americans and members of a nearby Tibetan Buddhist monastery, Irwin said. One of the punks recognized a local man heading into the recreation lodge and called the man’s girlfriend to tell her where he was, according to Irwin.“Good morning, master race!” Irwin shouted at conference-goers as they arrived.By late afternoon, the bride and groom could still hear protesters shouting at white supremacists. They were concerned the commotion would continue into the ceremony and reception, and that guests would have a difficult time getting to the wedding. They said they did not ask anyone to lower their voices, though a park ranger asked the protesters to lay off the megaphone, Irwin said, and they obliged.“After six and a half hours straight of heckling, we had used up our best material,” said Irwin, who reported that none of the white supremacists took him up on his offer to pay for their genetic testing.Tennessee state parks are required by law to provide public facilities to individuals and groups regardless of their beliefs, according to Eric Ward, the communications director for Tennessee’s Department of Environment and Conservation. “When someone reserves our facilities, they are not required to state whether they are affiliated with a specific organization,” Ward explained.The Stormfront conference was scheduled to conclude Sunday with a nature walk through a forest to honor former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke. The protesters spread out into the woods, looking for white supremacists on the trails, but they were able to identify only two, Irwin said. Both the neo-Nazis and the protesters claimed victory at the event’s conclusion, which is to say both partially failed in their aims. Despite “every conceivable obstacle being thrown at us, our event was a success,” one Stormfront user wrote, echoing a sentiment widely shared on the forum. But at least two people left the conference to avoid getting their picture taken by protesters, said Francis John Gilroy, a white supremacist who attended, on Stormfront radio Monday. And another Stormfront user wrote that he was disappointed to hear there were only 30 people at the conference. “Please tell me there was a bigger meeting at the farm or some hidden location,” he wrote. “This group obviously needs new leadership!” Meanwhile, Irwin exulted, “We may have blown apart the next Charlottesville.” Still, the white supremacists were able to meet behind closed doors and plan strategy going forward. Conference attendees forged new alliances, Gilroy said. They discussed tactics like flash mobs and other “street theater” to engage the media, and brainstormed ways to get white supremacists elected into public office. By Monday, the hosts of Stormfront’s radio show were already agog over the next conference, date and location to be determined. It was sure to be bigger and better than Crossville, they agreed.Do you know anything about this or any other white supremacist conferences? Email us at scoops@huffingtonpost.com"

The newsman, who is 77, contrasted his memories of America in his youth with what he sees around him now.“This country obviously is the greatest experiment in self-rule, the rule of law. People come from all over the world because they want to be part of the American dream,” Brokaw said in his introduction. “I grew up as part of that, but now we’re going to look back on this era and we’re going to think about mass murderers, shootings that have no rationale whatsoever.”“This time it was a crowded concert in Las Vegas,” Brokaw said in the segment. “Another made-in-America mass murder to go with others: the massacre at an elementary school in Connecticut, the slaughter at Virginia Tech. Of the 17 mass murders since the ’60s, only two relate to Islamic terror: the tragedies in Orlando and in San Bernardino.”Later in the clip, Brokaw charged Americans “cannot have a civil debate about guns and their use.”“As guns become more lethal, so does the political debate become more toxic,” he said.“The NRA, one of the most powerful lobbies in American politics, has temporarily suspended commercials in the Virginia governor’s race, but it will return. Already, gun enthusiasts are locked and loaded, ready for the coming debate after Las Vegas.”After the segment had ended, Brokaw said gun violence “is an issue that requires the best efforts of all of us.”“This has got to go to the top of the agenda in American life.”The full text of Brokaw’s segment is below:This time it was a crowded concert in Las Vegas. Another made-in-America mass murder to go with others: the massacre at an elementary school in Connecticut, the slaughter at Virginia Tech. Of the 17 mass murders since the ’60s, only two relate to Islamic terror: the tragedies in Orlando and in San Bernardino.And once again, we’re in the middle of a debate about guns in America. The percentage of Americans who own guns is going down, an estimated 32%. But gun owners are stockpiling even more weapons. The average owner now has at least eight weapons.And ironically, the outcry over Las Vegas will drive more owners to buy more guns and more ammo, worrying that there will be more restrictions.In entertainment, guns are essential to what we see on the screens. Video games rely on firearm violence. Yet, we cannot have a civil debate about guns and their use. As guns become more lethal, so does the political debate become more toxic.The NRA, one of the most powerful lobbies in American politics, has temporarily suspended commercials in the Virginia governor’s race, but it will return.Already, gun enthusiasts are locked and loaded, ready for the coming debate after Las Vegas.In Las Vegas, a commentary on our time. When the concertgoers heard the gunshots, they knew to run or to comfort each other and seek sanctuary in each other’s arms.And now it’s left to the Rolodex of the Las Vegas dead and wounded to mourn, and to pray for their recovery.This story was originally published on Yahoo News."

46,EDUCATION,Housing Crisis In California Forces More Students Into Homelessness,"EdSource, ContributorNonprofit news site focused on education policy and its effects",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/housing-crisis-in-california-forces-more-students-into_us_59d3d87be4b0da85e7f5ec42,"Since 2014, the number of homeless children in California has jumped 20 percent.",2017-10-03,<p>Alison often studies on the bed that she shares with her parents who work in the nearby strawberry fields.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59d3d8992000001400084e3d.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Carolyn JonesAlison is only 14 but she knows what she wants to be when she grows up: A surgeon. It’s not easy to study, however, when you’re so exhausted and hungry you can barely get through 9th-grade biology.An immigrant from Colombia, Alison is one of more than 200,000 K-12 students in California considered homeless because they lack stable housing. And like most of those students, she lives with her family in a home shared with other families — in her case, two other families.“I go to school every day because I like school, but sometimes I can’t concentrate,” said the Santa Maria teenager whose district reports nearly a third of its students are homeless. “When you’re that tired it affects your personality. You feel like … not much.”As California’s housing costs continue to soar, more and more children like Alison are suffering the severest of consequences: No place to call home. Since 2014, the number of homeless children in California has jumped 20 percent. In the most recently released data, 202,329 young people are living in cars, motels, shelters, on the street or in crowded homes shared with other families.That’s just over 3 percent of the enrolled K-12 students, more than twice the national rate, but the actual numbers are almost certainly higher. Schools rely on parents to report their housing status, but shame, fear of deportation or the government taking away their children discourage many parents from truthfully answering the housing questionnaire — typically given to all families at the beginning of the school year.For families like Alison’s, filling out forms and staying on top of school requirements is not always easy. Her family, for example, has moved six times, including a stint in a rented van, since they left Colombia three years ago.EdSource is not using the students’ last names in this story to protect their privacy.By law, schools are required to identify and help homeless students, using state and federal funds to provide school supplies, extra tutoring, transportation to school or whatever else students need to succeed. But an EdSource analysis shows that more than a quarter of California schools report no homeless students at all and provide no services — despite the fact that homeless students live in nearly every community of California, experts say.“The rate of youth homelessness in California is unconscionable,” said Shahera Hyatt, director of the California Homeless Youth Project, a state agency. “Part of it is we’ve gotten better at counting our homeless students, but there’s no question the housing crisis is playing a role. Housing is a fundamental need, and this crisis needs to be taken more seriously. …. The human and economic cost is great.”Most of California’s homeless children, 86 percent in 2015, are not homeless in the traditional sense, state data show. They live with their families and have a roof overhead, but share living quarters with other families because they can’t afford their own residence. These families tend to move frequently, and the constant noise hinders attempts to study or sleep. And privacy in the bathroom? Forget it.“When you’re living like that, you’re embarrassed to go. So you hold it,” Alison said.In school, homeless children face daunting challenges, and need social services and academic help perhaps more than any other subgroup. Faced with extreme poverty, stress and, like Alison, just plain exhaustion, those children are far more likely to struggle academically and drop out of school than their peers.“It’s a snowball effect,” said Emily Allen, a program director for the United Way of Northern Santa Barbara County, which serves homeless and low-income residents. “They miss school because they’re tired, or don’t have money for bus fare, or they’re ashamed because they have nowhere to take a shower. Or they don’t have a quiet place to do homework and the teachers don’t understand. And they fall further and further behind.”The federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, enacted in 1987, and a state law passed in 2015 require schools to provide services to these students, and money is available through federal grants and the state Local Control Funding Formula.But the money is not nearly enough, and California does not receive nearly what it’s due, Hyatt said. In California, only 61 of the state’s 1,025 school districts received extra funds to support homeless children in the most recent round of grants, in 2016. In all, the state awarded $7.6 million in 2016, with the largest grants — $242,858 — going to districts like Los Angeles Unified, San Diego Unified and Fresno Unified, and grants as small as $15,704 going to 395-student Laytonville Unified in rural Mendocino County.The distribution of homeless children in California varies widely. An EdSource analysis of state data reveals that while most homeless students live in large cities, some small cities and rural areas show even higher rates of homeless students.At one extreme is Baker, population 735, an isolated burg along Interstate 15 in the Mojave Desert where 52 percent of the students in the Baker Valley Unified School District are reported homeless. But in Piedmont, an exclusive Bay Area city in the Oakland hills, Piedmont High reported zero homeless students. Los Angeles Unified saw its number of homeless children double last year, to 13,763, or 2.91 percent of the total enrollment, but that’s partly because more families submitted the housing questionnaire, staff said.Perhaps no place in California bears the extremes of wealth and poverty more acutely than Santa Barbara County. Its rolling coastal bluffs are home to millionaire retirees, while inland schools, amid the broccoli and strawberry fields of the Santa Maria Valley, have some of the highest percentages of homeless children in the state. At Sanchez Elementary in Santa Maria, nearly half the students lack stable housing.But homeless children are also found in the affluent southern end of the county, forced into living with other families due to the exorbitant cost of housing. That combination of low-paying agricultural and service jobs coupled with high housing costs gives Santa Barbara County the highest rate of children living in poverty in the state, at 30.8 percent, based on local cost of living and federal poverty data, according to the Public Policy Institute of California.The county is a tale of extremes in another way, as well. Santa Maria-Bonita, where Alison attends high school, is one of the 61 districts statewide to win a grant to serve homeless students. With its $170,000 windfall, the district contracts with a nonprofit called Fighting Back Santa Maria Valley to provide services specially tailored to its 5,272 homeless students.But Santa Barbara Unified, 63 miles to the southeast, has 1,287 homeless children but did not receive a grant. For several years the district benefitted from a grant the County Office of Education received, but that grant expired in 2015 and was not renewed. Now, Santa Barbara Unified as well as other local districts rely on school staff — who are already swamped with other duties — to identify homeless kids and refer them to services, said Dolores Daniel, program manager for the Santa Barbara County Office of Education’s Transitional Youth Services division.“I’m sure some students are missed,” she said. “We’d like to provide more support, but this is the best we can do until another grant comes through.”It’s a different story in Santa Maria-Bonita which reports 31 percent homeless students. The district and Fighting Back Santa Maria Valley provide homeless students and their families everything from bus passes and clothing to translators who speak indigenous Mexican languages. But the most crucial service, according to Fighting Back executive director Edwin Weaver, is home visits.Parents are often so busy and exhausted, working in the fields 12-plus hours a day, they don’t have time to attend school meetings or catch up on paperwork. This can be a particular challenge if their English skills are poor. So case workers will visit families at home and ask what they need for their children to succeed.“They’ll tell you,"" said Weaver. ""You just need to listen.""In one case, a 10-year-old boy was an hour late for school every day. A visit to his home revealed that he was late because his parents left for work at 5 a.m. every morning and he had to get his 2-year-old brother to day care, then get himself to school. So the case worker arranged for a neighborhood mom to take the 2-year-old to day care and bought the 10-year-old an alarm clock. Now the child is on time every day.Sometimes, helping the parents is the best way to help the children, Weaver said. In Santa Maria, most of the parents work in the fields, leaving before dawn and often working until evening. Some get paid minimum wage, which equals $420 a week before taxes, while others get paid by the amount of produce they gather. Strawberry pickers, for example, earn about $1 to $1.50 per box, according to the United Farm Workers union.Some of the Latin American immigrant parents have been working since they were 8 or 9 years old, have never attended school and can’t read or write, Weaver said. Between 5 and 25 percent don’t speak Spanish — they speak indigenous Mixteco languages from Oaxaca and other southern Mexico states.They face daunting challenges trying to get by in the U.S., but they’re unequivocal about what they want for their children: an education.“They say to their kids, ‘Do better than us. You can do better.’ They want their kids to have more choices than they’ve had,” said Moses Hernandez, a program specialist at Fighting Back.Weaver added, “They put up with a lot — getting up at 4:30 a.m. every day, stooping over in the fields picking strawberries, coming home at 7 p.m. covered in mud and then going out to a parenting class, doing without — just to give their kids a better life. So we do what we can to make that possible.”Fighting Back case workers help parents understand the basics of American education, such as how to read a report card, how to talk to teachers and how to fill out forms. The district offers adult literacy and parenting classes, and shows parents how to promote literacy for their children even if they themselves don’t speak English or can’t read.Another nonprofit, Central Coast Future Leaders, helps homeless and immigrant students get to college. Students learn about college admissions, financial aid and choosing a career, and tour nearby college campuses. For many, college dorms are the first place they’ve slept in their own bed, and the most stable, quiet living quarters they’ve experienced, said Patricia Solorio, former Future Leaders executive director.Alison was among a few dozen immigrant teenagers from Santa Maria who took a Future Leaders field trip to UC Santa Barbara over the summer. The students slept in dorms, met college students who were also immigrants, got a taste of college life, and learned how to apply to school and get financial aid.These programs have been successful in propelling students out of poverty, Solorio said. In the past few years, Future Leaders alumni have gone on to Harvard, Columbia, UC Berkeley, UCLA, Yale and other top universities.“These young people need to feel like they belong, that there’s a place for them, that they can succeed here,” she said. “Ultimately it comes down to economics. California needs these young people in the workforce. We all need these kids to succeed.”But the best way to help homeless children does not involve tutoring or free backpacks, said Frank Rodriguez, an organizer at Cause, Central Coast housing nonprofit. It’s to give them a place to live.California housing costs, even in low-income areas like Santa Maria, are among the highest in the U.S., according to the most recent figures from the Council for Community and Economic Research. A rented bedroom in a house in Santa Maria can cost $800 per month, according to Craigslist, and the county vacancy rate is 1.1 percent.“People are afraid if they get an eviction notice, they’ll end up living in their car,” Rodriguez said. “And the ones who pay the most in those situations, unfortunately, are kids.”Communities need to fight for affordable housing and tenant protections, he said. Schools alone cannot solve the homeless crisis, he said.But despite the challenges, California’s homeless children can be as idealistic and determined as their peers. They want to go to college and work, and some say they’re highly motivated not to be homeless as adults.“I want to make a change,” Alison said, when asked of her goals for the next decade. “In 10 years, I’ll still be in college, because I’ll be studying to be a surgeon. I want things to be different.”Alison’s classmates had similar high hopes. Adriana, 15, wants to go to UC Santa Barbara and study marine biology or English literature. She was born in Michoacan, Mexico and now lives in a house with three other families, and shares a bed with her two little sisters. So when it’s too noisy to study at home, she goes to the library.“I want to make my parents proud and someday help them with money,” she said. “I also want to show people that Mexicans are meant for a lot more than just working in the fields.”Rowdy, 17, is from Mexico City and wants to be an artist or musician. Or maybe join the military, he said. He lives in a home with 22 other people.“I want to work hard and someday move to a city,” he said. “I want to be someone in life.”Fourteen-year-old Fany, who’s from Oaxaca, has only been in the United States a few months but is excited to learn English and goes to after-school tutoring classes to catch up academically. To avoid the distractions at her home, which she shares with three families, she stays late at school to study.Eventually, she wants to be a social justice attorney.“I know I’m not in the best situation, but there are some people not as privileged as me,” she said. “I want to help those people. My parents think it might be dangerous, but I’m passionate about wanting to help people.”Alison and her family were not always impoverished. In Colombia they had their own home and a middle-class lifestyle. But when local drug dealers threatened her father after he reported them to the police, the family fled — first to Peru, then Florida, and finally to California.In Florida, the family lived in a room with no furniture, not even beds. Her parents and older siblings worked as vegetable packers while Alison went to school. But after a few months the woman who ran the house, whose name Alison never knew, evicted them with just a week’s notice and no explanation.Unable to find new lodgings, the family rented a van and slept there.“It was so cold, I’d wake up at 4 every morning. Even your bones feel cold. It wasn’t right,” she said. “I went to school but I was sleepless. When it came to food, we didn’t always have any. And with the language — at school, I didn’t even understand when they said my name. I was very shy. I didn’t have any friends. I’d sit in a corner.”After another few moves, the family settled in Santa Maria, to be near relatives. They now live in a home with her uncle’s family and another family. Alison is working on her English, studying hard and determined to succeed.“I’m going to go to college,” she said. “I plan on it.”This story originally appeared on EdSource.org"

Obama joked that things were simpler when everyone had a landline phone at home. “Gone are the days when the [landline] phone would ring ― you remember that? ― in your house,” she said. “And you would pick it up and someone would say, ‘Hello, Mrs. Such-And-Such. My name is Blank, and I’m calling to speak to Malia.’ And you’d go, ‘This is the person who’s talking to my daughter’ ― boy, girl, whatever.”Because many people now have handheld devices keeping them in touch, landline phones aren’t as popular, leaving Obama in the dark when it comes to all her daughters’ friends ― even their closest ones. “There are friends that I don’t know they have,” she said. “And they’re shocked when it’s like, ‘I’m going to Such-And-Such’s house,’ and I’m like, ‘Who’s that?’” Obama and Rhimes shared memories of stretching out their landline phones’ cords and getting tangled in them while talking with their friends, while also being completely aware that their parents knew everything they were saying and how long they were on the phone.Funny, nostalgic stories aside, Obama noted that though she has her worries about technology, she also appreciates her daughters’ ability to easily experience different cultures and access vast amounts of information.Obama also described what her parents were like when she was a kid. Rhimes asked Obama how she overcame her doubts and learned the importance of having a voice. Obama explained that though some women struggle to ensure their opinions are heard, her parents always encouraged her and her brother to speak up.“They made room for our voices at a very young age, and I don’t mean in any symbolic way,” she said. “I just mean sitting at the dinner table, really listening to what we had to say and laughing at our jokes and allowing our opinions to come into the conversation, not always shushing us.” "

This was following an extremely racist election campaign, in which he falsely insinuated that his opponent, incumbent Democratic lawmaker Dwight Bullard, supported terrorism. Fast forward to September, District 40 is once again held by a Democrat. After a grueling special election that cost millions of dollars and defied the predictions of most political pundits, Annette Taddeo beat former Florida Republican State Rep. Jose Felix Diaz by a margin of 51 to 47 percent, becoming the first Democrat to win this district in over a decade, even though she was outspent three to one.The result of this election means that the Florida electorate is closer to seeing parity and balance in its legislature. Democrats now hold 16 seats and Republicans, 24. The Florida Republican Party has used its majority to gerrymander legislative districts and push forward an extremist agenda, which includes the criminalization of immigrant communities, the expansion of for-profit charter schools and weakening environmental regulations. That’s why elections like these matter.However, this win for Democrats is not isolated to Florida alone. Nationwide, Democratic candidates have picked up seats in red districts in New Hampshire, Oklahoma and New York. Throughout the latter part of the Obama administration, the Democratic Party saw their legislative power erode as state and federal seats went to Republican candidates. In the Trump era, this trend appears to be rapidly reversing itself as polling shows Trump has low approval ratings, hovering at 37 percent. As the Florida elections shows, his unstable and irresponsible actions are becoming a drag on down-ballot candidates from his party.It seems this was not lost on Annette Taddeo. She and the Florida Democratic Party tied her opponent Jose Felix Diaz to Trump, cutting television ads and mailers showing a selfie of him and Trump taken at the White House. The results of this election show that Florida’s diverse communities reject the extremist policies espoused by the Trump. These communities reject ripping apart families and demeaning the very same immigrants who have contributed to our cities and economy. Voters stood up for the immigrants who have helped build so much of Miami-Dade County, which includes Senate District 40.This is a warning shot to the hateful and divisive rhetoric stemming from the Trump Administration and his local allies in Florida. People will not stand for it. State Senator Taddeo won because she espoused common sense and policies that work for everyone, such as support for driver's licenses for all Floridians and a commitment to our hard-working immigrant families. Republicans leadership in Florida would be wise to learn from these results and distance themselves from the Trump administration policies, not just through words but also through actions. Voters will punish candidates at the ballot box who do not stand with their family, friends and neighbors.Thomas Kennedy is a communications fellow for the Center for Community Change."

They track critters. They track infected people. If a bushmeat hunter kills an animal and the carcass tests positive for monkeypox, Laudisoit’s team is on it.“I’m not afraid ― you just need to be careful where you work,” she said, standing among frames of squashed squirrels, stuffed rodents and monkey skulls at the Centre for Biodiversity at the University of Kisangani, in the Democratic Republic of Congo’s third largest city.But when a virus is so overlooked that it doesn’t even appear on the World Health Organization’s list of neglected diseases, trying to raise awareness means visiting areas where few Westerners have come before ― except to plunder resources.“If you’re a white person and you come sailing down the river in a dugout canoe for four days and trekking through the forest, people think you’re coming for diamonds and gold,” Laudisoit said.Far from seeking Congo’s riches, she is looking for the origin of monkeypox. The disease was named in 1958 after it was discovered in laboratory monkeys brought from Asia to Denmark, but it originated in the forests that Laudisoit now roams.Monkeypox was traced to Congo in 1970, when it was first found in humans. It initially causes fever, headache, muscle aches and exhaustion, and later painful lesions that blister, scab and can cause fatal infections usually from septicemia, especially in people with weak immune systems.The virus is now known to be found in remote tropical rainforests and in 10 or so west and central African countries. And it could be spreading on the back of one of mankind’s greatest public health successes ― the eradication of smallpox.In 1980, after some 3,000 years and hundreds of millions of deaths, the world celebrated the global eradication of smallpox, a virus with a 30 percent mortality rate. It was, and remains, the only human infectious disease to be wiped from the planet. But that achievement also meant an end to smallpox inoculations.In Congo, home to more than 80 million people, the loss of the smallpox vaccine ― which provides up to 85 percent immunity against monkeypox ― has led to “an increase in cases, primarily among young people, because the herd immunity is going down,” Laudisoit said.According to Laudisoit, there were just under 50 cases of monkeypox in the 1970s. Now, some areas report more than 250 cases each year. And it’s not an isolated problem. Of the total 516 health zones that Congo’s Ministry of Health monitors, 216 have reported at least one case of monkeypox.“Almost half a country that is four times as big as France is at risk of developing a disease like smallpox,” she said.Laudisoit often goes to events held by international health organizations to share her knowledge and concerns about monkeypox. She says she sees the same apathy toward this virus as there once was toward Ebola, which was discovered in Congo in the 1970s.“They don’t care about black people dying in the bush,” Laudisoit said. “They knew about Zika for 70 years in Uganda ― but when it affects Olympic Games and golfers, then they care.”“At conferences, I ask, ‘If a place as big as France, Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands combined had a case of something like smallpox, wouldn’t we have already reacted and already revaccinated people?’ You’ve got to ask, because that’s exactly what’s happening here.”Research into monkeypox is so minimal that Laudisoit’s team ― going village to village to record cases and train medics in how to identify the rash ― has cast doubt on existing data. For instance, the World Health Organization estimates that the virus kills between 1 and 10 percent of victims during an outbreak. But Laudisoit and her team have documented mortality rates that are much higher.“The figures are completely obsolete because there are no recent studies,” she said. “Last year, I investigated an epidemic. We went to a village where there were 61 cases, and 12 deaths” ― almost double the stated mortality rate.There had been little interest in funding research and vaccines for monkeypox until a 2003 outbreak in the U.S. caused by African giant pouched rats imported from Ghana to Texas.The virus spread from the rats to native prairie dogs at an Illinois pet dealership to more than 70 people across Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, Missouri, Kansas and Ohio.No one died from these first human monkeypox infections outside Africa, and the virus was quickly contained.But ”it could have been a different story,” Laudisoit thinks, had the U.S. been hit by the much more virulent Central African strain, which comes from Congo and which, unlike its West African cousin, can kill humans.Still, the outbreak resulted in the U.S. tightening restrictions on animals imported from Africa. And the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ― which lists the Central African strain of monkeypox alongside anthrax, SARS and Ebola as a potential bioweapon ― sent teams to places like Congo to search for the virus.But while CDC teams focus their efforts on human cases, Laudisoit says she and her team “are interested in finding the animal reservoirs.” She wants to see more collaboration between virologists, medics and biologists to crack this disease, which, like Ebola and Zika, could mutate, find new hosts and travel farther to infect more people.Dr. Jean-Jacques Muyembe ― a top Congolese virologist who treated the first known Ebola cases and helped work on a vaccine that was ignored until the virus hit the U.S. ― is still warning developed countries about overlooked diseases that are increasingly spreading.“These neglected diseases can become a threat to developed countries,” Muyembe said. “With travel and everything we have now, the world has become a village.”“Everything comes from animals,” he added, “and [Congo’s] ecology is one that favors the emergence of these new diseases.” While smallpox could be eradicated because it only existed in humans, “monkeypox probably has 10 or so animal reservoirs,” Laudisoit said. “So we need a vaccine, because we can’t exactly kill all the animals.”This year, the CDC, in partnership with the Kinshasa School of Public Health and Congo’s Ministry of Health, started trials with an injectable vaccine on some 1,000 Congolese health workers in Tshuapa province and some lab workers in the capital.“Our big push now is trying to get health care workers protected against this,” said Benjamin Monroe, a monkeypox specialist at the CDC.Monroe has seen a resurgence of monkeypox cases in the last couple of years, citing Sierra Leone and the Central African Republic as examples of where more cases are being reported. But he’s not worried about a global pandemic.“I don’t think monkeypox will become a mutant, rampant virus and take over the world,” he said. “And if it were to, we already have strategies and vaccines from eradicating smallpox. You can pull out that playbook, dust it off and do it again if you had to.” But rolling out a new and expensive monkeypox vaccine to all those at risk would require serious international funding for something that’s considered a disease of poverty, Monroe noted.“Incredibly poor people who are forced into the forest to subsist on what they can are the people we see getting these diseases,” he said.And Laudisoit sees little hope on the horizon for them.“For as long as there’s not a white person who has monkeypox ― with spots like in the ’60s from smallpox ― there will be a lack of money,” she said. “I assure you that when that happens, within three days, there will be funding, and that’s true for all neglected diseases.”This series is supported, in part, by funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

And the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ― which lists the Central African strain of monkeypox alongside anthrax, SARS and Ebola as a potential bioweapon ― sent teams to places like Congo to search for the virus.But while CDC teams focus their efforts on human cases, Laudisoit says she and her team “are interested in finding the animal reservoirs.” She wants to see more collaboration between virologists, medics and biologists to crack this disease, which, like Ebola and Zika, could mutate, find new hosts and travel farther to infect more people.Dr. Jean-Jacques Muyembe ― a top Congolese virologist who treated the first known Ebola cases and helped work on a vaccine that was ignored until the virus hit the U.S. ― is still warning developed countries about overlooked diseases that are increasingly spreading.“These neglected diseases can become a threat to developed countries,” Muyembe said. “With travel and everything we have now, the world has become a village.”“Everything comes from animals,” he added, “and [Congo’s] ecology is one that favors the emergence of these new diseases.” While smallpox could be eradicated because it only existed in humans, “monkeypox probably has 10 or so animal reservoirs,” Laudisoit said. “So we need a vaccine, because we can’t exactly kill all the animals.”This year, the CDC, in partnership with the Kinshasa School of Public Health and Congo’s Ministry of Health, started trials with an injectable vaccine on some 1,000 Congolese health workers in Tshuapa province and some lab workers in the capital.“Our big push now is trying to get health care workers protected against this,” said Benjamin Monroe, a monkeypox specialist at the CDC.Monroe has seen a resurgence of monkeypox cases in the last couple of years, citing Sierra Leone and the Central African Republic as examples of where more cases are being reported. But he’s not worried about a global pandemic.“I don’t think monkeypox will become a mutant, rampant virus and take over the world,” he said. “And if it were to, we already have strategies and vaccines from eradicating smallpox. You can pull out that playbook, dust it off and do it again if you had to.” But rolling out a new and expensive monkeypox vaccine to all those at risk would require serious international funding for something that’s considered a disease of poverty, Monroe noted.“Incredibly poor people who are forced into the forest to subsist on what they can are the people we see getting these diseases,” he said.And Laudisoit sees little hope on the horizon for them.“For as long as there’s not a white person who has monkeypox ― with spots like in the ’60s from smallpox ― there will be a lack of money,” she said. “I assure you that when that happens, within three days, there will be funding, and that’s true for all neglected diseases.”This series is supported, in part, by funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

Monkeypox was traced back to this country in 1970.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59ca727c1900004e5d565b37.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"This article is part of HuffPost’s Project Zero campaign, a yearlong series on neglected tropical diseases and efforts to fight them.KISANGANI, Congo ― To save people from a deadly smallpox-like virus that appears on the United States bioterrorism list and once spread from the African bush to the American Midwest, Dr. Anne Laudisoit spends much of her time scaling tall trees in Congolese forests to spy on squirrels.The 38-year-old biologist also dissects deceased rats, bats and antelopes, and meets people covered in pustulous rashes ― all in the hope of tracing the main animal culprits spreading monkeypox, a painful and contagious virus that has no vaccine and is not well understood.“That’s my work, finding the reservoir or reservoirs of this virus,” said Laudisoit, who grew up in a small village in Belgium and came to Congo in 2004 to track plague-carrying rats.For the past seven years, Laudisoit’s team has traveled huge distances on their mission to identify more than a dozen possible monkeypox carriers. They track critters. They track infected people. If a bushmeat hunter kills an animal and the carcass tests positive for monkeypox, Laudisoit’s team is on it.“I’m not afraid ― you just need to be careful where you work,” she said, standing among frames of squashed squirrels, stuffed rodents and monkey skulls at the Centre for Biodiversity at the University of Kisangani, in the Democratic Republic of Congo’s third largest city.But when a virus is so overlooked that it doesn’t even appear on the World Health Organization’s list of neglected diseases, trying to raise awareness means visiting areas where few Westerners have come before ― except to plunder resources.“If you’re a white person and you come sailing down the river in a dugout canoe for four days and trekking through the forest, people think you’re coming for diamonds and gold,” Laudisoit said.Far from seeking Congo’s riches, she is looking for the origin of monkeypox. The disease was named in 1958 after it was discovered in laboratory monkeys brought from Asia to Denmark, but it originated in the forests that Laudisoit now roams.Monkeypox was traced to Congo in 1970, when it was first found in humans. It initially causes fever, headache, muscle aches and exhaustion, and later painful lesions that blister, scab and can cause fatal infections usually from septicemia, especially in people with weak immune systems.The virus is now known to be found in remote tropical rainforests and in 10 or so west and central African countries. And it could be spreading on the back of one of mankind’s greatest public health successes ― the eradication of smallpox.In 1980, after some 3,000 years and hundreds of millions of deaths, the world celebrated the global eradication of smallpox, a virus with a 30 percent mortality rate. It was, and remains, the only human infectious disease to be wiped from the planet. But that achievement also meant an end to smallpox inoculations.In Congo, home to more than 80 million people, the loss of the smallpox vaccine ― which provides up to 85 percent immunity against monkeypox ― has led to “an increase in cases, primarily among young people, because the herd immunity is going down,” Laudisoit said.According to Laudisoit, there were just under 50 cases of monkeypox in the 1970s. Now, some areas report more than 250 cases each year. And it’s not an isolated problem. Of the total 516 health zones that Congo’s Ministry of Health monitors, 216 have reported at least one case of monkeypox.“Almost half a country that is four times as big as France is at risk of developing a disease like smallpox,” she said.Laudisoit often goes to events held by international health organizations to share her knowledge and concerns about monkeypox. She says she sees the same apathy toward this virus as there once was toward Ebola, which was discovered in Congo in the 1970s.“They don’t care about black people dying in the bush,” Laudisoit said. “They knew about Zika for 70 years in Uganda ― but when it affects Olympic Games and golfers, then they care.”“At conferences, I ask, ‘If a place as big as France, Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands combined had a case of something like smallpox, wouldn’t we have already reacted and already revaccinated people?’ You’ve got to ask, because that’s exactly what’s happening here.”Research into monkeypox is so minimal that Laudisoit’s team ― going village to village to record cases and train medics in how to identify the rash ― has cast doubt on existing data. For instance, the World Health Organization estimates that the virus kills between 1 and 10 percent of victims during an outbreak. But Laudisoit and her team have documented mortality rates that are much higher.“The figures are completely obsolete because there are no recent studies,” she said. “Last year, I investigated an epidemic. We went to a village where there were 61 cases, and 12 deaths” ― almost double the stated mortality rate.There had been little interest in funding research and vaccines for monkeypox until a 2003 outbreak in the U.S. caused by African giant pouched rats imported from Ghana to Texas.The virus spread from the rats to native prairie dogs at an Illinois pet dealership to more than 70 people across Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, Missouri, Kansas and Ohio.No one died from these first human monkeypox infections outside Africa, and the virus was quickly contained.But ”it could have been a different story,” Laudisoit thinks, had the U.S. been hit by the much more virulent Central African strain, which comes from Congo and which, unlike its West African cousin, can kill humans.Still, the outbreak resulted in the U.S. tightening restrictions on animals imported from Africa.

It was delicious, and in a week or two I’ll explain how I made it, even though I don’t have any pretty pictures to prove that it actually existed. One element of that tart was celery root (celeriac). I’d cut it into thick slabs – three per medium-sized celery root – and braised/steamed it in a covered pan with butter, a little water and a very little lemon juice until tender but not without texture. To form a layer of the tart filling, I’d then cut each slab into thinner slices; a few of these were left over and stored in the fridge. Several days later, it really was time to eat them: we were doing our best not to have too much leftover food in the house when we departed for a two-week trip. They could have been part of a rice dish – either a risotto or something paella-like – or they could have become a filling for ravioli, a particularly appealing idea.When push came to shove, however, I simply didn’t feel like making, rolling and filling pasta, but did want something Italianate that would be nice with butter, sage and cheese or a light tomato sauce (we also had to use the ripe tomatoes that were softening by the minute), and I thought back to gnocchi I’d made using vegetables other than potatoes, notably winter squash. One fine thing about these is the trueness of their flavor: adding egg, flour and sometimes cheese does little to dilute the vegetable’s nature. Since celery root has one of the best flavors in the autumn market, these gnocchi would surely be terrific. And, as it turned out, they were.I made a very small batch, dictated by the quantity of leftover celery root; it was enough for the two of us as a light main course (following some other leftovers). Quantities could easily be doubled or tripled for a dinner with guests. (They are certainly guest-worthy.)I began by food-processing 5 ounces (145 g) celery root cooked as described above with 3 tablespoons (about an ounce or 30 g) of grated parmesan. For a more powerful flavor you could substitute pecorino. Still using the food processor, I added 3 or 4 leaves of fresh sage and pureed until the sage was very finely chopped. You could substitute a small handful of parsley. I then incorporated one egg yolk and transferred the mixture to a bowl, where I used a rubber spatula to beat in 1/4 cup (1 oz or 30 g) flour to yield a mixture that was soft and a little moist, but that held together well and did not sag when I used a spoon to form the dumplings.It is prudent at this stage to poach a teaspoonful of the mixture for two and a half minutes in salted water to make sure it needs no further seasoning: the celery root will have been seasoned when it was cooked, and the cheese adds salt too. In the event, my mixture was fine as it was – there was just enough salt, and pepper would have been a distraction.You can keep this in the fridge, well covered, for a few hours, and probably overnight. Use a spoon dipped in water to form odd-shaped (or perfectly shaped if you insist) ovoids or spheroids about 1 tablespoon in volume, and deposit them onto a wet plate, then use a knife or spatula to quickly push them into the water one by one - they’ll slip right off the plate if it’s nice and wet. You can also slide them right from the wet spoon into the boiling water, but you’ll need to work fast to minimize the time lag between the first and the last gnocchi.We ate ours with butter and sage. A light fresh tomato sauce would have been good too, but not as good. In either case, finish with a sprinkle of the same cheese you used in the mixture.We got all the flavor of celery root in a lovely plate of light, tender gnocchi. And we were one step further toward a refrigerator emptied of leftovers. Which is not to say you can’t make these from scratch, as we will certainly do before too long."

Subsequent analysis of data transmissions led investigators to believe it had crashed off Australia’s west coast. “It is almost inconceivable and certainly societally unacceptable in the modern aviation era ... for a large commercial aircraft to be missing and for the world not to know with certainty what became of the aircraft and those on board,” the Australian Transport Safety Bureau said in its final 440-page report, published Tuesday.Australia, China and Malaysia conducted a massive $160 million hunt for the aircraft above and underwater ― the largest search in aviation history ― that continued for more than 1,000 days before it was called off in January of this year. Australia led the underwater portion of the search, which scoured about 120,000 square kilometers of the Indian Ocean floor.“This is one of the world’s greatest tragedies, and we so wish that we had been able to recover this aircraft and those that lost their lives on board,” Greg Hood, the ATSB chief commissioner, said Tuesday.Twelve crew members and 227 passengers from 15 countries were aboard the doomed flight.In 2015 and 2016, debris from MH370 was discovered in the Indian Ocean and along the east African coastline, but the rest of the plane’s whereabouts remain unknown. The Malaysian government will continue its investigation.“Despite the extraordinary efforts of hundreds of people involved in the search from around the world, the aircraft has not been located,” the ATSB report concluded. “The reasons for the loss of MH370 cannot be established with certainty until the aircraft is found.”Although unsuccessful, the search has shed some light on the mystery. “The understanding of where MH370 may be located is better now than it has ever been,” said the report, noting that the deep sea hunt “eliminated most of the high probability areas.” It also yielded valuable lessons for planes crossing deep oceans. Flight tracking systems will continue to be enhanced, according to the report, and steps are underway to improve emergency locator transponders, flight recorder locator beacons and other aircraft systems.

Sadly, this piece is as relevant now as then.We Americans do grief well.When senseless and often random acts of violence occur — such as the massacre of at least 59 people at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas Sunday night — we trot out the usual public panoply of grief.Somewhere, someone rouses the bagpipes to play “Amazing Grace.” We hold prayer and candlelight vigils in public places. We mourn publicly in our churches, synagogues, and mosques. We place pictures of the slain in public places, ringed by flowers and lit candles. We hold moments of silence for the victims. We cross arms, hold hands, and sing “We Shall Overcome.” The funerals become public vehicles for displays of grief. The media shows up; the president — or someone he deputizes — often attends, saying the appropriate words to express a nation’s shock, sadness, and often dismay or anger.Grieving is, of course, the way humans come to terms with loss. Grieving is appropriate, cathartic and healthy, and no one would or should deny those who suffered serious loss the right to grieve in whatever way helps the process of healing.No, there is nothing wrong with grief — except when ritualized public grieving is all we do, when public displays of grief become a substitute for action.Run down the list of massacres in recent years: 1999, Columbine, Colorado, two teenagers shoot and kill 13 people at the local high school; that same year, a gunman opens fire on a Christian rock concert in Fort Worth, Texas, killing seven; 2003, a Lockheed Martin employee shoots up his plant in Meridian, Mississippi, killing seven; 2005, a teenager in Red Lake, Minnesota, kills his grandfather and his grandfather’s girlfriend, then opens fire at the local high school, killing seven more people; 2007, 32 people killed by gunfire at Virginia Tech; 2009, a psychiatrist at Fort Hood army base in Texas shoots and kills 13 and wounds 29; 2011, six people die and then-Representative Gabby Giffords is shot in the head by a gunman in Tucson, Arizona; 2012, 12 people killed in a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, by a gunman wielding multiple firearms; later that year, 20 children and six adults killed by gunfire at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut; 2013, a gunman fatally shoots 12 at the Washington, D.C., Navy Yard; 2015, a gunman murders nine people at historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina; that same year, 14 people killed in an attack in San Bernardino, California; 2016, a gunman opens fire in a crowded nightclub in Orlando, Florida, killing 49; now, Las Vegas, Nevada, the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history.This is a partial list, but every tragedy on it — and the others not listed — have three things in common: First, the perpetrators used guns; second, we had the usual displays of public grief; and third, after much hand wringing and “thoughts and prayers,” we did nothing.There is no reason to think our response will be any different this time. “It is positively infuriating that my colleagues in Congress are so afraid of the gun industry that they pretend there aren’t public policy responses to this epidemic. There are, and the thoughts and prayers of politicians are cruelly hollow if they are paired with continued legislative indifference. It’s time for Congress to get off its ass and do something,” said Connecticut Democratic Senator Chris Murphy in response to the Las Vegas shooting.Infuriating, but almost certainly Congress will do nothing. President Donald Trump, who has often jumped to conclusions absent facts, muted his response to Las Vegas. Initially, he tweeted, “My warmest condolences and sympathies to the victims and families of the terrible Las Vegas shooting. God bless you!” Later, he delivered somber and largely apolitical remarks, calling the massacre, “An act of pure evil.” But, the only action the president took was to order American flags to be flown at half-staff. Unlike his predecessor, Trump did not call for further controls on guns.We do not know, of course, how many lives, if any, would have been saved if the country had tougher gun control laws. But logic dictates that banning, at the least, assault weapons saves lives. There is the example of Australia for guidance. In 1996, a gunman killed 35 people in Tasmania. Australia responded by banning semiautomatic and automatic weapons, and the nation instituted a mandatory buy-back program for the banned guns. Since then, the firearm homicide rate has fallen by 59 percent and the firearm suicide rate by 65 percent, without a parallel increase in non-firearm homicides and suicides. And since then, there have been no gun-related massacres similar to Sandy Hook or Las Vegas. The United States is not Australia. But, President Barack Obama was right when he said after Charleston, “This type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries.” The families and friends of the victims in Las Vegas need to grieve. It is right, proper, and healthy. As for the rest of us, our public grief should not become an excuse, once again, to do nothing. It is time to act! It will be difficult, but it could show not only the world, but ourselves, that we Americans can move beyond grieving."

Puigdemont has also called for international mediation in the region’s dispute with Madrid.Catalonia, Spain’s wealthiest region, wedged in the northeast on the Mediterranean coast below the mountainous border with France, has its own language and culture, and a growing minority there has nurtured hopes of independence for years. Madrid says the constitution prohibits secession and can only be changed if all Spaniards, not just Catalans, agree.Catalonia is a center of industry and tourism accounting for a fifth of Spain’s economy. Although it has extensive autonomy, its tax revenues are crucial to Spain’s state budget.Spanish stocks remained under pressure and the cost of insuring exposure to Spanish sovereign debt rose to a near five-month high, with many economists and investors anticipating an escalation of tensions in the short term.Thousands of people took part in marches and protests in Barcelona, the regional capital, on Tuesday.A big crowd gathered outside the local headquarters of Spain’s ruling Popular Party. Catalan firefighters in their orange jackets and yellow helmets, who have assumed a role as mediators between demonstrators and police, stood between the crowd and police.“In no way can we accept that they come here with this kind of repression,” taxi driver Alejandro Torralbo, 64, said of Sunday’s police action.“They can’t do this. What happened on Oct. 1 has fired up independence feeling that will never die,” said another demonstrator, 18-year-old student Monica Ventinc.“PEACEFUL PEOPLE”Normally busy metro stations in Barcelona were deserted as services were cut back sharply, pickets blocked traffic on Gran Via street and traffic on six major highways in the region was disrupted by protests.Protesters used a large truck to block a highway in El Masnou near Barcelona, painted “general strike” on a road sign and put up a banner reading “Not one step back.”“Today is a day of democratic, civic and dignified protest. Don’t let yourselves be carried away by provocations. The world has seen that we are peaceful people,” Puigdemont said on Twitter on Tuesday.Elsewhere in Barcelona, the response to the strike call was patchy with some shops, supermarkets and cafes open and some closed. The Boqueria market in the city was almost empty.With 95 percent of the vote counted, authorities said the “Yes” vote stood at 90.1 percent, on a turnout of 2.26 million of 5.34 million registered voters.The Catalan government said almost 900 people were injured when Spanish police forcibly tried to close polling stations.Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has defended the police action and said more than 400 police officers needed medical attention.Scenes of armored Spanish police swinging truncheons and firing rubber bullets at peaceful voters have been widely condemned, with the European Union calling for talks to break the stalemate between Madrid and Barcelona.On Sunday, Rajoy said the ballot had failed, while Puigdemont vowed to continue with the independence process.“MAFIA-LIKE BEHAVIOUR”Spain’s two largest unions, the UGT and CCOO, said on Monday their affiliates in Cataloniawould not take part in the general strike, but would support protests.Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said police had told her they had been forced to leave one Catalan town after the local council threatened to exclude them from the hotels where they were staying.“We aren’t going to tolerate mafia-like behavior from the town councils of Catalonia,” she said.Many services under the control of the Catalan government saw some stoppages, with public transport running at around 40 percent, according to reports, while port workers and civil servants also walked out. Entrances to some government offices were blocked by crowds protesting in favor of independence.In the small Catalan town of Vic, a bastion of independence, every shop, bar and cafe was closed in the town of 40,000 people and stalls were draped with Catalan flags, which also hung from most balconies.A giant “yes” banner hung in the main square, where people were congregating.

Gun stocks soared in the hours after Stephen Paddock on Sunday night shot and killed at least 58 people and wounded over 500 others at a country music festival in Las Vegas, Nevada.Republicans leaders in Congress offered “thoughts and prayers” for the victims but no concrete calls to action. President Donald Trump didn’t mention guns at all in his responses to the shooting. The National Rifle Association spent more than $30 million to help Trump win the election.House Republicans have also been working to advance SHARE Act, a bill that would make it easier for people to buy gun silencers without a background check, according to John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety.Some Democratic lawmakers, meanwhile, were incredulous at the lack of action.“The thoughts and prayers of politicians are cruelly hollow if they are paired with continued legislative indifference,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who has been a gun control advocate since the Sandy Hook massacre shook his state in 2012, said in a statement. “It’s time for Congress to get off its ass and do something.”It’s not just Congress that’s split on gun control. A June HuffPost/YouGov poll found that Democrats were far more likely to consider gun violence a serious issue and to support stricter gun laws."
69,POLITICS,Progressive Groups Invoke Trump In New Push For Surveillance Reform,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/progressive-groups-trump-surveillance_us_59d3aeb4e4b065578155a4cd,A letter to Democratic members of Congress aims to make government spying an issue for future presidential candidates.,2017-10-03,Progressive organizations believe wariness of Attorney General Jeff Session and President Donald Trump could solidify Democratic support for major surveillance reform.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59d3b03e200000f815084d80.jpeg?cache=1KaYCnswjk&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Leading progressive organizations hope to turn the reform of government surveillance programs into a litmus test for 2020 presidential candidates.In a letter to congressional Democrats, 34 groups, led by the digital rights-focused Demand Progress Action, demand new protections for civil liberties in the reauthorization of a key surveillance law. The groups favor allowing the expiration of Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which enables the federal government to search the electronic communications of Americans without a warrant.Given the political difficulty of such a goal, however, the groups are trying to leverage Democrats’ fear of overreach by President Donald Trump to unite the party behind a more limited, but nonetheless sweeping, set of reforms aimed at preventing surveillance of Americans without a warrant.“The Trump administration has made no secret of its desire to criminalize people of color and activists,” the letter says. “No Democrat should support a law that grants Trump the ability to spy — without a court-issued warrant — on the more than 325 million people that live in this country.”Section 702, which Congress added to FISA in 2008, allows the attorney general and director of national intelligence to order the surveillance of non-Americans “reasonably believed to be located outside the United States” for the collection of foreign intelligence information.The provision is the legal basis for two digital data collection programs revealed by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden in June 2013. The NSA uses its Prism program to collect data from Google, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft that is sent to or from a foreigner targeted for national security or intelligence reasons, and its “upstream” collection picks up communications from the international fiber-optic cables that transport phone and internet data across borders.The law limits data collection to foreigners not on United States soil, but it places no such limits on searching already-collected data. As a result, civil liberties groups say, the provision has been used to create a “back-door” search mechanism granting the government access to data involving U.S. citizens, green-card holders, and foreigners living in the U.S. who corresponded with a targeted foreigner.Until April, the NSA’s Upstream program had been collecting data on Americans’ whose electronic communications contained the contact information of a targeted foreigner, even if a foreigner targeted for security or intelligence purposes was not involved in the correspondence. That tactic is known as “about” collection.The NSA discontinued the practice after it could not find a way to maintain it and remain in compliance with FISA court rules permitting the Upstream program.But were it not for Snowden’s leaks, civil liberties advocates noted, the “about” searching would never have been discovered and stopped. (Snowden argued on Twitter that the cessation of the practice would be “the most substantive of the post-2013 NSA reforms, if the principle is applied to all other programs.”)For Demand Progress Action ― and allies on the letter, including the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, Color of Change, and Credo ― the exposure shows that FISA courts alone are not enough to ensure that the federal government respects the constitutional right to privacy enshrined in the Fourth Amendment. Demand Progress Action’s policy arm documented numerous other violations of FISA rules in a September report, making the case that FISA courts have proven incapable of deterring intelligence agency abuses under Section 702.Section 702 has “grown into a tool so powerful that it is changing the way innocent people speak and associate,” the letter says.Left unchecked, the federal government, particularly under Trump’s leadership, is liable to abuse its powers in even more pernicious ways, the letter says. It points to intelligence agencies’ historic use of mass surveillance to engage in political persecution against Martin Luther King Jr. and other progressive leaders as an indication of what is possible.“Surveillance has always been justified on the back of national security concerns, even though on many occasions it has been employed to counter progressive reform movements, and it invariably disproportionately targets communities of color and people working for social change,” the letter says.The progressive organizations propose far-reaching reforms. They want Congress to write into the law the NSA’s cessation of “about” searches in which neither correspondent is a foreigner based in a different country. Further, they would have Congress explicitly forbid the federal government from accessing the data of U.S. citizens, green-card holders and foreigners living in the United States without a court-issued warrant.Additionally, they are pressing Congress to force the NSA to disclose how much data it has collected on American citizens, green-card holders and foreigners on U.S. soil, and require the Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel to explain how it is interpreting Section 702.The groups are also seeking to revise a procedure known as “parallel construction,” in which the government uses secretly collected information against defendants without disclosing to them or courts the origin of the evidence. The practice prevents Americans and foreigners living in the U.S. from challenging evidence prosecutors launder from national security-related searches and later share with other law enforcement authorities. Finally, the progressive groups are trying to limit the re-authorization of the FISA Act to a single year “so that Congress and the public have the opportunity to re-examine how (and if) the Trump-run surveillance agencies operate under the framework it enshrines.”Even under President Barack Obama, civil libertarians had limited success curtailing the authority of the NSA and other intelligence agencies, thanks to post-9/11 laws expanding their powers.A June 2015 reform entitled the USA Freedom Act transferred the storage of phone data previously held by the NSA to phone companies and required the federal government to petition a federal court to search the cache.But civil liberties groups, including Demand Progress Action, considered the measure a fig leaf for real reform, arguing that the NSA’s practice of searching personal data on tens of millions of Americans would continue through a different process. In December 2012, prior to Snowden’s revelations, Congress quietly renewed the 2008 amendments to the FISA Act for five years. Support for substantial reform of the FISA Act has grown stronger in libertarian wings of both parties, but political backing for the status quo has proven resilient. A bipartisan amendment to the annual defense spending bill that would have barred the NSA from using federal dollars to conduct back-door searches on Americans’ data passed the House twice in 2014 and 2015, before being stripped out in the Senate. In June 2016, following the massacre at the Orlando nightclub, the House defeated the amendment by a narrow margin.Ahead of the December deadline for reauthorization of the FISA Act, the prospects for deep reforms of the kind advocated by organizations like Demand Progress Action and libertarian conservative outfits like FreedomWorks has grown more remote ― not least because of the Trump administration’s hostility to those efforts. A White House official said in March that the administration supports a “clean reauthorization” free from reforms aimed at buttressing privacy rights.Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, FBI Director Chris Wray and NSA Director Michael Rogers are likely to make their views known in a classified briefing on Section 702 for members of Congress on Wednesday.Meanwhile, a group of hawkish Senate Republicans led by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) introduced a bill in June that would permanently reauthorize Section 702.David Segal, executive director of Demand Progress Action, said the group’s effort aims to consolidate Democratic support for reform.“There is a broad set of Democratic activists and voters who are very concerned about affording these sorts of powers to Trump,” Segal said. “They’ll be watching how everybody votes on this issue with particular attention to people running for president ― Sens. Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand, Corey Booker and others ― when they consider who has the interests of communities that comprise the Democratic Party in mind.”Democrats who may have been less sensitive to those concerns under the Obama administration might reconsider now that Trump is president, according to Segal.“Because they trusted Obama, they helped erect surveillance structures that amount to a turnkey tyranny that Donald Trump can steward,” Segal said. “There’s now an understanding of the danger of having people like Trump and Jeff Sessions having control over these extraordinary powers.”"

When police breached his room at the Mandalay Bay hotel, they said they found Paddock dead of an apparent self-inflicted wound. He had at least 10 guns, they added.Some hours after his tweet Monday morning, Trump read prepared remarks from the White House, called the shooting “an act of pure evil” and commended first responders and local officials.He also offered his prayers and announced that he plans to visit Las Vegas on Wednesday.“Melania and I are praying for every American who has been hurt, wounded or lost the ones they loved so dearly in this terrible, terrible attack,” he said. “We pray for the entire nation to find unity and peace, and we pray for the day when evil is banished, and the innocent are safe from hatred and from fear.”Not mentioned in statements from Trump and the White House: the issue of guns.When asked at Monday’s White House press briefing whether Trump would consider gun reforms in response to the shooting, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said it was not appropriate to discuss the matter.“There’s a time and place for a political debate, but now is the time to unite as a country,” Sanders said, before offering her “thoughts and prayers.”She also said it was “premature to discuss policy when we don’t know all of the facts.”Yet in the past, Trump has speculated on the motives for violence before any official information was confirmed. He decried the explosion at a London tube station last month as the work of a “loser terrorist” and used the attack to promote his own travel ban on Muslim-majority countries.At other times, the president has been conspicuously silent in the face of atrocity. He condemned “many sides” in the Charlottesville, Virginia, white supremacist rally in August that killed a counter-protester. Two days later, he denounced racism. But in the days that followed, he returned to blaming the white supremacists and counter-protesters equally for the violence. At Monday’s press briefing, Sanders repeatedly dodged questions on why Trump had previously weighed in on gun violence without knowing all of the facts ― like in 2016, when he hastily responded to the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, by promoting his then-only-proposed travel ban.Sanders argued the situation was different because Trump was merely a presidential candidate at the time.“There is a difference between being a candidate and being a president,” she said. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story wrongly reported that Trump didn’t immediately respond to the Charlottesville violence. This story has been updated with Trump’s remarks Monday morning and Sanders’ remarks Monday afternoon."

At least 58 people died and over 500 were injured at the Route 91 Harvest festival when Stephen Paddock, 64, fired on a crowd of 22,000 concertgoers from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel. “I cannot express how wrong I was,” Keeter wrote in a note posted to Twitter on Monday. Although the band and its crew had access to firearms of their own, the guitarist said they were “useless” during the shooting, since they could have added to the confusion and terror at the scene. Keeter said the feeling of reaching out to loved ones during the attack made him realize the issue of gun control “is completely and totally out of hand.”“These rounds were powerful enough that my crew guys just standing in close proximity of a victim shot by this fucking coward received shrapnel wounds,” Keeter recalled.He continued: “We need gun control RIGHT. NOW.”The band began their performance on the festival’s main stage at 4 p.m. local time, around six hours before the shooting began during a performance by Jason Aldean on the same stage. Singers Luke Combs and Jake Owen had just taken a nearby stage when they heard gunfire, which created “chaos” that felt “like a movie,” Owen told the “Today” show.Las Vegas authorities stated that Paddock, who was found dead at the scene, had “in excess of 10 rifles” in his hotel room. Nevada is considered to have some of the most permissive gun control laws in the nation. Advocates for gun law reform began speaking out soon after the tragedy. Monday morning, Hillary Clinton slammed a bill in the House that would loosen U.S. gun control laws in a win for the NRA, if passed. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who became a vocal gun control advocate after the Sandy Hook Elementary attack in his home state, also issued a statement lambasting his colleagues in Congress for being “so afraid of the gun industry that they pretend there aren’t public policy responses to this epidemic.”“Our band and crew will never forget how that moment made them feel,” frontman Josh Abbott wrote in a tweet of his own.Read Keeter’s full note below: I’ve been a proponent of the 2nd amendment my entire life.A representative for the Josh Abbott Band declined HuffPost’s request for comment."

The 38-year-old politician, who was a member of Ontario’s provincial legislature, swept to the top of the left-wing party with about 53.8 percent of the vote, the National Post reported.  His closest rival in the race, a politician from Ontario named Charlie Angus, fell far behind, with only 19.4 percent of the vote.Singh, the son of Indian immigrants, spoke to The Toronto Star about how he hopes his historic victory will “inspire a whole host of new leaders across the country, people who never saw themselves represented in positions of power.” The politician will face Canada’s current prime minister Justin Trudeau in the country’s 2019 elections. Singh was born in Scarborough, Canada in 1979, to parents who immigrated from Punjab, India. His father, who was a trained physician in India, attended medical school in Canada while working as a security guard to pay the bills. His mother worked at a bank. In an interview with HuffPost Canada earlier this year, Singh spoke about how he was bullied by both adults and kids who made fun of his name and his Sikh identity. “Kids would say: ‘You’re dirty, your skin is dirty, why don’t you take a shower’ ... or ‘You’re not a boy, you’re a girl because you have long hair,’ and then they would just come up and pull my hair, or just punch me.”On Sunday, Singh’s life story came full circle. As he gave his acceptance speech, he was surrounded by a room full of supporters chanting his name. “And you all pronounced it right too, thank you for that,” he said. Singh has made addressing income inequality, affordable housing, climate change, and reconciliation with Indigenous tribes some of his primary goals. He also promised to works towards ending the racial profiling of minorities by police. “Growing up with brown skin, long hair and a funny sounding name meant I faced some challenges. I’ve been stalked by the police multiple times for no other reason than the color of my skin,” Singh said during his acceptance speech on Sunday. “It makes you feel like you don’t belong, like there’s something wrong with you for just being you. And that’s why as prime minister, I will make sure no one is stopped by the police because of the way they look or the color of their skin.”Earlier this year, Singh was confronted during an event by a heckler who accused him of supporting Shariah law, a complex, often-misunderstood set of Islamic principles. Instead of clarifying that he was Sikh, and not Muslim, Singh told the heckler that she was loved and welcomed. He’s been widely praised for how he handled the situation. Singh faces a number of challenges in the immediate future ― including uniting his party and cleaning up its finances. Singh also doesn’t have a seat in Canada’s House of Commons. Still, the NDP’s national director Robert Fox called Singh’s victory a “game-changer.”“There are so many Canadians who sort of feel that they’ve been on the outside looking in, and he has kicked the door open and said, ‘Come on in,’” Fox told the National Post. “And for young brown men and women, for people of colour, for Indigenous Canadians, it really gives them a sense of opportunity, of openness, of prospects in 2019.”"

74,BUSINESS,Starbucks Under Fire For Giving Less Parental Leave To Hourly Workers,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/starbucks-parental-leave_us_59cea755e4b05f005d3441f5,"""This is a moral issue.""",2017-10-02,A barista froths milk for a drink inside a Starbucks shop in New York. Shareholders of the company are criticizing how its employee benefits are different for hourly workers and salaried workers.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59cece252d00007c08307ecf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Why does Starbucks think it’s OK to give its well-compensated salaried employees far better paid leave benefits than hourly workers who are already barely scraping by? On Monday, some of the company’s shareholders filed a resolution demanding an explanation.At issue is a new Starbucks maternity and paternity leave policy that went into effect over the weekend. The coffee giant now gives salaried workers ― some of whom make six-figure salaries ― 18 paid weeks off for maternity leave. Hourly workers, who earn around $10 an hour, get six weeks paid time off if they physically give birth to a baby. Hourly workers who adopt also get six weeks off fully paid. Men who work hourly and whose partners give birth get 12 weeks off without pay; men and adoptive parents who work in corporate also get 12 weeks, but fully paid.Adoptive parents and men who work hourly get 12 weeks off without pay; men and adoptive parents who work in corporate get the same amount of time, but fully paid. The company has around 180,000 U.S. employees and the vast majority work in the stores, meaning the generous leave policy effectively goes to only a privileged minority.“This is a discrimination claim just waiting to happen,” said Pat Miguel Tomaino, associate director of socially responsible investing at Zevin Asset Management in Boston, the lead filer on the shareholder resolution, with four other social impact investors including Reynders McVeigh Capital Management, Arjuna Capital, Pax World Management and Friends Fiduciary Corporation. Not only is Starbucks’ reputation as a progressive company at risk, Tomaino said: “It’s a moral issue.”In an email, Starbucks spokesperson Jaime Riley emphasized the company offers extremely generous benefits to hourly employees who work 20 hours or more a week including health care, a stock plan, free college tuition and 401(k) matching. The company’s parental leave benefits are “exceptional” in the retail industry, Riley said. Indeed, only 14 percent of private sector employers have access to paid parental leave.When HuffPost asked how Starbucks squared the inequality between hourly worker and corporate parental benefits, Riley said, “That’s an interesting phrasing of that question.” She added that the company takes “a competitive approach and provide[s] benefits based on what our partners express as their needs and preferences.”Jess Svabinek, a 38-year-old barista at a Starbucks about 40 miles away from Seattle who makes $11.05 an hour, is out on unpaid leave now with her baby boy and certainly would have preferred more paid time off. “I can’t even grasp having to go back to work after just six weeks,” she told HuffPost. “I’m nine weeks out from a C-section and I couldn’t imagine getting up at 2 in the morning for the morning shift and leaving the baby. That’s when we’re up nursing.”Svabinek, who had her baby before the new policy went into effect, was able to take 8 weeks off at 67 percent of her regular pay. She is relying on her husband, who makes $20 an hour at Trader Joe’s, to get by on leave for as long as possible. She figures she’ll be back to work in January, if she can swing it financially. Already, her husband has put off some much-needed dental work to make everything possible.Starbucks is hardly the only retailer to offer better benefits to higher paid workers. Walmart gives women in its corporate office 12 weeks of paid maternity leave while its hourly workers get none, according to data compiled by Paid Leave U.S., a nonprofit advocacy group that also worked on Monday’s Starbucks proposal. Yum Brands, Taco Bell’s parent company, only gives paid leave to corporate full-timers; not to workers in its fast food restaurants. Other companies, including Ikea and Bank of America, provide equal benefits to all workers. This kind of class-based discrimination is baked into how companies do business, paying different workers different salaries based on their desirability. No one would argue that there’s anything wrong with those salary differences. But the issue of paid leave is trickier. It’s hard to seriously claim that a baby deserves less time with his mom because she couldn’t get a fancy white-collar job.And the issue isn’t really one the private sector is ever going to solve on its own. The problem is the United States has left what is essentially a public policy issue in the hands of private companies that are accustomed to doling out unequal benefits to workers. The Starbucks shareholder proposal emphasizes that these corporate paid leave policies are significant because the United States is one of only a handful of countries in the world without any paid maternity leave policy, placing companies like Starbucks at the center of a critical national policy issue.Yet the shareholders aren’t looking to start some crazy revolution. The resolution asks that Starbucks’ board look into the paid leave disparity and produce a report evaluating the discrimination risks that might arise.Tomaino wouldn’t say how he’d like Starbucks’ policy to change. “It’s not our role to be prescriptive,” he said, adding that he’d just like the company to re-evaluate the policy with an eye toward fairness, employee morale and the risks of lawsuits.The investor groups say Starbucks’ leave policy is particularly disturbing because over the years the company has developed a reputation for treating its workers well and providing equal benefits to all employees. Starbucks was also an early supporter of gay marriage, yet LGBTQ hourly workers are particularly hurt by the lack of paid leave for adoptive parents. Those workers are far more likely than their straight counterparts to adopt or foster children.Activist investors have increasingly been pushing companies on social issues, most recently urging companies to report on gender and pay, with some success ― convincing a handful of major tech companies to make public information on their pay gaps.“Investors now are stepping forward,” said Tomaino, who hopes to replicate those successes when it comes to paid leave. The Starbucks resolution is the first of its kind, but expect more. Tomaino said his organization is also talking to 11 other major retailers, including Target, Amazon, Costco and Apple about their paid leave policies ― or lack thereof.The group is looking at the issue of unequal benefits, as well as cases in which the amount of leave offered is simply inadequate. Without paid leave, many women are forced out of the job market. Others are set back in their career paths, by taking less-demanding jobs, declining promotions or dropping back to part-time work with the arrival of a child. That means many parents wind up tapping public benefits like food stamps to get by when a baby arrives on the scene. The lack of paid leave is one major reason women in 2017 still make just 80 percent of what men earn on average, according to federal data, and that the U.S. lags other developed countries when it comes to the percentage of women in the labor force. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story said Starbucks did not offer paid leave to hourly workers who adopt children. In fact, the company provides them with six paid weeks off."
