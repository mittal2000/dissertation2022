John Lewis (D-Ga.) speaking at an event in Washington, D.C., in May. He announced on Thursday that he will not attend the opening of the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum this weekend. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a29a8dd1900003b00cca090.jpeg?cache=SQifV0vgpg&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) said Thursday that he will not attend the opening of the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum this weekend because President Donald Trump’s “attendance and hurtful policies are an insult to the people portrayed” in the museum.“After careful consideration and conversations with church leaders, elected officials, civil rights activists, and many citizens of our congressional districts, we have decided not to attend or participate in the opening of the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum,” Lewis, a hero of the civil rights movement, said in a statement.Lewis said the president’s “disparaging comments about women, the disabled, immigrants, and National Football League players disrespect the efforts” of civil rights leaders. “The struggles represented in this museum exemplify the truth of what really happened in Mississippi,” he added. “After President Trump departs, we encourage all Mississippians and Americans to visit this historic civil rights museum.”Lewis, 76, had previously told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that it would be “very difficult for me to be there and be on the same platform with [Trump].”“I think his presence would make a mockery of everything that people tried to do to redeem the soul of America and to make this country better,” Lewis said. The NAACP also said earlier this week that the organization did not want Trump to attend the museum opening. “President Trump’s statements and policies regarding the protection and enforcement of civil rights have been abysmal, and his attendance is an affront to the veterans of the civil rights movement,” Derrick Johnson, NAACP president and CEO, said in a statement. “He has created a commission to reinforce voter suppression, refused to denounce white supremacists, and overall, has created a racially hostile climate in this nation.”And Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) told The Boston Globe that he wouldn’t speak at the event because of Trump. “The civil rights marchers who are being honored would turn over in their grave knowing that somebody who’s stood for that stuff would be in attendance,” Thompson told the publication. “The question is, do I want to be associated with someone who is that narrow in focus.”"
1,POLITICS,Scott Pruitt's Plan To Outsource Part Of EPA Overhaul To Automaker Raises Concerns,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pruitt-toyota-partnership_us_5a29bbc7e4b069ec48abfce8,The announcement came one day after a Volkswagen executive was sentenced to prison for an emissions scandal.,2017-12-07,EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt testified before the House Energy and Commerce Committee about the mission of the agency on Dec. 7. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a29c0f71e000027000c2b25.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Environmental Protection Agency plans to work with Toyota Motor Corporation to overhaul internal management practices at the agency, Administrator Scott Pruitt said Thursday. The announcement came in response to a question from Rep. John Shimkus (R-Ill.) abou how the agency assessed its workload and determined how many people were necessary to meet its goals, at the first of two hearings before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on Thursday morning. The EPA’s Office of Inspector General issued a report back in September 2011 criticizing the agency for not conducting a comprehensive workload analysis in 20 years, and Shimkus asked whether Pruitt planned to address it. “We are actually partnering with Toyota to begin a lean process at the agency to evaluate management practices,” Pruitt said. “The agency for many years ― and this is something I found surprising ― has not measured outcomes consistently.” The extent of the proposed partnership is unclear, but the EPA told HuffPost it was considering bringing on the company to advise on ways to streamline the National Environmental Policy Act process across agencies. “EPA, in conjunction with other federal agencies, is working to deploy lean management practices that eliminate waste and deliver measurable results,” an EPA spokeswoman told HuffPost.The EPA has historically used the term “partner” to describe big companies it has worked with to save water and increase renewable energy use, but inviting a company regulated by the agency to alter internal practices appears to be “unprecedented,” according to Don Anair, deputy director of the clean vehicles program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, an EPA watchdog.“We’ve seen a pattern with this EPA cozying up to industry,” Anair told HuffPost. “This is a clear conflict of interest.” The announcement, made as a passing remark on Pruitt’s first appearance before a Congressional oversight committee since taking office, raises concerns over how a corporate giant the EPA regulates could wield influence over agency functions. Like other automakers and trade associations, Toyota has lobbied aggressively to weaken Obama-era fuel economy standards.“I don’t see anything wrong with learning from the private and public sectors from good management techniques,” Janet McCabe, the former acting assistant administrator at the EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation, told HuffPost. “But depending on how embedded in the organization they’re going to be, it could raise questions, since they are a regulated industry that’s interested in the substantive work of the agency.”Toyota spokeswoman Karen Nielsen confirmed that the company is considering working with the EPA, but said it has not yet reached an agreement. She declined to comment on what that relationship would entail, the information Toyota would have access to, or how much the EPA offered to pay the company for its services.“At this time, Toyota is in exploratory discussions with the EPA and nothing has been decided,” she wrote in an email to HuffPost. “We’re just exploring what a project would look like.”Toyota proselytizes its management practices, dubbed “The Toyota Way,” to many organizations, including hospitals and nonprofits, and bringing the company in to the EPA could be “a great idea,” said Michael Useem, a professor of management at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. The agency would likely create a memorandum of understanding barring Toyota from working on policy issues, he said. “But who knows in the end,” Useem said. The partnership marks what critics see as another instance of the EPA being overly friendly with industries whose pollution it’s supposed to police. Pruitt spent his early months meeting with oil, gas and mining companies while spurning environmental and public health advocates. The primary focus of his tenure so far has been eliminating regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit pollution and toxic pesticides.  “I don’t have any problem with looking to business for management models, assuming appropriate distance between management models from companies and their compliance obligations,” Stan Meiberg, a former acting deputy EPA administrator who spent 39 years at the agency, told HuffPost. “It is worth remembering that while efficient operations are worthwhile, government is not a business,” he added. “Efficiency at the expense of justice is not what democratic government is about.”The news came one day after a former Volkswagen executive was sentenced to seven years in prison for his role in the auto giant’s emissions cheating scandal. The EPA spearheaded the 2015 investigation into Volkswagen’s scheme to fit 482,000 vehicles sold in the United States with software to cheat on government tests for diesel pollution, in violation of the Clean Air Act. Toyota has invested heavily in hydrogen battery technology and electric vehicles in recent years. The EPA awarded the company for fuel efficiency measures in its auto hauling division in 2015 and energy-saving practices in its North American factories in 2010. But the world’s biggest carmaker has its own history of violating the Clean Air Act. In March 2003, the EPA reached a settlement with Toyota for failing to disclosure information about a faulty part that increased ozone pollution in 2.2 million vehicles sold in the U.S. As part of the agreement, Toyota spent $20 million to retrofit up to 3,000 diesel-powered vehicles, including school and municipal buses, with catalytic converters, filters and whole engines to reduce pollution. “Given recent events, not sure I would be taking management advice from an auto company,” Cynthia Giles, who led the EPA’s enforcement and compliance office during the Volkswagen investigation, told HuffPost by email on Thursday.This article was updated to include comments from Janet McCabe and Stan Meiberg.

The late singer reportedly cut daughter Katie Cassidy, who stars in a slew of superhero shows on the CW, out of his will, which was obtained this week by The Blast.Cassidy died in November at age 67, days after being hospitalized and experiencing organ failure.His last will and testament, which was filed in 2004, specifically requested that his various assets ― about $150,000 ― be given to his son, Beau, a musician who is now 26 years old. “It is my specific intent not to provide any benefits hereunder to Katherine Evelyn Cassidy and/or any descendant of Katherine Evelyn Cassidy,” the will reads. Remaining “music memorabilia” was designated to David Cassidy’s three half-siblings, according to The Blast. A representative for Cassidy did not immediately return HuffPost’s request for comment.While David was Katie’s biological father, she was raised by her mother, model Sherry Williams, and her stepfather, Richard Benedon.The two have had a difficult relationship over the years, with the former teen heartthrob revealing they were no longer in contact as recently as February 2017.“I wasn’t her father. I was her biological father but I didn’t raise her,” Cassidy told People at the time. “She has a completely different life.”“I’m proud of her,” he added. “She’s very talented. It’s hard for me to even accept how old she is now, like 30.”Katie did, however, make an appearance on a 2011 episode of “The Celebrity Apprentice” to support her father who competed on the reality TV series’ fourth season. Despite their ups and downs, the actress reportedly rushed to his bedside following his hospitalization and later paid tribute to her father in a moving tweet. “Words cant express the solace our family’s received from all the love & support during this trying time,” she wrote. “My father’s last words were ‘So much wasted time.’ This will be a daily reminder for me to share my gratitude with those I love as to never waste another minute… Thank you.”In June, the “Arrow” actress announced her engagement to boyfriend Matthew Rodgers during a romantic getaway to African island Mauritius."
3,POLITICS,House Votes Down Trump Impeachment Resolution,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/house-impeachment-donald-trump_us_5a28616be4b03ece02ffedd1,But 58 Democrats voted for impeachment.,2017-12-06,Fifty-eight House Democrats voted to move forward with impeachment of President Donald Trump despite party leaders urging them not to do so.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a2861e5190000be35034ec4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Fifty-eight House Democrats voted to advance the impeachment of President Donald Trump on Wednesday, in direct defiance of the pleas of House Democratic leaders earlier in the day.A vote to table the impeachment resolution was agreed to 368-58, with four Democrats voting just “present” and 126 other Democrats voting with Republicans to kill the resolution.It may seem like this was an overwhelming confirmation of Trump ― and it was, in the sense that no Republican voted to advance impeachment and more than two-thirds of Democrats joined their GOP colleagues ― but 58 Democratic votes is still a significant statement on impeachment.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) issued a joint statement just before the vote urging their Democratic colleagues to reject the impeachment resolution. They presented the vote as a distraction from efforts to kill the Republican tax bill, which is swiftly making its way through Congress, and they cited the special counsel’s investigation of Trump, as well as inquiries from congressional committees, to plead with Democrats to hold off.“Now is not the time,” Pelosi and Hoyer wrote.But the most progressive wing of the Democratic caucus, bolstered by a large number of Congressional Black Caucus members ― including the No. 3 Democrat, Assistant Democratic Leader Jim Clyburn (S.C.) ― ignored Pelosi and Hoyer and voted for impeachment.The resolution was introduced by CBC member Al Green (D-Texas), who was talked out of forcing an impeachment vote earlier in the year.Green, wearing an American flag tie, said his resolution wasn’t about Democrats or Republicans; it was about democracy, about “the fate of our republic.”“May everyone vote their conscience knowing that history will judge us all,” Green said.Rather than attacking Trump over issues like Russia, Green’s impeachment resolution hits Trump for race-baiting, bigotry, anti-Semitism, and a number of Trump’s comments, including his statements after the protests in Charlottesville, Virginia; comments against the governor of Puerto Rico; and even Trump’s crusade against NFL protests.By not bringing Russia into the matter, the resolution may just be a proxy for the general anger toward Trump in the Democratic base, and Green may have had an easier time arguing to his colleagues that his resolution should proceed.Despite Pelosi and Hoyer’s concerns that the impeachment resolution would simply become a cudgel to divide Democrats, the vote will likely help some Democratic members, particularly those in far-left districts.But the vote might not be without consequences. Unabashed liberal Rep. Jared Polis (D-Colo.) and more moderate Rep. Tim Walz (D-Minn.), who are both running for governor of their respective states, also voted to advance the impeachment process.Still, Green argued that civility from Democrats had prevented them from confronting Trump for too long.“In doing this, hatred disguised as acceptable political correctness has festered in our body politic and polluted our discourse to our detriment. It divides and damages the social fabric of our country in ways that obstruction of justice cannot. It causes unparalleled destruction to our society in the long- and short-term that will not easily heal,” Green wrote in a letter to his colleagues."
4,STYLE,Second Model Accuses Photographer Bruce Weber Of Sexual Harassment,Julia Brucculieri,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fashion-industry-sexual-assault_us_5a270a53e4b06007f6b57fb4,This is just the latest in a long history of alleged abuse in the fashion industry.,2017-12-06,Photographer Terry Richardson has been accused of sexual harassment by multiple women over the years.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a280c87140000f36fb6bc0a.jpeg?ops=crop_17_84_2983_2438%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"A second model has come forward to accuse fashion photographer Bruce Weber of sexual harassment.Last week, model Jason Boyce filed a lawsuit against Weber, claiming the photographer sexually harassed him in 2014. Another model, Mark Ricketson, on Tuesday detailed new allegations of sexual harassment against Weber at a press conference, standing alongside his lawyer Lisa Bloom and Boyce.Ricketson said Weber preyed on him during a 2005 shoot at the photographer’s Manhattan studio.“He told me I ‘looked tense’ and proceeded to press his thumb on my forehead,” Ricketson said. “He then took my hand and told me to ‘find the energy’ by guiding my hand and rubbing it on one of three places: my forehead, chest or my stomach.” He continued: “Each time the ‘energy’ in my stomach would get lower and lower until I had to navigate the remaining space left before having to touch myself. I felt ashamed and embarrassed.” Ricketson said that he acquiesced to Weber’s requests because he feared that if he didn’t, he would be blacklisted. Ricketson is unable to file a lawsuit, as the statute of limitations for sexual harassment in New York is three years, but may testify as a corroborating witness in Boyce’s case. Weber’s representatives did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.Weber is, however, already facing non-legal repercussions from the accusations: On Tuesday, Vanity Fair canceled a party to honor the photographer in Art Basel in Miami.Rumors of sexual misconduct within the fashion industry have been rampant for years, notably in regard to photographer Terry Richardson, who’s been accused of sexual harassment and assault by several women.In 2001, a model walked out of a photo shoot with the photographer after claiming “he wanted me to be completely naked and pretend to give one of the men a blow job, while he was also naked.” In 2010, model Jamie Peck alleged Richardson got naked on the set of a photo shoot and asked her to touch his penis after suggesting she let him play with her used tampon. And in 2014, a woman named Anna del Gaizo told Jezebel that Richardson “shoved his hardening dick into [her] face” in 2008.Richardson denied the accusations in a contributor piece for HuffPost in 2014.A few brands, such as shoe company Aldo and Target, as well as Vogue U.S., stopped working with Richardson after the 2014 accusations surfaced. Others in the industry, like Sky Ferreira and Tom Ford, have continued to come to his defense.And Richardson has remained in demand, shooting covers for various publications and brands, despite the questions surrounding his behavior. Only this year did Condé Nast International, Valentino and Bulgari say they would stop working with the photographer, who had a photo spread in Vogue Paris as recently as August.While some may think sexual misconduct is not an issue in fashion, one only has to look at Cameron Russell’s Instagram page to see the reality. Last month, the model began posting stories other models had shared with her, detailing their experiences with sexual harassment and/or assault.Sarah Ziff, the founder of Model Alliance and a former model, has long been vocal about the problem, which she discussed in her 2009 documentary “Picture Me.” Last month, she told Cosmopolitan, “Our safety and wellbeing has clearly and consistently come second to the business interests of industry figures with longstanding relationships with designers, editors, casting directors, executives, brands (and so on) — people who often wield great power and influence behind the scenes.”Supermodel Christy Turlington has also suggested that predatory behavior is widespread, telling WWD, “The industry is surrounded by predators who thrive on the constant rejection and loneliness so many of us have experienced at some point in our careers.”"

It’s the type of conspiracy theory popular in Facebook groups and Reddit forums that cater to fringe paranoia. But in this case, these ominous concerns are coming from Republican senators. They’re the latest salvo in a quixotic, yearslong battle the GOP has waged against the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), an agency Congress created in 2010 to streamline federal oversight of abusive banking practices. And the main target of this impassioned vitriol is a 34-year-old bureaucrat named Leandra English.English, according to interviews with several former colleagues, is, well ― she’s boring. Not dull. Plenty of people commended her energy and intellect. But someone who specializes in work that doesn’t demand a spotlight. After earning a master’s degree from the London School of Economics, she’s built a career as a Washington functionary, changing federal agencies every few years as new opportunities arose, distinguishing herself by working long hours and, as multiple people said, “keeping the trains running on time.” “At the bureau, she was known as somebody with no ego,” notes Patricia McCoy, former CFPB assistant director for mortgage markets. “Her talent in cutting through red tape was widely recognized.”“She worked later than probably anybody I know,” says Chris Vaeth, who spent five years at the CFPB, ultimately leading its Office of Community Affairs.English declined to comment for this story.The bulk of that work took place at the CFPB, where English started in 2010 and returned after separate stints at the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management. She worked on the transition team that put the nascent agency on its feet. As deputy director for external affairs, she was charged with such radical activities as outreach to community banks and the establishment of a consumer complaint system. She’s been deputy chief operations officer and deputy chief of staff. Prior to the election last year, she applied for a job as the bureau’s chief of staff, which she started in January.And she’s effective. The consumer complaint system works. Even bank lobbyists pressing for lighter regulation acknowledge some grudging admiration. “I like Leandra,” Consumer Bankers Association CEO Richard Hunt told American Banker. “I think she was a terrific chief of staff.”Then, on Nov. 24, English took a career risk that landed her name in the papers. When CFPB Director Richard Cordray resigned to run for office in Ohio, he named English deputy director. English accepted the nod, knowing it was a politically controversial appointment ― a deliberate attempt to prevent President Donald Trump from installing a loyalist hostile to the agency’s mission without at least going through the Senate confirmation process. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the 2010 law that established the agency, the deputy director becomes acting director whenever the director himself is “absent or unavailable.” English was, she believed, now in charge of the agency she had helped found.But the president was apparently unhappy with this reasoning. Over Thanksgiving weekend, he named his budget director, Mick Mulvaney, acting head of the CFPB. English sued, and the question of who is actually running the agency is now making its way through federal court.Mulvaney is ideologically hostile to the bureau. He once called it a “sick, sad” joke. At a news conference last Monday, he declared that it had been “trampling on capitalism.” This is rather feverish rhetoric to describe an agency that essentially guards against petty theft. Over the past six years, the CFPB has returned roughly $12 billion in ill-gotten gains from financial institutions to over 29 million consumers. For individual families, that can mean substantive relief ― hundreds, and in some cases, thousands of dollars over bogus charges or deceptive contracts. But it’s hardly a threat to American capitalism, which has grown from a $16 trillion annual enterprise the day the CFPB opened its doors to an over $17 trillion operation today. The agency’s most recent major enforcement action was a $100 million fine imposed against Wells Fargo for secretly creating millions of bank accounts for customers who had never asked for them. In Mulvaney’s installation, CFPB’s leadership saw an effort from the Trump administration to dismantle an organization they had constructed from scratch.English and her supporters are perfectly aware they may well lose their case. An early court ruling has already come down in Trump’s favor, and the CFPB’s own general counsel has issued a memo siding with Mulvaney, who says he would keep English as deputy director if he ultimately prevails. If Trump were simply better organized, he could sidestep the entire affair by just naming a full-time director and getting him or her confirmed by the Senate. But it’s hard to build things in Washington that genuinely work, and very easy to destroy them. To English and her allies, even a long-shot bid to postpone or mitigate the damage is better than a full surrender.That’s the not-so-secret reason Republicans expend so much venom on the CFPB. Though plenty of the CFPB’s enemies in the GOP have accepted robust campaign contributions from the financial sector, the agency poses a much more serious threat to conservative ideology than it does to any donor’s bottom line. The financial industry has been booking handsome profits throughout the CFPB’s existence ― the $12 billion it has had to give back didn’t put an end to big bonuses, or force any legitimate businesses to close up shop. The CFPB instead serves as a constant institutional reminder that government can ― if it relies on the right people ― actually get things done.And so the Republican attacks on English don’t accuse her of waste or incompetence or any of the other stock conservative objections to bureaucracy. They have instead portrayed her as a dangerous mastermind. “This rogue employee is trying to ... run the agency as an unaccountable fourth branch of government,” wrote nine GOP senators, including Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas) in a letter to Mulvaney.Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), meanwhile, penned a lengthy conspiratorial inquiry to Kathleen McGettigan, acting director of the Office of Personnel Management, accusing English of “burrowing” into the CFPB for political purposes. Johnson wanted to know whether English had “abused” the hiring process by securing the chief of staff job in January.The criticism has outraged English’s former colleagues. “As somebody who saw her work and values her highly, I’m just really offended at the attempt to portray her as some kind of venal, spotlight-grabbing carpetbagger,” says Holly Petraeus, a former assistant director at the CFPB who retired this year. “She’s not that at all.”“The things they’re saying are so ridiculous. They just say the absolute opposite of what is true,” says Elizabeth Vale, who served as director of external affairs for the CFPB. “She could have gone and made a lot of money somewhere. She is a true, dedicated public servant who wants to make a real difference in this world ... if you asked me to put the people I admire most as public servants on that list, she would be in the top five.” Vale, who also worked with former senior adviser Valerie Jarrett in the Obama White House, now teaches at the University of Pennsylvania.That is the ultimate tragedy of the CFPB. Eventually, English will lose, one way or another. Trump or Vice President Mike Pence or someone else will get around to naming a full-time director and for a few months or maybe even a couple of years, devoted public servants will try to hang on. But capable people like English will only stick around for so long in a place where the top brass is determined to prevent them from actually accomplishing anything. They’ll accept other job offers, finding a different quiet, thankless way to contribute to society. The CFPB will decay into just another dysfunctional Washington paper-mill and banks will become steadily more shameless in their reliance on predatory practices. Not because it is inevitable, but because a handful of people in power will decide it should be so."

An estimated 150 protesters, led by nonprofit UndocuBlack Network and Asian-American coalition AAPI Immigrant Rights Organizing Table, rallied to ask Congress to pass a clean Dream Act, which would provide a pathway to citizenship for young undocumented immigrants with no strings attached, along with a permanent solution for temporary protected status (TPS) holders. “I stand in solidarity with Dreamers. I stand in solidarity with folks with TPS,” Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.) said at the rally. “We are making it known that this is a rainbow movement.”“We will not let anyone divide us, whether it’s crazy 45” ― referring to President Donald Trump ― “or our Republican colleagues,” she added. Reps. Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), Judy Chu (D-Calif.) and Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) also spoke. They all stressed the importance of finding a solution for young undocumented immigrants following the termination of Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. The futures of some 800,000 so-called Dreamers hang in the balance; they could face deportation if a DACA replacement isn’t passed before March 2018. The lawmakers also called for an end to the terminations of TPS programs until a legislative solution is found. TPS designation is typically given to countries that have conditions preventing its nationals from returning. Among the 10 countries with TPS, most of them have majority-black populations. But the Trump administration had terminated the program for several countries including Haiti. “The cruelty of the situation is very anxiety-provoking for me,” Chu told HuffPost. “To think that young people would be subjected to this kind of treatment is horrific.” Activists say they also collected about 300,000 signatures on petitions in support of Dreamers and TPS holders. After the protest, which is part of a week of advocacy events, they delivered it to the offices of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). A protest with Asian-American and black activists lets people see how many communities are affected by immigration legislation, Chu said. There are about 430,000 TPS holders in the U.S., according to estimates from the Congressional Research Service. The Center for Migration Studies estimates there are about 1.7 million undocumented Asian immigrants in the U.S.Asians represent the fastest growing demographic among undocumented immigrants. And although most Dreamers hail from Latin American countries, around 16,000 undocumented Asian youth were protected under DACA.“Through coalitions, we are stronger. By joining together, we increase our power tremendously,” Chu said. “That’s why it’s important to make sure every community is recognized, that they are seen for who they are and the whole span of Dreamers is acknowledged.”Activists said they hoped their rally would help destroy the stereotype that the black and Asian-Americans communities are at odds. “Black and [Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders] immigrants are joining hands on this historic day of action to reject the lie that our people are disposable and that we are each other’s enemies,” Jonathan Jayes-Green, co-creator and national coordinator for the UndocuBlack Network, said during the rally.“We are centering and uplifting our own voices, holding elected officials accountable and demanding a clean Dream Act and a permanent solution for TPS holders together,” he said. “The time is now, and Congress needs to act on both before the end of the year.”Chu said she thought the Dream Act would pass if brought to a vote, as the bill has so far received bipartisan support. She said she believed Ryan may not have brought the bill to the floor because of pressure from hard-right members of the Freedom Caucus, who strongly oppose it. There’s increased urgency to make moves before the year ends, Chu said, addressing the House speaker: “Give us a chance for a fair vote.”"

Stein, a highly esteemed figure in the literary world, submitted his resignation to the magazine’s board on Wednesday afternoon. He provided a copy to the Times without comment. In the letter, Stein apologized for his behavior and said he had “only begun to understand this past month” how his actions had degraded women. “At times in the past, I blurred the personal and the professional in ways that were, I now recognize, disrespectful of my colleagues and our contributors, and that made them feel uncomfortable or demeaned,” he wrote. “I am very sorry for any hurt I caused them.”The magazine’s board released a statement speaking out against workplace harassment but declined to comment on Stein specifically. “The Paris Review has no tolerance for sexual harassment,” the statement read. “We are committed to whatever is necessary to insure that The Paris Review is free from harassment and discrimination of any kind.” The board will release a more comprehensive statement tomorrow after its meeting, board president Terry McDonell said. According to the Times, Stein previously admitted to the board that he had dated and otherwise expressed interest in interns and writers for the magazine and that he had engaged in consensual sexual behavior in the office after hours before he was married in 2015.The investigation into his behavior was launched in October after Stein notified the board that his name appeared on a secretive, crowdsourced list of men accused of sexual misconduct, the Times reported. During the investigation, at least two female writers came forward with complaints about the editor’s behavior toward them. Stein is the latest in a series of high-profile media figures to either step down or be fired from their roles, including NBC’s Matt Lauer, PBS’s Charlie Rose, MSNBC’s Mark Halperin, NPR’s Michael Oreskes and The Atlantic’s Leon Wieseltier."
8,POLITICS,Republicans Are Trying To Figure Out How Not To Shut Down Government At Christmas,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-government-shutdown_us_5a284175e4b02d3bfc37be61,"Republicans and Democrats are getting closer on spending deals, but conservatives still want a say.",2017-12-06,"Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) leave a meeting on Dec. 6, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a284245150000d59f85be05.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― House Freedom Caucus leaders are easing off their demands that any bill to keep the government funded past this week go until after Christmas ― lest members take a bad deal just so they can go home and spend the holidays with their families ― but they now have a new hard line: spending.Meeting conservatives’ fiscal demands isn’t exactly looking likely at the moment, with Democrats and Republicans not far off in recent negotiations. But any theoretical agreement would be fragile ― particularly with Donald Trump as president ― and GOP and Democratic leaders are walking softly.Republican leaders especially have a tricky path to navigate, with House conservatives potentially throwing obstacles in the way of Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) on spending bills that many House Freedom Caucus members have no real intention of voting for.Still, Republicans are making progress. Delicately.After House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and former chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) met with Ryan and McCarthy on Wednesday, the conservative ringleaders suggested they wouldn’t hold up a so-called Continuing Resolution, or CR, if it only went until Dec. 22. Earlier this week, the Freedom Caucus withheld votes on a procedural motion for going to conference on the tax bill until GOP leaders agreed to discuss a later date, like Dec. 30, for the expiration of the CR.That battle appears to be over, as lawmakers now look apt to approve a mostly clean CR until Dec. 22 so Democrats and Republicans can come to a larger agreement on spending numbers, at which point Congress would have to pass yet another CR to prevent a Christmas shutdown and give appropriators time to write a bill funding the government for the rest of the fiscal year.While Meadows wasn’t quite ready to say that the deadline of the CR was decided, he appeared open to the original Dec. 22 date. “I don’t know that the December 30th deadline is as much the issue now as it is about breaking this defense and nondefense” dollar-for-dollar increases, he said.Meadows also suggested that the Freedom Caucus had effectively pushed leaders to speed up a final conference report on the tax bill so that the CR and the tax legislation wouldn’t be coupled together. Conservatives are concerned some moderate Republicans will be bought off in the tax bill with CR side-deals, so they hope to vote on the tax conference report as early as next week.That may present a challenge for some senators who wanted goodies in the CR, but all of this shutdown drama could have been prevented if Congress had just passed regular appropriations bills ― or if lawmakers hadn’t set spending caps that they refuse to live by.Congress passed a law in 2011 that set spending levels for defense and nondefense for the next 10 years. But lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are unwilling to abide by those caps. In fact, they’ve technically never lived by the limits they set in 2011. Instead, Congress typically agrees to new spending levels, with Republicans and Democrats taking dollar-for-dollar increases for defense and nondefense (though that 1:1 parity has been broken in recent years). GOP and Democratic leaders are currently going back and forth over the spending levels for this year and the next. Democrats turned down the initial Republican offer to fund defense at $54 billion above the sequester-mandated levels for each year, and fund nondefense at $34 billion above the sequester levels for each year. (In this scenario, defense would get $603 billion in fiscal year 2018 and $613 billion in fiscal year 2019, while the nondefense budget would be $547 billion and $566, respectively, for those years.)Republicans also figure to add a healthy amount of defense money in a fund supposedly used for war operations, though how much remains undetermined.Democrats countered the initial GOP proposal with $54 billion increases for both defense and nondefense for each of the next two fiscal years, but that offer was quickly rejected by Republicans.GOP sources indicate that Republicans next plan to offer $63 billion increases for the next two years for defense, and $52 billion increases for the next two years for nondefense. Democratic sources said they have not yet seen that offer, and Republican aides warn that the proposal is still subject to change.If all these numbers make your head spin, you’re not alone. Most lawmakers care little about the line-by-line details of the spending agreement ― they just want to make sure their biggest priorities are funded. It’s the Freedom Caucus ― a group of about three dozen far-right House Republicans who stand little chance of voting for the final legislative products ― who are taking the firm positions on restricting spending.Meadows and Jordan said Wednesday that conservatives were aiming to “hold the line” on the defense number while not dramatically increasing the nondefense numbers. The House this year passed its own spending agreement, with $621.5 billion for defense and $511 for nondefense. But those were Republican-only, make-believe numbers. Senate Democrats have a say over how much Republicans spend on defense and nondefense, and because GOP war hawks insist the military can’t live by the $549 billion defense cap for fiscal year 2018, Democrats have leverage on the overall agreement. (If lawmakers can’t reach a new deal by Jan. 21, the Pentagon is directed to live by that $549 billion number and, even if Congress reaches a deal soon after, it would affect acquisition and other military planning.)Those realities have scared Republicans into believing they can’t afford a shutdown, and they’ve given Democrats the ability to demand a number of deals that GOP lawmakers have thus far been unwilling to approve separately. The prospect of bad spending deals, as well as deals on other Democratic priorities, makes it unlikely that conservatives will support these eventual bills, which just drives Republican leaders to need more Democratic votes, which in turn gives Democrats even more leverage.But it’s conservatives who are looking for the leverage, even if they don’t plan to vote for the eventual deals. That quest for leverage drove the Freedom Caucus to withhold support on the tax conference legislation earlier this week, and it’s what’s driving conservatives to posture now that they could support a future CR if GOP leaders cut a good deal (even though there’s little chance that would happen).When HuffPost asked Jordan why Senate Democrats would go along with the GOP plan of passing a full-year defense bill coupled with a CR for nondefense programs later this month, he suggested Republicans could add some of those sweeteners Democrats want, like funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program and disaster relief. But when we asked if he’d support that bill if it included a deal for Cost Sharing Reductions for Obamacare, which is expected, Jordan gave us a look like we were crazy."
9,ENTERTAINMENT,Jordan Klepper Channels Jon Stewart In His Own Search For Sanity,Todd Van Luling,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jordan-klepper-the-opposition-jon-stewart_us_5a202d6de4b037b8ea206cd4,"The host of Comedy Central's ""The Opposition"" is clearly mad. He should get madder.",2017-12-06,"Jon Stewart and Jordan Klepper on ""The Opposition""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a20308e190000e500033b06.jpeg?ops=crop_136_31_1137_667%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"When Jordan Klepper made his first appearance as a correspondent on Jon Stewart’s “The Daily Show” in 2014, he spent the moments before taping “trying not to vomit.”Klepper told HuffPost he recalled Stewart coming over to him and saying “something to the effect of, ‘Don’t fuck this up.’”He didn’t vomit. But after completing his segment, Klepper wanted to live in the moment a bit longer.Full of energy, he asked whether he could do something unconventional by going into the audience to watch the rest of the taping. A member of “The Daily Show” staff replied, “Uhhh, yeah, I guess,” before ushering him to a seat where he could live in the initial high for a few more minutes.To the comedian’s relief, Stewart complimented him following the performance. After trying to break into the industry for a dozen or so years, Klepper had finally earned his big break and solidified his role as a correspondent on the hit Comedy Central show.“But I still retained the essence, and each time I went out there, I knew it was my job to not fuck it up,” Klepper told HuffPost.Klepper now has his own show, “The Opposition,” which debuted on Comedy Central in September and airs weeknights at 11:30 p.m. EST. The series follows Trevor Noah’s “The Daily Show” in the time slot previously occupied by Larry Wilmore’s “The Nightly Show” and Stephen Colbert’s “The Colbert Report.”“The Opposition” is a clear extension of ideas from Colbert’s hit. Like the comedian before him, Klepper plays a parody of an ultra-conservative talking head who chimes in on current events, lampooning right-wing viewpoints by fully embracing them.With Donald Trump committing various morally bankrupt and increasingly ... screwball actions as president, television is in need of a grotesque brand of satire that will capture the right level of absurdity for viewers. In theory, “The Opposition” should fit the bill: Klepper’s character aims to mirror the hatred and incredulity playing out in politics as well as in the newly ascendant conservative media of Breitbart and Infowars.In creating the character, Klepper and his team decided “that trolling culture is something we could embody and embrace.”But “The Opposition” is still figuring out how to fulfill that goal in a way that resonates with viewers. Its ratings started decently, but have dipped as the show nears its fourth month on-air.Significantly fewer viewers have tuned into “The Opposition” than Wilmore’s 2015 show, which was canceled after two years. Clips haven’t garnered as much traction on YouTube compared with other Comedy Central shows. Critics have remained mostly mixed on the program. Still, this worthy experiment shouldn’t be counted out just yet.Comedy is practically in Klepper’s blood. He become interested in it at an early age, spending time with his mother’s cousin, comedian Tim Allen.“Growing up I would see him [Allen] once a year at Thanksgiving and it was fun to watch him start to find fame and get on television,” Klepper said, noting how his sister would tape every episode of Allen’s show, “Home Improvement.” “It was really exciting to see someone that you knew, someone who’s a family member, find success.”Klepper eventually joined an improv group as a student at Kalamazoo College in Michigan and became a “comedy junkie.” After graduating in 2001, he started teaching improv classes and would continue to do so for years, imparting the wisdom of “yes, and” ― an improvisational rule where participants go along with whatever idea is suggested and expand on that line of thinking.Being close to Allen’s success while growing up helped boost Klepper’s confidence about his chances to essentially say “yes, and” for years as he tried to find his own role in the industry, spending time at Chicago’s The Second City and the Upright Citizens Brigade in New York. Klepper hosted numerous live comedy events in the style of late-night talk shows before ultimately finding television success with “The Daily Show.”He still worried if he’d ever get his break. “I spent a good 10, 15 years questioning that, but I was lucky enough to find some real fortunate breaks along the way,” Klepper said.“The Opposition,” this latest break, has been full of unexpected decisions to be made. Small choices, like picking the behind-the-scenes songs that play over the studio speakers have made Klepper giddy.“I probably spent an entire day going through the playlist that I wanted to play during when the audience comes in,” Klepper said. He chose LCD Soundsystem’s “Us Vs Them” as a go-to song that plays right before the taping starts.“You can read into that title or not,” Klepper said, laughing.He’s run into challenges while getting this show off the ground outside of creative decisions. For those, he’s turned to Stewart for help a few times.“I was like, ‘Oh shit, Jon, can I have a really boring hiring conversation?’” Klepper said. The two had breakfast when Klepper was first outlining his show and Stewart has continued to be a mentor since.“The idea of a satirical news show that can appear every day, that [was] something only Jon Stewart was doing a handful of years ago, and now it’s become almost a genre onto itself,” Klepper said. “For me, he was such a great and inspiring boss and had a workplace that I wanted to be at every day. I was like, ‘I want to create that, can you help me with that?’”“The Opposition” is similar to “The Daily Show” as they both attempt to attack “bullshit,” a word Klepper and Stewart have used repeatedly to describe the theoretical enemy of their respective shows. Stewart closed out his run on “The Daily Show” with a speech about how “bullshit is everywhere,” and advocated that viewers should try to call it out: If they “smell something,” he said, they should “say something.”In a promotional event for “The Opposition” that took place in September, Klepper explained his show’s goal.“You see where you can take that nugget of shit ― this is getting to be a pretty gross metaphor right now,” he said, before continuing: “We take that nugget that we actually see out there and I think we get to show [it], we get to heighten.”This attack on bullshit is essentially done by amplifying the absurdity of views the shows find abhorrent for comedic effect.“Let’s take what is happening today, and let’s find a way to comment on it and embody it and heighten whatever is ridiculous,” Klepper said.Klepper said “The Opposition” specifically parodies a rising ethos that “it’s more important to take a strong stance against something, even if you don’t know what you’re standing for ― at least you’re getting a reaction.”As such, the show is against being against things, by embodying the spirit of being against things. It’s so meta that it’s hard to even talk about. This premise for “The Opposition” comedically makes sense when you watch the show, but is hard to describe in a pithy way, say, to a friend.It also doesn’t help that Klepper has to compete for attention with so many satirical late-night shows coming from former “Daily Show” correspondents. Noah, Colbert, Samantha Bee and John Oliver all have successful shows at the moment bolstered by the hosts’ political takes.Still, Klepper has an advantage with his choice to play a character instead of acting as himself. The seemingly circus-like nature of political discourse today needs an equally outsized persona to meet it.Perhaps this is a moment for a Howard Beale type inspired by the anchorman from the 1976 satirical movie “Network.”After losing his mind, Beale (played by Peter Finch) starts calling out the bullshit of society from his anchor desk, memorably telling his millions of viewers to open their windows, stick their heads out and scream, “I’m as mad as hell, and I’m not going to take this anymore!”It’s a persona Klepper flirts with, but has yet to quite achieve on “The Opposition.”“I’m not the news. I’m somebody who’s going to look at the news, have an opinion on that news and convey it with that opinion,” Klepper said. “I think for a lot of people, that’s refreshing, because you can see the commentary and don’t have to be sold the bullshit that’s not editorialized.”Klepper is clearly mad. He should get madder.If “Daily Show” levels of success seem like a gargantuan obstacle for the still-new “Opposition,” Klepper’s experience on the former should only help. He’s been able to overcome hurdles before.“I remember that first day on ‘The Daily Show’ so vividly,” he said. “I showed up that day and basically went right into a meeting about Crimea, there was movement in Crimea.”“I found myself in a meeting with Jon Stewart where he was discussing the day’s news stories and at that point I was like, ‘I don’t even know where this is on a map, let alone what I can add to this conversation,‘” Klepper added, “and then quickly found myself writing a chat about it, working with the writers about it. [That’s] kind of how ‘The Daily Show’ works. You just are thrown in and you just start moving. And you start figuring it out and you’re surrounded by a lot of supportive, smart people.”“The Opposition” is a well-designed machine with a great conductor who hasn’t captured wide appeal just yet. It’s still early, though. Its host is an immensely talented satirical anchor, and the show’s premise has heaps of potential to succeed in this era. It’s not quite time to celebrate yet. For now, the host will just have to keep working hard, just as he did with his last big break.“I’ve gone to some ‘SNL’ parties where you do the show and then everybody goes out and has giant parties with Paul McCartney at huge New York clubs,” he said. “I’m leaving ‘The Daily Show’ and am like, ‘So, wh-wh-what do we do? Are we going out for drinks?’ And they started turning off the lights. They were like, ’No, you go home and you read the news and you do this again tomorrow.’” "
10,POLITICS,President Trump's Environmental Pick Doesn't Understand The Job,"Nancy Sutley, ContributorFormer Chair of the White House Council on Environmental Quality",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/president-trumps-pick-to-fill-my-old-job-doesnt-understand-the-job_us_5a283d5de4b0c2117627ecb2,"For 40 years, the White House Council on Environmental Quality has carried out its mission under presidents of both parties.",2017-12-06,"Kathleen Hartnett White arrives at Trump Tower, November 28, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a28420e140000fe79b6bcf3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For more than five years, I had the honor of serving President Barack Obama as his top environmental advisor and Chair of the White House Council on Environmental Quality. The law that created the Council on Environmental Quality, signed by President Richard Nixon, gives CEQ the responsibility to advise the president on policies that improve the environment. For more than 40 years, under Republican and Democratic presidents, CEQ has carried that mission out, as Congress directed, for the benefit of current and future generations. CEQ’s charge is clear and unambiguous: help make our environment cleaner and safer.While it’s sadly no surprise that President Trump does not value similar priorities among his advisors, it has become clear that the primary goal of the Trump administration’s environmental nominees is to dismantle our clean air and water standards. Trump’s nominees for our nation’s top public health and environmental posts have fought against worker protections, ignored the impacts of toxic chemicals on children, and lobbied for the polluting industries they will now be overseeing.In this context, it is critical to look at the record of Kathleen Hartnett White, Trump’s nomination for the position I once held at the White House. In her years at the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) and currently at the Koch-backed Texas Public Policy Foundation, Hartnett White has demonstrated both a lack of understanding of policy and science, as well as questionable judgment in a series of decisions that should raise serious concerns about her intentions.First, as NowThis’s viral video clearly shows, she denies the science behind climate change and does not seem to possess even a basic understanding of environmental issues.Hartnett White has written that global warming “is a creed, a faith, a dogma that has little to do with science,” and stated that “we’re not a democracy if science dictates what our rules are.” But science must inform environmental policy, otherwise it’s just political whim. She has touted the supposed benefits of pollution, calling carbon dioxide “the gas of life” and “lacking any characteristics of a pollutant” and arguing that an “abolition of fossil fuels...would be...morally objectionable.” And in a paper entitled Fossil Fuels: The Moral Case, Hartnett White argued that “the increased atmospheric concentration of man-made CO2 has enhanced plant growth and thus the world’s food supply.” These statements seem to fly in the face of facts and common sense, begging the alarming question of how Hartnett White would advise the federal government on these serious policy matters.Finally, Hartnett White made a series of decisions while leading TCEQ that appear to put industry interests above public safety. In what the government watchdog group Public Citizen called a “massive cover-up,” White reportedly led an effort to alter statistical data in order to hide the amount of radiation in the drinking water of some Texas communities. This means that she knowingly exposed communities to cancer causing agents. Additionally, a 2003 state auditor report found that TCEQ under Hartnett White’s leadership failed to hold polluters accountable for violating state environmental law. Hartnett White also voted to move forward with the construction of a coal plant outside of Dallas, arguing that the plant’s operators had no responsibility to make sure its pollution controls worked, despite the objections of the cities of Dallas, Austin, and dozens of other local Texas governments. The Dallas Morning News wrote in an editorial after she left TCEQ that Hartnett White is “an apologist for polluter.,” and just a few weeks ago, urged the Senate to reject her nomination to the White House post.Our country needs dedicated public servants who put the health of American people first. CEQ must have a leader who will commit themselves to the environmental goals that Congress agreed upon and laid out. Without that commitment, Kathleen Hartnett White is the wrong choice for the job and the Senate should not confirm her to lead the White House Council on Environmental Quality.Nancy Sutley is the former Chair of the White House Council on Environmental Quality. These are her personal views."

The free art show is held at the Miami hotel Alex and his husband operate, Hôtel Gaythering, from December 6 - 10. Check it out if you’re in the area.Phillip M Miner (PM): For people who’ve never heard about it, tell me about Art Gaysel? Alex Guerra (AG): I started Art Gaysel because the artist struggle is reeeeaaaaalllll!!!! As a queer artist myself, I know what it’s like to knock on gallery doors, trying to get your work to be seen in the hopes of taking your work to the next level. In the emerging art world, the highest level (before a Museum of course) rests in the hands of those galleries exhibiting work at art fairs like Scope, Pulse and Art Miami. Dream Big Girl! Everyone doesn’t get that chance but they can at Art Gaysel. These artists get a fast pass into one of the most prestigious weeks in art in this country, Art Basel/Art Week Miami.PM: Wordplay is my favorite.AG: As a local every year I hear other locals and visitors refer to the week as “Art Basil.” It’s funny to hear and since I can’t pass-up a good play on words, I decided that it would be great to name our event “Art Gaysel”.PM: Speaking of wordplay? Gaythering? AG: When my partner Stephan and I opened “the Gaythering” Hôtel Gaythering in 2014, the mission was in the name. This is going to be a Gathering Place for the Gay Community and its allies. The mission of our space is to create a safe space that lifts and encourages not just the Miami Gay Community but also our extended gay community globally.PM: I saw you highlight Spanish artists this year. Can you say more about that? AG: I am a big fan of the work by “El Dibujo” and through getting to know him via Instagram, I was introduced to Bran Solo & Fran Munyoz. Instagram as a platform was and is crucial in the development of Art Gaysel. The platform has helped me find and reach out to many artists which I have become friends with and collectors of. As luck would have it, these boys are all friends so I decided I wanted to take the event to another level and afford these guys the opportunity not only to visit this country (which they had not), but to expand our reach into Europe. Incorporating these boys and Pascual Rodriguez opens the door to the future queer artists living in other countries hopefully exhibiting at Art Gaysel 4 and beyond. PM: Can you talk more about curating the show? AG: Curating is one of the most rewarding and exiting aspects of Art Gaysel. The process results in an ultimate collage of artists and Art Gaysel is “the piece”. The handpicked pieces to create one amazing work of art. My goal in curating the main show is to entice the patrons/guests of the event to want to see more. It’s simply a taste. I want work that excites the viewer, makes them want to know more and makes them want the ultimate engagement with it, taking it home. A few artists were invited to be a part of the show with the requirements of exhibiting artwork in the main show located in our Library, and bringing enough work to exhibit out of their rooms. Each artist is also required to open their doors during the event hours and engage with guests touring the show. The rooms become like a studio walk through. PM: Exhibiting out of their hotel rooms? AG: In a sense it’s an artist in residency on the most important week of Art in Miami. We as business owners get to showcase our “works of art” our guest rooms and also house these artists that have been invited to stay at no cost to them. We decided that this aspect of the show is important to us as we see it as a form of giving back.As a side note, we have incorporated two of our revamped guests rooms into the mix so our patrons and visitors can experience our new look, which we are referring to as “Blush & Bashful” a new direction from our existing “Handsome Industrial” design.PM: Blush and Bashful? Your colors are pink and pink. Note, I lied earlier, my favorite thing isn’t wordplay. It’s quoting Steel Magnolias. But, that’s a smart business move. Can you talk more about the business side of running a queer business / selling queer art?AG: As a business owner I can tell you that Instagram is where it’s at. Instagram has created an environment that was lost with Facebook. A safe space to share your day to day without the negativity that engulfs other social media platforms.Some of the most fascinating and engaging Instragrammers are those that have realized the potential to promote themselves and their art. They have learned to curate their posts in a way to showcase work and the process.PM: Back to curation, I saw people of color have a special exhibition this year? AG: There is definitely intent to highlight work by Queer Artists of Color. Simply incorporating their work would have not been enough in my eyes. The current social climate is appalling and that’s not just referring to our country’s social climate. I’m also referring to the social climate within the gay community. When Philly decided to add a Black and a Brown stripe to the gay flag I thought it was genius. Here is art in action. This moment was crucial in stating that people of color feel forgotten and ousted from the party. “No Blacks, No Asians, No Fems” is sadly a social norm in our community.Had I simply sprinkled the work of Queer Artists of Color the message would end at those artists with accepting them personally. By featuring these artists and giving them a Q&A platform at the event, we are letting the Community of Color know that we see them. We see you, your talent, your struggle and we acknowledge your seat at the table.Art Gaysel is an extension of our Gaythering mission and my passion for art. We created the event to encourage and lift queer artists on a week that is usually only dreamed about by many artists."

Instagram as a platform was and is crucial in the development of Art Gaysel. The platform has helped me find and reach out to many artists which I have become friends with and collectors of. As luck would have it, these boys are all friends so I decided I wanted to take the event to another level and afford these guys the opportunity not only to visit this country (which they had not), but to expand our reach into Europe. Incorporating these boys and Pascual Rodriguez opens the door to the future queer artists living in other countries hopefully exhibiting at Art Gaysel 4 and beyond. PM: Can you talk more about curating the show? AG: Curating is one of the most rewarding and exiting aspects of Art Gaysel. The process results in an ultimate collage of artists and Art Gaysel is “the piece”. The handpicked pieces to create one amazing work of art. My goal in curating the main show is to entice the patrons/guests of the event to want to see more. It’s simply a taste. I want work that excites the viewer, makes them want to know more and makes them want the ultimate engagement with it, taking it home. A few artists were invited to be a part of the show with the requirements of exhibiting artwork in the main show located in our Library, and bringing enough work to exhibit out of their rooms. Each artist is also required to open their doors during the event hours and engage with guests touring the show. The rooms become like a studio walk through. PM: Exhibiting out of their hotel rooms? AG: In a sense it’s an artist in residency on the most important week of Art in Miami. We as business owners get to showcase our “works of art” our guest rooms and also house these artists that have been invited to stay at no cost to them. We decided that this aspect of the show is important to us as we see it as a form of giving back.As a side note, we have incorporated two of our revamped guests rooms into the mix so our patrons and visitors can experience our new look, which we are referring to as “Blush & Bashful” a new direction from our existing “Handsome Industrial” design.PM: Blush and Bashful? Your colors are pink and pink. Note, I lied earlier, my favorite thing isn’t wordplay. It’s quoting Steel Magnolias. But, that’s a smart business move. Can you talk more about the business side of running a queer business / selling queer art?AG: As a business owner I can tell you that Instagram is where it’s at. Instagram has created an environment that was lost with Facebook. A safe space to share your day to day without the negativity that engulfs other social media platforms.Some of the most fascinating and engaging Instragrammers are those that have realized the potential to promote themselves and their art. They have learned to curate their posts in a way to showcase work and the process.PM: Back to curation, I saw people of color have a special exhibition this year? AG: There is definitely intent to highlight work by Queer Artists of Color. Simply incorporating their work would have not been enough in my eyes. The current social climate is appalling and that’s not just referring to our country’s social climate. I’m also referring to the social climate within the gay community. When Philly decided to add a Black and a Brown stripe to the gay flag I thought it was genius. Here is art in action. This moment was crucial in stating that people of color feel forgotten and ousted from the party. “No Blacks, No Asians, No Fems” is sadly a social norm in our community.Had I simply sprinkled the work of Queer Artists of Color the message would end at those artists with accepting them personally. By featuring these artists and giving them a Q&A platform at the event, we are letting the Community of Color know that we see them. We see you, your talent, your struggle and we acknowledge your seat at the table.Art Gaysel is an extension of our Gaythering mission and my passion for art. We created the event to encourage and lift queer artists on a week that is usually only dreamed about by many artists."

Now, Glazer and Jacobson say they are “figuring out” what to do with Becky, who is credited as a producer on “Broad City.” “It’s definitely something that we’re figuring out right now,” Jacobson told EW Radio. “He’s not our manager. And he’s been a producer on the show through Amy [Poehler] from the beginning. And it’s like this upsetting thing to find out his involvement in the whole thing, so it’s definitely something that we’re constantly talking about right now.”Glazer added that the two take responsibility for any success they may have had because of Becky. “We take accountability for using this white dude power to get our show on TV,” Glazer said. “We’re accountable for that. We’re not accountable for Louis’ actions, for Becky’s actions, but we’re accountable for using his power to get our show on TV.”In a statement to TMZ on Nov. 13, Becky admitted to and apologized for attempting to cover up Louis C.K.’s behavior.“I profoundly regret and am deeply sorry for not listening to and not understanding what happened to Dana and Julia,” Becky wrote. “If I had, I would have taken this event as seriously as it deserved to be, and I would have confronted Louis, which would have been the right thing to do.”"

16,POLITICS,Feds Say Photographer Facing Felonies After Trump Inauguration Arrest Is 'Fake' News,Ryan J. Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alexei-wood-journalist-inauguration-trial_us_5a27549de4b044d16725bdb8,Alexei Wood and five others are on trial in D.C. in a case that raises big First Amendment issues.,2017-12-06,Alexei Wood stands outside D.C. Superior Court on Wednesday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0cb9e11b0000e72a37743e.jpeg?cache=5dwszkNout&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― A Justice Department prosecutor alleged this week that a photographer currently facing several felony charges in connection with his arrest during President Donald Trump’s inauguration had a fake press pass under a false name.Alexei Wood, a 37-year-old from San Antonio, is currently on trial alongside five others in connection with his arrest on Jan. 20. Police made more than 200 arrests that day after people smashed windows in downtown D.C. as a large group mostly clad in black roamed the streets. Prosecutors have conceded there’s no evidence that any of the six individuals currently on trial actually caused any destruction, but say they are guilty of several felony charges for enabling what prosecutors have called a riot.There are 181 others facing felony trials over the next year, and this first trial could determine how the office of the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, currently headed by a Trump appointee, handles the remainder of the cases.Wearing purple medical gloves, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jennifer Kerkhoff on Wednesday dangled a lanyard and a press pass ― labeled as government exhibit 48 ― before Metropolitan Police Department Detective Gregg Pemberton, who has spent months poring over the extensive video footage that captured the unrest in downtown D.C. on Jan. 20. Pemberton said there was no evidence that Wood’s identification was a “legitimate press badge.”Earlier in the week, Kerkhoff suggested that Wood had “fake credentials” under the false name of “John Osburn.” Pemberton said Wednesday that “John Osburn” was not an alias for Woods, but that the press pass did feature Woods’ image. Wood and his attorney Brett Cohen declined on Wednesday to explain Wood’s apparent use of another name, but Wood is expected to take the stand when the trial resumes next week.There are a variety of types of press passes, so it is difficult to label any single pass as “fake.” While numerous government entities issue press passes that require some sort of screening process, news organizations also issue their own press passes. The pass Wood was apparently carrying was purportedly issued by “Indy Media” or “Glass Bead Media Collective,” according to court testimony.Wood livestreamed nearly the entire protest on Facebook, and the prosecution played the whole video for jurors on Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday morning. The video does not show Wood engaged in any violence or destruction, but does show him making comments that could be seen as supportive of property destruction. The video shows him getting into verbal confrontations with a man who apparently grabbed a demonstrator as well as a “Biker for Trump” who tried to assist police officers in apprehending one individual.“My professionalism is certainly up to be criticized, and I’m open to it and I’m welcoming of it,” Wood told HuffPost in a prior interview. “But I absolutely stand by that I did nothing illegal and I did nothing wrong.”Kerkhoff had told jurors in her opening statement that they’d see Wood “cheering when the destruction happens.” Wood’s attorney argued that his comments on the video, while they may be “disagreeable,” were directed not at the people around him, but rather at the audience watching his livestream.Wood, who has worked as a wedding and commercial photographer, says he came to D.C. in hopes of building his photojournalism resume. Officers on the scene released many of the journalists they detained in the mass arrest. But the decisions about who was allowed out of the police kettle seemed arbitrary. The government has presented as evidence a video featuring Lauren Southern, the alt-right YouTube commentator who was released without being arrested. Southern’s team apparently had to mislead police to get out of the kettle.“I had to pretend I was pregnant,” Southern said in another video. “My security had to yell ‘she’s pregnant’ to get me out of there.” In the full video that was introduced at trial, a male voice says he’s “got a pregnant lady coming out,” as they emerge from the kettle before Southern says, “We’re media, we’re media.”Of the nine journalists who were arrested that day, only two are still facing charges. Alex Rubinstein, who works with Russian-funded RT, wrote a lengthy post this week detailing his experience and said a judge recently exonerated him of the charges the government previously dropped.So far, D.C. Superior Court Judge Lynn Leibovitz has given prosecutors wide latitude, regularly overruling objections from the six defendants’ legal team, which outnumbers the jury. Outside the presence of the jury on Tuesday, Leibovitz referred to one of Wood’s remarks as “commentary in furtherance of the conspiracy.”On trial alongside Wood are Jennifer Armento, Oliver Harris, Britt Lawson, Michelle Macchio and Christina Simmons. The trial will resume Monday, when the government is expected to wrap up its case.If convicted of all charges, Wood and his co-defendants would face a maximum of more than 60 years in prison, though such a lengthy sentence is highly unlikely. The only defendant who has pleaded guilty to a felony so far, Dane Powell, was sentenced to four months in prison for felony rioting and felony assault on a police officer. He admitted to actually smashing store windows and throwing rocks at officers.CORRECTION: This story has been updated to clarify that Dane Powell was so far the only defendant to plead guilty to a felony, not the only defendant to plead guilty.Ryan Reilly is HuffPost’s senior justice reporter, covering criminal justice, federal law enforcement and legal affairs.

The kiosks made news when people began using the public web browsers to watch pornography, and CityBridge the private consortium administering LinkNYC limited the browsers, and made other changes to limit how LinkNYC would store personal browser history, time spent on a particular website, and lacked clarity about how LinkNYC would handle government demands for user data, among others issues.But now there’s a new battle brewing. It seems that each of the LinkNYC kiosks has front-facing cameras. Starting on a number of blocks on the Upper West Side, an unknown number of digital protesters has begun to adhere yellow post-it-notes onto the Kiosks, effectively blocking the camera’s view. Then, late a night, a van marked LinkNYC drives up Broadway were a worker with a long stick with a scraper clears the Post-its. But within days, the Post-Its return. The skirmish over the cameras may have been going on for some time, and it’s unclear how widespread the action is, or if there is an organization behind disabling the cameras.The Electronic Frontier Foundation is reporting that LinkNYC “Improves Privacy Policy, Yet Problems Remain” in a post on their website. They say, in part: “In the wake of its 2017 policy changes, LinkNYC still collects what it describes as “Technical Information,” including information such as IP addresses, anonymized MAC addresses, device type, device identifiers, and more, for up to 60 days. Additionally, the LinkNYC kiosks have cameras that store footage for up to 7 days.”And the NYCLU has been engaging Mayor DeBlasio on the matter as well - saying in a letter: “the NYCLU remains concerned about the vast amount of private information retained by the LinkNYC system and the lack of robust language in the privacy policy protecting users against unwarranted government surveillance.”And goes on to say: “The NYCLU seeks clarification on CityBridge’s policy regarding sharing of data collected by the environmental sensors and cameras on the Links. The policy states that “[CityBridge] will not give any data collected by environmental sensors or cameras to anyone other than the City or governmental law enforcement,” with a few exceptions. One of those exceptions is with “advanced, written permission from the City.” We would like to know whether the environmental sensors and cameras will be routinely feeding into any City or NYPD systems, including the Domain Awareness System; if so, that should be made explicit in the privacy policy.”We’ve reached out to LinkNYC and EFF to get any additional details about the LinkNYC cameras and the ongoing blockage campaign.Updated (2) : EFF responded with this statement:“EFF is not familiar with the campaign to cover the cameras on LinkNYC kiosks with post-it notes, but it should come as no surprise” said EFF Director of Grassroots Advocacy Shahid Buttar. “As we have noted before, the LinkNYC system lacks any opportunity for public participation in the policymaking process, as well as remedies for potential violations of its privacy policy or inevitable data breaches. The activation of the kiosks’ cameras reflect both of those problems, making them a predictable target for street artists.”A spokesperson for LinkNYC responded: “All Links are visited and cleaned twice a week as part of maintaining the network. This is not a widespread issue.”And NYCLU responded to a request for comment about the cameras being obscured, said: “We appreciate that the city responded to the issues we raised about LinkNYC kiosks and improved privacy protections in their policy. Yet, so long as kiosks capture vast amounts of information about public and private life, we remain concerned for New Yorkers’ privacy.”"
18,POLITICS,Elizabeth Warren’s 3 Steps To Cut Corporate Power With Laws Already On The Books,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/elizabeth-warren-antitrust-corporate-power_us_5a282cdde4b044d16726ed55,The senator said the government has the tools to tackle monopolies. It just needs to use them.,2017-12-06,Sen. Elizabeth Warren aims to reduce corporate power over the economy and politics.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a282d6f150000d59f85bda6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) detailed a comprehensive program that the federal bureaucracy could undertake immediately to reduce corporate power over the economy and politics in a speech before an antitrust conference on Wednesday.Antitrust enforcement is the key to government efforts to tackle corporate power, according to Warren. Over the past four decades, government regulators and lawyers have embraced weaker interpretations of antitrust laws and principles, allowing massive companies to gobble up competitors and expand their reach across sectors. Warren’s approach is to reverse this lax enforcement trend and reinvigorate the antitrust laws already on the books.“To rebuild an economy that works for everyone, not just the big guys, it is critical to reduce concentrated power in our markets,” Warren said at the Washington conference hosted by the nonprofit Open Markets Institute, which favors vigorous antitrust enforcement. “The federal government has the tools to do it. Congress handed antitrust enforcers those tools over a century ago. But those tools have been sitting on the shelf for decades, gathering dust.”In many ways, Warren’s proposed program shows what a future president ― perhaps, the senator herself after 2020 ― could do to tackle corporate power quickly upon taking office. She outlined three key steps.First, she said the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission need to block any mergers that “choke off competition” and take to court any large company that is impeding competition and innovation. This requires the right leadership at DOJ’s antitrust division and the FTC. Warren specifically pointed to a decision by the FTC commissioners named by President Barack Obama to overrule a recommendation by the agency’s own lawyers to punish Google for using its monopoly position in online search to harm competitors.“We need enforcers with steel spines who will stand up to companies with the best-dressed lobbyists, the craftiest lawyers and the highest-paid economists,” Warren said. “Enforcers who will turn down papier-mâché settlement agreements and actually take cases to court.”This effort should not be focused solely on mergers between direct competitors, Warren said, but should also look hard at vertical mergers ― those between companies at different stages of an industry’s chain of production.One clear case of a problematic vertical merger is AT&T’s proposed purchase of Time Warner. AT&T is one of the nation’s three largest telecommunications firms with investments in telephony, wireless communications, high-speed internet and satellite television. Time Warner is one of the largest entertainment companies with ownership over dozens of cable stations, including HBO, and the Warner Bros. film studio.Warren praised the Trump administration for bringing a lawsuit to stop the proposed merger on anti-competitive grounds. At the same time, she said, “The president’s attacks on our free press have cast a cloud of suspicion over the decision to block the merger.” Time Warner owns CNN, a frequent target of President Donald Trump’s attacks on the media.“It’s essential that the courts and the public approach this case as they would any other ― based on the law and the facts, and not on President Trump’s repeated efforts to punish his enemies,” she added.Warren’s second step is for the federal antitrust agencies to crack down on anti-competitive behavior beyond mergers. For instance, she said the federal government should go after the use of anti-poaching agreements among companies and franchises that prevent employees from obtaining jobs that could increase their pay.The late founder of Apple, Steve Jobs, orchestrated a massive anti-poaching agreement with Google, Intel and Adobe whereby the four companies would not recruit each others’ workers. This was an illegal pact among CEOs that reduced the power of their employees. In 2015, the companies involved were forced to pay out $415 million to workers in a mass settlement.And it’s not just Silicon Valley tech giants that seek to restrict their employees’ options. Franchise companies like Jimmy John’s, Jiffy Lube, Burger King and Baskin Robbins have all been caught using non-compete agreements to prevent their low-wage workers from leaving one franchise for another in search of better pay or less abusive bosses.DOJ needs to make it clear that these non-compete clauses are illegal, Warren said, by bringing lawsuits against firms using them.Step three in Warren’s attack on corporate power is likely the most important one: requiring that every federal agency work to increase competition and reduce monopoly power where they have the power to do so.That means the Federal Communications Commission should enforce strong net neutrality rules, not undo them as Trump’s FCC plans to do. The Food and Drug Administration could reel in pharmaceutical monopolies through its control over which drugs come to market and when and at what cost. The Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation could make sure that banks are really not too big to fail. The Department of Defense, the largest end purchaser of goods in the country, could inject much greater competition into its contracting process by limiting the power of the small number of massive defense contractors.“The way I see it, the fight for stronger competition is similar to the fights over health care or tax reform or the other big issues that are at stake,” Warren said. “At their core, these fights are about what kind of country we’re building: one that works only for the wealthy and powerful, or one that works for all of us.”"

Ninety-two days, to be more specific.Each passing day increases the anxiety and intensity for me and 800,000 other young people who have been able to live their lives, go to school, work and contribute to their communities thanks to the Obama-era protection from deportation for undocumented youth.Trump ended the protected status for those of us who receive DACA and gave Congress an artificial deadline of March 5 next year to come up with a legislative solution.Now young immigrants, advocates and both Democrats and Republicans are pushing for just such a solution before the end of the year. There is a large bipartisan support for young undocumented immigrants raised in this country and who are Americans in every respect, except for paperwork.This push to find a solution reaches a zenith this week in Washington, D.C. as caravans of young undocumented immigrants and supporters plan to descend on Capitol Hill with sit-ins and rallies. The business community is among those allies, who will push out ads from political leaders and legislators in support of DACA.Coordinated rallies are taking place in major cities across the nation. Many of us see this as a crucial moment to make a stance and push for reform to protect the program and us from deportation.I want to be in Washington, D.C., but I can’t. DACA is very personal to me. I need it to go to school, obtain a driver’s license and travel. Until the federal government approves my DACA status, I’m stuck in the city where I live.Thankfully, we can all help even if we are not in D.C. We can take action by calling, tweeting and mailing our local representatives to stand with undocumented immigrants and call for a clean DREAM Act that would provide a pathway to citizenship. Most importantly, we can help spread the truth about undocumented immigrants. We are hardworking people. We are your neighbors, your fellow church parishioners, your classmates and your co-workers.We need a solution that help us remain in our communities. Otherwise, we could see mass deportations, raids and larger detention camps. If a solution isn’t passed, starting March 5, Dreamers by the thousands will be deported every week. As it is 122 people lose their DACA status every day.Every day that passes, the number of Dreamers in the country slowly dwindles. One by one, people will lose their jobs. One by one, someone will lose their sister, brother, or mother. One by one, someone’s life will be ruined.I came with my family from Malaysia when I was a young child. I hardly remember it. America has been my home for 17 years. It’s the only home I know. I’ve built a life here, in America. I’ve become family with the people here, in America. I care about the people here, in America. I’ve worked tirelessly to make a difference here, in America. A piece of paper won’t make me any more American than I already am, but it will give me a chance to contribute to my home here, in America.The moment may seem dark, but we are DREAMers. We choose to be stoic and optimistic. We trust in America. We trust that the American people will stand with us and do what they know in their hearts is the right thing to do. We have a chance to change the course of history. Let’s not let any more days pass by.Kok-Leong Seow is a communications fellow for the Center for Community Change."

Just hours before Trump announced the decision on Wednesday, Pope Francis made an impassioned plea against doing anything to stir tension in the region.“I cannot remain silent about my deep concern for the situation that has developed in recent days and, at the same time, I wish to make a heartfelt appeal to ensure that everyone is committed to respecting the status quo of the city, in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations,” the pontiff said, according to The New York Times.“Jerusalem is a unique city, sacred to Jews, Christians and Muslims, where the Holy Places for the respective religions are venerated, and it has a special vocation to peace,” he said.Francis said he was praying that “wisdom and prudence prevail” and that no announcement would add “new elements of tension in a world already shaken and scarred by many cruel conflicts.”Jerusalem’s governance has long been disputed, and both Israelis and Palestinians consider the city their capital. Israel has de facto control of the city since seizing its eastern part from Jordan in 1967, but the international community has refused to recognize that authority. The U.S. government has taken the stance that Israelis and Palestinians should determine the city’s status between themselves. Keeping the U.S. Embassy in the undisputed city of Tel Aviv has ensured that the U.S. wasn’t seen as taking a side on Jerusalem’s final status.Trump had promised during his campaign and early presidency to make the policy change but deferred the decision when the six-month deadline arrived in June. (A 1995 U.S. law called for the embassy to be relocated to Jerusalem, but every president since has signed a waiver every six months to prevent the move.)The decision will likely placate the Israeli government and conservative allies in the U.S. who have long held that Jerusalem is the rightful capital of Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the U.S. Embassy “needs to be” in Jerusalem.But many religious leaders in Jerusalem feel differently. In a letter released to Trump on Wednesday, a group of 13 Christian patriarchs and heads of churches in Jerusalem urged the president not to make any changes on the status of the city that could compromise the region’s tenuous peace.“We are certain that such steps will yield increased hatred, conflict, violence and suffering in Jerusalem and the Holy Land, moving us farther from the goal of unity and deeper toward destructive division,” the Christian leaders wrote. “We ask from you Mr. President to help us all walk towards more love and a definitive peace, which cannot be reached without Jerusalem being for all.”Already on Wednesday protests had erupted over the decision in the Palestinian cities of Gaza City and Rafah. People took to the streets chanting “Death to America,” “Death to Israel” and “Down with Trump.” Some protesters burned American and Israeli flags as well as photos of Trump. Palestinian and Islamic groups called for three days of “popular anger” against the president.The patriarchs urged Trump “to continue recognizing the present international status of Jerusalem.”They warned: “Any sudden changes would cause irreparable harm.”"

The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) stages a meeting each year, known as the Council of the Parties, or COP, to negotiate international mechanisms for addressing the causes and impacts of climate change. This year it was led by Fiji and located at the UNFCCC headquarters in Bonn, Germany. I attended the 21st such meeting, COP21, in Paris, France as a U.S. federal employee and had the opportunity to witness history as the Paris Agreement was deliberated and eventually signed. Times have changed, however. As the Trump administration’s first and only climate whistleblower (so far), I had a fat chance of getting invited to join the U.S. delegation this year, but with the kind cooperation and support of Sweden and the Stockholm Environment Institute, I was able to make it to Bonn, Germany in time for the main events at COP23.Upon arrival I collected my credentials and explored the Pavilion area where countries from around the world had set up exhibition spaces for presentations and discussions. It’s difficult to describe the strangely artificial but cosmopolitan experience of wandering among these delegation pavilions, speaking with their representatives, strolling from South Korea to Senegal, meandering from Morocco to Malaysia as if a sterilized version of the planet had just shrunk down to the size of a city park. The sense of wonder lasts about an hour or so before the demands of a busy schedule spread out across a giant venue deaden the experience somewhat.Due to speak on Arctic resilience at the Nordic Pavilion in 10 minutes, I was chatting with my fellow panelist, Eva Svedling, Sweden’s Deputy Foreign Minister, when she mentioned that former Vice President Al Gore was wrapping up a presentation in a meeting room on the opposite side of the Pavilion area. As an outspoken climate change icon, Mr. Gore is in high demand at these events, but I wanted to try to shake his hand and thank him for his climate advocacy. I hustled past the UK pavilion (whiskey tasting on Sunday!), the green, leafy Brazil pavilion, the French pavilion with its “Paris Agreement Café”, the warm and tropical Fiji host pavilion, and the elaborate lighting of the high tech India pavilion. Seeing a throng up ahead I knew I was in the right place, and soon spotted the VP being swarmed by well-wishers taking selfies and trying to shake his hand.So mobbed he could barely make his way through the crowd, the VP was patiently thanking everyone over and over. I tried to move in but no luck. For a moment the amoeba-like crowd movement pulled me in toward him, but just as quickly I was on the outside looking in. I decided to take a long-distance selfie and get back to the Nordic Pavilion for my talk.Just as I was turning to leave, a slender, be-suited young man took me by the arm and asked “Are you Joel Clement?” Puzzled, I said yes and his response stunned me: “He’d love to meet with you, can you come with us now?” For a half second I let it sink in that the vice president wanted to meet with me, and then I nearly said yes, throwing the Swedes under the bus, before coming to my senses. We set up a meeting for later in the day and I made it back to the Nordic pavilion in time for my session. In this dramatic and surprising way I was welcomed to the annual clima-palooza that brings the world’s climate thought-leaders together to fret and geek out on the most important issue of our time; an event where apparently a climate whistleblower has minor celebrity status.This was one of many interactions that reminded me of just how significant these COP meetings are, and it had nothing to do with the negotiations that were taking place over in the “Bula Zone,” the meeting space at the other end of Rheinaue Park that was reserved for official state delegations. While negotiators were grinding through the excruciating details of implementing the Paris Agreement, representatives from all of civil society were mingling in the “Bonn Zone”, a facility that was funded and built, remarkably, to facilitate international, cross-sector interactions on the threats and opportunities associated with climate change. To put it a different way, once a year there is a huge investment in fostering the international community of practice that is tackling the biggest challenge facing modern civilization. The negotiators get the press, but the world-changers are strolling around the pavilions, sitting in meeting rooms, and sharing ideas big and small that will change lives. At a time when the world seems focused on the negative effects of an unhinged, ignorant American president who questions the causes of climate change, it was invigorating to see so much energy dedicated to climate solutions.And, contrary to expectations, the Americans did not disappoint. With President Trump pledging to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement at the earliest opportunity, and with oil, gas, and coal interests running the executive branch of the U.S. government, expectations for the United States were beyond low. Sure enough, the official U.S. delegation remained cloistered in a closed-door meeting room and, for the first time, the U.S. didn’t even bother to host a pavilion. By ceding this role, however, the federal delegation created a huge opportunity for the rest of American civil society to step in. With generous funding from Michael Bloomberg and others, a massive “Climate Action Center” was inflated in the open area between the Bula Zone and the Bonn Zone pavilion space. I say inflated because it actually was an inflated structure that looked like a moon-bounce with multiple domes. At 2500 square meters, it was the largest pavilion at COP23.In this pavilion, leaders of 20 U.S. states, over 100 cities, and over 1,400 corporations pledged their allegiance to the Paris Agreement with the hashtag slogan #wearestillin, and described their own commitments to limiting greenhouse gas emissions. The parties to America’s Pledge, as their collective action was called, represented a combined economy larger than every nation on earth other than China and the United States. While questions remain about tracking and verifying these pledges, the American display of ambition more than compensated for the disgraceful rhetoric coming from the White House. America’s Pledge was warmly received by other national delegations and praised by heads of state such as France’s Emmanuel Macron and Germany’s Angela Merkel as they arrived in Bonn for the second week of deliberations. Standing on the sidelines, I indulged in a little American pride that this collective action would likely be the top headline from COP23.While the Bonn Zone and the Climate Action Center were highlighting these positive efforts to limit greenhouse gases, build resilience, and cooperate to help less affluent nations achieve their own goals, the Bula Zone was a more stressful environment. At this COP, negotiators were tasked with establishing the scope and details of the “rule book” that would assure transparent and fair implementation of the national pledges associated with the Paris Agreement. With the expectation that this rule book would be adopted at next year’s COP in Poland, there was considerable pressure to make significant headway, and by all accounts it was a slow, fraught, and not entirely successful process.As one might expect when creating rules of compliance, old tensions between developed and developing countries re-emerged. In particular, developing countries worried about being able to measure and report mitigation progress at the scale and detail that developed countries hoped to establish, and developed countries worried about consistent reporting protocols from all parties. The liability issues of “Loss and Damage” continued to vex the parties, who put off major decisions until next year, as did the finance details of relocating the Adaptation Fund – formerly linked to carbon markets under the Kyoto Protocol – to serve a Paris Agreement framework that has not yet established a shared position on such market mechanisms. And then there were the personalities. As usual, certain vocal delegations dominated the proceedings and the facilitators had to resort to accepting minimal, incremental progress – the lowest common denominator in many cases – to keep things moving along. This is part and parcel to international negotiations but it’s regrettable that the increased ambition and leadership that had been growing since COP21 in Paris was not as universal as it appeared over in the Bonn Zone. Not that the negotiations were a failure, there were several notable achievements. The Adaptation Fund was approved as a finance mechanism to serve the Paris Agreement and received some much-needed financial commitments; an “Ocean Pathway Partnership,” co-chaired by Sweden and Fiji, was launched to explore the interactions of climate change and the world’s oceans; a Gender Action Plan was approved with the intention of increasing the participation of women in UNFCCC deliberations; and a Local Communities and Indigenous People’s Platform was finalized as a means to give greater voice to indigenous people in the climate negotiations.Unfortunately the American “can-do” spirit on display in the Climate Action Center was lacking in the Bula Zone. While the Americans were less vocal than in previous years, President Trump’s intention to renegotiate the Agreement to be more favorable for Americans hung like a pall over the proceedings, as did uncertainties about US funding for the Green Climate Fund, an essential component of the UNFCCC that was established to provide developing countries with the necessary capacity to adapt.But those struggles almost seemed beside the point at this COP. Despite the typical lack of ambition in the Bula Zone, the commitment and ambition on display in the Bonn Zone and the Climate Action Center set the tone for COP23. Hundreds of climate solution projects and initiatives around the world were featured, and, rather than provide the international buzz-kill that was expected, Americans amplified the energy with America’s Pledge and other initiatives. Leaders like Al Gore, Michael Bloomberg, Governors Jerry Brown (CA) and Jay Inslee (WA), mayors from around the U.S., and the corporate titans they brought along showed that there is an abundance of ambition at the scale where change actually takes place. The Bonn-Fiji Commitment, announced toward the end of COP23, amplified this headline by taking the focus on local and regional-scale efforts to the international level.The negotiators still have to keep the work going in the bureaucratic trenches, but they will soon find themselves leading from behind as the rest of civil society advances forward. Maybe this is how it should be; there is no question that we need to accelerate climate action well beyond the speed limit of international negotiations. All I know is that my goosebumps in Bonn didn’t just come from an invigorating chat with Vice President Gore, they came from witnessing all that he and his fellow leaders from around the world brought to a momentous gathering by the banks of the Rhine River in 2017. #wearestillin"

25,POLITICS,"After Vegas And Texas Massacres, Republicans Try To Make It Easier To Carry Concealed Guns",Dana Liebelson and Igor Bobic,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gop-concealed-carry-gun-bill_us_5a2721c9e4b044d16725b033,"The House bill would “endanger people in states with stronger gun laws,"" said one gun-control advocate.",2017-12-06,"Homemade crosses honor the victims of the Nov. 5 shooting at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a27225d1900003f2c034b9d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― House Republicans are expected to vote as early as Wednesday on legislation to expand the ability of out-of-state visitors to carry concealed guns in places like Times Square or the streets of Los Angeles, effectively overriding strict state and local prohibitions. It is the first gun bill to receive a vote in Congress since a shooter mowed down concert-goers in Las Vegas and another opened fire at a Texas church.The bill, known as the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, would treat concealed carry permits, which allow people to carry a hidden weapon in public, more like driver’s licenses. Although many states already have some reciprocity, the measure would force all states to honor permits from other places, including those with much looser restrictions. Someone who gets a gun in Vermont, one of 12 states that allow people to carry concealed weapons without a permit, would be able to also carry it concealed in neighboring New York, a state where it’s much more difficult to get a license and where other states’ permits aren’t currently recognized. (The bill wouldn’t interfere with state laws that govern carrying on private or government property but would allow concealed carry in national parks.) Although Republicans are attaching a modest background check measure to the bill, the package would have the cumulative effect of making it legal for people to carry concealed weapons in more places. And it would “allow states with weak gun laws to endanger people in states with stronger gun laws, against the will of those states,” said Lindsay Nichols, federal policy director at Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a group named for former Rep. Gabby Giffords, who was shot in 2011. Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.), who introduced the bill, said he is a “big states’ rights guy” and argued that under the legislation states would still retain the rights to limit the types of firearms and exactly where they can be carried. He said it’s important to recognize the Constitution’s Full Faith and Credit Clause, which holds that each state must honor every other states’ public acts and records. “If I get married in North Carolina, if I move to California, I’m still married,” Hudson said. “Same thing with concealed carry. “Gun control advocates oppose the bill on the grounds that it forces some places to recognize dramatically weaker standards for concealed carry. A state that doesn’t issue permits to certain kinds of domestic violence offenders, for example, would have to accept a permit that was issued to an abuser in another state. A number of states also issue permits to non-residents, Nichols noted, meaning criminals could shop around for the place with the weakest law. And some law enforcement officials argue that the bill doesn’t take into account the different public safety challenges their cities face. “This legislation will make New York City less safe and our job as law enforcement significantly harder,” New York City Police Commissioner James O’Neill said earlier this year. The bill’s conservative defenders argue that in this case their right to bear arms trumps states’ rights concerns. The bill would “end abuses in anti-gun states,” said the National Rifle Association, which has championed the legislation as a priority.“Most of those who don’t like this are also the ones who want the U.S. to be this one homogeneous blur from sea to sea,” said Gary Marbut, president of the Montana Shooting Sports Association. “It’s darned disingenuous for them to be making a states’ rights argument only for this subject.” Opponents of the bill who invoked states’ rights were “reaching,” said Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), a prominent gun rights advocate. “The Tenth Amendment doesn’t trump the Second Amendment.” (If the bill passes, it would likely face legal challenges.) Gun rights advocates claim that it’s very rare for concealed carry permit holders to commit crimes and that “a good guy with a gun” shouldn’t be contained by state lines. And although the majority of permit holders are law-abiding citizens, at least 29 mass shootings since 2007 involved a perpetrator with a concealed carry license, according to an analysis by the Violence Policy Center, a nonprofit that advocates for gun control. (The Texas church shooter, Devin Kelley, reportedly tried to get a concealed carry permit in Texas but was denied.)House GOP leaders plan to pair the concealed carry bill with a separate measure that aims to shore up the federal background check system. (Kelley had purchased a firearm even though he had a prior conviction for domestic violence.) Moving the measures at the same time could offer members of both parties some incentive to go along.“From my standpoint, I didn’t want to put those two bills together, but I think the leadership’s determined to do that,” King told HuffPost on Tuesday. Even if the measure passes in the House, it would likely be dead on arrival in the Senate, however, where Republicans must convince at least eight Democrats to join them in order to overcome a legislative filibuster. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas), who is working on bipartisan background check legislation, poured cold water on the idea of pairing the bills last week. “I think it’s a mistake,” he said, according to The Daily Caller.Still, it’s revealing that in the wake of two of the most horrific mass shootings in recent U.S. history, Republicans are moving forward with legislation to expand gun rights. Some in the gun lobby are trying to sell bills like this one as something that “makes us safer and will reduce mass shootings,” said Avery Gardiner, co-president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. “They’re simply wrong.” "
26,POLITICS,How The GOP Tax Bill Will Impact Adoption Services,"Michelle Campbell, ContributorFounder of The Pillowcase Project, Activist, Humanitarian, Wor...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/when-the-movers-came_us_5a273cdce4b0650db4d40b9c,These “pro-family” Republicans want to get rid of the tax credit that assists families with adoption.,2017-12-06,<p>One of the only images I have of me before my adoption</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a2743db150000287a85bb53.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When I was 4, my parents were making a move from North Carolina to North Dakota. It was an exciting move for my parents, since they’re originally from North Dakota. It was a normal day. It was moving day. There was nothing extraordinary that stood out and it was like any other day, that a family in the United States would go through when relocating for a new job.It wasn’t a normal day for me. The day the movers came, I clutched onto my mothers leg, crying and telling them I don’t want to leave. But not because I didn’t want to leave my friends and the house I’d become familiar with. I cried and was terrified because not even a year prior, I had been in foster care and shuffled around. I didn’t know what was happening. I thought that the family that I had grown to become familiar with, was getting rid of me. I didn’t want to go.Today I read some of the issues that would be impacted by the GOP’s tax bill reform. A flood of emotion and heaviness overcame me. These “pro-family” Republicans want to get rid of the tax credit that assists families with adoption. They will also very likely succeed at doing this.I just want to be clear….the children who are being swept up into an unending cycle of being placed in the system and shuffled around, don’t matter? Believe me, I could go on and on about the other injustices happening to kids at this very moment across America, but today I’m focusing on this.I was in foster care for almost three years at the beginning of my life. I had no stability and security, didn’t know where I belonged, no unconditional love and didn’t know who I was. The first three years in a child’s life are also the most crucial. Ask any psychologist, psychiatrist or medical book. You don’t need a Ph.D. to know this and science has demonstrated what most people intuitively know; the bonds and attachments made in a child’s first three years of life are some of the most crucial. The stability of these relationships will serve as the foundation of that person’s future relationships and mental well being.People always tell me how lucky I am to have been adopted. They’re right. I was lucky. But the emotional scarring that happened during that time has and will always live within me as a now 39-year-old adult.The adoption tax credit took some of the financial burdens off of families who want to adopt, whether to help more children or because they couldn’t have children of their own. Guess what? The more families can financially afford to adopt, there will be fewer children rotting away unnoticed in a flawed foster care system.I’m not a victim and never want to come off as one, however, I can tell you first hand what children go through in the system and how they have zero control over their futures. They are voiceless. The wound can heal, but the emotional scars will never go away.Taking away a tax credit for families is an all out assault on parents who need the extra assistance to adopt, as well as an all out assault on the many children living in foster care that are waiting for a forever home.Do not tell me you are “pro-life and pro-family.” This is not an abortion debate, this is about giving a damn about children who need a home. There is something completely morally bankrupt and nonsensical in this kind of thinking. If you’re pro-life, then that should be all life. Supporting this tax bill is offensive and an attack on adoption hopefuls and the foster kids in this country.To the families, couples and even single adults out there who could be affected by this and won’t be able to afford adoption, I’m sorry. To the many foster kids out there who have been abandoned and lost in the system, I’m with you and I will fight for you."

Oliver Schmidt ― a German native who worked in the U.S. as Volkswagen’s top emissions compliance manager ― had pleaded guilty in August to two charges in the case of Volkswagen altering its diesel cars to evade U.S. emission standards, reported The Detroit News. One charge was conspiracy to defraud the U.S., and the other was violating the Clean Air Act. “This crime ... attacks and destroys the very foundation of our economic system: That is trust,” U.S. District Judge Sean Cox of Detroit said in court, according to the outlet. In September 2015, the German automaker admitted it had rigged close to 11 million cars worldwide ― including 500,000 cars in the U.S. ― with secret software that would cheat on emissions tests to appear more environmentally friendly. The scandal has cost the company close to $30 billion. Other executives from Volkswagen, as well as the company itself, are still under investigation in Germany and facing lawsuits from investors in the U.S.Earlier this year, former Volkswagen engineer James Liang was sentenced to 40 months in prison for his role in the scandal. Liang has since appealed his sentence. At the time, the same judge, Cox, ordered Liang to pay a $200,000 fine ― 10 times the amount sought by federal prosecutors, reported Reuters. The judge said Liang had participated in a “stunning fraud on the American consumer ... a very serious and troubling crime against our economic system.” "

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a280d87150000e09f85bcfe.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Surging temperatures and risings seas already threaten to upend industries from real estate to agriculture to insurance, leaving coastal properties swamped, outdoor workers overheated, and policies vulnerable to catastrophic new risks.Add manufacturing to that list. One extra day of temperatures above 90 degrees Fahrenheit costs the average Chinese manufacturing plant roughly $10,000 in 2017 dollars in lost output, according to research released last month. The study, published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, tracked temperatures and daily churn at half a million Chinese plants from 1998 to 2007. In 2050, those losses are on pace to balloon to more than $47.2 billion in 2017 dollars as the world’s biggest manufacturing country loses 12 percent of its factory output each year. That equates to about 4 percent of annual gross domestic product in a country where 32 percent of GDP comes from manufacturing. In one particularly striking result, the researchers found that high-tech manufacturers ― those producing medical supplies, aerospace equipment and computer parts ― are just as sensitive to extreme temperature as low-tech sectors, such as apparel and textiles. “China is the de-facto factory for the world,” Kyle Meng, a co-author of the study and an assistant professor of environmental economics at the University of California at Santa Barbara, wrote in an email to HuffPost. “Losses in the Chinese manufacturing sector can have ripple effects on consumer prices around the world, including the U.S.” The vast differences between the United States and Chinese economies make it difficult to draw conclusions about the future of American manufacturing sectors, Meng said.During his campaign, President Donald Trump promised to kickstart a renaissance in U.S. manufacturing by lowering corporate taxes and slashing regulations. The National Association of Manufacturers began lobbying early in his administration against climate change regulations, renewable energy and higher vehicle emissions standards. The group has spent nearly $4.4 million on lobbying in 2017 alone, according to data collated by the Center for Responsive Politics.  The nation’s top manufacturing lobby also urged the new president to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. In June, Trump announced plans to pull the U.S. out of the accord in November 2020, when the treaty allows for formal withdrawal, and canceled future payments to a United Nations-administered fund to help poor countries vulnerable to sea level rise build up their renewable energy infrastructure and prepare for climate change.  China, by contrast, ramped up its role in the Paris agreement. In May, just a month before Trump’s long-anticipated announcement, Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged to spend $900 billion on infrastructure abroad, namely on renewable energy projects. In June, Xi met with California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) to discuss ways to cooperate on reducing emissions despite the Trump administration’s retreat from the climate issue. Beijing vowed to spend at least $350 billion on renewable energy by 2020, and has plans for what the Financial Times called a “super-grid for clean power” across Asia. Yet the country’s increased coal use ― despite canceling plans for 103 new coal-fired plants ― sent global carbon dioxide emissions surging for the first time in three years, scientists announced last month. And the economic measures China used when calculating its Paris agreement pledges don’t include manufacturing losses from extreme heat, Meng said.Plus, Meng’s study only looked at soaring temperatures ― just one side effect of a planet increasingly warmed by greenhouse gas emissions. “At the moment, we don’t have much to say about how other conditions under climate change such as sea level rise, trough, or storms will affect economic activity,” he said. “We leave that for future work.”"

They depicted, in undone but strangely fluent lines, iconic Disney characters — Mickey Mouse, Bambi and Goofy, among others. When Mary asked her mother, Virginia, where they came from, Virginia explained that she made them, years ago, while working for Walt Disney.Mary was floored. She knew her mother only as a stay-at-home mom. “I was like, what?” she recalled in an interview with HuffPost. “You were a cool person who worked for Disney?”The discovery of the trashed Disney drawings astounded Mary, now a successful comic artist in her 60s, for two reasons. First, there was the shocking realization that her mother had a secret career as a professional animator. Just as confounding, however, was the subsequent revelation that every single frame of every single animated movie she loved was made by a human hand. “It hit me that this stuff was drawn by people,” she said.By people, yes. And often, in some way or another, by women.According to Walt Disney himself, women were ideal candidates for his company’s early ink and paint department, responsible for bringing dimension, depth, detail and color to early 20th-century animators’ drawings. Mindy Johnson writes as much in her book Ink & Paint: The Women of Walt Disney’s Animation. Sure, it was the animators, predominantly men, who were responsible for drafting Disney characters’ initial forms and movements ― and as the originators, they were viewed as the “most-skilled artists,” Johnson notes. But it was the inkers and painters who stepped in after the animators’ job was done, to refine and enhance their designs.The jobs required immense composure and precision, traits frequently associated with femininity at the time. As a press release from Walt Disney Studios in the 1920s explained, “Girls not only have more patience and a finer sense for detail, line, and color — they have infinitely more patience to do a more finished type of work so necessary for this work on celluloids.”In the 1920s and throughout the 1930s, the ink and paint department was the only creative department in the Disney Studios open to women. Even more disheartening, the department recruited only those under the age of 35. One call for artists from the time, discovered by Johnson, reads: “Women over thirty-five have shown that their muscles start to stiffen and that they cannot master a pen and brush technique so well as younger girls.”Around 1934, however, Disney began to make more of a concerted effort to incorporate women into the workplace. Beyond working as secretaries and stenographers, a few also climbed the ranks of the company’s creative fields. Bianca Majolie started at Disney that year, eventually becoming the first woman to work as a storyboard artist, the lone woman in a room with 15 men. While the men prided themselves on slapstick humor and silly gags, Majolie incorporated emotion into her story arcs, which would become a staple of Disney’s animation formula. She eventually created story outlines for classics like “Cinderella” and “Peter Pan.” Hazel Sewell, Walt Disney’s sister-in-law, also made waves as an art director in the 1920s, working on films like “Snow White” and “Bambi.” Yet the majority of women still worked in ink and paint, where they were separated out from the rest of their colleagues in a self-contained wing of Disney’s Burbank offices. Johnson believes the gender segregation stemmed, in part, from an effort to keep women ― new to the workplace environment dominated by men ― relatively comfortable. But the quarantine was also a safety precaution. The ink and paint department worked with nitrate cellulose, a highly flammable material, so it was necessary for the department’s employees to operate in a contained workspace. If a cigarette-smoking animator were to drop by, for example, he could set the department alight. “Even the slightest speck of dust, on screen, looked like a boulder,” Johnson told HuffPost. “You couldn’t have people traipsing though; it had to be a controlled and contained environment. “This was not Betty Crocker’s kitchen,” she added. “This was Madame Curie’s lab.”Since she was a young child, Virginia Fleener dreamed of being a costume designer, of translating her love of drawing into some kind of career. “My mother was a seamstress,” the 95-year-old told HuffPost. “I grew up loving the feel of materials.”But Fleener’s aspirations changed course when she entered college, fell in love and got married. “I decided I wanted to have some children and be a housewife, a homemaker,” she said. Then in 1941, less than a year after her wedding, Fleener’s husband was drafted by the Navy to fight in World War II. Like many women at the time, Fleener suddenly found herself in need of a job.Meanwhile, the war had thrown Disney’s cartooning department into chaos. Some employees enlisted, others were drafted, and those who remained were relegated to making war-related training videos. Almost overnight, Johnson said, the campus came to resemble a military base. Employees had to wear ID badges, as well as sign in and sign out every day.“You didn’t know what you were working on because, in order to keep the studio going, they were making a lot of military training films, a lot of which were top secret,” Johnson said. As for the ink and paint department, it was down to almost half its size in ’41 compared to the year prior. So the Disney Studios began distributing messages to local art schools throughout Los Angeles and placing ads in local papers. One read: “Do you want a career in art? Walt Disney needs young women who have had training in pen and ink work, now! A real opportunity for the girl who excels.”Virginia Fleener saw one such ad, applied and ― at 20 years old ― got the gig. “It was a very nice place to work at the time,” Fleener recalled. “One time I got on the elevator, and there was Walt Disney!”She began in the ink and paint department in 1942, but just a few weeks later, Fleener was transferred to the animation department, the section of Disney off limits to women a decade before. “The Studio will lose quite a few of its men to the armed forces,” detailed a 1942 memo from the Walt Disney Studios archives. “Should many more be called, it is not impossible that girls will be trained for jobs now held only by men.”Soon women were working in the camera and editorial departments, and because Disney was unionized, the women were able to vie for fair compensation. “They put down their brushes and picked up pencils,” Johnson said.After the war, however, many men returned to their previous Disney posts, pushing women back into inking and painting. Their pay, if increased in the war-time era, was docked as well, Johnson said.Fleener doesn’t remember feeling discriminated against at her workplace. When asked if she ever faced sexism or any sort of gender-based harassment, she responded, “We didn’t think that way then. We heard about things going on in Hollywood. There was always gossip, but we didn’t know whether it was true.”Fleener was one of the first women to break into the boys’ club of animation, and many more followed suit. Jane Baer started working at Disney in 1954 as an animator for “Sleeping Beauty.” At 20 years old, Baer was one of 10 women brought on for the film, all of whom worked together in a big room Baer referred to as the “bullpen.” She is the only one still alive today.“They thought hiring girls was a good idea because we had the right delicate touch to do the fine lines on princess Aurora,” Baer told HuffPost.Baer, now 83, grew up in Winnipeg, Canada, where she lived what she called a “regular life.” Her parents had saved enough money to send one of their children to college ― Baer’s brother. “Why waste it on a girl?” Baer said. “In their minds, I would just get married and have babies and that would be that.”Although her father had encouraged her to take art classes growing up, he never considered the possibility that his daughter could see drawing as anything more than a hobby. “We were expected to be stenographers and secretaries ― to get married and have babies,” Baer said. “My mother never worked after she got married, never drove a car. It was just different.”Yet Baer, who described herself as “very stubborn,” was undeterred. Set on becoming an artist like her dad, Baer decided the first step on her path to a career was attending the ArtCenter College of Design in California. “If I was told I couldn’t do something, I would try to do it,” she said. “My father wouldn’t finance my ArtCenter venture, but I was going to do it one way or another.”Baer was accepted to ArtCenter and paid tuition herself with money she earned working as a graphic designer at the time. She bunked with an older Texan woman who had recently gone through her fifth divorce, and Baer earned her keep by cooking and cleaning. Shortly after she graduated, luckily enough, Disney was hiring.The women working on “Sleeping Beauty” became fast friends, in part, Baer said, because the competitive atmosphere common in male-dominated workspaces was absent. Like Baer, many of the women she worked with were raised to be secretaries, wives and mothers.“We didn’t have any aspirations to do anything more than what we were doing,” she said. “We weren’t discouraged but we also weren’t encouraged to become top animators. We were content, to a degree, doing what we did.”Although gender stereotypes potentially capped Baer’s ambition, she said her experiences with men in the workplace were overall positive. “The [men] would come by after lunch and tease [the women] and keep us from working,” she said. “We got blamed for encouraging it. But there was no sexual stuff that I was aware of. There were no Harvey Weinsteins, at least to my knowledge. The old men treated us very nicely.”Baer worked on Disney films including “The Black Cauldron” and “The Prince and the Pauper.” In 1984, she opened her own animation studio, Baer Animation, with her husband at the time, Dale Baer. She later worked on the iconic “Who Filmed Roger Rabbit,” creating the dizzying Toon Town sequence. But it was Baer’s first film, “Sleeping Beauty,” that inspired a young Gretchen Albright when she was a kid.The classic fairy tale was Albright’s favorite movie. “I’d pretend I was getting the characters ready for their performance with these stickers my mom got me,” she recalled.Albright, now 67, was drawn to the film industry from a young age, in part because her father worked as a grip for 50 years. She never imagined herself pursuing animation, but in 1972, after she’d graduated from UCLA with a French degree, she saw Disney was hiring in their Xerox department. She applied and got the job. “It’s not like the Xerox machine that most people are familiar with,” Albright warned. “It is a three-room process.”Before long, Albright was transferred to the ink and paint department as a painter. To her, the job felt like the grown-up extension of a ritual she cherished so much as a child, dressing up “Sleeping Beauty” stickers in pretty outfits. “In painting you were doing just that,” she said, “putting colors onto the characters so they could perform in their final stages. It was just amazing, I thought, ‘I cannot believe I get paid to do this.’”Because of her grueling work hours, Albright said, she and the other women in ink and paint “bonded like sisters.” Together, they worked on Disney classics including “The Little Mermaid” and, her personal favorite, “The Lion King.” Albright’s tenure was long enough that she spent time in every part of ink and paint, eventually running the entire division, and proceeded to help usher Disney animators into the digital age. In all her time at Disney, she said, she recalled only one minor incident with a male colleague.“A male co-worker was carrying this massive phone-looking thing past the paint lab and I made some remark about it being quite large. He said something like, ‘Want to try it out?’ I thought, ‘Oh, that’s not quite the right thing to say.’ But he probably thought he was being funny. It never happened again.”The Disney offices Albright remembers were still somewhat segregated by gender at the time. When she started there she noticed “there was a club-type thing on the third floor of the animation building that was pretty much men only.” Albright didn’t think too much about it, especially given that her realm of the office was all women. “I was more interested in what we were doing than who we were doing it with,” she added.Virginia Fleener didn’t recall experiencing any off-color remarks from men at work, but her daughter Mary remembered one strange incident involving, appropriately enough for the animation world, a drawing. Mary said that one day when she was about 21, her mother ducked out of work to go to a dentist appointment. When Virginia returned, there was a drawing on her desk of a woman in a dentist chair with a man peering so deeply into her throat he was inside her. The caption read: “This might hurt a little.”“There was flirtation back then. It wasn’t all squeaky clean,” Mary said of her mother’s era. “She has a lot of caricatures men drew of her. A lot of these guys were probably up to no good like they are today. Even though they were drawing Bambi, they were dirty old men.”Baer, Fleener and Albright all attested that their workplaces were, overall, safe spaces for women to cultivate their skills, different from the toxic and misogynist environments described in recent news stories. Earlier this month, Disney Animation head John Lasseter announced that he was taking a leave of absence from Pixar, following accusations of behavior that left his co-workers feeling “disrespected or uncomfortable.” It is possible predatory bosses were not as prevalent in the ’40s, ’50s, ’60s and ’70s as they appear to be today, but it seems likely the behavior we now recognize as problematic was perceived as normal in mid-century workplaces.Included in Johnson’s book is an excerpt from a 1919 secretarial guidebook detailing how women should react if their male superiors acted inappropriately. Although it wasn’t culled from the Disney vault, it speaks to the behaviors expected of women at the time. “She must learn not to see that his glance is too fervid, not to feel that hand that rests on hers.” If a woman was to respond, she should do so with “tact and politeness, for it is not the rebuff that counts so much as the way in which it is done.”Looking back, Baer concluded that Disney was more patriarchal an atmosphere than she realized at the time. But she’s confident that, with time, the climate has changed. “There is still a boys’ club going on, but the door is getting pushed open now, thank God,” she said. “The mindset is opening up and fresh. It isn’t closed to women like it was. Even though it was never spoken about, it was there. You just knew not to push it too much or you’d be classified as a pushy broad. Not today. It’s very encouraging.”Today, Jane Baer is 83, Gretchen Albright is 67 and Virginia Fleener is 95. Many of their co-workers are no longer living, but the three women look with warmth, if not utter amazement, at the next generation of comic artists, especially the women, who have the high expectations and big dreams they didn’t.“In today’s world, women can do anything,” Baer said. “I went to an animation convention over the weekend and was amazed by the number of young women there with incredible talent interested in all facets of animation. I was blown away. The door is pretty much wide open.”Today’s young women animators surely benefited from women like Baer, Albright and Fleener, who proved that women have far more to offer the world of animation than a “delicate touch.” Women are now represented in almost every aspect of production, though still in lackluster percentages. In 2015, women made up 10 percent of animation directors and producers, 17 percent of writers, 21 percent of art/designers and 23 percent of animators, according to the Animation Guild. Organizations like Women in Animation are devoted to tipping the scales further; it is currently working toward equal employment for men and women on animation productions by the year 2025.Mary Fleener, in particular, attributes much of her success to the fact that she grew up with a “mother who did art when she wanted, the way she wanted. I inherited her art genes and I would use her art supplies.”Mary’s work is a far cry from Virginia’s. Instead of smiley princesses and anthropomorphized woodland creatures, Mary draws bawdy, underground, feminist comics including her semi-autobiographical series “Slutburger Stories.” The name riffs off a derogatory term for a promiscuous woman.The cover of the first edition of “Slutburger” features a woman in a cubist style, as if made by Picasso’s feminist cousin with a soft spot for hallucinogens. The surreal babe sits in an oversized martini glass, her green, pink, purple and yellow legs fanning out beneath her in multicolored high heels. Her face is a jigsaw puzzle; her many arms cast her as a party girl Kali ― she uses some to pose, others to caress herself, giving shape to the constant multitasking intrinsic to the feminine experience.There is a magic to Disney’s “Sleeping Beauty,” which tells of beautiful princess Aurora who is cursed by the evil fairy Maleficent to remain in a deep sleep until true love’s kiss awakens her. Yet the classic film, based off the story by Charles Perrault, doesn’t do much for gender representation in 2017. After all, Princess Aurora spends most of the story unconscious. But without an animated character like Aurora, who Disney bosses thought required a woman’s hand to render, there may never have been a Slutburger, bursting out of a martini glass with her nipples exposed.Aurora might live happily ever after, but Slutburger gets to live on her own terms."

Earlier this month, Disney Animation head John Lasseter announced that he was taking a leave of absence from Pixar, following accusations of behavior that left his co-workers feeling “disrespected or uncomfortable.” It is possible predatory bosses were not as prevalent in the ’40s, ’50s, ’60s and ’70s as they appear to be today, but it seems likely the behavior we now recognize as problematic was perceived as normal in mid-century workplaces.Included in Johnson’s book is an excerpt from a 1919 secretarial guidebook detailing how women should react if their male superiors acted inappropriately. Although it wasn’t culled from the Disney vault, it speaks to the behaviors expected of women at the time. “She must learn not to see that his glance is too fervid, not to feel that hand that rests on hers.” If a woman was to respond, she should do so with “tact and politeness, for it is not the rebuff that counts so much as the way in which it is done.”Looking back, Baer concluded that Disney was more patriarchal an atmosphere than she realized at the time. But she’s confident that, with time, the climate has changed. “There is still a boys’ club going on, but the door is getting pushed open now, thank God,” she said. “The mindset is opening up and fresh. It isn’t closed to women like it was. Even though it was never spoken about, it was there. You just knew not to push it too much or you’d be classified as a pushy broad. Not today. It’s very encouraging.”Today, Jane Baer is 83, Gretchen Albright is 67 and Virginia Fleener is 95. Many of their co-workers are no longer living, but the three women look with warmth, if not utter amazement, at the next generation of comic artists, especially the women, who have the high expectations and big dreams they didn’t.“In today’s world, women can do anything,” Baer said. “I went to an animation convention over the weekend and was amazed by the number of young women there with incredible talent interested in all facets of animation. I was blown away. The door is pretty much wide open.”Today’s young women animators surely benefited from women like Baer, Albright and Fleener, who proved that women have far more to offer the world of animation than a “delicate touch.” Women are now represented in almost every aspect of production, though still in lackluster percentages. In 2015, women made up 10 percent of animation directors and producers, 17 percent of writers, 21 percent of art/designers and 23 percent of animators, according to the Animation Guild. Organizations like Women in Animation are devoted to tipping the scales further; it is currently working toward equal employment for men and women on animation productions by the year 2025.Mary Fleener, in particular, attributes much of her success to the fact that she grew up with a “mother who did art when she wanted, the way she wanted. I inherited her art genes and I would use her art supplies.”Mary’s work is a far cry from Virginia’s. Instead of smiley princesses and anthropomorphized woodland creatures, Mary draws bawdy, underground, feminist comics including her semi-autobiographical series “Slutburger Stories.” The name riffs off a derogatory term for a promiscuous woman.The cover of the first edition of “Slutburger” features a woman in a cubist style, as if made by Picasso’s feminist cousin with a soft spot for hallucinogens. The surreal babe sits in an oversized martini glass, her green, pink, purple and yellow legs fanning out beneath her in multicolored high heels. Her face is a jigsaw puzzle; her many arms cast her as a party girl Kali ― she uses some to pose, others to caress herself, giving shape to the constant multitasking intrinsic to the feminine experience.There is a magic to Disney’s “Sleeping Beauty,” which tells of beautiful princess Aurora who is cursed by the evil fairy Maleficent to remain in a deep sleep until true love’s kiss awakens her. Yet the classic film, based off the story by Charles Perrault, doesn’t do much for gender representation in 2017. After all, Princess Aurora spends most of the story unconscious. But without an animated character like Aurora, who Disney bosses thought required a woman’s hand to render, there may never have been a Slutburger, bursting out of a martini glass with her nipples exposed.Aurora might live happily ever after, but Slutburger gets to live on her own terms."

Their path to success was anything but easy.",2017-12-06,"Hazel Sewell leads Disney's ink and paint department, circa 1934.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a26b9ac1500002e9d85b92a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"When Mary Fleener was 8 years old, she was snooping around her family’s basement when she stumbled on a trove of unfinished drawings. They depicted, in undone but strangely fluent lines, iconic Disney characters — Mickey Mouse, Bambi and Goofy, among others. When Mary asked her mother, Virginia, where they came from, Virginia explained that she made them, years ago, while working for Walt Disney.Mary was floored. She knew her mother only as a stay-at-home mom. “I was like, what?” she recalled in an interview with HuffPost. “You were a cool person who worked for Disney?”The discovery of the trashed Disney drawings astounded Mary, now a successful comic artist in her 60s, for two reasons. First, there was the shocking realization that her mother had a secret career as a professional animator. Just as confounding, however, was the subsequent revelation that every single frame of every single animated movie she loved was made by a human hand. “It hit me that this stuff was drawn by people,” she said.By people, yes. And often, in some way or another, by women.According to Walt Disney himself, women were ideal candidates for his company’s early ink and paint department, responsible for bringing dimension, depth, detail and color to early 20th-century animators’ drawings. Mindy Johnson writes as much in her book Ink & Paint: The Women of Walt Disney’s Animation. Sure, it was the animators, predominantly men, who were responsible for drafting Disney characters’ initial forms and movements ― and as the originators, they were viewed as the “most-skilled artists,” Johnson notes. But it was the inkers and painters who stepped in after the animators’ job was done, to refine and enhance their designs.The jobs required immense composure and precision, traits frequently associated with femininity at the time. As a press release from Walt Disney Studios in the 1920s explained, “Girls not only have more patience and a finer sense for detail, line, and color — they have infinitely more patience to do a more finished type of work so necessary for this work on celluloids.”In the 1920s and throughout the 1930s, the ink and paint department was the only creative department in the Disney Studios open to women. Even more disheartening, the department recruited only those under the age of 35. One call for artists from the time, discovered by Johnson, reads: “Women over thirty-five have shown that their muscles start to stiffen and that they cannot master a pen and brush technique so well as younger girls.”Around 1934, however, Disney began to make more of a concerted effort to incorporate women into the workplace. Beyond working as secretaries and stenographers, a few also climbed the ranks of the company’s creative fields. Bianca Majolie started at Disney that year, eventually becoming the first woman to work as a storyboard artist, the lone woman in a room with 15 men. While the men prided themselves on slapstick humor and silly gags, Majolie incorporated emotion into her story arcs, which would become a staple of Disney’s animation formula. She eventually created story outlines for classics like “Cinderella” and “Peter Pan.” Hazel Sewell, Walt Disney’s sister-in-law, also made waves as an art director in the 1920s, working on films like “Snow White” and “Bambi.” Yet the majority of women still worked in ink and paint, where they were separated out from the rest of their colleagues in a self-contained wing of Disney’s Burbank offices. Johnson believes the gender segregation stemmed, in part, from an effort to keep women ― new to the workplace environment dominated by men ― relatively comfortable. But the quarantine was also a safety precaution. The ink and paint department worked with nitrate cellulose, a highly flammable material, so it was necessary for the department’s employees to operate in a contained workspace. If a cigarette-smoking animator were to drop by, for example, he could set the department alight. “Even the slightest speck of dust, on screen, looked like a boulder,” Johnson told HuffPost. “You couldn’t have people traipsing though; it had to be a controlled and contained environment. “This was not Betty Crocker’s kitchen,” she added. “This was Madame Curie’s lab.”Since she was a young child, Virginia Fleener dreamed of being a costume designer, of translating her love of drawing into some kind of career. “My mother was a seamstress,” the 95-year-old told HuffPost. “I grew up loving the feel of materials.”But Fleener’s aspirations changed course when she entered college, fell in love and got married. “I decided I wanted to have some children and be a housewife, a homemaker,” she said. Then in 1941, less than a year after her wedding, Fleener’s husband was drafted by the Navy to fight in World War II. Like many women at the time, Fleener suddenly found herself in need of a job.Meanwhile, the war had thrown Disney’s cartooning department into chaos. Some employees enlisted, others were drafted, and those who remained were relegated to making war-related training videos. Almost overnight, Johnson said, the campus came to resemble a military base. Employees had to wear ID badges, as well as sign in and sign out every day.“You didn’t know what you were working on because, in order to keep the studio going, they were making a lot of military training films, a lot of which were top secret,” Johnson said. As for the ink and paint department, it was down to almost half its size in ’41 compared to the year prior. So the Disney Studios began distributing messages to local art schools throughout Los Angeles and placing ads in local papers. One read: “Do you want a career in art? Walt Disney needs young women who have had training in pen and ink work, now! A real opportunity for the girl who excels.”Virginia Fleener saw one such ad, applied and ― at 20 years old ― got the gig. “It was a very nice place to work at the time,” Fleener recalled. “One time I got on the elevator, and there was Walt Disney!”She began in the ink and paint department in 1942, but just a few weeks later, Fleener was transferred to the animation department, the section of Disney off limits to women a decade before. “The Studio will lose quite a few of its men to the armed forces,” detailed a 1942 memo from the Walt Disney Studios archives. “Should many more be called, it is not impossible that girls will be trained for jobs now held only by men.”Soon women were working in the camera and editorial departments, and because Disney was unionized, the women were able to vie for fair compensation. “They put down their brushes and picked up pencils,” Johnson said.After the war, however, many men returned to their previous Disney posts, pushing women back into inking and painting. Their pay, if increased in the war-time era, was docked as well, Johnson said.Fleener doesn’t remember feeling discriminated against at her workplace. When asked if she ever faced sexism or any sort of gender-based harassment, she responded, “We didn’t think that way then. We heard about things going on in Hollywood. There was always gossip, but we didn’t know whether it was true.”Fleener was one of the first women to break into the boys’ club of animation, and many more followed suit. Jane Baer started working at Disney in 1954 as an animator for “Sleeping Beauty.” At 20 years old, Baer was one of 10 women brought on for the film, all of whom worked together in a big room Baer referred to as the “bullpen.” She is the only one still alive today.“They thought hiring girls was a good idea because we had the right delicate touch to do the fine lines on princess Aurora,” Baer told HuffPost.Baer, now 83, grew up in Winnipeg, Canada, where she lived what she called a “regular life.” Her parents had saved enough money to send one of their children to college ― Baer’s brother. “Why waste it on a girl?” Baer said. “In their minds, I would just get married and have babies and that would be that.”Although her father had encouraged her to take art classes growing up, he never considered the possibility that his daughter could see drawing as anything more than a hobby. “We were expected to be stenographers and secretaries ― to get married and have babies,” Baer said. “My mother never worked after she got married, never drove a car. It was just different.”Yet Baer, who described herself as “very stubborn,” was undeterred. Set on becoming an artist like her dad, Baer decided the first step on her path to a career was attending the ArtCenter College of Design in California. “If I was told I couldn’t do something, I would try to do it,” she said. “My father wouldn’t finance my ArtCenter venture, but I was going to do it one way or another.”Baer was accepted to ArtCenter and paid tuition herself with money she earned working as a graphic designer at the time. She bunked with an older Texan woman who had recently gone through her fifth divorce, and Baer earned her keep by cooking and cleaning. Shortly after she graduated, luckily enough, Disney was hiring.The women working on “Sleeping Beauty” became fast friends, in part, Baer said, because the competitive atmosphere common in male-dominated workspaces was absent. Like Baer, many of the women she worked with were raised to be secretaries, wives and mothers.“We didn’t have any aspirations to do anything more than what we were doing,” she said. “We weren’t discouraged but we also weren’t encouraged to become top animators. We were content, to a degree, doing what we did.”Although gender stereotypes potentially capped Baer’s ambition, she said her experiences with men in the workplace were overall positive. “The [men] would come by after lunch and tease [the women] and keep us from working,” she said. “We got blamed for encouraging it. But there was no sexual stuff that I was aware of. There were no Harvey Weinsteins, at least to my knowledge. The old men treated us very nicely.”Baer worked on Disney films including “The Black Cauldron” and “The Prince and the Pauper.” In 1984, she opened her own animation studio, Baer Animation, with her husband at the time, Dale Baer. She later worked on the iconic “Who Filmed Roger Rabbit,” creating the dizzying Toon Town sequence. But it was Baer’s first film, “Sleeping Beauty,” that inspired a young Gretchen Albright when she was a kid.The classic fairy tale was Albright’s favorite movie. “I’d pretend I was getting the characters ready for their performance with these stickers my mom got me,” she recalled.Albright, now 67, was drawn to the film industry from a young age, in part because her father worked as a grip for 50 years. She never imagined herself pursuing animation, but in 1972, after she’d graduated from UCLA with a French degree, she saw Disney was hiring in their Xerox department. She applied and got the job. “It’s not like the Xerox machine that most people are familiar with,” Albright warned. “It is a three-room process.”Before long, Albright was transferred to the ink and paint department as a painter. To her, the job felt like the grown-up extension of a ritual she cherished so much as a child, dressing up “Sleeping Beauty” stickers in pretty outfits. “In painting you were doing just that,” she said, “putting colors onto the characters so they could perform in their final stages. It was just amazing, I thought, ‘I cannot believe I get paid to do this.’”Because of her grueling work hours, Albright said, she and the other women in ink and paint “bonded like sisters.” Together, they worked on Disney classics including “The Little Mermaid” and, her personal favorite, “The Lion King.” Albright’s tenure was long enough that she spent time in every part of ink and paint, eventually running the entire division, and proceeded to help usher Disney animators into the digital age. In all her time at Disney, she said, she recalled only one minor incident with a male colleague.“A male co-worker was carrying this massive phone-looking thing past the paint lab and I made some remark about it being quite large. He said something like, ‘Want to try it out?’ I thought, ‘Oh, that’s not quite the right thing to say.’ But he probably thought he was being funny. It never happened again.”The Disney offices Albright remembers were still somewhat segregated by gender at the time. When she started there she noticed “there was a club-type thing on the third floor of the animation building that was pretty much men only.” Albright didn’t think too much about it, especially given that her realm of the office was all women. “I was more interested in what we were doing than who we were doing it with,” she added.Virginia Fleener didn’t recall experiencing any off-color remarks from men at work, but her daughter Mary remembered one strange incident involving, appropriately enough for the animation world, a drawing. Mary said that one day when she was about 21, her mother ducked out of work to go to a dentist appointment. When Virginia returned, there was a drawing on her desk of a woman in a dentist chair with a man peering so deeply into her throat he was inside her. The caption read: “This might hurt a little.”“There was flirtation back then. It wasn’t all squeaky clean,” Mary said of her mother’s era. “She has a lot of caricatures men drew of her. A lot of these guys were probably up to no good like they are today. Even though they were drawing Bambi, they were dirty old men.”Baer, Fleener and Albright all attested that their workplaces were, overall, safe spaces for women to cultivate their skills, different from the toxic and misogynist environments described in recent news stories. Earlier this month, Disney Animation head John Lasseter announced that he was taking a leave of absence from Pixar, following accusations of behavior that left his co-workers feeling “disrespected or uncomfortable.” It is possible predatory bosses were not as prevalent in the ’40s, ’50s, ’60s and ’70s as they appear to be today, but it seems likely the behavior we now recognize as problematic was perceived as normal in mid-century workplaces.Included in Johnson’s book is an excerpt from a 1919 secretarial guidebook detailing how women should react if their male superiors acted inappropriately.

But she’s confident that, with time, the climate has changed. “There is still a boys’ club going on, but the door is getting pushed open now, thank God,” she said. “The mindset is opening up and fresh. It isn’t closed to women like it was. Even though it was never spoken about, it was there. You just knew not to push it too much or you’d be classified as a pushy broad. Not today.

Now the California sheriff’s office is saying differently.Feldman, 46, has long insisted there are people in Hollywood who are guilty of abusing child actors. He has alleged that actor Jon Grissom and former child talent manager and convicted sex offender Martin Weiss both molested him when he was younger. Feldman said he went to the police in 1993 and nothing happened. Fearful of retaliation, he never went back to the authorities.Now, the authorities say they have found the tapes from Feldman’s 1993 visit to the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office.In a statement first released Tuesday night, Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office public information officer Kelly Hoover wrote:Following the recent inquiries into the Sheriff’s Office interview of Mr. Feldman in 1993, the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office conducted an additional review for any stored items remaining from the Michael Jackson investigation. In a container which included the original reports from the investigation, the Sheriff’s Office located some detective working copies of audio recordings made during the investigation. A copy of Mr. Feldman’s interview was located. The recording is being turned over to the Los Angeles Police Department.Discovery of the tapes comes in the midst of an explosion of sexual predator claims. Ever since film executive Harvey Weinstein was accused of widespread sexual misconduct, the dominos have fallen in quick succession with figures in business, media, Hollywood and politics being called out by victims. Time magazine just named The Silence Breakers, whom the magazine described as “the individuals who set off a national reckoning over the prevalence of sexual harassment,” as its Person of the Year.Feldman has been trying to raise $10 million to make a movie about the sexual abuse he experienced within the entertainment industry, with the ultimate goal of exposing more abusers. According to Vanity Fair, he alleged that the people he’s up against are “major power players in Hollywood and beyond. They’ve already tried to tarnish his career — even tried to kill him.”HuffPost has reached out to Feldman and the Los Angeles Police Department, but did not immediately receive comment."

The National Weather Service said the Los Angeles region was under an extreme fire danger warning through Friday and said it expected the winds to continue throughout the week in the “strongest and longest Santa Ana event so far this season.”Just after 5 a.m. local time on Wednesday, a new brush fire dubbed the Skirball Fire took over 50 acres in Bel-Air. Video of it spreading uphill along the 405 freeway shows the surrounding hills glowing from the flames that have since forced the highway to shut down, the Los Angeles Times reported.Within roughly four hours, the fire had grown to 150 acres with 0 percent contained, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department.The nearby J. Paul Getty Museum, which houses European artwork and has closed amid the fires, announced on Twitter that its air filtration systems are working to protect its galleries from the surrounding smoke.California Gov. Jerry Brown has declared a state of emergency,“This fire is very dangerous and spreading rapidly, but we’ll continue to attack it with all we’ve got,” Brown said Tuesday in a statement. “It’s critical residents stay ready and evacuate immediately if told to do so.”Fire officials have described the blaze as “out of control” and warned that conditions could worsen throughout the week.No fatalities have been reported, but one firefighter was injured in the Ventura County fire as nearly 1,000 people fought to control the blaze.In the San Fernando Valley north of Los Angeles, the so-called Creek Fire, which has charred more than 11,300 acres and forced 2,500 homes to evacuate, three firefighters were injured and taken to a hospital for treatment. The Los Angeles Fire Department said they are in stable condition.The so-called Rye Fire, located in Castaic and just north of the Six Flags Magic Mountain theme park, has taken over 7,000 acres. Local fire officials described as 5 percent contained on Wednesday morning. Another blaze in San Bernardino, called the Little Mountain Fire, has consumed 100 acres. It was last reported as having no containment, according to the San Bernardino Sun. President Donald Trump on Wednesday tweeted out his support for the first responders and those who are in the wildfires’ path.Among the homes reportedly under threat by the fires is Rupert Murdoch’s 13-acre Moraga Estate, which he purchased in 2013 for $30 million, according to LA Curbed. The estate’s mansion and private vineyards are located near the 405 freeway, where the Skirball Fire broke out early Wednesday, NBC Los Angeles reported. The vineyard did not immediately return a request for comment.Comedian Chelsea Handler tweeted Wednesday morning that she has evacuated her home. Musician Lionel Richie has also canceled a Wednesday night performance in Las Vegas due to the fires and his need to help “family evacuate to a safer place,” he announced on Twitter.At least 150 buildings have been damaged by the Ventura County fire, including an apartment complex and a psychiatric hospital, the Los Angeles Times reported. More than 250,000 homes were also without power, and all schools in the Ventura Unified School District were closed.“The burn area is pretty much all the mountains between Ventura and Ojai and extending east to Santa Paula,” Ventura County Sheriff’s Sgt. Kevin Donoghue told the Times. “It’s a challenge because of the enormity of it, and it’s a challenge because it’s pretty rugged terrain.”A spate of horrific wildfires tore through Northern California in October and killed more than 40 people. Nearly 9,000 homes and other buildings were destroyed in what became the most destructive and deadly blazes in state history.This story has been updated with new information on the fires’ development."

The National Weather Service said the Los Angeles region was under an extreme fire danger warning through Friday and said it expected the winds to continue throughout the week in the “strongest and longest Santa Ana event so far this season.”Just after 5 a.m. local time on Wednesday, a new brush fire dubbed the Skirball Fire took over 50 acres in Bel-Air. Video of it spreading uphill along the 405 freeway shows the surrounding hills glowing from the flames that have since forced the highway to shut down, the Los Angeles Times reported.Within roughly four hours, the fire had grown to 150 acres with 0 percent contained, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department.The nearby J. Paul Getty Museum, which houses European artwork and has closed amid the fires, announced on Twitter that its air filtration systems are working to protect its galleries from the surrounding smoke.California Gov. Jerry Brown has declared a state of emergency,“This fire is very dangerous and spreading rapidly, but we’ll continue to attack it with all we’ve got,” Brown said Tuesday in a statement. “It’s critical residents stay ready and evacuate immediately if told to do so.”Fire officials have described the blaze as “out of control” and warned that conditions could worsen throughout the week.No fatalities have been reported, but one firefighter was injured in the Ventura County fire as nearly 1,000 people fought to control the blaze.In the San Fernando Valley north of Los Angeles, the so-called Creek Fire, which has charred more than 11,300 acres and forced 2,500 homes to evacuate, three firefighters were injured and taken to a hospital for treatment. The Los Angeles Fire Department said they are in stable condition.The so-called Rye Fire, located in Castaic and just north of the Six Flags Magic Mountain theme park, has taken over 7,000 acres. Local fire officials described as 5 percent contained on Wednesday morning. Another blaze in San Bernardino, called the Little Mountain Fire, has consumed 100 acres. It was last reported as having no containment, according to the San Bernardino Sun.

36,POLITICS,Leaked PowerPoint Reveals The Gas Industry’s Playbook For Waging Pipeline Fights,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/your-energy-pipelines_us_5a25a649e4b03c44072fa1d0,"Your Energy, an industry front group, claims to have recruited 10,000 people to its cause of battling pipeline protesters.",2017-12-05,"A screenshot of results from searching the phrase ""Your Energy America"" on Facebook.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a25aae71900008f1e034708.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One of the natural gas industry’s top trade associations launched a front group earlier this year to defend new East Coast pipeline proposals against the kind of protests that have targeted oil projects like Keystone XL and Dakota Access. The American Gas Association-funded group Your Energy now claims it has recruited roughly 10,000 supporters to advocate for its companies and counter protesters who warn that new pipelines threaten to exacerbate climate change, cause environmental damage and violate landowners’ property rights. The registration number signals the organization’s ramped-up effort to shore up political support for new pipeline projects and tip the scales in favor of corporations that already wield disproportionate clout.Your Energy ― made up of a national organization and state chapters in Virginia and Connecticut ― provides research and colorful graphics, runs social media campaigns and gives companies access to a “digital war room” that tracks pipeline protests, according to an industry presentation from August. HuffPost obtained the PowerPoint after it briefly became accessible on the American Gas Association’s website.“There is strong and growing support for the valuable role that natural gas plays in our national energy future and the benefits this fuel brings to our environment and economy,” Jake Rubin, an American Gas Association spokesman, said in a statement. In August, the group claimed 5,436 registrants, including 3,001 in Virginia and 1,054 in Connecticut. Four months later, that total has nearly doubled. The group has broadened its footprint on social media, increasing the number of likes on its main Facebook page from 40,183 to 93,574. Searching for “Your Energy America” on Facebook lists the page as the top hit, just below Greenpeace USA.That in itself marks a small victory for the gas lobby. Your Energy builds on a longstanding effort by the fossil fuel industry to paint itself as a mere ideological rival to environmental groups at the opposite end of a political horseshoe.That narrative attempts to reframe the argument against pipelines around jobs and economic development rather than environmental concerns, ignoring the power disparity between deep-pocketed corporate giants and environmental nonprofits. During Virginia’s gubernatorial election this year, Dominion Energy ― the state’s biggest utility and major political donor ― poured resources into Your Energy Virginia and similar groups like EnergySure to whip up what it called a grassroots “campaign to elect a pipeline,” according to The Washington Post.At issue was the proposed Atlantic Coast Pipeline, which would carry gas 600 miles from West Virginia, through Virginia, to North Carolina. Both Gov.-elect Ralph Northam and his Republican opponent supported the project, which Dominion owns as part of a consortium. Since the election last month, anti-pipeline groups have railed against Northam for failing to disclose that several members of his transition team have ties to Dominion, and vowed to ramp up their opposition efforts. Though owned by other companies, the Mountain Valley Pipeline, a proposed 303-mile gas conduit that would go from West Virginia to southern Virginia, faces similar opposition. Bruce McKay, Dominion’s senior energy policy director, defended the company’s support of the Your Energy initiative, which he said was part of a “comms program” devised by the American Gas Association in response to the need to “step up and engage in ways that we hadn’t before.” “The AGA looked at the landscape and saw this public argument taking place about fossil energy and benefits of the natural gas and whether it should be expanded to other parts of the country,” McKay said, using the acronym for the American Gas Association. “It is going out and finding people who are interested in learning more about natural gas.” Intensifying public opposition to oil pipelines on a national level has heightened concerns for the gas industry. In February, President Donald Trump greenlighted the last permits to complete construction on the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline, which tunneled Bakken field crude oil under a sacred drinking water source in the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. Trump also revived TransCanada’s bid to build the Keystone XL pipeline to pump tar sands oil ― considered one of the dirtiest fossil fuels ― form Canada through Nebraska, a project that, according to one estimate, would add climate-changing emissions equivalent to putting roughly 5.6 million new cars on the road. Your Energy overlaps with some of that fight. Enbridge Energy Partners, a pipeline giant working to build multiple tar sands pipelines from Canada into the United States, listed Your Energy as a key public relations campaign in an industry presentation dated Oct. 9. The PowerPoint, signed by Peter Sheffield, an executive and registered lobbyist for Enbridge, also appeared on the American Gas Association’s website. The company, which hopes to complete a gas transmission line from Ontario to Ohio next year, included slides with quotations from Winston Churchill, Abraham Lincoln and Dwight D. Eisenhower about challenging lies, winning over public sentiment and carefully planning before challenging opponents. The gas industry depicts itself as a much cleaner alternative to dirtier fuels like coal and oil. Dave McCurdy, the president and chief executive of the American Gas Association, is a former Democratic congressman from Oklahoma. In June, he told HuffPost that, “We’re the mainstream guys,” as opposed to “extreme kinds of candidates” on both sides. Natural gas ― the majority of which is captured through the technique known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking ― produces far less carbon dioxide than oil or coal, the source of smog and the main cause of climate change. The U.S. vowed to reduce its CO2 emissions as part of the Paris climate agreement in 2015, and the gas industry and its allies take credit for shrinking the country’s carbon footprint as gas surpassed coal as utilities’ main fuel for electricity.But natural gas is mostly composed of methane, which traps 30 times more heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide. Methane emissions are on the rise, in part because of the fracking boom. The U.S. could be responsible for up to 60 percent of the worldwide surge in human-caused methane emissions since 2002, according to a Harvard University study released last year. The researchers said there was too little data to identify specific sources, but the increase tracked the boom in shale oil and gas production across the country, which leaks large amounts of methane from drilling sites and pipelines.Among conservatives, climate concerns about new pipelines often take a backseat to worries about how they might violate land rights. Last month, the consortium behind the Atlantic Coast Pipeline began preparing to sue the 20 percent of 2,900 property owners who refused to sign voluntary agreements to allow construction on their land.The American Gas Association said it does not target its member companies’ workers as part of the campaign, and that more than half of its registrants were “non-utility employees.” Rubin did not provide a breakdown of how many registrants worked in the industry that funds Your Energy. But Your Energy has been largely absent from pipeline fights on the ground so far, and has yet to boast any major accomplishments, such as hosting events or hitting targets for the number of phone calls to legislators. “For them, it’s like, ‘We have to do something, we have to counter this narrative, or at least we have to muddy the waters and make it seem like there’s protests on both sides,’” said Josh Stanfield, executive director of the progressive group Activate Virginia, which has opposed pipelines. “You have to be suspicious because there’s a clear motive on why they would set up a bullshit front organization for PR purposes.”“Do they serve any purpose other than simply being a form of crisis communications, like a PR response?” he added. “They definitely serve a purpose simply by existing so the industry can say there’s grassroots energy on our side, too, so they can make that argument and point to something as existing.” "

But last week, it was an adult who had a tantrum.Pastor David Grisham, a self-described Christian evangelist, taunted children and their parents who were waiting for a meeting with Kris Kringle at the Santa Claus House in North Pole, Alaska.“I wanted to tell you kids today too that Santa Claus does not exist. Santa Claus is not real,” Grisham announced. “The man you’re going to meet today is a man wearing a suit like a costume and it’s make-believe. It’s not real.” Although the parents largely tried to ignore Grisham, some very confused-looking children could be seen watching him on this clip:“Your parents have been telling you a story that is not true,” he said. “There are no reindeer, flying reindeer.”An employee interrupted Grisham spiel and asked him not to interfere with the customers. “I’m not interfering,” Grisham said. “I’m just telling them the truth.” He then promised to be done “in about a minute.” At that point, a parent got involved. “She said leave,” the parent said. “So go.” Grisham continued his rant as he departed, telling parents to stop lying to their children.The stunt earned Grisham hundreds of angry comments on his Facebook page. Similar remarks and reviews were posted on the Facebook page for his Repent Alaska group. The Southern Poverty Law Center listed Grisham’s Repent Amarillo organization as a hate group. He pulled a similar stunt in the Texas city last year at the Westgate Mall, where he filmed himself screaming at kids and their parents in front of Santa. A few years before that, he held a mock execution of Santa.Grisham now lists Anchorage as his place of residence. But wherever he resides, he will no doubt find coal in his stocking come Christmas morning. (h/t Raw Story)"

The Nike Pro Hijab went on sale globally this past weekend with the tag line “sports is for everyone.” The ad campaign features American Olympic fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad, Emirati figure skater Zahra Lari and German boxer Zeina Nassar. Nike revealed the hijab last winter when it was rolled out in stores in the Middle East. Now, athletes can purchase the Nike Pro Hijab around the world. “It really sunk in how much my previous hijab was hindering my performance when I tried the Nike Pro Hijab,” Muhammad told Nike in a recent press release. “Suddenly, I could hear, I wasn’t as hot and it felt like my body was able to cool itself down better and faster.”Nike designers worked on the hijab prototype for months asking different athletes including Lari, Nassar, weightlifter Amna Al Haddad and runner Manal Rostom to test out the hijab while competing. The hijab is available in sizes extra-small/small and medium/large. The garment is now available in select stores. It will be sold online by Nike in black and obsidian starting Thursday, but will be available in more colors come January.“It’s a reminder to us Muslim women that we can achieve anything in the world,” Lari told Nike of the company’s hijab. “What Nike has done for Muslim athletes is a dream that we never thought would happen.”While Nike is not the first company to create hijabs for athletes, it is the first large-scale global corporation to prioritize the needs of Muslim athletes. Muhammad, who recently launched her very own hijab-wearing Barbie, told Nike she hopes this step can make sports more inclusive to people of all backgrounds.“The Nike Pro Hijab will help advance the conversation around hijabs and Muslim women in sports and further make sports an inclusive space,” she said.Scroll below to see more photos of the Nike Pro Hijab.

I don’t view my behavior as superior to anyone, or anything (other than those who’ve been actively complicit in the recent American horror show), and I’m aware there are those who have devoted tremendous amounts of their time and efforts in righting our reeling ship of state.That said, I don’t think enough people are seeing things clearly enough ― still. And the groups that will need to coalesce in order to stave off further disasters have not, thus far, to my eye, made much of a move to do so.I am consistently disheartened to see so many people celebrating to such an extent each incremental progression of the Mueller investigation, and proclaiming that a meaningful reckoning will occur upon the 2018 mid-term elections. That doesn’t mean I think these things are insignificant, or that people shouldn’t take some solace where they can. But frequent banners stating that it’s “Mueller time,” or proclamations that the Trump family will die in jail (I’d bet everything but my life against this), or that we just need to “hold on” until 2018, make me fear that people are still, in spite of nothing other than mounting evidence, failing to recognize the true anti-constitutional, authoritarian, totalitarian intent of those currently running our government.Let me state it as clearly as I can: You haven’t seen anything yet. No matter how bad you think it has been, you have only been exposed to the initial, most timid, most limited, test-runs for everything yet to come. And, if common human nature proves consistent, each mounting victory by those without any moral constraint will lead to greater and greater deviations from anything those with functioning moral compasses consider to be norms. There are no grown-ups in the room. There never were. This has now been demonstrated (for, I would say, the N-th time).And there is no one riding in to save the day. The results of Mr. Mueller’s work remain completely unknown. Even the scope and the aims remain matters of speculation. And, even if the most serious indictments imaginable are brought, convictions are an entirely different matter, dependent upon forces, including judges and juries, which are completely unpredictable – or worse. Even if the most astonishing, unprecedented level of “justice” were to be imposed, this would not occur for years.As for elections, those who have just voted in favor of a bill reconfiguring massive portions of our economy without anything approaching adequate analysis or commentary (and inserting guidelines for everything up to and including when life begins), despite 75 percent public opposition, appear to care little about electoral consequences, or any consequences at all. I’m among those that do not consider this to be incidental, or unconsidered. They either suddenly don’t care about reelection and maintaining majority power (which I find unlikely), or they believe combinations of gerrymandering, voting restrictions/vote suppression, ideologically immovable conservative judges, and unwavering support by a conservative base immune to insult, will render them impervious to opposition. And I believe they have reason to feel safe in their assumptions (read a little Sarah Kendzior, active on Twitter, for some perspective on this; on second thought, read a lot).So, what’s to be done? If the judicial branch of government and elections can’t save us from representatives who not only ignore their constituents’ interests, but aggressively grind them into compost to be lovingly laid upon corporations’ gardens of greed, what recourse do we have?I think what’s been required for sometime (since precisely March 16, 2016, when Merrick Garland was nominated by Barack Obama to sit upon the Supreme Court Bench, through April 7, 2017, when Neil Gorsuch was instead confirmed for the seat; the lack of adequately aggressive public opposition to these acts is what demonstrated the public’s willingness to accept the unacceptable) is a uniting of forces opposed to the anti-citizenry takeover of the federal government, and an all-out campaign by that coalition to refuse to allow the degradation in process to continue.To my mind, the few progressive groups in recent years that have demonstrated a willingness to actually put their safety and freedom on the line in significant numbers have been Occupy Wall Street, those defending lands against the Dakota Access Pipeline, and Black Lives Matter. This isn’t to diminish the importance and the impact of the organizers and participants in recent “Women’s” marches, or the actions and campaigns of any number of progressive, service-oriented, and opposition groups. I only mean to state my personal belief that signing petitions, and distributing memes, and making donations, and registering voters, and canvassing neighborhoods, and calling congressional offices, or even attending long-scheduled, permitted marches (which, I will sheepishly admit, have constituted most of my own “activism”) are not close to what is called for at this moment in history. “Woefully inadequate,” I’m sorry to say, is the phrase that comes to my mind. It’s just common sense. When the controlling party makes clear their utter disinterest in even overwhelming public opinion polls, what good is a petition? What use is a one-day demonstration? Meanwhile, most Americans of effective protest age haven’t got an instant’s experience with more vociferous, sustained, and adequately disruptive campaigns of resistance to anything.What I wish would occur, in my own fantasy land of imaginings, would be for the Occupy/Bernie Sanders/Jill Stein sects, to unite with the Black Lives Matter members and supporters, along with Native American and environmental land protectionists, and all join forces with the (let’s call them) more centrist, “traditionally” progressive Democratic party forces, realizing that each of their essential, individual goals – some as urgent as repeated, retribution-free murders at the hands of police – are all dependent upon at least a façade of functioning democracy. Which has, in recent months, been deteriorating further and further from its already troubled, pre-November 2016, state.This, by itself, would require almost unimaginable selflessness by the groups and people I’ve described. Many of them continue to believe they were no better off prior to November 8, 2016, and wouldn’t be any better off if the election results that day had been different (though, personally, I disagree with that assessment; but it’s hardly mine to make on their behalf). How on Earth could they therefor be expected to join forces with those they consider equally grievous to our current cabal of caretakers? The only answer I can give is, how can you not? Wouldn’t it make sense to join forces, at least temporarily, until some semblance of order has been restored (along with, oh, say, the Voting Rights Act), and split up in rancor then?If such a coalition could be created, and maintained, the work at hand would still include all the efforts I mentioned earlier (phone calls, petitions, canvassing, etc.), along with urgent, immediate, massive, sustained campaigns of civil disobedience and disruption adequate to overwhelm those currently in power, who have proven impervious to more “normal” political pressures.Because time is running out. This so called “tax bill,” coupled with removal of net neutrality restrictions, coupled with aims of curtailing honest, in-depth reporting, coupled with an impenetrable “voting irregularities” commission, coupled with an unprecedentedly immoral and authoritarian executive, add up to only one logical end game – and it doesn’t include a sharing of wealth, or powers, with anyone.The most recent campaign I can point to, as an example of the kind of resistance I’m trying to describe, is that of Act Up, the AIDS advocacy and action group that succeeded in forcing the FDA to change its stance on releasing drugs more quickly for those in dire need. Doomed and imperiled men, along with their very sparse allies, staged theatrical demonstrations, disrupted civil functions, occupied government agencies, and – lo and behold – achieved their aims (Act Up’s occupation of the FDA occurred in 1988, so I’m reaching back quite a bit; their website today boasts, “30th Anniversary. We’re not celebrating.”).Some of this appears to have begun. I see that some hundreds of people have been protesting in the hallways of Congress, attempting to disrupt the work of their representatives. I’m advocating for this to swell into the thousands. At least. On an extended basis.What seems to be missing from the hearts and minds of massive number of Americans today is the acknowledgement of their own dire circumstances. There seems to be a lack of understanding that the current slate of Republican party representatives, who have embraced Donald Trump and his administration as their ticket to ride roughshod over the American public, mean them no good, and – in fact – are quite indifferent to their pain, suffering, and even their demise. Because, make no mistake about it, pain, and suffering, and massive numbers of premature deaths are on their way (as they have already occurred, and remain underreported, in Puerto Rico). I, for one, am a cancer survivor, who is in touch with other cancer patients and survivors. I know the workings and language of the EPA, as it was imperfectly implemented, and operated. The effective elimination of this agency alone, which has already occurred, will cost thousands of people their lives each year.It’s really a question as to whether or not today’s U. S. citizenry has got it in them to insist upon accurate, and legal, representation. When the inaccuracy is severe enough to endanger actual existence, and the people still won’t do more than state their outrage in response, it doesn’t bode well for a democracy, or a nation, or even, I’m sorry to say, for a species. The time for well-spoken opposition (like this screed, if it even qualifies as such) passed some time ago. It’s time to put up a much more literal fight. It’s time to take to the streets, and to congressional offices, and to the halls of power everywhere, in massive numbers, and to stay there. Because – and here comes about the only optimistic thing I’ve got to say – if enough Americans demand something, there is no way they can, or will, be denied. Everything is possible, if the tactics are appropriate, and effectively implemented. But, signing petitions, and calling offices, are, I’m sorry to say, the equivalents of dipping one’s toes in cold water.So, who’s ready to stop imploring, and start insisting? Who’s ready to take to the streets, and stand in the rain, and spend time in jail, and take turns replacing each other, 24/7, until sanity is restored? I’ve got no experience with organizing it, myself. Are there those out there who do, who are prepared to begin? Consider me signed up to attend.I’m sorry, but I don’t see any reversals happening any other way."

The lifestyle expert and homemaking entrepreneur was an early advocate for same-sex marriage well before it became the law of the land in the U.S. in 2015. Her magazine, Martha Stewart Weddings, was one of the first in mainstream U.S. media to highlight a same-sex couple’s nuptials (Jeremy Hooper and Andrew Shulman) in 2009, and continues to feature LGBTQ couples prominently. As the Supreme Court prepares to decide whether business owners have the right to cite their religious views in denying service to same-sex couples, Stewart is reiterating her support of marriage equality.“I don’t differentiate a gay wedding from a straight wedding,” Stewart, 76, told PrideSource in a Monday interview. “I just don’t differentiate ... I think it’s absolutely a fact that all men are created equal, and so I just treated people like equals my entire life. Equals in every single way, no matter what their proclivity is or what their sexuality is, or their color or their race.”She added, “You know, every wedding is special to me.”“I even introduce him playfully to friends as my gay son,” she told PrideSource’s Chris Azzopardi. As to how Sharkey achieved such a familial moniker, she quipped, “He’s worked for [me for] 18 years, that’s how! He worked his way up!”Read the full interview with Stewart over at PrideSource. "

But in an email obtained by the Times that McFarland sent on Dec. 29, 2016 ― the day the Obama administration had authorized new sanctions against Russia ― she said that Flynn would talk to the Russian ambassador that evening. The email from McFarland ― who was on Trump’s transition team, then served as deputy national security adviser until May and is currently awaiting confirmation as ambassador to Singapore ― adds another layer to special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government to influence the 2016 election. Flynn pleaded guilty on Friday to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Kislyak. Flynn struck a plea deal, indicating that he might be cooperating with Mueller in the investigation. McFarland’s name has already come up in news on the Russia investigation. On Friday, multiple outlets reported that McFarland was the “senior official” mentioned in a crucial passage of the court documents filed by special counsel Robert Mueller.According to the documents, Flynn made a call on Dec. 29 to a “senior official” on the transition team and “discussed the U.S. sanctions, including the potential impact of those sanctions on the incoming administration’s foreign policy goals.” Flynn then called Kislyak.McFarland is not the first Trump administration official to misspeak about the Trump campaign’s contacts with Russian officials. Attorney General Jeff Sessions was forced to recuse himself from the Russia investigation after admitting that he had had meetings with Kislyak, contradicting his previous Senate testimony."

Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, speaks to reporters Monday on Capitol Hill. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a2601631900008f1e034810.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― In a strange gambit that left many aides and House members scratching their heads, the Freedom Caucus nearly took down a motion to go to conference on the GOP tax bill Monday night in order to change the expiration date of an upcoming government continuing resolution.Stranger yet: The strategy seemed to work.About a dozen House Freedom Caucus members initially voted against a motion for the House and Senate to negotiate on their differing tax bills, blocking the motion from adoption. But after a tense conversation on the floor between leaders of the conservative caucus and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and chief deputy whip Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) ― as well as an off-the-floor phone conversation between HFC Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) ― the conservatives flipped their votes to allow the tax bill to go to conference.After the vote, Meadows wouldn’t say he got “an ironclad commitment” to change the expiration date of the continuing resolution, which is needed this week to prevent a government shutdown, but he heavily suggested that conservatives had forced GOP leadership to move the date from Dec. 22 to at least Dec. 30, and potentially even later. “I felt very good about the dialogue I had with the speaker,” Meadows said.Meadows added that he thought there was a better chance the resolution would go to the 30th, but there isn’t a clear sense of why conservatives feel so strongly that going a few days past Christmas is so much more preferable to a resolution that expires a few days before Christmas.“This doesn’t seem to accomplish anything material,” one senior GOP aide told HuffPost after the vote Monday night, “unless their goal is to screw up people’s Christmas plans — and that’s just mean.”Freedom Caucus members seemed to think there would be more pressure for members to accept a raw deal on the 22nd than there would be on the 30th. “There is a whole lot more pressure to get home for Christmas than there is for New Year’s,” Meadows told reporters Monday night.But no one among GOP or Democratic leadership could explain how this changes the dynamics of a year-end spending deal. Democrats still have the leverage by virtue of Republicans controlling government. (Voters tend to blame the party in power for a government shutdown, and Republicans need Democratic votes if they’re going to pass any of these spending deals.)Worse yet for Republicans, GOP defense hawks want a significant plus-up beyond spending caps set in 2011. To get an agreement on those defense numbers, Democrats are expected to demand concessions on non-defense spending, an immigration program, a reauthorization of the Childrean’s Health Insurance Program and subsidies for Obamacare.Pushing back the expiration date of one continuing resolution ― leaders expect to have to pass another CR as well before lawmakers pass a massive omnibus spending package early next year ― doesn’t really change the dynamics of the situation, unless conservatives are just trying to separate the continuing resolution and the final version of the tax bill. But even then, Republican and Democratic leaders could pass a continuing resolution until Dec. 30, pass another one a week early that would last longer, without conservatives’ help, and be in exactly the same situation.The truth is, no one really knows how this will play out. There’s a general sense Democrats end up winning overall. But how and when ― that remains to be seen.Congress needs to pass a bill to continue government operations by the end of the week. Republican leaders wanted that bill to go until Dec. 22, so they could use the next two weeks to work out an agreement with Democrats on overall spending numbers. If that gets done, then Congress would pass yet another CR to buy time for an even larger spending bill that would fund the government through September. And because Republicans will need to get some Democrats on board to support these bills in the Senate, the conservative caucus’s votes probably aren’t that vital.That last insight was one of the reasons Freedom Caucus members held the motion to go to conference on the tax bill hostage. They may not have any sizable leverage over these spending bills, but they have plenty of sway over the tax legislation.When HuffPost asked Freedom Caucus member Scott DesJarlais (R-Tenn.) if conservatives were afraid they had no leverage over the spending bills because at least some Democrats would be supplying the votes for these measures, not exclusively Republicans, DesJarlais said that was “exactly” the issue.“Bundling” the continuing resolution with the tax bill negotiations “creates a potential problem as well,” DesJarlais said.Again, House Freedom Caucus members are concerned some Senate Republicans may ask for certain concessions on the continuing resolution in exchange for their votes on the tax bill conference report. But GOP leaders still have that trick at their disposal with a longer-term continuing resolution.All that this strategy seems to do ― other than potentially ruin reporter travel plans ― is put Republican leaders on notice that the House Freedom Caucus is watching."

It is muttabal shamandar, a velvety dip fragrant with beets, tahini, and olive oil; it is baba ghannouj, a chunky riot of eggplant and bell pepper; it is kebab hindi, tender meatballs swaddled in spicy tomato sauce.To Vancouverites, Syrian food is in part a way to support recently arrived refugees. And to the Syrian women who prepare the food, it is a way to find their footing in a new home.One year ago, Nihal Elwan founded Tayybeh: A Celebration of Syrian Cuisine. With a $500 CAD grant from a local foundation, the Cairo-born international development consultant organized what was to be a one-off dinner to connect Syrians and Canadians.

So far, they’ve cooked in a Palestinian restaurant, church halls, and a grade school cafeteria.In September, I was one of 160 people at the largest Tayybeh dinner to date, held at the Vancouver Japanese Language School. “[The location] really resonated with us, given the Japanese community were newcomers and that they went through their fair share of adversity,” says Nihal, referring to a period in the 1940s when the government seized Japanese-Canadians’ property and sent them to internment camps.Under the roof of one community’s resilience, we dug in to help another establish itself. I couldn’t stop spooning up mloukheye bil jaij, Middle Eastern greens with chicken. The first bite yielded a silky green reminiscent of tea—slightly tannic, with the texture of chard—that gave way to the richness of a Sunday roast chicken, then a punch of tomato and lemon. That night I dreamed of pomegranates, chicken stew, and nearly fluorescent beet dip.When I meet Maha Almaarabani a few weeks later, her magenta headscarf and hot-pink Tayybeh apron echo the color of that dip. Originally from Damascus, she came to Vancouver in October 2016, and coincidentally, mloukheye is her favorite dish to prepare.“The stew with greens and chicken?” I ask. My excitement needs no translation. With Nihal acting as interpreter, Maha explains that each Syrian city has a different way of preparing the dish.A few feet away, Raghda Hassan pauses from stuffing rounds of dough with a cheese-olive mixture to wink at me.“You tried the recipe from Latakia [where Raghda is from],” says Nihal. As Raghda and Maha debate, she translates. In Latakia, the greens are boiled in water first, while in Damascus they’re pan-fried in ghee for a crunchier texture. In Vancouver, the ladies buy the greens dried, and can only find them in a few Arab stores—a far cry from back home, where Maha got fresh leaves and dried them herself.Canadian cheese is challenging, too. Nihal says they’ve tried many different kinds, “but they keep saying, ‘it’s not right, it’s not right!’” Meat comes frozen from the halal butcher. When I ask about it, Maha makes a face. “She says everything tastes different here. The meat is almost dry,” translates Nihal.Still, the ladies power through as best they can. The notion of a recipe, in the Western sense, seems foreign to them; Maha says she has a “breath” for cooking that doesn’t rely on instructions. Another Tayybeh chef, Hasna Shekh Omar, blends dishes and techniques from Idlib, Aleppo, and regions across the Turkish border.For the ladies, the Tayybeh project is a natural extension of what they’ve done their whole lives: cook and welcome people to the table. It is especially fitting for Hasna, whose seven children are now spread among Canada, Turkey, and Syria. “You see how all these people come to our dinners and they love our food? This is the same that we had [in Syria],” she says through Nihal.But it’s also something new. Raghda and Maha and Hasna have never worked outside their homes, never mind in a professional kitchen. For them, the company is a gateway, not just to a better income than they’d receive in other restaurant work, but to developing the skills they need in Vancouver: learning English, navigating public transit, and building up a resume.So what does Syrian food taste like? It tastes like dried greens from the Arabic store, soaked in water like they do in Latakia, melded with stock from too-lean Canadian chicken, and stewed until silky. To Vancouverites, it tastes like a pop-up dinner in a community hall. To the ladies of Tayybeh, it doesn’t quite taste like home. But it tastes like home for now.This article originally appeared on SAVEUR."

It is muttabal shamandar, a velvety dip fragrant with beets, tahini, and olive oil; it is baba ghannouj, a chunky riot of eggplant and bell pepper; it is kebab hindi, tender meatballs swaddled in spicy tomato sauce.To Vancouverites, Syrian food is in part a way to support recently arrived refugees. And to the Syrian women who prepare the food, it is a way to find their footing in a new home.One year ago, Nihal Elwan founded Tayybeh: A Celebration of Syrian Cuisine. With a $500 CAD grant from a local foundation, the Cairo-born international development consultant organized what was to be a one-off dinner to connect Syrians and Canadians.

51,POLITICS,The Gender Divide On Men And Women's Roles Is Dwarfed By The Gap Between Democrats And Republicans,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-republicans-men-and-women_us_5a26e9d7e4b069df71fa3e71,"Republicans are from Mars, Democrats are from Venus?",2017-12-05,Democrats more than twice as likely as Republicans to say more work is needed to bring about gender equality,http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/16163741/PSDT_10.18.17_gender-00-00.png,"Men and women have different views about gender. But the differences between what men and women say often pale in comparison to the splits along partisan lines, according to a study released Tuesday by Pew Research.Women, for instance, are 15 points likelier than men to say that the country hasn’t gone far enough when it comes to gender equality. By contrast, Democrats are 43 points likelier than Republicans to say the nation has more work to do. That makes the gap separating Democrats and Republicans nearly three times the size of the gap separating men and women.Similarly, women are 13 points likelier than men to say men have it easier, while Democrats are 30 points likelier than Republicans to hold that view.And while there’s only an 8-point divide between women and men in thinking that there’s too little societal emphasis on encouraging girls to be leaders, there’s a 25-point partisan divide on the same question. There’s also a notable partisan divide on the question of whether society is accepting enough of women who take on gender roles usually associated with men, and vice versa.It’s not just gender that’s taken a back seat to partisanship. For Americans, political party now eclipses other demographic factors like race, religion and age as a predictor of their political views. In a HuffPost/YouGov poll taken before last year’s election, Americans were more likely to feel they shared common interests with their fellow partisans than with people of the same gender, ethnic background, income level, religion, age group or region.But within both parties, there are notable differences between men and women on issues like the recent wave of sexual harassment cases brought to light. In another recent HuffPost/YouGov poll, female Democrats ― but not male Democrats ― wanted Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) to resign over groping allegations. Similarly, female Republicans, but not male Republicans, wanted Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore to drop out over the accusations that he preyed on multiple underage girls while in his 30s. Male Democrats were likelier than female Democrats to say that their party handled sexual harassment accusations well, while male Republicans were likelier than female Republicans to say that harassment wasn’t a serious issue within the party.Pew surveyed 4,573 adults between Aug. 8-21 and Sept. 14-28, using an online panel."

Jay Inslee will be chairman of the Democratic Governors Association.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a26068c150000459385b7a8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D) was elected Monday to become chair of the Democratic Governors Association, charged with leading their efforts to take back dozens of top state posts across the country, a crucial step in rebuilding their party in 2018 and beyond.Unlike the Senate, where they will be almost entirely on defense in next year’s congressional midterms, Democrats have an opportunity to pick up seats in 26 gubernatorial elections, including in 13 states whose Republican governors are currently term-limited.The stakes for Democrats are high. Republicans control 32 state legislatures across the country, and winning more governorships would give Democratic officials a crucial stake in the decennial redistricting battles that will take place after the 2020 census. The process could allow party officials to draw more evenly shaped congressional districts in order to compete for additional House seats.For now, though, the prospect of adding to the ranks of Democratic governors would bolster the growing “resistance” movement focused on fighting President Donald Trump and his policy agenda. West Coast governors like Inslee have worked to block early iterations of Trump’s travel ban, for example, which was aimed at refugees and immigrants from Muslim countries.Inslee, who is serving his second term as Washington’s governor and his first as the chair of the DGA, predicted Republicans would come to regret their association with an exceedingly unpopular president. He said he was positive that, short of the U.S. ending up in a “shooting war” with a foreign power in the next 11 months, Democrats would exceed expectations next year.“They cannot hide from him,” Inslee said of Trump in an interview on Monday. “He is an anchor they will tow around and cannot free themselves from.”Inslee said that Democrats are “highly confident” about winning governorships in New Mexico, Nevada and Maine, whose Republican governors are term-limited, and that they have a good chance of winning in places they usually don’t compete well in: red states including South Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Kansas.Last month, Democrats made big gains across the country by taking key state legislative seats, two governorships and full control of the state governments of New Jersey and Washington. Democrat Ralph Northam’s victory over Republican Ed Gillespie in Virginia’s gubernatorial race, in particular, gave party officials hope they would see a blue wave in next year’s midterm elections.Inslee said that Democrats will tailor their message to voters by focusing primarily on economic growth and jobs, like they did in Virginia. The Republican tax proposal that is advancing in Congress, which has similarly received poor marks from the public, will also be in the mix.“We’re going to hang this around their necks because its not trusted by American people. They know a scam when they see one,” Inslee said, arguing that the GOP tax plan would hurt rural voters by giving handouts to corporations to the detriment of the middle class.Republicans in Virginia and nationwide have gone on offense over so-called sanctuary cities: jurisdictions whose law enforcement agencies can refuse to cooperate with federal immigration officers. The issue received national attention last week when a jury acquitted an undocumented immigrant of murder in the 2015 death of a woman in San Francisco, which has designated itself as a sanctuary city. Trump blasted the verdict in Kate Steinle’s death as a “miscarriage of justice,” signaling that the issue of sanctuary cities is likely to become fodder in state races.Inslee said he wasn’t worried about the GOP messaging on the issue, however, pointing to the result in Virginia, where Gillespie employed a similar tactic.“It just didn’t work. He sank like a rock. It actually failed,” he said.Inslee said it was “extremely important” for Democrats to win governorships next year in order to be able to influence the congressional redistricting process after the 2020 census. He called the current system heavily tilted toward Republicans, adding that Democrats simply wanted to restore the balance to districts Republicans favorably drew for themselves after the 2010 census. “I don’t think Americans have to worry about it getting all of a sudden gerrymandered by the Democrats,” Inslee said, referring to the process of manipulating district boundaries. “Just having a fair shake is all we’re asking for.”Inslee’s leadership role at the DGA will put him in a position to travel the country and rub shoulders with Democratic officials and donors outside of Washington. The high-profile position has already prompted some chatter about him possibly running for president in 2020.Asked whether he had plans to do so, Inslee said he was focused on his two jobs at hand.“I’m totally engaged in being governor, and I’m excited about being [DGA] chair,” he said.With unified control of state government for the first time in his tenure as governor as a result of last month’s elections, Inslee will have plenty on his plate during his second term in office. He said he plans to move forward with a trio of progressive proposals: measures to charge carbon polluters, strengthen voting rights and expand abortion rights.“This is a place where Trump cannot stop us,” he said."

He was soon rehired with a promotion and currently works out of the company’s New York office. He was appointed the editor-in-chief of the National Enquirer and vice president of news in 2014, according to company press releases. This October, he was promoted to chief content officer of the AMI Celebrity Group.“Dylan has been a driving force behind much of the success that AMI has enjoyed in recent years in the celebrity group,” AMI CEO David J. Pecker said in a press release at the time.In a statement to HuffPost, a spokesperson for AMI called the accusations made against Howard “baseless” and said that the company stands by its investigation.American Media Inc. takes any claims of workplace harassment very seriously. After a thorough review by a third party investigator, American Media stands by the findings of that investigation. We welcomed Mr. Howard back to AMI in 2012, and since that time he has continued to have the respect of his peers and colleagues, and has been promoted to his current position as Chief Content Officer. In the wake of these baseless allegations, he has the full support of AMI and its executives.Cam Stracher, a lawyer for AMI, told the AP that the 2012 investigation found no evidence of serious wrongdoing.“It was determined that there was some what you would call as horsing around outside the office, going to bars and things that are not uncommon in the media business,” Stracher told the outlet, “but none of it rose to the level of harassment that would require termination.”The AP learned of the claims against the tabloid editor after speaking to 12 former AMI employees, most of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity, as well as the consultant the company hired to investigate Howard.At least one employee reportedly complained that Howard said he wanted to create a Facebook account about her vagina, a claim Stracher told the AP was false. Ex-employees told the AP that Howard forced female employees to watch or listen to recordings of celebrities having sex for no professional reason. They also claimed that Howard encouraged journalists to have sex with sources to get more information for their stories.Maxine “Max” Page, a former senior editor at RadarOnline ― an AMI publication ― said Howard’s behavior was “completely unacceptable” and that she reported him to human resources on behalf of two female reporters. Page’s report prompted the company to hire an outside consultant to investigate Howard’s behavior.Howard has also been accused of helping discredit women accusing film mogul Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault, including actress Rose McGowan, The New Yorker reported in November.Howard reportedly sent his own reporters to find information on McGowan. In one instance, according to The New Yorker, the reporter recorded an off-the-record conversation with one of McGowan’s exes and told Weinstein about the conversation. AMI also runs the prominent celebrity tabloids Star Magazine and OK! Magazine.Maxwell Strachan contributed to this report.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story indicated that Cam Stracher was Dylan Howard’s lawyer.

If elected, Norwood would be the city's first white mayor since 1973.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a26517e150000459385b7e9.jpeg?cache=JKPtzIce9C&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For the first time since 1969, Atlanta, Georgia, may elect a white mayor.City Councilwoman Keisha Lance Bottoms, a black Democrat, and City Councilwoman Mary Norwood, a white, centrist independent, are locked in a dead heat in the polls ahead of Tuesday’s runoff. A Friday poll showed Norwood with a 6-percentage-point lead over Bottoms. Other recent surveys showed Bottoms ahead by a small margin.A Norwood win would mark something of an earthquake in Georgia politics, handing the reins of a majority-black city to a white leader and depriving the Democratic Party of its biggest bastion of power in the Peach State.Her victory would reflect the growing size and influence of the white population in Atlanta as a result of gentrification, as well as dissatisfaction with decades of black political leaders’ pro-business policies in the city, according to Michael Leo Owens, a professor of political science at Emory University.“This would put so many black elected officials on notice that the neoliberal approach has its limits electorally, that there are people who are demanding more and that people are not satisfied,” Owens said.Even the declining share of black voters in the city is to some extent an indictment of center-left black political rule, Owens argued.“A lot of black folks have left the city. They are voting with their feet,” Owens said. “That is a reflection of some of the weaknesses and limits of black Democratic practices in the city of Atlanta.”Atlanta, the commercial capital of the Southeast, is a historic hub of black wealth and political power. The city has been run by black mayors since 1973, when Maynard Jackson defeated white incumbent Sam Massell. Jackson was the first black mayor of any major Southern city.In recent years though, as development has exploded in Atlanta, the city has become increasingly white, creating more fertile ground for a figure like Norwood to thrive.The percentage of Atlantans who are white rose from 33 percent in 2000 to 40 percent in 2015, according to Census data. Over the same period, the black percentage of the city’s population declined from 61 percent to 53 percent.Given the rising white population, it is less surprising that Norwood is so competitive, according to Owens.Norwood already came inches away from the mayoralty in 2009, when Mayor Kasim Reed defeated her by a margin of just over 600 votes.In this year’s nonpartisan primary on Nov. 7, Norwood came in second after Bottoms. But in that first round, Owens noted, Norwood also had to contend with two other white candidates ― former Atlanta Chief Operating Officer Peter Aman and former City Councilwoman Cathy Woolard ― who likely fractured the white vote.Norwood’s strong standing cannot be attributed solely to the growing influence of white voters in the city, however. The race has been shaken by what Owens calls the “defections” of prominent black leaders to Norwood’s candidacy. Former Atlanta Mayor Shirley Franklin, who preceded current Mayor Kasim Reed; outgoing City Council President Ceasar Mitchell, who came in sixth place in the Nov. 7 mayoral primary; and former Fulton County Commission Chair John Eaves, another failed mayoral contender, have all announced their support for Norwood.For his part, former state Sen. Vincent Fort, a champion of Atlanta’s working-class and low-income families with deep support in the city’s activism community, declined to endorse in the race. But in his remarks announcing the decision, Fort made a point of praising Norwood as someone with whom progressive activists could work, and said virtually nothing about Bottoms.The lack of unity behind Bottoms in Atlanta’s black establishment has as much, if not more, to do with city power brokers’ feelings about Mayor Reed ― Bottoms’ top backer ― as it does about either Bottoms or Norwood themselves.Reed “looms very, very large” in the race, Owens said.At the same time that the term-limited Reed is feverishly working to elect Bottoms as his successor, his administration is mired in a corruption scandal over bribery in the city contracting process. In September, Adam Smith, the city’s former chief procurement officer under Reed, pleaded guilty in federal court to accepting $30,000 in bribes in exchange for help winning city contracts.The high-profile guilty plea has stoked suspicion that the corruption went deeper in the Reed administration, casting a pall over city officials close to the mayor, including Bottoms. In October, fearing potential allegations of guilt by association, Bottoms returned over $25,000 in contributions from a city contractor targeted by the federal bribery probe.But perhaps most importantly, critics of Bottoms associate her with Reed’s neglect of underprivileged neighborhoods in Atlanta.Deborah Arnold, a 54-year-old affordable housing activist who lives in a mixed-income building complex in the Mechanicsville neighborhood, said she planned to vote for Norwood because of her disappointment in how Reed had handled the concerns of low-income communities about gentrification. Arnold worries about being able to continue living in her neighborhood as housing prices rise and the city facilitates the development of areas around the old Turner Field where the Atlanta Braves used to play.Bottoms “is a continuation of Mayor Reed, definitely,” Arnold said. “I voted for Mayor Reed twice but I am disappointed. I don’t want to see him a third time around through Keisha Lance Bottoms.”Atlanta’s steady economic development has filled city coffers, but it has coincided with the displacement of predominantly black, lower-earning Atlantans who can no longer afford to live in the city.Some of the numbers are staggering. In Fulton County, where all but a sliver of Atlanta is located, 22 percent of renters received eviction notices in 2015, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta ― twice the rate of Cleveland, Ohio.The rate of eviction notices, which the Fed calls a “crisis,” appears to be linked to the decline in affordable housing stock. Rental properties in Atlanta with rents of $750 a month or less have declined by 4.4 percent annually from 2006 to 2013, according to a 2015 analysis by Dan Immergluck, an urban planning expert then at Georgia Tech.Bottoms has proposed several policies to increase affordable housing, the biggest of which is raising $1 billion in public and private funding to “fight displacement” and fund the development of affordable housing.Norwood has a list of her own housing proposals that include promises to “protect senior homeowners,” reduce or freeze property taxes for vulnerable homeowners, and partner with the federal government to provide more affordable housing vouchers.For many black critics of Reed, Norwood’s relatively moderate profile, frequent appearances at civil society events in predominantly black neighborhoods, and reputation for openness to other ideas gives them permission to consider her candidacy, according to Owens.“She has left the door open for people to have reason to support her,” Owens said.Tim Franzen, one of Atlanta’s leading housing justice and civil rights activists, ran the field program for Vincent Fort’s mayoral campaign and now supports Norwood.Franzen said Bottoms has been non-responsive or outright hostile to the demands of coalitions he has led. Norwood, by contrast, has kept an open door to Franzen and groups he works with like the Housing Justice League, according to Franzen.“I’m not excited to vote for Mary Norwood, but I could not in good conscience vote for Keisha,” he said. For her part, Norwood has been dogged by questions about troubling comments she has made. In June remarks to the Buckhead Young Republicans, Norwood was recorded narrating a lengthy account of how she believes Reed organized voter fraud with the help of “thugs.”At a debate in late November, shortly after the Atlanta Journal-Constitution published a tape of Norwood’s comments to the Buckhead Young Republicans, Bottoms accused Norwood of using “coded language” to promote stereotypes of African-Americans committing voter fraud.“The coded language was related to African-Americans who exercised their lawful right to vote,” said Bottoms. “And my opponent referred to it in a secret tape using coded language.”The Bottoms campaign is making the case that Norwood does not have the experience or sensitivity to navigate the city through moments of racial tension that might arise in the future.“The fear for a lot of people is that we could have some Ferguson situation erupt and she is not the one to lead us through it,” a Bottoms campaign aide told HuffPost.Meanwhile, the Georgia Democratic Party has pulled out all of the stops to depict Norwood as a closet Republican and frame the mayoral contest as a key test in the fight against President Donald Trump. The party created a website, “MaryTheRepublican.com,” that touts Norwood’s hiring of some Republican consultants, her refusal to endorse Democrat Jon Ossoff in the special congressional election in June, and audio in which she implied that she chose to run as an independent rather than as a Republican because it is more politically expedient in Atlanta.The party even launched a six-figure ad campaign asking whether Atlanta’s next mayor should be “from the party of Trump.”Norwood has vehemently denied any association with Trump, describing herself as a “progressive independent.” A supporter of abortion and LGBTQ rights, Norwood says she voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and voted for Barack Obama twice before that.Bottoms has nonetheless benefitted from attempts to nationalize the race. Democratic Sens. Kamala Harris (Calif.) and Cory Booker (N.J.) both visited Atlanta to campaign for Bottoms, emphasizing the importance of keeping a Democrat in power in the city. Bottoms has also had the vocal support of local rap legends TI and “Killer Mike” Render. The latter supported Fort in the primary.“Atl this is a National Election don’t Be fooled! All of black America and Worker Class America will be affected,” Render wrote in the caption of a pro-Bottoms Instagram post providing information for voters who need rides to the polls. (Render has over 430,000 Instagram followers and he has increasingly saturated his feed with enthusiastic encomiums to vote for Bottoms.)Among some rank-and-file voters though, there is a sense that the race has forced them to pick between the better of two imperfect choices. Angelo Veney, a 51-year-old software engineer, owns a condominium in Atlanta’s West End neighborhood. Veney, who has been frustrated with what he believes is the Reed administration’s inattention to neighborhoods like his, voted for former City Councilwoman Woolard in the primary.Deciding who to vote for in the runoff, however, was the “toughest decision” of his life, Veney said. He ended up voting early for Bottoms, because he believes she would make a better spokeswoman for the city.If Norwood wins, Veney said, he is hopeful that her desire to earn the trust of black Atlantans could actually lead her to work harder on behalf of some of the city’s underserved neighborhoods.“She’s gonna have prove to the black community that she is about her word, about being all inclusive and representative of all the neighborhoods,” Veney predicted. “So I think she is going to put some energy and effort into it.”Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated former Mayor Shirley Franklin’s last name."

Authorities said they immediately devised a plan to protect the mosque and to have an undercover officer befriend Bolatete, a Jacksonville resident.“Due to many safeguards we had in place during this investigation, at no time were … any of the members of (the center) at risk,” FBI Special Agent in Charge Charles Spencer said Monday.Bolatete was arrested Friday after buying a silencer from the undercover officer. The suspect could face more charges, officials said.The complaint contains chilling excerpts of comments allegedly made by Bolatete during extensive recorded conversations and text messages. According to police, he told the undercover officer that his health was declining due to kidney problems and he wanted to “shoot up” a mosque before he died.“I just want to give these freaking people a taste of their own medicine … they are the ones who are always doing these shootings,” Bolatete wrote in a Nov. 14 text message, authorities said.According to the FBI, Bolatete said he planned to carry out the attack at the Islamic Center of Northeast Florida on St. Johns Bluff Road.Bolatete told the undercover officer he owned several guns, including an AR-15 rifle, police said. He also allegedly had planned the attack down to where he intended to start shooting – from inside the mosque’s tower. “It will be great,” Bolatete told the undercover officer, according to the criminal complaint.At another point in the conversation, Bolatete allegedly said he was prepared to die during the attack.“I’m not thinking of getting caught … I’ll die there in that area,” he said, according to police. “They’ll be some sort of suicide thing … suicide by police.”The suspect also allegedly confessed to killing a police officer in the Philippines after an argument about a parking spot. The date and validity of that alleged incident is not yet known.A bond hearing is set for Bolatete Tuesday afternoon at the federal courthouse in Jacksonville.A former co-worker of Bolatete told News4Jax that she was shocked to learn of his arrest.“He’s a sweet old man who wouldn’t hurt a fly,” she said, adding that she’d never heard him say anything derogatory about Muslims.Bolatete works at a liquor store, his brother, Pete Bolatete, told the television station.“He is a gun aficionado.

Sorry, Chuck Grassley.",2017-12-05,Sen. Chuck Grassley's defense of estate tax cuts over the weekend was met with derision.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a26e0a5140000436db6b941.jpeg?cache=AMB9RObIwY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Rich people are fond of liquor and films, too, according to rich people.Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) sparked a firestorm of criticism over the weekend when he defended slashing taxes on multimillion-dollar estates as a reward for those Americans who invest rather than “spending every darn penny they have on booze or women or movies.”The usual critics slammed Grassley’s remarks, which appeared in a Des Moines Register story on Sunday, as a cynical caricature of poor and middle-class Americans. The senator’s comments were also met with bewilderment by some of the very people he seems to hold in high regard ― wealthy investors, rich people’s heirs and big-company CEOs.“I could introduce you to a lot of wealthy heirs who spend on a lot of women and booze, and who basically haven’t worked in their lifetimes, who would benefit from repealing the estate tax,” Chuck Collins told HuffPost on Tuesday.Collins, who belongs to a group called Patriotic Millionaires that advocates for higher taxes on the wealthy, knows a thing or two about the good life. He’s the great-grandson of Oscar Mayer, the founder of the Oscar Mayer meat and cold cuts company. Before giving away his half-a-million-dollar trust fund at the age of 26 on the grounds of “economic fairness,” Collins was raised in a wealthy family in Detroit and even attended school with Mitt Romney.Asked whether he’d ever spent money on things like alcohol or movies, Collins said he had, adding that he enjoyed celebrating “the finer way of life.”Grassley, who serves on the Senate Finance Committee, made his controversial remarks when asked about the Senate tax bill, which would double the estate tax exemption ― to $11 million for an individual’s estate and $22 million for a couple’s estate.Under current law, the tax must be paid on individuals’ estates worth more than $5.5 million and couples’ estates worth more than $11 million. Even at those levels, only 0.2 percent of Americans pay estate tax. Just 61 people in Iowa — 0.004 percent of all the state’s taxpayers — owed estate taxes in 2015, according to the Register.In interviews with HuffPost this week, other members of Patriotic Millionaires ― a coalition of rich people who rose to prominence in 2010 by urging Congress to let the Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthy expire ― similarly criticized Grassley’s comments, arguing that such imagery is detrimental to policy making.“Republicans always think that people who don’t work, that are rich enough to live on investments, like me, are somehow better than people who work for a living,” said Morris Pearl, chairman of the advocacy group and former managing director at BlackRock, which is one of the largest investment firms in the world. “I almost feel like they somehow believe that rich people who don’t need to work are somehow morally superior. And that’s just not true.”Asked whether he’d ever dabbled in the kind of life Grassley described, Morris noted that he’s married with two children. But he added, “I do buy a little bit of wine,” and he has “seen a few movies this year.”CampusWorks chairman Eric Schoenberg, another member of Patriotic Millionaires, laughed off Grassley’s suggestion that wealthy people are inherently more judicious about their money.“Yes, I do consume alcohol,” he told HuffPost on Monday.Schoenberg made his fortune working as an investment banker and inheriting from his father.

63,HEALTHY LIVING,Should Women Be Paid For Donating Their Breast Milk?,"The Atlantic, ContributorExploring the American idea since 1857",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/should-women-be-paid-for-donating-their-breast-milk_us_5a26e03fe4b0f69ae8ce8074,"By Melody Schreiber When Ariyah Georges was born 15 weeks early, she weighed only one pound, 12 ounces. Her mother, Jovan",2017-12-05,"<p>A lab technician at Mothers' Milk Bank Northeast, in Massachusetts, pours donated breast milk into a plastic bottle for pasteurization. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a26e043140000266db6b93d.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Melody SchreiberWhen Ariyah Georges was born 15 weeks early, she weighed only one pound, 12 ounces. Her mother, Jovan, knew how important breastfeeding was, especially for micro-preemies like Ariyah, so she began pumping milk to feed her through a tube. But two days later, Jovan felt dizzy and feverish—104 degrees, in fact. She had a blood infection and was close to full septic shock.“I almost croaked,” Jovan says. She entered quarantine for nearly two weeks at the regional Northern Virginia hospital where she’d delivered. During that time, she could still pump breast milk, but Ariyah couldn’t consume it because of the risk of developing sepsis herself. Without it, the newborn was particularly vulnerable to a disease called necrotizing enterocolitis, the number-one cause of death among premature infants in the United States.Enter donor milk—breast milk purchased by hospitals for mothers who aren’t able to produce enough milk on their own, due to health complications, stress, or other factors. The milk comes from milk banks, organizations that collect, screen, and pasteurize breast milk from lactating women willing to donate. Usually dispensed in neonatal intensive-care units, the milk is only available by prescription. And it hasn’t just been found to improve infants’ health outcomes; it can lower hospital costs by reducing the number of surgeries and interventions to correct life-threatening conditions.RELATED: One Woman’s Baby, Another Woman’s Breast MilkIn recent years, both milk banks and the use of donated human milk have risen swiftly in the United States. In 2011, 22 percent of NICUs used donor breast milk; four years later, that number doubled to nearly 40 percent, and went even higher for the most intensive NICUs—as much as 75 percent. There are 23 milk banks in the United States accredited by the Human Milk Banking Association of North America, or HMBANA, double the number that existed five years ago.But as demand for donor milk rises, banks must find more charitable donors—a task made more complicated by informal, unregulated networks of milk sharing that happens online. And many of the most vulnerable infants are still not being reached.***I became acquainted with the world of human-milk donation quickly and unexpectedly last April, when my own son was born 10 weeks early. I blamed myself for his premature arrival, even though there was nothing more I could have done to prevent it. When it came to breastfeeding, my body seemed determined to redeem itself. I was lucky to have an immediate and bountiful supply—so bountiful, in fact, that I quickly stocked two freezers full of extra milk. I was producing double what my son needed, and quickly running out of room.RELATED: Breastfeeding at Any Cost?I began donating to the Mothers’ Milk Bank at Austin, which served the hospital where my son stayed. The Texas-based organization caters to hospitals in 22 states with milk from about 1,200 donors around the country. They’re on track to dispense a total of 5 million ounces by the end of this year.The screening process to become a donor is extensive. Before I began trundling a cooler packed with vials of frozen breast milk through downtown Washington, D.C., I completed several phone interviews with the bank, submitted recommendations from my doctor and my baby’s doctors, took a blood test, and filled out a detailed questionnaire to screen for medical history, drug and alcohol use, diet choices, and so forth. Once the bank received my donated milk from the drop-off center in the city, they screened it for bacteria, pooled it with other donated milk, pasteurized it, and shipped it back out to hospitals.To cover these costs, the bank charges each hospital a “processing fee”—usually $4 to $5 per ounce. The donors themselves don’t receive any of this money. Even as I pumped away, I began to wonder about the industry built upon donations from women like me. Were donors ever reimbursed for our efforts or expenses?RELATED: About That Breastfeeding Study“We don’t pay donors,” says Kim Updegrove, the executive director of the Mothers’ Milk Bank at Austin. Doing so, she explains, might encourage pay-to-pump situations where mothers are cashing in on their “liquid gold,” as breast milk is often called. What if a mother begins neglecting her own child’s nutrition in pursuit of money? In addition, one study found that breast milk available for purchase is often tainted with cow’s milk; and milk sourced via the internet may contain higher traces of bacterial contamination.Still, a company called Prolacta Bioscience, which produces a human-milk fortifier used to supplement breast milk for extremely premature babies, pays $1 an ounce to approved donors. Some moms also sell their milk outright—either to a co-op like Mother’s Milk Cooperative in Oregon or through the website Only the Breast, kind of a Craigslist for breast milk.For me, coordinating milk drop-off in the city was enough of a hassle and expense that I soon tried a different route: I found a local mother of a NICU baby to donate to on my own. I met the NICU mom online, through a Facebook group set up to facilitate informal sharing. Every few weeks, she drove to my house and picked up dozens of bags of frozen milk, which helped ease my workload as a donor. (I later learned that milk-bank volunteers may help overtaxed moms like me with milk drop-offs.)I certainly wasn’t the first person to try this approach. Social media is a major factor deterring potential donors from formal milk banks. It’s often simpler, logistically, to get milk to a local parent in need than to ship it across the country. And there’s no complicated paperwork. There are, of course, no regulations at all.For Updegrove, informal sharing of this nature is a question of ethics: “how we decide to use the limited resource for the most vulnerable.” She argues that extremely premature and ill babies need donor milk more than healthy, full-term infants. Babies fed breast milk are less vulnerable to illnesses such as diarrhea, ear infections, and pneumonia, and they are less likely to develop asthma or become obese later in life. But among premature babies, the effects can be even more profound; in addition to helping prevent NEC, breast milk can help stave off sepsis and promote long-term development. For these reasons, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends feeding preemies donor breast milk over formula when mothers’ milk is not available.The very lack of regulations in informal sharing, though, means that breast milk is often not given to the babies who need it most. “We’ve got babies who would die otherwise if they don’t get human milk,” Updegrove says. Her reasons were convincing enough for me to resume formal donations once my son’s needs eased.***Although milk banking has sharply increased in the past few years, there are still many hospitals where donor milk isn’t an option—and they tend to care for the most vulnerable babies at the highest risk of developing complications.“I know this will sound backward to you,” Updegrove says, “but we are working hard to increase the demand.” She is confident that donations will continue to go up as demand increases, because more mothers will learn about the option to donate from hospitals using donor milk.Expanding the supply of donor milk is about reaching out to women who aren’t yet aware that milk banks exist, says Naomi Bar-Yam, the executive director of Mothers’ Milk Bank Northeast and the current president of HMBANA. “There are a lot of moms who still don’t know about this possibility. So we work hard to educate them,” she says. Beyond recruiting more donors in the short term, banks also focus on strengthening breastfeeding in general—which has ripple effects for donation. Promoting a culture of breastfeeding, Bar-Yam argues, will result in more breast milk out in the world.In fact, she highlights a counterintuitive trend: “As hospitals use donor milk in the NICUs, over time they need less donor milk.” This has to do with those hospitals’ newfound veneration of the bodily fluid, Bar-Yam explains. Both the staff and the parents learn the value of breast milk, and they work harder to support successful lactation with new parents—thus decreasing the amount of donor milk they need. “Just the very fact of having the milk there,” she says, “is a very important message.”In Northern Virginia, the hospital staff encouraged Jovan to continue pumping as she recovered from her blood infection, even though she had to discard the milk during her illness. Although she was frustrated to “pump and dump,” Jovan was encouraged by the thought that her daughter would seamlessly transition from donor breast milk to her own—without ever relying on formula. In the 1990s, Jovan’s two older children had also been born prematurely, and donor milk was not an option at that hospital. “A lot of kids got sick because they had to give [them] formula,” she says.For Jovan, the message was now loud and clear: Donor milk had helped her baby, and it was time to pay it forward. When Ariyah left the NICU after 105 days, Jovan donated all the extra milk she’d saved up for her daughter at the hospital—about 350 ounces. She continues to pump about 100 ounces a month for donation to the milk bank, The King’s Daughters, that served her daughter’s hospital.“If someone else didn’t donate, it wouldn’t have been available for my daughter,” she says. “I want to help someone else’s baby the way that they helped my baby.”* This article previously mischaracterized the uses of Prolacta Bioscience's human-milk fortifier.

64,IMPACT,Heartbreaking Video Of A Cow Eating Plastic Trash Sums Up Everything Wrong With Our Oceans,Tess Riley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/plastic-trash-oceans-cal-major_us_5a214249e4b03c44072cbfcc,"""It’s not just the animals out in the oceans that are affected by this stuff.""",2017-12-04,Cal Major holds some of the plastic trash she collected on the Isle of Skye.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a2138f91400009747b6ae42.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When 29-year-old Cal Major set off to paddleboard around a remote Scottish island, she was prepared for choppy waters and a possible downpour or two. It hadn’t crossed her mind, however, that she would have to cope with the heartbreaking scene of a helpless cow chewing for at least 30 minutes on a half-swallowed plastic fishing net.The cow eventually managed to bring the net back up. But, as Major points out in the video she recorded, it’s only a matter of time before that cow, or one of the other animals on the beach, finds “another tasty bit of fishing net.”“It’s not just the animals out in the oceans here that are affected by this stuff,” she says, “it’s everything.”As a diver who has witnessed coral reef destruction firsthand, Major told HuffPost that she has always been passionate about the oceans. It was only when she moved to the southwest of England and began surfing regularly two years ago, however, that she came to see how widespread the problem of marine plastics pollution really was.“I just kept thinking how completely ludicrous it all was,” said Major, who is also a veterinarian. “I realized I had to find a way to show people not just what was happening but also the solutions.”After paddleboarding round the coast of Cornwall, collecting thousands of plastic bottles en route (“they float so they’re easy to do something about,” she said), Major set off earlier this year for a 12-day adventure covering more than 200 miles around the Scottish island of Skye. During the day she collected trash, filming her experiences as she went. At night, she camped on whichever beach she’d reached. Despite being uninhabited, these beaches were covered in bottle tops, packaging and other plastic debris that had washed up onto the shore. The result of all this hard work is “Skye’s The Limit,” a film that premiered in the U.K. this fall. It has now been entered into several film festivals around the world and will be online in full for free in 2018. For Major, the aim is simple: “to inspire change.”Unless things do change, it’s predicted there will be more plastic than fish in the oceans by 2050. Americans discarded in excess of 33 million tons of plastics in 2014, only 9.5 percent of which was recycled according to the Environmental Protection Agency. More than 75 percent went to landfill.It can take up to 450 years for a single plastic bottle to decompose ― and even longer in the ocean. Once they’ve degraded, most plastics still don’t go away completely, instead breaking down into smaller and smaller pieces called “microplastics” that are then eaten by marine life and enter the human food chain.On the policy side of things, several countries have implemented plastic bag taxes, including England and Portugal. In the U.S., the Boston City Council just voted unanimously to introduce a plastic bag tax. Similar fees and bans are found elsewhere in the U.S., including Washington, D.C., Chicago and California, although detractors claim such measures just make grocery shopping even more unaffordable for poorer residents.Some companies are exploring ways to design plastic waste out of our lives. Saltwater Brewery in Delray Beach, Florida, has created edible six-pack rings that feed rather than kill marine life if they end up in the ocean. Given that Americans consume 146 billion cups of coffee per year, according to the Carry Your Cup campaign, plastic-free alternatives to the standard to-go cup such as the JOCO cup have the potential to significantly cut plastic waste as well.“We’ve made plastic so widely available,” said Major, “but it doesn’t need to be. Our plastics pollution problem is a stark reminder that it’s easier to live without all this plastic. I’m just one person ― we need policy change and companies to step up. But we all have a responsibility to look after our world and should take pride in looking after what we love.”Follow Cal Major or contact her to arrange a screening of “Skye’s The Limit” here.For more content and to be part of the “This New World” community, join our Facebook Group.HuffPost’s “This New World” series is funded by Partners for a New Economy and the Kendeda Fund.

The show “will be presented on an interim basis” nationwide beginning Dec. 4 and will continue to air on CNN.“Christiane Amanpour is a fearless and uncompromising journalist,” Neal Shapiro, president of New York’s PBS affiliate, said in a statement. “We are pleased to welcome her to the PBS system and are gratified to offer this thorough and responsible news program to viewers nationwide.”The network said it is still working on plans for a second public affairs program to follow Amanpour’s slot.Amanpour is CNN’s chief international correspondent and has worked at the network since 1983. She has won every major television journalism award, including news and documentary Emmys and several Peabody Awards.News of the interim programming comes just two weeks after Rose’s longtime show, “Charlie Rose,” was canceled by PBS after multiple women accused him of sexual harassment. CBS also fired the host from his duties at the network’s show “This Morning.""The scandal began after eight women told The Washington Post that Rose allegedly made unwanted sexual advances toward them, including groping them and making lewd phone calls between the 1990s and 2011. More women, including a reporter at HuffPost, came forward to detail Rose’s tactics of intimidation and harassment after the report was published.Rose issued a statement last month apologizing for some of his actions, but said he did “not believe that all of these allegations are accurate.”“It is essential that these women know I hear them and that I deeply apologize for my inappropriate behavior. I am greatly embarrassed,” Rose wrote in a statement posted to Twitter. “I have behaved insensitively at times, and I accept responsibility for that, though I do not believe that all of these allegations are accurate. I always felt that I was pursuing shared feelings, even though I now realize I was mistaken.”"

Luis Gutiérrez (D-Ill.) announced Tuesday that he would retire from Congress at the end of his current term.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a22c2731900008f110341ce.jpeg?cache=hxaMPmM9WA&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Once the dust settled after Democratic Rep. Luis Gutiérrez’s surprise announcement Tuesday that he would retire from Illinois’ 4th Congressional District at the end of his term, something even more unexpected happened.The frequently disappointed activists who occupy the left wing of the Democratic Party publicly rejoiced at their good fortune.Two prominent progressives, Cook County Commissioner Jesús “Chuy” Garcia and Chicago Alderman Carlos Ramirez-Rosa immediately announced their intention to run for the seat that Gutiérrez has held since 1993. (The district, where Hillary Clinton defeated Donald Trump by 68 percentage points in 2016, is gerrymandered to bring together heavily Latino swathes of northwestern and southwestern Chicago with nearby suburbs.)For hardline progressive voters, a potential showdown in the March 20, 2018, primary between Garcia and Ramirez-Rosa, a dues-paying member of the Democratic Socialists of America, amounts to an embarrassment of riches. They see it as a plum opportunity to capitalize on the leftward drift of the Democratic Party since last year’s presidential run by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).“There is no doubt that progressive politics are the way of the future for the Democratic Party and there is a real opportunity to bring someone who represents that into Congress,” said Nomiki Konst, a former Sanders convention delegate who serves on the Democratic National Committee’s Unity and Reform Commission.“It’s a Democratic district. Why not go for somebody as progressive as possible and have a real fighter in Congress?” Konst added.What’s more, both Garcia and Ramirez-Rosa would be more reliably left-wing and anti-establishment than Gutiérrez has been, according to several activists.Unlike Gutiérrez, who backed the 2015 re-election bid of Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, himself a centrist Democrat, Garcia and Ramirez-Rosa are both ardent Emanuel opponents. The two-term mayor has attracted the ire of Chicago progressives for, among other things, closing public schools and mental health clinics and enabling the upscale development of historically diverse, working-class neighborhoods.Garcia, 61, challenged Emanuel in the 2015 mayor’s race, forcing the first mayoral runoff in Chicago history. Ramirez-Rosa, 28, has been one of Emanuel’s most vocal critics on the city council since his own election in 2015.“We saw the work that [Gutiérrez] did for Rahm Emanuel in 2015 after Emanuel had so specifically targeted black and brown communities for displacement, for gentrification,” said Emma Tai, executive director of United Working Families, a progressive grassroots organization that has not yet endorsed anybody in the race. “There’s no question that either Carlos Ramirez-Rosa or Chuy Garcia would be real champions for working people in D.C.”“Luis is friends with [Emanuel] and never really stood up to him,” said Lucie Macías, a Ramirez-Rosa supporter and fellow member of the Chicago chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America, which has not yet formally endorsed anybody in the race. “That immediately makes me feel that Luis is not a true progressive.”Sen. Sanders is another point of commonality for Garcia and Ramirez-Rosa: Both supported him in the 2016 presidential primary. Gutiérrez, on the other hand, was an ardent Clinton supporter who questioned whether Sanders even “likes immigrants” in June 2015.Although Sanders, like Ramirez-Rosa, identifies as a democratic socialist, Garcia’s ties to him run a shade deeper than those of the young alderman. Sanders endorsed Garcia’s run against Emanuel in April 2015. Garcia returned the favor by backing the senator’s presidential bid that November at a time when few other prominent Democrats were doing so.This week Sanders wasted no time putting his considerable weight behind Garcia’s congressional run, making his support public on Wednesday.Garcia “is ready and willing to stand up and fight for the working families of Chicago and our nation and take on the powerful special interests who have far too much economic and political power,” Sanders said in a statement. “He is also an experienced legislator who has risen up the ladder of Chicago’s brawling politics. That makes him well groomed for jumping into the House’s rough and tumble political battles.”Despite the general progressive joy over the primary to come, there are suspicions that Gutiérrez, who endorsed Garcia even as he announced his own retirement, had planned it all in a way that limited the competitiveness of next year’s race. Gutiérrez’s announcement left potential candidates with just six days to collect the petition signatures needed to secure a place on the primary ballot in March. Candidates must submit 864 signatures from registered Democrats living in the district by Monday, but since campaigns frequently challenge the validity of their opponents’ signatures, they’re all canvassing feverishly to collect thousands of names.“If I were the retiring congressman, it’s not how I would have handled it,” Ramirez-Rosa told HuffPost. “As the Democratic Party, we’ve learned that we benefit when we have open and contested primaries.”Garcia’s decision to run could also conveniently remove Emanuel’s greatest rival in a potential 2019 race for his third term as mayor, Chicago politics watchers have been keen to note.“Anyone who thinks more than 5 seconds about how this whole deal went down can’t help but realize things smell a little fishy,” said Micah Uetricht, a Chicago-based associate editor of the socialist magazine Jacobin.Konst, the former Sanders convention delegate, emphasized that she had no evidence that Gutiérrez backed Garcia as a favor to Emanuel. Still, she wondered aloud, “How great would it be if Chuy were the mayor and Ramirez-Rosa were the congressman?”Garcia admitted to HuffPost that Gutiérrez had both told him that he was considering retiring at the end of last week and said that he would not retire unless Garcia was willing to run. Garcia nonetheless denied that Gutiérrez’s abrupt announcement and then endorsement of him had in any way reduced the competitiveness and openness of the primary race.“With respect to the process, there is no quid pro quo. There are no pre-conditions for it,” Garcia said. “It’s not nepotism because it is not a relative handing something down to another relative.”Uetricht, a friend of Ramirez-Rosa’s and fellow member of the Democratic Socialists of America, warned that the appearance of favoritism could still poison relations between the party and its progressive base.“It seems in some ways like exactly the kind of backroom deal that people reacted so strongly against with the Hillary Clinton campaign,” Uetricht said, referring to evidence that Clinton had effectively co-opted the Democratic National Committee for her own purposes during the 2016 presidential primary. “It just further enrages the left into thinking that this party does not represent them.”In contrast with other primary battles that might pit a clearly moderate Democrat against a progressive rival, the national policy positions of Ramirez-Rosa and Garcia are almost identical. They both support single-payer health care, free public college tuition and a $15 federal minimum wage, and they both promise to take up Gutiérrez’s mantle as a champion of immigrant rights and comprehensive immigration reform.Both Ramirez-Rosa and Garcia can also claim to authentically represent the Mexican and Puerto Rican communities of the congressional district. Garcia, who immigrated to Chicago from a village in the Mexican state of Durango when he was 10 years old, is married to a Puerto Rican woman. Ramirez-Rosa, who was born in Chicago, is the son of a Mexican-American mother and a Puerto Rican father.Other candidates vying to get on the primary ballot include Chicago Alderman Proco “Joe” Moreno and Chicago police Lt. Richard Gonzalez, who has already filed enough petitions to qualify. But local observers suggest the race for Illinois’ 4th District will likely come down to a battle between Garcia and Ramirez-Rosa.Garcia, a mustachioed grandfather of six, speaks in a calm, deliberative voice as he explains why he would make a good congressman. His pitch is heavy on experience, about how he has worked his way up through Chicago politics since 1984. “I have a 40-year history of being an organizer, an advocate, a community builder in Chicagoland communities,” Garcia said. “I am an immigrant and have lived the immigrant experience in these communities in the Chicagoland region that comprise the 4th District.”Ramirez-Rosa, who sports a hip undercut coiffeur and stylish black-rim glasses, was Chicago’s first openly gay Latino alderman ― and would likely be the first openly gay Latino man to serve in Congress as well. During his briefer time in public life ― as an alderman, a Democratic Socialists of America activist, an immigrant rights organizer and an onetime staffer to Rep. Gutiérrez ― Ramirez-Rosa said he has distinguished himself by his willingness to take on more established Democrats.“What I bring that’s different is the ability to take on the establishment and win, the ability to buck the status quo and show people that we can fight in ways that others did not think possible,” said Ramirez-Rosa, a certain manic energy audible in his remarks.Indeed, in November, Ramirez-Rosa was the sole Chicago alderman to vote against Emanuel’s plan to build a $95 million police training academy on the West Side of Chicago, calling instead for greater police accountability and investment in other resources for local residents.Shortly after President Trump’s election in November 2016, Ramirez-Rosa also publicly demonstrated for the city to do more to protect undocumented immigrants, calling on the mayor to provide those facing deportation with free or subsidized legal representation. The following month, Emanuel announced the allocation of $1 million for the legal defense of the city’s undocumented immigrants.Ramirez-Rosa’s youth and combative profile has galvanized more grassroots support, according to Macías who, together with dozens of her fellow democratic socialists, has swarmed Chicago’s El stops and street corners every night this week to collect signatures for him.Ramirez-Rosa “has mobilized a lot of people in a way that I don’t think Chuy has,” Macías said. “Yes, they are both progressive candidates, but one of them has momentum and is getting people super excited about the campaign.”Neither Garcia nor Ramirez-Rosa had a bad word to say about the other.One issue that could prove contentious, however, is the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which seeks to pressure Israel to end its occupation of the Palestinian territories. Daniel Biss, an Illinois state senator seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination next year, dropped Ramirez-Rosa as his running mate in September after the alderman refused to renounce BDS.The 4th District does not have a large Jewish community. But more hawkish Democratic donors and activists at the state and national levels could mobilize against Ramirez-Rosa for failing to toe the line against the protest movement.Asked about his current stance on BDS, Ramirez-Rosa declined to either embrace or condemn it, implying instead that he favored leveraging U.S. aid to change Israeli government behavior.“As it relates to Israel and Palestine, I have been consistent about the need to have a conversation about how the U.S. government leverages the money that it has to bring about a two-state solution,” he said.At the same time, Ramirez-Rosa said he would reject legislation that in any way criminalizes participation in the BDS movement.“We have to protect the First Amendment,” he said. “Any movement or any attempt to try and take away the rights of those fighting for social and economic justice and peace in Palestine is something that I would oppose.”For Garcia’s part, when asked about any policy differences with Ramirez-Rosa, the Cook County commissioner volunteered that he staunchly opposes BDS. He prefaced his remarks by saying he wasn’t certain about Ramirez-Rosa’s position.An area where “we may have a little nuance is on the question of Israel and BDS,” Garcia said. “I have not endorsed the BDS movement. I believe in a two-state solution and the BDS movement does not address what solution there ought to be to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.”"

Gutiérrez’s announcement left potential candidates with just six days to collect the petition signatures needed to secure a place on the primary ballot in March. Candidates must submit 864 signatures from registered Democrats living in the district by Monday, but since campaigns frequently challenge the validity of their opponents’ signatures, they’re all canvassing feverishly to collect thousands of names.“If I were the retiring congressman, it’s not how I would have handled it,” Ramirez-Rosa told HuffPost. “As the Democratic Party, we’ve learned that we benefit when we have open and contested primaries.”Garcia’s decision to run could also conveniently remove Emanuel’s greatest rival in a potential 2019 race for his third term as mayor, Chicago politics watchers have been keen to note.“Anyone who thinks more than 5 seconds about how this whole deal went down can’t help but realize things smell a little fishy,” said Micah Uetricht, a Chicago-based associate editor of the socialist magazine Jacobin.Konst, the former Sanders convention delegate, emphasized that she had no evidence that Gutiérrez backed Garcia as a favor to Emanuel. Still, she wondered aloud, “How great would it be if Chuy were the mayor and Ramirez-Rosa were the congressman?”Garcia admitted to HuffPost that Gutiérrez had both told him that he was considering retiring at the end of last week and said that he would not retire unless Garcia was willing to run. Garcia nonetheless denied that Gutiérrez’s abrupt announcement and then endorsement of him had in any way reduced the competitiveness and openness of the primary race.“With respect to the process, there is no quid pro quo. There are no pre-conditions for it,” Garcia said. “It’s not nepotism because it is not a relative handing something down to another relative.”Uetricht, a friend of Ramirez-Rosa’s and fellow member of the Democratic Socialists of America, warned that the appearance of favoritism could still poison relations between the party and its progressive base.“It seems in some ways like exactly the kind of backroom deal that people reacted so strongly against with the Hillary Clinton campaign,” Uetricht said, referring to evidence that Clinton had effectively co-opted the Democratic National Committee for her own purposes during the 2016 presidential primary. “It just further enrages the left into thinking that this party does not represent them.”In contrast with other primary battles that might pit a clearly moderate Democrat against a progressive rival, the national policy positions of Ramirez-Rosa and Garcia are almost identical. They both support single-payer health care, free public college tuition and a $15 federal minimum wage, and they both promise to take up Gutiérrez’s mantle as a champion of immigrant rights and comprehensive immigration reform.Both Ramirez-Rosa and Garcia can also claim to authentically represent the Mexican and Puerto Rican communities of the congressional district. Garcia, who immigrated to Chicago from a village in the Mexican state of Durango when he was 10 years old, is married to a Puerto Rican woman. Ramirez-Rosa, who was born in Chicago, is the son of a Mexican-American mother and a Puerto Rican father.Other candidates vying to get on the primary ballot include Chicago Alderman Proco “Joe” Moreno and Chicago police Lt. Richard Gonzalez, who has already filed enough petitions to qualify. But local observers suggest the race for Illinois’ 4th District will likely come down to a battle between Garcia and Ramirez-Rosa.Garcia, a mustachioed grandfather of six, speaks in a calm, deliberative voice as he explains why he would make a good congressman. His pitch is heavy on experience, about how he has worked his way up through Chicago politics since 1984. “I have a 40-year history of being an organizer, an advocate, a community builder in Chicagoland communities,” Garcia said. “I am an immigrant and have lived the immigrant experience in these communities in the Chicagoland region that comprise the 4th District.”Ramirez-Rosa, who sports a hip undercut coiffeur and stylish black-rim glasses, was Chicago’s first openly gay Latino alderman ― and would likely be the first openly gay Latino man to serve in Congress as well. During his briefer time in public life ― as an alderman, a Democratic Socialists of America activist, an immigrant rights organizer and an onetime staffer to Rep. Gutiérrez ― Ramirez-Rosa said he has distinguished himself by his willingness to take on more established Democrats.“What I bring that’s different is the ability to take on the establishment and win, the ability to buck the status quo and show people that we can fight in ways that others did not think possible,” said Ramirez-Rosa, a certain manic energy audible in his remarks.Indeed, in November, Ramirez-Rosa was the sole Chicago alderman to vote against Emanuel’s plan to build a $95 million police training academy on the West Side of Chicago, calling instead for greater police accountability and investment in other resources for local residents.Shortly after President Trump’s election in November 2016, Ramirez-Rosa also publicly demonstrated for the city to do more to protect undocumented immigrants, calling on the mayor to provide those facing deportation with free or subsidized legal representation. The following month, Emanuel announced the allocation of $1 million for the legal defense of the city’s undocumented immigrants.Ramirez-Rosa’s youth and combative profile has galvanized more grassroots support, according to Macías who, together with dozens of her fellow democratic socialists, has swarmed Chicago’s El stops and street corners every night this week to collect signatures for him.Ramirez-Rosa “has mobilized a lot of people in a way that I don’t think Chuy has,” Macías said. “Yes, they are both progressive candidates, but one of them has momentum and is getting people super excited about the campaign.”Neither Garcia nor Ramirez-Rosa had a bad word to say about the other.One issue that could prove contentious, however, is the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which seeks to pressure Israel to end its occupation of the Palestinian territories. Daniel Biss, an Illinois state senator seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination next year, dropped Ramirez-Rosa as his running mate in September after the alderman refused to renounce BDS.The 4th District does not have a large Jewish community. But more hawkish Democratic donors and activists at the state and national levels could mobilize against Ramirez-Rosa for failing to toe the line against the protest movement.Asked about his current stance on BDS, Ramirez-Rosa declined to either embrace or condemn it, implying instead that he favored leveraging U.S. aid to change Israeli government behavior.“As it relates to Israel and Palestine, I have been consistent about the need to have a conversation about how the U.S. government leverages the money that it has to bring about a two-state solution,” he said.At the same time, Ramirez-Rosa said he would reject legislation that in any way criminalizes participation in the BDS movement.“We have to protect the First Amendment,” he said. “Any movement or any attempt to try and take away the rights of those fighting for social and economic justice and peace in Palestine is something that I would oppose.”For Garcia’s part, when asked about any policy differences with Ramirez-Rosa, the Cook County commissioner volunteered that he staunchly opposes BDS. He prefaced his remarks by saying he wasn’t certain about Ramirez-Rosa’s position.An area where “we may have a little nuance is on the question of Israel and BDS,” Garcia said. “I have not endorsed the BDS movement. I believe in a two-state solution and the BDS movement does not address what solution there ought to be to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.”"

According to The Evening Standard, the “Fleabag” actress described this past year as “a year of no apologies,” referring to the hundreds of people speaking out about sexual harassment and assault in the entertainment industry. “For all the glory, in many ways it’s been a tough year for morale in our business, with a series of dramatic revelations. Lots of men were shocked and saddened to discover that they were sexual predators,” Waller-Bridge said, later adding that “abusers are still not apologizing despite admitting” to the abuse. The award show, now in its 63rd year, took place in London’s Theatre Royal Drury Lane and was co-hosted by Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Cate Blanchett. Waller-Bridge added a powerful message to any man who thinks he may have gotten away with sexual misconduct. “A change is coming,” she said. “And for all you creepy bastards who think you got away with it, you know who you are, and we will find you.”"

Monday’s filing asks the NLRB to permit the Times staff members to pursue and vote on union membership with the NewsGuild-Communications Workers of America. The paper’s Guild Organizing Committee, the union campaign group that formed in October, said it expects the NLRB to carry out a vote on the decision next month. “It’s been inspiring to hear your stories and reasons for supporting this historic effort,” the guild said in a statement announcing the NLRB filing. “We’re excited to begin addressing the issues we’re fighting for: job security, regular pay increases, more competitive salaries, equitable pay for women and people of color, more workplace protections and other concerns.”The filing falls on the 136th anniversary of the Times publishing its first edition. The unionizing effort has been met with strong pushback from the Times’ publisher, Tronc, which warned employees last month that a union would require members to pay union dues, may cost them other workplace benefits and would not guarantee better salaries.The guild rebuffed Tronc’s attempts to stir concern about how a union would affect compensation. The publisher is spending an outsize amount on salaries and perks for its executives, the guild said, pointing to an “eye-popping” $8.1 million paid to Tronc CEO Justin Dearborn last year, more than $4 million spent on a private jet for Tronc chairman Michael Ferro and other costs on executives they say tower over what the Times’ industry peers spend.The Times staff has clashed with Tronc, formerly known as Tribune, since real estate tycoon Sam Zell bought it in 2007 and ushered in controversial staff shake-ups. Lewis D’Vorkin, the newly hired editor-in-chief, and his handling of a public spat between the Times and Disney, have been a particular point of contention between staffers and management in recent weeks. The Times is the latest in a wave of media outlets to seek union representation in recent years, including HuffPost, Salon, Vice, MTV News, ThinkProgress, The Guardian US, Jacobin, The Intercept and Thrillist.

Pamela Lopez, a Sacramento-based lobbyist, first publicly described being assaulted as part of the #MeToo campaign seven weeks ago, but kept her perpetrator anonymous, citing fear of retaliation. She decided to name Dababneh at the urging of California Assemblyman Ken Cooley (D), who chairs the Assembly Rules Committee. “Ken Cooley urged women who have been sexually harassed within the California political community to step forward and speak to the legislature and seek redress through their process,” Lopez said at a Monday press conference.She also credited the #MeToo campaign and the “moment of collective action” for inspiring her to come forward and name her perpetrator.Lopez says Dababneh pushed her into a bathroom at a mutual friend’s wedding celebration in Las Vegas in January 2016. “I was face to face with Matt Dababneh and he had very quickly exposed himself and started masturbating,” she said. “He told me to touch his genitals while he was masturbating. I thought, ‘Make it very clear that I do not want to be here.’ I said several times, ‘No, I will not touch you.’”Lopez has not filed criminal charges, but has filed a report to the Assembly Rules Committee. Dababneh’s legal team sent her a cease and desist letter last Friday, calling her claims against him “false.”“Mr. Dababneh unequivocally denies the occurrence of the incident of sexual harassment that you allege, or any other act of sexual harassment by him against you, at any time,” his lawyer wrote.At Monday’s press conference, another woman, Jessica Yas Barker, alleged that Dababneh had harassed her and other employees while she was working for him in 2008 in the state office of Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.). In an October article for the Los Angeles Times, Barker described being harassed while working in the office of an unnamed elected official.Barker said on Monday that working for Dababneh was “a constant reminder that women were subordinate in all ways.” She alleged that Dababneh once opened his desk drawer to show her that it was full of condoms, and that he engaged in inappropriate touching, inappropriate comments about his sex life, and often showed off and talked to female colleagues or subordinates about his muscles and workout routine. Barker also said that she has no reason to think Sherman was aware of Dababneh’s behavior ― he was “always on his best behavior in front of the congressman,” she said.“Prior to Ms. Barker’s article, I had never seen or been told of, any inappropriate behavior by Assemblyman Dababneh, or any disparagement of women,” Sherman told HuffPost in a statement.Dababneh now represents California’s 45th Assembly District, covering much of the San Fernando Valley in Southern California. Previously, he was chief of staff for Sherman, and worked as a staff member for former Secretary of State John Kerry’s 2004 presidential campaign. Lopez, who alleged that Dababneh had harassed other women as well, spoke to HuffPost after the press conference about the larger culture of sexual harassment ― and of silencing victims ― at the California Capitol.“I remember being 26, and I remember being 23 and several other instances of sexual harassment ... and those moments were so debilitating because I was aware of my own powerlessness to do anything,” she said. “And that is the fear of so many other women who have shared their experiences with me.” “I had panic attacks for years as a result of some really brutal sexual harassment in my work environment when I was 26 ... it didn’t involve any physical assault, but it broke my mental health. And that happens to so many women.” For that reason, Lopez said, she decided to come forward and name her perpetrator. “As terrifying as it is, it’s my job to do everything that I can do so that other women and other allies can do everything that they can do,” she said. “I want young women who are perhaps in college or in high school thinking about working in politics someday not to have to experience all of the things that I have experienced.” "

The singer has added her voice to an effort to promote more representation and transparency in the United Kingdom’s investigation into the incident.Adele asked her fans on Monday to sign a petition in which victims and their families call on British Prime Minister Theresa May “to take urgent action to restore their faith in the Grenfell Tower inquiry.”“We must keep on talking about what is still not happening,” the singer wrote in a tweet distributing the petition.Officials in the United Kingdom are investigating circumstances of the fire that killed 71 people, including many low-income immigrants, at a London apartment complex in June. Victims and their families have protested that the panel conducting the investigation is not representative of the community and has not been transparent about its proceedings, according to the BBC.Adele, a London native, has continually championed the victims of the fire, including using her recent concert tour to raise money for relief. The singer also attended a vigil less than 24 hours after the fire to comfort victims. She later thanked firefighters for their efforts, having tea with them and bringing them cake. In August, Adele hosted a private screening of the movie “Despicable Me 3” for children who were hurt in the fire."

But according to NJ.com, the 48-year-old comedian is interested in interviewing the former Fox News host.“I actually tried to get her on ‘Full Frontal,’ a lot,” Bee told an audience member at the fundraiser.Well, if Bee ever does book Kelly, she could always use this frosty anecdote as an extremely awkward icebreaker."

In the video of police at the University of Connecticut hauling away far-right propagandist Lucian Wintrich on Tuesday, he was the guy barreling after Wintrich and into the back of a cop. “I’m with Lucian!” the man said. That was Salvatore “Sal” Cipolla. He’d been buzzing around Wintrich all night, shooting video, protecting his “faggot” charge (Cipolla’s word), checking on him in the bathroom as Wintrich, a race-baiting “alt-lite” activist who works for the pro-Trump Gateway Pundit website and whom the White House has seen fit to award press credentials, applied balm to his lips before delivering an “It’s OK to be white” speech.It was a speech the UConn College Republicans wanted to hear, one about mean fat girls and “tranny” communists, the crooked elite and the lying media, one accompanied by slides of Hitler and black women in bathing suits. It was a speech about Mexican immigrants and how the real racists are on the left. The usual provocations, a sort of Canal Street knockoff of Milo Yiannopoulos’ queeny hate-ogre routine. The thrust of Wintrich’s message: Be white, be proud.But there was a more subtle message, as well: that his “alt-lite” cabal of race-baiting pro-Trump social media influencers, which also includes Yiannopoulos, Laura Loomer, Mike Cernovich and Jack Posobiec, were nothing like the Richard Spencer hatemongers of the world; that their less-brutish white identity politics had nothing to do with intolerance. “They’ll call you racists, and Nazis, but none of it is true,” he planned to tell his audience, according to a transcript of his speech.But right there, kitted out in MAGA gear and standing by Wintrich’s side, was Cipolla, a racist who has marched alongside neo-Nazis. His social media is littered with racist, hateful remarks and photos of him hanging out with David Duke and other prominent white supremacists, as well as Donald Trump-connected ratfuckers, such as Chuck Johnson and James O’Keefe, who consort with white supremacists. Cipolla’s presence alongside Wintrich is good evidence there is little that’s “lite” about Wintrich’s “alt.”A onetime member of the Proud Boys, a thuggish crew of extremists that attracts racists and fascists, Cipolla has been arrested multiple times, once for punching a 19-year-old woman.And when a woman in the audience at UConn snatched Wintrich’s notes off his lectern, prompting Wintrich to chase after her and grab her “in a violent manner,” according to a police report, Cipolla flung himself into the scuffle.It was over quickly. The police frog-walked Wintrich out of the room and arrested him on a breach of peace charge. Cipolla got a police escort outside.This may seem like a minor episode in the grand scheme of intolerance ― our Republican president is, after all, regularly tweeting the same racist propaganda as white supremacists these days. But we should note that since fans of Richard Spencer sieg-heiled in public last year, members of the “alt-lite” have taken great pains to distance themselves ― at least in the public eye ― from their overtly racist fellow travelers in the “alt-right” white supremacist movement. Their goal is to scuttle closer to mainstream conservatism by pushing off from harder-edged extremists such as Spencer, which Wintrich made clear in the transcript of his speech:Why does the media and the left try and get us to talk about him? ... Because they don’t want to talk about the real racism of society, the appalling racism that we see everywhere and that is being solely peddled by the progressive left. Think of the people who objected to the [It’s OK to be white] slogan. They weren’t pariahs like Spencer, they were well-paid university administrators, columnists in national newspapers, officials in local government. The Establishment. That’s the racism we should be talking about.Imagine this shameless contortion of logic being dropped on a bunch of impressionable young conservatives. The “It’s OK to be White” meme was cooked up in the neo-Nazi bowels of 4chan as a way to troll liberals into protesting whiteness and generating far-right propaganda. White supremacists embraced it. So did Wintrich. His entire speech was inspired by the meme and designed to normalize it.And yet he wanted to use Spencer as a foil. It has become increasingly obvious to anyone paying attention ― such as the protesters in the UConn audience chanting “Go home, Nazis!” ― that birds of a feather tend to alight on the same fasces and that the alt-light continues to provide not only a cover for the extremists of the far-right but also a conduit for their political energy into the mainstream.Cipolla was a heaving, blundering example of it.In June, this racist roustabout, while working in conjunction with Loomer, Posobiec and other alt-lite activists, was arrested for rushing the stage during a performance of Shakespeare’s “Julius Caesar” in Central Park while screaming, “Goebbels would be proud!”A week later, Wintrich appeared at a “Rally Against Political Violence” in front of the White House that began with a Trump supporter shouting, “It’s time to put George Soros in the gas chamber!” One of the groups in charge of security for the event was the 211 Bootboys, a neo-Nazi skinhead crew. Joining Wintrich at the event were Loomer, Posobiec, Cernovich and members of the Proud Boys, one of whom delivered a hateful speech about the media that had an audience member bellowing about “violent communist scum!”It’s unclear if Cipolla made that event, but he did show up in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Aug. 12 for a frenzy of white supremacist violence in the streets that left a counter-protester dead. These were the sort of conservatives the UConn College Republicans chose to host on campus.“We brought Mr. Wintrich to campus to have a conversation about identity politics, and we understand that this is a controversial issue,” the group said in a statement Thursday. “However, we firmly believe in our Constitutional right to invite him to speak on campus and present his point of view.”After Wintrich was released by the police in Connecticut on Tuesday night, having posed in his tuxedo for a smirking mug shot, Cipolla posted a Facebook live video of his associate, asking him what it had been like in the clink.“It’s basically another Shoah,” Cipolla joked. “This is basically the equivalent of the Holocaust, right?”Wintrich didn’t know how to respond. But Mike Peinovich, a neo-Nazi who runs an alt-right podcast platform and is a close friend of Cipolla’s, did. Peinovich was watching the video online and chimed in through the Facebook comments: “It’s not like the holocaust because it actually happened.”Cipolla burst out laughing. “Mike, I love you,” he said. “You win best comment of the night.”Here they were, just a bunch of pals on the Young Republican club circuit making Holocaust jokes. Just some “It’s OK to be white” bros having a lark while making racism fun again. If it sometimes seems as if there isn’t much distance between the alt-lite and outright white supremacy, that’s because there isn’t."

Their goal is to scuttle closer to mainstream conservatism by pushing off from harder-edged extremists such as Spencer, which Wintrich made clear in the transcript of his speech:Why does the media and the left try and get us to talk about him? ... Because they don’t want to talk about the real racism of society, the appalling racism that we see everywhere and that is being solely peddled by the progressive left. Think of the people who objected to the [It’s OK to be white] slogan. They weren’t pariahs like Spencer, they were well-paid university administrators, columnists in national newspapers, officials in local government. The Establishment. That’s the racism we should be talking about.Imagine this shameless contortion of logic being dropped on a bunch of impressionable young conservatives. The “It’s OK to be White” meme was cooked up in the neo-Nazi bowels of 4chan as a way to troll liberals into protesting whiteness and generating far-right propaganda. White supremacists embraced it. So did Wintrich. His entire speech was inspired by the meme and designed to normalize it.And yet he wanted to use Spencer as a foil. It has become increasingly obvious to anyone paying attention ― such as the protesters in the UConn audience chanting “Go home, Nazis!” ― that birds of a feather tend to alight on the same fasces and that the alt-light continues to provide not only a cover for the extremists of the far-right but also a conduit for their political energy into the mainstream.Cipolla was a heaving, blundering example of it.In June, this racist roustabout, while working in conjunction with Loomer, Posobiec and other alt-lite activists, was arrested for rushing the stage during a performance of Shakespeare’s “Julius Caesar” in Central Park while screaming, “Goebbels would be proud!”A week later, Wintrich appeared at a “Rally Against Political Violence” in front of the White House that began with a Trump supporter shouting, “It’s time to put George Soros in the gas chamber!” One of the groups in charge of security for the event was the 211 Bootboys, a neo-Nazi skinhead crew. Joining Wintrich at the event were Loomer, Posobiec, Cernovich and members of the Proud Boys, one of whom delivered a hateful speech about the media that had an audience member bellowing about “violent communist scum!”It’s unclear if Cipolla made that event, but he did show up in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Aug. 12 for a frenzy of white supremacist violence in the streets that left a counter-protester dead. These were the sort of conservatives the UConn College Republicans chose to host on campus.“We brought Mr. Wintrich to campus to have a conversation about identity politics, and we understand that this is a controversial issue,” the group said in a statement Thursday. “However, we firmly believe in our Constitutional right to invite him to speak on campus and present his point of view.”After Wintrich was released by the police in Connecticut on Tuesday night, having posed in his tuxedo for a smirking mug shot, Cipolla posted a Facebook live video of his associate, asking him what it had been like in the clink.“It’s basically another Shoah,” Cipolla joked. “This is basically the equivalent of the Holocaust, right?”Wintrich didn’t know how to respond. But Mike Peinovich, a neo-Nazi who runs an alt-right podcast platform and is a close friend of Cipolla’s, did. Peinovich was watching the video online and chimed in through the Facebook comments: “It’s not like the holocaust because it actually happened.”Cipolla burst out laughing. “Mike, I love you,” he said. “You win best comment of the night.”Here they were, just a bunch of pals on the Young Republican club circuit making Holocaust jokes. Just some “It’s OK to be white” bros having a lark while making racism fun again. If it sometimes seems as if there isn’t much distance between the alt-lite and outright white supremacy, that’s because there isn’t."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a257262150000de8685b584.jpeg?cache=75Yw5XYwlY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― For Republican leaders in Congress, finding a legislative solution to help young undocumented immigrants who may soon be deported isn’t an urgent problem. They figure they have a few more months before they need to do anything.“There is no crisis,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.” He added later, “There’s no emergency. The president has given us to March to address it.”“The deadline is March, as far as I understand it,” House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said Thursday at a press conference. “We’ve got other deadlines in front of that, like fiscal year deadlines and appropriation deadlines.”But for Juan Navarro, 25, it is an emergency, and the deadline is well before March. He is set to lose deportation protections under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program within weeks, potentially forcing him out of his job, his health insurance and his graduate school studies. Navarro is one of thousands of so-called Dreamers, or young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children, who could soon be ― or have already been ― affected by President Donald Trump’s decision to rescind the DACA program and years of Republican opposition in Congress to bills that would grant them legal status. Trump, Ryan and McConnell insist they have until March to act because the president’s decision allowed DACA recipients whose status was set to expire before then to apply for renewal of the two-year protections. They imply it won’t make a difference whether they do something now ― as Democrats and some Republicans have demanded ― or later. But in the meantime, Dreamers are already losing status. Some, like Navarro, are waiting for renewal applications that might not come through in time. Others were eligible to apply to renew their status but didn’t get a $495 fee and application in to the government in the four weeks they were given. While Congress delays, an estimated 122 DACA recipients per day lose their status, according to the left-leaning Center for American Progress.Waiting is doing damage to Dreamers’ lives, Navarro said.“Congress just doesn’t realize the impact this is continuing to have, the mental damage that it’s causing, the anxiety that it’s causing within the community,” he said. Navarro has lived in Oregon since he was three years old, when his parents brought him to the U.S. from Mexico for medical treatment for cerebral palsy, which left him unable to walk. They stayed in the country as he underwent surgeries and physical therapy. Navarro walked without assistance for the first time when he was 15.He applied for and received DACA for the first time in 2012, granting him a two-year work permit and making him eligible for in-state tuition. That allowed Navarro to finish a community college degree, then a bachelor’s, and now enroll in a two-year graduate study program that he started this semester, which comes with a job and health insurance he uses for physical therapy. Navarro’s goal is to work in student services at a university.Navarro’s DACA status expires on Dec. 23, and he said the renewal application he sent in months ago hasn’t come through. If nothing changes, he won’t be able to work legally and paying for school would be a struggle, if not impossible. To maintain his state of mind, Navarro said he restricts reading the news about Dreamers to once a week, but it’s still stressful telling his story over and over to administrators and worrying about the future.“To have this happen my first term of grad school and having to fight for my permit while I’m in grad school is stressful at another level,” he said. “In theory you should just devote your life to studies, but that’s not the case, because after that you’ve got to worry about what thing the Trump administration is going to do.”No one knows exactly what the Trump administration will do. The president has said he wants to help Dreamers, but he also put them at risk by rescinding DACA and has disparaged Democrats’ efforts to protect them by tweeting that the party leaders “want illegal immigrants flooding into our Country unchecked.” Democrats have called for the Dream Act, which would grant Dreamers legal status, to be part of a bill that must be passed by Dec. 8 to avoid a government shutdown. McConnell and Ryan have shot down that idea.The March deadline excuse started when Trump first rescinded DACA in September and said he was giving Congress six months to act. He did not revoke permits immediately, but instead said people would no longer be able to renew them if they were set to expire after March 5. Those whose DACA status was set to expire before then were given four weeks to apply to renew it, which left some of them scrambling for the $495 application fee.But the government said that about 22,000 people who were eligible to apply to renew their DACA in that four-week period did not do so, meaning they will lose status before March. (More than 900 DACA recipients were rejected for renewal because of mail problems, The New York Times reported on Thursday. They will be notified by letter and given 33 days to resubmit their applications.)And then there are those whose DACA status could lapse because they haven’t been approved for renewal in time, like Navarro. Some former DACA recipients who had let their status lapse were barred from renewing at all, even though they were previously eligible to do so. Based on the 22,000 figure, the Center for American Progress estimates that nearly 11,000 Dreamers have already lost their DACA status at an average rate of 122 per day.“It’s not just a looming anxiety, it’s losses taking place as we speak,” said Tom Jawetz, vice president for immigration policy at the Center for American Progress.If Congress waits until just before the March “deadline” to act, it still might not immediately protect Dreamers. It could take as many as seven months for legislation to actually begin helping Dreamers, according to estimates by the Niskanen Center and National Immigration Forum. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services will likely need two to four months to develop and implement the new program and regulations, and then another five or six months to process applications, the groups estimated.Unless Congress changes something about how the expiration process works, people would begin losing status as they wait for a program to be implemented, said Kristie De Peña, senior immigration counsel at the Niskanen Center.“In that gap time period, those people will be eligible for deportation,” she said. “When we’re looking at 1,000 people a day [whose DACA would expire], that adds up pretty quickly.”As Congress puts off passing bills to help Dreamers, it’s causing debilitating fear in immigrant communities, said Yuridia Loera Ramirez. The 22-year-old came to the U.S. from Mexico at age two and hasn’t been back. Her parents wanted a better life for their family; at the time her younger sister was born, they were living in a home made of cardboard. Ramirez applied for and received DACA in 2014, after she spent time saving up for the $495 application fee. She was able to work legally and started college. Ramirez said she was sexually assaulted during her freshman year, and having DACA status made her feel like she could safely go to the police without fear that it would lead to her deportation. She eventually decided to take time off college and is now focused full time on advocacy work.When Ramirez’s DACA status expired in 2016, she wasn’t immediately able to apply for renewal because she couldn’t afford it, but she sent in an application earlier this year with help from a friend who loaned her the money. It’s still pending, which Ramirez fears means she will be rejected.It’s frustrating watching the debate over Dreamers in Congress, where both parties are using people’s lives as pawns, Ramirez said. Lawmakers also don’t seem to be thinking about the people whose DACA has expired or will expire before March, she said, citing the estimated average of 122 people per day who have already lost their protections.“I question whether they hear that and know that and whether they really understand and get that,” Ramirez said. “Those are humans. 122 humans that are part of a family, that are part of a community, a neighborhood, that are being snatched from that life.”"

In the intervening months, however, views of the Russia story’s legitimacy had flagged somewhat, reaching a low of 42 percent in September. Nineteen percent of Trump voters currently say that the administration’s relationship with Russia is a legitimate issue. That’s up from 11 percent in late October following the indictment of Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, and 9 percent in September, but not substantively different from the 17 percent who said so in May.In a separate tracking question, 53 percent of Americans now say that the Trump administration’s relationship with Russia is at least a somewhat serious problem, and 38 percent that it’s very serious. Nearly a third say it’s not very or not at all serious, little changed from earlier in the year.A slim majority of the public, 53 percent, believes that Flynn did something wrong, with 39 percent saying his actions are part of a larger pattern of wrongdoing in the Trump administration, and a tenth that they were an isolated incident. A tenth say that Flynn ― who, as respondents were told, pleaded guilty to a crime ― did nothing wrong, with 37 percent uncertain.Responses were largely split along political lines, with 82 percent of voters who backed Hillary Clinton in last year’s election, but just 6 percent of those who supported Trump, considering Flynn’s actions as evidence of broader wrongdoing. A majority of non-voters and those who supported a third party say they aren’t sure what to make of any of it.Americans say by an 8 point margin, 36 percent to 28 percent, that they approve of Robert Mueller’s handling of his job as special counsel on the Russia probe, with more than a third not sure. Nearly three-quarters of Clinton voters approve, while a majority of Trump voters disapprove.Use the widget below to further explore the results of the Huffpost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups: The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Dec. 1-2 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population."
81,MEDIA,O'Reilly's Plan To Smear His Accusers Appears To Be Backfiring,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bill-oreilly-sexual-harassment-lawsuit_us_5a25a0bfe4b0a02abe933382,"One of them is fighting back. ""He is the liar,"" says a former Fox producer in a new lawsuit.",2017-12-04,O'Reilly maintains the women who have accused him of sexual harassment are liars.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a25b00f1900008f1e03471d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In an attempt to defend himself after numerous women accused him of sexual misconduct, Bill O’Reilly tried to paint the women as liars out for fat settlement checks. It’s an argument also employed by President Donald Trump and countless other men accused of misconduct over the years.But the former Fox News host is the one doing the lying, according to Rachel Witlieb Bernstein, a former Fox producer who filed suit against O’Reilly Monday in the Southern District of New York.Bernstein settled her original case against O’Reilly back in 2002. The terms of the settlement prohibited either side from talking about the case. But Bernstein says O’Reilly violated those terms in April and throughout the rest of the year, in talking to The New York Times and other outlets about the millions of dollars in settlement payouts he and Fox made to several women over harassment claims.Not only should O’Reilly have kept his mouth shut, Bernstein says in the lawsuit, the things he said about these women were also lies.“We want an apology and an acknowledgement that what he said was false,” Bernstein’s lawyer, Nancy Erika Smith, told HuffPost. “What he said about her wasn’t true.” Smith also represented former Fox host Gretchen Carlson in her groundbreaking 2016 sexual harassment lawsuit against the company’s former chairman, Roger Ailes. Bernstein is suing O’Reilly and Fox News for breach of contract and defamation. In her lawsuit, Bernstein says O’Reilly did not sexually harass her, though several other women have made that claim about him. According to Bernstein, O’Reilly mistreated her “frequently and in front of numerous witnesses.” She left the company “because of severe mistreatment and abuse by Mr. O’Reilly, as he knows,” the suit says. The New York Times reported in April that O’Reilly screamed at Bernstein in front of witnesses.“Bill O’Reilly has never mentioned the plaintiff’s name publicly in any context,” Fredric S. Newman, O’Reilly’s attorney, responded in a statement to HuffPost, adding that “this was absolutely not a case of sexual harassment.” Newman said the lawsuit had “no merit” and his client “will respond aggressively in court.” Bernstein’s lawsuit comes at a moment of reckoning, as more brave women have come forward with stories of sexual predation and misconduct involving some of the country’s most powerful men. These stories often wind up like Bernstein’s, buried in settlement agreements that allow harassers to continue unabated. Too often, the women who come forward are quickly labeled as “nuts and sluts,” liars or worse by the men they accuse.Not this time.In the O’Reilly case, Emily Steel and Michael Schmidt at The New York Times broke open the story on O’Reilly, reporting in April that he and Fox News had paid $13 million to five women to settle claims of harassment over the years. Eighteen days later, O’Reilly was forced out of the company. He had been one of the network’s biggest stars.The Times named Bernstein in its story via anecdotes from former and current Fox employees. She emphasized in her lawsuit Monday that she herself never spoke to the Times. None of the women who settled with O’Reilly have spoken publicly about it, according to the Times.But O’Reilly has. He told the Times that the five women were essentially lying, making up their stories to get fat payouts. “I’m vulnerable to lawsuits from individuals who want me to pay them to avoid negative publicity,” he said at the time.In September, he told the Hollywood Reporter, “Once you get a famous name, and once you’re in the political arena, the combination is devastating. If they can get you, they’re going to get you.”In another bombshell, the Times reported in October that O’Reilly paid $32 million to settle a case with a Fox News analyst named Lis Wiehl, who accused him of harassment, a nonconsensual sexual relationship and sending her unwanted pornographic material. At the time, he told the paper, “I never mistreated anyone.”On his podcast, O’Reilly has portrayed himself as a victim, according to Bernstein’s suit. He even took the argument into the biblical arena. “You know, am I mad at God? Yeah, I’m mad at him. I wish I had more protection,” the lawsuit quotes him as saying on his podcast. “Never give up telling the truth.”Noting that the title of O’Reilly’s podcast, “No Spin News,” is “hypocritical,” the lawsuit says, “Mr. O’Reilly is the liar.”O’Reilly has also claimed no one ever complained about his behavior before. “In my more than 20 years at Fox News Channel, no one has ever filed a complaint about me with the Human Resources Department,” he told the Times. And in public statements, on his website and to other media outlets, he also said that no woman had ever raised concerns about his behavior to a Fox hotline available for employees to report anonymous complaints.Fox has echoed those claims in its public comments.In her lawsuit, Bernstein says that’s not true. “Ms. Bernstein repeatedly complained to Fox Human Resources, Bill Shine, and other Fox executives, about Mr. O’Reilly’s mistreatment and both defendant Fox News Network and O’Reilly knew that before making the statements,” the suit says, calling O’Reilly a “serial abuser.”It’s typically difficult to prove defamation in court, Smith told HuffPost. But this case is different, she said, because O’Reilly is so clearly in breach of the contract he signed with Bernstein.Smith and her law partner Neil Mullin also want O’Reilly and Fox to release Bernstein and the other women from the nondisclosure agreements. “It is cowardly to publicly attack these women knowing they have been subjected to contractual provisions requiring absolute silence,” Mullin said in a statement.Trump has also painted the women who’ve accused him of sexual assault ― there are 16 ― as liars. At least one of them is suing him for defamation.This story has been updated."

83,QUEER VOICES,Here's What's At Stake In The Supreme Court's Gay Wedding Cake Case,Antonia Blumberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-gay-wedding-cake-case_us_5a25925ee4b03350e0b8a7e0,"The baker says it’s about free speech, but the same-sex couple says it’s purely discrimination.",2017-12-04,Charlie Craig (left) and David Mullins (second from left) and their supporters protest against Masterpiece Cakeshop in August 2012.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a2592d41400001d57b6b552.jpeg?cache=KhdyBBRA0p&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments on Tuesday in a case that could have huge ramifications for freedom of speech and protections against discrimination. But it all began with a same-sex couple who just wanted a special wedding cake.In 2012, Masterpiece Cakeshop owner Jack Phillips pointed to his conservative Christian beliefs in refusing to make a custom wedding cake for Colorado couple Charlie Craig and David Mullins.Phillips argues that when he designs his custom cakes, he is an artist and that he can’t be forced to use his artistic expression to send a message he finds religiously objectionable ― in this case, that any marriage other than one between a man and a woman should be celebrated. His lawyers say it is a matter of free speech.Kristen Waggoner, an attorney with the Alliance Defending Freedom who is representing Phillips, reiterated this point before the justices on Tuesday. Waggoner said the baker creates a “temporary sculpture” when he designs a cake, through which he expresses himself creatively.Some of the justices pushed back on this notion of artistic speech. “Why is there no speech in creating a wonderful hairdo? The makeup artist? It’s called an artist. It’s the makeup artist,” asked Justice Elena Kagan, according to BuzzFeed News.Justice Sonia Sotomayor noted that “the primary purpose of any food is to be eaten” and said that self-described “sandwich artists” wouldn’t necessarily claim First Amendment protections for the food they sell.The Trump administration is backing the baker’s cause. “Forcing Phillips to create expression for and participate in a ceremony that violates his sincerely held religious beliefs invades his First Amendment rights,” the Justice Department wrote in an amicus brief filed in September.But in refusing to make Craig and Mullins a custom cake, Phillips violated Colorado anti-discrimination law that prohibits businesses from denying services to people based on sexual orientation, among other factors. The Colorado Civil Rights Commission ruled against him in May 2014. Several court decisions later, the case reached the Supreme Court ― with the scope of free speech and anti-discrimination protections on the line.The implications of Phillips’ claim that he should be able to deny the couple services based on his free speech rights as a Christian are “staggering,” American Civil Liberties Union attorneys representing Craig and Mullins wrote in a brief filed last year.“People hold religious beliefs about a wide variety of things, including racial andreligious segregation and the role of women in society,” the ACLU lawyers wrote. “If religious motivation exempted businesses from anti-discrimination laws, government would be powerless to protect all Americans from the harms of invidious discrimination.”The brief noted another religious freedom case, which came before the Supreme Court in 1968, revolving around a South Carolina barbecue chain that had refused to serve two black customers. Maurice Bessinger, the owner of Piggie Park, argued that he was legally justified in refusing service to black customers inside his restaurants due to his religious belief that there should not be “any integration of the races whatsoever.”At the trial court level, U.S. District Judge Charles Earl Simons Jr. was not persuaded by that argument. He wrote: “Undoubtedly defendant Bessinger has a constitutional right to espouse the religious beliefs of his own choosing, however, he does not have the absolute right to exercise and practice such beliefs in utter disregard of the clear constitutional rights of other citizens.”By the time the case reached the Supreme Court, it was a debate about lawyers’ fees, but the justices still ruled against Bessinger, calling his religious freedom defense “patently frivolous.”The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund also held up that long-ago case in its amicus brief filed on behalf of Craig and Mullins: “The logic of Piggie Park and other precedents overwhelmingly rejecting religious justifications for racial discrimination apply squarely to the context of LGBTQ discrimination.”But the Alliance Defending Freedom argues there is a difference between his case and those earlier disputes. Phillips’ bakery serves “people of all races, all faiths, all sexual orientations, and all walks of life,” the alliance wrote in a brief, and he had offered to sell Craig and Mullins a pre-made cake. He only refused to make them a custom cake, which Phillips’s lawyers said he has the right to do as a matter of artistic expression and free speech.During Tuesday’s hearing, Justice Anthony Kennedy questioned why Phillips viewed his other cakes differently from his custom cakes. “Didn’t he express himself” when he made both kinds of cakes? Kennedy asked.Waggoner responded that Phillips’ “speech has been completed” before people buy the already prepared cakes.Kennedy seemed doubtful about both sides’ arguments, saying it was also “too facile” to attribute Phillips’ behavior to anti-gay discrimination. But LGBTQ advocates reject the idea that freedom of speech and artistic expression are what’s really at stake in Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission. The issue here, they say, is the ability of ordinary commercial businesses to use religion to pick and choose which parts of anti-discrimination law they’ll obey.“While the work that many people do is beautiful, businesses that sell products to the general public are not above the law just because there may be a creative element to their work,” Sarah Kate Ellis, president and CEO of GLAAD, said in a statement to HuffPost.Phillips defended his decision at a recent rally, telling his supporters, “I don’t create custom designs for events or messages that conflict with my conscience.” Among the other celebrations and messages he said he wouldn’t bake for are “Halloween, bachelor or bachelorette parties, and anti-American cakes.”Opponents of same-sex marriage have increasingly used religious freedom arguments to try to justify the refusal of services to LGBTQ people. Even with same-sex marriage now legal in all 50 states, some conservative Christians have argued they should be granted religious accommodations when they feel that serving gay couples would violate their beliefs.Where those Christians argue that their faith is under attack, advocates for the LGBTQ community say they are the ones whose lives and livelihoods are at risk.Already this year, LGBTQ rights have been compromised by several policy changes from the White House. In August, President Donald Trump proposed a ban on transgender individuals entering the military ― a plan that was shortly thereafter blocked by a district court. Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memo in October reversing workplace protections for transgender employees on the basis of “religious freedom.”ACLU staff attorney Chase Strangio warned of the dangerous precedent that Phillips’ claim could set. “If the Supreme Court sides with the bakery, the systematic rejection of LGBTQ people from public life will gain legitimacy and anti-LGBTQ movements will grow stronger,” Strangio wrote in a September blog post."

(They included two circles, side-by-side, overlapping slightly.) With regard to workout music, you might imagine one circle includes current Top 40 hits and another includes recent singles above 120 beats per minute (BPM). The overlapping area between these two circles would include songs meeting both criteria. In most months, this group of songs—Top 40 hits above 120 BPM—would include the most popular workout music. But, this month is different.In December, music releases are a bit more competitive—as record labels often save high profile albums to capitalize on holiday sales. On a practical basis, this means fast hits have been replaced this month with big stars. To that end, you’ll find new music from stadium acts like Taylor Swift and U2. Also commanding attention are comebacks from like Madison Square Garden headliners LCD Soundsystem and Pharrell’s club unit N.E.R.D. Finally, bucking this trend, you’ll find indie country favorites Jason Isbell & The 400 Unit and the MTV’s European Music Awards winner (in the Best New Act category) Dua Lipa.In all, what this month’s top picks lack in speed they make up for in familiarity. There’s a good chance someone below has scored some major event—or perhaps a string of minor ones—in your own life. So, this month’s playlist may provide a chance to check in, take stock, and plot the path ahead (literally and figuratively) on your next run.

Sheeran said he and Beyoncé began working on the “Perfect” collaboration in May, and that she gave him some ideas for the song. “The original version of ‘Perfect’ was just an acoustic guitar, and she rung me up and was like, ‘I don’t know how you feel about this but I’ve taken all the instruments off it and it’s just gonna be acoustic guitar,’” the English singer said. “And I was like, ‘Ah that’s great, because it used to be that!’”Sheeran said Beyoncé recorded her part of the song in just one take. “She was just like, ‘Right!’ Went in, one take, came out, like, ‘Yeah, that sounds all right!’” he said.

After saying she answered “no,” Seales claimed he responded, “Oh, right. Cause I would’ve remembered that, right?”She spliced the old clip with a new one and revealed that the “important man” in the story was Simmons.“You know how hard it was for me to say that,” she continued. “And he didn’t even assault me and I didn’t wanna say that. That’s how the game is f**ked up.” Seales continued her message in her caption, explaining that “power dynamics” in a patriarchal and sexist society make it hard for people to believe they can expose harassment and assault without being unfairly questioned, especially in the workplace.You wait because you know your vision is bigger than their indiscretion and refuse to let it derail you from your goals. You wait because you don’t even want to acknowledge the f**kery for longer than you have to when you know the odds are there will be no consequences, you’ll be dismissed, or worse defiled yet again and would rather get on with the positive things in your life. You wait because, especially when it’s a black man of prestige, you are conditioned to not speak defamatory truths for fear it will undermine their contributions to the community. Lastly, you wait, because you don’t even wanna believe it ya damn self.Seales ended her post calling for more people to call out predatory men publicly instead of simply warning women about them behind closed doors.“No matter how seemingly benign or intrusive, no one wants to endure this, particularly in professional settings,” she wrote on Instagram. “Yet, so many of us have so many of these stories and we come to operate like a clandestine anti-#creeplifes coalition of alerting others to, ‘watch out for so and so.’ Let that be no more. It is not okay. It is not the culture. It is not your fault. Expose them.”Simmons is among the most recent of Hollywood and media elites being exposed for alleged sexual misconduct in the workplace.Days after denying that he assaulted model Keri Claussen Khalighi, Simmons issued a statement addressing Lumet’s claims. HBO has since removed the mogul’s name from their “All Def Comedy Series,” and J.C. Penney has pulled his clothing line from their stores."

The tape, which features Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women, derailed Bush’s career but had no bearing on Trump being elected president. “He said it,” Bush wrote. ”‘Grab ’em by the pussy.’ Of course he said it.”Bush added that he recently went back to an October 2016 article that detailed the personal accounts of 20 women accusing Trump of sexual harassment and misconduct, including groping, unwanted advances and kissing them without their permission.“To these women: I will never know the fear you felt or the frustration of being summarily dismissed and called a liar, but I do know a lot about the anguish of being inexorably linked to Donald Trump,” he wrote. “You have my respect and admiration. You are culture warriors at the forefront of necessary change.”Bush, the nephew of former President George H.W. Bush and cousin of former President George W. Bush, was suspended and then fired in October 2016 after the Washington Post published the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape that showed the former NBC star ingratiating Trump as he bragged about sexually assaulting women.He left with a severance package worth millions and took several months off. In May, Bush said he had plans to return to TV. He will appear on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” Monday night."
