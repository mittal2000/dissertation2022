0,POLITICS,Lots Of People To Sue Texas Over Immigration Crackdown,Roque Planas,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sue-texas-immigration_us_591b6e7ce4b0a7458fa3f300,Opponents say the Republican-backed law is unconstitutional.,2017-05-16,"Texas State Sen Sylvia Garcia speaks addressed opponents of a state immigration crackdown bill on May 16, 2017. ""We tried to tell them this wouldn't help law enforcement -- it would only hurt law enforcement,"" Garcia said. ""They didn't listen.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591b70da1500002000db2ad4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"AUSTIN, Texas ― Democratic elected officials from across the state gathered in front of the Capitol Tuesday to announce plans to challenge a Republican-backed immigration crackdown that opponents describe as unconstitutional.  Activists and politicians, surrounded by dozens of chanting supporters, said they’d spend the summer rallying opponents of Senate Bill 4 to fight the new law in the courts, and to oppose Republican lawmakers who passed it. “They want elected officials like the ones standing behind me to back down,” Austin City Councilman Greg Casar said. “We’re going to give them a summer of resistance.” Once SB4 takes effect in September, local officials like Casar could find themselves facing criminal charges. Under the law banning sanctuary cities, any jurisdiction that declines to hold an undocumented immigrant in custody on behalf of federal immigration authorities would face fines and the loss of state grant money. Officials who enact such policies face the possibility of prosecution and up to a year in jail. SB4, drawing comparisons with Arizona’s 2010 immigration crackdown bill, allows police to question the immigration status of anyone they stop. But the anti-sanctuary bill signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott this month is already facing so many legal battles that opponents said they’re confident the bill will be blocked in court before it’s implemented. “We’ve heard a lot of reasons why SB4 is bad policy,” Marisa Bono, a lawyer with the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said. “But let’s be clear. It’s also illegal. It’s unconstitutional.” Critics say there’s no way the law will stand up in court. Federal judges have already ruled that requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement to hold undocumented immigrants on their behalf, known as “detainers,” violate the Constitution’s 4th Amendment, if the person would otherwise be eligible for release on bond or because criminal charges were dropped.Imposing state criminal penalties onto federal immigration law likely tramples over the U.S. government’s exclusive authority to set immigration policy. And the provision allowing police to ask for proof of legal residency opens the door to racial profiling in a state where a majority of residents are people of color, critics said. “This law creates a fake narrative that criminalizes an entire ethnicity,” Austin City Councilwoman Delia Garza said. Two local jurisdictions ― the town of El Cenizo and the county of Maverick ― have already filed a lawsuit against the state. They’ll soon be joined by others. El Paso County Commissioners voted Monday to file a challenge. Austin City Council is scheduled to vote Thursday to direct the city’s lawyers to take any action necessary to fight the law in court in order to preserve Travis County’s “sanctuary” policy, which directs local jails to disregard requests to hold undocumented immigrants on the federal government’s behalf unless the suspect is convicted of or charged with one of a few serious felonies. Dallas City Council will also consider whether to take legal action this week. It’s unclear whether the lawsuits will proceed separately or will become consolidated. Hours after Gov. Abbott signed SB4, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a lawsuit asking a federal judge to preemptively declare the law constitutional and limit legal challenges the state could face. Opponents emphasized that legal challenges were only one part of their strategy. They also plan a summer-long campaign to drum up opposition to the Republican-dominated legislature’s hard-line efforts to make life harder on immigrants. Pointing out that conservatives passed SB4 over the objections of some of the state’s top law enforcement officials, state Rep. Rafael Anchia (D-Dallas) described the bill as an attempt to score political points by targeting immigrants and the state’s Hispanic community. “If it’s not about law enforcement, then it’s about something else,” Anchia said. “It’s about conflating immigrants with lawlessness and criminality.” Karla Pérez, an organizer with the immigrant youth-led United We Dream group and a participant in the government’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, said she viewed laws like SB4 as symptoms of an effort to push people like her out of the state.“This is my home,” Pérez said. “I am prepared to defend it.”"

He memorably held up a copy of the U.S. Constitution, asking Trump: “Have you even read the U.S. Constitution? I will gladly lend you my copy.”Since the election, Khan has continued to speak out against Trump, promote civil liberties, and support veterans and Muslim Americans. His remarks on Tuesday again referenced his DNC address against Trump.“My offer to Donald Trump to read the Constitution remains standing,” Khan said. “One more time, he has proven that he is unfamiliar wth the basic tenets of democracy, our values.”Khan said Trump’s presidency so far has produced “violation after violation of our basic tenets of our constitution” and lamented that “our system of government, where we cherish separation of powers, has been maligned, time after time.”He reminded the audience that, around the world, people continue to look to the United States as a model, but “we do make mistakes.”“We do make mistakes, like last election. We made a mistake,” Khan said. “We will correct it. We are correcting it.” Khan praised “the resistance” against Trump and urged them to continue holding Trump accountable, specifically referring to the protests against Trump’s travel ban targeting majority-Muslim countries and recent GOP town halls that were packed with constituents.“In democracy, when you find that your government is not serving your concerns, the only solution you have is resistance,” he said. “Stand up, speak louder, call your senators, call your congressmen, tell them that if you don’t speak on our behalf, if you do not address our concerns, we will never vote for you, we will never stand with you, we will never contribute a penny.”"

McMaster, who had said on Monday that The Washington Post’s reporting was false, would not directly confirm or deny that Trump had shared classified information.“We don’t say what’s classified, what’s not classified,” McMaster said at a press briefing Tuesday, before adding that “what the president shared was wholly appropriate.”Trump all but confirmed that he shared classified information in a series of tweets early Tuesday morning, proclaiming that he has “the absolute right” to share any information he wants.In his effort to clear up the discrepancies between his previous attempt to deny the Post’s report, which was quickly confirmed by several other media outlets, and Trump’s confirmation of it, McMaster maintained that “the premise of that article is false.”Yet McMaster himself seemed to confirm major parts of the story during Tuesday’s contentious briefing. He suggested that Trump did not know the source of the information when revealing it.“The president wasn’t even aware of where this information came from,” McMaster said. “He wasn’t briefed on the source of information either.”The Republican in charge of the Senate investigation into Trump’s Russia ties, Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.), said he wasn’t willing to take McMaster’s explanation at face value.“Not until I talk to somebody who was in the meeting. I’ve been trying to do it all morning, but that has not happened yet,” Burr said on his way into the Capitol building. “I want to hear from somebody there exactly what transpired.”The Post reported that Trump’s disclosure “jeopardized a critical source of intelligence on the Islamic State.”“I get great intel. I have people brief me on great intel every day,” Trump boasted at last week’s meeting with the Russians, according to an official with knowledge of the meeting.Despite the grave national security implications, McMaster insisted on Tuesday that the real problem was leaks to reporters, which Trump and other White House officials have also tried to argue.Trump’s meeting last week came one day after he abruptly fired FBI Director James Comey, who had been investigating ties between Trump’s presidential campaign and Russian officials. That meeting was closed to American reporters, although members of Russian state media were given access.Michael McAuliff contributed to this report.This story has been updated with remarks from Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr and White House press secretary Sean Spicer."

In an interview with the Bay Area News Group, Guilfoyle said she had been in conversations with the Trump administration about becoming White House press secretary or taking on another press role. “I’m a patriot, and it would be an honor to serve the country,” Guilfoyle said. “I think it’d be a fascinating job, it’s a challenging job, and you need someone really determined and focused, a great communicator in there with deep knowledge to be able to handle that position.”She described beleaguered press secretary Sean Spicer as “a very nice man and a patriot” who “puts a lot of effort” into the job. A White House spokesperson did not respond for comment. “Kimberly is a valued member of the Fox News primetime lineup, and is under a long-term contract with the network,” a network spokesperson said. Through a spokesperson, Guilfoyle reiterated comments from the interview about her current job. “I really love what I do and my job co-hosting The Five is tough to beat,” she said. Guilfoyle is one of the reliably pro-Trump voices on “The Five,” which recently shifted from afternoons to primetime in the wake of the Bill O’Reilly sexual harassment scandal. She was a contender for the job before it went to Spicer in December, with chief strategist Steve Bannon reportedly pitching her to Trump.InfoWars, a right-wing news and conspiracy site, reported last week that Guilfoyle was a favorite to replace Spicer, citing White House sources. The former prosecutor-turned-legal analyst and cable news host would bring a different skill set to the job than Spicer, a veteran Republican communications official. Guilfoyle, who was previously married to former San Francisco mayor and current Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, worked in that city’s district attorney’s office and in Los Angeles before moving to New York in 2004 to host the Court TV program “Both Sides.” She served as a legal analyst on CNN before joining Fox News just over a decade ago. Trump is known to tune into Fox News in primetime, where Guilfoyle is one of leading defenders of the president’s policies and a critic of the press. She has said President Barack Obama enjoyed “a fairy-tale romance with the mainstream media” in comparison to the current president. The Fox News host hadn’t publicly disclosed her conversations with the White House on air prior to the interview, but has recently given advice on the show about being press secretary.“If you want to be successful and do communications with President Trump, you have to be someone who he actually wants to spend a little bit of time with,” she said last week on the air, according to the Bay Area News Group article. “You’ve got to insist on getting in front of POTUS, talk to him, and have like five, six minutes with him before you go out there and take the podium, and otherwise you’re driving blind.”This article was updated with statements from Fox News and Guilfoyle.

4,POLITICS,Trump's Tweets Continue To Be The Bane Of The White House,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-tweets-trouble_us_591b49eae4b07d5f6ba6d139,White House aides seem resigned to their boss ruining their lives.,2017-05-16,"The Twitters of U.S. President Donald Trump, @POTUS and @realDoanldTrump, seen Friday, Jan. 27, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591b4b551e00003a00623568.jpeg?cache=EsVYDKsJjg&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I thought they’d “cracked the code.” That was the story, anyway, back in February, when Politico’s Tara Palmeri reported that President Donald Trump’s campaign staffers had divined the key to restraining their boss’ worst social media impulses. Their advice to Trump’s White House staffers: Make sure his daily media diet contains a heaping helping of adulation, or the man would see the red mist and unleash his fury on Twitter.Of course, if you remember that campaign, you may also recall that “restrained use of social media” on the part of Candidate Trump wasn’t exactly a hallmark. Your mileage may vary, I suppose. Still, according to The New York Times’ Glenn Thrush and Maggie Haberman, it appears Trump’s current White House staff is simply resigned to their fate. The adverse impacts of Trump’s unruly habit on their lives and on the overall effectiveness of the White House is now something that’s just baked into the cake.In Thrush and Haberman’s recent report on the aftermath of the “disclosure that President Trump divulged classified intelligence to two high-ranking Russian officials,” they describe a White House staff in a miserable state, mired in chaos and recriminations. Trump, having turned “sour and dark,” apparently dressed down his aides, “describing them in a fury as ‘incompetent.’”Learning of this, the pot turned to the kettle and asked, “Why are we fighting?”You should go read the whole story, but to my mind, the most interesting tidbit involves Trump’s favorite media platform (emphasis mine):As they struggled to limit the fallout on Monday, [Sean] Spicer and other Trump aides decided to send Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, the national security adviser, to serve as a surrogate.You often hear about White House staffers, in crisis mode, talking about “getting out in front of a story.” But here we have a White House that now, as a matter of practice, routinely has to get out in front of the president, before he uses Twitter to slather on a fresh layer of chaos on top of the last. There is a very easy and effective solution to this problem. See if you can guess what it is!

6,POLITICS,"After Peddling Islamophobia, Trump To Give Speech On Islam While In Saudi Arabia",Antonia Blumberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-speech-islam-saudi-arabia-visit_us_591b52cde4b0809be158f924,This may get awkward.,2017-05-16,"President Donald Trump will address leaders from 50 Muslim-majority countries, “where he will deliver an inspiring but direct speech on the need to confront radical ideology,"" according to The Hill.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591b58901e000028006235b7.jpeg?cache=Js5s1KqTBq&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump is scheduled to deliver a speech on radical Islam to Muslim leaders in Saudi Arabia later this month, the White House announced Tuesday.Trump will embark on his first foreign trip as president at the end of May, with stops in Saudi Arabia, Israel, Belgium and Italy. The president portrayed his Middle East visit as an attempt to build interfaith cooperation among Muslims, Christians and Jews to fight terrorism. National security adviser H.R. McMaster said Trump will address leaders from 50 Muslim-majority countries, “where he will deliver an inspiring but direct speech on the need to confront radical ideology and the president’s hopes for a peaceful vision of Islam to dominate across the world,” according to The Hill.McMaster said the speech will aim “to unite the broader Muslim world against common enemies of all civilization and to demonstrate America’s commitment to our Muslim partners.”While in Saudi Arabia, Trump will also “participate in the founding of a new center intended to fight radicalism and promote moderation,” McMaster said.It’s unclear whether any of the leaders present for Trump’s speech in Saudi Arabia will be from the seven Muslim-majority countries — Iraq, Iran, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen — that he singled out in his first attempt at a travel ban.Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir described Trump’s visit to the kingdom as “a clear and powerful message that the U.S. harbors no ill will” toward Arab and Muslim countries, he told reporters in Washington earlier this month. “It also lays to rest the notion that America is anti-Muslim.”But Trump’s antagonism toward Islam and Muslims is far from laid to rest. The president’s anti-Muslim rhetoric continues to haunt his efforts to impose a travel ban on non-visa holders from six countries with Muslim majorities.The administration has claimed the proposal doesn’t constitute a “Muslim ban.” But judges have pointed to a slew of Trump’s Islamophobic comments to question its legality.“There is nothing ‘veiled’ about a press release titled ‘Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,’” U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson wrote in March, linking directly to a December 2015 statement that was still available on Trump’s campaign website at the time. Trump backed up his proposal by writing in an email to reporters in December 2015: “Without looking at the various polling data, it is obvious to anybody the hatred is beyond comprehension. Where this hatred comes from and why we will have to determine. Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life.”Trump has used other words to say much the same. “I think Islam hates us,” Trump said in an interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper in March 2016. He went on to say that his objection was to radical Islam, but added: “It’s very hard to define. It’s very hard to separate. Because you don’t know who’s who.”After a June 2016 shooting at a nightclub in Orlando, Florida, Trump called for increased surveillance of mosques and warned that radical Muslims were “trying to take over our children.”Trump’s comments throughout his campaign and after the election fueled Islamophobia and contributed to a rise in anti-Muslim incidents, which reached the highest levels last year since the period immediately following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the U.S. Last year, a report from the Southern Poverty Law Center showed that the number of anti-Muslim groups in the U.S. tripled in 2016.During his campaign, Trump liked to tell an apocryphal story about Americans shooting Muslims with bullets dipped in pig’s blood. He also once suggested that the Muslim mother of a fallen American soldier wasn’t allowed to talk while her husband spoke at the Democratic National Convention. And his inauguration in January included prayers from a pastor who thinks Islam is “evil.”The president has been largely silent on anti-Muslim attacks on American soil.Trump has also surrounded himself with a number of known Islamophobes, including national security aide Sebastian Gorka and political adviser Steve Bannon. Senior Trump adviser Frank Wuco has claimed that Muslims “by and large” want to “subjugate” non-Muslims.In December, an anti-Muslim hate group bragged about its influence in the White House, saying it had a “direct line” to the Trump administration.Chris Mathias contributed to this article."
7,POLITICS,Trump Finds It Harder To Recruit Talent As Scandals Pile Up,S.V. Date and Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-unfilled-jobs-scandals_us_591b5e97e4b0ed14cdda4128,"The politicization of agencies, the undermining of aides and the general disorder have dissuaded professionals from joining a White House that needs them.",2017-05-16,"President Donald Trump, here at a meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan at the White House on Tuesday, insists on approving all top hires.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591b602d1500001f00db2a74.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― A White House in a “downward spiral,” as a key Republican senator called it, is making an already daunting task even harder: persuading qualified candidates to take important administration jobs.Hundreds of key posts at the Department of Defense and the State Department remain unfilled heading into the fifth month of Donald Trump’s presidency because of his insistence on personally approving all top hires. And the hiring crunch started before the most recent stretch of controversy that began with Trump firing the FBI director while the bureau was investigating the Trump campaign’s possible collusion with Russia and was followed by an Oval Office meeting last week with Russian officials during which Trump reportedly revealed highly classified information. Then Tuesday came the multiple reports that Trump had asked FBI Director James Comey to end his investigation of Michael Flynn, Trump’s first national security adviser.“Up to now, many experienced national security hands had been barred from serving in this administration because they opposed candidate Trump,” said Richard Haass, president of the nonpartisan Council on Foreign Relations and author of a new book, “A World in Disarray”. “The danger now for the country is that many of these same people will opt to stay out because they oppose President Trump.”The onslaught of unflattering revelations has even some Republican lawmakers calling for changes. Tennessee Republican and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Bob Corker, a Trump ally, said Monday that the White House has to find a way to reverse this “downward spiral.”In short order, Trump has sparked a brain drain from within the government ranks ― dissuading those inclined to serve from submitting their résumés and prompting those already in place to consider leaving. One long-serving former FBI official told HuffPost that morale at the agency has cratered since Comey’s dismissal, with case agents and administrators petrified that the president is politicizing their work. “If it is political, it’s a problem,” the official said, predicting that few applicants would find the agency appealing if Trump chooses a politician to replace Comey.A similar dynamic is shaping up in the national security agencies, where Trump has faced profound and sustained difficulties recruiting staff. A Republican foreign policy hand who turned down a spot in the administration during the presidential transition over concerns about the Trump team’s ties to Russia said the situation actually looked much rosier just two weeks ago. “People were coming to the view that they could buckle down and work in this administration because they could make the administration better,” the would-be appointee said on the condition of anonymity out of fear of angering the Trump administration.That outlook has dimmed considerably. Trump publicly contradicted top aides on why he had fired Comey and then, less than a week later, put National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster before the press to knock down a critical Washington Post report Monday that Trump gave sensitive information to the Russians ― before admitting it Tuesday morning on Twitter. “To have McMaster out there shilling on this is not sitting well with foreign policy professionals,” the GOP foreign policy expert said. “They’re concerned that they are dragging his reputation through the mud, and they look and say: ‘If H.R. had this sterling reputation and may not survive this, how could I?’”Unfilled political appointments have two consequences on a new administration’s effectiveness. While some of those jobs are largely ceremonial ― glamorous ambassadorships, for example ― others entail nuts-and-bolts work. And those tasks either go undone or are passed down to lower-level employees, which in turn affects their ability to do their own jobs.At another level, though, the failure to install management-level political appointees means the career service employees who do the majority of the work are likely to continue carrying out policies laid out by the previous administration.“What we are seeing right now in the Pentagon for example ― my old world ― is careerists either trying to interpret what they think a team would want or in some cases going it on their own and for their own personal agendas taking action on certain items,” said Todd A. Weiler, assistant secretary of defense in the Obama administration and deputy assistant secretary under President Bill Clinton. “And that’s a dangerous way to do business. Right, wrong or indifferent, an administration has to have its voice at the lowest echelons of agencies, and that’s just not happening.”Republican political consultant and longtime Trump critic Rick Wilson said some delay in filling jobs is to be expected, particularly at relatively lower levels. As a young political appointee of President George H.W. Bush in the early 1990s, Wilson stayed in his job a full 14 months into Democrat Bill Clinton’s presidency until leaving in March 1994.Yet Trump’s challenge is even more difficult, Wilson said, because of his insistence on loyalty. In past administrations, the president has drawn not only from backers of his own campaign but also from those who had supported other candidates, even other party members. Trump, while he put former GOP rivals Ben Carson and Rick Perry on his Cabinet, has been less willing to hire supporters of other GOP presidential candidates.“Unless you were a loyal Trump suck-up for the entire campaign, they’re not even going to consider you,” said Wilson, who added that that criterion left just a small group of prospects. “And they’re lunatics.”Some of Trump’s problem, of course, stems from Republicans who remain absolutely unwilling to work for Trump.“I don’t know anyone who worked for the governor who would work for President Trump,” said John Weaver, who ran the Republican primary campaign of Ohio Gov. John Kasich. “Especially me.”And the more the Trump scandals pile up, Wilson said, the harder it will be to find good people.“There’s a talent gap already, and it’s going to be an even worse talent gap,” he said. “People aren’t going to volunteer for a mission that’s political suicide, that’s career suicide.”"

On Mother’s Day, the company announced a new campaign to encourage customers to offer their seats to riders who are pregnant, elderly or disabled.This initiative follows MTA’s “Courtesy Counts, Manners Make a Better Ride” campaign, which introduced signs and announcements urging passengers to be considerate of one another and give up seats to those in need.Through the new pilot program, MTA will offer “courtesy buttons” to people in need of seats. Moms-to-be can request “Baby on Board” or “Please Offer Me a Seat” buttons to wear on the subway if they wish. The buttons are free and will take approximately three weeks to mail.“Pregnant riders, seniors and those with disabilities often need seats more than others but their condition may not always be visible,” said MTA interim executive director, Ronnie Hakim, stated in a press release. “We hope this campaign will help their fellow riders to be more willing to offer them a seat without having to ask a personal question first.”Other countries have implemented similar programs for pregnant women. In 2016, the city of Busan, South Korea introduced the “Pink Light campaign” to test a solution for moms-to-be seeking seats on public transportation. Since 2005, Transport for London has offered “Baby on Board” badges to Tube riders.New York City buses and subways already include “priority seating,” which customers are required under federal regulations and MTA rules of conduct to give up for riders with disabilities.

On Mother’s Day, the company announced a new campaign to encourage customers to offer their seats to riders who are pregnant, elderly or disabled.This initiative follows MTA’s “Courtesy Counts, Manners Make a Better Ride” campaign, which introduced signs and announcements urging passengers to be considerate of one another and give up seats to those in need.Through the new pilot program, MTA will offer “courtesy buttons” to people in need of seats. Moms-to-be can request “Baby on Board” or “Please Offer Me a Seat” buttons to wear on the subway if they wish. The buttons are free and will take approximately three weeks to mail.“Pregnant riders, seniors and those with disabilities often need seats more than others but their condition may not always be visible,” said MTA interim executive director, Ronnie Hakim, stated in a press release. “We hope this campaign will help their fellow riders to be more willing to offer them a seat without having to ask a personal question first.”Other countries have implemented similar programs for pregnant women. In 2016, the city of Busan, South Korea introduced the “Pink Light campaign” to test a solution for moms-to-be seeking seats on public transportation. Since 2005, Transport for London has offered “Baby on Board” badges to Tube riders.New York City buses and subways already include “priority seating,” which customers are required under federal regulations and MTA rules of conduct to give up for riders with disabilities. The new campaign is based on courtesy and will not involve any penalties (other than perhaps making yourself look like an ass...).Campaign organizers are encouraging people who have buttons to raise awareness by posting selfies with the hashtags #BabyOnBoard and #CourtesyCounts on social media.The button pilot program will run through Labor Day.

Algohbary rushed his sibling to the Sabeen hospital, a facility in the war-torn country backed by the international relief organization Save The Children. Soon his fear was confirmed. Hamzah was diagnosed with cholera, and so were many of the other patients in the overcrowded emergency ward. With every hospital bed taken, Algohbary took his brother in his lap, holding the IV tube while on the floor. At least 184 Yemenis have died of cholera just this weekend in the capital, which Houthi rebels have controlled for the past three years. On Sunday, the city declared a state of emergency and called for international help to deal with the crisis. Yemen’s health ministry, run by Houthi rebels, said on its news agency Saba that the outbreak was “unprecedented” and had become impossible “to contain.” There have also been cases of the disease have been reported in other major cities including Hodeidah, Taiz and Aden. “There are hundreds of patients here,” Ahmad Algobary told Huffpost over the phone while describing the scenes at the hospital. “A lot of patients came from villages, from Sanaa city and around Sanaa. It is horrible situation. I can’t even walk through the hospital hallway.”The cholera outbreak in Sanaa is the second in less than a year in Yemen. More than 100 civilians died from the disease in the first outbreak in October 2016, according to the Yemeni Minister of Health and the World Health Organization. Cholera is an acute diarrhoeal disease that can be fatal if left untreated. It is caused by ingestion of contaminated food or water. Two-thirds of the Yemeni population does not have access to clean water. Population displacement, overcrowding and inadequate sanitary conditions, especially in larger cities like Sanaa with uncollected garbage, also contribute to the rapid spread of the disease. Oftentimes, civilians in the villages assume the symptoms are a case of bad diarrhea, leaving it untreated until it’s too late, Algohbary said.The outbreak poses a significant threat given the drastic deterioration of the health care infrastructure after three years of civil war between forces loyal to President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi’s government, supported by a Saudi-led multinational coalition, and Iranian backed Houthi rebels. More than half of the health facilities in Yemen are closed or partially functioning due to severe shortages in medicines, infrastructure, equipment and staff. Saudi Arabia’s imposed de facto blockade also contributes to the shortage of pain medication, antibiotics, vaccines, and other surgical equipment, according to a report by Watchlist on Children and Armed Conflict on attacks on humanitarian and medical infrastructure.In response to the outbreak, Doctors Without Borders, also known as MSF, has set up cholera treatment centers in five hospitals. The organization is also supporting several Yemeni medical centers within the country. MSF teams have received or treated more than 780 cholera patients in the past three months. MSF also reported a sharp increase in cholera cases over the the last two weeks.“We have patients coming from many different districts, tens of kilometers away,” said Shinjiro Murata, MSF head of mission in Yemen, in a statement. “We are very concerned that the disease will continue to spread and become out of control.”Of around 27 million Yemini citizens, 19 million are in need of humanitarian assistance. That figure includes 17 million people who don’t have enough food to eat.

Roy Cooper (D) promises to ""keep working every day"" for LGBTQ rights.",2017-05-16,North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D) says he wanted a clean repeal without a compromise but didn’t think it would be feasible because Republicans control the state legislature.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591b16031500002000db28ff.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D) vowed Tuesday to issue an executive order “pretty soon” to increase protections for LGBTQ people in the state. The pledge follows the state’s partial repeal of HB2, a law barring local governments from passing any anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay and transgender people. “I’m going to issue an executive order pretty soon that is comprehensive, that helps with LGBT protections and we’re going to keep working every day,” he said during the Center for American Progress’ Ideas Conference. Cooper’s office told HuffPost they could not immediately give additional details about the order.Cooper signed the compromise legislation into law in March and it’s due to remain in effect until 2020. The partial repeal keeps some elements of HB2, including barring municipalities from passing nondiscrimination protections that regulate private employment or public accommodations. LGBTQ rights groups criticized the compromise.On Tuesday, Cooper said he wanted a clean repeal without a compromise but didn’t think it would be feasible, since North Carolina’s Republican-controlled legislature operates under the Hastert Rule. That means one has to have the majority of one’s own party to get anything considered on the floor. “I had a choice. Do I continue to make a statement and pound the table and nothing happen? Or do I take a positive step, make progress and continue to fight?” he said. “I chose the latter for my state because we got rid of the birth certificate requirement. We opened up the ability of local governments to provide some protections now and some in the future.”An analysis by The Associated Press projected that North Carolina could lose at least $3.76 billion in business over a dozen years if the law, signed by former Gov. Pat McCrory (R), were not repealed. Since the compromise, businesses have reinitiated their relationship with the state and Cooper says that’s because they recognize his commitment to getting a full repeal. “I knew we had to make a step and that’s why I did it. It was the right thing to do. Diversity is our strength,” he said. “North Carolina is a welcoming state ― we’ve just gotta make sure that our laws catch up with our people.”CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated the amount North Carolina was predicted to lose under HB2 as well as the time frame of that loss. It is $3.76 billion over a dozen years, not $376 billion already lost."

What happened instead surprised her.Farrell took her son, 6-year-old Jaiden Farrell-Harris, to a beauty supply store in Neptune, New Jersey, on April 23. She told HuffPost that Jaiden was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder a few months after his second birthday. When they arrived at the store, Farrell knew her son was restless and hungry and remained patient with him as he touched things in the store and ran through the aisles. “He couldn’t really help it and wasn’t trying to cause trouble, and I knew that, so I was going after him and trying to calm him down and put the items back in their right place,” she said.Farrell expected an employee from the store to stare or say something once they saw what Jaiden was doing since she has experienced similar reactions in the past. Instead, a woman at the store kindly interacted with the 6-year-old.“She was so kind and it caught me off guard,” Farrell said. “When Jaiden went to the sunglasses and kept touching them, she approached him calmly, and asked him to put them on so she could see how cool he looked. He got so happy and quickly put them on.”Farrell told HuffPost the woman then held a mini “fashion show” for Jaiden, letting him pose as she snapped photos and complimented him and his sunglasses. “It was beautiful to witness,” she said.Farrell decided to post about her son’s encounter with the woman on Instagram, writing, “I just wanted to share this story because I always read other stories from parents of a worker or a stranger going above and beyond for their autistic/special needs child and they always make me so happy.”She said Jaiden cried when he had to leave his “new friend.” The next Sunday, though, he got to see her again because he and his mom visited and brought her chocolate ice cream. Jaiden had remembered that it was her favorite flavor. Farrell, who said she and Jaiden plan to continue visiting his friend, told HuffPost that in the past she has been judged and that people have been rude to her about her son.“People on the outside looking in tend to be so quick to judge and stare, even get upset and rude,” she said. “One person even called my son ‘bad’ during one of his meltdowns, and the lack of understanding is so unfortunate, because in those moments, an autistic child is not bad, they are suffering.”This woman, though, reassured her that many people still value the importance of kindness.“As an autism parent, moments like that in public are both exhausting and nerve-racking, but she made it special.”The HuffPost Parents newsletter, So You Want To Raise A Feminist, offers the latest stories and news in progressive parenting.

The attacks, which slowed on Monday, are among the fastest-spreading extortion campaigns on record.The research will be closely followed by law enforcement agencies around the world, including Washington, where President Donald Trump’s homeland security adviser said on Monday that both foreign nations and cyber criminals were possible culprits.The two security firms said they needed to study the code more and asked for others to help with the analysis. Hackers do reuse code from other operations, so even copied lines fall well short of proof.U.S. and European security officials told Reuters on condition of anonymity that it was too early to say who might be behind the attacks, but they did not rule out North Korea as a suspect.FireEye Inc (FEYE.O), another large cyber security firm, said it was also investigating a possible link.“The similarities we see between malware linked to that group and WannaCry are not unique enough to be strongly suggestive of a common operator,” FireEye researcher John Miller said.The Lazarus hackers, acting for impoverished North Korea, have been more brazen in pursuit of financial gain than others, and have been blamed for the theft of $81 million from the Bangladesh central bank, according to some cyber security firms. The North Korean mission to the United Nations was not immediately available for comment.Regardless of the source of the attack, investors piled into cyber security stocks on Monday, betting that governments and corporations will spend more to upgrade their defenses.SMALL PAYOUTThe perpetrators had raised less than $70,000 from users paying to regain access to their computers, according to Trump homeland security adviser Tom Bossert.“We are not aware if payments have led to any data recovery,” Bossert said, adding that no U.S. federal government systems had been affected.WannaCry demanded ransoms starting at $300, in line with many cyber extortion campaigns, which keep pricing low so more victims will pay.Still, some security experts said they were not sure if the motive of WannaCry was primarily to make money, noting that large cyber extortion campaigns typically generate millions of dollars of revenue.“I believe that this was spread for the purpose of causing as much damage as possible,” said Matthew Hickey, a co-founder of British cyber consulting firm Hacker House.The countries most affected by WannaCry to date are Russia, Taiwan, Ukraine and India, according to Czech security firm Avast.The number of infections has fallen dramatically since Friday’s peak when more than 9,000 computers were being hit per hour. Earlier on Monday, Chinese traffic police and schools reported they had been targeted as the attack rolled into Asia for the new work week, but no there were no major disruptions."

It should be required viewing for… well, everyone, especially people who are not natural dot-connectors.The conception, birth and delivery of a dictatorship parallels a society’s relationship with women and reproduction. This is not theory, it is practice all over the radical right-wing world. Since the advent of the written word, there has been a war on women. If you think that statement is hyperbole, read Riane Eisler’s “The Chalice and The Blade” and Leonard Shlain’s “The Alphabet Versus the Goddess” and think again.Sinclair Lewis, the author of another eerily prescient book “It Can’t Happen Here,” is credited with saying, “When fascism comes to America, it will be wrapped in a flag and carrying a cross.” He forgot to mention “and stripping women of their human rights,” which is as predictable as the march toward theocracy both here and abroad.“Oh but Ellen! You’re such an alarmist!” I wish I had a dollar for every time someone has said that to me. “No one will ever overturn Roe v. Wade: that’s established law!” or “Contraception is really a conservative idea and family planning is good for everyone!” Ha!I went to high school with friends who are now fundamentalist Christians and Trump supporters. They see the proper role of men as superior to women, period. While they and their ilk may give lip service to the idea that women are special or blessed, the “pedestal” approach to worshipping women boils down to their BQ, a term I created and have used over the years; it stands for “Breedabilty Quotient.” This worship — and simultaneous hatred — of females is not unique to radical Christianity, as many other fanatical Abrahamic brothers share it as well. When Christians brag about how their value systems are more advanced than Islamic Sharia law, I have to laugh. Timothy McVeigh was as murderous as any radical jihadist. And don’t get me started on the radical Jewish cults that keep women as suppressed as any radical Christian or Islamic sect.As many of us watch “The Handmaid’s Tale,” we are disgusted and fascinated in turns. The show has excellent production values, great acting, and is highly entertaining: an emotional and adrenalin producing spiritual roller-coaster. There are even unofficial drinking and other online games that accompany the show.For example, Karin Rose — an art director in Chicago — developed a set of parody bingo cards billed as “(unofficial) HANDMAID’S BING-Oh” to avoid any copyright problems. Bingo is after all a connect-the-dots game, thus the “Oh.” Her instructions read: “1) Check off the issues on your card that occur in this dystopian tale and that also occurs in our society today. 2) The first person to complete a line shouts “BING-Oh and becomes the winner! 3) For everyone to win — start fighting for women’s rights, like NOW.”I started fighting for women’s rights when I was in my teens, while also having an extremely high BQ. I rejected marrying men for security, instead opting for actual compatibility as partners and human beings. Today I’m a woman who no longer has BQ going for her. As a result my worth as a person has tanked, not only in Gilead — the fictional country where “The Handmaid’s Tale” takes place — but in contemporary times too. I get reminded of this almost daily. A particularly dickish man I saw at a memorial just stared at me while I was speaking and then walked away. Younger men don’t return smiles or even say hello. Women of all ages also treat themselves and other older women as non-entities, or as they’re called on the show an “unwoman.” Over 40 and we’re MIA, everywhere. It’s weird being invisible after formerly being considered a “catch”: white, blonde, blue-eyed, well-educated, with mid-western TV broadcaster non-threatening good looks, i.e., good breeding stock.I am so grateful Ms. Rose’s BING-Oh includes “Women are told they need protection” which is my bailiwick: empowering women and girls to protect themselves emotionally, verbally and physically. What is missing on these mock bingo cards is stripping all of us of our histories. If an alien came down and read our history books or visited our museums, they would conclude that female humans just haven’t done much or contributed to society in any significant way — other than look nice. THAT is a sure fire way to inculcate a huge group with their own worthlessness.The development of so-called women’s museums, (we don’t call other museums “men’s museums” although by content that’s mostly true) is of primary importance so we can see the shoulders we all stand on. Visit the Women’s Freedom Museum for the genesis of an exciting vision. I’m also proud to say the museum has chosen my work, as represented from my documentary film Beauty Bites Beast, as a representative organization in the “Self Defense” category. Speaking of the film, I have a new “Bad-Ass Building Blocks” segment which you can see here. Women and men benefit from knowing about women and girls of the past.Time for all our BAD-ASSES to step forward. Men: do you really think you’re not needed for so-called women’s issues? You are! In this real life game of BING-Oh, you’re also losing to those wrapped in the flag, carrying a cross and denying women’s rights. If you’re not part of the solution, you are part of the problem."
18,THE WORLDPOST,Why Multi-hazard Early Warning Makes Sense,"A View From The United Nations, ContributorSenior officials speak on global issues",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-multi-hazard-early-warning-makes-sense_us_591b3914e4b0f31b03fb9f70,By Robert Glasser* It is 19 years since the world first met to discuss global early warning for natural hazards in Potsdam,2017-05-16,"<p>An aerial view of the tsunami-ravaged village of Kolhuvaariyaafushi, located in the Madlives’ in the southwestern Mulaaku Atoll, in January 2005.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591b3bb61500002600db29ce.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Robert Glasser*It is 19 years since the world first met to discuss global early warning for natural hazards in Potsdam, Germany. Since then events have only underlined how important early warning systems are for saving lives across the globe.Six years after that gathering, the failure to have a tsunami early warning system in place in the Indian Ocean contributed to the death toll of 230,000 in the 2004 tsunami.The infrequency of tsunami events in the Indian Ocean explains why there was no such system in place while one had been installed in the Pacific Ocean 55 years earlier in 1949, following the Aleutian Island earthquake which resulted in 165 casualties.Filling obvious gaps can justify the expense of a single hazard early warning system as in the case of Bangladesh which has lost hundreds of thousands of lives to cyclones but has reduced the death toll significantly in the last two decades thanks to an effective community-based cyclone preparedness programme.However, it is often the case, particularly in developing countries, that a multi-hazard approach makes more sense economically, and operationally, especially in parts of the world exposed to many different types of hazard.That is one key reason why the Mexican Government, the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR), and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), with many partners, are organizing the first-ever Multi-Hazard Early Warning Conference over two days beginning next Sunday,This is timely in the context of extreme weather events that have doubled over the last 40 years and continue to claim many lives and cause huge economic losses particularly in countries which struggle to maintain viable climate and weather information services.The breakthroughs in the use of space-based technologies and satellite meteorology have led to an astonishing improvement in weather forecasts over the last 50 years.The ever present challenge remains though, how to get the right information in a timely manner to the people who need to take action. When warnings are shared in a way that all affected can act, for example through standardized messages from an authorized source on social media and mobile phones, both lives and livelihoods can be saved.Cyclone Nargis which struck Myanmar in 2008 killing 138,000 people illustrates another reason why the multi-hazard approach is a good option. Warnings were provided by the Myanmar Meteorological Service but other elements of an effective early warning system were absent including communications and people’s preparedness to act. It was also an unusual storm which did not follow “normal” cyclone tracks but struck from the west along a remote stretch of coast where much of the protective mangrove forest had been chopped down.Historical patterns are no longer reliable guides and the adoption of an end-to-end, multi-hazard approach can prepare countries to take on the challenge of anomalous events, the likelihood of which are only increased by climate change.Early warnings however must also convey clearly the likely impact of the forecast event. As the WMO Secretary-General, Petteri Taalas, says: “Put simply, while there is a realization of what the weather might be, there is frequently a lack of understanding of what the weather might do.”A single hazard event such as a tropical storm can have a cascading series of impacts including high winds, storm surge, coastal inundation, inland flooding, heavy rains leading to disruption of water and sanitation systems, power supply, closure of roads, damaged housing, unravelling of supply chains and damage to agriculture.The solution is not an overarching - one-size-fits-all-hazards – approach. A focus is required on the logical links between certain hazards through shared observation systems e.g. rain gauges which assist in calculations on the likelihood of floods or drought, or satellite systems which aid in estimating the likely impacts on exposed and vulnerable populations of an incoming storm.Excessive focus on technology without paying attention to the challenges in dissemination and communication - the fabled “last mile” - is a danger the Climate Risk Early Warning Systems (CREWS) addresses. CREWS is a partnership of WMO, the World Bank and UNISDR, announced by France two years ago, intended to strengthen end-to-end multi-hazard early warning systems in several least developed countries. CREWS, with USAID and the Government of Spain, are also financing the two-day Conference (22-23 May).Multi-hazard early warning systems are essential to achieving reductions in loss of life, the numbers of people affected by disasters, economic losses and damage to critical infrastructure – targets which Governments have agreed to under the global plan for reducing such losses, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.The Sendai Framework also commits UN member States to having in place national and local disaster risk reduction strategies by 2020 which will inevitably have a focus on early warning as the bedrock of any plan to reduce disaster losses.Two events will help to concentrate minds at the Conference: the beginning of the Atlantic Hurricane Season in June and the 50% to 60% possibility of El Niño returning later this year. We have been warned.*Robert Glasser is the UN Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction and head of the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction."

You know the one I mean. Instead of starting his typical history lecture, he started talking to the class about President Donald J. Trump’s proposed border wall with Mexico, saying things like, “I know I’m a professor, but I have biases.”I looked around the lecture hall. All around me, kids were nodding and doing that snapping thing with their fingers. A lot of people were like, yeah, we’re getting our free speech on. I smiled and didn’t say anything. I knew I was outnumbered.That’s pretty typical when you’re a Republican at UC Berkeley.I’ve been a Republican as long as I can remember. I’m used to be surrounded by people who disagree with me. I grew up in predominantly “blue” city ― Miami, Florida ― and went to a liberal-leaning high school. I really like having debates and discussions about politics. That’s part of what I hoped to find when I decided to go to UC Berkeley, one of the most liberal campuses in the United States, for undergrad. But instead of discovering open-minded individuals ready to debate their views, I found myself silenced by my liberal peers. In search of political and moral support, I joined the Berkeley College Republicans at the beginning of this past school year.Being an official member of that organization has its ups and downs. It’s nice to talk openly about my political opinions, but it comes with a price. When I staff the group’s table on Sproul Plaza, strangers come up to yell at me ― and not in a fun “I want to debate you” kind of way. They call me a bad person. They ask me where I’m from (my family is from Cuba) and then tell me to go back there. I’ve even been physically attacked.And you know what? I get it. The organization has a bad name on campus. Affirmative action bake sales (that was before my time), Anne Coulter speaker requests, the whole Milo Yiannopoulos thing. Don’t get me wrong, I believe in a healthy dose of controversy, but in my opinion, asking “Would you rather your child get feminism or cancer” isn’t controversial, it’s horrible. I have no interest in being around anyone who is alt-right. And most people ― Berkeley Republicans included ― don’t actually want these extreme speakers to show up. Yes, being provocative irritates the liberal masses, which can be funny, but in the end, it’s self-promotional, not thought-provoking. Some people say Berkeley College Republicans represent the new Free Speech Movement. That’s B.S. ― It’s playing the victim card, which, in my mind, is something Republicans just don’t do. And yet, I remain a member of the club, because I want to change Berkeley College Republicans from the inside. Until the hard-core conservatives and liberals around me tone things down, I feel like I’m a moderate stuck in the middle, fighting for reasonable discussion on two fronts.I understand that Republicans at Berkeley may never be the majority. I would settle just to be tolerated. The way things are now, I feel like expressing my political opinions in class would be detrimental to my education. There are certain departments on campus I’m not sure would welcome a conservative student. It’s like I’m playing a four-year game of “Would You Rather.” Would I rather keep my mouth shut and get good grades, or express myself and feel ostracized from my teachers, classmates, and professors? For now, at least in class, I choose to be silent. But I hope it’s not like that forever.I want to listen to people who are interested in backing up their opinions ― even those that are different from my own ― with facts and sources. But that won’t happen as long as people on campus say “Republican” like it’s a dirty word.And yet, I have hope. Occasionally, when I spend all day tabling on Sproul, there are some individuals who will come up to me and engage in a lively conversation ― a real conversation. We’ll go back and forth on the ethics of abortion, or global warming, or gun regulations. In some cases, we start agreeing and coming up with new ideas on how to tackle these issues. And in those moments, it feels like the UC Berkeley I originally came for.Jonathan Chow recently completed his third year at UC Berkeley.

20,HEALTHY LIVING,"If '13 Reasons Why' Scared You As A Parent, Here's Some Help To Keep Your Teens Talking To You","Katherine Hedland Hansen, ContributorMom, writer, observer, communicator",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/if-13-reasons-why-scared-you-as-a-parent-heres_us_591b49d6e4b03e1c81b0097f,I hadn’t planned on watching the Netflix series “13 Reasons Why” about a teenage girl who kills herself and leaves behind,2017-05-16,<p>Clay’s mom tries in vain to get her son to talk to her in a scene from “13 Reasons Why.”</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591b4ab21500002900db2a0e.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I hadn’t planned on watching the Netflix series “13 Reasons Why” about a teenage girl who kills herself and leaves behind tapes for all the people who wronged her. But when I overheard my 10-year-old son and his friend talking about it, I figured I better check it out. He hadn’t seen it (and won’t for several years) but I was surprised he even knew about a show intended for much older kids, with heavy plot lines about suicide, rape, bullying, and drug and alcohol abuse.As I watched the show from the perspective of a parent who has already been through the trying teen years with my oldest child, what bothered me most is how these parents had no idea what was going on with their kids. Throughout the 13 episodes, we see various parents, mostly well-intentioned, loving, caring — and completely clueless parents — try to reach their teenagers who are going through pain they can’t imagine.Take this:Clay’s mom goes to her sensitive and struggling son’s room to again try to get him to open up. He assures her he’s fine.“You’re not fine. You haven’t been for a while.”I don’t want to talk about it,” he says.“You have to tell me what’s going on,” she continues.He approaches her, and she looks at him hopefully.“You can’t help me, Mom,” he says, closing the door on her.Ouch.I’ve read a lot of articles offering advice about how parents should talk to their kids about “13 Reasons” (and many that call the show irresponsible and argue it should not even air). Yes, this fictional show could be a springboard for difficult conversations. But what about our actual kids? How do we make sure we know what our kids are dealing with IRL?Clay’s parents try different approaches. His perky mom decides to start a daily family breakfast, since they rarely see each other for dinner. He’s not really into it, but his parents keep trying. As he gobbles a few bites one morning, his mom says she has something to discuss with him. He immediately jumps from the table, grabs his backpack and heads out the door.Another heart-breaking scene takes place on the steps of Clay’s house, as his dad makes an effort, telling him how hard high school was for him. What helped him, was had things to hang onto.“Do you have something? Does anything bring you joy, or just relief? Your mom and I would feel so much better if you had something.”There are other examples. The troubled Jessica hides vodka under her covers to numb her pain, but when her dad comes to her door to say goodnight, she tells him she’s fine. (That word again!)And Hannah’s devastated parents saw no signs their daughter was planning to take her own life. She didn’t tell them about anything she’d been going through before she slit her wrists (be forewarned parents: this is a stomach-turning, gruesomely realistic scene). And they’re left sifting through her things, searching for any clues that she was not at all fine.So what are we parents to do prevent the tragedies these characters suffer? Experts offer some guidance to encourage your teens to come to you with their problems.Understand that times have changed“Kids these days are having an experience of the world that we could not ever imagine. They know so much more than we ever did at their ages,” says parenting expert Amy Lang, who has been working with families for 25 years. “And just like every other teen since the beginning of time, they think they know it all have it all down.”Remember, they are figuring out who they are, and part of that means separating themselves from their parents. Dr. Gregory Jantz, a mental health expert and author several books about adolescence including “When the Teenager Becomes a Stranger in Your House,” says two main questions drive kids through middle school and high school: “Who am I?” And “Where do I belong?”Kids compare themselves to others, feel inferior, and wonder if they are pretty enough, cool enough, good enough. Jantz, says teenage depression and anxiety are at an all-time high, some of which he attributes to the prevalence of technology and social media.“There’s more coming at them than ever before,” Jantz says. “The pressures are different, and there are more of them.”Create trustJantz, who runs a mental health facility outside Seattle, encourages parents to be alert and vigilant, but not to push. Teenagers become experts at telling adults what they think we want to hear, and sometimes we’re so afraid of butting in, we accept what they say without question or demand answers they’re not ready to give.“When we’re talking to our kids, it’s important to allow time and space,” he said. “We want to build that bridge of trust. If we are over-forcing or over-demanding or over- shaming, we can lose that trust.”Lang says you can write a letter, or tell your child know that you suspect something is going on. Tell them while you respect their privacy, it’s a good idea for them to let someone know what’s up and then give them options: you, another trusted adult, their medical care provider, the school counselor or a therapist.“It’s helpful to share stories about when you were their age and troubled about someone, and how you totally messed it all up because you thought you could handle it and you really could not,” Lang says.Skip the judgmentLang says parents need to listen to teens, and attempt to see their point of view, and respond without judgment. The most important thing parents can do is not freak out over little stuff.“If you get all crazy-pants when you see one of their friends dressed like Gothic Nightmare or a trollop and talk about how awful they look and are super judgmental about something like this, you pretty much tell your kid that you can’t handle, well, much of anything,” she warns. “Why on earth would they tell you that they think they are gay or had sex with their boyfriend or girlfriend or are depressed or sad or whatever, if you can’t even handle something as superficial as a teenager’s clothing choice?”Watch for warning signs Jantz said there are warning signs that can be subtle or obvious: academic struggle, isolation, choosing not to be part of the peer group they used to be with, spending all their time in their rooms, sleeping too much or not enough, escaping into technology.Sometimes, even the most vigilant parents don’t know how bad it is until their family is dealing with an eating disorder, substance abuse, early pregnancy, or self-harm.“These are high stakes so, as a parent, I’d rather look ridiculous and be considered as overacting than be wrong and left wondering why I didn’t do something sooner,” Jantz says.Be patient. And be there.Above all, Jantz said, keep the relationship going.“Ultimately when they want to talk or they need something, we want to have mom or dad in the picture and offering a safe place for them.”“Bottom line, show up for your kids like you would want your BFF to show up for you in your daily life,” Lang adds. “This doesn’t mean you abdicate your throne as their parent, it means you change your behavior to mimic that of a close friend. This is the place where connection happens. And it needs to happen daily for their trust in you to increase.”All this helps ensure that when your kids are looking for someone to talk to, they will choose you.“Often, they will pick you because they need to get it off their chest and you are handy,” Lang says. “You may need to wait a bit, but they will usually get there.”Some of the characters on the show eventually do get there. At the end of the series, Jessica finally divulges what she has been through. Her dad asks if she’s OK, and she gives the stock answer: she’s fine.“You don’t look fine,” he says.And finally she tells him the truth.Let’s hope our kids trust us enough to do the same.If you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for the National  Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

It would appear there is no rhyme or reason to account for the miasma of messages that begin with an early-morning Trumpian Tweet, spread as “Breaking News” into the national newsrooms, ooze into Congressional offices, and invade the personal messaging spaces of the average American—only to be refuted by Sean Spicer at his daily news briefing a few hours later. And then to be re-refuted, retracted, or morphed into a new reality by the President by tweet the next morning.What are we to make of this broken chain of custody of the truth? More important, is there any truth to begin with? There is a reality show—of that there can no longer be any doubt—but is there any reality to it? Is there any “there” there? Evidence welling up from sources within and outside the White House suggests that whatever the definition of “there” is, it is not a place where facts, discussions, open debate, honest counseling, and hard decisions on behalf of the nation are made. I recently created a graphic of a Schrödinger’s White House, inside of which truth is both alive and dead.With respect to the latest story about Mr. Trump’s decision to discuss, imprudently to say the least, matters of great national and international security with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, I heartily recommend a close reading of a blog posted by Lawfareblog.com, and written by Jack Goldsmith, Susan Hennessey, Quinta Jurecic, Matthew Kahn, Benjamin Wittes, and Elishe Julian Wittes. Titled, “Bombshell: Initial Thoughts on Washington Post’s Game-Changing Story,” the article posits nine points of consideration addressing Trump’s behavior and its ramifications.It is not my intention here to review or re-state the LawFare blog; the authors speak eloquently and credibly. But I mention the blog because it responds calmly to an otherwise visceral impulse on the part of many Americans to throw up their hands in disgust and dismay and wonder what last-straw is needed to collapse the Trump presidency?That’s not all Americans, of course, because, there are, as my wife noted when the news broke and we were discussing just how long even the most ardent Trump supporters could hold on to their God-elect, there are sure to be some “Trot-‘em-out-apologists” eager to appear on the media stage to heap praise on Trump and throw cow patties at the media. [as an aside, I must say that when it’s italicized, Trotemoutapologists does look a bit like an endangered species]Well, I hate to break it to those who are looking at this event as the final straw, but it was not that straw. It was not even close. This is a most inconvenient truth for many Trump deniers, but truth it is.I must admit that when I saw the Washington Post’s “breaking news” banner scroll across my monitor, the headline seemed to present the ultimate indictment of the president’s incoherence in all things pertaining to his job. I was overtaken by a thrill of watching the bull of the media finally lays its horns deep into the matador who has been relentless in diverting and wounding the bull.“Ah ha!” now he’s done it!” was my very first reaction. I can be forgiven, I hope, for such a thought, because earlier in the day I’d watched Sean Spicer’s WH press conference during which Sean repeatedly pushed back on questions about the possibility of a recording system in the White House by saying, over and over, “The President stands by his position.”Time and again, Spicer and his backup colleague, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, have used the press room podium as a pedestal from which to regurgitate flat-out lies, misinformation, and nonsensical statements of implausible and indefensible presidential comments and Tweets. From the size of inaugural crowds to attacks on federal judges and circuit courts, to denials about Michael Flynn, to the firing of Sally Yates and the mashup of mixed stories surrounding Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Jim Comey’s dismissal, to the veiled threats to use “tapes” of conversations, to this latest breach of intelligence information to the Russians, the increasing volume of Babel-esque noise from the White House has reached brain-hurting levels.As I reread the Post’s headline, and watched CNN’s hyperbolic coverage, I remembered this miserable fact: Not one thing the president has done so far is enough to move the needle off the peg of stupid toward the peg of impeachment or indictments for high crimes. The president can, at will, reveal the most highly sensitized information—he’s the ultimate declassifier. As one pundit observed on CNN yesterday, if the president wanted to write down the nuclear codes on yellow sticky and take a picture of it, he could. If he wanted to—or if he has—set up a private recording system in the White House, he could and not be breaking any law (the recordings belong to the public, so he can’t walk out the door with them, and he can’t destroy them). He can fire his appointees, or certain appointed officials (like Comey) with impunity. He can even see to it that his children and their spouses are accommodated in White House offices. And, he can share sensitive information with an adversary who is playing him like a balalaika.Now, if ignorance, arrogance, self-aggrandizement, self-endowed invulnerability to facts, abuse of trust, sexist braggadocio, humiliation, creepiness, and running roughshod over democratic values were impeachable offenses, Trump would be out by now. But he gets a pass on all those negatives because no matter how distasteful his actions are, they are only embarrassments that stain America in the eyes of the world. And that’s not a crime for which he can be punished except at the ballot box."

They continue to move through a series of highly qualified candidates.”In March, Sessions issued a statement promising, “I have decided to recuse myself from any existing or future investigations of any matters related in any way to the campaigns for President of the United States.”His recusal came after he admitted that during his confirmation hearings, he did not disclose contacts he’d had with the Russian ambassador last year. The FBI is leading an investigation into the role the Russian government had in the 2016 election, and the next director will, therefore, have a heavy hand in the probe. Sessions was also involved in the decision to fire James Comey from the job. The New York Times reported that senior White House and Justice Department officials “had been working on building a case” against Comey, and “Sessions had been charged with coming up with reasons to fire him.”Trump has admitted that he weighed the FBI’s Russia investigation when he decided to fire Comey ― despite his administration’s insistence initially that Comey’s dismissal was all about how he handled the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Sunday that he has asked the Justice Department’s inspector general to look into Sessions on this issue.“The request I have made is not only to look into any interference to thwart the investigation, but whether Attorney General Sessions should have participated in the firing of Comey and should participate in [selecting an] FBI director,” he told CNN. “You know, Attorney General Sessions has a much higher obligation. He didn’t tell the truth about meeting with the Russians, so he recused himself. Now he seems to be violating that recusal. That would seem, on its face, to be part of this.”Stephen Gillers, a New York University School of Law professor specializing in legal ethics, said Sessions should not have been involved in Comey’s firing. But, he said, he could have a limited role in picking his successor. “[I]nterviews of candidates may include discussion of their views of the Russia investigation ― how to do it, whether there should be a special prosecutor, perhaps immunity questions and timing ― and Sessions must have no role in and no inside knowledge of those conversations,” Gillers said. “This is not a perfect solution, however, because Trump, not Sessions, chooses the FBI director. While Trump should limit any questions he may have to a candidate’s experience and general views about the Bureau and law enforcement ethos and priorities, we may not know if he asks more pointed questions.”“Of course, a nominee can be asked about that at the confirmation hearings. All of this is complicated by the fact that Sessions has already reneged on his recusal promise to the Senate,” he added.Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein reportedly interviewed eight FBI director candidates over the weekend.Want more updates from Amanda Terkel?

24,POLITICS,Tricky Position For GOP Candidates As Health Care Repeal Heads To The Senate,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/health-care-repeal-gop-senate_us_5918cdf0e4b00f308cf61f0d,GOP Senate candidates may be at odds with the positions of the GOP senators from their states.,2017-05-15,Rep. Pat Tiberi (R-Ohio) voted for the AHCA and is weighing a Senate bid in 2018.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5918e4d11600002000c5b2e0.jpeg?ops=crop_0_371_4672_2635%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Senators return to Washington Monday, with health care repeal now squarely in their laps after House Republicans managed to come up with a bill that a majority of their majority was willing to support ― or at least willing to vote for to make it all the Senate’s problem.Many GOP senators have already expressed reservations about the American Health Care Act, making it clear it will go through significant changes if it ever reaches President Donald Trump’s desk.“I’ve already made clear that I don’t support the House bill as currently constructed because I continue to have concerns that this bill does not do enough to protect Ohio’s Medicaid expansion population, especially those who are receiving treatment for heroin and prescription drug abuse,” Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) said after the bill passed on May 4.Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) has also said there could be “tragic consequences” if Medicaid expansion goes away, particularly on the issue of opioid funding. But the House GOP bill would slash federal spending on Medicaid and wind down the expansion that was enacted under Obamacare ― and that 31 states plus the District of Columbia took advantage of. The AHCA has put a handful of House GOP members considering running for Senate in 2018 in a tricky spot: They need to back repeal, because that’s the party line and it’s what they’ve been promising for years. But they now may also be at odds with what the GOP senators from their state are saying.Ohio is a prime example. Portman is denouncing the House bill for which Rep. Pat Tiberi (R-Ohio) ― who is reportedly weighing a challenge to Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) ― voted. He has justified voting for the measure by claiming that cuts to the program will ultimately save the program. “Right now, Medicaid is on a fiscal path that is unsustainable,” Tiberi spokeswoman Olivia Hnat told The Columbus Dispatch. “On its current track, in 10 years, Medicaid will cost $1 trillion every single year. This is not only a budget issue; it is a moral one. In the American Health Care Act, we aim to put this program on stronger financial footing so that it is available for our must-vulnerable patients and those in need over the long term.”Rep. Evan Jenkins (R-W.Va.), who is running in 2018 against Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), along with Reps. David McKinley (R-W.Va.) and Alex Mooney (R-W.Va.), who are considering running, are in similar positions. All three voted for the AHCA and praised it, while Capito continues to say she is “concerned” about rolling back the Medicaid expansion.“I’ve seen a lot of benefits to the Medicaid expansion in our state, particularly in the mental health and opioid and drug abuse area,” Capito said recently. “I think we need to make sure these folks have access permanently, either under this or some other kind of way. But we can’t just drop them off and wish them good luck.”McKinley, however, told West Virginia Public Broadcasting that he was comfortable with the AHCA’s protections: “It’s disingenuous for anyone to suggest that we’re not going to have adequate money for Medicaid for people on drug overdose problems. We’re going to have that.”Similar dynamics could play out in Pennsylvania, Indiana and Missouri ― all places where House members considering Senate runs voted for the AHCA and where senators are sounding more cautious about the bill. In other words, the concerns of Senate Republicans could be pitted against the votes and positions taken by Senate GOP candidates in the 2018 cycle if the two chambers don’t come to some sort of agreement.The National Republican Senatorial Committee didn’t return a request for comment, but the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee said Republicans were “caught between a rock and a hard place.”“[B]ut it’s nothing compared to the challenges facing hardworking Americans who will see their coverage slashed and costs spiked under the GOP healthcare platform,” DSCC spokesman David Bergstein said. “Every Republican Senate candidate will be held accountable for their Party’s toxic healthcare plan, and they’ll have to answer for the criticism their proposals have generated from Americans of every political persuasion.”It’s widely expected that the Senate will not accept the more controversial provisions in the AHCA and will insist on changes to the Medicaid provisions, for example. But that doesn’t necessarily mean a repeal bill is doomed. Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), chairman of the far-right House Freedom Caucus, is already working with Senate Republicans on what alterations his members could live with and how they could get a bill to Trump’s desk.Want more updates from Amanda Terkel?

25,POLITICS,Potential 2020 Candidates Are Already Spending Big On Online Ads. Here's Why.,Sam Stein and Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/2020-democrats-spending_us_5919df4ce4b0809be156da65,“It would be foolish for us not to tap into that outlet.”,2017-05-15,Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is raising huge sums from online grassroots donors at an early stage in the 2018 election cycle.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5919eb6d1500001f00db2682.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Having won office just seven months ago, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) won’t face re-election for another 2,000 days or so. But already, she is spending massive amounts of money on digital advertising from her campaign account. The nearly $300,000 she’s spent on those digital ads in the first three months of 2017 has sparked private speculation about whether the freshman senator is in fact prepping for a different sort of race. A fast-rising star within the party, Harris is often included on shortlists for possible presidential candidates in 2020. That she’s essentially investing in email acquisition and brand-building only further suggests interest in a White House bid.A Harris strategist, speaking on condition of anonymity, insisted that the presidency is “not the motivation” for her digital expenditures. Rather, the strategist said, Harris is simply looking to shore up her finances. The atmosphere of activist energy permeating Democratic politics during the turbulent early days of the Trump administration has given Harris’ team an opportunity to dramatically upend their traditional fundraising structure.“I had never seen anything like it,” said the strategist. “This may be a once-in-a-lifetime moment from the standpoint of not just the short-term opportunity to raise money, but how we increase our reach... The opportunity is there to get out of the traditional fundraising rat race and to make a direct appeal to donors on a widely distributed small-dollar basis. And obviously we are building our online fundraising capacity because now, for the first time in Harris’ career, we have an opportunity to scale it up.”Harris’ team is not wrong. This is a golden age of Democratic online organizing. According to experts, the wave of anti-Donald Trump sentiment may represent a rare opportunity for lawmakers to shift away from a reliance on big-money donors and toward a system popularized by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) during his presidential run: small-dollar giving that begets sustained forms of activism.“When you stack it up against other ways to raise money, it has the advantage that when you’re fundraising, you’re also mobilizing a base that you can use for other actions,” Michael Malbin, the head of the Campaign Finance Institute, told HuffPost. “The important thing is that these are people who might not only vote for them, but might recommend them to other people.”Campaign fundraisers say the deluge of money currently coming in online is unlike anything the party has ever seen in the first quarter following a presidential election. More than one operative described investments in digital advertising as “free money,” and as a chance for someone with an eye on the White House to build a foundation for that campaign.The Harris strategist said the senator received nearly 48,000 individual contributions in the first three months of 2017, with an average donation of just under $18.50 ― Sanders-like numbers. They also calculated that they were getting a 700 percent return on investment for every dollar spent on digital (though a industry source said that, after retainers, that figure was likely closer to 300-400 percent). Partly as a result of her online ad spending, Harris raised $738,459 from small donors giving less than $200 from January through March. Other Democratic stalwarts are making similar digital expenditures at a very early stage this cycle ― and finding similar levels of success. Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) are all up for re-election in 2018, and all are on 2020 presidential candidate shortlists. Each of them spent huge sums on digital ads and consultants in the first three months of 2017. Gillibrand has spent the most, with nearly $500,000 flowing to Anne Lewis Strategies for online consulting. This has helped her rake in close $1.5 million in the first three months of the year. Both of those figures are radically higher than the last time she ran for election in 2012. Back in the first three months of 2011, Gillibrand spent less than $50,000 on her online consultants and raised just $101,288 from small donors.“She is up in ’18,” said a Gillibrand aide. “We don’t know what kind of race we are going to have yet. You could always get a self-funder who decides they want to spend $15-40 million to go buy a Senate seat. So we are going to actively raise all the resources we need to be competitive regardless of the situation we are in.”Murphy, who like Gillibrand is running for his second term, spent $391,000 on digital advertising in the first three months of 2017 and raised over $1 million from small donors. In 2011, he spent less than $10,000 on online consultants and raised $55,995 from small donors over the same period of time.“Senator Murphy is working hard to lay the groundwork for his re-election campaign next year,” said Murphy’s aide, Chris Harris.Warren, also up for her second term, spent $262,787 on digital ads and consultants in the first quarter of 2017. A star in the party, Warren came into 2017 with a built-in small-donor constituency. That helped her raise a stunning $3.2 million from small donors in the first three months of the year ― a 1200 percent return on investment. Her $3.2 million small-donor haul in the first three months of a non-election year is close to the amount she raised from small donors during the summer and fall months leading up to her 2012 election.“In 2012, we built what at the time was the largest grassroots fundraising campaign, and we are making similar investments in digital ahead of the re-election, especially because engagement online is so ridiculous right now,” said a Warren aide. “It would be foolish for us not to tap into that outlet.”Unlike Warren, Gillibrand and Murphy, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) ― another name often heard in discussions about Democratic White House hopefuls ― is not up for re-election in 2018. His term expires in 2020. Booker’s digital ad expenditures are modest compared to those of his colleagues. But the $83,500 he has spent in the first three months of 2017 has still helped him raise $289,757 from small donors ― and invites questions about why someone who won’t face voters for another three years is spending that money at all.

Kamala Harris (D-Ca.) had a timely message for Howard University graduates stepping into post-college life in the Trump era.The senator, who graduated from the historically black college in 1986, told students at the school’s commencement in Washington, D.C., on Saturday that they are graduating at a unique time in this country’s history. Citing policies that affect mass incarceration, immigration and health care under leaders “we no longer believe the words of,” Harris told the Class of 2017, “indeed we have a fight ahead.”“And it’s a fight to determine whether we are willing to stand up for our deepest values,” she said. “Because let’s be clear — we are better than this.”She urged students to realize there’s no limit to the impact they can have when they reject the “false choices” placed upon them.“The reality is on most matters, somebody is going to make the decision — so why not let it be you?” she said. “Because, if we’re going to make progress anywhere, we need you everywhere. And, sometimes to make change you’ve got to change how change is made.”Harris also invoked Howard’s motto ― “Veritas et Utilitas,” meaning “Truth and Service” ― to deliver her point of how the graduates can make a difference. The senator insisted that the graduates speak out, “even when it’s uncomfortable or inconvenient.”She shared an anecdote about her time as a prosecutor during the 1990s crack epidemic, when she admonished co-workers who were ready to criminalize certain people based on where they lived, how they dressed and the kind of music they listened to. Harris told the graduates that they would be in similar situations and they may be the only one in the room who looks like them, but they should never remain silent and instead let their alma mater’s motto be their guiding principle: “At a time when there are Americans — disproportionately black and brown men — trapped in a broken system of mass incarceration ... speak truth — and serve. At a time when men, women and children have been detained at airports in our country simply because of the God they worship … speak truth — and serve. At a time when immigrants have been taken from their families in front of schools and outside courthouses … speak truth — and serve. And at a time of incredible scientific and technological advances as well … when we’re dreaming of a mission to Mars … and unraveling the mysteries of the brain … and entrepreneurs in my home state of California are even starting to test flying cars ... speak truth — and serve.Watch a clip from Harris’ speech below.

The law dates back to the island’s colonial period and makes no mention of lesbians.(Reporting by Fathin Ungku; Editing by Miyoung Kim and Clarence Fernandez)"

The publication did not elaborate on what the president’s disclosure entailed, due to its sensitive nature, but said the information came from a U.S. ally.BuzzFeed later confirmed the report, adding that the Senate Intelligence Committee was also briefed on the disclosures. “It’s far worse than what has already been reported,” one official reportedly told the outlet.(Several Senate Intelligence Committee members told NPR’s Scott Detrow they had not been briefed on the disclosure.)A White House spokeswoman did not immediately return a request for comment on whether Trump shared classified information with the Russian officials. However, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in a statement that Trump did not discuss sources, methods or military operations with Lavrov.H.R. McMaster, Trump’s national security adviser, also disputed the report.Read the full Washington Post report here. Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers immediately voiced concern over the apparent intelligence disclosures.“We have no way to know what was said, but protecting our nation’s secrets is paramount,” a spokesman for House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said in a statement. “The speaker hopes for a full explanation of the facts from the administration.”“If it’s true, I would say it’s disturbing,” Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told CNN Monday evening. But McCain also told The Associated Press that Trump was within his rights to share the information. “If true, this is a slap in the face to the intel community. Risking sources & methods is inexcusable, particularly with the Russians,” said Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee.“Obviously they’re in a downward spiral right now and they’ve got to figure out a way to come to grips with all that’s happening,” Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters Monday.Sen. Pat Leahy (D-Vt.) called the disclosure, if confirmed to be true, “almost inconceivable.”“We’re in ‘Alice in Wonderland’ territory here,” he said in a Monday evening interview on CNN.“Our allies, if they tell us that information, they assume we’ll never relate that,” he added of the classified intelligence Trump reportedly shared with Russian officials. “It would be almost inconceivable that any president would allow something of that nature out.”Leahy acknowledged that the president has the authority to declassify information as he sees fit but that doing so and sharing it with the Russians would put America at risk.“There is no way in God’s green earth you can say that makes us safer. It does not,” he said.Trump had already received abundant criticism for the meeting in the Oval Office ― including disapproval that it happened one day after he fired FBI Director James Comey, who had been investigating his administration’s alleged ties to Russia. Trump was also attacked for allowing a photographer for the Russian state news agency TASS to cover the meeting, which American media had been barred from attending. The White House said it had been misled, but the Russian photographers’ access to the Oval Office sparked questions about a possible security breach. “Deadly serious Q: Was it a good idea to let a Russian gov photographer & all their equipment into the Oval Office?” tweeted Colin Kahl, deputy national security adviser to former Vice President Joe Biden. While the president has the power to declassify virtually any information, some considered the allegation that Trump revealed highly classified information ironic, given the president’s own war on leaks. He’s accused individuals who have revealed damaging information about him to the press of being “un-American” and of acting “just like Russia.” He’s also called on the Justice Department to investigate “criminal leaks” and accused former President Barack Obama, without any evidence, of leaking information.And throughout the presidential campaign, Trump frequently criticized his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, for using a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state, which had raised concerns over her handling of classified information. He went so far as to pledge to prosecute Clinton if he won, a promise he quickly dropped after the election.Monday’s report is the latest in a series of revelations detailing Trump’s unpredictable style while interacting with foreign counterparts.In a span of one week in January, the president hung up on Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull after attacking a plan to resettle refugees in the U.S. as “the worst deal ever.” The day before, he had a testy diplomatic call with Enrique Peña Nieto, in which Trump reportedly told the Mexican president he was ready to send U.S. troops to stop “bad hombres down there” if the Mexican military didn’t step up. Later that week, Trump also picked a fight with Iran on Twitter: “Iran has been formally PUT ON NOTICE for firing a ballistic missile. Should have been thankful for the terrible deal the U.S. made with them!”Those unscripted responses, in some cases even when dealing with longtime U.S. allies, have raised questions in foreign capitals about how reliable an ally the U.S. might be under Trump.Experts have raised concerns that a lack of confidence in U.S. leadership may jeopardize cooperation in the fight against the self-described Islamic State, also known as ISIS, at a critical time in the fight against the militant group.Last week, the Trump administration confirmed the U.S. would start arming Kurdish YPG fighters to support their planned assault on Raqqa, ISIS’ stronghold in Syria.The decision drew fierce condemnation from Turkey, which views the YPG militia as the Syrian extension of the Kurdish PKK militant group, which Ankara has battled since 1984.Trump is set to meet Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday at the White House.Igor Bobic contributed reporting.This is a developing story and has been updated with more reactions and information on classified disclosures and foreign policy concerns."

After The New York Times published audio of the call, Gianforte walked back his comments, suggesting last week that he would have voted against the bill. The ad cuts together clips of local TV news reports about Gianforte’s changing stance on the bill, along with ominous piano music. The ad is running statewide ahead of the May 25 special election to fill the House seat vacated by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. The campaign to elect Democrat Rob Quist, a musician and ranchers’ son running on a populist platform, paid for the ad. “Gianforte said he was thankful for a bill that takes away protections for pre-existing conditions and raises premiums,” says the ad’s narrator. “Thankful, because he got a huge tax break in return.” Less than one-third of the American public favors the health care bill, according to a HuffPost/YouGov survey published last week. A Fox News poll found similar results.Quist has attracted political star power of his own. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) plans to barnstorm Montana the weekend before the election alongside Quist, who backed Sanders’ insurgent campaign against Hillary Clinton in the Democratic presidential primary last year.

Islamic State is expected to make a last stand around the Old City’s Grand al-Nuri Mosque, where the Islamist group’s black flag has been flying since June 2014.Backed by U.S.-led coalition air strikes and advisers, Iraqi forces have made rapid gains since opening a new front in the northwest of Mosul earlier this month, closing in on the Old City.Outnumbered, militants have retaliated with suicide car bombs and snipers embedded among the hundreds of thousands of civilians trapped in west Mosul. Many local people have been killed by militants or heavy bombardments.“If we advance this quickly we can finish it in days,” First Lieutenant Nawfal al-Dhari told Reuters at a house turned into a temporary base in the western Islah al-Ziraie district, retaken by Iraqi forces three days ago.“These are their dying breaths. They are completely surrounded.”He said the momentum was with Iraq’s elite Counter Terrorism Service (CTS), the U.S.-trained special forces who have led the campaign to retake the country’s second city, despite continued resistance from Islamic State fighters.“If you trap a cat in a room, it will scratch,” he said.Retaking the mosque, where Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in 2014 declared a “caliphate” spanning swathes of Syria and Iraq, would be both a symbolic and strategic victory.Military commanders and intelligence officials say they aim to take control of al-Nuri mosque before Ramadan starts at the end of this month so they can declare the battle won, even if the militants continue to hold out in pockets.They said the number of Islamic State militants still fighting was shrinking, and they were increasingly disorganized and short of arms, ammunition and equipment following months of siege.DEATH TRAP“Daesh are losing the ability to fight back. It’s obvious they are blundering. We want to make the Old City a closed death casket for Daesh,” an Iraqi army intelligence colonel said, using an Arabic term for Islamic State.“Yes there will be remnants of Daesh inside the Old City, but it will be as easy as hunting rabbits to take them down.”The warren of densely packed houses and alleys, with Roman, Ottoman and Persian traces, has proved a complex battleground for Iraqi troops against a skilled enemy willing to use civilians as shields.Iraqi forces have tried to open up several fronts in an attempt to split Islamic State militants, who have had two years to prepare their defenses.U.S.-backed air strikes in the tightly-packed neighborhoods have been made more difficult, government forces say, by their efforts to avoid civilian casualties.The Iraqi government said last week the number of people fleeing Mosul had more than doubled to about 10,000 a day.“Our advance on a vast front has stunned the enemy and, God willing, we will achieve victory before Ramadan and announce the liberation of Mosul and people of Mosul from the dirtiness of Daesh,” Lieutenant General Othman al-Ghanmi, chief of staff, said in a video distributed by the Defence Ministry.He was speaking on a visit to the front lines in western Mosul.

Islamic State is expected to make a last stand around the Old City’s Grand al-Nuri Mosque, where the Islamist group’s black flag has been flying since June 2014.Backed by U.S.-led coalition air strikes and advisers, Iraqi forces have made rapid gains since opening a new front in the northwest of Mosul earlier this month, closing in on the Old City.Outnumbered, militants have retaliated with suicide car bombs and snipers embedded among the hundreds of thousands of civilians trapped in west Mosul. Many local people have been killed by militants or heavy bombardments.“If we advance this quickly we can finish it in days,” First Lieutenant Nawfal al-Dhari told Reuters at a house turned into a temporary base in the western Islah al-Ziraie district, retaken by Iraqi forces three days ago.“These are their dying breaths. They are completely surrounded.”He said the momentum was with Iraq’s elite Counter Terrorism Service (CTS), the U.S.-trained special forces who have led the campaign to retake the country’s second city, despite continued resistance from Islamic State fighters.“If you trap a cat in a room, it will scratch,” he said.Retaking the mosque, where Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in 2014 declared a “caliphate” spanning swathes of Syria and Iraq, would be both a symbolic and strategic victory.Military commanders and intelligence officials say they aim to take control of al-Nuri mosque before Ramadan starts at the end of this month so they can declare the battle won, even if the militants continue to hold out in pockets.They said the number of Islamic State militants still fighting was shrinking, and they were increasingly disorganized and short of arms, ammunition and equipment following months of siege.DEATH TRAP“Daesh are losing the ability to fight back. It’s obvious they are blundering. We want to make the Old City a closed death casket for Daesh,” an Iraqi army intelligence colonel said, using an Arabic term for Islamic State.“Yes there will be remnants of Daesh inside the Old City, but it will be as easy as hunting rabbits to take them down.”The warren of densely packed houses and alleys, with Roman, Ottoman and Persian traces, has proved a complex battleground for Iraqi troops against a skilled enemy willing to use civilians as shields.Iraqi forces have tried to open up several fronts in an attempt to split Islamic State militants, who have had two years to prepare their defenses.U.S.-backed air strikes in the tightly-packed neighborhoods have been made more difficult, government forces say, by their efforts to avoid civilian casualties.The Iraqi government said last week the number of people fleeing Mosul had more than doubled to about 10,000 a day.“Our advance on a vast front has stunned the enemy and, God willing, we will achieve victory before Ramadan and announce the liberation of Mosul and people of Mosul from the dirtiness of Daesh,” Lieutenant General Othman al-Ghanmi, chief of staff, said in a video distributed by the Defence Ministry.He was speaking on a visit to the front lines in western Mosul.

The “Saturday Night Live” regular has revealed in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter that an unnamed cabinet member told him at a New York City restaurant that his impression of the president was spot-on. “I’m not going to name names, but a cabinet member walked up to me at a restaurant in Manhattan — Manhattan, that’s a hint — and he goes, ‘I gotta tell you something. This thing you’re doing is good, it’s really good,’” Baldwin said.“He goes, ‘I’ll get fired if anybody quoted me saying this, but that’s exactly what he’s like when you do it,’” Baldwin continued.That the cabinet member would not want to be quoted makes sense, given that the show’s depiction of Trump’s White House as a bumbling pile of incompetence has reportedly made the president furious on multiple occasions.If Trump were to find out someone in his cabinet complimented Baldwin’s impression, it would not be hard to imagine it causing a ruckus ― especially considering it has led to the show’s highest-rated season in two decades. As a complete non sequitur, we will now note for no reason whatsoever that Gary Cohn and Wilbur Ross, two prominent members of the Trump administration, both have longstanding ties to the island of Manhattan."

The Washington Post is withholding most plot details, including the name of the city, at the urging of officials who warned that revealing them would jeopardize important intelligence capabilities.According to the Post, details Trump gave to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak had been provided by a U.S. partner, and were “so sensitive” that they’d been “withheld from allies and tightly restricted even within the U.S. government.” The Post reported that Trump’s disclosure risks future cooperation with the unnamed U.S. partner, which hadn’t given permission to share the information. The Post proved to be “more effective at protecting classified information than President Trump in his exchanges with the Russians,” Ned Price, a former National Security Council spokesman, said on MSNBC Monday evening.Jim Roberts, a former editor at The New York Times and Mashable, said the paper acted “more responsibly” than the president. The New York Times and BuzzFeed separately confirmed that Trump revealed highly classified information to the Russians.The White House rejected the Post’s bombshell. National security adviser H.R. McMaster denounced the story and said, “at no time were sources or methods discussed” in the meeting. The Post story didn’t claim Trump disclosed sources and methods. Washington Post reporter Greg Miller said on CNN that the White House is “playing word games ... to try to blunt the impact of this story.” Miller said he “absolutely” stood by the reporting. Trump met with Lavrov and Kislyak the morning after firing FBI James Comey, who was overseeing the investigation into whether Trump campaign associates colluded with Russia during the 2016 election. The White House barred U.S. journalists from covering any part of the meeting, though permitted a photographer working for Lavrov and Russian state media inside the Oval Office. It’s unclear how much of the meeting was attended by the Russian photographer, who revealed Kislyak’s presence. The White House did not tell reporters of Kislyak’s appearance in an official readout of the meeting. "
34,IMPACT,Uniting Generations To Make Communities Stronger,"Donna M. Butts and Trent Stamp, Contributors",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/uniting-generations-to-make-communities-stronger_us_591a0582e4b0f31b03fb9e18,"In a recent Generations United/The Eisner Foundation nationwide survey conducted online by Harris Poll*, more than half of",2017-05-15,<p>Kids and elders grow fruits and vegetables together at a preschool in San Diego County.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591a0e8d1e00001800623207.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In a recent Generations United/The Eisner Foundation nationwide survey conducted online by Harris Poll*, more than half of the respondents said that few of the people they regularly spend time with are much older or much younger than themselves. It wasn’t always this way. We once lived in multi-generational homes, in multi-generational communities. That was the norm. But as Americans began to recognize both children and elders as vulnerable populations that deserved public protection, schooling became compulsory, child labor was banned, and, thanks to Social Security and Medicare, retirement became a standard phase of life. And because of these changes, children and elders thrived as never before. But the changes also consigned both groups to isolation—not only from mainstream society, but from one another. Americans still believe that kids and older adults merit special treatment. Our survey shows that over 90% think that children, youth and elders are vulnerable populations that society must protect. But that protection should not equal isolation—and Americans believe that too. Over 90% of survey respondents said that older and younger generations mutually benefit from building relationships across generations. In fact, most adults in our survey—78 percent—are so convinced that the young and the old are good for one another that they want the federal government to play a role in fostering ties between them. And 77 percent of adults wish there were more opportunities in their own community for people from different age groups to meet and get to know one another. If integrating younger and older community members became not only a priority but a policy, it would be better for all of us. For one thing, when the generations don’t mix, it’s easy for them to see one another as rivals for scarce societal resources. By contrast, when people of all ages get to know one another, they tend instead to unite around shared goals. Additionally, fostering intergenerational connections can have significant implications for healthcare, infrastructure and education in the U.S. Health Care Nearly half of elders report feeling lonely at least occasionally, while 19 percent report frequent loneliness—and loneliness is linked to depression, cognitive decline, high blood pressure, and premature death. Through organizations like DOROT, this year’s recipient of the Eisner Prize for Intergenerational Excellence, isolated elders enjoy regular contact with energetic young people through meal delivery programs, visitation programs, homelessness prevention initiatives, teen internships and more. Older adults engaged in intergenerational programs like those at DOROT feel more optimistic and take better care of themselves. Coupled with a decrease in the health effects of loneliness, this decreases their need for medical attention and eases the burden on the healthcare system. Infrastructure When kids and elders are served at a single facility rather than at two separate ones, costs per client decline—saving taxpayers money. For example, at the St. Ann Center for Intergenerational Care in Milwaukee, preschoolers and older adults are served under the same roof. But the efficiency of a single location is just one of the benefits of this center—children and seniors interact throughout the day, creating connections and building friendships that they wouldn’t have otherwise. Intergenerational programs can also facilitate community improvements. A group from the Northland Foundation’s “AGE to age” initiative in Minnesota revitalized a blighted park in a small rural community. After thousands of volunteer hours from youth and seniors alike, “Generations Park,” as it has been renamed, is the crown jewel of the community, with a butterfly garden, a pavilion, picnic tables, and a farmer’s market. Creating infrastructure that benefits all generations means these investments go further. Education Beginning with the Foster Grandparents Program over 50 years ago, elders have long volunteered in schools. While we still need to make it easier and more common, others are now creating innovative avenues to connect generations in education settings. Take Ithaca College for example. A short walk or shuttle ride from the college, Longview retirement community buzzes with students. Musicians and dancers stage performances for residents; history and journalism majors benefit from their life stories. Gerontology students experience aging, while budding physical, occupational, and speech therapists help assess and treat their ailments. Meanwhile, Longview residents swim in the college’s pool, use its library, attend plays and other campus performances, and audit any courses they like. Dismantling age segregation won’t be easy; true social change never is. But success stories like these show us the potential of increased intergenerational connections in our society. When combined, the wisdom of our elders and the energy of our young can make our communities stronger. * Survey Methodology: The Generations United/Eisner Foundation survey was conducted online by Harris Poll February 15-17, 2017 among 2,171 U.S. adults ages 18 and older. This online survey is not based on a probability sample and therefore no estimate of theoretical sampling error can be calculated.

35,GREEN,States And Cities Can Save The Paris Pact,"William S. Becker, ContributorEnergy & Climate Policy Expert",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/states-cities-can-save-the-paris-pact_us_5919dfb7e4b03e1c81b00794,"There are influential, bipartisan and surprising allies urging President Donald Trump to keep the United States in the Paris",2017-05-15,<p>The Center for Climate and Energy Solution reports that 34 states and the District of Columbia already have climate action plans. </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591a0fd01e00001410623214.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There are influential, bipartisan and surprising allies urging President Donald Trump to keep the United States in the Paris climate agreement. They include some of the world’s biggest fossil energy companies, members of both parties in Congress, CEOs, governors, veterans, and farmers.But with Trump laying waste to President Obama’s climate policies, with his emasculation of the EPA and his plans to starve federal climate science, it is unclear what the U.S. government could add to the success of the Paris accord.In my previous post, I offered one idea to break the impasse between Trump’s advisors on whether the U.S. should remain in or pull out of the Paris agreement. First, the president would take a blood oath not to interfere with state and local climate action. Second, he would aggregate emission reduction commitments from states, cities and corporations to give substance to the U.S. role in the accord. Third, he would faithfully enforce any federal climate policies approved by Congress or upheld by the courts.On the first point, Trump already says he supports state rights. He reportedly told governors earlier this year that he wants states to craft their own policies — including environmental rules — without interference from the federal government.A test of his sincerity is on the horizon regarding fuel-efficiency standards for vehicles. The Administration is expected to roll back the historic CAFE standards put in place by the Obama Administration. Trump’s next likely concession to automakers would be to rescind EPA’s “California waiver,” which allows states to set tougher fuel efficiency standards than the federal government’s. If Trump really believes in states’ rights, he won’t do that.On the second point, the question is whether state, local and corporate commitments to reduce carbon emissions would be sufficient for the U.S. to make a meaningful contribution to achieving the Paris agreement’s goals. There is reason for optimism.States have the tools: States and cities have substantially more authority than the federal government to deal with carbon pollution. In addition to vehicle standards, they can regulate electric utilities; establish renewable energy and energy efficiency standards; reduce pollution with smart transportation and urban planning; offer tax incentives and financing for renewable energy investments; establish and enforce energy codes for buildings; regulate oil and gas production; and more.Since the late 1990s, nearly 30 states have implemented requirements for electric utilities to generate power from renewable resources. After Obama issued his climate action plan, 62 cities announced they intended to meet or exceed federal emission targets. Today, cities are setting clean energy goals that were unthinkable a decade ago. By the end of March, 25 U.S. cities had joined the growing ranks of municipalities that intend to obtain 100% of their electricity from clean renewable fuels.The Mayors National Climate Action Agenda, which includes the chief executives of 75 cities, has promised to “take every action possible to achieve the principles and goals of the Paris Climate Agreement and to engage states, businesses and other sectors to join us.” Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor who co-chairs the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, promises that American states, cities and businesses will fulfill the U.S. commitment to the Paris accord no matter what happens in Washington.Corporations pitch in: Earlier this month, 12 governors wrote to Trump that “U.S. companies recognize the need to address business risks and opportunities through the Paris Agreement...”Many of our largest corporations are making aggressive commitments to renewable energy and to leveraging similar commitments from their supply chains. As 2017 began, 71 Fortune 100 companies and 43 pecent of Fortune 500 companies had set sustainable or renewable energy targets; 22 have committed to 100 percent renewable power.The availability of low-carbon energy has become a factor in where these companies decide to locate. As one business association reports, “Retail and tech companies such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Target and Walmart are among nearly half of the Fortune 500 companies seeking to locate operations in states with ready access to clean-energy sources.”Many more localities will act: In addition to this opportunity for economic development, job creation and growing climate impacts will motivate more states and cities to act. One analysis published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that more than 300 U.S. cities with a combined population of 3.6 million are already at risk of flooding due to sea level rise. On the brighter side, the U.S. Department of Energy reports that jobs in solar and wind energy grew 25 percent and 32 percent respectively last year. Nearly 3 million Americans worked part- or full-time in energy efficiency, solar energy, wind energy and alternative vehicles, 14 times the number of people employed in fossil fuel jobs related to electricity production.Finally, in regard to the third element of a Trump Paris plan – carrying out mandates from Congress and the courts ― several states, cities and corporations are taking legal action to defend Obama’s progressive climate policies. Some of the policies are likely to survive. Trump would be obliged to implement them, optimally in a plan that combines federal efforts with those of cities, states and companies.Of course, the best development for the American people and the world at large would be a powerful ah-ha moment that triggers Trump’s realization that climate change is underway; that it is caused mostly by fossil energy emissions; that it is jeopardizing his real estate holdings and, by the way, the health and welfare of the American people; that it will result in unmanageable budget deficits at all levels of government; that avoiding climate change is right up there with avoiding nuclear war; and that nationalism cannot mitigate a global threat.Even better, the protesters we have seen lately would start dancing in the streets if Congress were to finally face reality and make aggressive climate action a requirement of law rather than a presidential prerogative.But since neither of those scenarios is likely just now, America’s best response to climate change will continue coming from outside Washington, D.C."

Among its primary victims was the United Kingdom’s National Health Service system, causing massive shutdowns and inconveniences to the country’s health care infrastructure. Though certainly not the only internationally scaled cybersecurity threat in recent years, this attack’s consequential impacts should serve as a stark reminder of the significant vulnerabilities within the intersection of technology and medicine.Accordingly, experts need to revisit a few areas of concern in the health care industry which may be conducive to increased cybersecurity threats in the coming years.Hospital/Health Care Systems The Department of Health and Human Service’s Office of Civil Rights, which oversees the enforcement of patient privacy laws such as HIPAA (Health Information Portability and Accountability Act), contends “that [the] personal health data of 30 million Americans has been compromised since 2009.” With the advent of electronic medical records and digital systems to store patient data, hospitals have become critically dependent on electronic media to provide patient care, and have thus become ripe targets for hackers which seek to extort or cripple large health care systems. Similar to the UK’s current crisis, extortionists often encrypt vital system and patient files, making it impossible to move forward with treatment or patient care. While some hackers cyber security seek payment prior to releasing the files, far larger concerns emerge when patient data itself is stolen, giving access to vital information about an individual’s health care records and overall biography. The potential misuse to this data is limitless, as medical records and specific patient files can fetch up to $500 to $1200 (per record) in unregulated forums.Medical DevicesRevolutionary innovations in health care such as pacemakers, insulin pumps, and other medical implant devices have made it easy for patients to seek personalized and convenient care. However, many of these devices have also become “smarter,” often allowing users to control them wirelessly or remotely. Though an incredible metric of convenience, the connective and digital abilities of these devices provide a perfect medium for cyber threats. While the hacking of less invasive devices such as smart contact lenses or wirelessly controlled hearing aids may not raise immediate concern, the threat and level of danger is as imminent for more sensitive and life-sustaining equipment, such as insulin pumps and even modern pacemakers. Many of the wireless features on these critical devices were originally created in order to give physicians real-time patient data and metrics. For example, a “smart” pacemaker can provide a physician with deeper insight into the patient’s cardiac data and even the device’s own efficacy. However, these digital features create vulnerabilities, allowing room for savvy intruders to take control of the systems remotely and cause potentially life-threatening changes.This problem will only be further compounded as the economy surrounding the “internet of things” continues to grow—a consumer trend that is expected to reach nearly $117 billion in market share by 2020. Fitbits, smart watches, activity trackers, and other health care “wearables” are constantly tracking and collecting data from the individual donning the device, which may likely also become of critical interest to cyber criminals. Ultimately, though many of these devices have considerably augmented individual health outcomes, their digital capabilities lend an open door for cyber threats.SolutionsThe health care industry needs to rise to the challenge and address the evolving landscape of cyber threats. Large hospitals and health care systems need to be more privy to security measures, specifically ensuring that the systems they are utilizing for storing patient data are frequently updated, and any system vulnerabilities are immediately addressed. Furthermore, guidance and training on detecting cyber threats should be provided to medical staff and employees, as they are often the first points of contact for digital threats. As for medical devices, manufacturers should take the necessary steps to ensure that their devices comport with standard compliance guidelines, and provide regular security updates and patches for the continued efficacy of their products.Finally, the most vital solution is to increase the attention and emphasis given to this critical issue. While the majority of the health care security debate is still stuck on HIPAA compliance, the digital revolution has brought forth many more imminent threats to patient safety. Accordingly, health care cybersecurity spending is expected to reach nearly $65 billion by 2021. Given that the digitization of health care and the industry’s reliance on information technology systems is unavoidable, research, development, and support for cybersecurity must be provided, congruent to the growing digital health ecosystem. Ultimately, while there is much to be gained from this revolutionary ecosystem, it brings with it the need for an unprecedented level of vigilance."

At a time when governments are failing to meet their climate-related promises and President Trump is threatening to leave the Paris Agreement, we can’t afford to stand-by waiting for our governments to do the right thing.Climate impacts are taking us into uncharted territory in terms of floods, forest fires, heatwaves, storms, and drought. We know that it is investments in the fossil fuel industry that fund climate impacts. That is why campaigners, faith groups, academics and impacted local communities came together to build on the fossil fuel divestment movement, which is now spreading in Asia, Latin America and Africa, setting the groundwork for future divestments.Divestment has proven to be an effective way to undermine the power of the fossil fuel industry both politically and financially. Global commitments to divest have already reached 710 institutions across 76 countries, representing well over US$5.5 trillion in assets under management, indicating that the fossil fuel industry has no future.During the GDM citizens and respected institutions across the world were able to enact an immediate and a much needed transformational form of climate leadership. This included the announcement from nine Catholic organizations from around the world about their decision to divest their portfolios from fossil fuels in the largest joint Catholic divestment to date. A total of 27 Catholic institutions have now divested. Meanwhile, in Brazil, over 3000 people participated in prayers in a vigil outside the Umuarama Cathedral, to voice their hopes for a fossil fuel free future.Other faith groups also took a moral stand and committed to divest including over a quarter of Quaker meetings in Britain, and a group of 30 clergy ― including three Church of England bishops ― sent an open letter to the Church of England Pensions Board, asking them to divest from fossil fuel companies and to invest in renewable alternatives.Across Europe, the links between municipalities and fossil fuel companies came under scrutiny. Over 1,000 people marched in Munich, Germany and demonstrations took place across the UK including rallies at 14 Town Halls across London demanding divestment. Campaigners also put pressure on universities pension funds, faith, health and cultural institutions such as the Louvre in Paris, the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam and the British Museum.The battle to safeguard people and planet is linked worldwide, the money in one part of the world is linked to infrastructure projects being built elsewhere. Hundreds of people gathered in Jakarta to listen to community representatives from Indramayu about their struggles living near coal power plant, while activists in Japan attended events targeting Japanese banks that invest in similar coal projects in the region. In New Zealand and Australia, campaigners targeted Australian coal giant Adani by calling on the banks that invest in it, including CommBank to stop its funding. Australia’s Great Barrier Reef has suffered a large bleaching for the second year in a row. Any mining expansion would jeopardize it even further.In the Netherlands, teachers, scientists and civil servants confronted the national pension fund ABP that continues to invest their pension savings in fossil fuels. While other activists in the UK demanded that Barclays divest from fracking.Meanwhile, in New York, 150 activists rallied inside Trump Tower, to call on New York City officials to cut their ties with the dirty oil and gas companies that control the White House. In the face of federal government climate denial and the possibility of the US leaving the Paris Agreement, demonstrating that local leaders can show impactful climate leadership, while other parts of the country are suffering from severe flooding.Students and academics led the way with creative actions, including activities at the Universidad de San Martín, Argentina; Universidad Católica Boliviana, Bolivia;  Stellenbosch University and University Cape Town in South Africa; Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University in Nigeria. French and Flemish speaking students at six universities in Belgium released a joint open letter calling on their institutions to stop investments in fossil fuels.Divestment also provides the means to enact a just transition by reinvesting into renewable energy systems. This was discussed at events held across Africa at universities and local communities, where the fossil fuel industry and its culpability in climate change were discussed along with clean energy solutions, in the face of some of the worst droughts the continent has ever suffered.The future is in the reinvestment of the divested funds to support the communities most impacted by climate change and the dirty energy-based economy. The divestment movement is modeling what governments need to be doing: withdrawing funds from the problem and investing in solutions.We urgently need this transformation in the global energy system, away from the fossil fuel dependence that drives climate change, and into renewable energy solutions for all. That’s why our governments, universities, religious organizations, cultural institutions, individuals, and others, must divest and cut ties with this rogue industry in order to curb the worst of future impacts of climate change. Moving forward through 2017 and beyond with their support, the divestment movement will continue to grow in size."

Skyline Landfill in Ferris, Texas, U.S., on Monday, Oct. 24, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5919a36d1500002000db2565.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Trump administration’s relentless march to repeal federal regulations is not limited to environmental rules, but the environment is a real target. The shame of these attacks is that rather than seeking to improve and refine our approach to environmental protection, we see a destructive effort at dismantling the structure of environmental law. The attack thus far has focused on Obama-era executive orders, since those are easier to change than rules issued by EPA, sometimes under court order, to implement specific statutory requirements. Writing in the New York Times last week, environmental journalist Coral Davenport reported that:…the Senate voted on Wednesday to uphold an Obama-era climate change regulation to control the release of methane from oil and gas wells on public land. Senators voted 51 to 49 to block consideration of a resolution to repeal the 2016 Interior Department rule to curb emissions of methane, a powerful planet-warming greenhouse gas. Senators John McCain of Arizona, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Susan Collins of Maine, all Republicans who have expressed concern about climate change and backed legislation to tackle the issue, broke with their party to join Democrats and defeat the resolution.The problem with U.S. national environmental law is that, with very few exceptions, it was enacted in the 1970s and 1980s and has not really been updated since then. The laws have been incredibly successful in cleaning our air, land and water, but that does not mean new threats have not emerged, or old threats could not reappear. Our technology continues to advance, our population and economy continues to grow, and environmental protection requires constant vigilance. A constructive and creative effort to update environmental law is long overdue, but this is not the time or place to undertake such a task.The crowd running the country these days could care less. They take for granted the clean air and clean water that America worked hard to achieve in the second half of the twentieth century. Trump’s real estate and branding empire has benefited enormously from the work of thousands of dedicated environmental activists and regulators. While I see little hope of modernizing the environmental regulatory structure under the current regime, last week provided some hope that the U.S. Senate won’t allow our environmental laws to be dismantled.Although state laws provide another critical layer of environmental protection, airsheds do not recognize state boundaries, and pollution prohibited by one state can easily blow in from an adjoining state. In fact, Senator McCain’s vote was partially explained by his concern that dirty air from New Mexico could pollute the air in Arizona. My hope is that state and local environmental concerns can counter the anti-regulatory zeal of the extreme right. As Pew reports in its most recent survey of environmental attitudes:…about three-quarters of U.S. adults (74%) said “the country should do whatever it takes to protect the environment,” compared with 23% who said “the country has gone too far in its efforts to protect the environment.But the survey also indicates growing partisanship on environmental regulation. Nearly 60 percent of Republicans think that environmental regulation reduces economic growth and employment. Before the Great Recession only 34% of Republicans held that factually inaccurate view. Conservative ideology may argue that environmental regulation costs jobs, but the opposite is true. Environmental protection is a “product line” that stimulates growth and employment. People will pay for clean air and water, and the technology that cleans air and water adds to the GDP. While conservative ideology is anti-regulation, the environment is so important to health that even these folks favor the government doing “whatever is needed” to protect the air, water and land. But the Pew study worries that people are inconsistent in their support of environmental protection. The study notes that the environment doesn’t rank as high as other issues and that many people don’t live “environmental lifestyles”.My view is that America’s environmental attitudes and values are quite consistent and the Pew analysts are misreading how the environment works as a policy issue and lifestyle choice. As a policy issue, the environment always has tremendous latent power. The public knows that the air and water are cleaner than they used to be. If people believed the environment was getting worse, it would move up on their public policy issue priority list. High ranking on policy issues results from a combination of the issue’s importance and government’s progress in addressing the issue. For example, crime in New York City used to be the number one local policy issue, but today it’s far down the list. If the crime rate spiked upward, however, it would quickly move up the issue ranking list. People know that the NYPD is hard at work and don’t think they need to worry about the issue. As for lifestyle choices, people like modern conveniences and will not give them up. Moreover, they have learned that advances in technology can improve environmental quality and their own behavior is less important than the use of those technologies. Their new air conditioner, refrigerator and light bulbs use less energy than the old ones did; Apple will buy back their old iPhones; today’s cars pollute less than yesterday’s clunkers. But the traditional environmentalist view is that to protect the environment we must reduce consumption. My view is that consumption must change, but that we can grow our economy while doing a better job of managing environmental impacts.There is a great deal of concern in the environmental community that the Trump Administration will damage the nation’s environment. I share that concern. The administration’s denial of basic climate science and willingness to tolerate pollution from extraction industries is a cause for alarm. The likelihood of environmental disasters will increase and public mobilization will take place in response to environmental destruction. We saw this in 1983 when then President Ronald Regan abandoned his original environmental team and brought back the original EPA administrator, William Ruckelshaus. We saw public mobilization after the BP oil spill, the VW emission scandal, and the lead water crisis in Flint. Visible, dangerous pollution crises bring out the environmentalist in all of us. As I often say, “people really like to breathe.”While EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt understands the regulatory process, the slow pace of assembling his team has made it difficult to rapidly dismantle environmental rules. I don’t believe that Pruitt and Trump want to completely deregulate the environment. It would be an enormous undertaking and even a more skilled and experienced set of government officials would have difficulty reengineering the entire federal environmental regulatory structure. There is now nearly a half century of law and case precedent in place. Any fundamental change in the legal structure would require action by Congress. The current Congress can’t even enact the health care reform they ran on, and the reaction to deregulating the environment would be fierce and intense. Any revision of environmental law would need to go through the same senate, which last week voted to maintain methane regulation.From my perspective, the problem with all of this is that we are working so hard to simply stand still. We need to learn more about the planet and our impact on it if we are to manage those impacts. We need to develop new technologies to make the transition from our throw-away economy to a sustainable and renewable one. Our race against time to address the climate crisis needs a fully engaged U.S. government. Instead, these next several years will see the U.S. federal government opposing the transition to a sustainable economy; this will harm the country and imperil the planet."

The CHRONIC Care Act, which includes a provision to require Medicare to cover telestroke, will be discussed Tuesday during a hearing of the Senate Finance Committee.Lori Hoopingarner savored her occasional weekend getaway.Between running her financial advising company, raising a 10-year-old daughter and 6-year-old son, having another daughter in college, and being without her husband – Darren, a fire captain – for at least 72 hours in a row each week, she earned those mini-vacations.So, a few times a year, her dad and stepmom babysat while she and Darren made the 1½-hour drive east from their home in Temecula, California, to the Indian Wells-Palm Springs area. They would leave around lunchtime on a Friday and return home on Sunday afternoon, fully recharged.On July 31, 2015, Lori and Darren were in their kitchen going over final details before heading on another of these trips. Lori bit into a tomato and suddenly “saw a red blur go from one side of my vision to the other.” She walked around the bar and sat at the kitchen table, clearly bothered by something.“What’s the matter?” Darren said, thinking she might be suffering a migraine.Lori couldn’t answer. Sensing something worse than a headache, Darren asked her to raise her arms. Only the left went up. As a trained first responder, he knew exactly what to do – and how to keep everyone else in the room calm.Soon Lori was being loaded into an ambulance. Although she couldn’t talk or move her right side, she thought about their pending trip: “We can leave tonight.”Even when the severity of her condition required her to go from a local hospital to the UC San Diego Medical Center an hour-long drive away, she still thought, “I guess we can leave in the morning.”***A blood clot had formed in Lori’s heart, escaped through a hole and worked its way to her brain. It became lodged there, a classic ischemic stroke.Lori eventually would learn that both the source of the clot and the hole were defects she was born with but doctors had never detected. Now, though, all that mattered was busting the clot.The gold standard of treatment is an intravenous drug known as r-tPA (alteplase). When given as quickly as possible, it can dramatically improve chances of recovery. Lori received a dose within the first hour. It didn’t work.Lori was at Temecula Valley Hospital, a Primary Stroke Center, meaning it meets certain standards set by the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association and The Joint Commission to support better outcomes of stroke care. Primary Stroke Centers can treat most strokes, but Lori needed an advanced procedure by a specialist who wasn’t available at her facility. And she needed it fast. It’s widely known among stroke experts that “time lost is brain lost,” a catchy phrase that means delays clearing the blockage can lead to more permanent damage or even death. So Temecula Valley doctors called UCSD for help. Minutes later, a new set of doctors surrounded Lori’s bed in the emergency room.On televisions.***The surgical team and neurologists appeared on monitors beside and behind the bed.

They recommended a procedure in which a device snaked into her brain would grab the clot and remove it. She needed to get to their facility right away.No helicopters were available. Neither were critical-care ambulances. Darren noticed that the ambulance that brought Lori in was still there. Strings were pulled so they could make the 58-mile trip; an ER nurse joined them, thus fashioning their own critical-care transport team.

This included Dr. Brett Meyer, a neurologist who is Medical Director of the UCSD Enterprise Telemedicine and Co-Director of UCSD Stroke Center.Darren’s parents were there, too.“What are they doing here?” Lori thought. She still couldn’t talk or move her right side. Now her left side was flopping like a fish out of water. Dr. Meyer asked her to stay still. The anesthesia made her drift away.

In 2013, the district put 79 abandoned schools up for sale. Today, more",2017-05-15,"<p>Dr. Vitti, incoming Superintendent of Detroit Schools. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5919ad57160000ad06c5b3d4.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There are more than 130 charter schools in Detroit. In 2013, the district put 79 abandoned schools up for sale. Today, more Detroit students attend charter schools than traditional public ones – developments that played a significant role in the rise of US Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.To most, the charter phenomenon in Detroit helped dig what was already a big hole for public schools suffering through unpreceded population and funding losses. In 1966, nearly 300,000 students went to city public schools. Today, it’s fewer than 45,000 – down from 90,000 in the past seven years alone, the time in which area charter schools have flourished.But the growth of largely unregulated charter school competition and the collapsing student population is just one challenge. And Detroit schools have plenty.According to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, which measures academic achievement in American schools, only 5 percent of Detroit fourth-graders were proficient in math in 2015. Which was actually an increase from 2013. Which was actually an increase from 2011.New Path? But after a controversial takeover of the district by state managers, a new round of intervention and $617 million in funding by state lawmakers, the district may be on a new path.That’s the hope of Dr. Nikolai Vitti and the Detroit School Board who, in their first major decision as a Board, hired him to be Detroit’s new Superintendent. His contract was approved Friday.Right now, Dr. Vitti is the Superintendent of Duval County, Florida (Jacksonville) and a native of Detroit (Dearborn Heights). And while Detroit’s job is definitely more visible and comes with more challenges and sleepless nights, it’s not – at least by the numbers – a step up.The Duval County Public Schools system is the 22nd largest in the nation with about 124,000 students. If you count only the students in non-charter schools, Detroit’s shrinking base of 45,000 students would not place among the top 100 largest districts.Fighting Even so, Dr. Vitti is in a fighting mood about public school competition and is eager to discuss his track record of success in Jacksonville and in places such as Miami-Dade, one of the largest, most diverse districts in the country.Talking to Dr. Vitti about his tenure in Jacksonville is like asking a concert pianist about why they love music while they’re late for a concert. You can sense his passion and his mastery of the subject – even at a pace that comes from not wanting to miss any detail or be even a second late for his next challenge. He’s proud to rattle off the numbers you can tell he knows by heart.With what you can sense is an eye on Detroit he says, “There’s a lot to be proud of.”“Narrowing the achievement gap in low performing schools, is a big one,” In fourth and eighth grade math and reading, Jacksonville is now among the top four urban districts in three-quarters of the measured areas, he said. “We’re in the top four with African-American students and in the top two with Hispanic students” in those metrics when compared with similar districts, Dr. Vitti said. “We went from fifth in African-American graduation rates to first. And we have the narrowest gap in reading between black and white students in all districts – the narrowest gap in algebra too,” he said.Although he did not make the comparison, it’s easy to see. On the National Assessment of Educational Progress in which just 5 percent of Detroit fourth-graders were proficient in math, 41 percent in Jacksonville were – placing it above the national average for large, urban districts.There are many more numbers from Dr. Vitti’s tenure in Jacksonville that point to improvement – far too many to list. And while the numbers in Jacksonville tell the what, they don’t tell the how.When I asked him how he did it and what that means for his future in Detroit, he said the story of Jacksonville’s improvement could be found in three areas: instruction, human investment and attention to the whole child.Here then, inferring from what he did in Jacksonville, is what may be on the educational horizon for one of the country’s most analyzed, more paralyzed districts:Instruction and Curriculum Revisions “Our inputs have changed to create better outputs,” Dr. Vitti said. “The core is instruction, be an educator,” – something Dr. Vitti was. He taught at the high school and middle school levels in North Carolina and New York City, according to his official bio. “I find it ironic that everyone talks about improving education and no one talks about improving instruction yet they wonder why student achievement doesn’t improve,” he said.In Jacksonville, Dr. Vitti and his team redrew the curriculum and designed accountability and support measurers for teachers. “So many people don’t get that right,” he said. “You think you can just do accountability. But for every degree of accountability, there has to be an equal degree of support.”Changes, Using Tech “We were very explicit about the need for strong leadership in our schools,” Dr. Vitti told me. In the beginning, he said, there were, “a significant number of principal changes. Too many schools had principals who were there to long. And we were trying to get skills sets and will sets connected to challenges and opportunities in specific schools,” he said.It was a rocky start as many left or accepted new positions at new institutions. “But we trained our leaders on instructional leadership and evaluated to that – how to give feedback, how to do professional development,” he said. Duval initiated a twice a year cutting edge Instructional Culture Survey by TNTP (The New Teacher Project) to bring focus to reasons why teachers stayed in or left the profession, information school leaders used to drive better teacher training and support.With that, the district invested heavily in elevating existing teaching talent, putting the best people in the places where they could do the most good and recruiting new teachers – especially those who fit with Dr. Vitti’s strong emphasis on the whole child. More on that in a moment.Investing in People “Organizations that improve invest in their people,” the Superintendent said. “And we had to be proactive about building a teaching pipeline because fewer and fewer of the best and brightest are going into teaching. We had to ask questions like, ‘How do we incentivize the best to go into teaching and stay as teachers?’”“We offered $20,000 above what they made to get our best teachers to stay in or relocate to specific schools,” he said. “Now 75% of those schools are [graded by the state as] “C” or higher or improved at least one letter grade and not one an “F” any longer.”“We also said to our teachers, we’ll pay for your Master’s Degree if you give us three years in our schools,” Dr. Vitti said. “It’s all part of growing the pipeline so we keep our best teachers and can bring in new ones.”Whole Child In what was the only thing he specifically said, “Can be transported to Detroit,” Dr. Vitti highlighted his district’s focus on the whole child – working on issues such as alternative discipline and mental health while keeping high stakes accountability measures in perspective. “As we shifted to start measuring how kids were performing, maybe that pendulum swung too far – and we started to ignore art, athletics and ignored how to engage kids in a positive way,” he said. “We became reactive, punitive. We forget we were kids, we made mistakes too.”The district again brought in technology, this time HERO K12, which enables districts, schools and teachers to consistently reinforce and track desired student behaviors such as good citizenship or punctuality. With it, he said, schools, “Create a culture to incentivize students to do the right thing, because you move behavior more by accentuating the positive.”And some people have seen the difference. “What Dr. Vitti’s whole child approach has done in Duval is remarkable,” said Robert Alonso, Director of Business Development at HERO K12. “By putting emphasis and attention on the positive, the culture and atmosphere in some of these schools has completely changed – I have seen first-hand the changes, making them a better place to teach and learn and work than they were,” he said.Under Dr. Vitti, Jacksonville schools also invested in mental health – bringing resources to schools so parents don’t have to navigate the red tape for mental health services. “All our employees are trained in mental health detection,” he said. He did that, he said, because, unrecognized and untreated, mental health issues can “manifest in negative behavior and negative interactions with their peers.”According to Dr. Vitti, out of school suspensions in Duval are down by more than a third since his programs started.Embracing Competition Given the climate of charters and choice in Detroit, Dr. Vitti’s words and attitudes on competition are likely to stir passions.“You’ve got to embrace competition, embrace choice and own that landscape and not be intimidated or reactive,” he said. It’s essential, he said, to, “embrace the opportunity to compete with private and charter – offer an experience that’s better.”“When public education gets it right, they get it really right – better than our competitors,” he said. For example, New Orleans, he said, “has been defined as a place of transformation, a place where charters work. What I want Detroit to be is the Mecca of transformation through traditional education – a place where everyone will eventually go to be part of the work – a place reformers will really flock to.”Those are strong words. It’s understandable to be skeptical.Can He Do It? The question on the minds of Detroit parents, teachers, students and stakeholders – and education observers nationally – is simple: Can Dr. Vitti transport his Jacksonville accomplishments and reforms to Detroit?That probably depends on whether you think Detroit schools can find success at all. If you do, it’s difficult to question Dr. Vitti’s passion or his successes. Or overlook that those closest to his schools see his achievements too – the headline in Jacksonville’s newspaper as news of his Detroit offer spread was, “Nikolai Vitti did what hired to do: Make changes in Jacksonville’s schools.”If any place is in need of change, it’s Detroit.As I asked him if he was ready for the spotlight and the challenges that await him there, he was, characteristically, not shy. “Once you’ve been through the rodeo you learn how the bull kicks you off. I’ll be even better at this rodeo,” he said.Many people hope so. There’s a lot riding on it."

The G6—as it was then—was first created in 1975, a year named “International Women’s Year” by the United Nations to help more women worldwide realize their full potential. Mountain climber Junko Tabei masterfully demonstrated this potential when she became the first woman to conquer Mount Everest in that year. However, as the world dealt with the aftermath of the first oil shock and the end of the fixed exchange rate system, global economic stability and women’s empowerment were rarely part of the same conversation.How times have changed. Today, in discussions on the global economy, female economic empowerment is almost always on the agenda.Women’s economic empowerment mattersThis is, first of all, because women matter, full stop. Second, there are large benefits for all of society, and this includes men, women, and children, to be had from raising women’s participation in the economy—it can boost GDP growth, help economies diversify, and tackle income inequality.At the IMF, we are incorporating gender-related considerations in the policy advice we provide to our member countries—so far, we have completed consultations along these lines with 22 countries, with more to come. Our recent programs—including with Egypt, Jordan, and Niger—also contain specific measures to help empower women economically.To inform the G7 discussion of gender equality, under the Italian Presidency, the IMF prepared a paper—Gender Budgeting in G7 Countries—as a contribution to the meeting this weekend.One of the lessons of the paper is that, despite progress made by most G7 countries in improving gender equality (see chart below), there is still a large unfinished agenda. For example, in advanced industrial countries, women’s labor market participation rate is about 17 percentage points lower than men’s. The wage gap between women and men amounts to roughly 14 percent. The share of male managers is almost double that of women, and almost 70 percent of unpaid work is performed by women.Budgets should promote gender equalityThe point I was making to the G7 countries is that, to make further progress, national budgets can be used more actively as a tool to support gender equality. For example, in advanced economies, tax policies play an important role in addressing disincentives for secondary earners to work. Spending policies can help too, for instance by supporting childcare facilities. One example is the Canadian child benefit scheme, which helps families with the cost of childcare through a tax-free, income-tested benefit. This and other examples are listed in the table below.Gender-responsive budgeting is about analyzing fiscal policies and budgetary decisions to understand their impact—both intended and unintended—on gender equality. Such approaches can be applied at all stages of the budget cycle.While G7 countries have made effective use of a wide range of fiscal and nonfiscal policies to reduce gender inequality, they have generally made less progress in developing the broad-based budgetary institutions that are essential to mainstream gender policies.For example, only Canada, France, and Japan publish a gender budget statement. And while most G7 countries undertake a gender impact assessment of new policy proposals, the approaches and methodologies vary widely.More work to be doneWhat else could G7 countries do to strengthen their budgetary institutions’ consideration of gender issues?Gender budgeting needs to be mainstreamed. This includes embedding gender issues in the annual dialog between ministers on budget priorities, and in other budget routines.At the IMF, we will continue to work on these issues as part of our broader efforts to promote inclusive growth. This includes, for example, providing technical assistance to over 120 countries—including recent work on Cambodia’s financial information systems, the Medium-Term Budget Framework in Ukraine, and the Fiscal Transparency Evaluation in Austria, just to name a few representative cases. And we remain committed, across the full range of our activities, to helping women make the most of their economic potential.Just as Junko Tabei went on to become the first woman to climb the “Seven Summits”—the highest mountains across seven continents—today many women are scaling heights in the workplace and the wider economy. But much remains to be done.Therefore, I am calling on G7 policymakers to strengthen gender budgeting to contribute to women’s economic empowerment and promote global economic stability at the same time."
44,THE WORLDPOST,Dear Trump: The Iran Deal Worked. Apply The Same Approach To North Korea.,"David Cortright, ContributorDirector of Policy Studies, Kroc Institute for International P...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-north-korea-nuclear_us_590b83efe4b0e7021e95cee5,The Iran nuclear deal is a model for creatively packaging pressures and inducements.,2017-05-15,A soldier salutes during North Korea's military parade on April 15.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/590b8a831600001f00c597dc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The nuclear danger in North Korea is serious and growing. In response, it’s time to turn to the diplomatic model successfully applied in Iran. The newly elected president of South Korea, Moon Jae-in, is a proponent of negotiating with Pyongyang and could be a valuable ally for the United States in attempting to reach a diplomatic solution.Punitive measures and military threats against North Korea have not worked in the past and are unlikely to succeed now. The leaders of North Korea will not give up the bomb until they feel more secure. The more threatened they feel, the more they cling to the bomb for survival.Instead of pressure and provocation that could lead to war, we need a package of measures that combines the threat of more pressure with a comprehensive set of inducements that could persuade the regime to accept limitations on its nuclear program. Research I published for the Carnegie Commission on Preventing Deadly Conflict shows how sanctions and incentives together can be effective for nonproliferation diplomacy.The Iran nuclear deal is a model for creatively packaging pressures and inducements. The U.S. joined with the European Union and the U.N. Security Council to impose stringent sanctions that significantly constrained Iran’s economy while also offering inducements: promising to lift sanctions and renew trade in exchange for nuclear restrictions. The deal worked: the threat from the Iranian nuclear program is now diminished. U.N. inspectors certify that Iran remains fully in compliance.As with the Iran deal, it will be necessary at the outset to be realistic about objectives. A fully denuclearized Korean peninsula is not feasible in the near term, so we need to set our sights lower and seek a halt to further nuclearization. This was also the goal in the Iran negotiations — achieving a verifiable halt to further nuclear development.Diplomatic success will require cooperation with China. Beijing agrees with the U.S. on wanting to halt further nuclearization. They have supported U.N. sanctions against North Korea and would be prepared to offer an inducement package of economic assistance and security guarantees. But China is opposed to any action that might bring down the regime, which could create a huge economic and refugee crisis, not to mention the threat of possible war spreading across the border.If the U.S. and China can agree on a joint strategy (nuclear freeze, no regime change, a package of sanctions and incentives), they will have the support of their partners in the six-party talks (along with South Korea, Japan and Russia) and the U.N. Security Council.The diplomatic strategy should include a credible threat of more effective sanctions. The latest report from a U.N. Security Council panel of experts identifies a number of steps for ratcheting up pressures on the financial and commercial networks that sustain the regime’s weapons program. These and other sanctions measures should be incorporated into a new Security Council resolution that would go into force if North Korea refuses to negotiate or does not agree to verifiable steps toward restricting its program. As with the Iran model, the proposed resolution would include a commitment to lift sanctions when the regime accepts a verified freeze on its nuclear program.Stronger sanctions would be combined with a set of security, diplomatic and economic inducements designed to encourage denuclearization. Examples of such steps include:Renewing the security guarantee the U.S. offered in 2005 pledging not to attack North Korea with conventional or nuclear weapons.The inducements could be offered sequentially in discreet packages and delivered as reciprocal responses to specific verifiable steps toward nuclear restraint.There’s no guarantee that the proposed strategy will work, of course, but it is the most viable approach, the least bad option among the undesirable choices available. It offers a chance to contain the North Korean nuclear threat before it gets out of hand while lowering political tension and reducing the risk of war."

That has changed.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58af4d002900002200f285c9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Cadiz Inc., which has long sought the federal government’s green light to pump groundwater from the Mojave Desert and pipe it to Southern California, has seen the project’s prospects brighten under the Trump administration.In April, a potential backer of the project was nominated by President Donald Trump to a high-ranking Interior Department post.In late March, the department’s Bureau of Land Management rescinded two legal directives the Obama administration used in a 2015 decision to block Cadiz from building the 43-mile pipeline. The BLM also declared that any reconsideration of that decision would be handled by its Washington office, rather than the agency’s California officials who made the call in 2015.Under Trump, several efforts are underway to undo Obama-era environmental policies.The Obama administration’s decision that effectively blocked the pipeline is still in effect, but Scott Slater, Cadiz’s CEO, is expressing confidence about the project’s chances. He told the Los Angeles Times last month he’s “cautiously optimistic” more good news will be coming from the BLM following the decision undercutting the legal directives.Project investors also appear upbeat — the company announced last week it had lined up some $255 million in construction financing from a large private equity firm. The project would carry water to the Colorado River Aqueduct in Southern California.The pipeline may have gotten another boost last month with Trump’s nomination of attorney David Bernhardt, who led the Trump transition team at Interior, to be the department’s deputy secretary.Bernhardt works alongside Cadiz’s Slater, who is also an attorney, at the well-connected Washington-based law firm of Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck. The two previously co-chaired the firm’s natural resources department.The firm will earn 200,000 shares of stock in Cadiz — worth about $3 million at today’s value — if the water pipeline is completed.David Lamfrom, who as director of the National Parks Conservation Association’s California desert and wildlife programs has been closely monitoring the project for years, said he believes its improved fortunes under the new administration are no coincidence.“Any reasonable person would believe these things are connected,” Lamfrom told HuffPost. “It’s hard for me to believe there’s another reason why the administration would be thinking about Cadiz and prioritizing it. I think everyone understands that this is a conflict of interest.”In a statement to HuffPost, Interior Department spokeswoman Megan Bloomgren said that, should Bernhardt be confirmed for his post, he would have no financial interest in the law firm or its clients and would follow the guidance of the agency’s ethics personnel, per the terms of the ethics agreement he has already signed.Further, Bloomgren said, Bernhardt would “absolutely recuse himself from any manner” in which previous employers or parties to previous employers have a financial interest.Cadiz officials did not respond to a request for comment for this story, but Slater insisted in his interview with the Los Angeles Times that he did not believe Bernhardt had “anything to do” with the BLM’s change on the legal directives concerning the project. Company spokespeople have stated elsewhere that Bernhardt has never lobbied on behalf of Cadiz. Bernhardt did not reply to a request for comment.As Cadiz describes it, the project would draw groundwater that would otherwise evaporate from basins underlying the Mojave Desert, creating a new source of water for Southern California communities who have struggled with droughts and rising water costs. Many water providers have said they would use water from the project.The pipeline’s critics maintain it would damage the desert’s ecosystem — which is home to endangered wildlife and unique vegetation like the picturesque Joshua trees — by pulling unsustainable amounts of water from the desert.Cadiz has said that the basins it would draw from — at a rate of at least 50,000 acre-feet of water per year — would be recharged at a rate of 32,000 acre-feet annually. But a study by the U.S. Geological Survey disputes those figures.Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), an outspoken critic of the project, this week shared a letter from the agency saying its review of the basins had estimated a far lower recharge rate of 2,000 to 10,000 acre-feet per year.“Based on the independent study by the USGS, it’s clear that Cadiz would quickly drain the aquifer, destroying all of the desert life it supports,” Feinstein said in a statement.Despite its recent momentum, the Cadiz project has a number of obstacles it must yet overcome.The Obama administration’s 2015 decision on it meant that the project would require a lengthy federal environmental review.Whether the Trump administration reverses that decision remains an open question. Bloomgren notes that Interior’s department-wide review of opinions made by the previous administration, including those concerning the Cadiz project, is ongoing.Cadiz must also get construction permits from the state of California, as well as win approval from the agency that operates the Colorado River Aqueduct. That agency, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, has emphasized that it wants the company to remove the carcinogenic chemical Chromium-6 from the water it transports — a process that may not be simple, though Cadiz has already secured an agreement to address the contaminant.“I don’t think it’s a done deal by any stretch of the imagination,” Lamfrom said.Still, environmentalists acknowledge Cadiz has good reason for optimism about its chances under the Trump administration.Mariana Maguire, Southern California associate director for conservation at the Conservation Lands Foundation, said she is concerned the administration is ignoring both input from Mojave residents and the scientific studies of the project’s potential impact.“The administration seems to be taking a position of pushing all that aside and not giving it credence,” Maguire told HuffPost. If the project moves forward, Lamfrom said he believes it could have an impact far beyond the Mojave.“There’s the potential that this serves as a harmful model for people who want to drain public lands,” he said. “It’s a roadmap to a place where most Americans don’t want to go.”―Joseph Erbentraut covers promising innovations and challenges in the areas of food, water, agriculture and our climate.

More than 1,200 have died on the way.With rising arrivals, calls are growing for intervention in the African countries where most of the migrants originate and which they cross in their quest to reach Europe.The coastguard gave no details about where the migrants rescued on Saturday came from, but most arriving in Italy come originally from sub-Saharan Africa or Bangladesh, and pay Libya-based smugglers to organize their passage.Italy and Germany sent a joint letter on May 11 to the European Union to ask for a mission to be sent to Libya’s southern border, which many migrants cross on their way north, an Italian interior ministry source said on Sunday.In the letter, the interior ministers, Marco Minniti and Thomas de Maziere, asked for a greater EU commitment to help stabilize the roughly 5,000 km (3,100 mile)-long border which Libya has long struggled to control, the source said.A senior official in the United Nations-backed Libyan government in Tripoli said on Sunday his administration was ready to create a new guard to patrol the frontier, but it could only be secured if other countries helped.“If we don’t resolve southern Libya’s problems, we will not resolve the migrant issue,” Abdulsalam Kajman, vice president in the U.N.-backed government headed by Fayez Seraj, told Italy’s Corriere della Sera newspaper.“The difficult economic situation in that region pushes lots of young people to work for the traffickers,” Kajman said, adding Italy had said it was willing to train the new guard.Libya primarily needs administrative and logistical help, he added, saying Turkey had donated 20 tonnes of medicine but that now needed to be taken to southern Libya and distributed.“(Italian Interior Minister Marco) Minniti has told us Italy is ready to dispatch mobile hospitals, but we need other countries and the European Union to lend a hand too,” he said.(Reporting by Isla Binnie; Editing by Gareth Jones"

The airline, meanwhile, argues a video shot by the passengers doesn’t capture the whole story and says they were kicked off because their behavior “demonstrated a risk for additional escalation in air.” Cameron Burke was heading to Las Vegas with his wife and two kids out of New York’s JFK airport on May 3 when they and crewmembers had a conflict over how the birthday cake was stored, leading to the entire plane having to disembark, WABC News reported.The family allegedly placed the dessert in an overhead bin reserved for emergency equipment. In a statement, the airline maintains that the family “refused multiple requests from the crew to remove the items.”Instead of immediately complying, “The customers became agitated, cursed and yelled at the crew, and made false accusations about a crewmember’s fitness to fly,” the airline said.The Burke family, speaking to WABC News, denies the airline’s claim that they refused to comply and used vulgar language. In a video uploaded to social media, Cameron Burke is seen calmly addressing a Port Authority police officer as his son sobs across from him. His daughter, seen next to his wife who is wearing a tiara for her birthday, tells her father, “Daddy, I feel scared.”“Has this since been resolved?” the officer asks the family.“Yes, it’s on the floor,” Cameron Burke replies, referring to the cake.The officer tells the family they did nothing wrong but will have to rebook their flight, according to the airline’s orders.Speaking to WABC News after, the family called the airline’s response overblown and the flight attendants’ handling of the situation chaotic.“She was pointing to her, did you tell him he couldn’t put anything in the overhead compartment?” Cameron said one flight attendant said to another. “I had approached them, and I said everything was fine, and she said, ‘Sir, this does not involve you,’” he said one flight attendant told him. “When she told me I had been non-compliant, then I said, ‘Ma’am, had you been drinking?’ because her behavior was not normal.”The airline says the family’s behavior was different after they began filming.“The video circulating does not depict the entire incident and only starts after the objectionable behavior occurred and law enforcement were called,” an airline spokesperson told HuffPost on Sunday.“The Captain determined the customers’ behavior demonstrated a risk for additional escalation in air and would not be allowed to fly. A full refund was given. The remaining customers re-boarded and the flight departed without further interruption,” the airline’s statement continued.Cameron Burke, speaking to the New York Daily News, said he plans to file a lawsuit against the airline. He also wants the flight attendant fired.“She has no business serving the public,” he told the news site. “I hope JetBlue will retrain their staff and recreate the culture I once loved.”The airline noted that passengers are allowed to bring one carry-on and one personal item, including cakes, so long as they are within the size limits."

Their accumulated wisdom helps us understand what truly matters in life. Growing up in India and then later in England and America, I was the closest to my maternal grandfather, Nana. Nana, Gyanendra Nath Verma, came from a small poor town of Barabanki in North India. At the age of 18 he moved to a larger city of Allahabad in search of higher education. Nana’s humble beginnings consisted of delivering newspaper in his neighborhood, studying under the streetlights, surviving on a minimal diet, and tutoring in between his classes. He overcame all the impediments and successfully became a lawyer, had a thriving career, and left a legacy in his name in Allahabad. 1) Work hard, Play hard: Nana had worked extremely hard for his career and took his work very seriously. However, he knew the importance of balance in life. His adventures, functions, and travels complemented his hard work and thriving career.2) Always make time for yourself: In the midst of his busy day, I would often catch him sitting alone soaking in his own company. He was reenergized and rejuvenated when he spent time with himself, and he truly taught me the joy of enjoying ones own company. 3) Always spend quality time with others: He always made my brother and I a priority no matter how packed his schedule. He was a man of his words and people could always count on him. He celebrated the good in his loved ones lives, but more importantly was always there for their trials and tribulations. And Nana always managed to make friends while traveling the world. It is because of Nana that I understand the sacredness of a human connection. 4) Live from the heart: Nana lived life on his own terms. Others may have not agreed with his decisions in life, but he knew he was not here to live anyone else’s life, but only his very own. 5) Travel the world: Every summer Nana would pack his suitcase and embark on colorful adventures. His life was saturated with experiences of different cultures and people, and he always had interesting life stories for our coffee and dinner dates. 6) Have a morning routine: He woke up every morning at the same time, went on his daily walk, and always had breakfast before leaving for work. I later realized that his morning ritual is what had set him up for a fruitful day, every single day. 7) Don’t follow the crowd: Nana had several brothers and sisters out of whom he was the most successful and abundant in life. He lived a very unorthodox life by Indian standards and never looked around to see what others were doing. He paved his own path and danced to his own tune. This unique approach to life inspired me to fully understand who I am and never apologize for it. 8) Help others: I had always seen the generous side of Nana, however at Nana’s funeral my family and I were astounded by all the people who came forth with their stories of how Nana had impacted their lives. Whether it was paying for their children’s education, helping them establish a career, donating to the orphanage, or just helping a friend in time of need, Nana’s generosity was unbounded. Nana helped me recognize all the things we accumulate in life are not ours to keep; when we are gone they stay behind, thus we might as well give them away while we are still here. 9) Laugh a lot: A LOT. And don’t ever stop. 10) Believe in handwritten notes: Growing up in England and America Nana’s handwritten letters came weekly. As children my brother and I were encouraged by our mother to respond to Nana’s letters. Whether we talked about our birthday gifts, how great or rough school was, or just updated Nana on our viral infections and runny noses, our letters to each other were rich in emotions, filled with experiences, and bridged the distance we had between each other. Nana is the reason why I believe in the beauty of hand-composed notes. Nana became an integral part of who I am today, because I had the honor of witnessing his life firsthand. I spent countless hot Indian summers in his company and explored several countries with him. Through Nana I understood the significance of adventure, hard work, independence, and open-mindedness, as well as the richness of close family and friends. Our grandparents never leave us, they continue to live because so much of them is reflected in us. The eleventh life lesson I have learned is the most crucial one. Grandparents open your eyes to the scenery that calls your name, they free your thoughts to help you understand who you are, and they impart their life lessons so you don’t have to learn it the hard way. If one is fortunate enough to have a grandparent in their lives, one must bask in their company, as no one else can impact your world the way a grandparent can. "

In the 458 BC drama by Aeschylus we’re told Agamemnon was greeted by “a crimson path” to walk on, and (despite his being murdered shortly afterwards) it’s become the ultimate accolade to celebrate and recognize the importance of a guest.You can tell a lot about government from who it invites to walk on its red carpet. Egyptian dictator President Sisi got the honor at the White House a few weeks ago. “We are very much behind President al-Sisi. He’s done a fantastic job,” enthused President Trump about a man who has dragged Egypt back to a totalitarianism not seen for generations. Authoritarian Turkish President Erdogan is due to arrive at the White House on Tuesday this week, and Trump has even invited Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte to visit. Duterte’s government has waged a “war on drugs” that has resulted in the extrajudicial killing of thousands of Filipinos, has frequently spoken favorably of murder and rape, and compared himself positively to Hitler.Tomorrow it’s the turn of Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed, head of the notorious State Security Apparatus in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to grace the scarlet fabric. Bin Zayed is a frequent visitor to Washington, and was regularly invited to meet senior United States officials under the Obama administration too. But the White House should be place where the world’s top civil society leaders are celebrated, not a place where repressive leaders are legitimized.Bin Zayed’s State Security outfit is the UAE’s Stasi, regularly suppresses freedom of speech and ruthlessly suffocates civil society voices of those critical of the regime. On March 20 this year the famous human rights defender and University of Colorado grad Ahmed Mansour, winner of the 2015 Martin Ennals Human Rights Defender Award, was taken from his home in Dubai.UN human rights experts have called for his immediate release, and he’s known as an astute but peaceful critic of the UAE’s dictatorship. He’s also the guy who last year saved your iPhone from hackers. I understand his wife Nadia has not been able to visit him for over a month, and given the UAE’s awful record of torturing its detainees there is real fear for his safety.It’s Mansour who should be invited to Washington to represent the best of the UAE, not Bin Zayed. So should academic, economist, human rights defender and alum of Ohio’s Case Western Reserve University Dr. Nasser bin Ghaith, who was sentenced to 10 years in a UAE prison after an unfair trial. According to the Gulf Center for Human Rights he has not had any contact with the outside world since his transfer to Al-Razeen Prison on 30 March 2017.But Bin Zayed represents a different UAE, one that suppresses democracy and dissent, and the U.S. government has long enabled that repression. The State Department last week approved a new $2bn deal to sell 160 missiles and other military equipment to the Emirates, the latest in a long line of arms deals with the Gulf state dating back many years. Washington operates in an apparent state of denial about the UAE, and has long kidded itself that the absolute monarchy is “a force for political stability,” while knowing deep down that repression and stability are mutually exclusive.While Trump invites dictators to the White House, Members of Congress who care about rights should draw up a list of human rights defenders, find dissents targeted by repressive regimes, and roll out the red carpet for them at the Capitol."

What will it take for a worldwide intervention? What will it take for someone to do something?Happy Mother’s Day, Mom, as you sit in your condo in the Dummar neighborhood in Damascus, which thankfully hasn’t seen much action. Other places are completely wiped out. Your place is still there. How is it today? Are they shooting at each other nearby? Are bombs falling from the sky? Has anyone we know died?I am sitting at a Starbucks writing this and wishing you were here with me. Where I am, there is no bombing, shooting, or killing. The worst that could happen is for me to park at the end of creation in the hot parking lot.It’s Mother’s Day.Many will take their moms out to lunch today. Many will give them gifts, make them breakfast, take them shopping. A decision has to be made when you ask: “Would you like this yellow shirt or these blue shoes?”Mom, you have to decide whether you will stay inside today and increase your chances of being alive. A month ago, a bomb fell on a building where people we know lived. They no longer live there, or anywhere. They are dead. Will you stay alive today?We are witnessing another Holocaust.This one regards people of different faiths ― Muslims, Christians, and other minorities in turmoil. They are dying at a high and scary rate, while the citizens of the free and peaceful world are watching.When did religion come to justify killing those who are different from you? I was under the impression it meant to love others. My religion has become “Love.” The religious labels in the world today are not practicing that virtue. When religion justifies killing someone, its not religion, its evil.I will go to Yoga todayWhat will you do, Mom? Other than staying indoors scared for your life? Or dreaming of a peaceful world? Or remembering when you could walk the streets of Damascus without a worry?What will you do today? Will you go shopping? Doubtful. Will you be invited to lunch at your favorite restaurant? Is your favorite restaurant even still there? That place in Bloudan we used to go to and order a hefty feast and laugh and love each other. Last I heard, Bloudan was wiped out.Why can’t someone do something?Why? We have solved world problems before, peacefully. Where is the United Nations? Where are the world leaders who have guts? Where are they? The ones who can talk the fighting factions into sitting around a table and solving the problem of Syria peacefully. What happened that we could turn our face away from the television showing little kids mutilated, or in body bags? When did we become so numb?If you are a United States congressman or senator, please read the following paragraph.I beg you to do something. Get a committee started, talk to your fellow congressmen and senators, take a group to visit Syria and see the carnage mounting. I am worn out saying the same thing over and over. Is anyone listening? Please do not just click for the next page. Make that phone call that can start the process of ending the war in Syria. Make that move. You will be a hero, for me, for my mother, and for millions of Syrian refugees who have lost everything.I remember, Mom.I remember the birthday cake you made me when I was ten years old. It was ten layers on top of each other, with ten candles. When I blew them, I made a wish. You know what that wish was? For my upstairs neighbor, Heather, to fall in love with me, like I was with her. People all over the world have no idea that we have love also, in the middle of Damascus. We love each other, we love others, and we just want to live in peace.I wish you a peaceful Mother’s Day, Mom, please stay alive.For more, visit Arab in Alabama."

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that globally S. pneumoniae kills close to 500,000 children less than 5 years old annually, with most of the deaths occurring in developing countries.Currently, a 10-valent polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccine and a 13-valent polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccine are marketed internationally. Both vaccines are considered safe and effective against vaccine serotypes but do not protect against all 90 plus pneumococcal serotypes. Deployment of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) has had clear public health benefits: the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease has been reduced not only in vaccinated children, but also in elderly adults, who benefit from herd immunity; hospital admissions for community-acquired pneumonia among children less than two years old have been reduced, and the incidence of acute otitis media in healthy vaccinated children has decreased. In 2007, the WHO recommended the use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in all countries.Catch Up GameAn impediment to the accomplishments of PCV is that the vaccines cover just the most common pneumococcal serotypes, giving way to the expansion of and rise in antibiotic resistance of other types (not included in the vaccine). A study in Euro surveillance analysis of S pneumonia isolates collected by the surveillance programs of the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC) and Public Health England (PHE) has found that serotype 15A is becoming increasingly prevalent. Serotype 15A is of particular interest since multidrug-resistant isolates belonging to this serotype have been reported as far apart as Australia, East Asia, Italy, North America and Norway. S pneumoniae 15A is not covered by the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. 15A is one of the more than 90 pneumococcal serotypes not included in the 13-valent vaccine. The rise of 15A means that conjugate vaccines will face an ongoing game of catch-up whereby vaccine manufacturers increase the quantity of serotypes included in the vaccine to cover serotypes that were once not prevalent. The More the Merrier Vaccine research is taking place to find a vaccine that is more affordable and offers broad protection across all pneumococcal serotypes. The broader protection is particularly relevant for low-income countries where there is a broader spectrum of serotypes (not in the vaccine) that cause disease. Current manufacturers of the pneumo vaccines have invested a lot to support Gavi in meeting country demand and are developing multi-dose vials that reduce cold chain requirements and allow more children to be vaccinated. Most of these efforts are preclinical and are designed to develop vaccines similar to the currently licensed PCVs Prevenar 13 and Synflorix at a lower cost. Not to be left out, US-based Merck and Co. and France-based Sanofi have also joined the race to develop new PCVs, which are in various stages of clinical development. The most exceptional candidates are 10-to 13-valent PCVs being created by the Serum Institute of India, Ltd., SK Chemical Co., and Panacea Biotech, Ltd. Competition from new companies will definitely bring down prices overall. Nonetheless, because of the complexities of building up a technologically advanced vaccine covering an expansive number of strains of pneumococcal disease, we may only see these new vaccines in 2018 or later. GlaxoSmithKline made a commitment to provide the pneumococcal vaccine at the lowest ever price at US$3.05 for doses being provided from 2017, a reduction of 10% from the current price of $3.40. The price will be available through the Advance Market Commitment (AMC) to all Gavi countries as well as for countries using the vaccine when they transition from Gavi support and will continue at this price for ten years after the transition. The AMC, designed to stimulate the development and manufacture of vaccines for low-income countries. Donors commit money to guarantee the price of vaccines once they are developed, giving that they meet particular and strict, per-agreed criteria on adequacy, cost, availability, and that developing countries demand them. Pricing of vaccines remain a contentious topic. In October last year, Doctors Without Borders turned down free pneumonia vaccines saying that pharmaceutical companies use donations as a way to make others “pay up.” Companies use this to justify why prices remain high for others. Pfizer has also lowered the price of its pneumococcal vaccine to non-governmental organizations that supply developing countries. The company will sell the newest version of its Prevnar 13 vaccine for $3.10 a dose, the same price that Gavi has paid since 2015.A Game-changer?While pneumococcal conjugate vaccines are highly effective, they are extremely complex and generally exorbitant vaccines to make. Pneumococcal protein vaccines, on the contrary, are more efficient and less expensive to manufacture and have the potential to provide broad coverage across all serotypes and avoid the problems of serotype replacement by directly targeting proteins highly preserved among many pneumococcal serotypes. PATH and Boston Children’s Hospital are working on the development of an inactivated, pneumococcal whole cell vaccine candidate (PATH-wSP), that could provide broad protection and be relatively cheap to produce and easy to administer.Although pneumococcal vaccination coverage is increasing globally, it is nowhere near optimal vaccination rates. A vaccine is only useful if administered. A vaccine not given is a health risk ignored and – for the more vulnerable members of society – a hospitalization or death that could have been prevented."

Present, too, were the families of other sons felled in fatal encounters with police. On Mother’s Day Eve, as we stood together in front of the Frank Crowley Courts Building, one by one, mourning mothers offered remembrances of their sons forever taken from their warm embrace.The stairs ascending to the Crowley Building are indeed steep. Under a bright and sweltering sun, they appeared even steeper. The building itself resembles a fortress, unwelcoming and inhospitable to the very justice that we seek.Yet, we remained undeterred. We were there not only to remember, but to ensure that no more injustices come to the Edwards family or to any family still seeking justice for their loved ones.I stood beside one particular mother as she shared precious memories of her son. The weight of her grief continued to grow as she spoke until it became so heavy that she could no longer speak. Her legs appeared to weaken, and I began to worry that she might crumble to the ground under the tremendous weight that she carried. I held her up and walked her away - away from the crowd, away from the cameras - under the cool shade of nearby trees.I embraced her. She rested her weary head in the cup of my shoulder.Then she wept. And wept. And wept bitterly.She wept until her weeping turned to moaning.Then she moaned. And moaned. And moaned. And moaned. And moaned.She moaned so deeply it felt as if she might uproot the trees surrounding us.Then silence.She could moan no more.I prayed with her and for her. When she regained her strength, we walked back over together to lay her white flowers upon the growing memorial. A sea of white flowers already adorned the pavement. Traditionally given on Mother’s Day to those whose mothers have dearly departed, instead, this day, the mothers received white flowers in memory of their dearly departed sons.Before I walked the mother over to the memorial, she did utter one phrase;“Why, God?”I did not offer a response for I wondered the same."

U.S. President Donald Trump campaigned on an “America first,2017-05-14,<p>PM Justin Trudeau and President Trump meet at the White House for the first time on Feb. 13.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5918c79d1e00009500622f6d.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The state of American-Canadian relations is at a critical point. U.S. President Donald Trump campaigned on an “America first” platform, with calls to dramatically alter the North American free-trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. This has sent alarms off in Canada, with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau quick to quell uncertainty surrounding President Trump’s rhetoric ahead of the P.M.’s first trip to the White House on Feb. 13. While former House Speaker and Trump surrogate Newt Gingrich has also assured that Canada will be virtually unscathed, those north of the border are still fully aware that they are a mouse in bed with an elephant.The Myth of U.S. Reliance on Trade with CanadaRahim Madhavji, President of Toronto-based Knightsbridge Foreign Exchange, is not buying the positive talking points being pushed in Canadian parliament and sees a serious threat to economic output north of the border.“Trump is a wildcard and everyone needs to pay attention,” Madhavji says. “I think we’re going to see a lot of volatility for the loonie as trade rhetoric plays out in the open. Any trade war will be negative for the Canadian dollar. Period. Canada needs to ensure it makes a good deal on NAFTA with the USA otherwise economic prospects and the Canadian dollar will be hurt.”The Canadian government constantly reminds citizens that Canada is the U.S.’s largest trading partner with 35 states reliant on exporting across the border and that opting out of NAFTA would be far more detrimental to Americans. This is a fallacy. Not only is the U.S. the largest economy in the world with the highest GDP which makes the states perfectly able to trade between each other, in fact, only Michigan and Vermont has an annual economic output that depends on trade with Canada that exceeds 10 per cent. “Canada-U.S. trade matters much more for Canada than the United States,” University of Calgary economics professor Trevor Tombe told The Globe & Mail. On the other hand, a volatile loonie is a thorn in the side of Canadian manufacturing because the country’s largest provinces rely on steady cross-border trade with 49 per cent of Ontario’s GDP, as well as 23 percent for Quebec, and 31 percent for Alberta. Tombe sees the potential for further disputes as the Trump administration seeks to tighten borders and ramps up his protectionist rhetoric. Trade War Few Canadians remember an uneasy trade relationship with the U.S., but as President Trump continues to press both P.M. Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto for a renegotiation of NAFTA, it has the potential to set off a nasty trade war. Tweaking of the deal can only occur in August at the earliest, that’s if Trump immediately sent a 90-day notice to Congress. However, he hasn’t as of yet because U.S. lawmakers have been slow to approve the contents of the letter. Trump will need to act quickly with his proposed changes to NAFTA before the Mexican election, in which President Nieto is likely to be voted out due to increasing public unrest over gas prices. The next president may not be as willing to cooperate with Trump who seeks to build a wall that physically and psychologically separates the two nations. In Trump’s first escalation with Canada, he slapped a 24 per cent tariff on Canadian lumber, which he says was necessary because American workers have suffered from unfair subsidies north of the border where there is cheap access to public land. A trade war, in which one country deliberately hurts another country’s exports in order to embolden their own for autarky goals, results in the other country responding by doing the same. A trade war should be avoided, especially if one country has all the cards, like in U.S.-Canada relations. Despite Canada surely coming out as the loser in this event, a Nanos Research survey from early this year found that “58 per cent of Canadians surveyed would ‘support’ or ‘somewhat support’ Canada having a trade war with the U.S.” While only 35 per cent opposed escalations. Even with a tariff on Canadian lumber, White House press secretary Sean Spicer responded with a dismissive “no” when a reporter asked about the prospect of a trade war. Indicating that existing trade remedy procedures have been effective. ""That's why we have dispute-settlement mechanisms to do this in a responsible way,"" Spicer said. ""Let's let it play out. But I think secretary [Wilbur] Ross took appropriate action to protect the U.S. industry and we're going to let the process play out.""Canada, however, is not ready to stand by idly with Trump’s action remaining unchecked. The Canadian government proposed last week that retaliation can come in two forms: a ban on coal exports to the U.S. from B.C. and a study on potential duties on products from Oregon. The reason for targeting the state of Oregon is Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden. The senator has been an outspoken opponent of softwood lumber settlement in his state, so sources telling the Canadian Press have brought up the potential for an investigation into hefty duties on flooring, plywood, wood chips, packing and wine from Oregon. U.S.-Canada Relations going ForwardCanada’s biggest allies are senators and governors of northern border states as other factors beyond trade such as tourism and cross-border shoppers are an intrinsic part of the economies in Michigan, Washington and New York State. It may be difficult for Canada to implement punitive tariffs without first complaining to the World Trade Organization about President Trump’s emotionally fueled actions and how the president has little comprehension of the U.S.-Canada trade relationship. It’s important to note that cross-border trade between the two nations have not always been smooth. In 2005, Canada’s former agricultural minister Ralph Goodale was embroiled in a dispute over the Byrd Amendment, a U.S. law implemented to funnel crash from tariffs on foreign goods to American companies. This pushed Goodale and the Liberal government to compile a list of states that would be targeted with punitive measures, that would in turn, have little blow-back effect on Canada. However, trade hostilities did not last long which started as restrictions on U.S. motorboat imports and was eventually reduced to heavy tariffs on innocuous imports like tropical fish. Whatever measures are implemented, PM Trudeau will have to weather a fluctuating dollar due to President Trump venting his trade qualms to the press. That’s why it will require a hand and tough negotiating if the three member nations of NAFTA do indeed meet to tweak the longstanding agreement in order to salvage the closest international relationship."

A rep for the actor confirmed the news to People. There aren’t many details about the wedding, but Page Six reports the nuptials took place at The Rainbow Room in New York City. For the past couple years, Parsons has noted that he and Spiewak were never in a rush to tie the knot. When asked during a 2015 appearance on “The View” about whether he saw marriage in his future, he said, “I don’t know. I guess I kind of think so.” “So much of my adult life, that wasn’t really a possibility, and I have grown more interested in the idea, and certainly supportive of the notion, and if my [getting] married would help the notion in general, even that would be enough to make me want to do it,” he said. Parsons and Spiewak, a graphic designer, have been together for over 14 years. Last November, the 44-year-old star shared an Instagram photo on the couple’s anniversary and gushed about Spiewak in the caption. “I met this guy (the one with the mic) 14 years ago today and it was the best thing that ever happened to me, no contest,” Parsons wrote. “One of his greatest gifts to me is that he no longer takes me to sing karaoke. Also, I believe this was a selfie with an actual camera, as our phones couldn’t do that back then hahaha! #todd #anniversary.”Congrats to the happy couple!"

Its preserved skin and gut contents are also providing invaluable clues on these extinct creatures.“I’ve been calling this one the Rosetta Stone for armor,” Donald Henderson, curator of dinosaurs at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, told National Geographic.“It’s basically a dinosaur mummy ― it really is exceptional,” Don Brinkman, director of preservation and research, also told The New York Times. For the last five years, researchers have spent more than 7,000 hours chiseling away at the fossil’s surrounding rock to expose the incredible creature.The researchers have had their share of ups and downs, with the fossil breaking into pieces upon its removal from Alberta’s Millennium Mine in 2011.The 15,000-pound, plaster-covered block it was encased in is seen shattering during a video uploaded to YouTube by Suncor Energy, which owns the mine.“One of the good things about this, believe it or not, is because it’s in smaller pieces it will make preparation go a little faster,” Darren Tanke, a paleo technician with the Royal Tyrrell Museum, says in the video.“This is restorable. Everything broke cleanly and in big pieces,” he adds. “It’s unfortunate that this happened but this is restorable.”"

Dr. Travis Bradberry breaks down the special habits that great leaders share.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58efd0891b0000160016b6f3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One of the most popular Dilbert comic strips in the cartoon’s history begins with Dilbert’s boss relaying senior leadership’s explanation for the company’s low profits. In response to his boss, Dilbert asks incredulously, “So they’re saying that profits went up because of great leadership and down because of a weak economy?” To which Dilbert’s boss replies, “These meetings will go faster if you stop putting things in context.”Great leadership is indeed a difficult thing to pin down and understand. You know a great leader when you’re working for one, but even they can have a hard time explaining the specifics of what they do that makes their leadership so effective.Great leaders change us for the better. They see more in us than we see in ourselves, and they help us learn to see it too. They dream big and show us all the great things we can accomplish.Great leadership is dynamic; it melds a variety of unique skills into an integrated whole. Great leadership is also founded in good habits. What follows are the essential habits that exceptional leaders rely on every day. Give them a try and see where they take your leadership skills.1. Effective Communication“The more elaborate our means of communication, the less we communicate.” —Joseph PriestleyCommunication is the real work of leadership. It’s a fundamental element of how leaders accomplish their goals each and every day. You simply can’t become a great leader until you are a great communicator.Great communicators inspire people. They listen. They create a connection with their followers that is real, emotional, and personal, regardless of any physical distance between them. Great communicators forge this connection through an understanding of people and an ability to speak directly to their needs.2. Courage“Courage is the first virtue that makes all other virtues possible.” —AristotlePeople will wait to see if a leader is courageous before they’re willing to follow his or her lead. People need courage in their leaders. They need someone who can make difficult decisions and watch over the good of the group. They need a leader who will stay the course when things get tough. People are far more likely to show courage themselves when their leaders do the same.For the courageous leader adversity is a welcome test. Like a blacksmith’s molding of a red-hot iron, adversity is a trial by fire that refines leaders and sharpens their game. Adversity emboldens courageous leaders and leaves them more committed to their strategic direction.Leaders who lack courage simply toe the company line. They follow the safest path—the path of least resistance—because they’d rather cover their backside than lead.3. Adherence to the Golden Rule +1“The way you see people is the way you treat them, and the way you treat them is what they become.” —Jon Wolfgang von GoetheThe Golden Rule – treat others as you want to be treated – assumes that all people are the same. It assumes that, if you treat your followers the way you would want a leader to treat you, they’ll be happy. It ignores that people are motivated by vastly different things. One person loves public recognition, while another loathes being the center of attention.Great leaders don’t treat people how they themselves want to be treated. Instead, they take the Golden Rule a step further and treat each person as he or she would like to be treated. Great leaders learn what makes people tick, recognize their needs in the moment, and adapt their leadership style accordingly.4. Self-Awareness“It is absurd that a man should rule others, who cannot rule himself.” —Latin ProverbContrary to what Dilbert might have us believe, leaders’ gaps in self-awareness are rarely due to deceitful, Machiavellian motives, or severe character deficits. In most cases, leaders—like everyone else—view themselves in a more favorable light than other people do.Self-awareness is the foundation of emotional intelligence, a skill that 90% of top performing leaders possess in abundance. Great leaders’ high self-awareness means they have a clear and accurate image not just of their leadership style, but also of their own strengths and weaknesses. They know where they shine and where they’re weak, and they have effective strategies for leaning into their strengths and compensating for their weaknesses.5. Passion“If you just work on stuff that you like and are passionate about, you don’t have to have a master plan with how things will play out.” —Mark ZuckerbergPassion and enthusiasm are contagious. So are boredom and apathy. No one wants to work for a boss that’s unexcited about his or her job, or even one who’s just going through the motions. Great leaders are passionate about what they do, and they strive to share that passion with everyone around them.6. Humility“Humility is not thinking less of yourself, it’s thinking of yourself less.” —C.S. LewisGreat leaders are humble. They don’t allow their position of authority to make them feel that they are better than anyone else. As such, they don’t hesitate to jump in and do the dirty work when needed, and they won’t ask their followers to do anything they wouldn’t be willing to do themselves.7. Generosity“A good leader is a person who takes a little more than his share of the blame and a little less than his share of the credit.” —John MaxwellGreat leaders are generous. They share credit and offer enthusiastic praise. They’re as committed to their followers’ success as they are to their own. They want to inspire all of their employees to achieve their personal best – not just because it will make the team more successful, but because they care about each person as an individual.8. Infectiousness“The very essence of leadership is that you have to have a vision. It’s got to be a vision you articulate clearly and forcefully on every occasion. You can’t blow an uncertain trumpet.” —Reverend Theodore HesburghGreat leaders know that having a clear vision isn’t enough. You have to make that vision come alive so that your followers can see it just as clearly as you do. Great leaders do that by telling stories and painting verbal pictures so that everyone can understand not just where they’re going, but what it will look and feel like when they get there. This inspires others to internalize the vision and make it their own.9. Authenticity“Just be who you are and speak from your guts and heart – it’s all a man has.” —Hubert HumphreyAuthenticity refers to being honest in all things – not just what you say and do, but who you are. When you’re authentic, your words and actions align with who you claim to be. Your followers shouldn’t be compelled to spend time trying to figure out if you have ulterior motives. Any time they spend doing so erodes their confidence in you and in their ability to execute.Leaders who are authentic are transparent and forthcoming. They aren’t perfect, but they earn people’s respect by walking their talk.10. Approachability“Management is like holding a dove in your hand. Squeeze too hard and you kill it, not hard enough and it flies away.” —Tommy LasordaGreat leaders make it clear that they welcome challenges, criticism, and viewpoints other than their own. They know that an environment where people are afraid to speak up, offer insight, and ask good questions is destined for failure. By ensuring that they are approachable, great leaders facilitate the flow of great ideas throughout the organization.11. Accountability“The ancient Romans had a tradition: Whenever one of their engineers constructed an arch, as the capstone was hoisted into place, the engineer assumed accountability for his work in the most profound way possible: He stood under the arch.” —Michael ArmstrongGreat leaders have their followers’ backs. They don’t try to shift blame, and they don’t avoid shame when they fail. They’re never afraid to say, “The buck stops here,” and they earn people’s trust by backing them up.12. A Sense Of Purpose“You don’t lead by pointing and telling people some place to go. You lead by going to that place and making a case.” —Ken KeseyWhereas vision is a clear idea of where you’re going, a sense of purpose refers to an understanding of why you’re going there. People like to feel like they’re part of something bigger than themselves. Great leaders give people that feeling.Bringing It All TogetherBecoming a great leader doesn’t mean that you have to incorporate all of these traits at once. Focus on one or two at a time; each incremental improvement will make you more effective. It’s okay if you “act” some of these qualities at first. The more you practice, the more instinctive it will become, and the more you’ll internalize your new leadership style.Please share your thoughts on exceptional leadership in the comments section, as I learn just as much from you as you do from me.Want to learn more from me?

63,BUSINESS,6 Honest Mistakes That Can Get You Fired,"Dr. Travis Bradberry, ContributorTalentSmart, President and 'Emotional Intelligence 2.0,' Coauthor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/6-honest-mistakes-that-can-get-you-fired_us_59135198e4b0e070cad70b1c,"There are so many things that can get good, hard-working people fired. Honest mistakes often carry hard-hitting consequences",2017-05-14,"<p>Even good, hard-working people get fired for these innocent mistakes. Make certain it doesn't happen to you.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591351b11600002900c5a86d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There are so many things that can get good, hard-working people fired. Honest mistakes often carry hard-hitting consequences. A recent study from the ePolicy Institute surveyed more than 300 companies and found that a third of them have fired employees for the misuse of company technology.Companies are so worried about employee abuse of technology that 45% of those surveyed admitted that they track employee technology use (some all the way down to the keystroke), yet only two US states require employers to notify employees when they’re monitoring them.When it comes to reasons for getting fired, digital faux pas steal the spotlight. Every week, it seems, we read about someone getting fired for something they posted on social media.“The real problem is not whether machines think but whether men do.” -B.F. Skinner But digital media is far from the only way that people slip up and lose their jobs. People get fired all the time for seemingly innocent mistakes. While we snicker behind our coffee cups at the more egregious examples, there are still plenty of other ways to get fired that may surprise you.1. Over-promising and under-delivering. You made an implied promise when you accepted your job. You implicitly promised that you were capable of fulfilling all of the job’s responsibilities. Accepting a job when you know you’re not qualified catches up with you. Even when you are qualified, telling your boss you’re making great progress when you aren’t or committing to a deadline you know you can’t meet makes you look bad. Don’t be surprised if you get fired for failing to do everything you said you could do.2. Negativity. You were hired to make your boss’s and your team’s jobs easier, not harder. People who constantly spread negativity through their department, complain about others, and whine that the work’s too hard or isn’t part of their job description complicate things for everyone else. Those who make their boss’s life harder are usually the first ones to go. Having to tiptoe around you so as not to dislodge that massive chip on your shoulder isn’t something he or she is likely to be willing to do for very long.3. Solicitation. Whether you’re sending out e-mails inviting coworkers to your party or hanging up an order form for your child’s school fundraiser, you could be violating company policy. Don’t assume that you’re in the clear just because other people are doing it—this type of policy violation is what managers hang their hats on when they’re unhappy with an employee’s performance.4. A lack of emotional intelligence. Everyone knows that you can get fired for being unable or unwilling to play nicely with others, but what trips up a lot of people is having a poorly developed poker face. If everyone can tell when you’re bored or irritated or that you think something a colleague is saying is stupid, this will catch up with you. Emotional outbursts, belittling others, shutting co-workers down when they speak, and just generally being a jerk are other ways a lack of emotional intelligence will leave you looking for work.5. Misusing company supplies or resources. Many people don't think twice about taking a pack of printer paper home when they’ve run out or using the company’s FedEx account to mail a last-minute holiday gift. However, in the eyes of your employer, this is stealing. Abusing company resources is a serious offense, even if the monetary value of the item doesn’t add up to much. Catching you in the act can also be a good excuse if your boss is looking to fire you. It’s a lot easier to document and justify firing someone for stealing than it is to fire them because they are just okay at their job.6. Speaking on behalf of the company. This isn’t just about sending out an unauthorized press release or venting on the company Twitter account, because most people already realize that these types of things will get them fired. I’m talking about answering a question when a reporter sticks a microphone in your face or identifying yourself as an employee of the company when sharing your personal opinions online. This creates the perception that you’re speaking as a representative of the company, even when you aren’t trying to, and that’s definitely something that can get you fired.Bringing It All TogetherA lot of people make the mistake of thinking that they can only be fired for getting caught making one huge misstep, such as sexually harassing a colleague or bad-mouthing the boss.

64,ENTERTAINMENT,Lawrence O’Donnell’s Future At MSNBC Is Unclear,Yashar Ali,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lawrence-odonnell-msnbc-future_us_59162d8ce4b00f308cf5534a,"As his contract nears its end, a renewal doesn't appear to be on the horizon for ""The Last Word"" host.",2017-05-14,"Andrew Lack (second from left) meets with executives from Microsoft, General Electric and Drugstore.com in Manhattan to announce the creation of MSNBC.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59188da61600002000c5b27b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Lawrence O’Donnell, host of MSNBC’s “The Last Word,” has just four weeks left in his contract, and the cable network does not appear to be interested in renewing his deal. Four well-placed sources tell HuffPost that MSNBC has not been in contact with O’Donnell’s team of representatives to negotiate a new deal.The absence of active negotiations weeks before a contract expires is highly unusual and often a sign that a contract won’t be renewed. News networks normally don’t risk letting the contract of a host who has a highly rated program expire or even come close to expiring before renegotiating. A short time-frame puts the network at a strategic disadvantage in talks, that’s why cable networks often start negotiating renewals six to nine months in advance of a contract ending. A spokesman for NBC News declined to comment on “ongoing negotiations.” Although, multiple sources from inside and outside the network have told HuffPost that no negotiations have taken place. O’Donnell, who has been appearing on the network since its inception, has hosted his highly rated program since the fall of 2010. “The Last Word” is the cable network’s second-highest rated program, according to Nielsen figures, behind only “The Rachel Maddow Show.”O’Donnell has even been, on some nights, besting Sean Hannity’s program on Fox News among viewers ages 18 to 49, the demographic that television advertisers care about the most.If O’Donnell’s contract is not renewed, that would not come as a surprise to many network insiders. Andy Lack, the chairman of NBC News, is no fan of O’Donnell’s program, sources say. Some say it’s because he doesn’t appreciate the liberal nature of “The Last Word,” but others say it’s about the fact that O’Donnell rejected Lack’s request to move his program from 10 p.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern time. This decision was O’Donnell’s prerogative, two sources said, because his contract stipulates that his program must air in prime time. O’Donnell’s refusal to move his program could have led Lack, who is known to bristle at dissent, to sour on O’Donnell, sources said. A senior NBC News executive disagreed with the idea that Lack isn’t a fan of O’Donnell’s show saying, “He is proud of and enthusiastic about all the work that’s being done across all of MSNBC’s primetime slate, including Lawrence’s program.”There does appear to be some evidence of Lack’s distaste. O’Donnell has not had a face-to-face meeting with him since Lack returned to the network in 2015 after stints at Sony Music and Bloomberg Television, two sources said.A senior NBC news executive said that Lack doesn’t take a heavy-handed approach with the cable network’s on-air talent and that frequent face-to-face meetings are often a sign that he isn’t satisfied. Sources familiar with the production of “The Last Word” say that Lack doesn’t interfere with the program’s editorial direction. And in Lack’s previous stint as NBC News president he was the one that pushed for O’Donnell to appear on the then nascent cable MSNBC network when it was founded in 1996. Lack’s programming decisions and leadership style have caused tension internally at MSNBC leading staff members and on-air talent to express their displeasure internally and externally. For this story, HuffPost spoke to more than 10 sources inside and outside the network who asked to remain anonymous because they are not authorized to speak publicly about network business.If O’Donnell’s contract is not renewed, the news would certainly be welcome to President Donald Trump, who has had a long-running feud with O’Donnell.In 2011, O’Donnell called on NBC to fire Trump, then the host and executive producer of “The Celebrity Apprentice,” for pushing his racist and inaccurate “birther” conspiracy against President Barack Obama. In 2015, he also claimed that Trump was lying about his wealth. Trump threatened to sue O’Donnell for making false statements but never followed through on his threat (which O’Donnell had predicted). According to three sources, Trump has pressured MSNBC President Phil Griffin to fire O’Donnell on multiple occasions. Griffin alluded to Trump’s push for O’Donnell’s ouster in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter last month, saying, “[Trump] started calling me all the time in 2011 to say Lawrence O’Donnell was a ‘third-rate’ anchor.” Griffin and O’Donnell enjoy a cordial relationship but Griffin’s power as the President of MSNBC has been diminished by Lack since he returned in 2015. As a result, Lack will be the one to decide whether O’Donnell stays and under what terms. There is a fear, among some at MSNBC, that Lack is making programming decisions in an effort to appease the Trump administration (an accusation that has been made of CNN and Fox News), which may lead to more access to the White House and in turn, conservative viewers. A senior NBC News executive pushed back on this claim. “Is he bringing in more voices from all over the political spectrum? Yes. But that’s to make better programming and more informed analysis. We don’t do things to appease people in power. We hold them accountable.”It’s unclear who would replace O’Donnell if MSNBC declines to renew his contract. Multiple sources have told HuffPost that Brian Williams, whose program, “The 11th Hour,” is on MSNBC at 11 p.m. Eastern, has been eager to have an earlier start in the evening schedule. If MSNBC failed to renew O’Donnell’s contract, it would be unprecedented, given his high ratings, but multiple sources tell HuffPost that Lack attributes O’Donnell’s high-ratings to heightened interest in Trump and the fact that his program’s lead-in is the top-rated Rachel Maddow show, and doesn’t credit O’Donnell’s star power and fan base for the high-ratings. Despite this, Lack is said to dislike when people attribute his cable network’s blockbuster ratings to Trump: He believes, according to multiple sources, that the high ratings are largely a product of his programming decisions. A senior NBC News executive disputes both of these characterizations saying that Lack believes ratings success is more nuanced than attributing it to one or two factors. “He considers prime time to be the “op-ed section” of the cable news network, and believes MSNBC is on top right now because it has the smartest, most insightful and most dynamic opinion hosts in the business,” the executive said.O’Donnell is not giving up on what appears to be his quest to stay at MSNBC. On May 3, he tweeted about “The Last Word” program beating Hannity in the ratings. “We need audience support now more than ever,” O’Donnell replied. “So thanks again.” Friday night, he sent another Twitter message about his rankings. “Last night @maddow was #1 rated show in all of cable tv, not just cable news. @TheLastWord was #2,” he wrote. “Thanks for your support. We need it.”"

Falwell noted more than 50,000 people attended the speech, a record size.When Trump took the microphone, he congratulated the class of 2017, then immediately addressed the crowd size.“I’m thrilled to be back at Liberty University. I’ve been here, this is now my third time, and we love setting records, right? We always set records,” Trump said. “We have to set records, we have no choice.” He referred again to the size of the crowd later in his speech, saying, “This is a beautiful stadium, and it’s packed. I’m so happy about that.”It was the latest example of a seeming obsession with crowd size. After Trump’s inauguration, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer pushed back strongly on reports that the size of the crowd was smaller than the one at President Barack Obama’s in 2009. During a rally in Pennsylvania last month, Trump said he had set an “all time” record for crowd size at an arena, but a journalist attending tweeted a photo of empty seats.Trump, who was presented with an honorary degree but didn’t wear academic regalia during his address, urged the Liberty graduates to remain persistent, never give up and, if necessary, to embrace being an outsider. Trump, who has frequently attacked the press for being critical of him, told graduates they should “turn your hopes and dreams into actions.”“Nothing is easier or more pathetic than being a critic, because they’re people that can’t get the job done,” he said.The president also offered a robust defense of public faith in American life, saying graduates shouldn’t let other people tell them what to believe, “especially when you know that you’re right.”“In America, we don’t worship government, we worship God,” he said. Trump also reprised some of his comic antics from the campaign trail with an extended riff on Liberty’s rising standing in college football. Trump congratulated the Flames, as the school’s team is known, on joining the NCAA’s Division I, where it now plays some of the best teams in the country.“Just wait until the world hears the football teams you’ll be playing on your schedule, starting next season,” the president said. “Would you like me to read the names that just came out, would you like to hear them? I’m a little bit concerned. UMass, Virginia ― Auburn! Jerry, are you sure you know what you’re doing?” Trump said, drawing laughs from the crowd as he turned toward Falwell. “Jerry, Auburn? I don’t know about that, James. This could be trouble, Jerry.” (It is not clear to whom Trump was referring when he said “James.”)Trump, who has bragged about committing adultery and is on his third marriage, has never been a particularly devout Christian. That was evident when he spoke at Liberty University on the campaign trail in January 2016, citing a verse from “Two Corinthians,” a New Testament book that is more commonly called “Second Corinthians.”Days after the 2016 speech, however, Falwell endorsed Trump in the Republican presidential primary, giving him an advantage among social conservatives that competitors, including Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), had hoped to lock down. Among the reasons Falwell cited was Trump’s tendency to “speak his mind.”Falwell, whose father was a towering figure in conservative Republican politics, took Trump’s newly declared commitment to evangelical priorities, such as restricting abortion rights, at face value. (Years earlier, Trump had described himself as pro-abortion rights.)Introducing Trump on Saturday, Falwell praised the president for an executive order this month that would make it easier for religious institutions to get involved in politics without jeopardizing their tax-exempt status. The order stops short of overturning the Johnson Amendment barring churches and other tax-exempt religious entities from openly engaging in politics, but it instructs the Internal Revenue Service to enforce the policy as leniently as possible.Falwell’s closeness with Trump has not always sat well with Liberty University students. In October, about 2,500 Liberty students and faculty members issued a statement denouncing Trump after leaked video emerged of Trump bragging about what appeared to be unwanted groping of women. They also criticized Falwell for dismissing the incident by saying, “We’re all sinners.”"

NASA reports that combined observations from the Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes reveal this planet ― more than 430 light-years from Earth ― has an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium.Orbiting a sun that’s twice as old as our own, HAT-P-26b is approximately the same size as one of our solar system’s outer planets, Neptune, which also has a hydrogen-helium atmosphere. HAT-P-26b is considered a “Warm Neptune” because it orbits its sun more closely than our own Neptune does.According to NASA, “HAT-P-26b’s atmosphere is relatively clear of clouds and has a strong water signature, although the planet is not a water world. This is the best measurement of water to date on an exoplanet of this size.”At the University of Exeter in the U.K., astrophysics professor David Sing is a co-leader of the HAT-P-26b research team, and co-author of a study published May 11 in the journal Science.“This ‘Warm Neptune’ is a much smaller planet than those we have been able to characterize in depth, so this new discovery about its atmosphere feels like a big breakthrough in our pursuit to learn more about how solar systems are formed, and how it compares to our own,” Sing explained in a University of Exeter statement.The following video demonstrates how astronomers discover exoplanets using the transit method. HAT-P-26b study leader Hannah Wakeford, of the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, said the research is important because it changes how scientists think about the birth and evolution of planetary systems.“Astronomers have just begun to investigate the atmospheres of these distant Neptune-mass planets, and almost right away, we found an example that goes against the trend in our solar system,” Wakeford said in a NASA statement.“This kind of unexpected result is why I really love exploring the atmospheres of alien planets.” "

The 31-year-old designer gave Ecco Domani’s Pinot Grigio bottles a colorfully retro, Californian spin just in time for the warmer months. The new designs, which were unveiled Wednesday at The Pavilion in Manhattan’s Union Square, were inspired by midcentury Palm Springs, with opulent flowers and palm branches in pink and purple. “I wanted to create a label design that would make the bottle stand out on the shelf and be this must-have piece for all of summer’s celebrations—whether it’s a big group dinner party or a casual time with friends,” Siriano told HuffPost. “It can spark conversation from just being on the table, and can serve as a piece of décor long after the wine inside is finished.” Calling Palm Springs one of his favorite destinations, he added, “I’m always drawn to the 1960s era, its beautiful textiles and the bold, bright colors that was everywhere from the architecture to the florals... I wanted to represent through this that idea of the romantic, whimsical, at-home soiree.”Though Siriano and his husband, Brad Walsh, maintain busy schedules, the men still find time for date nights ― and wine is usually part of their leisure time. “I tend to go for an Italian Pinot Grigio, I enjoy it on its own but it also goes well with a variety of dishes—especially in the summertime when we often go for light, homemade pastas and salads,” Siriano, who named the Waverly Inn, the Beatrice Inn and the Soho Grand Hotel as among his favorite Manhattan hot spots, said. “Brad is more of a Malbec and Pinot Noir drinker, but he won’t say no to a refreshing glass of white wine!” Take a look at some photos from Ecco Domani’s Pinot Grigio unveiling with Christian Siriano below.

Tom Perriello (D-Va.) in Oct. 2010.

Tom Perriello in Virginia’s hotly contested Democratic gubernatorial primary race.Jarrett made the announcement on Twitter Saturday, praising Perriello’s vote for the Affordable Care Act as a freshman congressman from a conservative district in central Virginia. Perriello went on to lose his reelection bid amid a backlash to the law that fueled a Republican takeover of the House of Representatives.The Perriello campaign confirmed that the tweet represented an official endorsement of his candidacy.Perriello thanked her for the endorsement.Jarrett was a close confidante of Obama’s from Chicago long before he became president. She joined Obama in lobbying Democratic National Committee members to elect former Labor Secretary Tom Perez as chairman in his successful race against Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison in February.As a member of Congress, Perriello distinguished himself for his support of Obama’s agenda despite living in a district that was increasingly hostile to the then-president. He went on to head the Democratic-aligned Center for American Progress action fund and serve in the Obama administration State Department. Jarrett’s use of the phrase “political courage” appears to be a reference to Obama’s speech last week upon accepting the Profile in Courage award at the John F. Kennedy Library on Sunday. He dedicated the award to the Democrats in Congress who lost their elections after voting for the ACA, commonly known as Obamacare.“These men and women did the right thing,” Obama said. “They did the hard thing. Theirs was a profile in courage.” Perriello, 42, is campaigning as a defender of the law in the wake of the recent House vote to repeal the ACA.In an advertisement released moments after the House passed the repeal legislation, Perriello stands in front of an ambulance being crushed in a compactor symbolizing GOP attempts to overturn health reform. Speaking over the loud noise of the compactor, he touts his vote for Obamacare as a congressman and promises to prevent a figurative ambulance-crushing scenario in Virginia.But Perriello’s vote for Obamacare is fraught with controversy as well. He was one of 64 House Democrats to support the Stupak-Pitts Amendment, a measure that would have prohibited Obamacare subsidies from being available for insurance plans that cover abortion. The amendment temporarily held up the landmark law before an alternative compromise replaced it.Since launching his gubernatorial campaign, Perriello has expressed “regret” for the decision to back Stupak-Pitts, claiming it was based on a promise to constituents to oppose federal funding for abortions. He now supports repealing the Hyde Amendment, the law barring federal funding for abortions.The more uniformly pro-abortion rights record of Perriello’s opponent, sitting Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam, 57, earned the endorsement of NARAL Pro-Choice America. Northam, a pediatric neurologist and Army veteran, helped lead the fight against a Republican-led trans-vaginal ultrasound proposal in the Virginia legislature.He has also fought to implement the ACA in Virginia, advocating for the expansion of Medicaid and the creation of a state-run Obamacare insurance exchange.The lieutenant governor is not without his own controversial health policy record, however. He twice voted for former President George W. Bush, a staunchly anti-abortion Republican who appointed two Roe v. Wade opponents to the Supreme Court. (He has said he was not following politics closely at the time.)And as a state senator in 2011, he called health care a “privilege” in a debate with an opponent, even as he defended measures to make it more affordable. (He has since said he believes “affordable health care” is a “right.”)Notwithstanding these complexities, Jarrett’s endorsement is a significant pickup for Perriello, who has cast himself as the progressive favorite in the contentious primary. Northam has the support of virtually the entire Democratic establishment in Virginia, including Gov. Terry Mcauliffe, and Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine.He was viewed as a shoo-in until Perriello jumped into the race in January in a move inspired by President Donald Trump’s election. Perriello has since picked up endorsements from top progressive leaders such as Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), along with Our Revolution, the nonprofit successor to Sanders’ presidential campaign. Perriello and Northam are now neck-in-neck in the polls ahead of the June 13 primary.The general election is Nov. 7. The current frontrunner in the Republican primary is Ed Gillespie, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee.This article has been updated throughout."

Not to mention, the Trump administration’s explanation for Comey’s highly unusual dismissal unravelled fairly quickly.So, when the German embassy in Washington offered a bit of interestingly timed insight on Friday, a lot of people believed it was subtweeting America and throwing some major shade.“Ever experienced pleasure from someone’s misfortune?” the embassy tweeted Friday afternoon. “There’s a #German word for that: Schadenfreude!”The embassy’s tweet included a link to its official website, with a blog post that contains a more detailed definition of schadenfreude.“Do you wish the best for everyone ― even your enemies? Or do you gain pleasure from watching someone fail?” the article, penned by German embassy writer Nicole Glass, reads.“Most of you would probably never admit to feeling Schadenfreude,” Glass continues. “But be honest: do feelings of Schadenfreude creep up on you when they’re related to someone who wronged you in the past?”To be fair, the embassy’s schadenfreude reference could be completely innocuous. Nowhere in the tweet does the embassy mention Trump or Comey, nor does it make any political reference. The tweet appears to be part of the embassy’s weekly social media campaign #WordOfTheWeek, which shares German words and their definitions.For example, last week’s German word of the day was much friendlier: zweisamkeit, defined as “a very intimate, harmonious togetherness without anyone else being in the picture.”Still, some people assumed Friday’s tweet was the German embassy’s attempt at trolling the Trump administration. With all the crazy news lately, it’s hard to blame them."

Clark is also a buffalo ― that’s what makes them a good match, he says.In other ways, they’re a surprising pair: Clark first came to Da Nang in 1968 as a 19-year-old Marine fighting in the Vietnam War. He returned to the country four decades later to see what had become of it. He met Ushi, who is Vietnamese, a few years later at a restaurant she owns in the town of Hue.He remembers she was wearing a chartreuse dress, with long earrings and a watch to match. They later danced in the street as Ushi’s favorite song ― the Beatles’ “Eight Days a Week” ― played at a festival.The two fell in love and married in a Catholic church while wearing traditional Vietnamese wedding clothes. Later, they bought a house near the beach in Da Nang and remodeled it to add some Western elements, including a filter that lets them drink straight from the kitchen sink. On a warm night this spring, with the sounds of karaoke wafting through the streets from nearby bars and restaurants, Clark’s house offered another example of worlds colliding. A group that in the late 1960s wouldn’t have been caught under the same roof ― let alone sharing an appetizer of deep-fried Vietnamese spring rolls ― gathered around a large kitchen table.The guests included Floyd Henderson, a Vietnam War draft dodger who fled to Canada in 1969; Cathy Wilkerson, a former member of the militant Weather Underground group who landed on the FBI’s “10 Most Wanted” list; and Chuck Searcy, who also served in the Vietnam War and has since returned to live in Hanoi.Searcy is also the vice president of the Vietnamese chapter of Veterans for Peace, an anti-war nonprofit. Through the organization, he leads tours of the country geared toward Vietnam War veterans and activists, but anyone is welcome to join. That’s what brought the unlikely group together at that kitchen table ― it was the 12th day of their trip from Hanoi to Saigon.For some, going back to Vietnam is a way to make peace with the past. For others, the trip is a chance to connect with a place and a cause that still matters deeply to them.War tourism isn’t a new concept, and veterans have been returning to Vietnam for years. But Searcy says he probably won’t keep hosting his tour. The affected generation is aging, and it’s difficult to get enough interest in the trips to justify them. Ten people traveled with him this year; usually about 15 people join.Searcy was stationed in Saigon from 1967 to 1968 as part of an intelligence battalion. He returned to the country for the first time in 1992, and moved there three years later to take a job at a nonprofit in Hanoi. His tour takes a little over two weeks. It costs $2,750, plus airfare, and participants are asked to bring a gift of $1,000. At the end of the journey, they decide together how to donate the money. Clark has been on the board of Vietnam’s Veterans for Peace chapter for several years, which is how he met Searcy. He describes Searcy in military terms: a point man leading others to learn how to make amends for the United States’ role in the war.Clark has taken part in a few of Searcy’s trips, but this is his first year hosting a dinner and welcoming people on the tour into his home.“If you had told me 40 years ago that I’d be here in Vietnam, I’d have said you’re full of shit as a turkey ― a Christmas turkey,” he said. “I came here in 1968 to die for my country. Thank God I didn’t. You know what’s the greatest gift I have? I get to die here of my own choice.”For Wilkerson, the 2017 trip was a chance to complete a journey she started 50 years ago.In 1967, she and three other members of Students for a Democratic Society flew from the U.S. to Cambodia by way of Paris. Their goal was to make their way to meet with the Viet Cong in North Vietnam and bring back information to help their anti-war efforts in the U.S. It was a bloody year in the Vietnam War, and Hanoi wasn’t accessible by a commercial flight. But the activists planned to hitch a ride on a mail plane that made a daily trip to the city because an international agreement dictated that it wouldn’t be shot down, Wilkerson said.They never made it across the border. The U.S. had started bombing the northern city, and the North Vietnamese decided it was too dangerous for the students to make the trip. So the North Vietnamese met them in Phnom Penh for four days of meetings and discussion.Wilkerson caught the attention of national news ― and the FBI ― when her father’s New York City townhouse, where she and other activists had been building a nail bomb, exploded in 1970. Three people died in the incident, and Wilkerson spent the next decade evading authorities by working minimum-wage jobs without an ID. She surrendered to law enforcement in 1980 and spent 11 months in prison.Wilkerson is petite and shy, with silver-framed glasses. Her outward appearance doesn’t match with the ‘60s radical who got caught up in a group advocating for an “armed struggle” against the U.S. government. But she still describes herself as an activist.The events leading up to the townhouse explosion were “ill-advised,” Wilkerson said. But even as she grew older, she maintained an interest in Vietnam. Floyd Henderson describes how he feels today about his choice to flee to Canada instead of being drafted into the Vietnam War. Listen above.Henderson joined Searcy’s trip for the first time in 2014. Forty-five years earlier, he’d received a bench warrant for his arrest after ignoring several draft notices. When his brother threatened to turn him into the FBI, Henderson took the $700 he had in his sock drawer and spent $250 of it on a Buick. He packed his typewriter, guitars and other possessions and drove with a friend to International Falls, Minnesota. Henderson had no intention of coming back once they crossed into Canada. “I didn’t want to kill ― I had no desire whatsoever to shoot another human being for any reason,” he said.Although he’d made it across the border, he didn’t have a legal right to be in the country permanently. “I spent that winter living pretty much on the street,” he said.Henderson later secured a legal right to be in Canada, but eventually returned to the U.S. after President Jimmy Carter pardoned draft dodgers.Henderson is gentle and thoughtful when he speaks. He has spent a great deal of time considering his choice to flee the U.S. in 1969 while so many others were getting drafted. “Sometimes it’s an almost constant ― regret might not be the right word for it, though it’s probably the closest I can come to it ― that I did not go to Vietnam.”He’d make the same decision again, he noted. But still, he struggles with what he described as “survivor guilt.” That feeling was what originally brought him on Searcy’s tour in 2014. That group included many combat veterans, which made Henderson nervous. “I went with a huge amount of trepidation because I wasn’t sure what kind of reaction I was going to get from these guys,” he said.He was surprised at the response he received. “Without a single hesitation, they accepted me as one of them,” he said. “Even going so far as to call me a veteran and one of their brothers.”He joined the trip again this time for another chance to see the country.Clark joined the United States Marine Corps on his 17th birthday. On a warm day in March at the hotel where Searcy’s group was staying, he recounted arriving in Vietnam for the first time. He couldn’t legally vote or drink in his hometown, but here, he could carry a gun. He remembers that vividly.It was a court-martial offense to leave the compound without a weapon, so Clark always had his M16 and rounds with him. And when he encountered a Vietnamese person, he remembers what he’d do.“Every time I came across the Vietnamese ― I didn’t care if it was a man, woman or a child ― I would point that M16 in their face. And I wanted them to fear me. Because I felt if they feared me my chances of going home were much, much better,” Clark said. Clark was outwardly successful in the U.S. after the war, but he struggled emotionally to come to terms with his experiences. He couldn’t forget that look of fear he’d put in people’s faces. Or the battles where he’d shoot into the fray, not knowing whom or what he might be hitting. Certain dates or moments that were meaningless to others would trigger terrible memories of the war.In 2007, a friend who had been in the Air Force suggested Clark try going back to Vietnam. So he went for it. He landed in Saigon and was waiting nervously at immigration when the humidity hit him, then the smell ― and then he saw people. The memories came right back. He wanted to turn around.But he didn’t. In fact, the trip turned out to be a positive experience. He couldn’t believe how welcoming the Vietnamese people were. He visited several other times, and in 2013, he returned to stay for a year.He hasn’t left since.Clark likes to visit the Marble Mountains outside Da Nang, which he used to climb when he was stationed here. He watches the sunrise and looks out over the landscape ― sometimes it’s cloudy, sometimes it’s rainy. But the sun always comes up.“When I’m in the United States, the American war in Vietnam haunts me every day and every night. I see many sights, and I see those faces,” he said. “But when I’m in Vietnam and I’m on the top of Marble Mountain and I’m looking around and I don’t see no flares, no tracers, no choppers, no gunfire, no artillery fire, no rounds going over your head ― the American war was over 40 years ago. They’re at peace here. And I find peace here.”David talks about how living in Vietnam has helped him come to terms with his experiences from the war. Listen above.As everyone sat around the big kitchen table enjoying Ushi’s homemade yogurt for dessert, Clark offered guests glasses of Johnnie Walker Red Label scotch. He gave one to George Mische, another participant on the trip. Mische burned draft cards with homemade napalm in 1968 as part of the Catholic group that became known as the “Catonsville Nine.”Searcy told the group his story of first returning to Vietnam after the war, describing how he panicked as his plane approached the Saigon airport.His anxiety was so intense that he would have turned the plane around, he said. But he couldn’t. The group listened, smiling and nodding over their shared history. As the evening drew to a close, Searcy’s tour participants bid goodbye to their hosts. They got back on a bus and made their way to their hotel. The next morning they’d eat warm, salty fried rice or pho, a traditional Vietnamese soup, at the hotel breakfast buffet before heading to the airport. From there, they’d fly south to Saigon.Clark left the house and walked down dark, warm streets to one of his favorite local cafes. He smoked thuoc lao, a Vietnamese tobacco, out of a water pipe, the bubbles gurgling. Motorbikes hummed along past the café, and he greeted the two children inside the shop. It’s his favorite place in the city, he said.Heading back home afterward, he called “hello, hello” to the Vietnamese people he passed. They smiled and waved back."

Clark is also a buffalo ― that’s what makes them a good match, he says.In other ways, they’re a surprising pair: Clark first came to Da Nang in 1968 as a 19-year-old Marine fighting in the Vietnam War. He returned to the country four decades later to see what had become of it. He met Ushi, who is Vietnamese, a few years later at a restaurant she owns in the town of Hue.He remembers she was wearing a chartreuse dress, with long earrings and a watch to match. They later danced in the street as Ushi’s favorite song ― the Beatles’ “Eight Days a Week” ― played at a festival.The two fell in love and married in a Catholic church while wearing traditional Vietnamese wedding clothes. Later, they bought a house near the beach in Da Nang and remodeled it to add some Western elements, including a filter that lets them drink straight from the kitchen sink. On a warm night this spring, with the sounds of karaoke wafting through the streets from nearby bars and restaurants, Clark’s house offered another example of worlds colliding.

After being introduced",2017-05-13,<p>DJ Cassidy’s new single “Honor” features Australian singer Grace and rapper Lil Yachty.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59166b721e00003b00622d10.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"“It’s usually a process to get the lightning to strike,” said DJ Cassidy of writing a hit record, “But every now and then, you get a track that elicits something special out of everyone's mouth.”New single “Honor” is a perfect example, DJ Cassidy said during an exclusive interview with Party Foul Radio with Pollo & Pearl. Crafting a catchy song was not the problem in this case – lyricist Whitney Phillips had already done that, he stated – it was finding the right talents to sing it.“Whitney sang it with such conviction, and she has such a great voice – such a unique voice,” Cassidy told Podomatic’s No. 1 LGBT Podcast, “It was hard to think of someone singing it as powerfully as she.”To find the perfect vocalist, DJ Cassidy turned to his ongoing “Wish List” of potential collaborators. “Some are superstars” -- Bruno Mars, Justin Timberlake and The Weeknd -- Cassidy shared, while other artists are just beginning their careers. Australian star Grace was near the top.“When I heard her cover of ‘You Don’t Own Me,’ which was her big hit a year or so ago, I was completely blown away,” shared DJ Cassidy, who was himself discovered by Sean “Diddy” Combs as an 18-year-old undergrad spinning records in New York. “She’s 19-years-old and has such a soulful voice, such a powerful voice,” the growing fashion icon continued to rave about Grace. “I knew right then I wanted to work with her.”A “very humble” Grace was excited to “try” her hand on the track – “So many artists are over-confident, but she wanted to try it,” DJ Cassidy said – and came through “with flying colors.” Next, the producer wanted a response from the “male teenage perspective,” “through the sound of hip-hop.” For that, he tapped rising rap trendsetter Lil Yachty.“I was immediately drawn to Yachty from the first time I saw him,” Cassidy said. “Stylistically, we have a lot in common. Like me, he’s bold. He’s bright. He’s vivid. He’s playful, and that’s rare these days.” WATCH: DJ Cassidy “Honor” - Feat. Grace & Lil YachtyHaving never met the rapper, DJ Cassidy approached Yachty backstage after a show in Philly. The two instantly bonded over a vintage broach the producer was wearing; the youngster soon agreed to be on the track.“I knew people would be shocked that Lil Yachty and DJ Cassidy were on a record together – and they were shocked,” the producer said. “They couldn’t understand our common ground.”The night of their meeting, Cassidy took Yachty to a nearby recording studio, which he had already rented. There, Yachty listened to Grace’s vocals and laid down his own.“I think Yachty showed a new side of himself on this record,” DJ Cassidy opined.“In so much of male music – not today, for decades – there’s so much bravado,” he shared about Yachty’s sweet verse on the song. “It’s inspiring to hear a male artist, particularly a young male artist, be humble and ask forgiveness.”As would be expected of a DJ Cassidy production, “Honor” is filled with live instrumentation and elaborate orchestration. Since the launch of his career, whether spinning records at high profile private parties or making music of his own, he has become known for incorporating legendary musicians from the late-‘70s and early-‘80s.“By no means is it all I play,” Cassidy said of his DJ sets, “But I always find a way to infuse a little of it – and more importantly the spirit of it – no matter where I’m playing or who I’m playing for.”The same could be said of his own music. On “Calling All Hearts,” DJ Cassidy’s collaboration with Robin Thicke and Jessie J, iconic Nile Rodgers uses the same guitar he played in Chic’s “Good Times” and Sister Sledge classic “We Are Family.” For “Make the World Go ‘Round,” recorded with R. Kelly, he tapped Ngudu Chancler, who played drums on Michael Jackson’s “Billie Jean.”WATCH: DJ Cassidy + Alex Newell “Kill the Lights”Perhaps no collaboration is a greater nod to the era than “Kill the Lights,” recorded with Alex Newell. After being introduced to the out GLEE favorite by an industry colleague, DJ Cassidy immediately knew the direction he wanted to take their pairing. “I wanted to produce a song for Alex that would allude to the spirit of Sylvester,” Cassidy said. Like the late gay icon, whose enduring hits include favorite “Mighty Real,” Newell has a soaring voice and over-the-top personality.“His voice is incredible,” DJ Cassidy said of the actor who first gained fame playing transgender “Unique” on the Fox teen dramedy. “It’s one of the best voices of his generation.”DJ Cassidy and Newell recorded “Kill the Lights” featuring Rodgers on guitar, but as both had recently released singles, no release date was set. The time came more quickly than expected, Cassidy admitted, thanks to HBO series Vinyl.“Atlantic [Records] was putting out the soundtrack for Vinyl, so they were looking to fill this part of the script where they were discovering this new music which eventually went on to be called ‘disco,’” he shared. When executive producers Martin Scorsese and Mick Jagger heard a demo of “Kill the Lights,” they insisted it be part of the series. Eventually, three episodes of the show revolved around the production.“We had it on the backburner, waiting for the time to be right but the show made it all come together,” said DJ Cassidy of the 2016 release. As for Newell, who appears in something close to full drag in the song’s official video, he has nothing but glowing reviews. “He’s going to be a superstar, there is no doubt in my mind,” DJ Cassidy concluded, “There are few voices like his in every generation. I feel lucky to have worked with him so early in his career.”LISTEN: DJ Cassidy Feat.

Sessions was presented with an award 'honoring his support of law enforcement' by the Sergeants Benevolent Association of New York City during the event, but did not comment on recent events surrounding the firing of FBI Director James Comey. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591738271e00002800622da6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions is set to aggressively resurrect and intensify the War on Drugs and a dozen of state legislative bodies are introducing new legislation criminalizing protest. This moment of increased criminalization, especially in the Trump Era, heightens the need to look back at history for lessons in liberation.On the long road to abolition, Black people did everything they could to get free. Our people literally packaged themselves up in boxes and mailed their way to freedom. With the help of our free family members and allies, we coordinated networks of safe houses to shelter runaways who risked all for the promise of freedom. We harnessed our collective resources to provide shelter, food, employment and opportunity to those who escaped. Our Black ancestors exhausted their bodies and exercised their ingenuity to scrape together every cent available, and when possible, bought their own freedom and the freedom of their loved ones. Until slavery was abolished, Black people fought for their freedom by any means necessary. These countless acts of rebellion, resistance and love have gone largely untold.Today, on our long road to abolition, organizers and communities are taking heed from the lessons of our enslaved ancestors. We are organizing ourselves to liberate our mothers, sisters, daughters and loved ones living in modern bondage. The criminal legal system, like the system of chattel slavery, robs of us our humanity, trading us and caging us for dollars and cents. Money bail, or the requirement that people pay money to not be kept in jail while waiting for their cases to be resolved, condemns tens of thousands of people to cages everyday—not because they have been found guilty of any crime, but because they have been targeted and are now trapped in a system that they cannot afford to buy their way out of.The week before Mother’s Day, organizations in dozens of cities across the country are coordinated to bail out as many mothers as possible. We are fundraising for Mama’s Bail Out Day, to ensure at least some of our people can spend Mother’s Day at home with their families, where they belong.Since 1980, the number of incarcerated women grew 700 percent. Fed by a War on Drugs, that targeted Black and brown communities, and increasingly punitive policing and prosecution practices, millions of women have been taken from their families. Black women are more than twice as likely to be incarcerated as white women and are caged mostly for minor drug offenses or “quality of life” crimes. Transgender women are especially vulnerable to being incarcerated and once incarcerated 40 percent are sexually assaulted.More than 90,000 of the over 111,000, or nearly 80%, of incarcerated women are mothers. They are women responsible for families, chosen and biological. They are the backbones of their neighborhoods, church families, and ball communities. They are grandmothers tirelessly raising their grandbabies. They nourish and sustain our communities. When they are in crisis our whole community is in crisis. When they are forced into cages, instead of being supported, our communities crumble. The criminalization of our mothers, birth and otherwise, is a residual effect of slavery. As Michelle Alexander points out in The New Jim Crow, mass incarceration and criminalization reincarnate pre-Civil War slavery and post-Civil War Jim Crow laws. Like slavery, these regimes maintain and perpetuate a racial caste system that forces our people into poverty, rob them of their freedom and profit from their desperation.Following the Civil Rights Movement and with the onset of the War on Drugs, states and municipalities passed new laws criminalizing formerly noncriminal behavior, allowing police to arrest people for everything from breaches of minor school policies to violations of park rules. These laws greatly increased criminal penalties for drug use and resulted in the criminalization of poverty and mental illness. “Quality of life” and low-level offenses, like all of our criminal laws, are disproportionately enforced against Black and brown people. In New York City more than 80% of those charged with minor offenses or violations are Black or Latinx. Across the country, Black people are nearly four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana, despite smoking it at about the same rate or less.With escalating criminalization came increasingly high bail prices and an increasingly aggressive bail bond industry that entangled families in webs of debt and exploitation.Many of us organizing the Mama’s Bail Out Day are at the frontlines of the fight to end modern-day bondage, starting with the corrupt money bail system. We are pressuring district attorneys to stop asking for exorbitant bails. We are working to pass local legislation that would end the use of money bail for misdemeanors. We are pushing for decriminalization of “quality of life” offenses. We are advocating for state wide reform legislation. In our fight against the bail industry and politicians, we are told constantly to be patient. However, we cannot sit by idly while people’s lives are being destroyed by this cruel, unjust system. We know that thousands of our people are languishing in cages simply because they cannot afford to pay bail.We can wait no longer. This Mother’s Day, in the tradition of our ancestors and in the pursuit of freedom, we are leveraging our resources to buy our freedom. Until money bail is abolished, we have no choice but to galvanize our communities and allies and free ourselves. We hope you will join us."
77,POLITICS,She's The Best Answer To Donald Trump You Never Heard Of,David Wood,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/heather-booth-trump-protest_us_5914820ce4b00b643ebc1531,Angry? Worried? Disillusioned? Heather Booth wants you.,2017-05-13,"In September 2013, Heather Booth (far right) was one of more than 100 immigration rights protesters arrested after scores of them blocked traffic near the U.S. Capitol.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59149f651600001a22c5abe5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Heather Booth doesn’t look like a revolutionary. She sits demurely on a sofa, dressed simply in black, fingering a silver necklace. She speaks softly, selecting her words with care and enunciating cleanly. Dignity. Respect. Community.But something comes over her when she begins to talk about helping people organize to make their world better. The sweet smile fades. She sits up straighter. Her voice tightens, the words come faster. Power. Together. Act. She strikes a gently curled fist into an open palm. IM-pact.Booth, 71, is one of the nation’s most influential organizers for progressive causes. Inside almost every liberal drive over the past five decades ― for fair pay, equal justice, abortion rights, workers’ rights, voter rights, civil rights, immigration rights, child care ― you will find Booth. But you may have to look hard.Because she’s not always at the head of the protest march. More often, she’s at a let’s-get-organized meeting in a suburban church basement or a late-night strategy session in a crumbling neighborhood’s community center. She’s helping people already roused to action figure out practical ways to move their cause forward. And always she’s advancing the credo she learned as a child: that you must not only treat people with dignity and respect, but you must shoulder your own responsibility to help build a society that reflects those values.Booth is the founder and president of the Midwest Academy, which for over four decades has trained grassroots activists to advance progressive causes across the country. The academy’s goal, according to its website, is both aspirational ― to “give people a sense of their own power to improve society” ― and enormously practical ― to teach a “strategic, rigorous, results-oriented approach to social action.”To that end, Booth has worked with a range of liberal groups, from USAction, MoveOn, People’s Action, NAACP National Voter Fund, Alliance for Citizenship and the Voter Participation Center, to the National Organization for Women, the National Council of La Raza, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, and the Center for Community Change. (She’s also blogged for HuffPost.)“Heather is one of the people who makes this all work,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), indicating a sweep of progressive issues ― including the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.Warren, then a Harvard law professor, had a vision of that federal consumer agency in 2007. But she confessed to a colleague that she had no idea how to make it happen, how to harness the political energy needed to push it past the opposition of powerful corporate financial interests.Her colleague said simply, “Call Heather.”So it was that, deep in the financial crisis of 2008, with Wall Street giants collapsing, mortgaged homes going under water and banks facing insolvency, throngs of activists appeared to demand real financial reform. They were drawn from labor unions, civil rights organizations, consumer and citizen action groups, and unaffiliated individuals who had never before been politically active but who were furious at the abuse of ordinary Americans.Booth’s work wasn’t simply a matter of gathering people for protest marches, although those were important. She helped activists devise the tactics to pressure specific legislators. Together they faced off against the monied interests of big business and the political bosses.And they succeeded. In 2010, President Barack Obama signed the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau into law. Politicians and other notable figures gathered on stage for a gala signing ceremony at the Ronald Reagan Building. Booth was in the back of the auditorium.But she felt vindicated. In the fight against Goliath, Booth later told Bill Moyers with a disarming smile, “Sometimes David wins.”Warren said, “I’m in awe.’’Today, opposition to the actions and conduct of President Donald Trump keeps rolling out in the street and on social media. The ugly firing of FBI Director James Comey has ignited new outrage. But the question is whether all that energy can be harnessed for action beyond protest marches ― or if it will dissipate like the 2011 Occupy Wall Street movement.That’s where Booth comes in.The Trump era “is a perilous and inspiring time ― both are true,” she told HuffPost. “The peril can’t be overstated. I do think families will be ripped apart, people will unjustly be imprisoned, jobs will be destroyed. I think lives may be destroyed,” she said. “I fear for unjustified wars. I think the structure of democracy itself will be threatened, from simple protections of people’s health and safety to the ability to live a decent life. So ... a time of great peril.”“But ...” She allowed herself a broad smile, offering a glimpse of the spirit that has powered uphill battles all these years. “I am incredibly heartened by the outpouring of people standing up to say, ‘You’re not going to do this. We are going to defend our lives, our families. Our democracy! And we are going to defend each other.’”“If you stand together and organize,” Booth said, “you can change the world.”This conviction goes way back. In the early 1950s, the sole African-American child in her first-grade class in Brooklyn, New York ― a boy named Benjamin ― was accused by a white student of having stolen her lunch money. The accuser and her friends crowded around Benjamin, pointing and taunting. Booth pushed her way into the circle, put her arm around Benjamin and just stood with him. (And, of course, the accuser then found her lunch money in her shoe.)As an adolescent, Booth felt she didn’t fit in. She tried out for the cheerleading squad, but quit when she found out that more talented black girls had been turned away. She volunteered for the school chorus, but apparently had no aptitude for singing. At the Christmas pageant, she was asked to just silently mouth the words.“I was insecure most of my life,” she said, “and in almost all situations felt I was not good enough, didn’t know enough.”Even so, one day in her early teens, the would-be activist stood by herself in New York City’s Times Square handing out leaflets urging an end to the death penalty. It wasn’t pleasant. In the late 1950s, Times Square was a vile pit of hucksters, porn shops and addicts. One guy spit on her. Flustered, she kept dropping her leaflets. “I was really frightened,” she said.The lesson she took from that experience, however, wasn’t that you had to stop protesting, but that you had to stop doing it alone. You had to draw others into the action. Get organized. Together you could achieve results even if you were scared and insecure.Booth felt that power a few years later in Mississippi, where as a University of Chicago student, she spent the Freedom Summer of 1964 organizing for voter rights. That, too, was frightening and inspiring. “We were standing for something that mattered, that was bigger than ourselves, and if as an individual I didn’t know what I was doing, as a group we did know what we were doing,” she said. “And over time I could see that because of this, we were ending segregation.”Some years later, as a young mother of toddlers on Chicago’s South Side, Booth gathered a group of working moms to form a neighborhood day care cooperative ― and found the idea blocked by the city’s byzantine licensing codes. So they began organizing other parents across the city, at church and synagogue meetings and other community forums.“People flocked to us,” Booth recalled in a recent TEDx talk. “People gained confidence, found their voice, spoke about their love for their kids, the child care they needed, their vision for the future.”They framed the conflict as loving mothers versus uncaring bureaucrats. The press noticed. Then Chicago’s politicians noticed. Within six months, she said the city had agreed to one-stop licensing, a licensing review board of parents and child care providers, and $1 million for new child care centers.The potency of targeted, strategic organizing is a key idea taught at the Midwest Academy, which Booth started in 1973. She chose the name not for the academy’s location, Chicago, but because it sounded wholesome, a clean break from the strident rhetoric of the student left. “We didn’t want to be mean,” she explained.Three core ideas guide the 25,000 activists who have trained at the academy: The goal of organizing must be concrete improvement in people’s lives. The organizing must help ordinary people develop their own sense of power. And activists should seek change that is systemic ― not just fixing the water supply in Flint, but giving people in Flint some oversight of the water system.Among the academy’s teaching materials is a strategic planning chart to help organizers link a specific and achievable goal with available resources (money, allies, media contacts), the names of decision-makers whose support or acquiescence is needed, the tactics required to win over opponents, and the messaging to mobilize others to join in.“Rather than saying, ‘Oh, this is awful, they’re giving money to the wealthiest and taking away our fundamental services, so let’s do a hands-around-the-Capitol’ ― well, that may be a good thing to do,” Booth said. “But can we do it in a way that builds our organization’s resources, brings in more people, maybe raises funds? And afterwards, let’s look at what worked and what didn’t work. What do we do next?”As valuable as organizing is, Booth understands that it’s a tool for social progress, not the driving force behind it.“It doesn’t start with training, although the training helps people be more effective,” she said. “It starts where there is an injustice in the world ― people living in fear that some family member will be deported who’s been here 20 years. And people say, ‘We need to do something about that. Let’s take some action.’”After a police officer killed black teen Michael Brown, for instance, “there was an outpouring across the country. No one had to be told, ‘I can’t take it anymore.’ Not just ‘I can’t,’ but ‘we can’t.’ So it starts with people’s anger, love, fear, hate, concern and standing up to say, ‘It can’t continue like this.’”Today, at a time when many feel powerless and despairing, Booth draws inspiration and energy from the protests that have been erupting since Trump’s inauguration. “We are gaining strength,” she observed.“The size, the numbers, the beauty of the effort, how representative it is of America ― all of America ― the number of places it’s happening. And how beautifully nonviolent, peaceful and intense they are simultaneously.”"

Human rights activist Karla Avelar has been forced to move home six times in the last two years after being physically threatened by individuals she believes are gang members and for her work as a human rights defender in El Salvador.She’s a leading advocate for the human rights of LGBT people, founder and head of COMCAVIS TRANS, an organization known for its work for transgender people for nearly a decade. It’s dangerous, unpopular work, and Avelar is regularly targeted and threatened.A couple of weeks ago she was forced to move home when people tried to extort from her possible prize money for the Martin Ennals Human Rights Defender Award, for which she is a finalist. The award’s winner will be decided and announced in October, but news of her nomination has prompted these latest threats.It hasn’t been an easy life. She was shot in two separate incidents, spent five traumatic years in jail and has been a constant target of abuse for being a transgender woman. Avelar told my colleague Mariel Perez-Santiago at her office in San Salvador last year how she had been raped by more than a hundred men on her first day in prison, and that the attacks continued with the complicity of prison staff.She became a formidable advocate for the rights of trans people in and out of prison, helping to win important reforms in the prison where she used to be an inmate. Thanks to her campaigning, transgender women are now separated from men in different wards, and human rights organizations are allowed access to the prisoners to educate them about their rights. She also represented El Salvador’s LGBT civil society at the country’s 2014 Universal Periodic Review at the United Nations in Geneva.Her advocacy has led to international recognition including becoming a finalist for this year’s Martin Ennals Award. “Transgender persons, and the wider LGBT community, face widespread hostility and social rejection in El Salvador,” said the Martin Ennals organization in a statement. “Crimes against them are almost never brought to justice, which results in a climate of impunity. Sadly, this treatment of transgender people can be seen well beyond El Salvador. We aim to highlight Ms. Avelar’s bravery in continuing her work. We are encouraged that the authorities contacted her after the media coverage of the latest threats. This needs to be followed up with judicial proceedings against those responsible and, most importantly, effective protection for Karla Avelar.”Her profile has meant that the threats against her are receiving attention, and the Attorney General’s office has been in touch with her to discuss issues of her safety. But for Avelar and others in El Salvador’s LGBT community the risks are daily and grave. She estimates around 600 cases of unsolved murders of LGBT people in the country over the last 25 years.“Sadly, these most recent threats against me are not surprising and are part of a broader and systematic pattern of persecution of members of the LGBT community in El Salvador,” said Avelar. “I will not be silenced by these threats, but the Salvadoran government must guarantee my safety and that of all human rights defenders and activists, who work tirelessly to monitor and urge respect for the human rights of the most vulnerable.”Forced to leave her home again and again, she’s asking for protection as well as international visibility. Making her more famous won’t guarantee her safety but we can try to help by sharing her story with whoever we know, by showing that we’re watching, and by saying that she should be protected and never be forced to move again."

Beck made him the offer after O’Reilly applauded him for starting his own media company, which allowed him to control “his own destiny, unlike me.” “Well, I thank you for that, Bill, and I would like to say publicly, honestly — and I know you’re not going to get into this, so just shut the fat trap — it’s why I would like you to work for TheBlaze,” Beck said.“Because I could not get the cable coverage by myself because I’m not powerful enough, unless you have a giant corporation behind you. And when you have that, then you’re beholden to somebody. But if we could unite our powers for good, as opposed to evil — but that’s another conversation.” O’Reilly left Fox News in April after dozens of advertisers said they would no longer advertise on “The O’Reilly Factor” as a result of a growing number of allegations that O’Reilly mistreated and sexually harassed female employees at the company. On Beck’s show, O’Reilly described the events that led to his dismissal as a “hit job” performed by liberal activists. “It really has to do with destroying voices that the far-left doesn’t like,” he said. He then added that he hopes to lay out at a future date exactly who caused his exclusion and how the did it. “There’s going to be an exposition soon, but I can’t tell you when, about who exactly this crew is that terrorizes sponsors, threatens people behind the scenes, that pays people to say things,” O’Reilly said. “We’re going to name them, and it will be a big story. The left-wing media will downplay the story, but it’s coming. Unfortunately, I was target No. 1. It’s sad for me, for my family and it’s grossly dishonest.”He added, “From now on when I’m attacked, I’ll take legal action.”"

Jeff Sessions passed through the cafeteria in a Senate office building to buy lunch. The Alabama Republican was slated to become the attorney general under President Donald Trump and help lead an immigration crackdown. Having railed for years against undocumented immigrants, Sessions signaled a new hard-line approach to deportations in the Trump era. The Senate cashier who rang up Sessions that day was a 26-year-old mother of three from El Salvador, Ana Gomez Ramirez. She is a so-called Dreamer: a young immigrant who came to the country as an undocumented child. She recognized Sessions and knew how he felt about people like her who had entered the country illegally. The soft-spoken Gomez Ramirez greeted him with a hello. Sessions politely asked her how she was doing. “He was nice,” Gomez Ramirez recalled after a recent shift. “Even though he doesn’t want us here.”Like hundreds of thousands of other Dreamers, Gomez Ramirez received a temporary work permit and a reprieve from deportation under President Barack Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. As a DACA recipient, she has felt the whiplash of the government’s shifting policy toward immigrants ― all while serving and cleaning up after the very politicians who will determine her family’s future here.Her route to the Senate basement began in 2005. Her mother was living in Washington at the time, and she used the family savings to arrange to bring her to the U.S. Gomez Ramirez was just 14 and living alone in El Salvador, where there was a lack of jobs and a lot of violence. She crossed the U.S.-Mexico border and reunited with her mother and older sister in Washington.The details of her 25-day journey are still fresh in her mind 12 years later. Traveling through the Guatemalan countryside. The 24 hours she spent cramped in the luggage hold at the bottom of a moving bus. The nights sleeping on the cold ground in the desert, wrapped in a sweater an old woman gave her. The demands by “coyotes” that her family send more money. And, finally, her passage across the border and into Texas.Gomez Ramirez started working as soon as she arrived in Washington, first at a McDonald’s and then, after she quit high school to earn more money, at a food supplier making Indian food, where she logged 13-hour days. She worked as a restaurant server, a dishwasher and as the lone woman on a car wash crew, scrubbing and detailing cars eight hours a day in the hot sun. She always sent a portion of every paycheck back to her grandmother in El Salvador.She went on to have three girls with her husband, Franklin, a fellow Salvadoran she met at church in the U.S. She never left Washington, not even when her father was murdered in El Salvador in 2009 or when her grandmother died in 2010, knowing that if she went to the funerals she might never return to the U.S. She worked to improve her English and re-enrolled in school. She studied while riding the Metro to and from the car wash. She attained her GED.In 2012, Obama announced the DACA program. Under the rules, undocumented immigrants who came to the country as minors could apply for deferred action from deportation and, if approved, get a work permit. Some 750,000 Dreamers ― named for the Dream Act, a failed bill that would have created a permanent program through Congress ― have received permission to stay in the U.S. through DACA.Gomez Ramirez was afraid to apply at first: “I didn’t know if they would grant it or deport me. The last word is theirs.” But with her family’s encouragement and the help of a legal aid group, she rounded up all the documentation showing how long she’d been in the U.S. and submitted it to the government. She kept calling U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to follow up, wondering why friends had been approved before her. She cried when she was finally granted DACA status roughly a year after she applied. Her aunt threw a party. The next day, she went out to look for a new job. “I wasn’t afraid,” she said. “I had the card.”She applied to work at the Senate office building, no longer worried about her immigration status, and took jobs working at the buffet and inside the coffeeshop. Her husband suffers from a kidney disease and is no longer able to work, so Gomez Ramirez has become the sole breadwinner for the family, stretching her salary to cover rent and groceries for a family of five.Last year, Gomez Ramirez showed how all workers can benefit when undocumented people are allowed to come out of the shadows. She and other concessions workers in Congress learned that the federal contractor that employs them had misclassified them, which resulted in hourly pay below the legally required prevailing wage. Dozens of low-wage workers were being shorted, right under the noses of members of Congress. With the help of a union-backed labor group called Good Jobs Nation, they took their case to the Labor Department and won backpay. Gomez Ramirez’s DACA status made her less fearful to speak up about pay and working conditions. She recently spoke at a rally outside the Capitol, calling for higher wages for federal contract workers. Because of the campaign she joined, she said she now earns $1.80 more per hour than she did before, and many other workers have received raises, too. But her newfound confidence buckled on Nov. 8. She and Franklin stayed up all night as the ballots were counted, and she wept once the election was called for Trump. The Republican candidate had called DACA “unconstitutional” and vowed to end it. Obama started the program with an executive action; Trump could just as easily unwind it, which would allow Gomez Ramirez’s work permit to expire. It isn’t at all clear what the new administration will ultimately do. Trump says he wants to focus on deporting people with criminal records rather than those who are working hard and supporting families. He also said he wants to handle DACA recipients with “heart,” calling the program a “very, very difficult subject for me.” He has continued the DACA program so far, despite calls from hard-liners to end it. While Trump has expressed compassion for Dreamers, the administration has continued its tough talk on immigrants who came here illegally, and it has promised to give immigration agents new leeway to do as they want. Sessions himself has given Dreamers reason to feel uneasy. “DACA enrollees are not being targeted ... [But] everybody in the country illegally is subject to being deported,” Sessions said last month on Fox News. “So people come here and they stay here a few years, and somehow they think that they’re not subject to being deported. Well, they are.” Even though Gomez Ramirez got a two-year renewal of her DACA status last year, Trump’s rise to power has changed the way she goes about her day. Last summer her family made the 14-hour drive to Orlando, Florida, to fulfill a promise to take their daughters to Disney World. Now, given the immigration climate, they would no longer risk such a long drive through unknown areas. “I don’t really go out a lot now,” she said. “I try to just come to work, do my thing and stay at home. I’m afraid again.”She feels no more secure for her husband. He has what’s known as temporary protected status from deportation, or TPS. The program allows immigrants to stay in the U.S. because of violence or disaster in their home countries. El Salvador was initially designated TPS because of earthquakes in 2001. The program exists at the discretion of the Department of Homeland Security, and if the Trump administration doesn’t renew it in early 2018, Franklin and 200,000 other Salvadorans could lose their protected status. On top of the immigration worries, he needs a kidney transplant. His family is trying to raise money for the operation.His health costs make Gomez Ramirez’s paycheck all the more important. She tries to keep her mind focused on her work rather than on the policies senators are drafting upstairs. She was reminded of this the day Sessions passed through her lane. As she told one of her colleagues afterward, they weren’t there to think about the lawmakers who come down the line or where they stand on immigration. They were there to serve them.“That is all that we do: We work,” Gomez Ramirez said. “We don’t come here to do anything else.” "

Dr. Travis Bradberry shares the unique habits that set them apart from the rest.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/590a24911700003800dd65a7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Influential people have a profound impact on everyone they encounter. Yet, they achieve this only because they exert so much influence inside, on themselves.We see only their outside.We see them innovate, speak their mind, and propel themselves forward toward bigger and better things.And, yet, we’re missing the best part.The confidence and wherewithal that make their influence possible are earned. It’s a labor of love that influential people pursue behind the scenes, every single day.And while what people are influenced by changes with the season, the unique habits of influential people remain constant. Their focused pursuit of excellence is driven by eight habits that you can emulate and absorb until your influence expands:1. They think for themselvesInfluential people aren’t buffeted by the latest trend or by public opinion. They form their opinions carefully, based on the facts. They’re more than willing to change their mind when the facts support it, but they aren’t influenced by what other people think, only by what they know.2. They are graciously disruptiveInfluential people are never satisfied with the status quo. They’re the ones who constantly ask, “What if?” and “Why not?” They’re not afraid to challenge conventional wisdom, and they don’t disrupt things for the sake of being disruptive; they do it to make things better.3. They inspire conversationWhen influential people speak, conversations spread like ripples in a pond. And those ripples are multidirectional; influencers inspire everyone around them to explore new ideas and think differently about their work.4. They leverage their networksInfluential people know how to make lasting connections. Not only do they know a lot of people, they get to know their connections’ connections. More importantly, they add value to everyone in their network. They share advice and know how, and they make connections between people who should get to know each other.5. They welcome disagreementInfluential people do not react emotionally and defensively to dissenting opinions—they welcome them. They’re humble enough to know that they don’t know everything and that someone else might see something they missed. And if that person is right, they embrace the idea wholeheartedly because they care more about the end result than being right.6. They are proactiveInfluential people don’t wait for things like new ideas and new technologies to find them; they seek those things out. These early adopters always want to anticipate what’s next. They’re influential because they see what’s coming, and they see what’s coming because they intentionally look for it. Then they spread the word.7. They respond rather than reactIf someone criticizes an influential person for making a mistake, or if someone else makes a critical mistake, influential people don’t react immediately and emotionally. They wait. They think. And then they deliver an appropriate response. Influential people know how important relationships are, and they won’t let an emotional overreaction harm theirs. They also know that emotions are contagious, and overreacting has a negative influence on everyone around them.8. They believeInfluential people always expect the best. They believe in their own power to achieve their dreams, and they believe others share that same power. They believe that nothing is out of reach, and that belief inspires those around them to stretch for their own goals. They firmly believe that one person can change the world.Bringing It All TogetherTo increase your influence, you need to freely share your skills and insights, and you must be passionate in your pursuit of a greater future.Please share your thoughts in the comments section, as I learn just as much from you as you do from me.Want to learn more from me?

Ahmed Etwiy, 26, and Mustafa Kassem, 52, both from New York, have each been detained for nearly four years without receiving prison sentences.In early April, President Donald Trump personally spoke with Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi about the case of imprisoned American aid worker Aya Hijazi, 30, who had been jailed for almost three years. An Egyptian court acquitted her weeks later, closing a case widely seen as an unsubstantiated witch hunt devised to boost Sissi’s image as a tough ruler independent of Washington.A U.S. military plane flew Hijazi home, and the Trump administration soon released photos of her in the Oval Office with the president and White House aides Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. Later that day, Trump boasted about the accomplishment via Twitter, in the form of a bizarre, self-congratulatory video set to the song “Proud To Be An American.”The three other detainees and their families grew hopeful, Hassan’s pro bono lawyer and relatives of Etwiy and Kassem told HuffPost this week. But they have since been disappointed. There’s no sign that the Trump administration is treating the remaining cases as priorities, they said. And a previously unreported May 2 State Department letter to Congress about Hassan’s case avoided answering the question of whether Trump mentioned him or the other detainees when he met with Sissi.“My expectations changed greatly,” Dr. Nagwa El Kordy, Etwiy’s mother, told HuffPost in an email. “Seeing Aya released after all this time gave me hope that the same can happen for my son. So far nobody from the Trump administration has contacted me. And the [American] embassy in Cairo hasn’t visited him for almost 3 months.”Praveen Madhiraju, an attorney for Hassan and the executive director of the nonprofit Pretrial Rights International, said the White House has not responded to multiple entreaties from Hassan’s family and lawyers ― including a letter the American teenager personally addressed to Trump.And Mustafa Hussain Ahmed, Kassem’s brother-in-law, said he had no idea how to even contact Trump’s team. He asked if HuffPost could connect him.The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Will Cocks, a spokesman for the State Department’s consular affairs bureau, said he could not comment on the three Americans’ cases because of “privacy considerations.” “We’re aware of media reports of U.S. citizens detained in Egypt,” Cocks wrote in a Friday email. “One of the most important tasks of the Department of State and U.S. embassies and consulates abroad is to provide assistance to U.S. citizens who are detained abroad.”“When a U.S. citizen is detained overseas, the Department works to provide all appropriate consular assistance... [which] may include attempting to ensure that the detained/arrested U.S. citizens receive a fair and speedy trial with the benefit of legal counsel; visiting detained/arrested U.S. nationals in prison to ensure that they are receiving humane treatment, including medical treatment if needed; facilitating communications with their families or others as they wish; and assisting with the transfer of funds from family and friends in the United States to pay for attorneys’ fees, food, and medicine while incarcerated,” Cocks went on.Representatives for the three jailed Americans say they are dealing with the challenges Cocks describes with only minimal U.S. government support. Hassan’s last appeals hearing, an opportunity for him to gain an early reprieve on his one-year sentence for challenging police officers who wanted to arrest his uncle, was meant to be on April 19. But authorities pushed it to July because, they claimed, not enough police officers were available to escort the 17-year-old to the courthouse. Etwiy and Kassem have been charged but not sentenced. Both have been in prison for nearly four years since being swept up in mass arrests during 2013 political protests. Etwiy has experienced depression and severe food poisoning, according to his mother; Kassem has had to wait up to two weeks for deliveries of the blood sugar control drug, NovoLog, that he uses to manage his diabetes, according to Ahmed, his brother-in law. Ahmed said the American consular visits were “useless” because officials told Kassem they could not be helpful beyond ensuring he does not die.The U.S. has maintained a close relationship with Egypt despite growing human rights concerns. At least 30,000 people have been arrested since the military took control in a Sissi-directed 2013 coup. Mass trials, beatings and solitary confinement have become common, and hundreds of prisoners remain behind bars long beyond legal limits on pre-trial detention. Human rights advocates say Egypt is experiencing the worst government repression in its contemporary history. Cairo claims the actions are necessary to combat terror, while outside analysts say Egypt is actually allowing the militant group known as the Islamic State to thrive.Estimates vary on how many Americans have been affected by the surge in state-sponsored violence. NPR reported a figure of 20 in April, but the Egyptian-American activist Mohamed Soltan, himself a former prisoner, told HuffPost this week that he thinks the number is now nine. The State Department refused to provide details. Egypt’s embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment.It’s unclear what Trump and his team are willing to do for these Americans. Soltan believes Egypt’s regime is more likely to respond to requests from Trump because of the personal praise he has showered on Sissi, one of the many authoritarian leaders Trump frequently mentions as favorite peers. The two presidents may see each other later this month when Trump meets with a group of Muslim leaders from around the world in Saudi Arabia.But the White House’s approach thus far does not suggest such personal requests are forthcoming. Hassan’s congressional representatives, Sens. Cory Booker (D) and Bob Menendez (D) and Rep. Frank LoBiondo (R) of New Jersey, sent Secretary of State Rex Tillerson a letter on April 25 inquiring about whether Trump or Tillerson had raised the young American’s case during meetings with Sissi earlier that month.On May 2, State Department official Joseph McManus responded to LoBiondo in a message the congressman’s office shared with those of the two senators. (No similar response was sent to Booker; Menendez’s office did not respond to a request for comment. Madhiraju, Hassan’s lawyer, said he was not aware of the contents of the message.)“We have been closely monitoring Ahmed’s case, including ensuring fair trial guarantees are respected,” McManus wrote in his letter to LoBiondo.McManus acknowledged that Egyptian authorities had delayed Hassan’s appeals hearing. “We have contacted Egyptian authorities to request an earlier hearing,” he wrote. He also said consular officials had visited the young American twice and requested a third visit. Hassan had not been moved to a juvenile facility because his family wanted him to stay at the police station where he was originally detained, McManus said.“We are in frequent contact with Ahmed’s family here and in Egypt,” he wrote. “During the consular visits mentioned above, Ahmed has not made any allegations of mistreatment during his incarceration... The family has told us they have regular access to him and that he has been treated fairly well. Ahmed’s father recently expressed concern to a consular officer about crowded and uncomfortable conditions at the police station, but told the officer he would confirm with Ahmed before for assistance to have him moved. If Ahmed requests a move during his next consular visit or through his father, we will contact the appropriate Egyptian authorities to facilitate that request.”The letter did not respond to the third question in the lawmakers’ original letter to Tillerson: “Did you or President Trump raise Ahmed’s case and those of other American citizens when President Sissi visited Washington in early April?”After being informed of the letter’s contents, Hassan’s attorney told HuffPost the State Department accurately described its efforts so far but that they were insufficient. “State’s first responsibility is to make sure one of ours has a fair trial and is treated humanely. If they are imprisoned unjustly, it’s then the President’s duty - both legal and moral - to demand their release,” Madhiraju wrote in a Saturday night email. Hassan “wasn’t able to speak with his attorney before trial. Etwiy and Kassem have been in jail for more than three years without trial. Monitoring their conditions is not enough.”Despite Trump’s talk of always putting America and Americans first, advocates believe more high-profile attention is necessary to really prompt a U.S. government push.“It’s important to note how crucial public opinion is in creating pressure on the administration to act more intentionally on behalf of these citizens,” Soltan and his sister, Middle East strategy consultant Hanaa Soltan, wrote to HuffPost. “Mohamed’s and Aya’s case both garnered quite a bit of attention before the administrations were moved to act on them as they did.” (The Obama administration lobbied for Mohamed Soltan’s release in 2015.)“Every case is a combination of factors, of sustained public and private engagement with the Egyptians at multiple levels from multiple actors. The strategy also depends upon what stage the case has reached in Egypt,” said Wade McMullen, an attorney for Hijazi, the freed aid worker, at the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights nonprofit. “President Trump and his administration deserve credit for personally engaging on Aya and [her husband] Mohamed’s case with President Sisi and other Egyptian officials. But a lot of people deserve credit for Aya’s and Mohamed’s freedom.” In a Wednesday email, McMullen cited the Egyptian legal team, Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) and advocacy organizations and U.S. officials.For now, the other Americans remain behind bars.“Trump is spending his weekends golfing in Bedminster, N.J., while Ahmed will spend his 18th birthday in jail,” Madhiraju said, noting that Hassan’s birthday is on May 25 and that the president is legally required to make inquiries to any foreign government that unjustly detains an American.  Hassan described the conditions in his March letter to Trump.“I’ve been in jail in Egypt since December 1, 2016, and am laughed at and mistreated by the police here because I am American. Please help me,” he wrote. “I am in a jail cell with more than 20 adults. It is scary to be here with these people and the police... I am proud to be an American. I beg you to defend my right to be free.”CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misidentified Hanaa Soltan as a lawyer. She is a consultant focused on Middle East affairs who works closely with lawyers and advocates on issues like helping Americans detained abroad; she is not an attorney."

This day can be a painful reminder to many women that they are not mothers yet. If you know someone who is trying to conceive, undergoing fertility treatments, or had a miscarriage, you may want to reach out to her this Mother’s Day but don’t know how. She is grieving a loss for something she does not have yet.Here are five ways to support her:1. Be understanding if she does not want to celebrate on Mother’s Day. Women who are not mothers yet may decline invitations for events on Mother’s Day and that’s ok. If you know why she is not celebrating and the rest of the family does not then be supportive of her choice with other people who do not know the whole story.2. Say something, because silence can be empty and lonely. So often we are silent when a loved one is grieving because we are afraid we’ll say the wrong thing. Showing someone you care is never the wrong thing. Try, “I’m thinking of you this Mother’s Day – I’m here if you want to talk or spend time together.”3. Do something to show you care. Offer to do an activity she loves on the same weekend – go hiking, go shopping, go to a movie. If you know she needs to get Mother’s Day cards or gifts for her family and that this may be painful for her, offer to do it for her. Send her flowers or a card letting her know that you care.4. Be supportive if she doesn’t want to accept your invitation to go out or talk during this time. It’s most important that she knows you care and if she needs her space, that’s ok.5. Play interference if she wants you to explain to friends or family why she is withdrawn and not participating in Mother’s Day events. She may appreciate an ally who can explain to others why she is not celebrating.Not being a mother yet on Mother’s Day can be isolating. Women can feel left out of the “Mother’s Day Club” and be reminded of how much they want their own family. The most important thing you can do for them is to show support, be present, and help them realize they are not alone.More helpful posts at lorashahine.com.
