0,POLITICS,The Trump-Induced Breakup Of The GOP Has Begun,Sam Stein and Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republican-party-breakup-trump_us_58025048e4b0162c043c558c,Trump is mad at elected officials. Donors are mad at the RNC. And everyone anticipates a bloodbath on Election Day.,2016-10-15,RNC Chair Reince Priebus has stuck with Trump under immense pressure to abandon the nominee. That loyalty could cost him his job.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After a week of repeated allegations that Donald Trump sexually assaulted women at various stages of his life, top Republican donors and even some rank-and-file lawmakers are urging the party to fully cordon itself off from its presidential nominee.Trump did himself no favors with this crowd this week: disparaging his accusers’ physical appearance, launching tirades against the press corps, and giving a more full throated endorsement of the notion that the election was rigged against him.Watching from afar, a number of top Republican donors were aghast. One very high ranking Wall Street donor said that pressure on the RNC to cut ties with Trump “is intense.” As for the RNC’s chairman, Reince Priebus, the donor warned that “his re-elect [as chair] was on the line by holding firm” to Trump.Trump has put top Republicans in a bind, forced to choose between alienating the vast number of voters devoted to the real estate mogul and the elite wing of the party that finds him repulsive. So far, they have largely sought a middle ground, denouncing the candidate at times while never fully severing their ties. But as the election nears and the limit of Trump’s political abilities and appeal become clearer, walking that line has grown much harder. One Republican National Committee member told The Huffington Post that he advised congressional candidates to avoid an event featuring Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, out of fear that they’d be hounded by the press over the nominee’s sexual assault allegations. Other party officials have told HuffPost that fundraising for down-ballot races has been hit hard by antipathy to Trump’s presence on the ticket.Mark DeMoss, a fundraiser for Mitt Romney in 2012, is one of the donors sitting out this cycle. He acknowledged that it was “perhaps” unfair to congressional candidates embroiled in their own specific elections. But his distaste for the top of the ticket determined everything else. “I’m very distraught about it,” he said. “I just think it’s the most shallow, petty, immature presidential race of my lifetime. I’m 54… I’m not sure how we got here and I’m not sure where we go from here, either.”DeMoss, the head of a major Christian public relations firm, said he would be more inclined to give to the RNC if it formally broke with Trump. “But I wouldn’t give a dollar to the RNC if it was a joint funding project with the Trump campaign,” he said.The RNC, for its part, has already begun diverting resources to down-ballot races. This week, they transferred $4.5 million to the National Republican Senatorial Committee and $1.85 million to the National Republican Congressional Committee. But officials say they did so with the acquiescence of the Trump campaign and they continue to argue that there is no strategic rationale for abandoning the party’s nominee. “It is job of the party to do everything it can to keep Democrats from winning office, number one. Number two is to fulfill the will of the people who determine our nominees,” said Sean Spicer, a top official at the RNC who works closely with Trump headquarters. “What do they want us to do? Tell me what it is that they want. What is that alternative they are asking for? “It doesn’t make sense,” Spicer added. “If you are turning out a voter to vote in Ohio and Pennsylvania you don’t turn him out just to do certain things. And frankly if you talk to [Sens. Pat] Toomey or [Kelly] Ayotte, they won’t win unless they get the Trump supporters. It is a non-logical argument.”But at least one GOP official involved in Senate campaigns says the party screwed up by sticking with Trump. “We should have dumped him,” said this official, who requested anonymity in order to speak freely. “It’s too late now.”The official described Senate candidates as being left in the lurch as the RNC focused on Trump triage. The never-ending stream of damaging Trump stories had forced them to keep contact with those vulnerable Senate candidates literally every hour, every day, on how to best navigate their races. And without sufficient funding help, they’ve been overwhelmed on the airwaves. In North Carolina, for example, Trump has spent roughly $3 million on TV ads compared to Clinton’s $20 million, said this official. This week, Clinton’s super PAC, Priorities USA, announced it may start spending specifically on Senate races, too.“We are getting freaking slaughtered in TV spending,” said the official. “It’s not like he’s got some sort of awesome ground game going on, either. He’s not doing any data analysis.”The RNC, the official added, wasn’t returning phone calls at this point. “They’re fucking useless,” the official said. Senate republicans, the official added, were “the only thing that’s going well at this point.”Even House Republicans, whose majority once seemed secure, have begun fretting over the ripple effects of a Trump implosion. Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) said this week that he would place all his attention solely on congressional races. It was a nifty bit of misdirection, allowing Ryan to claim distance from Trump without actually reneging his endorsement. But it was symbolically important.“I wouldn’t be surprised that there are candidates out there looking at polling numbers and coming to the conclusion that one of the better arguments they can make is they need to be a check and balance on Hillary Clinton if she is elected,” said Sam Geduldig, a GOP lobbyist who served as political director to the Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio). “It’s a good argument. It would resonate given Clinton’s poor polling numbers.”The million dollar question confronting the Republican Party is whether such a shift will work. Even the mere appearance of abandoning Trump, after all, carries the risk of angering his base ― a problem that Trump defectors like Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) are now confronting. But this is what the nominee has wrought: a party split between those who adore him, those who hate him and those who must try and hold their nose around him. It’s a dynamic perfectly personified by one top Republican fundraiser who is backing the nominee. Watching an interview Trump gave with Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly this past week, this fundraiser said he was practically dumbfounded. “O’Reilly interviewed him and threw him 15 softballs that he should have hit out of the park and what does he do? He sits there and stares and denounces [Paul] Ryan and McCain. I was watching with interest and my wife turned to me and said: ‘I don’t know if I could vote for him.’ I said, ‘You’re voting for him!’ But it went through my mind: What if Putin insults him? Does he drop a bomb on Moscow or something? I’m not sure he is stable.”“I’m voting against her because I can’t stand the woman,” he explained, when asked how he could possibly vote for someone he thought might not be stable. “But I think he is a jackass and I don’t think he’s mentally balanced.”HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

1,WEIRD NEWS,It's Time For Real Clowns To Do This,"Tanya Solomon, ContributorMagician and variety producer.

Just let it go. It's the worst year ever to be called a ""clown",2016-10-15,<p>Real clowns (like the late Oleg Popov) wear makeup to exaggerate their foolishness from a distance - not to terrify you.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/581b60d71500001500531826.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It's time for professional clowns to abandon the word ""clown"". Just let it go.It's the worst year ever to be called a ""clown"". For months, the name has been a synonym for Donald Trump. And now there are widespread reports of red-nosed maniacs lurking in the woods.Real clowns - performing clowns - have been valiantly defending themselves online in recent days, trying to salvage their profession's good name. But it's a losing battle.As a comic performer (formerly a stage clown, now a comedy magician), I think about this a lot, and I have a suggestion.There is only one connection between scary clowns, Trump, and real clowns: breaking society's rules, and the wild unpredictability that comes with that. Performing clowns, from Mr. Bean to a hospital clown playing a foolish doctor to cheer up a sick kid, get the audience to laugh with them at society's restrictions. Everybody secretly knows that society is a lie humans tell themselves. The clown acts out our wishes to follow our individual desires with reckless, joyous stupidity. They play the fool, the idiot, the innocent. Sometimes they wear makeup to look more cartoonish. But makeup never makes anyone a clown. And the performers know that in their offstage lives, they have to abide by many of society's rules to avoid harming others - a message that Trump and other sociopaths never got.Clowns are not heartwarming creatures. They're not sad figurines in your grandma's china cabinet. They are jerks - jerks who bring the audience delight by acting in a way we all wish we could. But in contrast to real sociopaths, the actor playing the clown does it for other people. They act out their selfish desires with the unselfish goal of giving the audience a gift of laughter.Sadly, the word ""clown"" no longer refers to this great and ancient profession. To most people, it means someone with nothing to offer others but horror and disgust: an axe murderer with a frozen smile, or an idiot politician.Here's my proposal to real clowns: Let it go. The word is finished; let pop culture and the media have their way with it. It's much simpler to just call ourselves something else. Let's skip the multisyllabic yawns like ""physical comedian"". Old-fashioned words like ""buffoon"" are OK, but I think we could do better. I propose ""buster"". It suggests busting social pretension, busting your ass when you fall down, and pays tribute to a great clown without makeup, Buster Keaton.Or maybe we should just go with this suggestion from a 9-year-old clowning student of mine. When asked what we should be called instead of ""clowns"", she thought for three seconds before responding, ""dumb crying people that hang on clotheslines from their underpants on Wednesday at 7:01 pm"".She gets it."
2,BLACK VOICES,HBCUs Changed How I View Educational Success,"Eddie Francis, ContributorAward-Winning Media Veteran, Talent Acquisition Professional, ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hbcus-changed-how-i-view-educational-success_us_5802b51ee4b0f42ad3d26298,"Recently, my 12-year-old son told me that he wants to be a naval architect so we started researching colleges and universities",2016-10-15,<p><em>Leading a press conference as Southern University at New Orleans’ PR director in 2011</em></p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d661201400002600071811.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Recently, my 12-year-old son told me that he wants to be a naval architect so we started researching colleges and universities. One university we looked at is Hampton, a historically black university in Virginia. I was inspired to do so by my wife who is an alumna. Ever grateful to her “home by the sea,” she often talks about how her undergraduate experience enhanced her sense of self-worth. I have found a similar spirit among other Hampton alumni and I would love for my son to have that kind of higher education experience. While it makes perfect sense for me to introduce an HBCU to the college search conversation, I may have not made such a suggestion once upon a time. Years ago, I put all of my eggs into the reputation, rankings and statistics basket when considering the value of colleges and universities.I wasn’t alone. Common views of educational success rely on images of chin-up, power suit, upper crust alumni but an October 2015 Gallup study showed how HBCUs add another dimension to the conversation. As part of a larger effort focused on the relationship between graduates’ college and life experiences, this study shows how HBCU alumni have an advantage in five areas of well-being: purpose, social, financial, community, physical, and thriving. According to the study, a majority of black HBCU graduates “have strong social relationships and they like what they do each day and are motivated to achieve goals.” Moreover, the study found that 35 percent of the black HBCU graduates surveyed strongly agreed that they had a professor “who cared about them as a person, a professor who made them excited about learning and a mentor who encouraged them to pursue their goals and dreams” versus 12 percent of black graduates from other types of colleges and universities. Although the study focuses on black graduates, it is clear that HBCUs have a tendency to deliver something that goes deeper than popular success eye candy. To paraphrase Brandon Busteed, Gallup’s executive director of Education and Workforce Development, the findings from the HBCU study expand the conversation about what educational success looks like. As a recruiter, I can tell you that a high GPA and from a well-known college or university looks great on paper but a confident, determined candidate makes you want to know more about their alma mater. Having worked at two HBCUs, I have learned that providing a student with a sense of fulfillment adds a tremendous amount of value to the academic experience. This is far from a “black thing.” This is a global conversation. Macroeconomics scholar Fabio Aricò, a senior lecturer at the University of East Anglia in the U.K., argued that “more effort should be invested in turning students into confident individuals” as a way of helping them achieve greater self-reliance to face professional challenges. The key to success, therefore, is to provide the student with a fulfilling experience instead of relying on the reputation of the school for a successful outcome.So, let’s think big. Let’s pause these unproductive discussions about the relevance of HBCUs and this fruitless #HBCUvsPWI social media debate. Instead, let’s discuss how HBCUs’ presence enriches American higher education. After all, we have great examples of HBCU alumni like: Dr. Ruth Simmons (Dillard), the daughter of sharecroppers who became the first African American president of an Ivy League institution; Dr. Rod Paige (Jackson State), the first African American U.S. secretary of education; and the very charming Michael Strahan (Texas Southern). Despite well-documented challenges, HBCUs continue to produce alumni who reflect the grit and resilience of their alma maters—two attributes that often supersede institutional reputation.William Butler Yeats (allegedly) said, “Education is not the filling of a pail but the lighting of a fire.” HBCUs provide an environment where students can receive a spark from culturally competent pedagogy and social environments that cultivate self-worth and foster a sense of well-being. Thanks to my up-close-and-personal experience with HBCUs, I can show my son a fuller picture of how to use higher education for his intellectual and career development."
3,POLITICS,Man Who Held 'Better To Grab A P***y Than To Be One' Sign At Pro-Trump Rally Has Ties To White Nationalists,Dana Liebelson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-white-nationalists_us_580129dde4b06e047594bc5f,Who would have guessed?,2016-10-15,Devin Saucier holds his sign at a recent event in support of Donald Trump.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58012afa170000bc16acc0df.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― When Donald Trump supporters protested outside the headquarters of the Republican National Committee earlier this week in Washington, D.C.,  one sign made headlines for its vulgarity: “Better to Grab a P***y Than To Be One.” The man holding the sign, which makes light of Trump’s boast that he can grope women with impunity, has ties to white nationalist groups.Devin Saucier has attended events with prominent “suit-and-tie” white nationalists; is associated with a Virginia-based group that the Daily Beast described as “white-power wolf cult”; and co-founded a controversial student group at Vanderbilt University that fought against diversity.In a YouTube video posted on Oct. 10 from a pro-Trump rally, the man holding the sign says he’s from Fairfax, Virginia, and identifies himself as Devin Saucier, spelling his first and last names. His appearance in the footage resembles photographs and video of the same Devin Saucier who co-founded the Vanderbilt student group and has been linked to white nationalists.Saucier did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has painted many Trump supporters as “racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic — you name it.” Although many conservatives took issue with her description of Trump supporters as a “basket of deplorables,” members of the so-called alt-Right, a group that seeks to distinguish itself from mainstream conservatism by openly supporting racist and anti-Semitic policies, have openly embraced the label. And Saucier’s ties to people involved with the movement go way back.As a student at Vanderbilt, Saucier helped found a chapter of the national organization The Youth for Western Civilization. Carol Swain, a conservative law professor at Vanderbilt who is black, recalls that the group “didn’t do anything controversial, other than, you know, push for traditional values.” Swain, who is against the Black Lives Matter movement, has written about the danger of a new white nationalism.But at the time, The Youth for Western Civilization “really was a racist group,” said Mark Potok, a senior fellow at the Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit that tracks hate groups. Jesse Jones, a student at the time who wrote libertarian-leaning op-eds for the main campus newspaper, said Saucier’s views “did freak me out.” He recalled that it was a “blood and soil”-type nationalist movement. In emails he exchanged with Saucier in 2009, Saucier — using the same overtly academic language that has become a hallmark of the alt-right — argued that “multiculturalism is the fundamental belief that all cultures are equal, an idea which we oppose.” In the lengthy exchange, he denied that his organization was fascist, and separately argued against immigration. (”Mexico deals w/ unemployment by telling their unemployed to migrate north,” he wrote.) In another response, he said he would like to see a curriculum where “we don’t just learn that George Washington was a slave owner, but that he had some fine characteristics as well.” In 2010, Saucier’s group invited Richard Spencer, a white nationalist who has since become a prominent member of the pro-Trump “alt-Right,” to speak. In his speech, Spencer made the argument that the word diversity should be substituted with “anti-white discrimination.” Spencer did not respond to a request for comment.Jones said that at the time, he worried about what Saucier’s small intellectual movement represented and how it might gain a less-educated following down the road — a prediction that appears to have been prescient. Jones was dismayed to learn that it was his former classmate holding the pro-Trump “p***y” sign. Saucier has appeared in photos of gatherings from the Wolves of Vinland, “a neo-pagan group that celebrates a guy [Maurice “Hjalti” Michaely] who tried to burn down a black church,” according to the Daily Beast. A Facebook screenshot on a website that follows the group shows a user named Devin Saucier “liking” a post that shows Michaely in prison and says, “free Hjalti you fucking pricks.” Saucier has also recently appeared at events with Jared Taylor, editor of the pseudo-academic journal American Renaissance, which promotes “a variety of white racial positions,” according to the website’s tagline. At an event at the National Press Club in May 2015, “Prospects for Black America,” Taylor asked if the panel would consider whether the answer to the question of “what’s up with black people” was “partially, at least, heritable genetic traits.” Taylor did not respond to a request for comment.Potok, from the Southern Poverty Law Center, said he is not surprised “in the least” that people with Saucier’s views are still showing up to support Trump. The Republican nominee has given the white nationalist movement an unprecedented platform — “I will be profoundly grateful to Donald Trump for the rest of my life,” Spencer tweeted on Friday. The numerous sexual misconduct allegations lodged against Trump recently don’t seem to be changing that support. (Trump denies the allegations.)“I don’t think anyone is surprised that Trump may talk like that behind closed doors,” Saucier told a newscaster on Monday. “No one thinks he’s the most morally upstanding guy, but he’s our guy.” Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
4,POLITICS,An Open Letter To The 'New York Times' Who Told Brown Asians They Don't Matter,"E. J. R. David, Ph.D., ContributorAssociate Professor of Psychology; Author of ""Brown Skin, Whit...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/an-open-letter-to-the-new-york-times-who-told-brown_us_5801ac3fe4b0985f6d1570f1,The continued failure to include us whenever you talk about Asian Americans is extremely insulting.,2016-10-15,Filipinos and Asian Indians are disproportionately underrepresented in New York Times articles.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5801bbdf1a000024055b9a21.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Dear New York Times:Maybe we should have let it go, like we’ve done many times before ― turned our other brown cheek. E.J. just woke up in Seattle; the rest of us were beginning our work days on the East Coast. All of us were expecting to go through a normal Friday. Then we saw that you just posted a video to accompany Michael Luo’s powerful letter about a racist encounter he had and the very much-needed #thisis2016 hashtag it inspired. We got excited! We watched the same video showing a gaggle of people talk about the “Asian American” experience.And we were, honestly, stunned. Your video told us, “You’re still invisible!”You did this during Filipino American History Month ― the month when we are supposed to be most proud of our brown presence in the U.S.And you did this during election season ― when xenophobia against South Asians is on the rise and Islamophobia is so overt that Muslim Americans (and South Asian Americans who are presumed to be Muslim) expect to be discriminated in their everyday lives.We hesitated for a second and then hustled to confront you. We pulled out our smartphones and started commenting on your social media posts, questioning why seemingly 96% of the stories shared were East Asian or non-Brown Asian stories. It was comical, in retrospect, because you probably don’t even read comments on social media. But the pain you inflicted on us with your continued disregard is real. It clearly tells us, once again, that we are unseen, unheard, and unappreciated in this country.“We are a part of this country!” We yelled back.It felt silly. But how else to prove we belonged?This was not our first encounter, of course, with marginalization – even among Asian Americans. Ask any Filipino American or South Asian – or anyone who is not Chinese, Korean or Japanese – and they’ll readily summon memories of repeated attempts to explain why we are not “yellow,” or disturbing encounters on the street, grocery store, airport, and anywhere really, because our brown skin activates different kinds of stereotypes in this country.This was not even our first encounter with you, as over the past six months you have released two videos about the “Asian American” experience. Combined, both videos showed the stories of 37 Asian Americans, but only one (3%) was a Filipino story, at a time when Filipinos compose 20% of the Asian American population. And only five out of the 37 (13.5%) seemed to be South Asian stories with the most recent video not having any South Asian at all, at a time when South Asians also compose 20% of the Asian American population. In fact, we’re so tired of being forgotten that there has been a few times when we took it upon ourselves to have our stories be heard.Sure, there are some efforts to better address this great diversity within the large Asian Pacific Islander umbrella, like the progress toward disaggregating data so that we can better understand the issues facing our communities.But for some reason — and, yes, it probably has to do with the political climate right now that makes brown-skinned people, especially “foreign-looking” ones with “weird names” and who are not Christians, very vulnerable — this time felt different.A few hours later, after thinking about it some more, a pang of sadness welled up inside us.You are in New York City where there’s no shortage of Brown Asians. You have enough resources to make it happen. You have highly-educated staff. You seemed, well, informed. But yet you still don’t see us, and, the reality is, neither do many in this country right now.Maybe you don’t know this, but the continued failure to include us whenever you talk about “Asian Americans” is extremely insulting, degrading, and oppressive. It gets to the heart of the invisibility that Brown Asians experience. As Michael Luo stated, “It’s this persistent sense of otherness that a lot of us struggle with every day,” but we also feel this marginalization within the Asian American community! That even though we compose more than half of the Asian Pacific Islander population, even though we have been in these lands now called the United States since 1587, and even though many of us trace our roots back to lands that are affected by U.S. colonialism and imperialism, we still don’t belong. We’re still forgotten. We’re still not Asian American, let alone American. It’s one of the reasons many Brown Asians do not identify as Asian Americans. Perhaps we just don’t feel connected to East Asian people, cultures, and lived realities. Perhaps we also don’t feel welcomed and included.Once again, we feel like outsiders – even within the Asian American community.And we wonder if that feeling will ever go away. Perhaps, more important, we wonder whether future generations of Brown Asians will always feel that way too.E.J.’s 7-year-old son, who also watched the video, observed, “Those people don’t look like you, Dad. They don’t look like us.”No, they don’t, and although there are similarities – our experiences are very different. E.J. tried to explain why you might have forgotten to include Brown Asians and why we matter. Dr. Karthick Ramakrishnan tried to explain this too.We’re Asian Americans, E.J. said, at least that’s what society tells us. But, even though this is 2016, people still don’t understand that #BrownAsiansExist.I hope you do now.Sincerely,E.J.R.

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb83057220000ba01dd4528.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This past week, I traveled to Dearborn, Michigan where I addressed a Hillary for America campaign event. Held at the Arab American National Museum, the gathering provided me with the opportunity to explain why I was endorsing Hillary Clinton for President. I offered four key reasons.   In the first instance, my endorsement was about her. She is, without a doubt, one of the smartest, toughest, and most experienced candidates to ever run for president. As important as these qualities are, I am also in awe of her self-control.   As I watched the last Presidential debate, I marveled at Hillary Clinton's ability to remain composed in the face of her opponent's hostility and vile provocation. Given what we know of Donald Trump's disgusting behavior and his demeaning attitude toward women, I would have found it difficult to even appear on stage with him. And yet she did so with great poise and dignity.   While these personal traits served her well in a debate settling--they are also essential for a president who will be tested by major challenges every minute of every day. When the 90 minute debate ended, I came away more convinced than ever that Hillary Clinton has, to borrow Richard Ben Cramer's phrase, the ""right stuff"" to lead our nation.  Another reason behind my wanting Hillary Clinton to win has to do with us--my community and our partners in the coalitions of concern with whom we work most closely. As some might know, I was deeply involved with the Bernie Sanders' campaign. I agreed with Bernie on most issues and as a Democratic Party super-delegate I voted for him at the convention. I also proudly served as one of his representatives to the party's platform drafting committee where we fought with the Clinton team to shape the party's political agenda.   I reject the notion that this election can be reduced to choosing 'the lesser of two evils.'  Bernie has correctly noted that the resultant document was the ""most progressive in the party's history"". We forged consensus on a range of issues like: abolishing the death penalty; raising the minimum wage; expanding Social Security; creating a public option health insurance; eliminating Super PACs; closing the loopholes in racial profiling and expanding the definition of ""racial"" to include religion and national origin; increasing support for Lebanon and Jordan; the need to work more closely with Arab allies; and increasing the number of refugees admitted to the US without discrimination based on religion or ethnicity.   We did not get the platform language we fought for on Israel-Palestine, but for the first time in history the party calls for providing ""Palestinians with independence, sovereignty, and dignity"" noting that they ""should be free to govern themselves in their own viable state in peace and dignity"". Having scars to show from three decades of party platform battles, I can testify that this was an important step forward.   We won these battles working with allies--liberals and progressives; African Americans Latinos, and Native Americans; labor and environmental activists. We supported them and they supported us. That is the essence of working in coalition. We cannot abandon our allies because we didn't get everything we wanted. If we hope we can count on them to be with us, then they need to know that they can count on us to remain with them.   When Hillary Clinton wins, we will all be better positioned to continue our combined effort to insist that the platform we endorsed becomes policy and to continue working together to press for even greater changes in policy.   Finally, my endorsement of Hillary Clinton is about him. I not only oppose Donald Trump, I find him to be the most frightening figure to emerge on the political scene in my lifetime. On October 14, 2016, the Washington Post summed up the case against Trump in one sentence describing him as ""bigoted, ignorant, deceitful, narcissistic, vengeful, petty, misogynistic, fiscally reckless, intellectually lazy, contemptuous of democracy, and enamored of America's enemies"". They concluded by noting that ""as president, he would pose a grave danger to the nation and the world"".   What Donald Trump has done in this campaign is prey off of the fear and anger of some Americans who feel adrift in today's changing economy. Instead of providing them with real solutions, he has given them enemies to blame--Mexicans, Muslims, Blacks, etc. He has made hate-speech acceptable and unleashed a torrent of anger that, I fear, will be difficult to rein in after this election is over. I, therefore, not only believe that it is imperative that he lose this election, he must lose by a margin so large that it serves as both as a repudiation of his hate and a mandate for Hillary Clinton to govern.   That said, I reject the notion that this election can be reduced to choosing ""the lesser of two evils"". It is, in fact, about supporting the best candidate--the one who, despite whatever differences one might have with some of her positions, has demonstrated that she is tough, smart, experienced, and relentless in fighting to make America better. That's why I am proud to endorse Hillary Clinton.   And, by the way, the fact that in electing Hillary we will have our first woman president is a matter of consequence. As a son, a brother, a husband, a father of three daughters, and a grandfather of five more, I will be so proud when Hillary takes the oath of office because at that moment they will know that there are no limits to which they can aspire.   These are the reasons I will be working to ensure a Hillary Clinton victory in November. Follow @jjz1600 for more. "

It's all a vast left-wing conspiracy.

Trump claimed journalists are actually lobbyists and the recent accusations against him were generated by the media. (Photo by Sara D.

It's all a vast left-wing conspiracy. No, really. Well, he didn't actually use that term, but he did indeed go full-on conspiracy theorist at a recent rally. He blamed the Obamas, the Clintons, the world banking cabal (no dog-whistles there, right?), corporations, and anyone else he could think of. In other words, we seriously doubt Donald Trump is going to give a polite and respectful concession speech on Election Night. This is Trump, unshackled (to use his own term). Trump unchained. Trump off the leash. And it ain't pretty.This entire election has already been a rollercoaster of historic proportions. Each and every time you think: ""Well, it certainly can't get much worse,"" it does. Over and over again. And (a frightening thought if ever there was one) we still have over three weeks to go.Last week was a textbook example of why political observers always say ""a week is an eternity in politics."" As was the week before it, come to think. And the week before that. Donald Trump simply crams so much bizarreness into such a short stretch of time, that it is now hard to remember a time before what is now being called ""pussygate"" had happened. Remember those quaint days of yore when the biggest news was Trump hadn't paid any federal income taxes for two decades? Seems like months ago, now. Remember when Trump was on the offensive against Bill Clinton's sexual past? That was only a week ago, when he tried to seat four Clinton accusers in his family box at the town hall debate.The most delicious irony of the past week came from Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway. Last week, she tweeted a link to a Hillary Clinton quote: ""Every survivor of sexual assault deserves to be heard, believed, and supported."" Conway even highlighted the word ""every"" in her own tweet, to drive the point home. This week, she's been fully occupied by explaining that every single one of the women who are now accusing Trump of sexual harassment, misconduct, and assault -- and this list is now growing by the day -- are all liars. ""Every"" last one of them. The phrase ""hoist on her own petard"" doesn't even begin to describe her flailings.The second-most delicious bit of tasty, tasty irony was seeing Gayle King on the CBS morning show, asking Conway about Melania Trump's fashion choice for the outfit she wore to the debate, which (you just can't make this stuff up, folks) is properly called a ""pussy-bow blouse."" Hoo boy.There's been so much Trump news this week that we're going to have to just run it down without a whole lot of commentary. The week started off last Friday (our weeks are measured Friday-to-Friday, of course) with the Washington Post bombshell release of the Billy Bush Access Hollywood tape. Next up was the second presidential debate, which most news commenters reported using either the word ""brutal"" or the phrase ""scorched Earth."" And we've still got one debate to go, next week.Then Paul Ryan told his House caucus that it was, essentially, every Republican for themselves. He was essentially conceding that Hillary Clinton will be our next president, and that all GOP House members should now concentrate on winning their own races rather than get dragged down by Trump. This came in the midst of an exodus of Republicans jumping off the Trump train, hoping that they'd made the leap before the train headed over the cliff. USA Today tallied this tsunami of ""dump Trump-ers"" and came up with a whopping one-in-four GOP governors and members of Congress who are refusing to support their own party's presidential nominee. This is unprecedented, folks.Stunningly, this was followed by a handful of Republicans flip-flopping back to supporting Trump, after hearing from their own pro-Trump constituents. When the history of this election is written, they will surely be grouped under the heading ""Profiles in Cowardice.""Team Trump tried to go on the offense again, but wound up being just downright offensive, with a new ad on Hillary Clinton's health that is so sleazy it makes you want to wash your eyeballs after viewing it. Yeah, that's the way to get women voters back!This was about the point when women started publicly accusing Trump of sexual misconduct, all of whom have stated that what drove them to go public was Trump's flat-out statement during the debate (when asked about the Billy Bush tape) that it was ""just words"" and he had never actually done anything like what he was caught bragging about. Trump has called them all liars, and is now actually making the argument that he would never have forced himself on any of these women because (are you sitting down?) they simply weren't hot enough to merit his attention. Headlines like ""Trump Isn't Just A Pig. He's A Predator"" began appearing to describe the ongoing meltdown. Time magazine updated their ""Trump meltdown"" cover, but The Economist probably had the best cover of the week, with a profile of Trump's face as the Republican elephant's ass.Maine Governor Paul LePage keeps trying to compete with Trump's craziness (since LePage prides himself on being the craziest Republican around, of course), and came up with the following gem:Sometimes, I wonder that our Constitution is not only broken, but we need a Donald Trump to show some authoritarian power in our country and bring back the rule of law because we've had eight years of a president, he's an autocrat, he just does it on his own, he ignores Congress and every single day, we're slipping into anarchy.Got that? Obama's an autocrat, and that's bad, so we've got to elect our kind of autocrat in order to make everything better. But LePage just doesn't raise the eyebrows all that much these days, since he's got Trump himself to compete with.Meanwhile, down at Jerry Falwell's Liberty University, the students are protesting -- in a school not generally known for student protest (to put it mildly). Who are they protesting? Their university's own president, Falwell's son. Here's what they had to say:Because our president has led the world to believe that Liberty University supports Donald Trump, we students must take it upon ourselves to make clear that Donald Trump is absolutely opposed to what we believe, and does not have our support. We are not proclaiming our opposition to Donald Trump out of bitterness, but out of a desire to regain the integrity of our school.Falwell Jr. shot back, completely incoherently:I am proud of these few students for speaking their minds but I'm afraid the statement is incoherent and false. I am not ""touring the country"" or associating Liberty University with any candidate. I am only fulfilling my obligation as a citizen to ""render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's"" by expressing my personal opinion about who I believe is best suited to lead our nation in a time of crisis. This student statement seems to ignore the teachings of Jesus not to judge others but they are young and still learning.Yeah, Jesus said not to judge lest ye be judged! So please don't interrupt me judging the heck out of Hillary Clinton -- because that is not ""judging,"" but rather ""expressing my personal opinion about who I believe is best suited to lead our nation in a time of crisis."" BIG difference... NOT. On top of that, he's completely misunderstanding the whole render-unto-Caesar thing, which was actually about paying taxes you didn't like.Nate Silver sent a shiver of excitement through Trump World this week, by pointing out that there is a stark gender divide in the election. Silver published two electoral maps, showing that if only women voted, Hillary Clinton would win with one of the biggest landslides in American history, capturing 458 Electoral College votes, to Trump's 80. But if only men's votes were counted, Trump would win 350 to Clinton's 188. This was cause for celebration for one of Trump's offspring, who tweeted the men-only map as if it were an actual reflection of current polls of all voters. Whoops! On Twitter, the hashtag #RepealThe19th appeared, because the obvious answer to Trump's problem with women voters is just to not let them vote (the 19th Amendment, passed almost a century ago, gave women the right to vote). Again: how's that outreach to women voters going, Republicans?By the end of the week, big Republican donors were rumored to be pressuring the Republican National Committee to just cut Trump loose for good, and spend all their money on salvaging what they could in the House and Senate. Former George W. Bush speechwriter (turned Republican pundit) Michael Gerson even rang the death knell of the Republican Party in an extraordinary article that concluded:This much is clear: Republican leaders offered no effective resistance to the ideological and political demolition of their party. Which may, in the worst case, give George W. Bush the distinction of being the final Republican president.In the state-by-state horserace, Trump's supposed ""path to victory"" has almost completely disappeared. Want to get under a Republican voter's skin? Just point out the following: ""Hey, remember back when Trump was saying he was going to win in places like New York, Connecticut, and Oregon? Those were the days... now he'll be lucky if he even wins Georgia, Texas, or Utah!"" That's right -- a poll from Utah just showed Trump and Clinton tied. A poll from Texas showed Clinton within striking distance of Trump. Among all this cheery news, Team Trump has decided to concede Virginia, and pulled staff and money out of the state. If Hillary Clinton wins Texas, she's almost certain to beat Barack Obama's 2008 landslide numbers, since Texas has the second-largest total in the Electoral College (38 votes, second only to California's 55).Let's see, what else? A bunch of people who used to -- literally -- have their fingers on the nuclear launch button (the ""missileers"" who sit in the silos waiting for the order to launch) wrote a letter stating in no uncertain terms that Donald Trump's finger should never be within reach of the nuclear button. Which isn't all that surprising, really, given the hordes of others who have said exactly the same thing.All of that happened in one week's time. And Trump is now increasingly resembling a wounded animal, whom everyone knows are the most dangerous, because with nothing left to lose they can viciously lash out in their death throes.And we've got over three weeks to go. Think we've hit bottom? Doubtful. Things can always go lower, folks. Next week will be the final debate, and it will likely be one for the ages.Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, was surprised by Barack Obama unexpectedly entering the Oval Office. Her response? ""Oh, hi Barack -- hey can you help me by holding up this tape measure? I want to get the window size right for the drapes I'm ordering.""We certainly look forward to seeing this week's Saturday Night Live, that's for sure.When we attended this year's Democratic National Convention, we rated all the speeches given -- on a purely subjective scale -- on how effective and heartfelt we felt all the speeches were. Vice President Joe Biden gave the best speech we've ever seen him give, and we immediately wrote an article begging Team Clinton to send him out on the campaign trail as a surrogate to trail Trump around the country. Biden's speech was that good.But we had to rank one speech -- out of the entire four nights -- above Biden's speech. Because First Lady Michelle Obama gave a downright extraordinary speech that no other speaker managed to top. We judged it the best of the whole convention -- better than Hillary Clinton's speech, better than Bill Clinton's speech, and better than Barack Obama's speech.Which is why we're not too surprised to be awarding Michelle Obama this week's Most Impressive Democrat Of The Week. Obama was out on the campaign trail for Hillary Clinton in Manchester, New Hampshire, and she delivered the most authentic and heartfelt repudiation of Donald Trump's attitude towards (and remarks about, and actions towards) women that has yet been heard.Obama reportedly had a lot to do with crafting this speech, which is obvious when you watch it. At times, she struggles to contain her emotions. She apparently was adamant about not just giving a standard ""vote for Hillary"" speech, but instead wanted to share her very personal thoughts about the disastrous week Trump has been having.She started by noting that earlier in the week she had helped celebrate ""International Day of the Girl"" at the White House. She then, without once mentioning him by name, ripped into Donald Trump:And now, here I am, out on the campaign trail in an election where we have consistently been hearing hurtful, hateful language about women -- language that has been painful for so many of us, not just as women, but as parents trying to protect our children and raise them to be caring, respectful adults, and as citizens who think that our nation's leaders should meet basic standards of human decency.The entire speech is worth reading (or, even better, watching on video). Michelle Obama is one of the most-respected people in politics today, and her outrage was palpable and very personal. She certainly minced no words in denouncing Trump's so-called locker-room banter:This is not normal. This is not politics as usual. This is disgraceful. It is intolerable. And it doesn't matter what party you belong to -- Democrat, Republican, independent -- no woman deserves to be treated this way. None of us deserves this kind of abuse.Review after review after review reached the same conclusion: Michelle Obama just gave one of the most powerful speeches of this entire election cycle. She deserves our thanks for doing so, and she has more than earned this week's Most Impressive Democrat Of The Week for giving such a heartfelt speech and for standing up for women, for decency, and against Donald Trump and his antediluvian attitudes towards women.[Congratulate First Lady Michelle Obama via her official White House contact page, to let her know you appreciate her efforts.]Julian Assange has been busily trying his best to torpedo Hillary Clinton's chances of becoming president, by leaking (on a daily basis) thousands of emails purportedly hacked from Hillary Clinton's campaign team. The likelihood that Russian hackers were the source of this information is high, and none of these leaked emails have been verified in any way.Assange must be spitting nails, though, because nobody's paying the slightest bit of attention. None of what has been revealed is any sort of smoking gun, which likely means he doesn't have anything worse than what he's already WikiLeaked. The leaked emails are swimming against a very powerful tide -- that of Donald Trump's absolute meltdown into misogyny.Even so, there have been embarrassing tidbits released, which is why we're giving the Most Disappointing Democrat Of The Week to John Podesta, chairman of Hillary Clinton's campaign. Podesta's emails (if accurate) are little more than how political insiders and consultants actually talk, behind closed doors. Opposition research is performed, Clinton's weaknesses are discussed in detail, and mildly offensive language is used, at times. Nothing really shocking about any of it, but then the public rarely sees such a peek behind the political curtain.If Trump hadn't been doing his impression of the Hindenburg this week, then maybe some of this might have captured the public's attention. However, given the scandalous competition, it barely even registered. Trump's woes are just so much more entertaining, after all.So John Podesta will likely survive the leaks, but he certainly didn't have a very happy week this week. Which makes him the obvious candidate for our Most Disappointing Democrat Of The Week.[John Podesta is running a political campaign right now, and our blanket policy is not to provide candidate website contact information, sorry.]Volume 412 (10/14/16)While we did award the prestigious MIDOTW award to Michelle Obama for her powerful speech this week, we also have to take note of a speech given by her husband in Columbus, Ohio. Because while Michelle's speech is certainly worth reading (or watching) and is one of the most heartfelt political speeches we've ever heard, Barack's speech was more appropriate to excerpt today as an extended talking point.Barack Obama has always been at his best giving political speeches out on the campaign trail. So it's no surprise he's been particularly good at it in support of Hillary Clinton this year. But yesterday's Columbus speech -- which many are already calling his ""Swamp Of Crazy"" speech -- not only tore into Donald Trump's obvious unfitness for the job, but also widely condemned the entire Republican Party for opportunistically fanning the flames of crazy for his entire term in office. Obama is bluntly placing all the blame for Trump squarely at the feet of Republicans who have benefited from the craziness without ever expecting it to come back to bite them. It is the most scathing takedown we've heard this entire election season, and that includes the Democratic National Convention speeches.Two technical notes are necessary, for context, before we get to the extended speech excerpt from Barack Obama. The first is that he was speaking in Ohio, in support not only of Hillary Clinton, but also in support of Ted Strickland, the Democrat running for U.S. Senate there. Obama, at one point, slams Strickland's opponent, Rob Portman. The second note is an editorial one -- we've removed what we felt were the extraneous ""(Applause.)"" and ""(Laughter.)"" notations from the transcript, although we left in the ones we felt were necessary to provide context for Obama's phrasing and rhythm. The full speech transcript (with all of the notations intact) can be read at Time magazine's website.President Barack Obama, speaking in Columbus, OhioLook, we know that most Republicans don't think the way Donald Trump does. Even in a banquet like this, full of hard-core Democrats. We have Republican friends, we've got Republican neighbors -- at the Little League game, soccer game. At the parent-teachers conference, we meet them. Some great people. We don't even think that most Republican politicians actually really believe that Donald Trump is qualified to be President. I know because they -- I talk to them. (Laughter.) They're all like, ""Man, this is really bad."" (Laughter.) ""We're just trying to get through this."" (Laughter.)But so the problem is not that all Republicans think the way this guy does. The problem is, is that they've been riding this tiger for a long time. They've been feeding their base all kinds of crazy for years -- primarily for political expedience. So if Trump was running around saying I wasn't born here, they were okay with that as long as it helped them with votes. If some of these folks on talk radio started talking about how I was the anti-Christ, you know, it's just politics. (Laughter.) You think I'm joking. (Laughter.)If somebody completely denies climate change, or is filled up with all kinds of conspiracy theories about how me and Hillary started ISIL, or that we were plotting to declare martial law and take away everybody's guns.We did a military exercise -- the Pentagon does these periodically in Texas, and suddenly all the folks in Texas were all like, ""They're going to take over right now!"" (Laughter.) I'm serious. And then the senator down there said, ""Yeah, we better look into that."" (Laughter.) And the governor says, ""Well, I don't know."" What do you mean you don't know? (Laughter.) What does that mean? (Applause.) Really? You think that like the entire Pentagon said: ""Oh, really, you want to declare martial law and take over Texas? Let's do it under the guise of routine training missions"" (Laughter.) -- and everybody is going to be -- but they took it seriously.This is in the swamp of crazy that has been fed over and over and over and over again. Look, I -- and there's sort of a spectrum, right -- it's a whole kind of ecosystem. And look, if I watched Fox News I wouldn't vote for me. (Laughter.) I understand. If I was listening to Rush Limbaugh, I'd say, ""Man, that's terrible."" (Laughter.) Fortunately, I have more diverse sources of information.And I want to make a serious point here -- because I'm really not exaggerating. Everything I'm saying are actual things that have been said and that people -- a fairly sizable number of people in the Republican primaries believe. And the people who knew better didn't say anything. They didn't say, ""Well, you know what, I disagree with his economic policies, but that goes too far."" They didn't say, ""Well, I'm not sure if his foreign policy is the right one for America, but we can't allow our politics to descend into the gutter.""People like Ted [Strickland]'s opponent -- they stood by while this happened. And Donald Trump, as he's prone to do, he didn't build the building himself, but he just slapped his name on it and took credit for it.And that's what's happened in their party. All that bile, all the exaggeration, all the stuff that was not grounded in fact just kind of bubbled up, started surfacing. They know better, a lot of these folks who ran, and they didn't say anything. And so they don't get credit for, at the very last minute, when finally the guy that they nominated and they endorsed and they supported is caught on tape saying things that no decent person would even think, much less say, much less brag about, much less laugh about or joke about, much less act on -- you can't wait until that finally happens and then say, ""Oh, that's too much, that's enough."" And think that somehow you are showing any kind of leadership and deserve to be elected to the United States Senate.You don't get points for that. In fact, I'm more forgiving of the people who actually believe it than the people who know better and stood silently by, out of political expediency, because it was politically convenient.And if your only organizing principle has been to block progress and block what we've tried to do to help the American people every step of the way, so you're not even consistent anymore -- you claim the mantle of the party of family values, and this is the guy you nominate? And stand by, and endorse, and campaign with until, finally, at the 11th hour you withdraw your nomination? You don't get credit for that.You're the party that is tough on foreign policy and opposes Russia -- and then you nominate this guy, whose role model is Vladimir Putin, the former head of the KGB? I'm sorry, what happened? (Laughter.) It's disappointing. It really is. Because, yes, I'm a Democrat, but I'm an American first. (Applause.) And I actually believe in a strong two-party system. And I think that the marketplace of ideas should have a reasonable, common-sense Republican Party debating a reasonable, common-sense Democratic Party. But that is not what we have right now.Chris Weigant blogs at:Follow Chris on Twitter: @ChrisWeigantFull archives of FTP columns: FridayTalkingPoints.comAll-time award winners leaderboard, by rank"

Tax cuts mean budget cuts, so what suffers is education, infrastructure and all kinds of things government does to make our lives better and our local businesses stronger.Republicans argue that pushing wealth and income to the top few has a ""trickle down"" effect. They say wealthy people (like Paris Hilton) are ""makers"" who ""create jobs"" and therefore deserve to have heaps of money pushed their way for their benefit. They say that government spending on things that make the lives of We the People better really just makes us into ""takers.""But in reality, policies that push more and more of our country's resources into the largest hands put our smaller hands at even more of a disadvantage. The giant corporations have huge advantages over small, local businesses just due to their size; huge tax breaks on top of their size-given advantages just make it that much harder for smaller businesses to compete. So the ""WalMart business model"" of undercutting and bankrupting a community's small businesses and draining entire regions of wealth gains even more power. After decades of these ""trickle down"" policies, this is also known as ""look around you.""Trump's Tax Plan Means Fewer Customers With Money To Spend At Local BusinessesThe Main Street Alliance is a ""is a national network of small business coalitions"" that ""works to provide small businesses a voice on the most pressing public policy issues across the nation."" (Donate here.)A Main Street Alliance blog post by Stephen Rouzer, ""Donald Trump's Revised Tax Plan Won't Work for Main Street,"" begins,The latest version of Donald Trump's ever-changing tax plan is facing scrutiny from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and Main Street Alliance leaders. The plan, one that features across the board tax cuts, disproportionately benefits the highest-income earners, those grossing more than $1 million annually.This description of Trump's plans as a huge benefit to the wealthiest is based on a Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP) post explaining a Tax Policy Center (TPC) analysis of Donald Trump's tax proposals. The CBPP post, ""Revised Trump Tax Plan Heavily Tilted Toward Wealthiest, Tax Policy Center Analysis Shows"" explains how the analysis shows that Trump's tax cut raise the after-tax income of the already-wealthy by another 14% or more, while hardly benefiting the rest of us - or even cutting the take-home incomes of the poorest.This would seriously affect small, local businesses. Rouzer explains how passing so much to the top few while starving the rest of us means local businesses have fewer customers with money to spend:A 2015 report released by the Main Street Alliance, ""Voices of Main Street,"" surveyed over 1000 small business owners and found that 52 percent of respondents cited ""more customers"" as the most important key to increasing small business success. Doubling the number of respondents that said ""lower taxes"" and more than quadrupling the number that responded ""fewer regulations.""Rouzer concludes with some great comments from business owners:""To level the playing field for Main Street businesses our tax code must no longer skew in favor of large corporations and their shareholders,"" said Deborah Field, the owner of Paperjam Press in Portland, Oregon, and a former corporate tax accountant. ""Without holding multinational corporations accountable to pay what they owe and first providing relief to low and middle-income earners we shouldn't begin to consider tax cuts for the rich.""Amanda Ballantyne, national director of the Main Street Alliance, says that ""Mr. Trump's tax breaks would deprive the government of badly needed funds for investments in infrastructure, transportation, education, and social services. The resulting budget cuts hinder the types of investments that drive local economies and put small businesses in a better position to succeed.""The kind of tax policy that small businesses need is one that supports their customer base and their communities. ""In that regard, Trump's plan falls flat,"" says Ballantyne.Donald Trump wants to dramatically cut taxes for the already-wealthy and their giant corporations. This would starve local communities of resources like teachers and infrastructure, while stacking the deck further against smaller, local businesses. -------This post originally appeared at Campaign for America's Future (CAF) at their Blog for OurFuture.

12,WOMEN,The Simple Reason This Trump Accuser Decided To Come Forward,Alanna Vagianos,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-simple-reason-summer-zervos-trump-accuser-decided-to-come-forward_us_58013056e4b0e8c198a80df3,Summer Zervos just wants to be able to sleep at night.,2016-10-14,Attorney Gloria Allred (left) and Summer Zervos (right) at Friday afternoon's news conference in LA. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/580132311b0000df1cef72f3.jpeg?cache=cPWQSaDO67&ops=crop_8_239_3854_2093%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"On Friday afternoon, another woman came forward with accusations of sexual assault against Donald Trump.During a press conference, with attorney Gloria Allred by her side, former “Apprentice” contestant Summer Zervos said Trump brought her to a hotel room and tried to force himself on her in 2007. Zervos said she met Trump twice in 2007, once in New York at his office, where she says he allegedly kissed her twice without consent. The second time she met Trump that year was in Los Angeles at the Beverly Hills Hotel, where he allegedly “grabbed” her breasts, kissed her “very aggressively, thrusted his genitals at her and invited her to lay down on the bed with him. When she pushed him away, Zervos said Trump asked her what she wanted to do. “I said I came to have dinner,” she replied, in her statement. “He said ‘OK, we will have dinner.’ He paced around the room. He acted like he was a bit angry.”Zervos, who is the 11th woman to come forward with allegations of sexual assault, harassment, or misconduct against Trump in the last week, was visibly shaken while delivering her statement to press.Towards the end of the press conference, Allred said the former “Apprentice” contestant would not be answering questions but that Allred would field a few from reporters. After she took a couple of questions, one reporter asked Allred: “What does [Zervos] hope comes out of coming forward?” As Allred began to answer, Zervos cut in and said she would like to answer this question herself. “I want to be able to sleep when I’m 70 at night,” Zervos said. “That’s my answer.”When another reporter later asked Zervos how she felt when making her statement, she responded: “This is a new experience, there’s a lot of emotions going on.” Watch a short clip from the press conference below.

13,POLITICS,Donald Trump Is Probably Past The Point Of No Return,Natalie Jackson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-losing_us_58011fb9e4b0162c043bd4fb,"The GOP nominee's numbers haven't dropped much in the past week, but he was already losing.",2016-10-14,There's not even enough space for Trump's headshot in the red segment.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58012093170000bc16acc0a2.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The evidence is still coming in, but polls so far suggest that the tape of Donald Trump discussing sexual assault and the ensuing accusations didn’t cause support for the GOP presidential nominee to collapse.Instead, the week’s events seem to have reinforced a downward trend that started at the beginning of the month. He’s unlikely to recover, and Trump’s odds of winning on Nov. 8 are less than 1 in 10, according to HuffPost’s projections.According to HuffPost Pollster’s trend for the two-way Hillary Clinton vs. Trump race, Trump’s numbers began dropping at the end of September after briefly rising as high as 43 percent. He’s at just under 41 percent now ― a small but significant decline. In polls including third-party candidates, there’s been essentially no movement: Trump is stuck between 38 and 39 percent. There have been a few alarm bells. Utah is one of them. Two polls out this week show Trump in a close race with Democratic nominee Clinton and conservative independent candidate Evan McMullin. Republicans typically win the state by large margins. And presidential forecasts show declines in Trump’s chances of winning over the last week. When The Huffington Post’s presidential forecast model debuted on Oct. 3, Clinton had an 84 percent chance of winning, leaving Trump only a 16 percent chance of becoming president. Now, 11 days later, Trump’s chances are in the single digits. Clinton has a 91 percent chance of winning. The model gives her 341 electoral votes to Trump’s 197. Trump’s lower chances in the forecast stem from small shifts in polls across several states. Despite the poll changes in Utah, it’s still classified as a likely Trump win. Other states have seen small ― but important ― shifts toward Clinton. Michigan and Wisconsin are now over 90 percent likely to go to Clinton, which gives her 273 electoral votes just among states that she is 90 percent or more likely to win. Florida has gotten a bit bluer and has an 89 percent chance of going to Clinton. Ohio, North Carolina and Nevada have made small changes to now lean in the Democratic direction. Ohio and Nevada were leaning toward Trump last week.These movements are small, but make no mistake ― Trump is in big trouble. No candidate has ever come back from a polling deficit this large to win the election. The 91 percent probability of a Clinton win 25 days out are as high as forecast probabilities were of Barack Obama winning the day before the election in 2012. These numbers could ― and probably will ― change between now and Election Day. It’s possible that Trump’s numbers won’t fall any further and might even increase slightly simply because he’s already this far down. Trump’s ardent supporters are happy to accept his explanation of the tape as “locker room” talk and “just words” in order to vote for the party line. If the controversy quiets down, some less strident supporters might come back as we’ve seen happen after previous Trump scandals.But the numbers aren’t likely to come back up much. For one thing, the Trump campaign isn’t showing any signs of trying to repair the damage. They seem to be in complete denial that they’re losing this race, falling back on the adage that “the only poll that matters is the one on Election Day.” Trump falsely claimed on Thursday that the polls show a “dead heat.” Vice presidential nominee Mike Pence told Fox News’ Brian Kilmeade “I think these polls have been all over the map. I honestly think there’s something missing in the polling these days.” When pressed on what he meant, Pence cited large crowds at campaign rallies as his evidence that the polls are missing the mark.Crowd size means nothing. Polls do, and that’s a bad thing for Donald Trump.

Certainly not if owner Jerry Jones had his way. Flashback to the NFL Draft this past May and it was University of Memphis quarterback Paxton Lynch ― not Prescott ― whom the polarizing owner was targeting. Lynch, a 6-foot-7-inch flamethrower with a 36-inch vertical jump, offered more upside, at least in Jones’ eyes. But Denver general manager John Elway nabbed Lynch with the 26th pick overall, and the Cowboys then selected Prescott in the fourth round.“I probably should have overpaid here,” Jones said at the time, regretting that he didn’t do a deal with Seattle to obtain the needed first-round pick. He was “still mad about it,” he said. Either way, the Cowboys entered the 2016 season with Tony Romo, a 36-year-old quarterback who had already endured multiple back surgeries. Romo was armed with the league’s premier offensive line and a fleet of weapons, namely wide receiver Dez Bryant and rookie running back Ezekiel Elliott. Then the increasingly frail quarterback was injured in a preseason game against Seattle, and Prescott was pushed into a starting role. The rookie quarterback, who came from a read-option and shotgun-based offense at Mississippi State, has proved to be a revelation. While Lynch has struggled in a limited role with Denver, his counterpart has led the Cowboys to four consecutive wins while breaking the rookie record with 155 pass attempts and zero interceptions.“You can tell that the players respect the heck out of him and that he’s already a leader,” Cowboys Hall of Fame quarterback Roger Staubach told ESPN. “He makes good, solid decisions. I think we’ve got a wonderful quarterback for the future.”But that’s just it: The future is now.Whether Dallas is a legitimate Super Bowl contender this season remains to be seen, but it’s hard to argue that this isn’t a better team with Prescott at the helm. The Cowboys aren’t just winning with Prescott ― who had actually been recruited by most SEC schools as a tight end ― but rather because of him.That’s why it was such a shock when Jones said last Sunday, “Tony [Romo] is our No. 1 quarterback.”Remember, too, that the 23-year-old Prescott has completed 69 percent of his passes to go along with seven touchdowns (four passing, three rushing). His staggering 83.7 total QBR is second only to that of Atlanta’s MVP candidate, veteran Matt Ryan.Like Philadelphia rookie Carson Wentz ― who has also been sensational ― Prescott has displayed the rare ability to make solid pre-snap reads and not send the ball into hidden coverage.“He is amazing at making decisions when ... there’s a difficult situation there and he needs to dump the ball off,” Staubach said.Romo’s brilliant career is obviously what makes the decision for Jones and head coach Jason Garrett so difficult. And yet, on the “what have you done for me lately” question, the four-time Pro Bowler comes up very short. He hasn’t completed a full 16-game season since 2012, and he’s now on the wrong side of 30.Prescott, for his part, has said all of the right things.“This is Tony’s team,” Prescott said via the Cowboys’ official website. “I knew that going into the situation.

16,POLITICS,Parents Really Don't Want Their Kids Looking Up To Donald Trump,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-role-model-children_us_580142e4e4b0e8c198a83124,But most don't think their children are particularly bothered by the election.,2016-10-14,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump addresses supporters during a campaign rally in Cincinnati, Ohio, this week. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/580143e11b0000df1cef7342.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The most recent presidential debate started off with an age-old political appeal: Think of the children.“The last debate could have been rated as MA, mature audiences, per TV parental guidelines,” Patrice Brock, an undecided voter, said as she addressed Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. “Knowing that educators assign viewing the presidential debates as students’ homework, do you feel you’re modeling appropriate and positive behavior for today’s youth?”The answer, according to the nation’s parents? Not really.Neither presidential nominee is seen by a majority of parents as a good role model, according to a HuffPost/YouGov poll, but Trump raises substantially more concerns. The survey was taken after a tape of Trump bragging about sexual assault was published last Friday, but before newer accusations about his conduct came to light.A 75 percent majority of Americans who have kids under the age of 18 say Trump is not a good role model for children, while just 12 percent say he is. In contrast, opinions on Clinton are about evenly split, with 42 percent saying she is a good role model and 43 percent saying she isn’t. GOP parents are considerably less likely to want their children looking up to their party’s nominee. While nearly 7 in 10 Democratic and Democratic-leaning parents think Clinton is a good role model, fewer than one-quarter of Republican and Republican-leaning parents say the same about Trump.Americans as a whole say by a 52-point margin that Trump isn’t a good role model, and by an 11-point margin that Clinton isn’t either.Even if they don’t want to see their children grow up emulating Trump, however, most parents aren’t too concerned about the effect the election is having on their kids.Forty-nine percent of parents say they’re “very comfortable” talking with their kids about the election, while 86 percent are at least somewhat comfortable doing so.A small group ― 11 percent ― say their kids are disturbed or upset by the elections.“My 16-year-old son is afraid that Donald Trump will start WWIII with the Muslims and all of the boys his age will be drafted into military service,” one Democratic parent said in response to the survey. “My 11-year-old daughter is frightened every time they put Trump on TV.”“They do not like any of the choices available,” a Republican parent wrote. “Everyone is rude to one another and no one really answers the questions.”However, 50 percent of parents say their kids are aware of the election but not troubled by it, while 28 percent say their kids aren’t paying much attention at all, and 11 percent aren’t sure what their kids think.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Oct. 8-Oct. 10 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov’s nationally representative opinion polling. Data from all HuffPost/YouGov polls can be found here. More details on the polls’ methodology are available here.Most surveys report a margin of error that represents some, but not all, potential survey errors. YouGov’s reports include a model-based margin of error, which rests on a specific set of statistical assumptions about the selected sample, rather than the standard methodology for random probability sampling. If these assumptions are wrong, the model-based margin of error may also be inaccurate.

17,POLITICS,"GOP Gymnastics Over Trump Reveal Deeper Failings, New Ad Argues",Michael McAuliff,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kelly-ayotte-donald-trump-ad_us_580128e8e4b06e047594baea,The spot says Sen. Kelly Ayotte's contortions prove the depth of her political calculation.,2016-10-14,Sen. Kelly Ayotte has twisted herself in knots to explain her willingness to vote for Donald Trump.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/580132701a000067145b9947.jpeg?cache=xcj5Lf5YS9&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― As gross as Donald Trump’s boasting about violating women was, a new ad argues that the revelation of his predatory predilections has revealed a deeper issue ― the craven political calculation of Republicans trying to navigate their own re-elections.In this case, in a spot set to be released Friday, New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan (D) targets her Senate race rival, Republican incumbent Kelly Ayotte.For months, Ayotte took the difficult position of criticizing or being silent on Trump’s comments against immigrants and Muslims, among other issues, while still supporting his presidential candidacy.But with the emergence of video of Trump declaring he likes to kiss women and grab their genitals without their consent, Ayotte was among those Republicans who tried to put a little more distance between herself and her party’s standard-bearer.Hassan’s campaign argues that Ayotte’s conversion is too late and too convenient. In the new ad, they contend that her shift on Trump is emblematic of a deeper “political calculation.”“Months of degrading women and vulgar insults, and Kelly Ayotte supported Donald Trump through all of it, even calling him a role model,” the ad’s narrator says, referring to comments the senator made, and then retracted, about Trump “absolutely” being a model for kids.“Now Ayotte suddenly claims the opposite. A political calculation just to re-elect herself,” the ad says.It goes on to allege that Ayotte makes similar calculations in other areas.“From voting with the Koch brothers nearly 90 percent of the time in her first four years in office, to her political maneuvering on Donald Trump, Kelly Ayotte has spent her Washington career looking out for her own political interests while the people and small businesses of New Hampshire paid the price,” said Hassan spokeswoman Meira Bernstein in a statement. “Granite Staters know they can’t trust Ayotte to do what’s right for them if it doesn’t fit into her political strategy, and voters across the political spectrum will see right through Ayotte’s finger-to-the-wind efforts to save her own seat,” Bernstein added.Every Democratic campaign these days is attempting to tie its opponent to Trump. But Hassan’s team is trying to go a step further and argue that the reason a Republican’s positioning is so tortured on Trump is that more broadly their political positions are more important to them than the underlying realities or policies.The New Hampshire Senate contest is one of the tightest in the nation.Watch the ad here:The Ayotte campaign responded later Friday by touting its senator’s work across the aisle and by accusing Hassan’s squad of essentially cribbing their new attack from the Democratic Party brain trust in Washington:Kelly is ranked as one of the most bipartisan senators because she has a strong record of working across the aisle to do what’s right for New Hampshire ― including passing legislation to address the heroin epidemic, protecting our environment, and helping lead an end to the government shutdown. By repeating mind-numbing, recycled attacks from her Washington party bosses, Governor Hassan has refused to run a race based on the issues that are important to New Hampshire and it’s becoming increasingly clear that her strategy has failed.This story has been updated with a response from the Ayotte campaign.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
18,POLITICS,Ferguson Officer Investigation Shows Just How Far The Police Force Has To Go,Mariah Stewart,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ferguson-officials-are-reviewing-the-tweets-of-a-police-officer-they-just-hired_us_57fe94bfe4b0162c04399c16,The city's newest cop has come under fire for problematic tweets.,2016-10-14,"Protestors hold signs as they rally in 2014 against the grand jury exoneration of Officer Darren Wilson for the shooting and killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. The city is still struggling to fill open jobs in its police force.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5800444c1b0000e218ef7010.jpeg?cache=naEdvIYNXW&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"FERGUSON, Mo. ― Two years after a police shooting drew national attention to this St. Louis suburb, the Ferguson Police Department is struggling to fill open positions on the force. And an investigation into its latest recruit shows just how difficult that process can be.In 2014, the year Officer Darren Wilson killed 18-year-old Michael Brown, the Ferguson Police Department had 54 sworn police officers. Now, it’s down to 39 ― six black men, two black women and 27 white men.The city’s head police dispatcher resigned during a city council meeting in August, saying budgets and staffing constraints led to her decision. She also said the police department was so dangerously understaffed that someone could be hurt as a result. At that same meeting, newly appointed Police Chief Delrish Moss agreed that new hires were needed, but said he wanted to be sure he hired the right candidates. But the latest police force hire, a white man who was sworn in during a city council meeting on Tuesday night along with a new police commander, city clerk and city attorney, is already drawing the ire of local activists Emily Davis and Keith Rose, who shared a series of tweets from an account bearing the officer’s name.The tweets discussed a video that went viral in 2015 and showed a McKinney, Texas, police officer chasing teens at a pool party, wrestling a bikini-clad teenage girl to the ground, pointing a gun toward two boys and performing a barrel roll. The officer in the video, Eric Casebolt, resigned immediately after the incident, and White House officials called his actions “detrimental” to police-community relations.The person who wrote the tweets apparently didn’t see it that way. “[P]olice tell you to comply, you comply!” said one. “[T]his is typical for people not to listen to police.”The account also contained transphobic comments. One response to a post by Kim Kardashian urging people to follow Caitlyn Jenner on Twitter said, “your whole family is sickening and I can’t believe he won that award,” referring to Jenner’s Arthur Ashe Courage Award at the ESPYS last year. The tweet used the gender pronoun “he” to refer to Jenner, who now identifies as female.The account, and a Facebook page under the same name, have both since been deleted.In any other municipality, hiring a police officer wouldn’t make national news. But here, everything officers do is under a microscope, including their social media profiles.Ferguson Mayor James Knowles immediately responded to the activists’ concerns, and asked Rose to leave printouts of the tweets with the city clerk. City spokesman Jeff Small said in an email that the department is working to verify the tweets.“[A]lthough he was not an officer at the time, the concerns raised by the revelation of the account are now a personnel matter,” Small wrote. “Due to the fact that it is a personnel matter the departmental inquiry cannot be discussed as a matter of law.”In 2015, the Justice Department concluded that Ferguson’s police officers regularly engaged in unconstitutional policing, targeting the black community to drive up revenue for the city. “Just as officers reflexively resort to arrest immediately upon noncompliance with their orders, whether lawful or not, they are quick to overreact to challenges and verbal slights,” the department wrote. “These incidents ― sometimes called ‘contempt of cop’ cases ― are propelled by officers’ belief that arrest is an appropriate response to disrespect.”Now, a consent decree between the city and the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division requires officers to go through more intensive training than cops in neighboring cities.St. Louis County, in contrast, has dozens of separate police forces, and many offer higher salaries than Ferguson currently provides.Despite the city’s apparent struggles with filling open officer positions, the tweets didn’t sit well with locals. Ferguson resident Emily Davis said the city shouldn’t be hiring someone who believes the McKinney police officer handled the situation in an appropriate way.“The police chief of McKinney, Texas, called that officer’s actions ‘indefensible,’ and do you know who’s defending those actions? … [The officer] who we hired. That’s problematic,” Davis said.Ferguson’s population is more than 67 percent African-American, but it wasn’t until last year that more than one black person served on the city council. All of the new hires sworn in Thursday, other than the new officer, are black.Apollo Carey, the new city attorney, says he’s looking forward to his new position in Ferguson. He’ll be replacing Stephanie Karr, who was accused of misconduct in the Justice Department report and had long been a target of activists.“I’m obviously excited and happy to be a part of the team,” Carey said. “I want to be a part of moving things forward.”But days before Tuesday’s council meeting, former Ferguson City Council candidate Adrienne Hawkins told HuffPost she believes “not much has changed” in terms of progress within the city.“Other than the skin color on faces, what has really changed?” asked Hawkins, who now lives in the neighboring city of Florissant. “I don’t see any progress. I think protesters have grown a little weary.

But even as she prepared to formally announce her presidential bid, she resisted entreaties from several staffers to have her husband, former President Bill Clinton, cancel one last speech to Morgan Stanley.The Clinton campaign did not directly respond to a request for comment on the internal communications, but pointed to a conference call in which campaign advisors said that the WikiLeaks emails had been hacked by the Russian government, which is believed to be trying to tilt the U.S. election in favor of GOP nominee Donald Trump. The FBI has supported the Clinton campaign’s assertions about Russian involvement in the email hack.The internal emails reveal Clinton staffers’ attempts to reason with a wealthy political candidate who didn’t appreciate the potential damage that could be done if her husband ― referred to as “WJC” in the communications ― spoke to a prominent Wall Street firm just three days after she formally announced her presidential campaign.Staffers knew that Clinton didn’t want to hear it, and maneuvered to make their objections understood.“HRC very strongly did not want him to cancel that particular speech,” wrote Clinton aide Huma Abedin on March 11, 2015. “I think if John [Podesta] is getting involved in this scheduling matter, he must feel strongly. I will have to tell her that WJC chose to cancel it, not that we asked.”“Yes the issue is that if we’re announcing on the 12th/13th and he’s speaking to a wall street bank on the 15th, that’s begging for a bad rollout,” campaign manager Robby Mook replied. Six and a half hours later, Abedin delivered the bad news to Mook and Podesta, a longtime Clinton confidante: “John and Robby – HRC is reiterating her original position. She does not want him to cancel.”Two hours after Abedin delivered the news about her boss’ resistance, Mook put his foot down.“I know this is not the answer she wants, but I feel very strongly that doing the speech is a mistake ― the data are very clear on the potential consequences. It will be three days after she’s announced and on her first day in Iowa, where caucus [goers] have a sharply more negative view of Wall Street than the rest of the electorate. Wall Street ranks first for Iowans among a list of institutions that “take advantage of every day Americans”, scoring twice as high as the general election electorate. I recognize the sacrifice and [disappointment] that cancelling will create, but it’s a very consequential unforced error and could plague us in stories for months.”“People would (rightfully) ask how we let it happen,” Mook continued. “I would suggest that if she is determined to keep this speech that she talk with John [because] this is a very big deal in my view.”By the following afternoon, Clinton was willing to listen to reason.“Robby – Just raised with her again,” Abedin wrote. “We are good to cancel esp if WJC is ok with it. Just needed a cool down period.” Stories from Hillary Clinton’s 2008 campaign are filled with accounts of backbiting nastiness between power-hungry staffers. But this episode portrays a staff unified in political acumen against a stubborn candidate. When the primary season began in earnest, Clinton’s paid speeches to Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank and other major Wall Street firms became a central point of controversy. Had Clinton not drawn a racist, xenophobic general election challenger who has boasted about committing sexual assault, these talks likely would have remained an issue into November.The Clintons made a combined $6.7 million in speaking fees in 2015. They brought in about $20 million in speaking fees the year before. It’s hard to blame Clinton’s staffers for wondering why they needed one more talk."
22,POLITICS,"The Feds Are Going To Collect Better Data On Police Killings, But We Probably Won't See It",Ryan J. Reilly and Nick Wing,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/justice-department-police-data_us_58010b1fe4b0e8c198a7c425,"Collecting more data is a start, but it might not give the public a better understanding of the problem.",2016-10-14,The federal government should know -- and tell us -- how many people police kill each year. But the public needs to know more than just that.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58010b5c1a00006e145b9859.jpeg?cache=JwRgdKDQj6&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Justice Department officials outlined plans this week to expand nationwide data collection on fatal police interactions and use-of-force incidents. But due to limitations on what the government is allowed to publish, there are big questions about just how useful the data will be to the general public.The proposed initiatives include a National Use of Force Data Collection program, under which law enforcement agencies would voluntarily submit information on civilians and officers involved in use-of-force incidents ― as well as other relevant details surrounding these encounters. A pilot program led by the FBI is set to begin in early 2017.The Justice Department also announced it had completed an initial step in its effort to compile more robust death-in-custody data from federal, state and local law enforcement agencies.In August, the Bureau of Justice Statistics, a branch of the Justice Department, published a notice in the Federal Register detailing reporting expectations of law enforcement under the Death in Custody Reporting Act. The DCRA ― reauthorized in 2014, months after the fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri ― was meant to prompt the government to gather official statistics on the number of people killed by police each year. Under the legislation, the attorney general can levy financial penalties on departments that fail to report. But those penalties can only be used against law enforcement agencies that don’t report deaths; they do not apply to agencies that fail to report data on non-deadly use-of-force incidents.The updated DCRA guidelines ask the nation’s 19,450 state and local law enforcement agencies and nearly 700 medical examiner’s or coroner’s offices to submit an expanded set of details about in-custody deaths. This information includes the decedent’s name, demographics, behavior and mental health status, as well as the precipitating events, such as the reason for initial contact and other actions by responding officers. The blueprint also calls for departments to provide quarterly summaries with any arrest-related deaths that haven’t been reported. A coalition of civil rights organizations had previously criticized the Justice Department’s data collection process, questioning its reliance on news reports and failure to sufficiently pressure agencies to report deaths voluntarily. The groups expressed concerns that this would leave a gap between the number of deaths the federal government has been recording and the number of deaths that actually occur. Previous official counts that relied on voluntary reporting by police had placed the total number of “justifiable homicides” around 400 each year. Subsequent reporting from independent sources suggests the total annual death toll is closer to 1,000.There’s also a larger problem with the data collected by federal authorities: There are limits on what they’re allowed to publish. Agencies are banned from publishing certain personally identifiable details about the deaths they count, and in the past have published only aggregate data that provide little more than a raw number of incidents nationwide or on the state level. That makes it impossible to identify which jail facilities, for example, have unusually high death rates.In practice, that means the data published by the federal government will never be as comprehensive or accessible as the information that has been recently published by media organizations. A tracker by The Guardian that includes all fatal encounters with police estimates that at least 847 people have been killed by police this year. A separate count from The Washington Post that tracks only shootings states that at least 754 people have been fatally shot by police so far in 2016. The government’s vague presentation of these types of data can have a sanitizing effect. Take the case of Michael Sabbie, whose July 2015 death was recently covered by The Huffington Post as part of our effort to track all jail deaths across the country in the year after Sandra Bland died in Texas. Sabbie begged guards at the Bi State Jail on the border of Texas and Arkansas for help in the hours before his death, telling them he couldn’t breathe at least 19 times. But when Sabbie’s death eventually shows up in published federal statistics, he’ll likely simply show up as an inmate who died of a heart condition, regardless of the fact that his death was almost certainly preventable. Still, the Justice Department hopes the new guidelines will show a commitment to addressing anxiety over police violence and use of force, which disproportionately affect people of color. “The initiatives we are announcing today are vital efforts toward increasing transparency and building trust between law enforcement and the communities we serve,” Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in a statement. “In the days ahead, the Department of Justice will continue to work alongside our local, state, tribal and federal partners to ensure that we put in place a system to collect data that is comprehensive, useful and responsive to the needs of the communities we serve.”Several thousand interested parties contacted the Justice Department during the open comment period for its DCRA proposal, which ended last week. It is now reviewing that input and will issue an updated proposal soon.The federal government has been laying groundwork for an expanded tracking effort over the past year.Speaking last October, FBI Director James Comey called the current lack of federal data on police killings “embarrassing,” while admitting that unofficial sources had access to more accurate information than the government.Several independent trackers have compiled their own counters in lieu of federal data. Fatal Encounters is attempting to build a database of police killings going back to the beginning of 2000. Killed By Police has used news reports to track police killings since 2013.Julia Craven contributed reporting."

Back in April, he underwent a bone marrow transplant from his sister Ashley, however he died of complications from the procedure. Judi Peters told HuffPost that her son brought people together during his fight with cancer. His classmates’ beautiful gesture is just proof of his lasting impact on those around him. “His journey inspired a community to pull together in the face of childhood cancer awareness,” she said. “His legacy will live on in so many ways.

During the nearly 90-minute call, newly minted CEO Timothy J. Sloan offered few details about how the banking giant planned to change its ways. He repeatedly avoided answering questions about the scandal by citing an ongoing probe by independent investigators hired by the board of directors. “We want to be very respectful of their process,” said Sloan, who was promoted just 48 hours earlier, after the sudden departure of his predecessor, John Stumpf. “We want that process to be taken seriously and to be viewed independently. I don’t want to comment on the specifics about how they’re going to go about their review.” He repeated a version of that answer multiple times, despite saying he did not know whether the board planned to publicly release the findings of the investigation. Some financial analysts on the call weren’t having it. “We can’t ask who knew what and when, we can’t ask why it took so long to stop the problem,” said Mike Mayo, a banking analyst at brokerage giant CLSA. “Can you give us something concrete that relates to all of this?”Sloan, audibly irritated, shot back: “I’m sorry we’ve disappointed you, but we’ve just spent 30 minutes talking about what’s going on at the company, and we’ve provided a lot of information.”“We deliberately and diligently walked through the performance of all our businesses,” he added. “If that doesn’t satisfy you, I’m sorry.”Sloan also deflected questions about negative press reports on the company.“I don’t mean to be disrespectful to the media, but I don’t know if they have all the facts,” he said. “The review will look at all the facts and will make some recommendations, for sure.” Last month, the San Francisco-based bank, the country’s third-largest by assets, fired at least 5,300 retail employees it blamed for meeting unattainable sales goals by opening up to 2 million checking accounts without customers’ knowledge. During the call, Sloan said the company planned to find ways to retain its remaining workers.“Saying that we put our team members through the ringer is an understatement,” he said, echoing the wording of an analyst’s question. “We’ve got to re-recruit our team in this kind of environment,” he added. “All ideas are on the table.” Sloan, a 29-year veteran of the bank who had not previously worked in the scandal-struck retail division, took over on Wednesday after serving for less than a year as chief operating offer. The 56-year-old was widely seen as being groomed for the top spot.But Stumpf’s sudden departure on Wednesday ― billed as an early retirement ― hastened the process after the 63-year-old took the fall for a scandal that has already cost the company $190 million in settlement fees. During congressional hearings last month, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) repeatedly skewered Stumpf, calling for him to resign and be “criminally investigated.”The bank ultimately clawed back Stumpf’s $41 million in unvested stock, forced him to give up his $2.8 million annual salary and denied him any bonus.

She has a complicated history and is generally suspicious of those around her.”Sound familiar? It seems like Eleven might find herself a buddy next season. Montgomery, of “Power Rangers,” will fill the shoes of “Billy, Max’s hyper-confident, and edgy older step-brother. He steals girlfriends away from their boyfriends, is great at drinking games, and drives a black Camaro. But lurking under his apparent charisma, is a violent and unpredictable nature.”Whereas Max sounds like a less otherworldly version of Eleven, Billy sounds like a darker version of Steve, who managed to circumvent the ‘80s bad-boyfriend trope by overcoming his bias against Jonathan and showing himself to be a pretty decent dude. Billy, however, may not be so inclined. (Could that earn him a visit to the Upside Down?)Per the Duffer brothers, who created the series, there will be four new characters next season ― so look out for another two newbies in the coming months. Other details are scarce, but the brothers recently told IGN that Season 2, set to debut in mid-to-late 2017, will likely “explore the repercussions of everything that happened” in Season 1.And yes, fans, you have been heard ― there will be justice for Barb.

29,POLITICS,Florida's Death Penalty Law Is Ruled Unconstitutional — Again,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/florida-death-penalty_us_5801066de4b06e04759473b3,The state's supreme court ruled that a jury must be unanimous when imposing a death sentence.,2016-10-14,"After the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Florida's death penalty law as unconstitutional, state legislators attempted to fix it.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/580108391b0000df1cef720f.jpeg?cache=8YfCfwOUz0&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Florida’s highest court ruled on Friday that the state’s recently amended death penalty law is unconstitutional because it doesn’t require jurors to be unanimous when imposing the punishment.State legislators rushed to fix the statute earlier this year after the U.S. Supreme Court declared that the old sentencing regime violated the federal Constitution’s right to an impartial jury.The Florida Supreme Court acknowledged Friday that most of the fixes passed the test and “can be construed constitutionally,” but that the provision allowing a less-than-unanimous jury to recommend a death sentence did not.The new law “is unconstitutional because it requires that only ten jurors recommend death as opposed to the constitutionally required unanimous, twelve-member jury,” the court said. “Accordingly, it cannot be applied to pending prosecutions.”The court’s majority frowned on the contested provision largely because Florida law requires unanimity from jurors during other parts of the sentencing process ― including agreement on critical facts that may justify the imposition of a death sentence.In practice, the ruling means that there is no available law or procedure for prosecutors seeking the death penalty ― and the Florida legislature may again rush to pass a quick fix.“We think we won,” attorney Frank Bankowitz said in an email. Bankowitz is one of the defense lawyers for Larry Darnell Perry, a first-degree murder defendant for whom prosecutors had requested a capital trial. Relying on the Supreme Court’s earlier ruling, Perry sought to challenge that decision.All but one of the court’s members joined the ruling. Justice Charles Canady ― notably one of Donald Trump’s many pre-nominees to the nation’s high court if he is elected president ― disagreed with his colleagues’ conclusions about the offending provision.In a separate decision issued the same day, the state court also granted a new sentencing hearing to Timothy Hurst, the man at the center of the Supreme Court case decided in January. He was convicted in 1998 for the murder of a co-worker at a Popeye’s restaurant.One question the new ruling doesn’t answer is what happens to all the inmates sentenced under a regime that has now twice been deemed constitutionally defective. Could a death row inmate who was condemned by a non-unanimous jury now challenge that sentence and request a new sentencing hearing?It’s an issue that is sure to lead to more litigation, as Florida has the second-largest death row population in the United States.This story has been updated with comment from Frank Bankowitz."
30,GREEN,Most Farmers Still Doubt They Have Anything To Do With Climate Change,Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/farmers-climate-change-hurricane-matthew_us_58000642e4b0e8c198a734d1,"Devastation from extreme weather events like Hurricane Matthew isn't changing their minds, either.",2016-10-14,The flooding caused by Hurricane Matthew has been responsible for 26 deaths in the state of North Carolina.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587c4c23170000880192a3f6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"To say it’s been a busy harvest season for North Carolina farmer Peyton McDaniel would be an incredible understatement.It’s been several days since Hurricane Matthew brought heavy rains to the state that killed at least 22 people, but farmers throughout eastern North Carolina and other regions the storm impacted are still racing to salvage as much of their crops as they can and minimize their losses.For McDaniel, that’s meant a typical five- or six-day work week at his family’s 2,000-acre farm operation in the town of Whitakers has become a round-the-clock, seven-day affair marked by 18-hour work days navigating muddy fields and flooded roads. The 26-year-old is exhausted.All the extra rainfall caused many of McDaniel’s crops, like his cotton and peanuts, to germinate early. He expects both crops to take a major hit due to the storm. He also anticipates that his sweet potatoes, still submerged in muck, to suffer immensely. If they stay there too long, they’ll rot.“Right now, we’re doing the best we can,” McDaniel told The Huffington Post by phone Thursday. “This year might not be the year that everybody is running to the bank, but the bank may be running after you.”McDaniel is not alone. It is also feared that millions of livestock have died in storm-related flooding. And state agriculture officials expect the impact of the storm will be felt for some time to come, causing millions of dollars in losses.Hurricane Matthew is just one of many extreme weather events that has had a tremendous effect on U.S. farmers’ operations this year.In the Northeast region, farmers have struggled with the worst drought they’ve seen in more than a decade. Historic flooding in southeast Louisiana caused an estimated $110 million in agriculture losses. And farmers in California are still dealing with the ongoing drought as it enters its sixth year, costing the state’s industry some $600 million this year.While no one weather event can be directly tied to climate change, an increasing number of scientists are describing a link between our warming planet and extreme weather like droughts and floods. A report released last fall from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine claimed that climate change is making events like these both more common and more extreme. A National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration came to a similar conclusion in its analysis of 2014 extreme weather and climate events.For his part, McDaniel doesn’t think climate change had anything to do with the devastation brought to his farm. His family has been farming its land since 1756 and has seen all sorts of weather across all those decades, he noted.“I don’t think you can point to global warming or a manmade problem on this,” McDaniel added. “It’s more of a cyclical thing.”The minimal amount of existing research on the topic shows that most farmers would probably agree with McDaniel, even though their industry is both uniquely vulnerable to extreme weather and a significant source of climate change-causing greenhouse gases.Many farmers would agree that weather patterns are changing and extreme weather is increasing, but most don’t think these have anything to do with human activities, according to Dr. J. Gordon Arbuckle Jr., a sociology professor at Iowa State University.“Farmers in general are taking extreme weather more seriously,” said Arbuckle, who has interviewed and polled farmers in the Corn Belt region on the issue. “But most of them are more in line with there maybe being a human cause, but probably some natural cause to it.”That could be changing, at least slowly. A 2011 poll of Iowa farmers found only 11 percent of respondents agreed with the statement that climate change is occurring and “is caused mostly by human activities.” Two years later, the poll asked the same question and found that 16 percent of respondents agreed. Many farmers are also warming up to agricultural practices like cover crops and reduced tillage that not only make their farms more resilient to extreme weather, but can also reduce greenhouse gases. In Iowa, farmer participation in conservation and pollution reduction programs aimed at encouraging these types of practices is on the rise. The number of cover crops planted in Iowa increased 35 percent last year, for example. Progress can also be seen through initiatives like the Risky Business Project, which has seen global agribusiness firms like Cargill partner to support research into the relationship between climate change and agribusiness in the Midwest. “It’s coming along but, perhaps like it is in all sectors of society, it could happen a lot faster and probably needs to happen a lot faster,” Arbuckle said.Some national farm groups have been slow to address the issue.American Farm Bureau, the nation’s largest farm organization, has expressed skepticism about the impact U.S. action on climate change would have on global temperature or extreme weather events and is opposed to any efforts to regulate the industry’s emissions. The Farm Bureau did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment for this story.Other organizations are taking a more proactive approach. The National Farmers Union, a group representing some 200,000 farms throughout the country, maintains a Climate Leaders hub. It shares resources on climate change with its member farmers and encourages farmers to consider adopting more “climate-smart” practices. Thomas Driscoll, the union’s director of conservation policy and education, admits that many farmers remain hesitant to discuss climate change openly.But shifting the conversation away from that particular term, he believes, can still have a similar outcome of encouraging some of those practices without alienating farmers who aren’t on board with the climate science. “We find more and more that focusing on trends in weather and talking about disaster-resilient farming is more effective than talking about ‘climate change,’” Driscoll told HuffPost.But in the longer haul, Driscoll believes it’s important to name the problem exactly what it is. And there’s still some way to go on that front.“Where you can, you really need to get the full climate message across,” Driscoll said “and then we’ll be able to take a more holistic approach and work with the whole picture, rather than just treating the symptoms.”"

The man had been laid out on a wooden bed with a reed pillow beneath his head.Thirteen cannabis plants, each up to almost three feet long, were placed diagonally across the man’s chest, with the roots oriented beneath his pelvis and the tops of the plants extending from just under his chin, up and alongside the left side of his face.

This multipurpose plant has been valued not only for its psychoactive properties, but also for its durable hemp fibers, which could be woven into cloth, as well as its nutritious, oil-rich seeds.However, no hemp textiles have been found in Turpan burials, and the seeds of the plants in the Jiayi burial are too small to serve as a practical food source, archaeologist Jiang notes.Meanwhile, the flowering heads of the Jiayi plants were covered with glandular trichomes, a sort of tiny plant “hair” that in cannabis secretes resin containing psychoactive cannabinoids such as THC.

Too often, Navratilova said, governing bodies like the International Olympic Committee and FIFA have failed to protect people marginalized by their events. Mega-events like the Olympics and World Cup have been plagued in recent years by human rights violations, including labor abuses in Qatar, forced evictions and police killings in Rio de Janeiro, and crackdowns on protesters, journalists, activists, and LGBT people in Russia.“The principles of sport that are set out in the Olympic charter require sports governing bodies to promote and defend human rights,” Navratilova said. “If a sporting event is displacing a community without compensation, the local actors may also be to blame. But it is responsibility of the sport governing body ... to do something about it. They are the responsible party.“If the construction of stadiums and mega-sporting events is subjecting workers to unsafe conditions ... it is again the responsibility of the sport governing body to do something about it,” she continued. “And if women are being systematically denied access to a sporting event or stadiums, it is again the responsibility of a governing body to do something about it.”Navratilova addressed more than 120 international sports, business, political, and human rights officials ― including representatives from the IOC, FIFA, and their major corporate sponsors ― gathered at the U.S. State Department to discuss ways to improve human rights conditions surrounding mega-sporting events.The conference, organized by the U.S., Switzerland, and the international think tank Institute for Human Rights and Business, stemmed from a yearlong collaboration that developed more than a dozen proposed reforms covering such issues as forced housing displacement, LGBT and gender equality, fair labor standards and workers’ rights.The forum, perhaps the most ambitious effort yet to take on the landscape of mega-sporting events, comes at a crucial time. The industry is plagued not only by rampant human rights abuses, but also by corruption scandals, economic largesse, and increasing skepticism that the events aren’t worth hosting. During the conference opening session, participants told how rights abuses have eroded belief in ― and begun to overshadow ― the positive ideals these sporting events are supposed to promote.“The legitimacy and, dare I say, the credibility of sport has spiraled negatively downward in recent years, due to corruption, deceit, broken promises, and the adverse impact of major events on host communities and their citizens,” said David Grevemberg, CEO of the Commonwealth Games. “We have a reached a tipping point with those we serve most dearly ― people. It is a point where we can either rebuild our relevance and resonance, or swiftly become irrelevant and obsolete.”“We’re a powerful force for good when we choose to be,” Grevemberg added.Mary Robinson, the former president of Ireland who oversaw the committee of 20 organizations that developed the initial reform proposals, said she hopes to release final versions on Dec. 10, International Human Rights Day.“Some of the solutions are already out there,” John Morrison, chief executive of the Institute for Human Rights and Business, told The Huffington Post after the opening session. “Around construction, land appropriation, how you treat workers, freedom of expression. I just don’t think the world of sport knows about those issues.”The hope, Morrison and Robinson said, is that sports governing bodies begin to work collectively to address problems. In the past, sporting organizations have barely collaborated, if at all, on human rights issues, so they have failed to learn from each other. Morrison was shocked to learn, for instance, that “very little” communication took place between FIFA and Rio 2016 organizers, even as they planned a World Cup and Olympics in the same country.The central question is whether the world’s major international sporting organizations are ready to embrace changes. The IOC recently bolstered human rights standards in its host city contracts, and FIFA has been urged to do the same. But both organizations have made a habit of shrugging off rights violations around their events, instead blaming on local organizers and governments.Anita DeFrantz, a member of the IOC’s executive board, said the organization is committed to working with this group, and expanding its human rights protections alongside other sporting organizations. (Notably, DeFrantz did not mention forced evictions, police brutality, or other issues prominent around Rio 2016, though she did note IOC-supported programs to assist women and children in Brazil.)“In recent months, we have opened a new dialogue with representatives of civil society groups to address concerns that have been raised around the games,” DeFrantz said. “We are actively exploring what changes can be made before, during, and after the games. ... We will take forward the core principles laid before this conference as part of this work.”The involvement of human rights, anti-corruption, and international labor groups that have criticized the current state of mega-sporting events may further bolster the process. With help from those groups, potential reforms or standards may be stronger and more focused than those FIFA and the IOC have implemented on their own. “There does seem to me to be very significant buy-in,” Robinson told HuffPost. “There is, I think, a real will to provide that learning across sports, that determination that human rights and labor standards must be absolutely integrated” into these events.Navratilova, too, said she believed the forum could lead to reforms that help sporting organizations promote human rights, instead of violate them. “Because these events are awarded seven or 10 years ahead of time, imagine if that period was used to meaningfully improve human rights and the lives of the local population,”Navratilova said. “But too often mega-sporting events, with their long lead times, have brought high human costs for workers, for journalists, for children, for all of the local population.”“These human rights standards should not only address those things that we hope to avoid or mitigate,” she said, “but also encourage the many ways a mega-sporting event can positively impact the country and its communities.”"

During the conference opening session, participants told how rights abuses have eroded belief in ― and begun to overshadow ― the positive ideals these sporting events are supposed to promote.“The legitimacy and, dare I say, the credibility of sport has spiraled negatively downward in recent years, due to corruption, deceit, broken promises, and the adverse impact of major events on host communities and their citizens,” said David Grevemberg, CEO of the Commonwealth Games. “We have a reached a tipping point with those we serve most dearly ― people. It is a point where we can either rebuild our relevance and resonance, or swiftly become irrelevant and obsolete.”“We’re a powerful force for good when we choose to be,” Grevemberg added.Mary Robinson, the former president of Ireland who oversaw the committee of 20 organizations that developed the initial reform proposals, said she hopes to release final versions on Dec. 10, International Human Rights Day.“Some of the solutions are already out there,” John Morrison, chief executive of the Institute for Human Rights and Business, told The Huffington Post after the opening session. “Around construction, land appropriation, how you treat workers, freedom of expression. I just don’t think the world of sport knows about those issues.”The hope, Morrison and Robinson said, is that sports governing bodies begin to work collectively to address problems. In the past, sporting organizations have barely collaborated, if at all, on human rights issues, so they have failed to learn from each other. Morrison was shocked to learn, for instance, that “very little” communication took place between FIFA and Rio 2016 organizers, even as they planned a World Cup and Olympics in the same country.The central question is whether the world’s major international sporting organizations are ready to embrace changes. The IOC recently bolstered human rights standards in its host city contracts, and FIFA has been urged to do the same. But both organizations have made a habit of shrugging off rights violations around their events, instead blaming on local organizers and governments.Anita DeFrantz, a member of the IOC’s executive board, said the organization is committed to working with this group, and expanding its human rights protections alongside other sporting organizations. (Notably, DeFrantz did not mention forced evictions, police brutality, or other issues prominent around Rio 2016, though she did note IOC-supported programs to assist women and children in Brazil.)“In recent months, we have opened a new dialogue with representatives of civil society groups to address concerns that have been raised around the games,” DeFrantz said. “We are actively exploring what changes can be made before, during, and after the games. ... We will take forward the core principles laid before this conference as part of this work.”The involvement of human rights, anti-corruption, and international labor groups that have criticized the current state of mega-sporting events may further bolster the process. With help from those groups, potential reforms or standards may be stronger and more focused than those FIFA and the IOC have implemented on their own. “There does seem to me to be very significant buy-in,” Robinson told HuffPost. “There is, I think, a real will to provide that learning across sports, that determination that human rights and labor standards must be absolutely integrated” into these events.Navratilova, too, said she believed the forum could lead to reforms that help sporting organizations promote human rights, instead of violate them. “Because these events are awarded seven or 10 years ahead of time, imagine if that period was used to meaningfully improve human rights and the lives of the local population,”Navratilova said. “But too often mega-sporting events, with their long lead times, have brought high human costs for workers, for journalists, for children, for all of the local population.”“These human rights standards should not only address those things that we hope to avoid or mitigate,” she said, “but also encourage the many ways a mega-sporting event can positively impact the country and its communities.”"

But ... it could have been much worse.”The storm, with an eye about 30 miles (48 km) across, weakened after moving back into the open sea and was downgraded to a Category 2 hurricane, its maximum sustained winds diminished to 110 miles per hour (175 kph).The Royal Gazette newspaper said the storm sheared rooftops from buildings, uprooted trees, flooded homes and downed power lines as it slammed into Bermuda, a major tourist destination and affluent insurance industry hub about 640 miles (1,030 km) off the coast of North Carolina.Passage of the hurricane’s eye provided a lull for about an hour, during which the skies cleared, the rain and winds ceased and some islanders emerged from boarded-up homes to stroll outside briefly. One person was even seen riding a bicycle through the streets, strewn with debris and vegetation.“At this point, there is no indication of any loss of life or serious injuries, Dunkley said. He said property damage was widespread, “but it’s not significant where it’s going to take weeks and months” to recover.The Bermuda Electric Light Company (BELCO) said that nearly 26,000 customers were without power, roughly 85 percent of its customers, and that many power lines and utility poles had been knocked down.By early evening, winds had diminished to below tropical storm-strength and repair crews were able to venture safely into the streets to begin assessing damage as the storm moved farther from shore, Dunkley said. The international airport there was expected to reopen on Friday, he said.Bermuda is often in the paths of Atlantic storms and has extensive experience in handling them. The last hurricane to score a direct hit on the island territory was Gonzalo, which made landfall as a Category 2 storm days after the island was hit by Tropical Storm Fay.Hurricane Fabian, which pummeled the island in 2003 and caused $300 million in damage, was a Category 3 storm.Nicole shot through Bermuda just a week after Hurricane Matthew tore a path of destruction through impoverished Haiti en route to the United States, where it triggered severe flooding. Matthew, which briefly rose to the maximum Category 5 intensity, killed more than 1,000 people in Haiti, and left more than 30 dead in Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas.(Reporting by Sandra Maler in Washington; Writing and additional reporting by Steve Gorman in Los Angeles; Editing by Peter Cooney and Sandra Maler)"

Zeid first criticized the Republican nominee, among other right-wing politicians, last month in a statement condemning “populists, demagogues and political fantasists.”That prompted a rebuke from Russia, a powerful U.N. player with a permanent position on the Security Council. The Russian representative to the U.N. called for Zeid to take back his comments about Trump and similar politicians in Europe, all of whom deny ties to Russia while praising its leader.Ban, who has served two terms as secretary-general, will step down at the end of the year. The former South Korean foreign minister has presided over the U.N. during a tumultuous decade that saw a global recession, multiple uprisings and refugee crises in the Middle East and Africa.During his tenure, Ban became known as a powerful advocate for more international action to fight poverty and climate change. But he also struggled to overcome a perception that he was a weak and aloof leader.The U.N. General Assembly voted Thursday to approve former Portuguese Prime Minister António Guterres as his successor. Ban and others had urged the organization, ultimately without success, to select a woman to be secretary-general – the first in the U.N.’s 70-year history.Ending the war in Syria, which has claimed about half a million lives and forced millions more out of their homes, will be a top priority for Guterres, who most recently served as the U.N. high commissioner for refugees.Ban said Friday that no country alone could solve the problems posed by mass global migration. While he did not directly address Syria’s war, he said that nations need to step up their efforts to aid in the refugee crisis, which is majorly driven by the situation in Syria.But the U.N.’s credibility in that country has plummeted because of controversies over the international organization’s distribution of aid. Critics say that U.N. agencies and other humanitarian groups have allowed the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad to direct most outside help to regions under his control, leaving some of the neediest civilians in rebel-controlled areas without food and medicine. Businessmen close to Assad have won tens of millions of dollars in U.N. contracts, the Guardian revealed recently, and The New York Times found earlier this year that the U.N.’s World Health Organization had hired the wife of a top Assad official.U.N. officials point out that they can only work with contractors approved by Assad’s government and note that they have directly criticized government obstructionism."

The island's drugs will face less regulatory hurdles entering the U.S. market after a change announced Oct. 14, 2016 by the Obama administration.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5800e8001a00006e145b97c6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Obama administration is continuing to chip away at trade sanctions against Cuba, announcing on Friday a blanket exemption for joint medical research and making it easier for Cuban drugs to reach U.S. patients.The announcement, which includes several other changes, means that Americans may now go to the island to carry out research with their Cuban peers for both academic and commercial purposes. The Treasury Department will allow Cuban pharmaceuticals to pass through the Federal Drug Administration’s approval process, and U.S. firms will be allowed to import and market them. Those who carry out medical work on the island under the new authorizations may now open bank accounts in Cuba for that purpose.The changes promise to boost Cuba’s health care system ― which is lauded throughout Latin America for its preventative care and held up as one of the socialist revolution’s greatest achievements by the Castro government. The island’s pharmaceutical industry has also made major advancements ― including developing the vaccine CimaVax, which impedes the growth of cancer cells, and Heberprot-P, which treats diabetic foot ulcers. Cuba has patented some 400 drugs, according to the NACLA Report on the Americas. The new policy marks another “step in the right direction,” said Ricardo Herrero, the executive director of #CubaNow, a group that supports engaging with the island.“Their biomedical industry is one that has a lot to offer to the American market,” Herrero said. “There is no justifiable reason for us to not open it up to their research, their medicine and their cures.”Some of the island’s drugs may face hurdles entering the U.S. market, however, because the Cuban government has disregarded international patents in order to make generics widely available and keep costs down. Christopher Sabatini, the executive director of Global Americans and a leading Cuba expert, said the changes could have a major impact, but thinks it’s unlikely U.S. companies would take advantage of the changes by investing in Cuba.“This clears up many of the regulatory hitches that remained from previous changes but also opens some new ones up as well,” Sabatini told The Huffington Post in an email. “The medical and pharma research is new and could potentially be important, though not as important as many in Cuba would like to believe… It’s unlikely that U.S. companies will pair up with Cubans to sell in Cuba for a number of reasons including the restrictions Cuba itself places on investments in pharma.” Herrero also acknowledged the potential for regulatory problems. Even so, he expects the U.S. and Cuban governments to resolve them as the two countries’ relationship deepens. “Part of the reason why Cuba has been able to ignore patents is because we’ve had an abnormal relationship for 50 years,” Herrero said. “The more we normalize the relationship, the more they’re going to have to adhere to international intellectual property standards.”The Treasury Department also authorized a series of other changes in the same announcement. U.S. visitors to Cuba may now bring back as much tobacco and alcohol as they like, and Americans may invest directly in some infrastructure projects. In addition to normalizing diplomatic relations with the Cold War foe this year, President Barack Obama has authorized a series of exemptions to the half-century old embargo since December of 2014. Americans may now travel to the island virtually unrestricted, though outright tourism remains nominally banned. Airbnb now operates on the island, offering a new financial lifeline to Cubans who have rooms or apartments available to rent ― a major change in a country where the average state salary is about $25. And in March, Obama became the first sitting U.S. president to visit the island since 1928. Obama indicated that he hoped Friday’s changes will make it all but impossible for a successor to reverse his Cuba policy.“This Directive takes a comprehensive and whole-of-government approach to promote engagement with the Cuban government and people, and make our opening to Cuba irreversible,” his statement said."

Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), John Conyers (D-Mich.), Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), and Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) pointed to informal Trump adviser Roger Stone’s insinuations that he had advance knowledge of the emails’ release as evidence that Stone ― or other figures in the campaign ― may have colluded in a Russian-backed breach.“For months, we have been asking the FBI to examine links between the Trump campaign and illegal Russian efforts to affect our election, including interviewing Trump advisor Roger Stone,” the congressmen said in a joint statement on Friday afternoon. “In light of this new evidence — and these exceptional circumstances — we call on the FBI to fully investigate and explain to the American people what steps it is taking to disrupt this ongoing criminal activity.”Cummings, Conyers, Engel and Thompson are the ranking members for the House committees on Oversight and Government Reform, Judiciary, Foreign Affairs and Homeland Security, respectively.Stone, who no longer has an official role in Trump’s campaign, is a longtime confidant of the reality TV star and remains in regular contact with him.And the “new evidence” the lawmakers reference are recent tweets in which Stone hinted that damaging information would soon emerge about Podesta.“Trust me, it will soon [be] Podesta’s time in the barrel,” Stone tweeted in August.On Wednesday, Stone admitted to CBS Miami that he had “back-channel communications” with Julian Assange, whose website WikiLeaks has been publishing the hacked emails.WikiLeaks has released thousands of Podesta’s emails over the past few days. They reveal some politically touchy material, including that Hillary Clinton had recently held less progressive views on trade and fiscal policy than she has espoused during her campaign. The Clinton campaign has blamed Russian-backed hacking efforts for the breach. The Obama administration has formally accused Russia of orchestrating a previous infiltration of Democratic National Committee emails as part of an effort to interfere in the upcoming U.S. election. The Russian government denied those allegations. But the IP address on malware in the DNC’s server is the same one used in other international cyber attacks attributed to Russia, according to a lengthy report on Vice News’ Motherboard site.The Trump campaign, meanwhile, has struggled to combat claims that it has ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin that could influence how the GOP nominee would govern as president.Trump himself has indicated that he would take a softer stance toward Russia’s involvement in Syria and Ukraine than either Clinton or President Barack Obama do. He has also praised Putin.Some of Trump’s advisers have their own history of ties to the Russian government or business interests, although the most significant of them, former campaign chief Paul Manafort, departed Trump’s team in August. Carter Page, a foreign policy adviser for Trump, took leave from the campaign when evidence of his relationship with Moscow came to light.There is speculation that Trump himself has investments in Russia or that Russians are significantly invested in his projects, but that is unverifiable since Trump refuses to release his tax returns. His oldest son, Donald Jr., has suggested that the family benefits from Russian largesse in one form or another. “Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets,” he said at a real estate conference in 2008. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

What began as this country’s first birth control clinic in Brownsville, Brooklyn, is now a cornerstone of the American health care system. Planned Parenthood has 650 clinics across all 50 states. It provides health care to millions of women and men. It affirms a woman’s fundamental right to comprehensive reproductive health care. And yet many GOP leaders, like vice presidential candidate Mike Pence, have made it their mission to defund Planned Parenthood. But they will have (and have had) to contend with the American public ― the majority of which supports continued federal funding for the organization ― as well as the many, many women who #StandWithPP. Because Planned Parenthood is an organization that radically transforms women’s lives.In honor of Planned Parenthood’s 100th anniversary, here’s a quick refresher on why it is so essential:1) 1 in 5 women have gone to a Planned Parenthood center.If Planned Parenthood’s impact was measured in terms of patient volume alone, it would be enormous. Some 2.5 million women and men visit Planned Parenthood affiliate health centers every year in this country, according to internal figures.If you broaden the scope in terms of geography and services, its impact grows. “Planned Parenthood provides sexual and reproductive health care, education, information, and outreach to nearly five million women, men, and adolescents worldwide in a single year,” Planned Parenthood says.2) Planned Parenthood affiliates provide 4,218,149 tests and treatments for STIs annually. And 635,342 breast exams and pap smears, according to its most recent annual report. Women go to Planned Parenthood for pregnancy tests and prenatal care. They go to treat urinary tract infections. For HPV vaccination. For colonoscopies. The list goes on and on.Then there’s birth control. In 2014 to 2015 alone, Planned Parenthood affiliates prevented 578,681 unintended pregnancies via contraceptive services, and supplied 931,589 emergency contraception kits. Studies have shown that when states slash funding for Planned Parenthood, women don’t go elsewhere for contraception; they were just less likely to get birth control and more likely to have babies. 3) Yes, it also provides abortions. Abortion makes up only about 3 percent of the overall services Planned Parenthood offers, but it’s an essential part. Between 2014 and 2015, Planned Parenthood affiliates provided 323,999 abortions ― a procedure that is safe and legal. 4) It helps women (and men) regardless of their income. The Guttmacher Institute estimates that in 2010, more than a third of women who got contraceptive care from safety-net health centers in this country ― meaning women who tend to be uninsured or who rely on Medicaid ― received their services from a Planned Parenthood site. The organization will not turn women away because of income. It will even help get women enrolled insurance coverage, by walking them through the plans offered under the Affordable Care Act, sitting down with them to sign up for Medicaid for the first time, or screening them to see if they qualify for other forms of funding or a sliding pay scale.5) It respects women’s autonomy. Lauding an organization for simply respecting women’s agency is absurd, and yet here we are. In 2016, we have a predatory misogynist running for president with a VP who has fought against abortion rights for years, and every day, in states across the country, women’s health care rights are being slowly chipped away. So yes, it is remarkable that Planned Parenthood has never wavered in its mission to empower patients to make informed, independent decisions about their own bodies. It is why the women who have turned to Planned Parenthood at some point in their lives tend to feel such devotion to it.As an anonymous 24-year-old woman once told The Huffington Post, “I owe my life and my sanity to them.”CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misstated the number of STI tests Planned Parenthood affiliates perform annually.

44,POLITICS,John McCain Is About To Learn The Consequence Of Snubbing Trump,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mccain-trump-reelection_us_5800e004e4b0162c043b63dd,Pulling his endorsement could give him a boost in the Senate race -- or come with a heavy price.,2016-10-14,"Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) is facing his toughest re-election of his career, thanks in part the unpopularity of Donald Trump at the top of the ticket. McCain recently withdrew his endorsement of Trump.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"COTTONWOOD, Ariz. ― At a Yavapai County early voting site this week, Mike Smith, a registered independent, said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) disavowing Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump would actually help the lawmaker win his sixth term to the U.S. Senate.“Because people are basically decent,” said Smith, a retired pharmacist who lives in nearby Sedona.At a Maricopa County voting site some 120 miles to the south, a registered Republican who supports Trump and spoke on the condition of anonymity was considerably less forgiving of McCain.“I may not vote for him,” she said. “I’m very disappointed in him.”McCain withdrew his support for the GOP nominee after The Washington Post published leaked audio of Trump boasting in 2005 about being able to grab women by their genitals without consent. This decision could wind up being a smart move. It could also be a noble career-ender ― it just depends how many of each type of voter will cast a ballot between now and Nov. 8.The leaked “Access Hollywood” audio and video was published last Friday. McCain was among two dozen Republican members of Congress who withdrew their support of Trump over the subsequent weekend.“There are no excuses for Donald Trump’s offensive and demeaning comments in the just released video,” McCain said in a statement.He followed up on that sentiment during Tuesday night’s debate with his challenger, Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick (D) from the Flagstaff area.“When Mr. Trump attacks women,” McCain said, “that is a point where I just have to part company. It’s not pleasant for me to renounce the nominee of my party.” According to the HuffPost Pollster average of surveys for the Arizona Senate race, McCain holds a safe 10-point lead ― however, the most recent polls are from mid-September. No numbers have been released recently enough to take into account McCain’s rejection of Trump.The danger for McCain is that Trump, despite his decline in the polls in the aftermath of the “Access Hollywood” video, nevertheless retains a solid grip on white, lesser-educated voters angry that economic and cultural changes in the country are leaving them behind ― in other words, a large chunk of the GOP base.Trump responded to McCain withdrawing his endorsement by publicly attacking the senator. During an appearance on Fox News, Trump said he had endorsed McCain in the days leading up to his August primary against Kelli Ward, an Arizona legislator who had frequently praised Trump.McCain wound up winning that primary by 13 points ― but may well have lost had Trump given his backing instead to Ward.“He was desperate to get my endorsement,” Trump said Tuesday on Bill O’Reilly’s program. “I gave him the endorsement because he needed it for the primary, and frankly, he ran against a very, very good woman. I feel very badly, I gave him the endorsement.”In a normal election, longtime Senate incumbents who are reasonably popular can expect to do several percentage points better ― at least ― than the presidential candidate at the top of their tickets. But that maxim is based on the idea that voters who choose to split their ticket will likely do so in favor of their local senator, not the other way around.Trump has not urged his supporters to withhold their votes from the Republican members of Congress who refuse to endorse him ― at least not yet.Even if he does, though, some voters believe that McCain will be able to ride it out, particularly since his break from the GOP nominee came not as a result of Trump insulting McCain for being captured after his plane was shot down over Vietnam, but over Trump’s views toward women.“I understand why he did it,” said Laurence Kaim, a 77-year-old retiree from Cottonwood who supports Trump. “I don’t agree with it, but I understand it.”Of course, one warning sign for McCain may be that voters who appeared most supportive of his stance against Trump also happen to be Democrats who are likely to vote for Kirkpatrick anyway.And that includes independent voter Smith, who was getting ready to walk into the Yavapai County elections office and cast his ballot for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and Kirkpatrick for Senate.“McCain’s been there past his sell date,” he said.

On Sunday evening, he was further thrust into the national spotlight when actress Laverne Cox gave him a shoutout at the Grammys.“Everyone, please Google Gavin Grimm,” Cox said before introducing Lady Gaga. “He’s going to the Supreme Court in March.”Grimm’s case could have major implications for transgender students throughout the country, as the justices will determine whether anti-discrimination laws that forbid sex discrimination in schools should be interpreted to allow Grimm to use the restroom that corresponds with his gender identity.In October, right before the Supreme Court decided to take up the case, Grimm spoke with The Huffington Post. He said that if he had a choice in the matter, he’d tell the justices to not bother with it.“I hope they say we don’t want to hear this case,” Grimm said. The teen is one of the biggest victors in the so-called “bathroom wars” ― a recent wave of legislation, lawsuits and public outcry over transgender access to public facilities, particularly at schools and universities in more conservatives parts of the country.Last April, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, in Richmond, Virginia, sided with Grimm in a first-of-its-kind ruling that told the Gloucester County School Board that federal civil rights law more or less requires it to allow Grimm to use the bathroom that corresponds with his gender identity.The ruling set an important precedent, in no small part because the 4th Circuit also covers North Carolina, where Gov. Pat McCrory (R) signed into law H.B. 2 ― a bill that excludes transgender individuals from public bathrooms. The law itself has sparked a flurry of litigation involving the state, its flagship university, the Department of Justice and private citizens ― plus backlash from corporations, the NCAA, and civil rights groups that have denounced it as transphobic.In a way, the Grimm case is a small slice of these larger controversies ― which together make up a complex national conversation where the rights of transgender students intermingle with issues of federal policymaking and concerns about privacy and public safety. “I’ll certainly be very glad and relieved,” Grimm said of his case, which could be over soon if the Supreme Court declines to review the school district’s appeal of the 4th Circuit’s ruling. “I’ll be able to take a nice big deep breath and feel like I have my life – to some extent – back. It’s felt very much like it’s been put on hold for this case.”Grimm’s ordeal began during his freshman year, when he formally came out to his parents as transgender. They took him to see a psychologist, who diagnosed him with gender dysphoria and noted in a treatment letter the kind of therapy he needed and that he ought to be dealt with as a male in all areas of his life. That, naturally, included bathroom use.Grimm has found the attention paid to his situation surprising. The 17-year-old boy considered the details of his situation to be “a bit of a private matter.” People don’t often discuss where and when they have to go, so why should the public eye follow which bathroom a random high school student uses in-between classes?Grimm’s school was receptive to this transition at the start of his sophomore year. It initially made accommodations for him to use the bathroom in the nurse’s office. But Grimm soon grew weary of this separate treatment and, with the principal’s blessing, he began using the same bathroom as all the other boys at the high school. By then, he had begun receiving hormone therapy.For several weeks and much like in every other public setting, like restaurants and shopping malls, Grimm’s use of the men’s room at the school went unnoticed and without incident. But some of the adults were alarmed by the arrangement and complained to the Gloucester County school board, which succumbed to the pressure and in a matter of months approved a policy effectively relegating Grimm to single-stall restrooms that were created just for him.“All I want to do is be a normal child and use the restroom in peace, and I have had no problems from students to do that ― only from adults,” he told the board before its vote. “No one has given me any problem, and I have never been happier exercising my right to be who I am.”Grimm eventually sued the school board with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union. That led to the battle that is now before the Supreme Court. His attorneys have already made their case and hope that the justices on Friday will decide the dispute is not worth their while.But if Grimm could tell the court anything about who he is, beyond abstract legal jargon, he would want them to know that, as an everyday student, he is really, really stressed.“I’d like them to know what kind of mental duress the situation has put me under,” Grimm said. “And how positive it would be for my mental health to go back to using the correct restroom.”The Supreme Court caused some of this pressure. Shortly before the start of his senior year in September, five members of the court agreed to temporarily put on hold his court victory at the 4th Circuit. Justice Stephen Breyer, who often votes with the court’s liberal bloc, wrote separately to explain he joined the court’s four conservatives “as a courtesy” and “to preserve the status quo” for Gloucester county’s coming school year.The high court only reviews a tiny fraction of the thousands of appeals it receives every year, and here there is a strong possibility that the justices may choose to not get involved. They may decide it’s too soon to review the legal issue at stake ― an administrative doctrine the U.S. Department of Education has applied aggressively in similar cases. They may want to wait for other courts to weigh in on similar litigation.Or they may simply feel that they need one extra member to decide the matter conclusively ― the Supreme Court has been short-staffed since the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, and the potential for a 4-to-4 split wouldn’t help anyone.If that’s the route the court takes, that would be a relief for Grimm, not only because he would get to finish his senior year using the mens restroom, but he would be free from the national spotlight.For a teen who describes himself as a “relatively private person,” the pressure and publicity from the case has been tough. Most teens spend their senior year planning for college and soaking in the final months of carefree days with friends, but Grimm is now the public face of a polarizing issue. He still faces cruelty from other students at school. Not everyone in his family has been supportive him. On top of all that, he has homework.If it weren’t for his school’s anti-trans policy, Grimm’s life might look like that of any other teenager. While he doesn’t get along with many of his peers ― some of them express outright contempt for him ― he has a small, tight-knit group of friends who accept him unabashedly. With them, his gender identity is a non-issue; when the subject does come up, his friends express frustration that so many others fail to accept him. “I do feel that a lot of my peers are ― since this gone as blown up as big as it has ― they’ve been a bit more standoffish and maybe a bit more unkind,” Grimm said of fellow students and people in his community. “I’m sure they have these preconceived notions of me. I think that I definitely understand where they’re coming from. I absolutely do. I wish less people would treat me poorly because of those notions.”But when he is not thinking about lofty issues surrounding how the world perceives him or the intolerance he faces, Grimm focuses on the day-to-day. Next year, he plans to go to community college, but doesn’t have many plans beyond that. And as far as end-of-year, over-the-top senior year events, like prom, Grimm would like to go, but he has his concerns.“A lot of it has to do with – will I have money at that point? Will I have anything saved up? Or will I have blown my money on some stupid impulse purchase?” Grimm said. Teenager stuff.This article has been updated to include references to new developments in Grimm’s case, and a mention by actress Laverne Cox at the Grammy Awards on Feb. 12, 2017."

47,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton Is Organizing Muslim Voters. They Could Decide The Election.,Omar Kasrawi and Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-muslim-outreach_us_5800fe72e4b0e8c198a7a27c,Muslims are fighting Donald Trump's rhetoric in the electoral arena.,2016-10-14,"Mohammed Gula, left, leads the Clinton campaign's Muslim outreach in Toledo, Ohio.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/580103fa1b0000e218ef71fa.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"TOLEDO, Ohio ― Farooq Mitha has racked up a lot of miles in his job as Muslim outreach director for Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. He’s met with Muslim communities in Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Ohio to convince them to vote for Clinton in November.Mitha’s job is unique: He is the first sustained Muslim outreach director employed by a major party’s general election campaign. In a year when Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has demonized Muslims and stoked Islamophobic fears of an internal threat, Clinton’s campaign is investing energy and resources into organizing Muslim voters to help her win key swing states.“Reaching out to Muslim-Americans is not a numbers-driven game for the campaign,” Mitha said. “Muslim-Americans have been part of this country for centuries and have a long history here, and have been contributors to the United States across many fields ― entrepreneurs, job creators, teachers, firemen, police officers. It’s a community that’s very important.”Muslims make up approximately 1 percent of the U.S. population, or about 3.3 million people. According to the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which is undertaking a large voter registration drive, there were 824,000 Muslims registered to vote in June 2016. In states like Florida, Michigan and Virginia, Muslims are a large enough group that they can sway a close election.The Clinton campaign also hopes that organizing in Muslim communities will help them in states like Ohio. In July, the campaign opened an office in Toledo, where Mohamed Gula leads organizing efforts for the Muslim community.“I’ve made it my personal objective to ensure that this election is not going to be about Muslims without Muslims. It’s no longer going to be without us, or about us without us,” Gula said. “That’s one of the main reasons I felt the need to really be a part of the campaign.”The outreach conducted by Gula, a native of Dayton, Ohio, whose parents immigrated from Libya, includes the traditional door-knocking, phone-banking and canvassing. It also includes more targeted efforts at mosques and Muslim community centers.Gula and the campaign hosted an iftar dinner during this year’s Ramadan. They registered voters during the holiday of Eid and held registration drives after Friday night prayers. As Gula explains, much of his work involves listening to members of the diverse Muslim community to understand their concerns.“Being able to be present, and really listen to what concerns the community has had, has been extremely important, I think, to anybody,” he said.Zara Rahim, the communications lead for Clinton’s Muslim outreach team, also emphasizes the importance of listening to build bonds and trust that can lead to a more politically engaged community.“This campaign understands that the community isn’t monolithic, and part of that is just identifying that and making sure that we’re talking to people about the issues they care about,” Rahim said. “A lot of that means listening sessions. It means figuring out... what issues are most important to them, and how do we apply that to our ground game.”In recent elections Muslims have voted overwhelmingly for Democrats. That hasn’t always been the case. In 2000, Muslims voted in large majorities for George W. Bush. His call for an end to racial profiling of Arab-Americans in a debate helped bring Muslims to his side. Bush heavily courted the Muslim vote in Florida, and their turnout helped tip the state and the election in his favor.But Muslim support for Republicans receded after Sept. 11, the ensuing wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the advent of controversial torture, spying and profiling programs. The rise of Islamophobic politicians in the Republican Party during the past decade has accelerated the trend of Muslims moving toward the Democrats.In 2008, Barack Obama hired Mazen Asbahi, a lawyer at the firm Schiff Hardin, as his Muslim outreach director. However, Asbahi stepped down after a few weeks when conservative news sites attacked him for serving on the board of the Dow Jones Islamic Index Fund with an imam who was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in a racketeering trial against individuals accused of sending money to Hamas.Unsurprisingly, the open Islamophobia of the Trump campaign is the biggest issue Clinton’s Muslim outreach team has heard about in their listening sessions.“The number one thing people are really saying to me right now is that they’re scared for the future of the community in this country,” Mitha said. “They’re scared for their kids to go to school. The rhetoric they hear in our political and civic space is at a level that they’ve never experienced before.”“What the Trump campaign has done is, it has created a platform for hate rhetoric,” Gula said. “It has given people the confidence to be able to speak out openly about how they feel about Muslims. And that’s why I say that it has actually gotten worse. I’ve had more hate rhetoric now than I did post-9/11.”Gula described incidents where he has encountered such hate. “I have direct encounters with Islamophobia on a weekly basis,” he said. “I’ve had individuals approach me at gas stations telling me ― well, cussing at me and telling me to go back home. I’ve had people cussing at me and telling me, saying that they’re supportive of Trump and going on and going forth. I’ve had individuals cuss the religion itself.”Hate crimes against Muslims jumped by 78 percent during Trump’s rise in 2015, according to a report from the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. There were 260 anti-Muslim hate crimes last year, the greatest number of any year since 2001.For Rahim, Trump’s proposal to ban Muslims from entering the United States inspired her to leave her job at a technology company and go to work for the Clinton campaign to organize Muslim voters.“Under the proposed ban that Donald Trump is calling for, the total, complete shutdown of Muslims entering the country, I wouldn’t be having this conversation,” Rahim said. “I wouldn’t be in this job, I wouldn’t be talking to the people that I talk to every day about why this campaign is so important. My parents came to this country in 1980 believing in the American dream.”At the second presidential debate, Gorbah Hamed, an undecided Muslim voter, asked Trump about Islamophobia and what he would do to help combat its rise. Trump initially responded by calling Islamophobia “a shame,” but quickly shifted the blame to Muslims.“There is a problem,” he said. “We have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on. When they see hatred going on, they have to report it.”Trump wasn’t talking about reporting instances of Islamophobia. Rather, he was arguing, the problem is that Muslims don’t monitor each other for criminal or extremist behavior.“If they don’t do that, it’s a very difficult situation for our country,” he said.The Huffington Post attempted multiple times to contact the Trump campaign about its outreach to Muslims, but did not receive a response.Of course, fear of Trump and his supporters isn’t the only issue animating Muslim voters this year. The country’s immigration system, for example, is in need of revision, since it can keep some recent immigrants or asylum seekers from traveling for years. And like all Americans, Muslim voters are concerned about jobs, health care and college affordability.In the Democratic primary, Muslims strongly supported Clinton’s principal challenger, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Their support likely helped propel Sanders to an upset victory over Clinton in Michigan. Clinton’s campaign has since deployed Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), a former Sanders backer who is one of two Muslims in Congress.“Reaching out and being engaged from the get-go was really important, and we’ve been building on that,” Mitha said.The campaign’s outreach is not only focused on getting Muslims to help organize other Muslims. It’s also about Muslims engaging in the election like every other group ― calling voters and knocking on doors. Gula hopes that this simple engagement, this act of being present, will empower Muslim voters and help them build connections with communities that may be distrustful of them.“I want... an everyday Joe to be able to hear ‘Hello, this is Mohamed, how are you doing today?’” Gula said. “I think that’s more powerful than anything. I think that’s more powerful than Mohamed calling Mohamed ... For [Muslims] to be able to hear some of what people have to say is key.”Oumeima Djema, a Toledo high school sophomore, is one of Gula’s volunteers doing just this.“I think, Muslim or not, it’s very important to, like, know what’s going on in the community and what’s going on in the country. Because if you take away that Muslim title, I’m still a member of the community and I’m a citizen of the United States,” she said. “I want someone good to lead our country and bring it to greatness.”Sharaf Mowjood contributed reporting.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.The Huffington Post is documenting the rising wave of anti-Muslim bigotry and violence in America.

He’s met with Muslim communities in Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Ohio to convince them to vote for Clinton in November.Mitha’s job is unique: He is the first sustained Muslim outreach director employed by a major party’s general election campaign. In a year when Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has demonized Muslims and stoked Islamophobic fears of an internal threat, Clinton’s campaign is investing energy and resources into organizing Muslim voters to help her win key swing states.“Reaching out to Muslim-Americans is not a numbers-driven game for the campaign,” Mitha said. “Muslim-Americans have been part of this country for centuries and have a long history here, and have been contributors to the United States across many fields ― entrepreneurs, job creators, teachers, firemen, police officers. It’s a community that’s very important.”Muslims make up approximately 1 percent of the U.S. population, or about 3.3 million people. According to the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which is undertaking a large voter registration drive, there were 824,000 Muslims registered to vote in June 2016. In states like Florida, Michigan and Virginia, Muslims are a large enough group that they can sway a close election.The Clinton campaign also hopes that organizing in Muslim communities will help them in states like Ohio. In July, the campaign opened an office in Toledo, where Mohamed Gula leads organizing efforts for the Muslim community.“I’ve made it my personal objective to ensure that this election is not going to be about Muslims without Muslims. It’s no longer going to be without us, or about us without us,” Gula said. “That’s one of the main reasons I felt the need to really be a part of the campaign.”The outreach conducted by Gula, a native of Dayton, Ohio, whose parents immigrated from Libya, includes the traditional door-knocking, phone-banking and canvassing. It also includes more targeted efforts at mosques and Muslim community centers.Gula and the campaign hosted an iftar dinner during this year’s Ramadan. They registered voters during the holiday of Eid and held registration drives after Friday night prayers. As Gula explains, much of his work involves listening to members of the diverse Muslim community to understand their concerns.“Being able to be present, and really listen to what concerns the community has had, has been extremely important, I think, to anybody,” he said.Zara Rahim, the communications lead for Clinton’s Muslim outreach team, also emphasizes the importance of listening to build bonds and trust that can lead to a more politically engaged community.“This campaign understands that the community isn’t monolithic, and part of that is just identifying that and making sure that we’re talking to people about the issues they care about,” Rahim said. “A lot of that means listening sessions. It means figuring out... what issues are most important to them, and how do we apply that to our ground game.”In recent elections Muslims have voted overwhelmingly for Democrats. That hasn’t always been the case. In 2000, Muslims voted in large majorities for George W. Bush. His call for an end to racial profiling of Arab-Americans in a debate helped bring Muslims to his side. Bush heavily courted the Muslim vote in Florida, and their turnout helped tip the state and the election in his favor.But Muslim support for Republicans receded after Sept. 11, the ensuing wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the advent of controversial torture, spying and profiling programs. The rise of Islamophobic politicians in the Republican Party during the past decade has accelerated the trend of Muslims moving toward the Democrats.In 2008, Barack Obama hired Mazen Asbahi, a lawyer at the firm Schiff Hardin, as his Muslim outreach director. However, Asbahi stepped down after a few weeks when conservative news sites attacked him for serving on the board of the Dow Jones Islamic Index Fund with an imam who was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in a racketeering trial against individuals accused of sending money to Hamas.Unsurprisingly, the open Islamophobia of the Trump campaign is the biggest issue Clinton’s Muslim outreach team has heard about in their listening sessions.“The number one thing people are really saying to me right now is that they’re scared for the future of the community in this country,” Mitha said. “They’re scared for their kids to go to school. The rhetoric they hear in our political and civic space is at a level that they’ve never experienced before.”“What the Trump campaign has done is, it has created a platform for hate rhetoric,” Gula said. “It has given people the confidence to be able to speak out openly about how they feel about Muslims. And that’s why I say that it has actually gotten worse. I’ve had more hate rhetoric now than I did post-9/11.”Gula described incidents where he has encountered such hate. “I have direct encounters with Islamophobia on a weekly basis,” he said. “I’ve had individuals approach me at gas stations telling me ― well, cussing at me and telling me to go back home. I’ve had people cussing at me and telling me, saying that they’re supportive of Trump and going on and going forth. I’ve had individuals cuss the religion itself.”Hate crimes against Muslims jumped by 78 percent during Trump’s rise in 2015, according to a report from the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. There were 260 anti-Muslim hate crimes last year, the greatest number of any year since 2001.For Rahim, Trump’s proposal to ban Muslims from entering the United States inspired her to leave her job at a technology company and go to work for the Clinton campaign to organize Muslim voters.“Under the proposed ban that Donald Trump is calling for, the total, complete shutdown of Muslims entering the country, I wouldn’t be having this conversation,” Rahim said. “I wouldn’t be in this job, I wouldn’t be talking to the people that I talk to every day about why this campaign is so important. My parents came to this country in 1980 believing in the American dream.”At the second presidential debate, Gorbah Hamed, an undecided Muslim voter, asked Trump about Islamophobia and what he would do to help combat its rise. Trump initially responded by calling Islamophobia “a shame,” but quickly shifted the blame to Muslims.“There is a problem,” he said. “We have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on. When they see hatred going on, they have to report it.”Trump wasn’t talking about reporting instances of Islamophobia. Rather, he was arguing, the problem is that Muslims don’t monitor each other for criminal or extremist behavior.“If they don’t do that, it’s a very difficult situation for our country,” he said.The Huffington Post attempted multiple times to contact the Trump campaign about its outreach to Muslims, but did not receive a response.Of course, fear of Trump and his supporters isn’t the only issue animating Muslim voters this year. The country’s immigration system, for example, is in need of revision, since it can keep some recent immigrants or asylum seekers from traveling for years. And like all Americans, Muslim voters are concerned about jobs, health care and college affordability.In the Democratic primary, Muslims strongly supported Clinton’s principal challenger, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Their support likely helped propel Sanders to an upset victory over Clinton in Michigan. Clinton’s campaign has since deployed Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), a former Sanders backer who is one of two Muslims in Congress.“Reaching out and being engaged from the get-go was really important, and we’ve been building on that,” Mitha said.The campaign’s outreach is not only focused on getting Muslims to help organize other Muslims. It’s also about Muslims engaging in the election like every other group ― calling voters and knocking on doors. Gula hopes that this simple engagement, this act of being present, will empower Muslim voters and help them build connections with communities that may be distrustful of them.“I want... an everyday Joe to be able to hear ‘Hello, this is Mohamed, how are you doing today?’” Gula said. “I think that’s more powerful than anything. I think that’s more powerful than Mohamed calling Mohamed ... For [Muslims] to be able to hear some of what people have to say is key.”Oumeima Djema, a Toledo high school sophomore, is one of Gula’s volunteers doing just this.“I think, Muslim or not, it’s very important to, like, know what’s going on in the community and what’s going on in the country. Because if you take away that Muslim title, I’m still a member of the community and I’m a citizen of the United States,” she said. “I want someone good to lead our country and bring it to greatness.”Sharaf Mowjood contributed reporting.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.The Huffington Post is documenting the rising wave of anti-Muslim bigotry and violence in America.

Brian Sandoval (R), who called a special session to get the vote done. He’s expected to sign the bill on Monday.Sandoval has said the stadium ― which is meant to entice the NFL’s Oakland Raiders to move to Las Vegas ― will usher in a “new era for tourism” for the city.There is no economic evidence, however, that NFL stadiums have such effects on local tourism, according to economists who have studied the issue. The claims Sandoval and others made about tourism “have no basis in reality,” Stanford economist Roger Noll told The Huffington Post this week.Noll testified in the Nevada state Senate that the Las Vegas stadium deal was “the worst I’ve ever seen.”The new stadium is backed by billionaire casino mogul and Republican megadonor Sheldon Adelson, who has pledged $650 million for the project ― but only on the condition that the state approve the subsidy. Adelson’s Las Vegas Sands Corp. would operate the stadium.Progressive and libertarian grassroots groups pushed back against the stadium, arguing that Nevada could soon face a $400 million budget shortfall and that education and mental health programs’ needs should be addressed instead.Raiders owner Mark Davis will also contribute $500 million toward the new stadium, which has a total projected price tag of $1.9 billion.The NFL has not yet approved the Raiders’ relocation to Las Vegas. NFL owners are set to discuss the issue at upcoming league-wide meetings."

Richard Burr (R-N.C.), Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), Rep. Joe Heck (R-Nev.) and Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) for their record on women’s health issues. All four targets of Planned Parenthood Votes and Planned Parenthood Action Fund’s campaign face strong challenges from Democrats. “Each one of these Republican Senate candidates has voted to defund Planned Parenthood and staked out positions that threaten millions of women across this country,” Deirdre Schifeling, the executive director of Planned Parenthood Votes, said in a press release. “Not only is this agenda dangerous, but it is incredibly unpopular.” Republicans have routinely politicized Planned Parenthood and its federal funding, especially after an anti-abortion organization last year released edited videos purporting to show Planned Parenthood representatives selling fetal parts. GOP lawmakers launched a series of investigations that ultimately turned up no evidence of wrongdoing ― except by the anti-abortion group.One of the new ads targets Heck’s repeated votes to defund Planned Parenthood, accusing him of “putting women’s lives at risk” and calling him “a dangerous politician.” It will run on TV in both English and Spanish.Digital ads focus on the Republican senators’ efforts to restrict abortion and birth control access, and their opposition to equal pay for women.The ads are part of Planned Parenthood Votes and Planned Parenthood Action Fund’s $30 million political campaign this year, which it says is the largest in its history. The group has launched a website informing voters about candidates’ records on abortion access and reproductive rights, and has staff and volunteers in the battleground states of North Carolina, New Hampshire, Nevada, Ohio and Pennsylvania.HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

Emma Allred, a cancer survivor who dreamed of helping the homeless, chose to use her wish from the Make-A-Wish Foundation to hold a food drive.The 13-year-old’s event, which was held earlier this month, attracted hundreds of people. The incredible turnout is a testament to Emma’s giving spirit. “Of all the things, despite her siblings trying to get her to do other things, she chose to help the homeless,” Emma’s mother, Nina Allred, told local news outlet KMVT.Crowds showed up to the drive at a park in the city of Twin Falls and donated over 13,000 pounds of goods for food pantries, Inside Edition reported. Local organizations got in on the action as well, with the fire department and a grocery store, among other groups, contributing to the drive.Participants enjoyed some fun at the event, like face painting, cotton candy and a barbecue. Emma, who’s currently in remission, was shocked by the enormous support she received from her community. “She was overwhelmed but very appreciative of the community-wide support,”Julie Thomas, the Eastern Idaho regional manager for the state’s Make-A-Wish Foundation, told The Huffington Post. “She is extremely shy and humble; she kept wondering why everyone wanted their photo taken with her.”Thomas says that spreading kindness is simply part of who Emma is. “She just wants to help others!” Thomas explained. “She said there are so many other less fortunate people that she wants to just help them out in any way she can!”"

I was calling the police department, I was calling the sheriff’s department, and no one was answering, so I was really worried.”So he came up with a brilliant ― and delicious ― solution. He ordered a pizza.Eric Olsen, a Nebraska resident, called Papa John’s and asked to have a pepperoni pizza delivered to his grandmother’s residence, reports WFTV. He also left specific instructions for the deliveryman, Lance Tyler, to call him when Claire answered the door.When Tyler first came to her door, Claire Olsen was confused. “He knocked on the door and said, ‘Delivery.’ I said, ‘I didn’t order anything.’ He says, ‘Your grandson did,’” Claire Olsen told WFTV.After she opened the door, Tyler used his cell phone to call Eric Olsen in Nebraska.

In fact, you’re in good company: More Americans appear to be researching the process than ever before, at least according to Google Trends data.CNN reports that in the last week, the search term “write in” has skyrocketed to its highest level since at least 2004, the earliest year for which Google has data:While it would be easy to dismiss the trend as a potential anomaly and not necessarily politically related, there are several reasons why that’s probably not the case.First, the term itself follows a regular pattern, one that spikes every September and October at the height of election season. (This year, thanks to an election featuring the least-liked presidential candidates in history, it makes sense that more voters than ever would consider writing in someone else).Second, and perhaps most interesting, two states in particular have been asking Google about “write in” more than others: Vermont, home to Bernie Sanders, the former presidential candidate who gave Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton a run for her money in the primary; and Utah, where a poll released Wednesday shows independent presidential candidate Evan McMullin might have a shot at winning the state.So how does one successfully write in a candidate and make it count? It’s entirely dependent on the state where you vote. (Here’s a state-by-state explainer, courtesy of the National Association of Secretaries of State).In South Carolina, for instance, presidential and vice presidential ballots are prevented by law from including a spot for voters to write in an alternate candidate. Other, non-presidential ballots do include the write-in spot, however.And while it’s your vote and you’re free to use it (or not use it) however you see fit, elections officials would really rather voters didn’t write in fake names. It may be intended as a joke, but it takes real time and money to sort through them all.“Almost every election, there’s people who, I guess, think it’s fun to throw their vote away, basically,” Linda Spence, the town clerk in Manchester, Vermont, told the Associated Press back in the presidential election of 2004. “And while it may be worth a few giggles while you’re behind the curtain, it’s actually costing you tax dollars.”According to BallotPedia, a majority of states (34) require candidates to notify the secretaries of state ahead of time in order to have write-in votes for them count. Nine states don’t permit write-in votes at all (Arkansas, Hawaii, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Carolina and South Dakota), and seven states permit voters to write in without any advance notice by the candidate.If you’re confused ― and who wouldn’t be ― well, there’s always Google.

57,POLITICS,Three Men Come Up With A Jaw-Dropping Plan For Donald Trump To Win Over Millennial Women,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-millennial-women_us_57fed40de4b0162c0439e4b1,They plan to dredge up scandals from the '90s and blame a woman for the affairs of her husband. Really.,2016-10-13,Steve Bannon is one of the men running the Trump campaign's new offensive.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_0_104_4961_2798%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump’s campaign is set to launch an aggressive strategy to convince millennial women that he doesn’t want to “grab them by the pussy,” as he boasted about in a 2005 video ― by bringing up the sex scandals around former President Bill Clinton from the 1990s and laying some of the blame at the feet of his wife, Hillary Clinton.“We’re going to turn him into Bill Cosby. He’s a violent sexual predator who physically abuses women who he assaults. And she takes the lead on the intimidation of the victims,” Trump campaign CEO Steve Bannon told staff Tuesday, according to Bloomberg Businessweek.The offensive has already started. Just hours before Sunday night’s debate in St. Louis, Trump held a surprise press conference with several women who have accused Bill Clinton of inappropriate sexual behavior in the past. On Thursday, those women will appear on Sean Hannity’s Fox News show ― a program that few millennial women watch ― for a one-hour special. “With rape culture being what it is, these facts are going to shock millennial women,” Deputy Campaign Manager David Bossie told Bloomberg Businessweek. “There will not be a millennial woman who will want to vote for her when these facts come out.”The effort to attract millennial women will be led by three men: Bannon, Bossie and Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kusher. What the Trump men are doing is trying to blame Clinton for the indiscretions of her husband. They claim that she was essentially just as bad as he was, arguing that she helped him go after the victims and cover up what he did ― which includes an alleged rape. Many outlets (including The Huffington Post) have looked into the allegations by Bill Clinton’s accusers, but it’s important to remember that he is not running for president. Hillary Clinton is running for president. And there’s no evidence that Hillary Clinton knew what her husband was doing ― she has said Bill lied to her about what happened with Monica Lewinsky, for example ― and therefore willingly helped cover it up. Blaming a wife for her husband’s infidelities or even for defending him is not only sexist, but it risks further alienating women ― especially women who have gone through relationship turmoil themselves.“If Hillary Clinton can’t satisfy her husband what makes her think she can satisfy America?” Trump tweeted in April 2015.This strategy is also politically risky for the Trump campaign, threatening to further erode the low support he already has with women. When former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani (R) was considering a Senate run in 2000, he convened a focus group to test out prospective attacks. One of them was bringing up Bill Clinton’s infidelities. Voters reacted extremely negatively to them, making Hillary Clinton appear more likable and sympathetic. Bossie’s quote about “rape culture being what it is” also makes it clear that the Trump campaign isn’t serious about addressing the concerns that millennial women (and men) have about the issue of sexual assault, which has increasingly become a topic of debate on college campuses. Clinton has put forward a plan on how she would address the issue of sexual assault on college campuses. Trump has not released anything on the matter.And advocates who work with victims of sexual assault say that Trump and his 2005 sexual assault comments ― as well as his dismissal of them as just “locker room talk” ― hurt their efforts to combat the violence.“It normalizes a culture in which sexual assault goes excused,” Anna Voremberg, managing director of End Rape on Campus ― a group that works to prevent sexual assault on college campuses ― told The Huffington Post recently.On Wednesday evening, The New York Times published the accounts of two more women who said that Trump sexually assaulted them. Jessica Leeds said that when she sat next to Trump decades ago in the first-class section of a plane, he “grabbed her breasts and tried to put his hand up her skirt.” Rachel Crooks was 22 when she introduced herself to Trump in an elevator. She said she shook his hand, but then he began kissing her cheeks and then kissed her directly on the mouth.Trump surrogates made clear they don’t fully understand the problem, either, when they went on cable news Wednesday night. One supporter tried to cast doubt on Leeds’ story by saying there was no way something like that would have happened in a fancy place like first class. Another said that the women weren’t credible because they waited so long to come forward to tell their stories.On Tuesday, Trump held his first post-debate interview ― and the first interview since The Washington Post released the damning 2005 video ― with Fox News host Bill O’Reilly, a man who has faced allegations of sexual harassment and has implied that a woman who was raped and murdered was partially to blame for what happened to her because of what she was wearing and how much she had had to drink.“With rape culture being what it is these days,” in the crude words of Bossie, the public understanding of sexual assault is much more sophisticated than it once was. There’s more attention on the fact that sexual assault too often goes unreported, and it’s not uncommon for victims to wait years to tell their stories. “Locker room talk” and the “boys will be boys” mentality is no longer acceptable. Only one person in the race has been caught on tape bragging about sexually assaulting women and has been accused multiple times of actually sexually assaulting women ― and it isn’t Hillary Clinton. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Freitekh died in the crash and the instructor was badly injured.The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said on Wednesday that its initial investigation indicated the crash was “the result of an intentional act,” and the FBI joined the probe.Investigators came to believe that the crash was a suicide attempt by Freitekh after speaking with the instructor, said the two officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. There is no evidence Freitekh shouted religious statements before the crash and nothing else pointing to terrorism, the officials said. Freitekh had not been known to U.S. intelligence agencies.East Hartford Police Lieutenant Joshua Litwin said at a news conference on Wednesday that he did not know who was flying the plane at the time of the crash. The aircraft had two sets of controls, allowing either person to pilot the plane.Freitekh and the instructor, Arian Prevalla, argued and fought for control before the crash, the Hartford Courant reported on Wednesday, citing unidentified sources.East Hartford police and the FBI field office in Connecticut could not immediately be reached for comment on Thursday.The crash occurred across the street from the headquarters of aerospace manufacturer Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp. Investigators looked into whether the manufacturer was possibly targeted.Investigators, however, believe the plane was on the final approach to a small airport in East Hartford and had been cleared by air traffic controllers to land, one of the federal officials said.Freitekh became certified last year as a private pilot for single-engine planes, according to Federal Aviation Administration records.

Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (Wis.), have struggled with how to respond. Their choice: Stand with a man who faces multiple allegations of sexual assault, or unendorse their party’s nominee and risk upsetting his supporters. A couple of dozen Republican senators, representatives and governors were quick to unendorse Trump and call for him to leave the race, although a few have since changed their minds and have said they’re still supporting him.

Not only are women certain about their decision to have an abortion; many are more certain than people facing other health care decisions, like whether to have reconstructive knee surgery.In other words: Thanks for your concern, legislators, but when it comes to abortion, women are perfectly capable of making up their own minds.The new study ― conducted by researchers with the University of California, San Francisco’s Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health (ANSIRH), and published in the journal Contraception on Thursday ― included 500 women in Utah who’d gone to four different family planning facilities in the state. Before they met with a provider, the women answered something known as the “Decisional Conflict Scale” ― a test of a person’s certainty about a health care decision that is widely held to be the gold standard.Overall, the women demonstrated high levels of certainty about their decision to have an abortion.And using a standardized scale meant the researchers were able to directly compare their results to similar studies looking at other health care decisions. The researchers found, for example, that the women in their study were as certain ― or even more certain ― than men deciding what kind of treatment to choose after a prostate cancer diagnosis, or women determining whether to get a mastectomy after a breast cancer diagnosis. They were at least as certain as people deciding whether or not to have reconstructive knee surgery. “Our findings challenge the argument that women are particularly conflicted about whether or not to have an abortion and would universally benefit from laws that would require them to have additional counseling visits, to wait up to 72 hours before receiving care, or do ultrasounds,” Lauren J. Ralph, an epidemiologist from ANSIRH, told The Huffington Post.Yet according to The Guttmacher Institute, 35 states currently require that women undergo counseling before they can have an abortion, and 27 require they also wait for a period of time (generally, 24 hours) before they can have the actual procedure. Twenty-five states require that women be given information about the risks of abortion, some of which is flat-out wrong. “Every state requires that a patient consent before undergoing medical treatment and that the consent be ‘informed,’ ... however, abortion counseling requirements sometimes run afoul of these principles by requiring information that is irrelevant or misleading,” the organization says. The new study could make it harder for lawmakers to argue for waiting periods using women’s supposed “uncertainty” as a reason, but it is not without limitations. Young women and black women are underrepresented in the sample, while Mormon women were overrepresented. (The researchers point out that the Mormon women in the study were more likely to be uncertain about their decision than women who said they were not religious.)But the use of a standardized scale makes it harder to claim that women are, for some reason, less certain about abortion than they are about any other personal medical decisions the government trusts them to make.“We think our findings really challenge the assertion that abortion decision making is exceptional compared to other health care decisions,” said Ralph.Or as vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine said in the recent debate, perhaps on fundamental issues of morality, we should just trust women to make their own damn decisions.

If the name sounds familiar, that’s because he’s the ancestor of Dandy Mott, Finn Wittrock’s character in “Freak Show.” Like his relative before him, Dandy was also a deeply spoiled man; he simply fancied circus culture instead of art.Edward Mott purchased a lot’s worth of fine art at auction in Philadelphia and brought it to North Carolina along with his male lover. As a society man with severe social anxiety, he abandoned his wife and children for walls full of paintings in the remote South. He didn’t last long in his new home, though. During its construction, workers experienced accidents and odd events, and, upon its completion, a mysterious entity destroyed his beloved collection in the dead of night. Mott retaliated by locking all of his servants but one (his lover, of course) in the cellar, but Kathy Bates’ Butcher soon caught up with him. She ordered him impaled and burned; the only free servant was jailed for presumably killing his master, and the remaining servants died of starvation.According to a historian in the episode’s documentary segments, the Mott line survived through Edward’s children. That is, until 1952, when the last one died after a scandal in Florida. Dandy Mott, as we know, was drowned by the few “freak show” troupe members he hadn’t murdered.Lucky for Matt, Shelby and Flora, though, Edward Mott’s ghost carries a lot of guilt. He was quick to help them escape the house through a secret tunnel system, and, later, to make their “grrrand escape” from The Butcher’s angry mob. In the episode’s final moments, the little family is safe in a motel room and their horror story seems to have come to an end. And that makes us all the more ready to watch the big twist unfold next week in Episode 6.“American Horror Story: Roanoke” airs Wednesdays at 10 p.m. ET on FX."

The businessman’s campaign has been stoking racially charged bullying in schools, according to a Southern Poverty Law Center report released in April ― a trend that has been dubbed the “Trump effect.”Navigating issues of consent, assault and inappropriate language has only become more difficult since Friday, when The Washington Post published a leaked tape from 2005 in which Trump declares that his fame allows him to grab women “by the pussy.” “One or two students said ‘the tape’ was disgusting,” Corbett said. “Others have kind of said, ‘I agree’ and left it at that. ... None of them referred to it as sexual assault. I don’t know if they do or don’t quite have the language to talk about that.”It’s not an issue that Corbett, who teaches at Maritime Academy Charter Middle School in Philadelphia, expected to navigate when teaching the election.“In a typical election, the biggest issue you worried about tip-toeing around as a teacher would be something closer to abortion,” he said. “It’s something that gets students and parents riled up.”The revelations surrounding the leaked audio led 11th-grade educator Jarrett DeMent to condemn a candidate for the first time in his 11 years of teaching. He didn’t tell students in his civics and government classes who he planned to vote for, just for whom he would not. “I felt if I didn’t say something, my silence might be interpreted as accepting that type of behavior,” said DeMent, who teaches in Pennsylvania.When students discussed the tape in class on Tuesday, DeMent told them they weren’t allowed to repeat phrases from the footage. “Being that they are juniors in high school, I told them, ‘If you really want to know the exact quote, I’m sure you can find it online. But as far as what we’re talking about in class, we’re not going to exactly quote it,’” he said. English teacher Dylan Fenton works at a school that didn’t hold classes for the first half of this week. During the break, he prepared for a student-led discussion about the leaked audio. “I try not to lead my students to any types of conclusions,” he said. “Basically, if they’re saying something, I try and get them to tell me more. I will play devil’s advocate at times so they can respond and come up with more concrete opinions about what they’re saying.”He said he doesn’t plan to stop students from repeating some of Trump’s more unsavory language ― as long as it is “in the context of course.”Cindy Winston, who teaches at a charter high school in Arizona, also does not sugarcoat.Students openly discuss their political concerns in her class, even though she teaches science. “I’ll preface things like, ‘I’m going to tell you the same things I tell my own sons. You don’t use the word pussy. You just don’t. That is not common conversation,’” she said. “I’ve had conversations with my students about consent.”If there is a silver lining to an election cycle that has candidates discussing topics that teachers would typically condemn, it’s that kids are paying attention. Corbett said his students are more engaged with current events than usual.“Last year when topics would come up in class like the Chinese Exclusion Act or Trail Of Tears ― anything social justice-related ― or if race or discrimination came up, there would always be someone who would raise their hand and be like, ‘You got to talk about Donald Trump!’” he said. “It made a potentially easier real-world connection.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

That was our only interaction with him. And I thought: That’s how you want Bob Dylan, right? You don’t want him to be all cheesin’ and grinnin’ with you. You want him to be a little skeptical about the whole enterprise. So that was a real treat.”The Swedish Academy responsible for selecting Nobel Prize winners awarded Dylan the honor for “having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition.” In the congratulatory tweet from his @POTUS account, Obama also included a Spotify playlist of Dylan hits, embedded below:"

For his new album, Cohen will likely forgo touring to stay with his family and friends. Throughout his career, Cohen toured to earn money to support his two kids and their mother in addition to himself. “There was never an option of cutting it out,” he said. “Now it’s a habit. And there’s the element of time, which is powerful, with its incentive to finish up. Now I haven’t gotten near finishing up. I’ve finished up a few things. I don’t know how many other things I’ll be able to get to, because at this particular stage I experience deep fatigue.... There are times when I just have to lie down.” These days, he admitted, he “can’t play anymore, and my back goes fast. Spiritual things, baruch Hashem [thank God] have fallen into place, for which I am deeply grateful.”Among his “unfinished” materials are unpublished poems that need arranging and lyrics that need to be recorded. But Cohen is aware he might not get around to finishing them, and he’s OK with it. “I am a tidy kind of guy. I like to tie up the strings if I can. If I can’t, also, that’s OK.” he said. “But my natural thrust is to finish things that I’ve begun.”“I don’t think I’ll be able to finish those songs. Maybe, who knows?” he continued. “And maybe I’ll get a second wind, I don’t know. But I don’t dare attach myself to a spiritual strategy. I don’t dare do that. I’ve got some work to do. Take care of business. I am ready to die. I hope it’s not too uncomfortable. That’s about it for me.”Cohen has spoken about death in the past, notably in his music, which uses the topic as a recurring theme, but also in the touching letter he penned to former muse Marianne Ihlen, who died after a battle with leukemia this summer.In the letter, he wrote, “I am so close behind you, that if you stretch out your hand, I think you can reach mine.”To read more from Cohen’s interview, head over to The New Yorker. His album, “You Want It Darker,” will be released Oct. 21. "

Only the crowds weren’t clamoring for the hotel’s $18,000-a-night presidential suite or its $12 M&M’s. To the contrary: They were there to boycott the hotel and hurt Trump’s bottom line as much as possible.A picket line of about two hundred D.C. workers snaked in front of the hotel entrance, discouraging any would-be guests from getting a room for the night. The boycott stems from a labor dispute at Trump’s luxury hotel in Las Vegas, where he’s refused to bargain with a union that won an election to represent workers there last year. The union, Unite Here, is taking the rare step of organizing pickets at various Trump properties around the country, demanding that the Trump Organization recognize the Las Vegas workers’ union and start bargaining a first contract. Federal officials have accused the Trump Organization and its partners of violating workers’ rights on several occasions during the union campaign.The row in Vegas has not helped Trump’s image as a businessman with a history of stiffing employees and contractors. Trump has claimed he’d be a better candidate for union workers than Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. “This is a man who has made billions, allegedly, off the backs of his workers. And here he won’t recognize them,” said Venorica Tucker, a D.C. member of Unite Here who works a catering job at the U.S. House of Representatives. “It’s a pretty damn big deal.”Tucker came out to the picket line to show her support for the workers in Vegas, joined by postal employees, janitorial workers, bricklayers and other union workers from the D.C. area. Unite Here organized a separate boycott at Trump’s golf course in northern Virginia over the weekend.By calling a boycott, the union is essentially asking customers not to stay at the hotel. Plenty of customers will ignore that call, but others will heed it ― particularly other union workers and their families. (Of course, plenty of liberal hotel guests will be avoiding the Trump brand regardless these days.)Tefere Gebre, the vice president of the AFL-CIO labor federation, noted that unions aren’t eager to boycott companies that their members work for. But in the case of Trump’s Vegas hotel, Gebre said, management wasn’t fulfilling its obligations under the law to bargain with the mostly immigrant, lower-wage service workers.“We don’t do boycotts lightly,” Gebre said. “This is a man who writes books about being the greatest businessman in the world, but he’s afraid of 500 immigrant workers sitting across the table from him.” A union like Unite Here must apply for the AFL-CIO ― a federation of 55 unions ― to recognize a boycott that the union has issued. That process is underway in the case of Trump properties, according to Gebre. Trump and his partner in the Vegas hotel, casino magnate Phil Ruffin, spent a lot of money trying to beat back the union campaign. The hotel spent more than half a million dollars on consultants whose job is to convince workers to vote against the union in an election. Unite Here won the election anyway, by a count of 238 to 209.The general counsel for the National Labor Relations Board, a federal agency that referees labor disputes, has said that the hotel illegally retaliated against pro-union workers during the campaign. The hotel ended up settling some of those charges, agreeing to shell out $11,200 to two workers, but other charges are still pending.Even though the union won the election, Trump and his team have argued that the union tainted the results and asked that they be thrown out. An official with the labor board turned down that request and certified the election results, but the hotel appealed that decision to the full board in Washington. It hasn’t yet issued a ruling on the case.The hotel will likely stonewall the union until that case is resolved, leaving the employees without a contract. Most work in housekeeping or food service, and many of them are Latino and Filipino immigrants. According to Unite Here, the workers earn roughly $3 less per hour than other unionized workers on the Vegas Strip employed in comparable positions.The hotel hasn’t commented to The Huffington Post on the ongoing litigation.Debby Szeredy, vice president of the American Postal Workers Union, said Thursday that the Vegas dispute illustrated why Trump would be a bad president for working-class people. “They voted for a union,” Szeredy said. “They won, and he hasn’t done a thing to negotiate. We don’t trust him.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Not fashion label, as in Chanel or Gucci, but the itchy, annoying little tag hiding inside every single piece of clothing you’ve ever worn. That tag is the closest thing we’ve got to a legend, a guide to whatever it is we’re wearing. In many cases, it tells us what the item is made from and how to wash it. Unfortunately, labels leave out some pretty important information about our clothes and how they’re produced. In their understated way, clothing tags keep some of the garment industry’s most troubling secrets.You may not have a burning desire to know your turtleneck’s or your favorite jeans’ life story ― fair enough. But a number of label-obsessed clothing industry players want labels to be more informative and even empowering, to tell us more about how our clothes are made and help us discard them responsibly when we’re done with them. “The label is a place where we already to go access information, but we don’t get what we want,” Marianne Caroline Hughes, a United Kingdom-based sustainable fashion advocate and entrepreneur, told The Huffington Post. “It’s hugely underutilized as a place to access information and act upon information as well.”In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission enforces labeling requirements. That’s why the tag on your shirt tells you its country of origin, fiber content and the name of the manufacturer or dealer.Still, in many places, it’s optional to include the country of origin. For example, Hong Kong, home to one of the world’s largest textile industries, doesn’t require it. Same for the U.K., Sweden, Germany and several other European nations.Wherever they’re based, clothing companies certainly aren’t in the business of oversharing (if they even know all the details of their own supply chains, which they often don’t).Christina Dean, founder of the fashion waste reduction organization Redress, says that, ideally, every label would include information about an item’s environmental impact. And since garments aren’t necessarily made in just one place, labels should say where the garment was manufactured and where the fabric comes from.She’s not optimistic that brands would voluntarily offer this. Her more modest wish is for some kind of global standard, requiring every garment to state its country of origin. “It’s like a 101 of transparency,” she told HuffPost.Others believe clothing tags should acknowledge the people who toil unseen to make our clothes. The garment industry employs at least 60 million people worldwide ― from Bangladesh and Cambodia, to Europe and Los Angeles ― most of them women. In countries where poverty is rampant, companies involved in various stages of garment production have been known to employ young children and subject them to dangerous and unfair working conditions.After more than 1,100 garment workers died in the Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh in 2013, Sean McHugh and his colleagues at the Canadian Fair Trade Network set out to raise awareness about garment workers’ lives, using clothing tags to tell their stories.The group’s 2015 ad campaign, “The Label Doesn’t Tell The Whole Story,” featured sweaters and jackets with oversized tags crammed with information, based on the group’s research abroad. Each tag aimed to capture the experiences of a person who might have made the garment pictured. Here’s one of those stories:The label reads: 100% cotton. Made in Cambodia by Behnly, 9 years old. He gets up at 5:00 am every morning to make his way to the garment factory where he works. It will be dark when he arrives and dark when he leaves. He dresses lightly because the temperature in the room he works reaches 30 degrees [86 degrees Fahrenheit]. The dust in the room fills his nose and mouth. He will make less than a dollar, for a day spent slowly suffocating. A mask would cost the company ten cents.McHugh, the Canadian Fair Trade Network’s executive director, said the labels campaign was one of the group’s most successful ever. Facebook followers doubled, website traffic tripled and the campaign was covered in 15 countries and in eight languages. But the Network struggled to move from awareness to action. “The part that was lacking, the challenging bit, was the tangible next step for consumers to take,” McHugh told HuffPost.The nonprofit Fashion Revolution also sees clothing labels as a gateway to more accountability. Its signature campaign, “Who Made My Clothes,” asks people to photograph labels on their clothing and post them on social media, to pressure brands into sharing the human stories behind the items they make ― stories that would otherwise never be told. (Fashion Revolution supports HuffPost’s Reclaim series.) During the group’s annual awareness event in April, more than 1,200 brands, including Zara, American Apparel and Levi’s, responded to the hashtag #WhoMadeMyClothes, according to a Fashion Revolution spokeswoman. Some replies even included photos and names of actual garment workers. And if labels were to tell us the best way to get rid of our old clothes, what would that look like? Levi’s has been doing this since 2009. Its “Care Tag for Our Planet” label, in partnership with Goodwill, is now sewn into every Levi’s product. This tag tells you not only how to properly wash and dry items, but also suggests you donate them at the end of their life cycle, instead of throwing them out.“This is the first major step to begin to engage consumers in their environmental impact and what they can do reduce it,” Michael Kobori, a vice president of sustainability at Levi’s, said at the time of the Care Tag’s launch.As HuffPost has reported, Goodwill takes in millions of pounds of used clothing a year and makes a monumental effort to keep them out of landfills, even though every donated item doesn’t necessarily make it to needy people.

He dresses lightly because the temperature in the room he works reaches 30 degrees [86 degrees Fahrenheit]. The dust in the room fills his nose and mouth. He will make less than a dollar, for a day spent slowly suffocating. A mask would cost the company ten cents.McHugh, the Canadian Fair Trade Network’s executive director, said the labels campaign was one of the group’s most successful ever. Facebook followers doubled, website traffic tripled and the campaign was covered in 15 countries and in eight languages. But the Network struggled to move from awareness to action. “The part that was lacking, the challenging bit, was the tangible next step for consumers to take,” McHugh told HuffPost.The nonprofit Fashion Revolution also sees clothing labels as a gateway to more accountability. Its signature campaign, “Who Made My Clothes,” asks people to photograph labels on their clothing and post them on social media, to pressure brands into sharing the human stories behind the items they make ― stories that would otherwise never be told. (Fashion Revolution supports HuffPost’s Reclaim series.) During the group’s annual awareness event in April, more than 1,200 brands, including Zara, American Apparel and Levi’s, responded to the hashtag #WhoMadeMyClothes, according to a Fashion Revolution spokeswoman. Some replies even included photos and names of actual garment workers. And if labels were to tell us the best way to get rid of our old clothes, what would that look like? Levi’s has been doing this since 2009. Its “Care Tag for Our Planet” label, in partnership with Goodwill, is now sewn into every Levi’s product. This tag tells you not only how to properly wash and dry items, but also suggests you donate them at the end of their life cycle, instead of throwing them out.“This is the first major step to begin to engage consumers in their environmental impact and what they can do reduce it,” Michael Kobori, a vice president of sustainability at Levi’s, said at the time of the Care Tag’s launch.As HuffPost has reported, Goodwill takes in millions of pounds of used clothing a year and makes a monumental effort to keep them out of landfills, even though every donated item doesn’t necessarily make it to needy people.

He graduated from high school in North Carolina at just 16 and then went on to complete med school by his mid-20s. He became a partner at an HMO in California and, as he puts it, had a good job for life.“I was pretty happy,” Jeong told The Huffington Post.It wasn’t until he hit his 30s that Jeong decided to pursue acting and professional comedy, landing various small television roles and eventually a part in Judd Apatow’s 2007 movie “Knocked Up.” He then went on to appear in more Apatow projects and, after just a few years, got a starring role in the Todd Phillips movie “The Hangover.” Jeong hasn’t disappeared from the American limelight since.Despite his early successes in medicine, being an actor was Jeong’s real dream, hence why he refers to himself as a “late bloomer.”Jeong currently has a sitcom on ABC, “Dr. Ken,” that focuses on his life pre-bloom. The show recently returned for its second season after a retooling process by Jeong, who not only stars as the titular medical professional, but is also a creator, writer and co-executive producer of the series.“This year, it’s really, really personal,” Jeong said, later continuing during the conversation, “Last year I think we were very joke-driven, because I just wanted to prove that our show could be funny ... This year, it’s definitely not that at all. I definitely want it more emotionally grounded. I know what the show is now and the show is family.”Despite earning strong ratings for the show’s Friday night slot, the first season of “Dr. Ken” also caused an impassioned critical uproar. Its Metacritic score of 26 is one of the lowest ever. This is somewhat at odds with a previous show Jeong starred in, “Community,” which never found a large audience but was critically adored. The actor is incredibly proud of “Community” himself, calling it the best comedy in the last decade along with “30 Rock” and “Arrested Development.”“The last thing I want to do is another ‘Community’ because, let’s just do ‘Community’ then,” Jeong said with a laugh, adding that he’s still holding out hope a movie version of the show happens. “For me, I don’t want to be compared to anything else. ‘Dr. Ken’ is ... we’re not reinventing the wheel. We’re not the most inventive show. We’re not the best show. We’re my show. It’s my show. And I’m really happy with how things turned out.”For Jeong, “Dr. Ken,” has very much become an opportunity for personal growth as he tries to master the ins and outs of making every aspect of a comedic product. The show may depict an alternate timeline in which Jeong didn’t go into show business, but examining that route by running his own sitcom still takes the actor and comedian farther and farther away from the career he left behind. “I have nothing to gain out of this [show] like individually, in terms of people already know me from ‘The Hangover,’ people already know my comedy,” said Jeong. “I just want to make a good show. That’s what drives me right now, just making this a better show.” “Dr. Ken” airs Fridays at 8:30 ET on ABC."

President Peter Mutharika left Malawi on Sept. 15 to attend the United Nations General Assembly and has not been seen since. The meeting in New York City ended on Sept. 26, but Mutharika hasn’t returned home. Malawians took to social media to locate their president, using the humorous hashtag #BringBackMutharika.Malawians last saw Mutharika when he delivered a speech to the UN General Assembly, calling for international assistance to address hunger in his country. Then, according to Malawians on social media and commentators in the local press, he went AWOL. The UN referred Quartz to the Malawian mission at the UN, which hasn’t yet responded to an email inquiring about the president’s whereabouts. Opposition politicians and activists say the president’s prolonged stay has cost taxpayers 1.3 billion kwacha, $1.7 million, an amount the impoverished country cannot afford.The Malawian government would not release the president’s schedule, saying he was attending high-level meetings while in the US. Mutharika’s office released a statement on Oct. 11, promising that the president would return on Sunday, Oct. 16 at 1pm.Mutharika’s absence also began to fuel rumors that the 76-year-old president was receiving medical treatment in the US. One rumor said he was admitted to New York Presbyterian hospital. The hospital didn’t immediately respond to phone calls and emails.In response, Mutharika’s spokesman released a statement reminding citizens that the president “is enjoying very robust health” and anyone spreading dangerous rumors to the contrary would be “brought to book.”Malawians’ nervousness about their president’s health is not unfounded. In 2012, President Bingu wa Mutharika, the current president’s brother, died while receiving treatment in South Africa. Poorstate communication surrounding the then president’s illness and death led to widespread speculation and political uncertainty. This article originally appeared on Quartz Africa.

Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) wrote on Tuesday. He argued that any U.S. role in the violence, even an indirect one, makes the country liable for the more than 10,000 people killed there in the last 18 months.“The U.S. needs to cease immediately the aiding and abetting of the coalition,” Lieu wrote.In March 2015, President Barack Obama ordered the U.S. military to begin supporting the Saudi-led coalition, which seeks to restore the Saudi-friendly Yemeni government after a rebellion by Iran-backed militants known for their own brutal tactics. The U.S. has since been providing jet fuel, intelligence and fresh arms supplies to the coalition.Lieu and several other lawmakers have spent months condemning the U.S. role in the conflict, but little has changed. On Saturday, the Saudi-led campaign launched one of its deadliest attacks on Yemen yet with a series of airstrikes that killed at least 140 civilians and wounded hundreds more. Lieu decided to write again after a Reuters investigation showed that State Department lawyers knew the U.S. could be responsible for war crimes in Yemen. U.S. officials could be prosecuted for their role in the campaign under international and U.S. law, Lieu suggested.“Every U.S. assisted bomb that kills children, doctors, patients, newlyweds and funeral mourners has the potential to amplify hatred toward the U.S,” he added, describing such hatred as helpful for extremist recruiting.He implored the U.S. to halt all assistance to the Saudi coalition immediately until an investigation of the alleged crimes is complete. If Obama were to do that, he could effectively end the mass slaughter within hours. Lieu and other Democrats have notably refrained from directly blaming Obama for the violence, saving their harshest wards for a politically easier target: the Saudis.“Either the Saudi coalition is intentionally targeting civilians or they are not distinguishing between civilians and military targets,” Lieu wrote. “Both would be war crimes.”The Obama administration is currently conducting a review of its support for the Saudi-led coalition, prompted by Saturday’s attack.But that investigation does not mean the U.S. will immediately stop aiding the Saudis and their partners, including the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Morocco and others. And the Obama administration’s decision to directly hit the Houthi rebels for the first time on Thursday — in response to multiple attempted attacks on U.S. ships — suggests that the U.S. is only becoming more deeply embroiled in Yemen’s war.The U.S. will respond again if the Iran-backed rebels try another assault, White House spokesman Eric Schultz told reporters Thursday afternoon."

Unfortunately, the Clinton administration caused them a lot of harm, but also throughout the Balkans, which they made a mess out of.”Jason Miller, the senior communications advisor for the Trump campaign, called the interview a “hoax” and requested “a formal retraction and apology from all involved.”“Mr. Trump never gave an interview to the Serbian weekly magazine Nedeljnikas as falsely reported by the discredited Newsweek, nor was such an interview conducted through our Indiana State Director,” Miller said. Newsweek reported that Nedeljnik said the interview was conducted “via email correspondence with a Trump campaign senior adviser, Suzanne Ryder Jaworowski.” (The Huffington Post followed Nedeljnik and Newsweek in reporting those quotes.)Jaworowski, the Indiana state director, said in the statement from the Trump campaign that this was “completely false.” “I have never served as a conduit to interview Mr. Trump for anyone,” she said.The contested quotes reference the bombing campaigns NATO forces carried out in then-Yugoslavia in the 1990s to halt ethnic persecution and genocide. NATO bombed Bosnian Serb forces threatening United Nations “safe zones” in 1995 in order to prevent genocide like the one that occurred in Srebrenica. Four years later, NATO again deployed forces ― without U.N. authorization ― in a humanitarian mission to stop Serbian persecution of Albanians in Kosovo. Russia, however, viewed the bombing as a breach of international law.Trump appears to be popular in Serbia.

Commission on Human Rights into alleged extrajudicial killings, but on the condition that after he was questioned, he had the right to be heard.“I’ll play with you. I’m very sure they cannot be brighter than me. I will ask five questions that will humiliate you,” Duterte said. “Watch out for that, it will be a spectacle.”Duterte’s remarks came during a televised speech to hundreds of the country’s business elite, during which he said it was necessary to cleanse the streets of drug pushers and rescue the next generation of Filipinos from the scourge of narcotics.Duterte, 71, won the hearts of millions of Filipinos with his outrageous, at times comical speeches and man-of-the-people style in the run-up to a May election. He won by a huge margin after campaigning almost entirely on promises to wipe out drugs and crime.Nearly 2,300 people have died in the war on drugs since the campaign started on June 30, according to police, of which 1,566 were drug suspects killed in police operations.Police had previously said there had been more then 3,600 deaths, but have since concluded that many of that number were homicides and murders unrelated to illegal narcotics.Opinion polls for Duterte’s first 90 days in office suggest he remains popular, with a Pulse Asia survey on Wednesday showing he had the trust of 86 percent of 1,200 Filipinos surveyed.Duterte said on Wednesday he had officially invited a United Nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions to investigate the drug killings.Thursday speech was the latest among Duterte’s frequent and furious rebukes of international critics of his drugs war, after they expressed concern about the unusually high death toll and circumstances of the drugs killings.“These fools think (they can do anything) because the Philippines is a small nation,” he said. “Maybe God gave you the money but we have the brains.”"

The fiscal benefits associated with taxed and regulated marijuana wouldn’t be worthwhile, they said, because more children would end up using the drug and high drivers would terrorize the roadways.Those dire predictions haven’t come true, according a new report by the Drug Policy Alliance, a nonprofit that lobbies for progressive reform of drug laws. In fact, legalization has had a negligible effect on rates of youth marijuana use and traffic fatalities in Colorado and Washington ― and in Alaska, Oregon and Washington, D.C., which have all since approved marijuana for recreational use. At the same time, marijuana arrests have plummeted and total revenue from legal weed has surged past $500 million.“This report shows that a lot of those fears don’t come to fruition in the case of legalization,” said Joy Haviland, staff attorney at DPA. “It’s clear that prohibition has not worked, so states need a new solution going forward.”The study looked at drug use surveys of high school students in Alaska, Colorado, Oregon and Washington, which show that both current and lifetime marijuana use among youth has remained stable after legalization.Marijuana legalization has made no discernible mark on traffic fatalities in Colorado and Washington, the report finds, and total arrests for impaired driving have declined in those states. Although more Washington drivers involved in fatal crashes have tested positive for the psychoactive compound THC in recent years, the report notes that links between impairment and THC levels in a driver’s system have not been fully established. In other words, just because a driver has THC in their system at the time of an accident does not mean they were impaired. Furthermore, the report says this increase could be due to enhanced reporting and testing standards enacted in Washington post-legalization.The new marijuana laws have had a significant financial effect, the report finds. Much of this is due to savings to police and the criminal justice system, which are no longer inundated with small-time marijuana cases.In Colorado, cops made 46 percent fewer marijuana arrests between 2012 and 2014. Washington saw a 98 percent reduction in the total number of low-level marijuana court filings, from 6,879 in 2011 to only 120 in 2013. In Washington, D.C., marijuana arrests fell 85 percent from 2014 to 2015, while arrests for possession alone fell by 98 percent in the same period, to just 32 in 2015.In Oregon and Alaska, where there are still no retail weed stores, marijuana arrests have also decreased considerably in the past few years.“By no longer arresting and prosecuting possession and other low-level marijuana offenses, states are saving hundreds of millions of dollars and thousands of adults are no longer getting stopped, arrested, charged, or convicted for the unlawful possession of marijuana,” the report says.Although arrests have been scaled back, studies have shown persistent racial disparities in enforcement, with blacks and Latinos still more likely to be arrested for marijuana crimes than whites.Taxed and regulated marijuana has also generated substantial financial windfalls for Colorado and Washington. Both states exceeded sales projections last year, bringing in $129 million and $220 million, respectively.This data, while encouraging, is still preliminary, Haviland said. Retail sales of marijuana in Colorado and Washington have only been going on since 2014, and legalization measures in Alaska, Oregon and D.C. went into place last year. It could take years to get a clearer picture of the total impact of legalization, but the report does cast doubt on some of the most alarmist arguments from drug warriors.The DPA report adds to a growing body of research on the impact of legalizing marijuana at the state level. This includes a recent study by the Cato Institute, which found that there has been no convincing connection between ending weed prohibition and crime or drug abuse rates.All of this analysis is dealing with a very limited data set. But that could change soon, as voters in Arizona, California, Maine, Massachusetts and Nevada prepare to consider similar measures to legalize cannabis on Election Day. With polling showing high levels of support for the initiatives, nearly 25 percent of Americans could soon be living in states with legal weed.Reports like this suggest that would be a positive development, Haviland said.“By shifting away from drug prohibition and marijuana prohibition and instead focusing on public health, states are making positive change,” she said.Clarification: Language has been amended to indicate that, while one can purchase marijuana for recreational use at medical dispensaries in Oregon, wider retail operations have not yet begun in the state.Read the entire report below:"

87,SPORTS,Progressive Groups Fight Vegas NFL Stadium After Nevada Senate Approves $750 Million Tax Subsidy,Travis Waldron,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/las-vegas-nfl-stadium-sheldon-adelson_us_57fd3b5ae4b07b9b8752e668,"Grassroots groups warn lawmakers ""there will be consequences.""",2016-10-13,"Las Vegas Sands CEO Sheldon Adelson has pledged to put $650 million into the stadium, but only if taxpayers contribute even more.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57fec5581b0000e218ef6a75.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Nevada state senate on Tuesday approved legislation that would put $750 million in taxpayer money toward the construction of a new Las Vegas football stadium ― the first step in giving away the largest public subsidy ever for an American pro sports facility.The stadium, with an overall proposed price tag of $1.9 billion, is meant to entice the NFL’s Oakland Raiders to move to the Sin City.The senate approved the legislation ― which raises taxes on hotel rooms in Las Vegas to fund the stadium ― over the opposition of progressive, libertarian and conservative groups that argued the subsidy is a giveaway to billionaire casino mogul and Republican mega-donor Sheldon Adelson, who has pledged $650 million to the project. Raiders owner Mark Davis would contribute $500 million under the current plan.Now those groups have vowed to fight the legislation as it moves to the state assembly, which could vote on the stadium bill as soon as Thursday night. “We’re working with Republicans and Democrats on that side to see if we can stop it,” said Bob Fulkerson, the state director of the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada, or PLAN. “We’re going to get the troops rallied and get everybody there in the next couple days. The assembly is the peoples’ house. I think we can give them a good run for the money on that side.”Despite good arguments against the stadium, they are up against steep odds, including Adelson and others in the casino industry, Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval (R), and an army of lobbyists Adelson unleashed in the state legislature this year in an attempt to push the project across the finish line. Sandoval, whose political action committee has received donations from Adelson in the past, called a special legislative session to get the stadium deal done. Aside from the typical (and widely discredited) arguments about stadiums having major economic impacts, Sandoval has argued that the arrival of the Raiders will create a “new era for tourism” in Las Vegas.“Now is the time to capitalize on the opportunity before us to invest in Nevada’s most foundational industry, tourism, by providing for the infrastructure and public safety needs of the 21st century,” Sandoval said in a statement when he called the special session. “As I have said before, we can and must usher in a new era for tourism in the Las Vegas market, while keeping our citizens and visitors safe, and ensuring our position as the global leader in entertainment and hospitality.”That argument gained even more traction in the legislature Monday, when Adelson’s fellow casino magnates and other stadium backers received “almost a full day,” Fulkerson said, to persuade senators to back the legislation.“We’ve been offered a gift here,” said former Las Vegas mayor Jan Jones Blackhurst, who is now an executive at Caesars. “We’ve been offered a gift that takes us from 45 million visitors, to 55, to 65 million visitors.”But there is almost no evidence the stadium or the Raiders would have that effect. The claims that stadium backers have made about tourism increases have “no basis in reality,” said Stanford economist Roger Noll, who has studied the tourism effects of stadiums and sports teams.“No NFL stadium in the country generates tourism for regular season games that accounts for more than a few percent of attendance,” Noll said in an email to The Huffington Post. “And people who do travel for games typically spend minimal time – one night at most.”That this is Las Vegas, a city already built on tourism, only lessens the potential impact.“Because Vegas already has a lot of tourism, a tiny percentage drop in other tourism would swamp any plausible estimate of the additional tourism due to the stadium,” Noll said. Groups like PLAN have raised other objections, and complained that they received comparably little time to make their case in front of state senators during an abbreviated session Tuesday morning.“The fix was in to jam this through with as little public scrutiny as possible,” Fulkerson said. “They knew the more the public got to look at this, the more they would vomit all over it.”Nevada, the groups argue, is already facing a potential $400 million budget deficit over the next two years. The existing hotel tax, meanwhile, is meant to help fund education, and raising it to fund the stadium could make it harder to find new revenue sources for gaps in education funding in the future. In addition, state taxpayers will be on the hook for any gaps in funding if the hotel tax fails to meet revenue projections ― a regular occurrence in stadium financing plans.“We have a woefully underfunded education system. We can’t build new schools ... because we don’t have the money for it,” said Annette Magnus, the executive director of Battle Born Progress, another progressive group fighting the deal. “We haven’t properly funded our mental health system since the ‘90s. They’re going to have to balance this budget, so they’re going to have to cut critical services. But they’re willing raise a tax to build a billionaire a stadium.”Nevada political observers have already predicted that the legislation will pass the state assembly during the special session. But at least on the progressive side, the groups that oppose the legislation are pulling out last-second stops in an effort to persuade Democratic assembly members to oppose the plan.“We’re letting them know, there will be consequences. There will be primaries,” Fulkerson said. “The left has a chance to take out some of the people who have betrayed us.”If they vote in favor of the stadium, he said, “We’re going to make sure it hurts them.”"
