A rejection by the center-left Labor party, which wants same-sex marriages legalized by parliament, ended any hope the plebiscite bill could pass.A plebiscite represented an “unnecessary detour ... through difficult terrain,” Janet Rice, the Greens Party spokeswoman for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex affairs, told reporters.“It is at least insensitive to the LGBT community ... and at best, it will result in divisive hurtful campaigning with no guarantee of progressing marriage equality,” she added."

3,POLITICS,Here’s What Could Happen If Donald Trump Doesn’t Accept The Election Results,Julia Craven,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-accept-election-results_us_582094f8e4b0aac6248591c7,This is scary stuff.,2016-11-07,"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump addresses a campaign rally in Leesburg, Virginia. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/582095c41600002f002c8d30.jpeg?cache=ci1GDMi9hV&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Samuel J. Tilden had a problem. It was 1876, and the Democratic presidential nominee was one vote shy of the 185 Electoral College votes needed to secure the nation’s highest office. Tilden had swept the popular vote, winning 247,448 more ballots than his opponent Rutherford B. Hayes ― who also lagged behind in Electoral College votes, with 165. But 20 votes had not been counted: one from Oregon, four from Florida, eight from Louisiana and seven from South Carolina. Democratic candidates had used fraud and violence to sweep the state-level elections in the South. But since Republicans still maintained control of the state electoral boards, they could throw out votes in order to secure Hayes a win. On March 5, 1877, an Electoral Commission established by Congress confirmed Hayes would be America’s 19th president. During this political upheaval, there were talks of civil unrest, and fears of a second Civil War or the election being rigged to favor a candidate who better served the interests of the party in power. But Tilden, who had pretty good reason to think he was cheated, did not question the legitimacy of the results and conceded the election.Current Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump may not be as gracious. During the final presidential debate, Trump refused to say he would accept the election results in the contest against Hillary Clinton. In fact, as his chances of winning have dropped, his claims that the election is rigged against him have increased. (And, unlike Tilden, Trump doesn’t have a case.)Fifty-six percent of Americans think Trump should concede if he loses on Tuesday, and 31 percent of those who believe he should concede think it would be a major threat to U.S. democracy if he doesn’t, according to a HuffPost/YouGov poll conducted this month.Along party lines, the divide gets more stark. Only 48 percent of Republicans think Trump should concede if Clinton is declared the winner, compared to 77 percent of Democrats, based on the HuffPost/YouGov poll. Eighty-six percent of Republicans surveyed believe Clinton should concede versus 67 percent of Democrats.Some political reporters and experts have argued that it doesn’t matter whether Trump accepts the election outcome. To some extent, they’re right: If Trump loses, he’ll have few legal recourses to contest the result. But what if Trump doesn’t concede? “Ever since Thomas Jefferson effected the first change in party power in 1800, our democracy has depended upon the peaceful transfer of power and the idea of an opposition — but a loyal opposition,” Allan Lichtman, a political historian at American University, told The Huffington Post. “Is Trump going to change 200 years of American history?”No one knows. But Trump refusing to concede would flip the bird to a long American tradition of accepting a loss in a presidential election. And refusing to bow out peacefully could have real-life consequences. Here are a few:Undermining The Next PresidentMany of Trump’s supporters think the election is rigged. Nearly half do not believe their votes will be counted, according to a Politico/Morning Consult poll. This could make it difficult or impossible for Clinton to govern, Lichtman said.“If people don’t accept the legitimacy of the president, that could spread to lawmakers,” he said. Trump’s lack of willingness to concede could make it more difficult for Republicans in Congress to compromise as well as harder for the sitting president to muster public support for any issue she wants to pursue.But Republicans in Congress are already reluctant to compromise with the current Democratic president. One reason is because of the birther movement, a racist crusade led by Trump in an attempt to delegitimize President Barack Obama’s place in the White House. And, in January, at least 53 percent of Republicans still questioned whether Obama is American.Triggering ViolenceThe most commonly cited danger of Trump refusing to accept the election outcome is that it could lead to violence.The idea isn’t so far-fetched. Trump rally attendees have physically and verbally abused protesters. Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke encouraged his fellow Trump supporters to take up pitchforks and torches following claims of a rigged election. And attacks on Clinton are even more vicious. In July, one Trump supporter said Clinton should be executed via firing squad. Trump himself suggested Clinton should be shot during a campaign rally in August. Another supporter followed suit in October, saying Clinton “needs to be taken out,” before adding, “If I have to be a patriot, I will.”And half of likely voters fear that violence may happen on Election Day, according to an October USA Today/Suffolk University poll. Undermining DemocracyThere’s also a threat that Trump refusing to concede could undermine democracy itself.It sounds extreme. But peaceful transfers of power have kept America a stable democracy for centuries. If that tradition ends, it could shake the belief that democracy is effective and cause voters to become more apathetic or adopt a more extreme political ideology.  Voters should think about how elections work in developing countries, argued Mark Tessler, a political science professor at the University of Michigan. In 2007, he notes, an unclear election result in Kenya triggered violence that killed more than 1,300 people and displaced 600,000 more.“If people think elections are unfair or rigged or fraudulent in some important way, this has an important impact on their basic commitment to democracy,” he said. Dissenters are often people who had economic or political grievances before the election and are looking for a solution. “The election,” Tessler said, “is kind of a sign that nothing is going to change.” Many of Trump’s supporters fit this bill ― they think they don’t have a say in the political system and that it operates against them. “Some of the people who are gravitating ... to Trump are people who feel, rightly or wrongly, that the system doesn’t care about them,” Tessler said. “Belief that the election is rigged may be a confirmation of that in their minds.”Ariel Edwards-Levy contributed reporting.  The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Nov. 3-5 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov’s nationally representative opinion polling.

The people who are coming to town now are just so open.” It isn’t just the music scene that’s changed in the three years since the release of Herndon’s last album, “Lies I Told Myself.” In November 2014, the 54-year-old came out as a “proud and happy gay man” in an interview with People magazine after nearly two decades in the music industry. Looking back, he said he decided to address his sexuality publicly in spite of the fact that he “didn’t even know if I’d still get to be doing music afterward.” To his surprise, Herndon received “awesome” support from fans and fellow artists, and thus felt encouraged to break out of his comfort zone, both lyrically and musically, when he headed back into the studio. Due out Nov. 11, “House on Fire” is a 12-song “musical journey” that sees Herndon coming to terms with his authentic self while incorporating modern electronic elements into his signature sound.Fans got their first taste of “House on Fire” in October with the anthemic first single, “That Kind of Night.” As rollicking as “That Kind of Night” is, the rest of the album sees Herndon delving into deeper territory. The title track, he said, nods to how he’s reconciled with his religious faith since coming out, while “Sweet Way to Go” is a tribute to Matt Collum, his partner of eight years. Watch the video for “That Kind of Night” below. Interestingly, “House on Fire” is a bit of a musical anomaly in that none of its 12 songs include gender-specific pronouns — a fact which Herndon insists that this was not a conscious effort but rather a fortunate “accident.” As much as his coming out struggles have informed his songwriting, Herndon is hopeful “House on Fire” relays an all-inclusive message that will resound as much with listeners who identify as LGBTQ as those who don’t. “Every lyric, everything in this album ― I’ve lived it,” he told HuffPost. “And if I’ve lived it, most likely somebody else has, too.”That isn’t to say that “House on Fire” isn’t meant to speak to queer listeners specifically, as evidenced by the album’s closing ballad, “Fighter.” Noting that he’d almost “lost his life” on more than one occasion prior to his coming out, Herndon told HuffPost that the song is his way of expressing solidarity with bullied youth. “So many of us today are fighting for our identity, fighting to be who we are,” he said. (Proceeds from the sales of “Fighter” are being donated to The Trevor Project, the country’s largest LGBTQ youth advocacy and suicide prevention organization.)Regardless of how “House on Fire” is received, Herndon already sees the album as his greatest effort toward “changing hearts and minds, and tearing down walls, in Nashville,” thus far. To that point, he’s kept active on other fronts, too, speaking out against anti-LGBTQ legislation in Tennessee and lending his voice to “Slow Down,” a song by country artist Brandon Stansell, who identifies as gay. “The more successful anyone that’s in the LGBTQ community is in anything they want to do in life sets a great example for the kids that are coming up,” he said. “I just don’t want to see a kid feel like they can’t do what they love. I felt that way for a long time, and it was not a good place to be in.” "

6,POLITICS,"Trump Hotels Buck Industry Trend, Continue To Offer Guests Porn",Lance Gould,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-hotels-porn_us_581e2a45e4b0e80b02ca69e6,"While many name-brand hotel chains have severed ties with the adult film industry, Trump hotels have not.",2016-11-07,The Trump International Hotel & Tower Las Vegas -- one of the six U.S.-based Trump hotels to offer on-demand adult films.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5820c8b91600002e002c8e4b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As much of the U.S. hotel industry has moved away from offering adult films to guests, one notable chain has resisted the change.Most Trump hotels in the United States continue to make adult films available in their rooms as an on-demand amenity. Of the eight U.S.-based Trump hotels, six offer the service to clients, making the chain a holdout in an industry that has increasingly taken steps away from profiting from pornography.Considering some of Donald Trump’s outrageously sexist statements and actions, this may not come as a surprise. The real estate mogul and GOP presidential nominee has even made a cameo in a soft-core porn movie.But Trump Hotels’ continued porn offerings further illustrate the strange-bedfellows relationship Trump has forged with the religious elements of his party, boasting endorsements from conservative activist and Liberty University president Jerry Falwell Jr. and Focus on the Family founder James Dobson, among others. When The Huffington Post called various U.S. Trump hotels to ask about amenities they offered, employees in Honolulu, Chicago, Las Vegas, two New York City locales and the Washington D.C. locale on Pennsylvania Avenue ― just a few blocks from the White House ― confirmed that on-demand adult films were available in guest rooms.On-demand adult film services were not available in two other Trump properties: the Albemarle Estate at Trump Winery in Virginia and the Trump National Doral Miami in Florida, both located in the South.While three-quarters of U.S.-based Trump hotels continue to offer pornographic films to their guests, hotels elsewhere across the country have moved to sever their ties to the adult film industry.According to the nonpartisan nonprofit National Center on Sexual Exploitation, the following hotel companies have recently changed their policies regarding adult films, and will no longer offer hardcore porn to their guests:InterContinental Hotels Group (which includes brands such as Crowne Plaza, Holiday Inn, Candlewood and more);Those organizations have joined Omni Hotels & Resorts, Drury Hotels, Hilton Worldwide and Marriott Hotels, which either no longer sell or have never sold pornography.Nordic Choice Hotels established a new set of ethical guidelines in 2013 and “quickly concluded that offering pay TV porn did not fit with our profile, nor with our guests’ modernizing preferences,” board chair Petter Stordalen wrote in an email to HuffPost.“The two most important parameters for Nordic Choice Hotels are our guests’ wishes, and whether our policy decisions are ethically sound,” Stordalen continued. “In the case of adult films, these two add up to a clear ‘no, thank you’. I believe a lot of hotel companies have figured that out already, and that more will follow in the future.”So while many of the most recognized brands in the hotel industry no longer offer adult films, that’s not the case for Trump Hotels ― named for a man who appeared on the cover of Playboy magazine, boasted of sexually assaulting women, falsely accused one of his female detractors of making a sex tape, bragged about sneaking backstage at the Miss Universe contest to “inspect” women’s bodies and dismissed abuse allegations from an adult film star by saying, “Oh, I’m sure she’s never been grabbed before.”Trump Hotels’ porn-friendly policy also stands in stark contrast to Trump’s vow this summer to crack down on pornography by signing a pledge written by the anti-pornography group Enough Is Enough.Trump hotel publicists did not immediately reply to a request for comment from HuffPost.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
7,POLITICS,Donald Trump Breaks 40-Year Bipartisan Tradition By Not Releasing Tax Returns,Igor Bobic,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-tax-returns_us_5820c196e4b0d9ce6fbd9e3c,Shame.,2016-11-07,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump could have answered legitimate questions about his candidacy and character by releasing his tax returns, but he refused to do so.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5820e338150000b700532382.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It’s official: Donald Trump is the first major party nominee since Gerald Ford not to release his tax returns during the presidential campaign.The Republican nominee announced his bid for the White House on June 16, 2015, from the lobby of Trump Tower, the gleaming Manhattan symbol of his real estate empire. Almost immediately after he did so, questions began to swirl about his net worth and how much of it he would use to bankroll his campaign.So the following month, in July, Trump’s campaign filed a disclosure with the FEC and issued a statement that claimed he has a “massive” net worth that is “in excess of TEN BILLION DOLLARS.” At the time, Forbes listed his net worth at merely $4.5 billion. Earlier this year, Forbes re-evaluated the number at $3.7 billion, down $800 million from 2015.Initially, the media reacted to the statement, capital letters and all, with amusement. It was at the time considered as unserious as Trump’s candidacy ― conventional wisdom that soon fell apart. But the episode was an early sign as to how Trump planned to run for president ― evading transparency and accountability at every turn by refusing to release the very document that could unravel the narrative he sold of a successful, wealthy and charitable businessman.The Washington Post’s David Fahrenthold, in particular, had an instrumental role this election with his intrepid reporting on the Trump Foundation, the candidate’s New York-based private foundation. Trump and his campaign often boast about his “millions” in charitable giving, but the numbers could not be independently verified without a copy of his tax returns. The Post reported the businessman actually used the organization to give away somebody else’s money and claim the credit for himself. And in another bizarre twist, Trump used charity money to purchase a 6-foot-tall portrait of himself.Trump’s tax returns could also offer answers to questions about his business dealings abroad ― especially in adversarial countries like Russia. During the campaign, Democrats suggested he refused to do so because he was beholden to leaders like Russian President Vladimir Putin, a man Trump has praised at length.The GOP nominee’s explanation as to why he could not release his tax returns ― because, as he says, they are under IRS audit ― has always been nonsensical. Richard Nixon, for example, released his tax returns under audit. Moreover, there is nothing stopping Trump from disclosing tax returns for years not currently under audit.The decision to withhold the information has also caused headaches for his family and campaign staff, who have struggled at times to defend the position. Eric Trump, for example, admitted it would be “foolish” for his father to release the returns. Donald Trump Jr., his other son, has said the move would simply invite too much scrutiny from ordinary people.Far more concerning, however, is the precedent Trump may have created for future nominees. If he loses by a smaller-than-expected margin on Tuesday, the real estate mogul will have created a path for other candidates to run a viable campaign for president while withholding sensitive but pertinent information from the voters.

Kardashian West said her severe stress often flared up when she was driving, while Jenner was experiencing persistent anxiety due to issues with sleep paralysis.The two eventually sought help from a mental health professional during the episode and participated in a meditation exercise, which research shows may be effective in helping abate symptoms of anxiety.The stars’ experiences provide further proof that anxiety can affect anyone and manifest for myriad reasons. Anxiety is not a character flaw or a bid for attention. The condition, which affects more than 40 million American adults, can cause incessant rumination, panic and worry ― sometimes over nothing. The disorder can also lead to physical symptoms, such as headaches and stomach issues.Kardashian West confessed on the show, which which was filmed before she was robbed in a Paris hotel last month, that she hopes to find a way to make the condition more manageable so it doesn’t interfere with her daily routine.“I think about it all the time, it drives me crazy,” she told her therapist during the episode. “I just want to get past my anxiety and live life… I never had anxiety and I want to take back my life.”As many people with anxiety can attest, this sounds all too familiar.H/T People"

Instead, a Missouri TV station obtained a photo that appears to show one of the responding officers flashing a smile and giving a thumbs-up sign to a forensic camera while posing with the lifeless body of 28-year-old Omar Rahman.“She’s very disturbed. I guess the best words to describe her are she’s very saddened,” the family’s attorney, Antonio Romanucci, told The Huffington Post about Staton on Monday.Staton’s son died at a St. Louis County home on Aug. 8 from what was ruled an accidental drug overdose, KMOV-TV reported. The North County Police Cooperative responded to the home. Staton said she did not think the officers’ behavior could be justified.“Because when they come to a call, they’re supposed to be there to help and protect, not doing what he was doing with thumbs up and a smirk on his face,” she told KMOV.Romanucci also called the officers’ actions inexcusable.“I’ve been doing this a long, long time,” he said. “I’ve seen thousands and thousands of forensic videos and forensic photographs, and I’ve never seen anything as disgusting as this. Really, I have not.”“There are racial undertones, there are implications [that] no training has been provided in sensitivity,” he added. “Clearly there are implications here that these officers have been doing this on more than one occasion … and it’s just shocking that this is the cooperative where Ferguson happened, less than two years ago,” he said referencing the riots that followed a white police officer fatally shooting Michael Brown, a black man. The police cooperative has threatened to sue KMOV-TV for not returning the photo, the station reported. It first broke the story after obtaining the picture from a law enforcement source.An attorney for the cooperative is accusing KMOV-TV of harboring stolen property and impending their investigation, according to letters the new station has published.The North County Cooperative did not respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment.Romanucci said he is leaning toward taking legal action against the police group.“I’ve been making an attempt to obtain records from the North County Cooperative for about four weeks, under [the Freedom of Information Act]. They have not been cooperative,” he told HuffPost. “I don’t especially now anticipate that I will get anything. If I do, it will be miraculous.”Romanucci has requested to see a list of everyone who has accessed the forensic camera in the last two years, and wants the camera to be preserved.He also wants to see all of the photos that were taken from the forensic camera, “to see whether or not there is a custom or practice that is going on in the North County Cooperative that is clearly nefarious and unconstitutional.”"

As a little girl, I dreamed of the day that I might have the chance to cast my vote for a woman president. I want to fully feel the excitement of this moment, but right now I am just exhausted.So I have chosen to focus my thoughts this week on reflection and remembrance instead: on rekindling the hope that history is long, our democracy is strong and we can all get through this together.It’s easy to lose sight of the fact that we are living through a seminal moment in American history.There is a distinct possibility that we are about to elect a female president for the first time in our nation’s history. In the grand scheme of things, this is watershed. In addition to Democratic Nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton, Green Party candidate Jill Stein is also on the ballot. And eight years ago, the Republican ticket featured VP candidate Sarah Palin.One hundred years ago, this possibility was unthinkable. To many even today, it remains unthinkable. It was less than a century ago when women were first granted the right to vote, in 1920. It did not come easily. Progress does not come easily.Let us not forget the sacrifices of our mothers and foremothers whose battles won us a voice in political life. From visionary firebrand Victoria Woodhull to the black girl magic of Shirley Chisholm, generations of American women have brought us to this day.We owe so much of our present—and our future—to the past. We are reminded of this by the “I Voted” stickers women are placing on suffragette Susan B. Anthony’s gravestone. We see it in the faces of all of the grandmothers who can’t believe they have the chance to vote for a female president in their lifetime.Much of women’s history is a history lost. Listen to their voices, remember their stories, for they are part of our own stories and the great American story.From here on out, I am shutting off the television and not refreshing any more polls. I am curling up with my hot mug of tea and watching “Suffragette” on HBO.I am doing what I do when I want to calm down and refocus. I am listening to music, to anthems of survival and triumph from women who have shaken off what the world expects of them. It is the soundtrack of our history being fought for and won.“Listen, to the song here in my heart,” sings Beyonce in a soaring track from ‘Dreamgirls.’So I am quiet and I listen.I close my eyes and imagine the walk to the polling place and the walk home, leaf by leaf, brick by brick, as I too take part in the long march of history.I am thankful to be witness to this moment. I am grateful in my life to have been shaped by so many bright, brave women who made me who I am today. I am grateful for all of the grandmothers across this great country who have lived to see this day—and those who haven’t, but live on in our hearts.From the deep, I hear a song rising. I hear the words that echo down through the past, that sweep past us and urge us ever onward. Turn your face up. Feel the wind. Don’t let anyone take this moment, your voice, your glory from you.History is ours to make.Check out my playlist of girl power anthems in celebration of this moment in women’s history."

Mr. Trump, a hot-headed businessman who did not pay his taxes for many years, aims to grab women between their legs without consent, create a wall between the Mexico–United States border and remove all Muslims from the United States if he becomes President. Whereas, Hillary Clinton, a champion for the working class, has a dream to create a better America for all Americans regardless of their race, faith or sexual orientation. This is why I support Hillary Clinton to be President Obama’s successor.“There has never been a man or a woman more qualified than Hillary Clinton to serve as the President of the United States of America,” said President Obama about Hillary Clinton. Even the New York Times and Washington Post, two newspapers that reported about Clinton’s misuse of private emails as Secretary of State, endorsed Hillary for her efforts to create economic and social development from below, stating that “Hillary has shown herself to be a leader who has managed to translate visions into practical action for the benefit of millions of people, not only in America, but also in many other countries like Bangladesh.” However, this is just a snapshot of the admiration for Clinton, who wrote “It Takes a Village” to present her vision for children around the world. As First Lady of Arkansas, she led a task force whose recommendations helped reform Arkansas’s public schools. She also invited Muhammad Yunus to launch a Grameen Bank type project to help poor Arkansans break their cycle of poverty. As a First Lady of the United States, she helped create the State Children’s Insurance Program. She also visited Bangladesh to meet with poor women of the Grameen Bank. As the first female senator of New York, she took a leading role in investigating the health issues faced by 9/11 first responders and victims. As Secretary of State, she fought for poor women around the world. She visited Dhaka many times to convince Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina not to break the Grameen Bank into 18 piece.However, Donald Trump has a different opinion of Clinton. He considers Hillary a devil, stating that “she is a nasty lady who is supposed to be in jail for using a private email address during her tenure as a secretary of state.” Trump not only caused a firestorm but also revealed a profoundly distorted view held by the GOP. This shows that Republicans will do anything, even spit in the face of a woman who has served America for more than three decades. Thus, I will vote for Hillary on Nov. 8th for three reasons: (1) She helped kill Osama bin Laden; (2) She saved Grameen Bank, which is owned by the 10 million poor women of Bangladesh, from Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina; and (3) She did not break any laws by using a private email account.(1) The Killing of Osama bin Laden:It was September 11, 2001—the day Rakibul, my only brother, survived. I was working at LaGuardia Community College when terrorists attacked the Twin Towers. My brother was in the South Tower (World Trade Center II), so I ran there as soon as news broke out about the attack. As soon as I arrived near 1 Liberty Plaza, I got caught in the fallout of the first collapse (North Tower) but continued running toward the South Tower to find my brother. However, I couldn't outrun the smoke and had to crawl under a van to avoid the debris. I started choking, and my eyes burned; the air had turned black. I thought the van would move and kill me. Someone dragged me into the van, and I later found myself in a hospital. In a panic, I fled the hospital and ran toward the Twin Towers again with the hope of seeing my brother there. I went north on the West Side Highway, along with thousands of other terrified people. I waited there all day, watching everything go down, including the fall of the South Tower, but I did not see my brother. I saw men and women jumping from windows in a desperate bid to escape the fire within. I saw them hit the ground—saw their blood on the street. I had, until now, forgotten all about these horrors (probably because, by a miracle, my brother survived). On that day, however, I decided to dedicate my life to eradicating terrorism through education. My efforts gained momentum when I got into NYU as a CRISP Scholar. While there, I spent a lot of time at the Bobst Library, where I wrote many Anti-Islamic State articles, such as “Trial of Malala,” “Taliban Terror,” “I’m Muslim & I’m Charlie,” “Terror of Islamic State,” “To be Muslim and not to Be?,” “I’m Muslim & I Love Gays” and “Make Islam Great Again.” This is why I was ecstatic when the combined leadership of President Obama and Hillary Clinton put an end to Osama bin Laden.(2) Saving Grameen Bank from Sheikh Hasina:It was April 4, 1995. Hillary and Chelsea Clinton sat on a military transport as it bumped along from Dhaka, Bangladesh to the rural southwest of the country, Jessore. They both wore Grameen Check, a typical dress made famous by Muhammad Yunus, the founder of the Grameen Bank. A group of Grameen borrowers, most of whom were lower caste Hindus known as “untouchables,” were waiting to meet with Hillary and Chelsea and ask them questions about their status and self-reliance as women. As soon as Hillary arrived in Jessore, they asked her a series of questions, such as ""Do you have cattle in your house?""""No,"" Hillary smiled in acknowledgment of a world in which the difference between one cow and a few cows in a household is the difference between night and day. In 1983, Hillary invited Yunus to travel to Arkansas to help her set up micro-credit programs in Little Rock. Since that time, during her 1995 travels to Bangladesh and around the world, she has had the opportunity to meet many Grameen program participants and hear the ways in which these loans have transformed their lives. To this day, I continue to be inspired by the beneficial impact of these projects on low-income women and their families. Thus, I decided to meet former president Bill Clinton in 2004 to gain his support in translating his book, My Life, for the Weekly Tikana. I also translated Hillary Clinton’s biopic, Living History, for the Bangla Patrika. I even published a book about Bill and Hillary in 2006.Ivy League Love Story (আইভিলিগ লাভ স্টোরি)""When Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina removed Yunus from Grameen Bank and wanted to break the bank into 18 pieces, Hillary made many trips to Bangladesh to meet with Hasina personally. She was able to convince her that Grameen was the bank not only of Muhammad Yunus but also of the impoverished 10 million. As Secretary of State, she had no obligation to save a bank in Bangladesh, yet she did it anyway because she cares about the poor.(3) The Trial of Hillary ClintonFBI Chief James Comey told Congress at a July 7th House hearing that the investigation of Clinton’s emails was closed. However, on Oct. 28th, he sent a letter to Congress stating that the FBI would review new information in the case. The letter read: “In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.” From there, the attack on Hillary has unfolded like a fable, with Trump unveiling one allegation after another. These have included claims that Hillary is too corrupt to be a president and that Republicans will impeach her if she becomes President. Trump’s disparaging behavior comes at a time when we need to join together to end the Islamic State, an epidemic which is the result of wrong foreign policies by the Republican party. Therefore, instead of taking this to the Supreme Court (because Trump believes the decision will be rigged), let’s take this case to the Court of Solomon (the Son of David, according to the Old Testament) to see whether Hillary has broken the law:Hillary and Trump are now at the imaginary Court of King Solomon (President Obama and FBI Chief James Comey are also present). Hillary claims that she has worked all her life to promote education, cure AIDS and eradicate poverty. She also admits that she made a mistake by using a private email account. Trump claims that he has a monopoly over America as a billionaire businessman and, thereby, should win the election. He also claims that Hillary should be in jail because she has broken the law by using a private email account. After interviewing Trump and Hillary, King Solomon wants to ask FBI Chief James Comey a few questions:King Solomon: When did Clinton set up her private server, and where was it located?James Comey: While she was a senator and during her 2008 presidential campaign. She continued to use her personal email throughout her term as Secretary of State.Solomon: Was she allowed to use her personal email for government business?Comey: Yes, the occasional use of a personal email account is permitted in certain circumstances, such as emergencies.Solomon: Was she allowed to use a private server?Comey: No.Solomon: Did Clinton seek government approval to use a private server for her personal email account?Comey: No.Solomon: Did other secretaries of state use personal emails for government business?Comey: Yes, such as Mr. Colin Powell.Solomon: Did Clinton have a government email account?Comey: No, she declined to have one setup for her.Solomon: When did the public learn that Hillary used a personal email account to conduct government business?Comey: It was not known that Clinton used her private email account exclusively for government business until the New York Times broke the story on March 2, 2015.Solomon: Were any work-related emails intentionally deleted?Comey: There is no evidence to date that work-related emails were intentionally deleted.Solomon: When did the FBI began its investigation, and why?Comey: We decided to investigate after the New York Times and Washington Post reported about it. By the end of July 2015, we had reviewed all of Hillary’s emails and found that four of them contained classified information.Solomon: Did Clinton or her staff violate any federal laws or policies?Comey: Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.Solomon: Is the FBI investigation on Hillary’s emails closed?Comey: No, we have reopened the investigation.Solomon: Why did you write an open letter to Congress disclosing it 11 days before the election? Aren’t you aware this action will severely disrupt the election?Comey: I did it in the best interest of the American people.Solomon [looks at President Obama and asks him the following question]: Did Mr. Comey violate the Hatch Act, which prohibits the abuse of power by government employees near election time?President Obama: We don’t operate on incomplete information. We don’t operate on leaks. We operate based on concrete decisions that are made.After some thought, King Solomon ordered America to be divided into two pieces: Red America, which was to be ruled by Trump, and Blue America, which was to be ruled by Hillary. By doing this, Solomon was able to observe their reactions and determine the true lover of America. Upon hearing this terrible verdict, Hillary cried out, “Please, my lord, give him the presidency but do not break America into two pieces.” However, Trump, in his bitter arrogance, exclaimed, “It shall be divided into two pieces, and I shall be the President of Red America.”Realizing that Hillary Clinton was the true lover of America, King Solomon instantly announced her to be the 45th President of the United States of America.I digress, but the above imaginary court of King Solomon offers an important lesson: Republican candidate Donald Trump has become a monster, and his propaganda against Hillary has influenced many people, including Comey. However, Trump’s profound mistake is not that he has detailed the adverse effects of Hillary’s use of a private email account but, rather, that he wants to impeach her if she becomes President.One does not have to be Einstein to understand that the work of great people—including Isaac Newton and, yes, Albert Einstein, himself—is tied to trials and tribulations. Every invention, innovation, theory, concept (e.g., Gravity) and executive decision (e.g., Using a personal email account for convenience) has its own humiliating shortcomings. Yes, we can argue that Hillary should have never used a private email account or that she should have done more to eradicate poverty through the Clinton Foundation. Instead, Trump turns on her and says, “Hillary, you are a nasty lady, and you should be in jail.”Let’s not vote for a man who will divide us into a Red and Blue America. Instead, let’s vote for unity. Let’s vote Hillary, who believes there is only one America—the United States of America.Rashidul Bari teaches Mathematics at the College of Staten Island and Physics at Brooklyn Tech.

14,POLITICS,Donald Trump Finally Said Something Concrete About Climate Policy,Kate Sheppard,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-climate-change-policy_us_581f57bde4b0e80b02caa351,And it was very bad.,2016-11-06,"A demonstrator holds a sign in protest of Trump's climate change policies ahead of early voting in Athens, Ohio, on Saturday, Oct. 29.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/581f64551600002e002c8b1e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump has said very little about climate change during this campaign. We’ve mostly had to rely on his numerous pre-candidacy tweets declaring it a “bullshit” “hoax.”But last week Trump finally did say something real about climate change ― that he would cut all federal spending on the issue in order to save $100 billion over two terms in office. Bloomberg BNA caught this particular nugget buried in the “New Deal for Black America” plan Trump released last week, which pledges to “cancel all wasteful climate change spending.” He made a similar pledge at a Michigan rally a few days ago: “We’re going to put America first. That includes canceling billions in climate change spending for the United Nations, a number Hillary wants to increase, and instead use that money to provide for American infrastructure including clean water, clean air and safety.”The BNA article suggests that number is bonkers, but doesn’t say it directly. But it is ― to get anywhere near $100 billion, one would have to cut all the money the Department of Energy spends on technology development and deployment. That’s on top of cutting funding for climate science research, international development funding and funding to help U.S. communities deal with climate-related changes, and all that still probably wouldn’t get you to $100 billion in savings. Climate Progress’s Joe Romm spells out why this is bad math, as well as bad policy.The fact that this pledge is included in his plan for black Americans is also absurd. Non-whiteAmericans are actually much more concerned about climate change than white Americans. They’re also more likely to feel its impacts.But Trump’s proposal doesn’t even jibe with things the candidate has previously said. In September he said that there’s “still much that needs to be investigated in the field of ‘climate change.’” He also said that “perhaps we should be focused on developing energy sources and power production that alleviates the need for dependence on fossil fuels.” Perhaps!In some ways, Trump’s pledge is useful in that it is a real policy statement on climate, and those have been hard to come by in his campaign (other than that he wants more coal, more oil, and more natural gas.) Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, has released extremely detailed policy proposals. People may agree with them or not, but at least they exist.But what we do know about Trump’s policies is that they would be a real disaster. It is particularly notable that this week is the start of a very important climate summit in Marrakech, Morocco, where negotiators from around the world are working out an implementation plan for last year’s Paris climate agreement. Trump has said he would “renegotiate” the Paris deal, prompting even China to criticize the Republican’s position last week.John Morton, the director for energy and climate change for the White House’s National Security Council, mostly skirted the Trump question in a call with reporters last week heading into the Marrakech meeting. “Obviously, I think there is a great deal of interest not just domestically but internationally,” said Morton. “The candidates have very different views on climate.”You don’t say. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) thinks there’s a good chance President Barack Obama will get his nominee on the Supreme Court this year if Hillary Clinton wins the election Tuesday.“My prediction is this: if Hillary Clinton wins next Tuesday, Garland will be confirmed before January,” Isakson told The Atlanta Journal Constitution Friday. “He’s probably a lot more conservative than anybody she would appoint. If Donald Trump wins, there probably won’t be a confirmation of Merrick Garland.”Obama nominated Garland, the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, on March 16 to replace the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia. Garland has never even received a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee because Republicans refused to confirm a justice before the election. They hoped, of course, that a Republican would win the presidential election and they could get another conservative to replace Scalia. Isakson’s comments, however, reflect the grudging acknowledgment by many Republicans that Trump continues to trail Clinton and seems likely to lose. A Clinton win would present the GOP with the exact scenario that Isakson presented: Confirm Garland, widely known to be a more moderate judge, or let Clinton choose someone potentially far more liberal ― an especially likely outcome if the Senate flips to Democratic control in this election.Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) also recently said that confirming Garland before January if Clinton wins is the best option for Republicans. “If Hillary Clinton is president-elect then we should move forward with hearings in the lame duck,” he said. “That’s what I’m encouraging my colleagues to do.”But other Republicans are already advocating for a different strategy: Double down and don’t confirm any justices nominated by a Democratic president, even if that means the Supreme Court stays at eight members. “If Hillary Clinton becomes president, I am going to do everything I can do to make sure four years from now, we still got an opening on the Supreme Court,” Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) said. “I promise you that we will be united against any Supreme Court nominee that Hillary Clinton, if she were president, would put up. I promise you,” Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) also said.These comments directly contradict Republicans’ initial excuse for refusing to move forward on Garland. Their stated rationale was that the public deserved a say, through the election, in deciding whether the next justice will be liberal or conservative. Burr himself said, “The American people deserve a voice in the nomination of the next Supreme Court justice.”Apparently, that voice is relevant only if it goes for Donald Trump.Vice presidential nominee Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) told The Huffington Post in a recent interview that, if Republicans do dig their heels into the ground, Democrats would move to eliminate rules allowing a minority of senators to block Supreme Court nominees.“I was in the Senate when the Republicans’ stonewalling around appointments caused the Senate Democratic majority to switch the vote threshold on appointments from 60 to 51. And we did it on everything but a Supreme Court justice,” Kaine said. “If these guys think they’re going to stonewall the filling of that vacancy or other vacancies, then a Democratic Senate majority will say, ‘We’re not going to let you thwart the law.’”CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified Tim Kaine as a Republican.HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

She’ll go back there again Monday. So will the sitting Democratic president.Is one to gather, then, that Michigan is a surprise, end-of-campaign swing state?Not according to top campaign officials, who insisted Saturday that they fully expect to win the state’s 16 electoral votes on Election Day, and that the flurry of appearances simply amounts to an insurance policy.“I think we’re going to win Michigan. We just wanted to make sure we’re doing everything we can to turn people out there,” campaign manager Robby Mook told reporters en route to an evening campaign rally in Philadelphia. “Part of why we want to be in Grand Rapids is we think we have the opportunity to pull in some late deciders there.”Just two weeks after aggressively focusing on down-ballot House and Senate seats in the belief that it had a comfortable lead, the Clinton campaign is devoting its most precious asset at this stage of the campaign ― the time of its candidate and top surrogates ― to a state that voted for President Barack Obama by nearly 10 points four years ago.Recent public polls suggest a tightening race in Michigan, although an average of polls continues to show Hillary Clinton leading Republican nominee Donald Trump there by 6 points.Mook said that focusing on Michigan, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire now, rather than a few weeks ago, makes sense because those states do not have much in the way of early voting. The campaign previously focused on Florida, North Carolina and other states that did have a lot of early voting, he said, which made it possible to bank many if not most of the ballots it expects to win from those states prior to Election Day.“We’re building a lead that will be harder and harder for Donald Trump to overcome,” Mook said.He compared Clinton’s schedule in the remaining two days to Trump’s, which has him appearing in tight battleground states but also places like Minnesota and Virginia, where he is much further behind.“Trump is basically going everywhere over those last few days and just cramming in every single state. As far as I’m concerned, the more time he spends in Minnesota and Nevada, the better,” Mook said. “In Michigan, almost all voting happens on Election Day, [like] Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and even Ohio. So our schedule is calibrated around that.”Campaign communications director Jennifer Palmieri said the first priority is still getting Clinton to an Electoral College majority. “The states they will be in on the final days are likely to provide the 270th electoral vote,” she said.The Trump campaign, meanwhile, canceled a planned trip to Wisconsin Sunday. It plans to send Trump to Iowa, Minnesota, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania (again) and New Hampshire."
17,POLITICS,"Despite What His Campaign Says, Donald Trump Supported The Bank Bailout",Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-bank-bailout_us_581f5893e4b0e80b02caa415,It's a small matter. But it gets at a bigger point.,2016-11-06,Kellyanne Conway said Donald Trump opposed the bank bailout. He supported it.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"During an appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday, Donald Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, was asked to name a single policy her candidate would pursue over the opposition of executives at the firm Goldman Sachs.The gist was to call into question the closing argument the Trump camp has made: Mainly, that he is a menace to the global elite and, in particular, the well-heeled financial interests of the country.Conway noted that Trump is critical of trade deals that banks like Goldman Sachs ostensibly support. But then she added a twist. Trump, she proclaimed, opposed the 2008 bank bailout, known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program.“I think more to the point, when you go back and look at TARP, which we got from a Republican president and continued by a Democratic president, Donald Trump would not be for that. And that benefits all these big banks who didn’t need the help. in some cases were forced to take the money,” she told host Jake Tapper.This is not true. In fact, Trump is on record backing TARP at the time it was being considered. It wasn’t full-throated. But it was supportive. Here is his statement from a Sept. 30, 2008, interview with CNN:“Nobody really knows what impact it’s going to have. Maybe it works, and maybe it doesn’t. But certainly it is worth a shot. I don’t love the idea that the government’s buying back all the bad loans. How about some of the good loans? You know? I don’t like the idea that the government, frankly, is going to be negotiating with people to sell those loans, because maybe we’d be better off having the best bankers in the world do that.One month after President Barack Obama took office, Trump was more effusive in praising TARP.“The one thing is, the government came in and intelligently put money into the banks, so that if you have your money in CDs or whatever in the banks, you’re not going to lose your money at least,” he said.And then, months later, he went even further, suggesting that bank nationalization may be a good option.“I do agree with what they’re doing with the banks. Whether they fund them or nationalize them, it doesn’t matter, but you have to keep the banks going,” Trump said.Now, Goldman Sachs would not have supported bank nationalization. And it’s unclear if Trump was just riffing there or really expressing a preference for the government seizing ownership. What is clear, regardless, is that he went from being softly supportive of the TARP to openly complimentary. Conway’s insistence otherwise is bunk. Of course, no one is going to blink twice over the Trump campaign being misleading about his position on TARP. Lies far bigger than this have been told, by both campaigns. But this nugget is illustrative of a larger trend that has defined the GOP nominee. On matters big and small, he has projected and lived in a post-truth world. And just two days before the election ends, he’s not about to stop.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

What does your husband think? Who’s taking care of the kids? Do you really think you could understand the federal budget?’” Thirty years later, EMILY’s List has helped elect 19 Democratic women to the Senate and 110 to the House of Representatives, 11 female governors, and more than 700 women to state and local offices. It’s raised more than $400 million to train “pro-choice” Democratic women to run for office. And, by electing hundreds of competent and successful female leaders, the group slowly warmed American voters to the idea that a woman can run the whole country. Now, as the founding vision of Malcolm’s group is so close to being realized, the emotions are difficult for her to process. Tuesday could mark the culmination of a goal three decades in the making, or a crushing, emotionally wrenching defeat. “I’m at this stage where I don’t want to read any more news. I can’t stand it,” Malcolm said. “But on the other hand, I can’t not read it. I’m just so excited at the prospect of Hillary winning. It’s overwhelming.”Two days before the presidential election, the race is much closer than Hillary Clinton’s supporters would have hoped ― especially considering that her opponent is a reality TV star who has bragged about grabbing women “by the pussy.” Part of what is hampering Clinton is the announcement from FBI Director James Comey ― less than two weeks before Election Day ― that he was investigating a newly discovered batch of emails that may or may not be pertinent to the private server Clinton used as secretary of state. But, for Malcolm and others who helped elect women to office, other factors seem to be at play. Clinton is graded on a curve, forced to weather many of the same sexist criticisms that have plagued female candidates for decades: that she doesn’t smile enough; that she’s untrustworthy and unlikeable; that she lacks the “strength” and “stamina” to be president. Feminist political operatives expected that these hurdles would have to be cleared; the road to putting a woman in the White House has been long and arduous. When EMILY’s List helped elect Barbara Mikulski (Md.) to the Senate in 1986, she was the first Democratic woman that had ever held a Senate seat not previously occupied by her husband. Women have always been more hesitant than men to run for office, not only because of lingering sexism in the public sphere, but because of the financial barriers to running a successful campaign. It takes a lot of money to win a seat in Congress, and women are less confident about their ability to fundraise than men.That’s where EMILY’s List comes in. The group holds recruiting sessions in states across the country to motivate and train women to run for office, and then it pours early money into their campaigns. In 1988, women made up only 5 percent of Congress; now, thanks in large part to EMILY’s List, they make up nearly 20 percent. And the group has built up a pipeline of women in state and local offices from which it can pull seasoned candidates into bigger House, Senate and now presidential races.But despite women’s gains in politics, some of the old challenges remain. When Clinton ran for president in 2008, entire news articles were written about her cleavage. And even now, the negativity around her candidacy has the potential to ruin an enormous milestone in women’s history. Stephanie Schriock, president of EMILY’s List, recognizes Clinton’s struggles to excite some voters. But she believes women are just afraid to fully feel their emotions about this historic moment until after Clinton actually wins. “There is an emotion that’s pent up, and I do believe that on Tuesday night, if we do what we need to do and get voters out and elect Hillary president, there is going to be an emotional release by women across this country that is going to be extraordinary,” she said. “Even I feel it. I feel like I can’t have an emotion yet ― I gotta keep it contained until we get this done. We haven’t given women permission to feel this moment, and we’ve got to do that.” Even if Clinton does win, the celebrations among those who work to elect women to office may be short-lived. Among officials in this community, there is a widely shared concern that a Clinton victory will be downgraded in its significance; that critics will insist Donald Trump’s shortcomings were solely to credit for her win.For the women who have worked for decades to prepare the public for a female president, this would undervalue not just the historical significance of a Clinton win but the challenges she faced.“We’ve spent 30 years seeding this ground, helping it become an environment where voters were going to be OK with voting for a woman,” Schriock said. “And we’re really, really proud of the campaign she has run. She’s put out an incredibly strong vision for this country, centered on economic opportunities for women and families.” As it stands on the doorstep of helping elect the country’s first female president, EMILY’s List has ramped up its political operations. In October, the group partnered with the progressive PAC Priorities USA on a $20 million digital ad blitz targeting millennial women. And Malcolm, 69, is personally phone banking for Clinton in the final days of the election. “That’s the culture of EMILY’s List,” she said. “If the bathroom of the campaign office needs to be cleaned, we’ll clean the bathroom. Whatever it takes.” Schriock said the energy she’s seeing on the ground for Clinton in swing states like New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and North Carolina have her confident that Clinton is going to eke out a victory. She is preparing for her own emotional release at the EMILY’s List watch party Tuesday night.“We’re gonna have lots of Kleenex,” she said."

20,POLITICS,Latest FBI News Doesn't Stop Republicans From Attacking Clinton On Emails,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-clinton-emails_us_581f9e77e4b0d9ce6fbcc2e6,But it did seem to sour some of them on James Comey.,2016-11-06,"The FBI announced Sunday that Clinton won't face any charges relating to her emails, a decision that comes just days before Tuesday's election.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/581fab75150000d804532064.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When FBI Director James Comey announced Sunday that the agency is still not planning to pursue charges against Hillary Clinton, top Republicans took the news mostly as a fresh opportunity to criticize the Democratic nominee.“Regardless of this decision, the undisputed finding of the FBI’s investigation is that Secretary Clinton put our nation’s secrets at risk and in doing so compromised our national security,” House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said in a statement released Sunday, urging Americans to vote for Donald Trump and “ensure Secretary Clinton never gets her hands on classified information again.”Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus took a similar tack, issuing a statement that similarly elided the lack of any new developments in the investigation. “The FBI’s findings from its criminal investigation of Hillary Clinton’s secret email server were a damning and unprecedented indictment of her judgment,” he said. “The FBI found evidence Clinton broke the law, that she placed highly classified national security information at risk and repeatedly lied to the American people about her reckless conduct.”Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, argued Sunday on MSNBC that the latest development was neither good nor bad news for the Trump campaign.“Some things haven’t changed at all,” she said. “What FBI Director Comey said on July 7 under oath to Congress is still the same: that she was reckless and careless in her handling of information. ... The reason that so many Americans have a problem with Hillary Clinton’s honesty and trustworthiness and veracity does not change.”The latest development did, however, seem to abruptly shift Conway’s views of the FBI director.“He’s mishandled the investigation from the beginning, and this proves it yet again” Conway told MSNBC’s Steve Kornacki, questioning whether the FBI had actually gone through all of the emails in question.That skepticism marks a distinct change from less than two weeks ago, when Conway slammed Democrats for criticizing the FBI director. “Astonished by the all-out assault on Comey by Team Clinton,” she wrote in a tweet on Oct. 29. “Suggesting he is a partisan interfering with the election is dangerous & unfair.”"
21,POLITICS,Most Voters Don't Change Their Minds In The Final Week Of A Campaign,Natalie Jackson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/election-poll-trump-clinton_us_581e6475e4b0aac62484e56a,Poll numbers may swing -- but that doesn't mean people's preferences really do.,2016-11-06,Donald Trump supporters aren't likely to change their minds about their candidate this late in the game. And neither are Hillary Clinton backers.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/581e66921600002e002c89f3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In the final days of the presidential campaign, we’ve all become very good at forgetting the lessons we learned earlier in the election cycle. “Anything could happen” seems to be the common refrain ― including from Hillary Clinton’s campaign, which is regularly sending fundraising emails with that theme.The Clinton campaign needs to do that in order to keep excitement up, generate donations and convey the urgency of getting out the vote. But number-crunchers need to look at the numbers and what we really know about election polling.What we know is this: Public opinion doesn’t swing wildly in the final days before a presidential election without some huge crisis. The FBI’s mishandled email issues certainly aren’t big enough, especially since Clinton’s email woes are nothing new. And previous “October surprises” haven’t moved the mark much, either.While voter preferences don’t move back and forth like a pendulum at the end of a campaign, polling numbers do. There are lots of reasons for that, some of which we don’t even completely understand.Polls have many sources of error. They leak in at every point in the survey process ― including how the survey is done; the sample selection; who answers the poll; how the questions are worded; and even how the data are treated after the poll is completed.But the source of error that’s most pertinent to this week’s debates is a phenomenon called “differential nonresponse.” In the context of election polls, that means when things are going badly for one candidate, their supporters are less likely to answer a poll than when things are going well. So polls that don’t control for changes in who responds will swing based on events ― not because anyone changed their mind, but because people stopped responding to pollsters for a few days.  YouGov documented the partisan differential nonresponse patterns that resulted from the latest FBI email dust-up. The news made very little difference to the poll’s overall bottom line, but the pattern of fewer Democrats responding in the initial period after the scandal is apparent.There’s no evidence that anyone’s mind changed or that anyone’s likelihood of voting changed ― instead, they just didn’t answer the poll.So given all this instability in polls, the inevitable question is how I’m so certain reality favors Clinton and not Donald Trump. That’s fairly simple: If this were a truly competitive race, there would be more national polls showing Trump ahead. The Electoral College will decide the election at the state level, of course, but the national polls provide a decent indicator of the trends.These trends indicate that Trump has closed the race slightly, yes, but ― and I can’t emphasize this enough ― there are no polls showing Trump leading nationally. At least none that meet HuffPost Pollster’s transparency criteria to make it into our charts (which most polls do). Plus, large tracking polls and panels show relatively little movement in voters’ opinions over time. And in states like Florida and North Carolina that Trump would have to win, Clinton is up in the vast majority of the polls.All this is to say that when we average the polls out, there’s not a lot of movement around a solid Clinton advantage. And there hasn’t been all year. If there were a substantial risk of Trump actually being ahead, there would be more polls showing him leading."

The occasion marked 30 years since the late jurist announced his first-ever opinion for the court.“He made our days warmer, livelier and happier,” Roberts said near the end of the brief hearing, his voice trembling. “He sang loudest and best at our traditional birthday celebrations. He raised his glass highest to toast others’ happy occasions and his rich laughter filled our halls and our hearts.”With days before the election, Roberts didn’t call the session to send a message about the problems of having an eight-member court and an empty seat. Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama’s choice to fill it, was even in attendance and sat directly in front of the justices, perhaps wondering if he’ll ever get to call them colleagues.Instead, the Supreme Court was hewing close to its traditions, convening to accept a resolution honoring Scalia passed by the members of the Supreme Court bar ― who at an earlier meeting had approved it unanimously and for posterity.And it was up to Attorney General Loretta Lynch, the country’s top lawyer, to move the resolution into the public record. In due time, the proceedings will go down in history in a bound volume known as the U.S. Reports ― together with every decision the court issued at that point in time, now the law of the United States. “Mr. Chief Justice, on behalf of the lawyers of this nation, and in particular, the members of this court’s bar, I respectfully request that the resolutions presented to you in honor of Antonin Scalia be accepted by the court and that they, together with the chronicle of these proceedings, be ordered kept for all time in the records of this court,” Lynch, an Obama appointee, said during the rare appearance.At a time when the high court has been politicized by a Republican-controlled Senate, which has threatened to leave it short-staffed if Americans choose a Democrat as their next president, the session demonstrated that the court, for all its flaws, still knows how to rise above partisanship.

The occasion marked 30 years since the late jurist announced his first-ever opinion for the court.“He made our days warmer, livelier and happier,” Roberts said near the end of the brief hearing, his voice trembling. “He sang loudest and best at our traditional birthday celebrations. He raised his glass highest to toast others’ happy occasions and his rich laughter filled our halls and our hearts.”With days before the election, Roberts didn’t call the session to send a message about the problems of having an eight-member court and an empty seat. Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama’s choice to fill it, was even in attendance and sat directly in front of the justices, perhaps wondering if he’ll ever get to call them colleagues.Instead, the Supreme Court was hewing close to its traditions, convening to accept a resolution honoring Scalia passed by the members of the Supreme Court bar ― who at an earlier meeting had approved it unanimously and for posterity.And it was up to Attorney General Loretta Lynch, the country’s top lawyer, to move the resolution into the public record. In due time, the proceedings will go down in history in a bound volume known as the U.S. Reports ― together with every decision the court issued at that point in time, now the law of the United States. “Mr. Chief Justice, on behalf of the lawyers of this nation, and in particular, the members of this court’s bar, I respectfully request that the resolutions presented to you in honor of Antonin Scalia be accepted by the court and that they, together with the chronicle of these proceedings, be ordered kept for all time in the records of this court,” Lynch, an Obama appointee, said during the rare appearance.At a time when the high court has been politicized by a Republican-controlled Senate, which has threatened to leave it short-staffed if Americans choose a Democrat as their next president, the session demonstrated that the court, for all its flaws, still knows how to rise above partisanship.

Soon afterwards, it said that the operation, called Euphrates Anger, had begun.“The general command of the Syria Democratic Forces announces the blessed start of its major military campaign to liberate the city of Raqqa,” Jehan Sheikh Amad, an SDF spokeswoman, told a news conference in the Syrian town of Ain Issa.The SDF called on Raqqa’s civilians to avoid areas where Islamic State militants are present and to go to “liberated territory.”An attack on Raqqa has been long expected, with U.S. Defence Secretary Ash Carter saying on Oct. 25 that the battle to retake it would “overlap” with the assault on Mosul.The top U.S. military commander in Iraq, Army Lieutenant General Stephen Townsend, said last month that the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State wanted to move urgently to isolate Raqqa because of concerns about the group using the city as a base to plan and launch attacks against targets abroad.France has also pushed for simultaneous action on both fronts. President Francois Hollande said last month there was evidence that Islamic State fighters were fleeing to Raqqa, and that everything must be done to stop them regrouping there.French Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Sunday that an offensive on Raqqa should be launched while the battle to push the group out of Mosul is under way.“We have to go to Raqqa ... it will automatically be local forces that will liberate Raqqa even if French forces, U.S. forces, the coalition contribute with air strikes to dismantle Daesh,” Le Drian told Europe 1 radio, using an Arabic acronym for Islamic State.“Mosul-Raqqa can’t be disassociated because Islamic State and the territories it occupies span that area,” he said.Since it was formed in early 2015, the SDF has seized large swathes of territory along the Syria-Turkey border from Islamic State and pushed the jihadist group back to within 30 km (18 miles) of Raqqa."

The local operation command, a joint military and police unit, said the vehicle used in Samarra was also an ambulance.Authorities in both cities declared curfews, fearing possible further attacks.Amaq said two suicide bombers struck in Samarra, the first detonating a car bomb and the second activating an explosives vest among a group of people who survived the first blast. It said the Tikrit attack was carried out by a single car bomber.Iraqi troops and security forces, backed by a U.S.-led international coalition, are battling Islamic State in the northern city of Mosul.

On Friday night, long lines at polling stations in Clark County, Nevada, stunned local observers as dramatic images of the scenes ricocheted across the internet.And yet, the next evening, the state’s GOP chairman delivered what would normally be deemed a dog whistle if it hadn’t been so loud. “Last night, in Clark County, they kept a poll open till 10 o’clock at night so a certain group could vote,” Chairman Michael McDonald said at a rally for GOP nominee Donald Trump Saturday in Reno. “It wasn’t in an area that normally has high transition. The polls are supposed to close at 7. This was kept open till 10. Yeah, you feel free right now? Think this is a free or easy election?”For a party in a state with a growing Hispanic population to describe that population as a “certain group” seems like an odd decision. But then, step back and think about the bigger picture: The chairman of a state party was complaining that election officials were being too flexible in allowing people to vote.Speaking later, Trump likewise criticized the decision by election officials to keep polling locations open.“Folks, it’s a rigged system,” he told the crowd, which responded with of cheers. “And we’re going to beat it.

For all Americans.""</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/581fa9711500001300532060.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For many millennials, myself included, this presidential election is one of the first we can finally embrace our civic duty and vote. And yet, for many young people, 2016 is not filled with optimism for the future of our country, but rather, fear of erasing the progress society has made in the last eight years. Since President Obama took office, he has has reformed Wall Street, ensured a greener future for the United States, and embraced marriage equality.On November 8th, young people are faced with a choice. On the surface, the choice is between someone who, for all intents and purposes, is the face of the political elite and the status quo, and the supposedly only candidate with the ability to switch things up in Washington. While a superficial look at the election draws parallels to 2008, this year is direr.For the first time in modern history, the United States has a candidate who has openly disregarded the first amendment by promoting violence against political opponents. The same candidate has also sought to undermine religious freedom in the United States by proposing a ban on Muslims immigrating to the country. Donald Trump has promised to appoint Justices who will overturn marriage equality and destroy the monumental progress we made on June 26th, 2015. In comparison, Hillary Clinton has promised to be a President for every American, regardless of their support for her. She has been an avid supporter of welcoming refugees, and a longtime proponent of LGBT rights.This election is about more than the next four years and preserving the progress of the last four. This year, we are deciding the direction of this country for at least a generation. Currently, three of the eight Justices on the Supreme Court are older than 77. To put that into perspective, the average retirement for Supreme Court Justices since 1971 has been 78.7 years old. Combined with the currently vacant seat, this means the next President will likely appoint four Justices to the Supreme Court. Since 2010, landmark cases such as Citizens United and Obergefell v. Hodges have been decided in 5-4 decisions.In 1954 under the Warren court, Brown v. Board of Education desegregated public schools throughout the United States. President Eisenhower enforced the ruling despite never offering public support to neither Brown, nor to the civil rights movement underway. However, the Justice Department under his watch filed an amicus brief on the case on Brown’s behalf asking the court to rule in favor of school desegregation. President Eisenhower’s appointment of Chief Justice Earl Warren was strategic: he sought steer the court towards desegregation and lay the foundation for the vast expansion of civil rights in the 1950’s and the 1960’s.For many college students and recent graduates, the most important issues the Supreme Court could decide upon are women’s health rights, LGBT equality, and Citizens United. In fact, almost 70% of people aged 18-29 support the availability and legality of a woman’s right to choose. In the final presidential debate of the year, Hillary Clinton said “We need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of women’s rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to Citizens United, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system.” As her statement implies, Secretary Clinton offers a stark difference in values than Donald Trump who has repeatedly upheld the late Justice Antonin Scalia as the ""ultimate example"" of what he is looking for. Scalia, who passed away early this year, left behind a legacy of denying LGBT rights, undermining campaign-finance regulation, and limiting the rights of minorities and women. Under no circumstances is he a justice millennials want to exemplify. By appointing someone to the Court with similar values as Scalia, Mr. Trump alienates over half the population and relegates anyone who isn’t a heteronormative, white male as a second-class citizen. In the last eight years, the United States has upheld its reputation as one of the most diverse, accepting, and open societies the world has ever seen. As a generation who supports gay marriage, women’s health care rights, immigration, and tackling economic inequality, the only choice for president on November 8th is Secretary Hillary Clinton. No other candidate offers the impressive level of achievement and guarantee to uphold America’s awesome progressiveness. "

Just a couple of days remaining from an intense election with the looming threat of Donald Trump, thanks to the projected Latina/o vote, my prediction will come to fruition.According to POLITICO (11/06/2016), Latinas/os are giving Clinton the boost that she desperately needs in critical states like Nevada, Colorado and Florida. Moreover, according to Latino Decisions (11/06/2016), a national tracking poll indicates a historic Latina/o voter turnout for this critical election, ranging from 13.1 million and 14.7 million. This includes key states like Arizona, Texas and others with large Latina/o populations.However, just because I predicted a Clinton victory in early 2014, it doesn’t mean that I endorse her past and current policies (e.g., immigration enforcement, free trade agreements, military interventions, etc.). Speaking of military interventions, while Trump represents a deplorable hustler and bully who aims to torture terrorists (apart from killing their families), Clinton is “palling around” with war criminals like former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.Moreover, Clinton has remained mum about President Barack Obama’s mass deportations of over 2.5 million undocumented immigrants. Ironically, many of the remaining family members and friends of these deported immigrations will ensure Clinton’s victory.In short, once Clinton prevails on November 8, 2016, let this presidential election be a lesson for Republican leaders: “Mess with Latinas/os at your own peril!”"

I knew that the polls on Brexit were running close, but I also knew that the bookies had never wavered in their conviction that we would remain in Europe. Also, I knew that the very worst of the Leave campaign had now come out so clearly that nobody could miss it. Just the previous week, they had produced a poster so close to Nazi propaganda that it was reported as hate speech. Later that same day, MP Jo Cox was murdered in the street for her pro-European views. Surely, I thought such naked xenophobia and violence would be the death of the Leave vote.At 5.30 the next morning, I stared at the computer in shock and horror. Leave had won. And despite all the other reasons that many Leave voters cited—chief among them the lie that the National Health Service would receive 350 million pounds more each week—this was presented as a massive victory for racism and xenophobia. And it rapidly became so. Racist hate crimes rose 49 percent immediately following the vote. After a brief period of chaos, the Prime Minster became Theresa May, widely viewed as a sensible pragmatist (and previously an opponent of Brexit). But this “sensible pragmatist” took the lesson of the vote to be a simple, xenophobic one. Within an eye blink, we began to learn that because “the people have spoken” even foreign doctors would no longer be welcome here to save British lives. And soon we learned both that the government was no longer willing to receive advice from the non-British, and that people with dual citizenship no longer counted as truly British. People like me.Xenophobia feels different when it’s directed at you. I have always been enraged on behalf of its targets, but during my time here I have only rarely been one. Protected by class privilege, white skin, and American nationality, I have sometimes been privy to anti-immigrant rants. But when I point out (in my American accent) that I’m an immigrant the invariable response is “I don’t mean you.” But now things have changed—now they (at least the government) do mean me. I know that I still have all the protections of class privilege and white skin, and that things are very easy for me compared to other foreigners. And my foreignness is not apparent until I speak. Knowing how painful it feels anyway, I am in awe of the bravery of dark-skinned women who go out in hijabs, into this world of anti-Muslim hatred. I genuinely don’t know how they do it.And now we face another momentous, vertiginously terrifying vote next week. Yes, Clinton has been very much ahead for some time. But now, thanks to the bizarre intervention of James Comey, it seems likely that Trump is gaining—and it is difficult to measure these gains, with so little time left. I know that on November 8, I will not sleep. I may not be able to form coherent sentences. Again I think of how much harder that night will be to get through for others: for people whose skin colour or religious clothing marks them as a target wherever they go; for the millions who fear deportation for themselves or their loved ones; and for all the victims of sexual violence who cannot believe that a man who boasts of assault may soon hold the presidency. And also for the rest of the world, unable to do anything but watch in fear as they wonder if the nuclear button will soon be in the hands of someone who has already amply demonstrated his poor judgment, lack of restraint, and hair-trigger temper.If Trump wins—and even if he comes close—we can be certain that this will be viewed as a victory for racism. Already the Ku Klux Klan is triumphantly touting his campaign’s successes as showing the popularity of their world view. And we can also be certain that this will help to increasingly legitimate horrific behaviours that are currently still widely condemned.To see why, consider what psychologists have learned about littering. Most of us have been thoroughly taught that littering is bad, but of course there’s some human inclination to take the easy way out and simply drop that piece of paper you find shoved under your windshield wipers. Yet, in general, you probably overcome it. It turns out, though, that if you are in a parking garage which already has a lot of litter, you’re much more likely to give in to that tendency. Humans tend to comply to norms, and learning that a lot of other people are behaving in some way—even one you’ve been taught is wrong—makes you more likely to behave in that way.Sadly, we have reason to suppose that racism works this way too. Although we’ve nearly all been taught that racism is bad, we nearly all do have racist tendencies (even if only unconscious ones), just from growing up in a society structured by racism. As we see more people around us behaving in racist ways, the force of those anti-racist norms weakens. This is why, psychologists have suggested, hearing racist humour makes people more tolerant of discrimination. We saw this in Brexit, and we’ve seen it already in the racially motivated violence and abuse both at Trump rallies and in Trump’s name.Philosophers Rae Langton and Mary Kate McGowan have argued that racist utterances matter because they have the potential to change our standards of acceptable behavior. This, they say, is why it is so vital to object, and to do so forcefully. The research described above backs this up: people adapt themselves to the behavior they see around them—not just to what they’ve been taught is right. When an election becomes in effect a referendum on xenophobia or racism—as Brexit was, and as the US election is—we are at a moment of immense consequence. We can have either one of the most powerful endorsements of racism, or one of its most powerful repudiations. This choice has sadly already been made in the UK. In the US it is still before us."

They lure victims in Internet chats and forums, post online recruitment and classified advertisements, and use sophisticated anonymity software to cloak their identities. Victims are men, women, children, transgender, and non-conforming individuals who are trafficked for sex and forced labor. They are foreign nationals and United States citizens/residents. There are numerous human trafficking definitions, but the Palermo Protocol is the worldwide standard. The protocol—also known as the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress, and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children—supplements the 2000 United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and has been ratified by 167 nations, including the United States. It contains three elements: the act of trafficking, the means of trafficking, and the purpose of trafficking. The act of trafficking is the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, or receipt of persons. The means of trafficking is the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or vulnerability, or giving payments or benefits to a person in control of the victim. The purpose of trafficking is exploitation. This includes, at a minimum, sexual exploitation, including the exploitation of the prostitution of others, forced labor or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude, or the removal of organs. Exact numbers are challenging, but a quick glance at the International Organization for Migration (IOM), which has the largest victim assistance caseload, assisted nearly 7,000 human trafficking victims in 115 nations during 2015. The vast majority of victims—74 percent—were trafficked for forced labor or services and more than half—55.3 percent—were male.As Internet use becomes increasingly commonplace worldwide, so too does its use for recruitment. In Poland, the anti-trafficking non-governmental organization (NGO) La Strada found that even nearly a decade ago 90 percent of Poles who found jobs abroad did so through the Internet. The NGO estimated that 30 percent of trafficking victims it served were recruited this way.[1] Technology isn’t just used in monitoring and recruitment but also to sell the sexual services of trafficking victims. This is primarily done through online classified websites. The site most used for doing so—at least since Craigslist closed its adult services section in 2010—is the classified ad website, Backpage.com.Yiota G. Souras, senior vice president and general counsel at the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, testified before the United States Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations that more than 71 percent of suspected child trafficking reports submitted by the public to the CyberTipline involve Backpage.com. (This does not include reports Backpage.com makes to the CyberTipline.) In March, the U.S. Senate unanimously voted to hold Backpage.com in civil contempt of Congress. The site, says the Senate, did not comply with a subpoena that required Backpage.com to provide, among other evidence, documents on its procedures for moderating and reviewing advertisements, metadata, and document retention. The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations reported it found evidence that the site sometimes edits classified ad content before publication, such as deleting words and images. This likely served, said the committee, “to remove evidence of the illegality of the underlying transaction”. In October, authorities raided Backpage.com’s Dallas headquarters and arrested its CEO, Carl Ferrer, under pimping a minor and conspiracy charges.In order to combat the use of classified advertisements, online recruitment/job postings, forums, and chats that facilitate modern slavery, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), an agency of the U.S. Department of Defense, has developed a sophisticated search engine called DIG (Domain-specific Insight Graphs) Memex. Unlike Google or Bing, DIG Memex plunges into Deep Web depths; web areas not indexed by conventional search engines. It can search all online sex ads (there are more than 60 million), instantaneously extracting and linking hidden information on online illicit activity, and disclose trafficking network names and numbers. In order to accomplish this, DIG Memex searches various networks, including Tor, software that gives users web anonymity through onion routing and was created by the Naval Research Laboratory. Interestingly, DARPA actually contributes financially to Tor and several Tor Project developers are working on DIG Memex. The search engine also digs through Freenet, which allows users to anonymously share files, chat on forums, and use in darknet mode; and I2P, which creates an anonymous network within a network.Manhattan is one of the first cities to deploy DIG Memex, which already has a database packed with tens of millions web pages and grows by 5,000 pages per hour. The curated counter trafficking domain index includes sex trafficking and forced labor, but initially focused on the former. In fact, this seems to be an issue across the board when it comes to combating human trafficking. It appears the technology world hasn’t yet figured out how to best hone in on labor indicators. The small business IST Research, which works on Memex, is trying to figure it out. Using its Pulse information sharing and analysis platform, IST Research is monitoring the supply chain, collating passive Internet data on the Deep Web to find unscrupulous recruitment networks, and determining the best communication method to reach victims and produce active engagement.The concept of using technology to combat criminal activity has existed, well, as long as the proliferation of technology. The telephone, two-way radio, and automobile, changed the law enforcement landscape in the twentieth century. Today, the Internet, text messaging, voicemail, social media networking, and email are continuing to change the law enforcement and advocacy topography. The challenge, of course, is that with ample funds and ready access to new technologies, traffickers are often steps ahead. In 2012, President Obama implored all techies to join the fight against human trafficking.…We’re turning the tables on the traffickers. Just as they are now using technology and the Internet to exploit their victims, we’re going to harness technology to stop them. We’re encouraging tech companies and advocates and law enforcement—and we’re also challenging college students—to develop tools that our young people can use to stay safe online and on their smart phones.Many private technology companies are already on board—applying their expertise and funds to disrupt and combat human trafficking. For example, in 2011, Google gave $11.5 million in grants to support anti-trafficking technology initiatives, including those driven by NGOs and non-profit organizations such as International Justice Mission, Slavery Footprint, and Polaris Project. The latter organization has partnered with Silicon Valley companies Palantir, Salesforce, Twilio, and Thorn: Digital Defenders of Children—founded by Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher, in order to disrupt traffickers and identify victims. Polaris launched the NHTRC crisis and tip reporting hotline in 2007 with specialists that can answer calls in more than 200 languages. The 24 hours a day, 7 days a week hotline received, and receives, roughly 100 calls a day from a variety of callers such as victims and survivors, concerned friends and family members, worried neighbors, and organizations wanting to know how best to serve their human trafficking survivor population. Since its inception, the multimodal hotline has received 107,982 phone calls, 6,550 web form contacts, and 7,667 emails that resulted in the identification of 25,791 human trafficking cases.Partnerships between Silicon Valley and Polaris have resulted in a multitude of strides in the anti-trafficking effort. Thanks to these relationships, NHTRC hosts BeFree, a textline, where victims can simply text BeFree (233733) in order to reach a specialist. This is critical because it may be less risky for a victim (depending on his/her particular trafficking situation) to send a text message than make a phone call. The result has been a significant uptick in victims contacting the NHTRC. BeFree launched on March 28, 2013 and, so far, has had roughly 3,617 text conversations that led to 424 human trafficking cases. A larger percentage of victims reach out to NHTRC through text than by phone call, 23 percent compared to 11 percent, respectively.The NHTRC also has an easy-to-use dashboard at their fingertips that lets them quickly locate the most proximate resources for victims, access 150 data variables, and triage information to law enforcement. All data is collected through the sophisticated Silicon Valley Salesforce software system Freedom Force, which syncs nightly with Palantir data analysis software that examines aggregated data and uncovers human trafficking trends. The analysis platform maps trafficking cases, trafficking networks, and can even identify a travel route traffickers are using. Not only does this allow NHTRC to immediately connect victims to resources, it also gives Polaris critical insights to pass along to law enforcement and policymakers, helping to address the issue on multiple levels.Tech-driven anti-trafficking groups are constantly amending their approach to include the newest influx of popular technology. Historically, traffickers have been dozens of steps ahead, if not more. The partnerships between Silicon Valley and NGOs, have, thankfully, begun narrowing the gap.This is an excerpt from the article Technology and Human Trafficking.

36,POLITICS,"Romney, Rubio And Many Others Have Called Trump A 'Con Man,' But Millions Of Voters Are Nonetheless Lining Up Behind Trump","Steven Greenhouse, ContributorWriter, freelancer, retired New York Times labor and workplace...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/romney-rubio-and-many-others-have-called-trump-a-con_us_581f49e7e4b01022624118f7,Trump is in a league of his own in terms of telling falsehoods and lies.,2016-11-06,"November 05: Donald Trump at the Stadium Arena at the National Western Stock Show complex during his rally November 05, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/581f53681600002f002c8aec.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Mitt Romney called Donald Trump a “con man,” and so did Marco Rubio and Michael Bloomberg.For the news media, the fact that Trump is widely seen as a con man, even by many in his own party, has created thorny problems regarding how to cover him. The mainstream news media (aside from Fox News) generally endeavors to be fair and balanced in covering elections – but what does “fair and balanced” mean when covering a con man?In aspiring for balance, does that mean news organizations should do as many pieces criticizing a con man candidate as criticizing his or her opponent? But wouldn’t the news media then be delinquent ― and unfair to the non-con candidate ― if they do just as many negative articles about a con man candidate like Trump as negative articles about a more conventional candidate, like Hillary Clinton, who also has problems with the truth.Many news organizations have concluded that the fair and balanced way to cover Trump and Clinton is to be equally aggressive toward them when that is warranted. In other words, be critical and aggressive toward Trump or Clinton whenever they are found to tell falsehoods, cheat, cut corners or otherwise do wrong.Trump is in a league of his own in terms of telling falsehoods and lies, and that’s one reason the news media have often been tougher on him. Fact checkers have found Trump to be the most dishonest major party candidate they’ve ever encountered. The Washington Post’s Fact Checker has given a Four Pinocchio rating to an astonishing 63 percent of the 91 Trump statements it has examined – a Four Pinocchio rating means a statements was totally false. In contrast, 14 percent of Clinton’s statements received Four Pinocchios – a typical candidate gets Four Pinocchios 10 to 20 percent of the time. (I have no patience for Rush Limbaugh and others who repeatedly attack fact checkers as biased and not to be trusted. Limbaugh and his ilk attack fair-minded fact-checking referees for a simple, strategic reason: to delegitimize them in order to make it easier for the candidates they support to continue spewing their falsehoods.)Mitt Romney and many others agree that Trump is the greatest con man ever nominated by a major party. Indeed, Trump has been compared to some of the great demagogues of history, like Senator Joseph McCarthy, who spectacularly and falsely stated that a horde of Communists worked in the federal government, and Governor Huey Long, who charmed voters with pie-in-the-sky, share-the-wealth promises that he’d deliver impossible-to-deliver levels of prosperity.So why do Romney and others call Trump a con man? Trump has boasted that he knows more about ISIS than the generals. He promised that he’d release his tax returns if he ran for president, but he still hasn’t released them. He has repeatedly insisted he can’t release his returns because they’re under audit, but audits in no way preclude him or anyone else from releasing their returns. Trump demonizes trade with China and Mexico, but, whoops, his Trump-brand suits, shirts and ties are made overseas. Trump openly mocked a New York Times reporter with a disability, then denied ever doing so. He asserted that thousands of Muslims celebrated the 9/11 attacks on rooftops in New Jersey, but he has failed to provide a scintilla of evidence to buttress that false claim.Trump has repeatedly said that America’s murder rate is the highest ever and that America’s taxes are the highest in the world, even though fact-checkers have repeatedly debunked those claims. Trump says that no one respects women more than he does, even though he has savagely mocked women for their looks, has acknowledged barging into the dressing rooms of teenage beauty contestants and has boasted of grabbing women by the pussy. Trump denounces illegal immigrants, yet he hired undocumented workers to do demolition work for Trump Tower. Trump initially proposed nearly $10 trillion in tax cuts over a decade along as well as a vast increase in military spending – all while absurdly promising he would balance the federal budget.Long after Barack Obama produced his birth certificate, Trump continued to maintain that Obama was an alien born overseas. Trump asserts that Mexico will pay for his “beautiful wall” between the two countries—something that proud, Yanqui-resenting Mexico wouldn’t agree to in a million years. This past Friday Trump said the economy is “an absolute disaster” even though the jobless rate has dropped to 4.9 percent, the nation has added 15 million jobs since 2010 and the 5.2 percent jump in median household income last year was the highest on record. And then there’s Trump’s most dangerous con of all—he is undermining our precious democracy by asserting that the election is rigged, and that he might not accept the election results.The list of Trump’s falsehoods and cons goes on and on – there was that snake-oil operation known as Trump University or Trump, by one count, has flip-flopped 138 times on the issues. We journalists pay a lot of attention to whether a candidate lies a little or a lot because that says something fundamental about a candidate’s character. Journalists, like other Americans, much prefer when candidates tell the truth – it shows whether a candidate is leveling with, or seeking to fool, the American people.To be sure, Clinton, like most other politicians, has made mistakes and lied. It was politically unwise and all too cozy for her to speak to Goldman Sachs for $225,000 a speech. She originally hailed the Trans-Pacific Partnership as “the gold standard,” before flip-flopping and opposing it in the face of a tough challenge from Bernie Sanders. And it was very wrong of her to use a private server for her emails, but let’s not forget that many other officials have used private email addresses for government business, including many governors, senators and representatives as well as Colin Powell and Karl Rove and many other officials in the Bush/Cheney White House, even on some military matters. (So, why the many calls to jail Clinton over this, but not the many other officials who have done the same thing?)To me, a journalist who has written for the past 20 years about American workers, the biggest mystery in this election (as I wrote for Huffington Post last week) is why are millions of normally tough-minded working-class voters rallying behind Trump, even though he is so widely seen as a con man. To be sure, many people are tired of the Clintons and are angry with the status quo. Wages have, until recently, stagnated for years, Corporate America has moved millions of jobs overseas, and the cost of college has skyrocketed. People want these problems fixed, and now comes Mr. Trump, a brash, charismatic, tough-talking showman and change agent who promises to make yu-u-ge changes. He often even pledges to do the impossible: to wipe out ISIS in a jiffy and to bring back jobs from overseas, from China, Mexico and elsewhere, that are never coming back. Millions of Americans have been charmed by the tune of this pied piper ― even though Romney and other Republicans have warned voters about him.The greatest Republican of them all, Abraham Lincoln, cautioned us about con men, saying, “You can fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time.” Whether Trump wins or loses on Tuesday, I am sure that for years to come, political scientists are going to study and debate how did it come to pass that in the year 2016, tens of millions of Americans voted for someone who Mitt Romney, Michael Bloomberg and so many others warned is an obvious con man."

Bush. That the former president has not given any indication that he is inclined to do so is a great shame. Now, two days before Election Day, time is running out for him to do his part to help avert a national disaster.Last week, George P. Bush — nephew of George W., grandson of George H.W., and son of early Trump victim Jeb — was asked whether his presidential uncle and presidential grandfather might be Hillary Clinton voters. He answered: “Potentially. But hard to speculate.” George P., an ambitious young Texas politician and the only Bush backing Trump, later clarified: “I don’t know how they voted. I’m speculating, to be honest.”We don’t, however, need to speculate about how the two former President Bushes feel about their party’s presidential nominee. Both were no-shows at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland and have declined to endorse Trump.And it’s not just their omissions that are telling.In August, the younger President Bush, speaking at a private political fundraiser, decried policies of “isolationism, nativism, and protectionism.” He didn’t mention Trump by name, but it was clear whom he was talking about.Then in September, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, daughter of the late Robert F. Kennedy, caused a small stir when she posted on her Facebook page that the elder President Bush had told her he would be voting for Clinton. In response, the former president’s spokesman said that his boss is a “private citizen” casting a “private vote” and “is not commenting on the presidential race.”Indeed, both former President Bushes have maintained an official policy of silence on the Clinton-Trump contest.It’s time for them to break their silence, for America’s sake.Trump is closing in on Clinton in key battleground states. The unthinkable prospect of a Trump victory suddenly seems terrifyingly possible.Unfortunately, when it comes to delivering the needed blow that would dampen enthusiasm for Trump on the right, those who can won’t, and those who would can’t.Republican elected officials are reticent to stand up to Trump. Few have done so with much vigor. None of any consequence stand with the only person who can stop Trump: Hillary Clinton. No doubt Republican office-holders fear the wrath of their party’s base. But with what is at stake in this election, Republicans’ unwillingness to do the right thing is unforgivable.Meanwhile, the unprecedented threat that Trump presents to American democracy has led rock-ribbed Republican newspapers that never endorse Democrats to break with long partisan traditions. Numerous conservative pundits are sounding the alarm that a Trump presidency would endanger America’s constitutional order. But rank-and-file Republicans have been mostly deaf to the cries of newspaper editorialists and columnists.George W. Bush, though, could stand up to Trump and actually be heard by Republican voters.Imagine a news conference at the 11th hour of this dolorous election in which the former president announces that he is supporting Clinton. Yes, Bush would need to acknowledge that he and Clinton disagree greatly on a great many issues. But the significance of their deep disagreements pales in comparison to the profound danger that a Trump presidency poses to all that is good in America.To be sure, Trump would try to spin such a move as a last-ditch effort at self-preservation by a “corrupt political establishment.” And such a characterization would have some resonance.But a broadside from Bush would not be so easy for Trump to brush off. After a polarizing eight years in the White House, Bush has earned respect and affection with a dignified post-presidency. Last year, a CNN/ORC poll found that the younger President Bush was regarded favorably by 52 percent of Americans. He was particularly popular among demographics that are supporting Trump: 88 percent of Republicans and 73 percent of conservatives viewed Bush favorably.A decision to cross party lines by the former president, notwithstanding his differences with the Democratic nominee, would have real power. Such a dramatic gesture would underscore the aberrant and toxic nature of Trump’s candidacy and demonstrate that Clinton is the far safer choice.I suspect that Bush believes that Clinton is preferable to Trump. Several of his Cabinet members — former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff — are backing Clinton, as are numerous lower-level officials from his and his father’s administrations. They all know that the next president is either going to be Clinton or Trump, and God help us if it’s Trump.If George W. Bush breaks his silence, history will remember him as a hero of the 2016 election, a man who put country over party and transcended the poisonous partisanship that has brought America to the edge of the abyss.There is perhaps no other figure with the same ability to play this role.And given the stakes, those who can must. Anything less is unconscionable."

Even when we got “neat and clean for Gene” (McCarthy that is), the activists were largely younger, white students. And I don’t recall an election when the level of anxiety, sleeplessness, nervous drinking and eating, and emotional ups and downs was so pronounced. I like to think of this surfeit of angst as energy ready to be channeled into the causes that got us involved in this election to begin with.Regardless of the results of this election, there’s an expanded base of activists with some valuable experience under their belts ready to step up and take action in the next administration, in the struggle to overcome hatred and bigotry."

So here, in these last days, I’ll weigh in briefly with what my choice ultimately boiled down to for me: When the final results are in Tuesday night, what do I want to be able to say to my 9-year-old and my 7-year-old about who their next president is?In 2008, this moment was revelatory: I was bathing my then almost 2-year-old son Xavier (who since birth has been negotiating the challenges of cerebral palsy and epilepsy) when Barack Obama was officially proclaimed the future 44th president of the United States. I looked at Xavier... he smiled. I teared up, my heart swelled and I told him it was just proven without a doubt that the impossible IS possible, that his own potential was limitless and he could be whatever he wanted to be when he grew up.In 2012, more of the same ― but now I got to say it to my then 3-year-old daughter Phoebe too, who in her lifetime has never known a president OTHER than Barack Obama. Wow. And now in 2016 she has the potential to see a woman rise to the top post of our nation for the first time in U.S. history ― which will also be a truly awesome milestone of possibility to celebrate.But even more than that, I want to be able to tell my children whether or not I or their father agree with the politics of our next president, that our next president is worthy of our respect and support. That our president at her or his core is a decent human being who is doing her or his best to make our country stronger and create more opportunity for the majority of Americans. That our president values and respects women, the LGBTQ community, people with disabilities, people of color and people with varied religious beliefs.For me, it is glaringly obvious that there is only one candidate in true contention for the presidency who fits this description: Hillary Clinton. Which is why my sister and Good Black News Lifestyle Editor Lesa Lakin produced the political ad below and why I agreed to have me and my children take part in it (we are at the :12 mark). I wanted Xavier and Phoebe to know who I supported, and why it was worth putting ourselves out there to do so.As difficult and divisive as our current times can be, as I do on my website Good Black News, in everyday life I work hard to stay focussed on the positive (and some days, as we all know, that is REALLY REALLY hard). I always want my children to live in a welcoming atmosphere of possibility, encouragement and hope. Of civility and decency. Of responsibility, fairness, and a willingness to admit one’s mistakes and do better. I want the same values they are learning to live by at home and school ― to listen, be polite, not name call, take turns, share ― to be values I can say our nation’s leader lives by as well. Come Wednesday morning, if Hillary Clinton has won, I can say that to them.But if she doesn’t win... frankly, I don’t know what I’m going to say.A version of this post originally appeared on goodblacknews.org."

Right up there with baby giggles and good wine. But it is good to be aware of all of the tricks that are out there, and more importantly, how to avoid them. With a record number of people immersing themselves into different cultures and countries, it’s not surprising that a number of travel scams have become common practice throughout the world. Luckily for visitors, these travel scams seem to take on a very similar nature no matter where you go, so with a bit of knowledge they can be easily avoided. Here is a list of some of the most common travel scams around the world to look out for as a solo traveler, and tips on how to avoid them:The Bump and GrabIn many cities, if you see a large group of people congregating around a landmark or market, try to pay special attention to your pockets, backpack, or purse. This is a favorite time for the bump and grab, as thieves know you are occupied and surrounded, so they can bump you and grab your stuff, then dart away. The surrounding crowd then makes it hard to notice you've been bumped, and even harder to catch the thief who nabbed your stuff. It is so simple, yet so effective.How to avoid it: Keep all valuables zipped up in safe pockets and, if you feel like a distraction ploy is happening, don’t be scared to turn around and check for the guilty party. Hold your wallet or purse tight when you can, and keep your eyes peeled.ATM ScamsWhile ATM fraud happens more often in the United States than it does in Europe or other countries, it is always good to be aware. Always try to use ATMs at banks, as thieves shy away from surveillance cameras. And watch out for common ATM scams like card skimming and money grabbers (sort of like the Bump and Grab)How to avoid it: As always, be aware of your surrounds. If the ATM feels shady, off, strange, weird. Something is probably up with it. Remember to use ATMs at banks that look credible, and always cover your hand when putting in your pin. It is simple, but can make a big difference is if someone is lurking near by.The Driver Scam Most of us are familiar with this one - the taxi driver (or tuk tuk driver) chooses a longer route, claiming to avoid traffic, but in reality it’s to jack up the fare. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to know when to argue with the driver if you're in an unfamiliar place.How to avoid it: Negotiate your rate for the driver in advance. Take your time choosing a taxi or a driver, and make sure they use a meter. With today's GPS systems and maps, research your route before you get in the car or other moving vehicles. Ticket ScamsBeware of cheap tickets and refundable schemes. if it doesn’t seem like the right price (aka a significant discount from what you would pay the window of the event or attraction) I highly recommend not purchasing. You could be out that money, and still not be able to enter!How to avoid it: only buy from an accredited ticket office, so you know you what you have is legit, and you can go back if you have any concerns.Tour Scams Purchasing tours and tickets from someone on the street can be sketchy. You just never know what you are really getting! But to save money, you decide to book a tour to Tuscan wine country for the next day, only to go outside your hotel and find a rickety bus and no tour guide (or no bus at all!)How to avoid it: This has happened to me more times than I would like to admit, so ask those questions! as with above, only buy from an accredited ticket office, so you know you what you have is legit. You want to know the details of your tour, including: date, pick up time, tour length, stops, etc. Different countries have different issues with this, so make sure you ask these questions from the very beginning.The Conversion Rate/Charge You More Scam“Would you like to pay in (local currency) or U.S. dollars today?”This is a phrase you will hear often when traveling abroad. From your hotel to local vendors. You only have so much cash, so you want to make sure it goes as far as possible, right? Well sometimes these savvy dealers know that you only have so much US cash and/or foreign currency, and either want you to pay with your credit card or with the US dollar you do have... and then use an absurd conversion rate to jack up the price from the local currency price.How to avoid it: This is an issue from Hertz to Hilton to local vendors, so know the conversion rate, and try your damnedest to get enough local currency before you go and only pay with that. If they say you can pay with your credit card or US Dollars, make sure you know the conversion rate beforehand!Visit me on my blog, ALittleBitAdrift.com, for more travel tips and inspiration.

The reason an off-duty police officer felt the need to start waving his gun around and pointing it at a lot of different people is baffling. To see the video, click here.I, however, don’t want to focus on the killing itself ― I want to focus on the reaction of white people. Specifically in Mount Greenwood, where the incident occurred. Last night, hours after his death, while people gathered to support Josh’s family, some residents of Mount Greenwood came out of their homes with Blue Lives Matter flags to apparently show that Black people are not welcome in Mount Greenwood. Instead of letting people grieve the loss of a life, these white residents thought it appropriate to call them names and tell them to leave “their” neighborhood. To see this video click here.It would be easy to write that group of flag-waving people off as not representative of the Mount Greenwood neighborhood, but unfortunately that neighborhood has a very long history of trying to stay white while keeping Black people out.It was a common saying for Black Chicagoans who lived in the Morgan Park, Beverly, and Roseland areas in the ‘90s to say, “Don’t go west of Western,” because you would be venturing into Mount Greenwood.While white Chicago likes to try to cover up our racism, Mount Greenwood has historically been a neighborhood that flaunts racism more openly.Are all white people in Mount Greenwood blatantly racist? Hopefully not, but because of its past, not being racist in Mount Greenwood is difficult. It is tough to not be racist as a white person in America, period, but some places like Mount Greenwood make it harder than others.Here is a brief history of Mount Greenwood’s racist past:In 1968, the Chicago Tribune published an article about how 11 Black elementary students wanted to attend an elementary school in Mount Greenwood. White parents protested the fact that Black students would be going to “their” school.In 1992 the New York Times wrote an article about the feeling the white residents of Mount Greenwood had about Black people. One of the quotes among many that stuck out was:“I don’t mind them, but I don’t want them living next to me,” said Peggy O’Connor, a waitress and wife of a police officer. “I don’t want to be too close to them. I think they’ve been whining too long, and I’m sick of it.”Also in 1992, the Chicago Reader wrote about how the residents of Mount Greenwood did not want a new magnet high school built in their community. Some of the reasons that people cited of why they didn’t want students from other schools to come to this new school is because, “you have felons in that school,” referring to the schools in other communities, and they didn’t want “more noisy, littering, grass-stomping students.” The residents perpetuated stereotypes of black people being lazy, criminal, loud and messy.In 2008, seven of the Black students who had integrated that Mount Greenwood elementary school in 1968 returned for their 40th elementary reunion. They were greeted with a Swastika on the door of the school and people across the street telling them to “go back to your old school.”In 2010, on a community blog, someone described a scene in which a group of white teenagers on a summer evening started chasing people and yelling, “all sp*cs and ni**ers out of the fu**ing park!”In 2014 at McNally’s, a bar in Mount Greenwood, a police offIcer could be heard saying, “There are too many Black people in here.”Also in 2014, racist graffiti was found in six different locations in the area, including the N-word being spray painted onto vehicles.The reason for this history lesson is because as a white person I know we love to try to pretend that racism does not exist or it is something that is over with. The tragic murder of another Black person by a police officer and the reactions of the community to the death show us once again that racism is alive and well.The options are simple as white people. We can work to change the system of policing by admitting there is a problem with it. Once we admit the system of policing has a problem, we can then work to fix it. This option would benefit our whole society. People of color wouldn’t need to fear the police, the police would feel safer, and then white people wouldn’t have to hear as much about racism.The other option is we can get defensive, chant “Blue Lives Matter,” wave the American flag when someone is killed, call Black people names, wear Confederate flag shirts, and just continue the systems that let policing and white supremacy operate unchecked in our city and country.Clearly by these videos, far too many people are choosing my second option..."

And a U.S. election led by two candidates with vastly different views on environmental policy could affect America’s place in any future negotiations.Here are four big things to pay attention to at this year’s COP, which starts Monday and ends Nov. 18:How Do We Live Up To Paris?The Marrakech meeting will focus on how to implement the Paris agreement now that it’s been ratified into force. While last year’s deal put countries on record with their individual commitments for cutting emissions, many still need to determine how they will implement those plans.Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy at the Union for Concerned Scientists, a science advocacy group based in the U.S., said the conversation in Morocco will largely focus on solidifying nations’ efforts by a deadline set for 2018. And the challenge is vast.“There are more than 100 elements spelled out that [officials] have to grapple with, some of them more technical, some more political,” Meyer said. “But they’ll all take time.”Under the Paris framework, each country’s goals are voluntary, and a country that fails to adhere to promised emissions cuts won’t face any repercussions. But many countries, including the China and the U.S., have already announced plans curb emissions. There has also been a recent international agreement on phasing out the use of a heat-trapping refrigerant called hydrofluorocarbons, which is seen as progress toward meeting the goals of the Paris deal.Meyer said the Marrakech meeting will seek to build on that momentum, aiming to keep global warming well below the 2-degree Celsius limit laid out in Paris ― the level scientists say we must stay beneath to avoid the worst effects of climate change. How Do We Pay For It?The transition to a low- and no-carbon economy will be expensive, requiring a reallocation of up to $90 trillion in investments toward renewable infrastructure, according to a recent report from the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate.Much of that burden is expected to fall on the shoulders of rich nations like the U.S. and the European Union, and rapidly developing nations like China ― which also happen to be the world’s biggest polluters. The Paris agreement includes a pledge to jointly raise $100 billion a year by 2020 to help developing nations cope with climate change.But the private sector and local governments around the world are also expected to play a big role in any transition to a low-carbon future, according to Andrew Steer, CEO of the World Resources Institute, a Washington-based environmental organization.“We live in a totally different world now. ... This is not just about government-to-government [action],” Steer said during a press call last week. “One of the reasons that we have the Paris deal is that we had other actors that were helping governments to raise their game.”But both rich and developing nations ― namely in Africa and Southeast Asia, which are expected to grow quickly as more than a billion people still lack basic energy ― will need to participate in the conversation about raising and spending that money. “It’s very important in the context of sustainable development goals that we speak of prosperity for everyone,” said Mariana Panuncio-Feldman, the World Wildlife Fund’s senior director of international climate cooperation. “We need to convert energy systems for those that have energy, but also laying groundwork for those that don’t.”What Do We Need?Sustainable transit, land and forest protection, investment in renewables and a carbon tax are all expected to be discussed in Marrakech, both within the official negotiations and in the hundreds of side events that aim to increase the ambition laid out in Paris.What Will It Mean For The U.S.?President Barack Obama has made climate action and environmental protection central to his presidency, saying, “No challenge poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change.”But the U.S. election is taking place on the second day of the climate summit, and the two major-party candidates disagree on the country’s role in that fight: Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton is an ardent supporter of emissions cuts, but Republican nominee Donald Trump denies that climate change is even happening and has threatened to leave the Paris deal if he wins.While Morton noted the “candidates have very different views on climate,” he said in recent years there has been “a recognized inevitability of the transition to a low-carbon economy.” The world is moving forward, with or without the U.S.“I think the question will be what role and how quickly the U.S. moves,” he said. “The question of commitment to action is no longer one that is being debated … it’s how quickly it will move forward, and who will lead.”Kate Sheppard contributed reporting."

While last year’s deal put countries on record with their individual commitments for cutting emissions, many still need to determine how they will implement those plans.Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy at the Union for Concerned Scientists, a science advocacy group based in the U.S., said the conversation in Morocco will largely focus on solidifying nations’ efforts by a deadline set for 2018. And the challenge is vast.“There are more than 100 elements spelled out that [officials] have to grapple with, some of them more technical, some more political,” Meyer said. “But they’ll all take time.”Under the Paris framework, each country’s goals are voluntary, and a country that fails to adhere to promised emissions cuts won’t face any repercussions. But many countries, including the China and the U.S., have already announced plans curb emissions. There has also been a recent international agreement on phasing out the use of a heat-trapping refrigerant called hydrofluorocarbons, which is seen as progress toward meeting the goals of the Paris deal.Meyer said the Marrakech meeting will seek to build on that momentum, aiming to keep global warming well below the 2-degree Celsius limit laid out in Paris ― the level scientists say we must stay beneath to avoid the worst effects of climate change. How Do We Pay For It?The transition to a low- and no-carbon economy will be expensive, requiring a reallocation of up to $90 trillion in investments toward renewable infrastructure, according to a recent report from the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate.Much of that burden is expected to fall on the shoulders of rich nations like the U.S. and the European Union, and rapidly developing nations like China ― which also happen to be the world’s biggest polluters. The Paris agreement includes a pledge to jointly raise $100 billion a year by 2020 to help developing nations cope with climate change.But the private sector and local governments around the world are also expected to play a big role in any transition to a low-carbon future, according to Andrew Steer, CEO of the World Resources Institute, a Washington-based environmental organization.“We live in a totally different world now. ... This is not just about government-to-government [action],” Steer said during a press call last week. “One of the reasons that we have the Paris deal is that we had other actors that were helping governments to raise their game.”But both rich and developing nations ― namely in Africa and Southeast Asia, which are expected to grow quickly as more than a billion people still lack basic energy ― will need to participate in the conversation about raising and spending that money. “It’s very important in the context of sustainable development goals that we speak of prosperity for everyone,” said Mariana Panuncio-Feldman, the World Wildlife Fund’s senior director of international climate cooperation. “We need to convert energy systems for those that have energy, but also laying groundwork for those that don’t.”What Do We Need?Sustainable transit, land and forest protection, investment in renewables and a carbon tax are all expected to be discussed in Marrakech, both within the official negotiations and in the hundreds of side events that aim to increase the ambition laid out in Paris.What Will It Mean For The U.S.?President Barack Obama has made climate action and environmental protection central to his presidency, saying, “No challenge poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change.”But the U.S. election is taking place on the second day of the climate summit, and the two major-party candidates disagree on the country’s role in that fight: Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton is an ardent supporter of emissions cuts, but Republican nominee Donald Trump denies that climate change is even happening and has threatened to leave the Paris deal if he wins.While Morton noted the “candidates have very different views on climate,” he said in recent years there has been “a recognized inevitability of the transition to a low-carbon economy.” The world is moving forward, with or without the U.S.“I think the question will be what role and how quickly the U.S. moves,” he said. “The question of commitment to action is no longer one that is being debated … it’s how quickly it will move forward, and who will lead.”Kate Sheppard contributed reporting."

In fact, as CBS’s John Dickerson noted in a recent piece, Clinton is making a strategic play to turn out a specific subset of the male vote.The campaign has been targeting dads, trying to turn GOP nominee Donald Trump’s history of misogyny against him by appealing specifically to fathers of daughters. This Sunday night, Clinton will put some money behind the effort. The campaign will run two television advertisements during the Sunday Night Football game. One ad features the testimonial of a father, the other that of a grandfather, each of whom is a Republican explaining that Trump’s remarks about women have forced them to vote Democrat this cycle.  Clinton won’t end up winning the male vote. But her campaign’s goal is to soften Trump’s margin here. And they sense a vulnerability for the Republican nominee among those men who not only are politically moderate but have been disturbed by Trump’s remarks at a visceral level. As Dickerson reported: [Clinton’s camp was] surprised to learn that fathers were reacting strongly to Trump’s comments. To experiment with their finding, they sent out four different family-related messages to voters in target areas. They called it their “divisiveness track,” targeting voters who might be moved by hearing Donald Trump’s words. What they had seen in surveys and focus groups was reaffirmed in the field: fathers were moved away from Trump by the message. The Clinton campaign even saw movement among the voting bloc that Clinton has had the most trouble reaching ― the white non-college-educated voters.HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

The pop star showed her support for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton once again on Saturday when she performed at the “Get Out The Vote” rally in Philadelphia. Naturally, she was dressed in a patriotic outfit made up of a stars-and-stripes dress and a dramatic blue cape with the words “I’m with Madame President” on it. After Clinton urged the crowd to get out to the polls on Tuesday, she introduced the 32-year-old singer. Perry walked onstage as Janet Jackson’s 1986 hit “Nasty” played over the sound system ― a nod to when Donald Trump called Clinton a “nasty woman” during the final presidential debate. Perry performed her hits like “Roar” and “Firework,” and also encouraged the crowd to exercise their right to vote.“A couple of weeks ago I knocked on college dorm rooms in Las Vegas. ... The smells coming out of there were interesting. But I think we got the vote,” she told the crowd, before asking them to “join me in lifting [Clinton] up now, and into her presidency.”Perry has shown plenty of support for Clinton throughout this entire election season. Last October, Perry appeared at a rally for the former secretary of state in Iowa, and this past July, she performed at the Democratic National Convention. In September, the “I Kissed a Girl” singer appeared in a Funny or Die video in which she jokingly tried to vote while nude, and this Halloween, she dressed up as Clinton, complete with prosthetic makeup and a red pantsuit. Finally, Perry’s “Roar” is the soundtrack to Clinton’s closing campaign ad, which will be shown in the 11 battleground states of Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, according to Politico."

On Sunday, the pop star called out Donald Trump’s wife, who said in a recent speech that as first lady, she would make it her mission to combat bullying. In a tweet, Gaga pointed out the tone-deaf nature of Melania’s statements, given the fact that her husband “is 1 of the most notorious bullies we have ever witnessed.” The singer also urged her followers to “stop this dangerous man from continuing to divide and wreck our democracy” and to “put on your hats and #GoVote.” Of course, this isn’t the first time the “Bad Romance” singer has spoken out against Trump. When asked about her thoughts on a potential Trump presidency during an interview with BBC Breakfast in October, Gaga simply said, “I have nothing to say of him.” In that same interview, the Golden Globe winner spoke about Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, saying, “I think she will do a good job. Some people want to win races. Other people want to be president of the United States and change people’s lives. It’s about the intention.”Earlier this year, Gaga also showed her support for Clinton in the most Gaga way possible: by posing in a stars-and-stripes swimsuit. Gaga’s definitely with her. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.Donate below to support women, Latinos, Muslims, other groups Donald Trump has insulted."

Originally from the South (born in Tennessee, raised in Kentucky), thankfully due to the U.K.’s progressive views on equality, I was able to move to the U.K. and join Megan in 2012. We rejoiced all the way in our home in Windsor when same-sex marriage was legalized across all 50 states in America. This meant that we could have a future together in the U.S. one day. We could get married, and legally Megan can move there. Next year, in fact, we are getting married in Palm Springs, California, and converting from a civil partnership to a marriage. We have friends and family traveling all over from the U.K. and U.S. to share in our special day. However, now we fear for our future and the whole LGBT community if Trump were to become president in a mere few days.Even though I’m watching the presidential election debates all the way across the pond, to see my friends and family post online that they are supporting Trump fills me with a deep sadness and, quite honestly, horror. I know I’m not the only one. On the one hand, they support and love Megan and me as a couple, and yet on the other hand they’re choosing to vote for a sexist, racist and homophobic man who believes in “traditional” marriage between a man and a woman. If Trump gets elected, he has said he will “strongly consider” appointing judges to over-turn same-sex marriage. Not only this, but he would quite like to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation as he think it’s only “fair” we all have the same protection as other Americans (source HRC). I don’t think we’ll ever see the day that people start getting fired from work, refused a double bed at a motel or kicked out of a restaurant for being heterosexual. Due to “straight privilege,” they already have a protection that LGBT people will never have.We have made so many steps towards equality in America, not only with same-sex marriage, but with a much loved first black president and the first woman in U.S. history to become the presidential nominee for a major political party. How can we go from that to a “leader” who is a former reality TV star and wants to un-do all of the good that has been done? He’s made the presidential election debates a complete mockery, and you would not see that happen in the U.K. You wouldn’t opt for a entrepreneur with charisma vs. a top surgeon with 30 years experience to conduct your open-heart surgery, so why would you opt for a man who has zero experience in politics vs. a well-educated woman with over 30 years of legal and political experience to become one of the most powerful leaders of the world.So dearest family and friends, I urge you to reconsider your vote for Trump. Even though you may not like Hillary (though of course, we strongly do), Hillary will have the most positive and progressive impact not only for us but for future generations. This is even more pertinent as a couple who plan to embark on the journey towards motherhood soon. In the words of FLOTUS, Michelle Obama: “And because of Hillary Clinton, my daughters and all of our sons and daughters now take for granted that a woman can be president of the United States.”Hillary Clinton endorses gay marriage equality, calls for an end to transgender violence, the Equality Act is her highest priority, she supports LGBT youth and their families and whats more, Hillary stands in support for LGBT equality worldwide (source HRC).If you are with us, then you are with her.

50,IMPACT,Survivor Speaks Out Against Amish Rape Culture Ahead Of Sentencing,"Mary Simms, ContributorCEO & Founder, The Mary Simms Public Relations Agency",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/survivor-speaks-out-against-amish-rape-culture-ahead_us_581e7b02e4b0334571e09cfd,"""From the day you're born, especially as a female, you’re groomed to be a victim.""",2016-11-06,<p>Torah Bontrager after escaping the Amish at age 15.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/581e83a5190000a504c31215.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Rape Survivor Torah Bontrager shares her journey of stealing back her own freedom by breaking all the rules and setting herself free.Torah Bontrager’s betrayal by those closest to her began at age four. In the shielded-from-view world of her Amish community, her ordeal started with severe parental physical and verbal abuse followed by uncles’ serial rapes. At 15, Torah fled to the false safety of a divorced paternal uncle in Montana who, shortly after her arrival, raped her more times than she could remember over the course of 7 months. I spoke to Bontrager as she awaited the trial in Columbia County, Wisconsin of one of her uncles, Enos Bontrager, a blatant alleged sexual predator who finally ― more than 20 years after he first molested Torah ― will stand trial. On November 29th, Enos Bontrager, 48, will stand trial charged with four counts of sexual assault of a child under 13 years old, two counts of second-degree sexual assault of a child, and one count of sexual assault of a child under 16. Torah’s accusations of Enos Bontrager’s repeated rapes will not be part of those proceedings because local authorities –despite Torah’s efforts to hold her uncle accountable ―allowed the statute of limitations to expire.Bontrager, the author of the forthcoming book “An Amish Girl in Manhattan: A Memoir,” and I discussed her nightmarish but all too common experience against a backdrop of a national discussion of sexual assault that has become a part of the conversation and debate in the presidential election.Mary: When I think of Amish culture, I think of minimalism, growing vegetables from heirloom seeds, raising animals, hunting deer and foraging for mushrooms, berries and plants in the wild. But, after speaking with you, I also think of rape. And the sad reality of Amish rape culture is that so many young girls fall victim and can’t escape. Why is this?Torah: It’s a culture that, from the get-go, from the day you’re born, especially as a female, you’re groomed to be a victim. The patriarchal structure, the hierarchy, is one huge problem. That’s the foundation of the problem. God is number one; then it’s the husband; then it’s the wife; then it’s the children, then the animals. The wife literally has to promise on her wedding day to obey her husband for the rest of her life.The biblical commandment “honor your parents” is interpreted as a literal “obey your parents no matter what” and is constantly enforced. It’s one of the first things I learned as a child—before I could probably even talk. You’re not ever supposed to say “no” to your parents or “no” to adults, certainly not adults in positions of authority such as aunts, uncles, grandparents, teachers and preachers.If you say “no”, you get reprimanded and shamed at best and usually physically punished. Spanked, hit, beaten, whipped—depending on the perceived severity of the crime and disposition of the adult.What that level of continual enforcement does is groom women and children, especially female children, to be victims. Of course, then, when an authority figure, especially a male, approaches you, you’ve already been trained and pre-conditioned to say “yes” to whatever that adult demands of you. At the very least, you don’t resist and you don’t protest out of fear of getting a severe beating, getting sent to bed hungry, or punished in whatever other ways in which you’ve already experienced.The Amish refuse to educate their children about even the basics of sex, so you’re also not taught to recognize the signs of sexual advances and predatory characteristics. They won’t even warn their children of known child molesters and rapists within the community. They pretend that the rampant sexual assault found in almost every community doesn’t exist. The Amish attitude toward sexual assault is so bad that when a female is raped, she is punished for “being too tempting” to the male and is required to ask the male attacker’s forgiveness for having tempted him.Mary: You were sexually assaulted multiple times by men in your own family. Can you share a little bit about that? Torah: Yes. I was first molested by my uncle, Enos Bontrager, when I was around six years old but I didn't understand what was going on. I didn't think in terms of, ""Oh, I'm being molested."" I just knew that something really bad had happened. There was something very wrong. I escaped from my Amish parents, Henry and Ida, in the middle of the night because of how severely they both abused me. I thought I’d be safe with my Montana uncle. I trusted him completely and without question. He was the only person I knew who understood me, I thought, because he had also escaped from his father—my paternal grandfather—when he was young. Never once did it ever occur to me that he would rape me, or that I wouldn’t be safe with him. It was a beyond heinous situation of jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire.Mary: Do you think that the physical abuse lent itself to you being victim to sexual abuse? Torah: Of course. What child is going to say no, after getting beaten and abused in various other ways so many times? Especially a female, where you’re a second-class citizen, and an older male, especially male authority figures like my uncles, comes and demands something from you. Mary: Unlike many victims of physical and sexual abuse, you were able to escape. You almost did so by means of a self-inflicted bullet. What was within you that gave you the fortitude within yourself, to be able to escape by means other than suicide in such a difficult situation, when you felt that was your only option? Torah: I had never had any sort of good relationship with my mother; and my father turned increasingly more sadistic and tyrannical the older I got. He’s a bona fide sociopath, or psychopath. So because I still hadn’t figured out a way to get out of there, I tried to kill myself. Before I pulled the trigger, I had this thought that ran through my head, “I want to live”. And I realized in that moment that that was the first time that I had ever thought in terms of ""I want to live"" instead of ""I want to die”. Mary: We live in a society where we tell girls they can grow up to be anything they want. They can grow up to be the president of the United States. But for many of these girls, that isn’t an option and they don’t have a way out. What’s the solution for them? Torah: The solution is that there is a way out. If you’re reading this or hearing this, you have a way out. There is support here for you. You’re not alone and you’re not crazy. Find a domestic violence shelter and they will help you; and then of course, email or call me. I have a list of resources in my book and that list will also be posted on my website. In terms of the girls—and boys—who are lost in the Amish system, who don’t know about me or how to get out, that’s something I’m on a mission to change. This includes helping equip those who have already left the Amish with more skills, such as learning when and when not to trust people, because they've been taught to obey and never question. The kids have no discernment skills. They get into drugs, they can't read people, they get taken advantage of. There are all sorts of cases where they’ve gotten caught in human trafficking, sex slavery, criminal pursuits, things like that, because they just… They don't know how to assess people nor how to protect themselves. These are all things that I want to offer. Creating this support system has been one of my dreams from way back when I was a young teenage Amish girl who vowed that someday if she made it, she would help the ones left behind. Mary: What do you want people to take away from your book? Torah: Ultimately I want people to get it that yes, you can have the life of your dreams. If you really want to be happy, then—unless you have a debilitating situation—take back your power and set yourself free. It’s okay to be afraid but it’s not okay to let fear control your happiness, or lack of happiness. All brave people feel fear. All the time. I didn’t escape because I wasn’t afraid. I escaped because I valued myself and my personal dream of happiness more. I was determined to one day be free or die trying. I hope that one of the things that people get from my book is how to turn their tragedies into assets and what I call steal back their freedom, by breaking all the rules. No matter whether you’re Amish or not, most people are unhappy with their lives or businesses or other situations. There is always a way to turn the worst of what happens into a payoff, but it often means breaking the rules of whatever culture or society or family that you’re part of. It’s not necessarily easy to go against whatever everyone else says and follow your heart, but I hope I can offer tools and different ways of thinking that make it a little bit easier and at the least, let you know that you’re not alone. So, take personal responsibility for your life. If you’re not happy, do something about it. You are not powerless. If you’re reading or hearing this, then you definitely are not powerless. I’ve been through the worst of hells a million times and back. I’ve wanted to kill myself at least six times over the past 20 years. I have no shame in saying that. I know what what it feels like to be all alone and not see a way out. Some of the very hard lessons I’ve had to learn are that no one can save me and I can save no one else but me.. Keep believing in yourself and your right to be happy and free. Mary: After everything you’ve been through, do you still believe in God? Torah: God is love, kindness, compassion and wisdom. What’s true for me is that despite all the evil on this planet, love is still a far more powerful force in the universe. The bad things that happened to me is an example of humans taking religion and perverting it for their own nefarious purposes. If it doesn’t come from love, it’s not from God.

51,IMPACT,Survivor Speaks Out Against Amish Rape Culture Ahead Of Sentencing,"Mary Simms, ContributorCEO & Founder, The Mary Simms Public Relations Agency",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/survivor-speaks-out-against-amish-rape-culture-ahead_us_581e7b02e4b0334571e09cfd,"""From the day you're born, especially as a female, you’re groomed to be a victim.""",2016-11-06,"<p>Mugshot of Torah Bontrager’s Uncle, Enos Bontrager, a blatant alleged sexual predator who finally -- more than 20 years after he first molested Torah – will stand trial.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/581ee4d316000017002c8a6d.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Rape Survivor Torah Bontrager shares her journey of stealing back her own freedom by breaking all the rules and setting herself free.Torah Bontrager’s betrayal by those closest to her began at age four. In the shielded-from-view world of her Amish community, her ordeal started with severe parental physical and verbal abuse followed by uncles’ serial rapes. At 15, Torah fled to the false safety of a divorced paternal uncle in Montana who, shortly after her arrival, raped her more times than she could remember over the course of 7 months. I spoke to Bontrager as she awaited the trial in Columbia County, Wisconsin of one of her uncles, Enos Bontrager, a blatant alleged sexual predator who finally ― more than 20 years after he first molested Torah ― will stand trial. On November 29th, Enos Bontrager, 48, will stand trial charged with four counts of sexual assault of a child under 13 years old, two counts of second-degree sexual assault of a child, and one count of sexual assault of a child under 16. Torah’s accusations of Enos Bontrager’s repeated rapes will not be part of those proceedings because local authorities –despite Torah’s efforts to hold her uncle accountable ―allowed the statute of limitations to expire.Bontrager, the author of the forthcoming book “An Amish Girl in Manhattan: A Memoir,” and I discussed her nightmarish but all too common experience against a backdrop of a national discussion of sexual assault that has become a part of the conversation and debate in the presidential election.Mary: When I think of Amish culture, I think of minimalism, growing vegetables from heirloom seeds, raising animals, hunting deer and foraging for mushrooms, berries and plants in the wild. But, after speaking with you, I also think of rape. And the sad reality of Amish rape culture is that so many young girls fall victim and can’t escape. Why is this?Torah: It’s a culture that, from the get-go, from the day you’re born, especially as a female, you’re groomed to be a victim. The patriarchal structure, the hierarchy, is one huge problem. That’s the foundation of the problem. God is number one; then it’s the husband; then it’s the wife; then it’s the children, then the animals. The wife literally has to promise on her wedding day to obey her husband for the rest of her life.The biblical commandment “honor your parents” is interpreted as a literal “obey your parents no matter what” and is constantly enforced. It’s one of the first things I learned as a child—before I could probably even talk. You’re not ever supposed to say “no” to your parents or “no” to adults, certainly not adults in positions of authority such as aunts, uncles, grandparents, teachers and preachers.If you say “no”, you get reprimanded and shamed at best and usually physically punished. Spanked, hit, beaten, whipped—depending on the perceived severity of the crime and disposition of the adult.What that level of continual enforcement does is groom women and children, especially female children, to be victims. Of course, then, when an authority figure, especially a male, approaches you, you’ve already been trained and pre-conditioned to say “yes” to whatever that adult demands of you. At the very least, you don’t resist and you don’t protest out of fear of getting a severe beating, getting sent to bed hungry, or punished in whatever other ways in which you’ve already experienced.The Amish refuse to educate their children about even the basics of sex, so you’re also not taught to recognize the signs of sexual advances and predatory characteristics. They won’t even warn their children of known child molesters and rapists within the community. They pretend that the rampant sexual assault found in almost every community doesn’t exist. The Amish attitude toward sexual assault is so bad that when a female is raped, she is punished for “being too tempting” to the male and is required to ask the male attacker’s forgiveness for having tempted him.Mary: You were sexually assaulted multiple times by men in your own family. Can you share a little bit about that? Torah: Yes. I was first molested by my uncle, Enos Bontrager, when I was around six years old but I didn't understand what was going on. I didn't think in terms of, ""Oh, I'm being molested."" I just knew that something really bad had happened. There was something very wrong. I escaped from my Amish parents, Henry and Ida, in the middle of the night because of how severely they both abused me. I thought I’d be safe with my Montana uncle. I trusted him completely and without question. He was the only person I knew who understood me, I thought, because he had also escaped from his father—my paternal grandfather—when he was young. Never once did it ever occur to me that he would rape me, or that I wouldn’t be safe with him. It was a beyond heinous situation of jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire.Mary: Do you think that the physical abuse lent itself to you being victim to sexual abuse? Torah: Of course. What child is going to say no, after getting beaten and abused in various other ways so many times? Especially a female, where you’re a second-class citizen, and an older male, especially male authority figures like my uncles, comes and demands something from you. Mary: Unlike many victims of physical and sexual abuse, you were able to escape. You almost did so by means of a self-inflicted bullet. What was within you that gave you the fortitude within yourself, to be able to escape by means other than suicide in such a difficult situation, when you felt that was your only option? Torah: I had never had any sort of good relationship with my mother; and my father turned increasingly more sadistic and tyrannical the older I got. He’s a bona fide sociopath, or psychopath. So because I still hadn’t figured out a way to get out of there, I tried to kill myself. Before I pulled the trigger, I had this thought that ran through my head, “I want to live”. And I realized in that moment that that was the first time that I had ever thought in terms of ""I want to live"" instead of ""I want to die”. Mary: We live in a society where we tell girls they can grow up to be anything they want. They can grow up to be the president of the United States. But for many of these girls, that isn’t an option and they don’t have a way out. What’s the solution for them? Torah: The solution is that there is a way out. If you’re reading this or hearing this, you have a way out. There is support here for you. You’re not alone and you’re not crazy. Find a domestic violence shelter and they will help you; and then of course, email or call me. I have a list of resources in my book and that list will also be posted on my website. In terms of the girls—and boys—who are lost in the Amish system, who don’t know about me or how to get out, that’s something I’m on a mission to change. This includes helping equip those who have already left the Amish with more skills, such as learning when and when not to trust people, because they've been taught to obey and never question. The kids have no discernment skills. They get into drugs, they can't read people, they get taken advantage of. There are all sorts of cases where they’ve gotten caught in human trafficking, sex slavery, criminal pursuits, things like that, because they just… They don't know how to assess people nor how to protect themselves. These are all things that I want to offer. Creating this support system has been one of my dreams from way back when I was a young teenage Amish girl who vowed that someday if she made it, she would help the ones left behind. Mary: What do you want people to take away from your book? Torah: Ultimately I want people to get it that yes, you can have the life of your dreams. If you really want to be happy, then—unless you have a debilitating situation—take back your power and set yourself free. It’s okay to be afraid but it’s not okay to let fear control your happiness, or lack of happiness. All brave people feel fear. All the time. I didn’t escape because I wasn’t afraid. I escaped because I valued myself and my personal dream of happiness more. I was determined to one day be free or die trying. I hope that one of the things that people get from my book is how to turn their tragedies into assets and what I call steal back their freedom, by breaking all the rules. No matter whether you’re Amish or not, most people are unhappy with their lives or businesses or other situations. There is always a way to turn the worst of what happens into a payoff, but it often means breaking the rules of whatever culture or society or family that you’re part of. It’s not necessarily easy to go against whatever everyone else says and follow your heart, but I hope I can offer tools and different ways of thinking that make it a little bit easier and at the least, let you know that you’re not alone. So, take personal responsibility for your life. If you’re not happy, do something about it. You are not powerless. If you’re reading or hearing this, then you definitely are not powerless. I’ve been through the worst of hells a million times and back. I’ve wanted to kill myself at least six times over the past 20 years. I have no shame in saying that. I know what what it feels like to be all alone and not see a way out. Some of the very hard lessons I’ve had to learn are that no one can save me and I can save no one else but me.. Keep believing in yourself and your right to be happy and free. Mary: After everything you’ve been through, do you still believe in God? Torah: God is love, kindness, compassion and wisdom. What’s true for me is that despite all the evil on this planet, love is still a far more powerful force in the universe. The bad things that happened to me is an example of humans taking religion and perverting it for their own nefarious purposes. If it doesn’t come from love, it’s not from God.

52,POLITICS,A SEAL And A Harvard Professor Walk Into A Room...,"Gautam Mukunda and James Waters, Contributors",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-seal-and-a-harvard-prof_b_12830728.html,"Usually, the two of us don't agree on anything about politics.",2016-11-06,"A combination photo shows Republican U.S. presidential nominee Donald Trump (L) and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton during their third and final debate at UNLV in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S. on October 19, 2016. REUTERS/Carlos Barria",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb833e43c000066000dc3af.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Usually, the two of us don't agree on anything about politics. James is a lifelong conservative Republican, a former staffer for the George W. Bush administration, and a former Navy SEAL who has led men in combat. Gautam is a lifelong Democrat, a Harvard Business School professor, and the author of Indispensable: When Leaders Really Matter. Two things unite us. The first is a fascination with leadership, whether as someone trained to lead men in battle as a Navy SEAL officer, or as a scholar who has published articles and a book on what makes leaders - particularly Presidents - successful. The second is the conclusion that this interest in leadership leads both of us to: that it is vitally important that Hillary Clinton overwhelmingly defeat Donald Trump. Studying presidents and working closely for President Bush convinced both of us that every president, regardless of party, must be able to do a number of things if they are to have any chance at success. They range from managing the federal bureaucracy, to communicating clearly with American allies and adversaries, to bringing people together to find creative solutions to the most complicated problems. It doesn't matter what your larger vision of the presidency is if these basics aren't taken care of. Think of them as the ""blocking and tackling"" required of the leader of the Free World. As in football, it doesn't matter how well you do everything else if you can't get these fundamentals right, and the higher the level at which you are playing, the more difficult it becomes to execute on even the most basic parts of the job well enough to succeed. The Presidency is called the hardest job in the world for a reason. Both research and personal observations tell us that in the Oval Office, like in the SEAL Teams, ""the only easy day was yesterday."" What does it take to get this blocking and tackling right? Three characteristics seem fundamental to the success of leaders in high pressure situations, from the presidency to business to the military. They are knowledge, skills, and temperament. These three are necessary but not sufficient for success - their presence does not guarantee it, but their absence guarantees failure absent extraordinary luck. Knowledge matters because even leaders who choose to delegate heavily must still know enough about the tasks they are delegating to give meaningful instructions and to judge the capabilities of their supporters. During the Civil War, for example, Lincoln - the beneficiary of less than a year of formal education - read extensively on military tactics and strategy, and his increasing knowledge allowed him to make crucial contributions to the Northern war effort. Similarly, George W. Bush accelerated his lifelong passion for reading in the depths of the Iraq war in 2006, immersing himself in books about leaders, history, and current events as he faced daunting decisions about whether to surge troops in Iraq.Knowledgeable leaders need skills if they are to put that knowledge to use. Successful Presidents have to be good at tasks as varied as management, diplomacy, and negotiations. What's more, these skills are very different in government than they are elsewhere. For example, negotiations in business result in contracts that are binding and enforced by courts. Negotiations in politics result in agreements that are, at best, self-enforcing. The President doesn't get to go to court if his or her negotiating partner breaks their word. Junior leaders in the SEAL teams all have the knowledge needed to lead from their training, but their skill still varies. Some fail because they are simply unable to relate to their men and harness their talent to get them to follow them and get the job done. Finally there's the question of temperament. Leaders who deal with high-stress situations must be able to think clearly and act deliberately under even the most extreme pressure. Only Washington's ability to keep his calm in the face of British and French provocation kept the United States out of what would surely have been a disastrous war during his Presidency. Eight years ago on a mountaintop in Afghanistan, it was the calm voice of James's Ground Force Commander that inspired trust in his entire team as he provided guidance while calling in airstrikes around them. Even as hundreds of terrorists attacked, he managed questions from his men, ensured the safety of non-combatants on the scene, spoke to aircraft overhead, updated leadership back at the base, and planned an exit route, all while talking over the radio as calmly as if he was catching up with his mother after a long day at work. Real leaders know that in the heat of the moment it's their job to be cool.These qualities don't guarantee success, but they do make it possible. So how do Clinton and Trump compare? The two of us have different opinions of Hillary Clinton, but we are both certain that she is more than capable of executing the fundamental blocking and tackling of the Presidency. Even if you give her no credit for learning anything during her time as First Lady, eight years in the Senate and four years as Secretary of State gave her plenty of time to build the knowledge and skills needed to do the job. Any fair assessment of her performance during the long sequence of debates during the primaries and general election, for example, would conclude that she has a level of detailed knowledge of issues facing the country rarely equaled in modern Presidential history. Skills and temperament are harder to judge from a distance, but Gautam's research shows that the people best able to judge whether a candidate for leadership can do the job are those who have both extended close personal contact with the candidate and extensive knowledge of the requirements of the job. Of the people who know both Hillary Clinton and the Presidency well, it's more than striking that they, overwhelmingly, seem to express no doubts whatsoever about her skill. There's a reason that every living former President, regardless of party, is supporting her, as are the two most recent Republican Secretaries of State. As for temperament, despite our radically different politics, we were both struck by her ability to stay calm and execute her debate strategy against Trump to extraordinary effect in the face of provocations without precedent in American history. Taken all in all, despite our political differences, we are united in our confidence that Hillary Clinton has everything it takes to do the job of President.Sadly, we can only say the opposite about Donald Trump. His ignorance of the workings of the American government is almost farcical (for one example among an endless number, he proclaimed that he wanted to protect ""Article 12"" of the Constitution when the Constitution has only 7 articles). He has not spent a single day in the military and by his own testimony doesn't read much at all, yet has so much confidence in his own knowledge that he's proclaimed that he knows more about how to beat ISIS than American generals do and can teach a former Dean of the Army War College about war. His serial business failures suggest that he is not much of a manager even in business, and his repeated vague proclamations about striking better deals for the United States suggest that he does not understand that government doesn't work by fiat. If that wasn't enough, going through three campaign managers since taking the nomination is hardly a sign of managerial skill. As for temperament, Trump's inability to remain calm under pressure speaks for itself - or if it doesn't, his Twitter account removes all doubt. His self-described ""thin skin"" was prominently displayed in the debates as he repeatedly let Clinton's needles distract him. It would be easy to describe the various ways in which Trump has shown that he lacks any ability to execute the basic tasks of the Presidency at virtually endless length. The problem isn't that there's no reason to believe that Trump is up to the job. The problem is that there is overwhelming evidence that he isn't even close - so much so that both of us are convinced that he is less fit for the Presidency than any presidential candidate since (at least) the 19th century.So that's reason enough for Trump to lose. But why is it important that he lose in a landslide? First, because when the damage that could be done by a completely incompetent president is so great, any chance of it happening is too great a risk. Polls can be wrong, and Trump is already beginning to challenge the legitimacy of his extremely likely defeat. Getting as many undecided voters as possible to the polls to vote for Clinton will both eliminate the chance of a catastrophic Trump Presidency and ensure that his margin of defeat is so great that even his most fanatical supporters will dismiss his talk of a rigged election. Second, however, and just as important, are that the consequences of a narrow Trump defeat and a landslide will be very different. The Republican Party's decision to nominate Donald Trump is, in our shared assessment, among the most irresponsible acts ever committed by an American political party. The choice by Republican leaders to support him even after his extraordinary combination of erratic behavior, incompetence, and boasting about committing sexual assault is perhaps the most extraordinary collective decision to put party before country in American history. Only a decisive defeat will send the unambiguous message that no one like Donald Trump can ever be allowed within sight of the Oval Office and that nothing like his nomination must ever happen again."

Not any longer. In 2016, the nuclear issue is back big time, thanks both to the rise of Donald Trump (including various unsettling comments he’s made about nuclear weapons) and actual changes in the global nuclear landscape.With passions running high on both sides in this year’s election and rising fears about Donald Trump’s impulsive nature and Hillary Clinton’s hawkish one, it’s hardly surprising that the “nuclear button” question has surfaced repeatedly throughout the campaign. In one of the more pointed exchanges of the first presidential debate, Hillary Clinton declared that Donald Trump lacked the mental composure for the job. “A man who can be provoked by a tweet,” she commented, “should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes.” Donald Trump has reciprocated by charging that Clinton is too prone to intervene abroad. “You’re going to end up in World War III over Syria,” he told reporters in Florida last month.For most election observers, however, the matter of personal character and temperament has dominated discussions of the nuclear issue, with partisans on each side insisting that the other candidate is temperamentally unfit to exercise control over the nuclear codes. There is, however, a more important reason to worry about whose finger will be on that button this time around: at this very moment, for a variety of reasons, the “nuclear threshold” -- the point at which some party to a “conventional” (non-nuclear) conflict chooses to employ atomic weapons -- seems to be moving dangerously lower.Not so long ago, it was implausible that a major nuclear power -- the United States, Russia, or China -- would consider using atomic weapons in any imaginable conflict scenario. No longer. Worse yet, this is likely to be our reality for years to come, which means that the next president will face a world in which a nuclear decision-making point might arrive far sooner than anyone would have thought possible just a year or two ago -- with potentially catastrophic consequences for us all.No less worrisome, the major nuclear powers (and some smaller ones) are all in the process of acquiring new nuclear arms, which could, in theory, push that threshold lower still. These include a variety of cruise missiles and other delivery systems capable of being used in “limited” nuclear wars -- atomic conflicts that, in theory at least, could be confined to just a single country or one area of the world (say, Eastern Europe) and so might be even easier for decision-makers to initiate. The next president will have to decide whether the U.S. should actually produce weapons of this type and also what measures should be taken in response to similar decisions by Washington’s likely adversaries.Lowering the Nuclear ThresholdDuring the dark days of the Cold War, nuclear strategists in the United States and the Soviet Union conjured up elaborate conflict scenarios in which military actions by the two superpowers and their allies might lead from, say, minor skirmishing along the Iron Curtain to full-scale tank combat to, in the end, the use of “battlefield” nuclear weapons, and then city-busting versions of the same to avert defeat. In some of these scenarios, strategists hypothesized about wielding “tactical” or battlefield weaponry -- nukes powerful enough to wipe out a major tank formation, but not Paris or Moscow -- and claimed that it would be possible to contain atomic warfare at such a devastating but still sub-apocalyptic level. (Henry Kissinger, for instance, made his reputation by preaching this lunatic doctrine in his first book, Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy.) Eventually, leaders on both sides concluded that the only feasible role for their atomic arsenals was to act as deterrents to the use of such weaponry by the other side. This was, of course, the concept of “mutually assured destruction,” or -- in one of the most classically apt acronyms of all times: MAD. It would, in the end, form the basis for all subsequent arms control agreements between the two superpowers.Anxiety over the escalatory potential of tactical nuclear weapons peaked in the 1970s when the Soviet Union began deploying the SS-20 intermediate-range ballistic missile (capable of striking cities in Europe, but not the U.S.) and Washington responded with plans to deploy nuclear-armed, ground-launched cruise missiles and the Pershing-II ballistic missile in Europe. The announcement of such plans provoked massive antinuclear demonstrations across Europe and the United States. On December 8, 1987, at a time when worries had been growing about how a nuclear conflagration in Europe might trigger an all-out nuclear exchange between the superpowers, President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty.That historic agreement -- the first to eliminate an entire class of nuclear delivery systems -- banned the deployment of ground-based cruise or ballistic missiles with a range of 500 and 5,500 kilometers and required the destruction of all those then in existence. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Russian Federation inherited the USSR’s treaty obligations and pledged to uphold the INF along with other U.S.-Soviet arms control agreements. In the view of most observers, the prospect of a nuclear war between the two countries practically vanished as both sides made deep cuts in their atomic stockpiles in accordance with already existing accords and then signed others, including the New START, the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty of 2010.Today, however, this picture has changed dramatically. The Obama administration has concluded that Russia has violated the INF treaty by testing a ground-launched cruise missile of prohibited range, and there is reason to believe that, in the not-too-distant future, Moscow might abandon that treaty altogether. Even more troubling, Russia has adopted a military doctrine that favors the early use of nuclear weapons if it faces defeat in a conventional war, and NATO is considering comparable measures in response. The nuclear threshold, in other words, is dropping rapidly.Much of this is due, it seems, to Russian fears about its military inferiority vis-à-vis the West. In the chaotic years following the collapse of the USSR, Russian military spending plummeted and the size and quality of its forces diminished accordingly. In an effort to restore Russia's combat capabilities, President Vladimir Putin launched a multi-year, multi-billion-dollar expansion and modernization program. The fruits of this effort were apparent in the Crimea and Ukraine in 2014, when Russian forces, however disguised, demonstrated better fighting skills and wielded better weaponry than in the Chechnya wars a decade earlier. Even Russian analysts acknowledge, however, that their military in its current state would be no match for American and NATO forces in a head-on encounter, given the West’s superior array of conventional weaponry. To fill the breach, Russian strategic doctrine now calls for the early use of nuclear weapons to offset an enemy’s superior conventional forces.To put this in perspective, Russian leaders ardently believe that they are the victims of a U.S.-led drive by NATO to encircle their country and diminish its international influence. They point, in particular, to the build-up of NATO forces in the Baltic countries, involving the semi-permanent deployment of combat battalions in what was once the territory of the Soviet Union, and in apparent violation of promises made to Gorbachev in 1990 that NATO would not do so. As a result, Russia has been bolstering its defenses in areas bordering Ukraine and the Baltic states, and training its troops for a possible clash with the NATO forces stationed there.This is where the nuclear threshold enters the picture. Fearing that it might be defeated in a future clash, its military strategists have called for the early use of tactical nuclear weapons, some of which no doubt would violate the INF Treaty, in order to decimate NATO forces and compel them to quit fighting. Paradoxically, in Russia, this is labeled a “de-escalation” strategy, as resorting to strategic nuclear attacks on the U.S. under such circumstances would inevitably result in Russia’s annihilation. On the other hand, a limited nuclear strike (so the reasoning goes) could potentially achieve success on the battlefield without igniting all-out atomic war. As Eugene Rumer of the Carnegie Endowment of International Peace explains, this strategy assumes that such supposedly “limited” nuclear strikes “will have a sobering effect on the enemy, which will then cease and desist.”To what degree tactical nuclear weapons have been incorporated into Moscow’s official military doctrine remains unknown, given the degree of secrecy surrounding such matters. It is apparent, however, that the Russians have been developing the means with which to conduct such “limited” strikes. Of greatest concern to Western analysts in this regard is their deployment of the Iskander-M short-range ballistic missile, a modern version of the infamous Soviet-era “Scud” missile (used by Saddam Hussein’s forces during the Iran-Iraq war of 1980-1988 and the Persian Gulf War of 1990-1991). Said to have a range of 500 kilometers (just within the INF limit), the Iskander can carry either a conventional or a nuclear warhead. As a result, a targeted country or a targeted military could never be sure which type it might be facing (and might simply assume the worst). Adding to such worries, the Russians have deployed the Iskander in Kaliningrad, a tiny chunk of Russian territory wedged between Poland and Lithuania that just happens to put it within range of many western European cities.In response, NATO strategists have discussed lowering the nuclear threshold themselves, arguing -- ominously enough -- that the Russians will only be fully dissuaded from employing their limited-nuclear-war strategy if they know that NATO has a robust capacity to do the same. At the very least, what’s needed, some of them claim, is a more frequent inclusion of nuclear-capable or dual-use aircraft in exercises on Russia’s frontiers to “signal” NATO’s willingness to resort to limited nuclear strikes, too. Again, such moves are not yet official NATO strategy, but it’s clear that senior officials are weighing them seriously.Just how all of this might play out in a European crisis is, of course, unknown, but both sides in an increasingly edgy standoff are coming to accept that nuclear weapons might have a future military role, which is, of course, a recipe for almost unimaginable escalation and disaster of an apocalyptic sort. This danger is likely to become more pronounced in the years ahead because both Washington and Moscow seem remarkably intent on developing and deploying new nuclear weapons designed with just such needs in mind.The New Nuclear ArmamentsBoth countries are already in the midst of ambitious and extremely costly efforts to “modernize” their nuclear arsenals. Of all the weapons now being developed, the two generating the most anxiety in terms of that nuclear threshold are a new Russian ground-launched cruise missile (GLCM) and an advanced U.S. air-launched cruise missile (ALCM). Unlike ballistic missiles, which exit the Earth’s atmosphere before returning to strike their targets, such cruise missiles remain within the atmosphere throughout their flight.American officials claim that the Russian GLCM, reportedly now being deployed, is of a type outlawed by the INF Treaty. Without providing specifics, the State Department indicated in a 2014 memo that it had “a range capability of 500 km [kilometers] to 5,500 km,” which would indeed put it in violation of that treaty by allowing Russian combat forces to launch nuclear warheads against cities throughout Europe and the Middle East in a “limited” nuclear war.The GLCM is likely to prove one of the most vexing foreign policy issues the next president will face. So far, the White House has been reluctant to press Moscow too hard, fearing that the Russians might respond by exiting the INF Treaty altogether and so eliminate remaining constraints on its missile program. But many in Congress and among Washington’s foreign policy elite are eager to see the next occupant of the Oval Office take a tougher stance if the Russians don’t halt deployment of the missile, threatening Moscow with more severe economic sanctions or moving toward countermeasures like the deployment of enhanced anti-missile systems in Europe. The Russians would, in turn, undoubtedly perceive such moves as threats to their strategic deterrent forces and so an invitation for further weapons acquisitions, setting off a fresh round in the long-dormant Cold War nuclear arms race.On the American side, the weapon of immediate concern is a new version of the AGM-86B air-launched cruise missile, usually carried by B-52 bombers. Also known as the Long-Range Standoff Weapon (LRSO), it is, like the Iskander-M, expected to be deployed in both nuclear and conventional versions, leaving those on the potential receiving end unsure what might be heading their way. In other words, as with the Iskander-M, the intended target might assume the worst in a crisis, leading to the early use of nuclear weapons. Put another way, such missiles make for twitchy trigger fingers and are likely to lead to a heightened risk of nuclear war, which, once started, might in turn take Washington and Moscow right up the escalatory ladder to a planetary holocaust.No wonder former Secretary of Defense William J. Perry called on President Obama to cancel the ALCM program in a recent Washington Post op-ed piece. “Because they... come in both nuclear and conventional variants,” he wrote, “cruise missiles are a uniquely destabilizing type of weapon.” And this issue is going to fall directly into the lap of the next president.The New Nuclear EraWhoever is elected on November 8th, we are evidently all headed into a world in which Trumpian-style itchy trigger fingers could be the norm. It already looks like both Moscow and Washington will contribute significantly to this development -- and they may not be alone. In response to Russian and American moves in the nuclear arena, China is reported to be developing a “hypersonic glide vehicle,” a new type of nuclear warhead better able to evade anti-missile defenses -- something that, at a moment of heightened crisis, might make a nuclear first strike seem more attractive to Washington. And don’t forget Pakistan, which is developing its own short-range “tactical” nuclear missiles, increasing the risk of the quick escalation of any future Indo-Pakistani confrontation to a nuclear exchange. (To put such “regional” dangers in perspective, a local nuclear war in South Asia could cause a global nuclear winter and, according to one study, possibly kill a billion people worldwide, thanks to crop failures and the like.)And don’t forget North Korea, which is now testing a nuclear-armed ICBM, the Musudan, intended to strike the Western United States. That prompted a controversial decision in Washington to deploy THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) anti-missile batteries in South Korea (something China bitterly opposes), as well as the consideration of other countermeasures, including undoubtedly scenarios involving first strikes against the North Koreans.It’s clear that we’re on the threshold of a new nuclear era: a time when the actual use of atomic weapons is being accorded greater plausibility by military and political leaders globally, while war plans are being revised to allow the use of such weapons at an earlier stage in future armed clashes.As a result, the next president will have to grapple with nuclear weapons issues -- and possible nuclear crises -- in a way unknown since the Cold War era. Above all else, this will require both a cool head and a sufficient command of nuclear matters to navigate competing pressures from allies, the military, politicians, pundits, and the foreign policy establishment without precipitating a nuclear conflagration. On the face of it, that should disqualify Donald Trump. When questioned on nuclear issues in the first debate, he exhibited a striking ignorance of the most basic aspects of nuclear policy. But even Hillary Clinton, for all her experience as secretary of state, is likely to have a hard time grappling with the pressures and dangers that are likely to arise in the years ahead, especially given that her inclination is to toughen U.S. policy toward Russia.In other words, whoever enters the Oval Office, it may be time for the rest of us to take up those antinuclear signs long left to molder in closets and memories, and put some political pressure on leaders globally to avoid strategies and weapons that would make human life on this planet so much more precarious than it already is.Michael T.

Most Bosnian-Americans and their children born in the U.S. would not be now Americans except for the genocidal war sparked 25 years earlier by then-Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic and executed by his supporters, many of them previously only perceived as fringe groups. We understand the damage inflicted upon society when tolerance became a target in what was a country that had previously largely benefited from diversity, much like America. The United States ultimately allied itself in subduing these extremists in the former Yugoslavia and first in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The fascism though has not been sent back under the rock, where it had lived since the defeat of Nazism in WW II. It again has been enabled and taken hold from ISIS to Putin-backed assaults upon Ukraine, but it has also spread to what we knew as the stalwarts of democracy in Western Europe and more notably the U.S. What a Trump Presidency puts at risk now is what most Americans value as our democratic, diverse and free society. Further it would reverse the welcome that then Bosnian refugees received. Immigrants, and not just those labelled unfavorably as Muslims, would be viewed as cultural invaders, abusive free loaders or criminal/political threats. The contributions made by Bosnian-Americans would be trivialized or ignored, from serving with distinction in the U.S. military and law enforcement, to arts and culture to creating jobs as entrepreneurs to doing the hard jobs with quality and pride. When I came to the U.S. as a very young boy in 1967, when very few even knew of a Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), I embraced my American identity one nourishing bite at a time. Now Bosnian-Americans are an integral, integrated and vibrant part of the American mosaic, energizing and adding to our society as a whole as citizens, as voters and as patriots. (Read: ""From Bosnia to U.S., from Refugees to Great Americans"")""Dog Whistles"" that go Beyond what is Audible but Empower Calls to Violence, Ethnic Cleansing:During the bleak years of the wars in the former Yugoslavia I had numerous encounters with Slobodan Milosevic. Compared to Radovan Karadzic or General Ratko Mladic, at least when he spoke off-stage and beyond his election appeals to Serbians, he was viewed by European and US mediators as more reasonable. They heard Milosevic's words in English as genuine to reject the extremists who would commit ethnic cleansing. They, however, could not hear the ""dog whistle"" spoken in Serbian that enabled the most intolerant and brutal within his core constituency. Donald Trump, with whom I have had less direct contact when I worked as investment banker in New York, seeks to be as clever in providing one audible message to the broader public but also a ""dog whistle"" which arouses and enables his most divisive, hateful supporters. As a businessman, Trump is at best embellished as a promoter and at worst someone who built his wealth by cheating others. Some correctly question whether the Trump brand is as false as the VW emission standards. Contradictions are part of our human existence. America's Founding Fathers recognized the dangers of such in the carefully crafted U.S. Constitution that is intended to balance powers between institutions and also dampen personal egos, particularly when contradictions take the turn to hypocrisy. Blinded by Narcissism and the New Inquisition:What is most dangerous about Trump though is his ever more exercised narcissism. He has no commitment or belief in studying the issues or even accepting the advice of those knowledgeable. Ideology is only useful when it appears to agree with his instincts of the moment. Trump has come to believe that he is the smartest man in the room, on every issue, and because his reliance upon intimidate, brutalize or simply lie are superior tactics over any longer-term vision of US strategic priorities. Pope Francis also sees the threat of modern-day ""false prophets"" who see theology as not humanizing but targeting of those who are different. Trump, feeding of a base that seeks the messiah to revert to an America that favored those citizens of certain race, religion, gender, sexual orientation and/or lineage, acts as if he can walk on water, arouse the believers to violence and spark a modern crusade or at least inquisition.Milosevic was more self-aware or perhaps clever. Rather than naked narcissism he employed charisma and what I wrote about as ""Seduction Diplomacy."" Many, perhaps even most within Serbia and Montenegro were not supportive of Milosevic, but they were marginalized or maybe overwhelmed by a core base that was not fooled by Milosevic's appeal but drawn to it feeling that it was OK to voice, vote and act-out bigotry and hate.What many in the U.S. media have done inadvertently is provide an excuse to be a Trump supporter by speaking of struggle or anger created by loss of jobs, income and opportunity. However polls as Gallup, have evidenced that while some truly feel their economic well being shrinking, the core of Trump supporters is economically well-off and tends to live in communities that in-effect are segregated from people who are not like them in skin color or religion... in other words, limited or no diversity. Trump proudly speaks of the support of his ""poorly educated supporters."" This though is only partly about education and also much about core Trump supporters not being exposed to the diversity of perspectives and peoples present in a more cosmopolitan environment or university campus. It is the mentality of a homogeneous village that finds fault even with the new traffic light installed on its main street to deal with the increasing number and diversity of vehicles driving through and by them. How Many Trump Supporters want an Authoritarian America? Pope Francis has implicitly defined the Milosevic and Trump phenomena: ""No tyranny finds support without tapping into our fears,"" Francis said. ""This is key. Hence, all tyranny is terrorist. And when this terror -- which was sown in the peripheries, with the massacres, looting, oppression and injustice -- explodes in centers with different forms of violence, even hateful and cowardly attacks, citizens who still retain some rights are tempted to the false security of physical or social walls.""While many of Trump's voters may not be the ""deplorables"" as labelled by Hillary Clinton, I fear how many of his supporters are driven to march behind him not despite but because of his intolerant even hateful message on ethnicity, race, religion and/or women. When speaking of Trump it is difficult to view it as either Republican or Democratic. In Trump's narcissistic mind it is only about Trump. Bosnia and most importantly Bosnian Americans have had proven friends among Republicans including Senator Bob Dole, Senator John McCain and Congressman Chris Smith. Similarly, Democrats have been strategic allies and/or friends. Hillary Clinton will carry with her to some degree the good and part of the legacy of the Bill Clinton Administration. The Dayton Agreement ended war, and we felt that we had only a choice then of ""good war or bad peace."" America now recognizes that concessions made at the expense of BiH over the last two decades plus, the appeasement of an ever more nationalistic Kremlin, or rationalizing war and peace in terms ethnic/religious divisions, have come back as a resurgent cancer, whether Putin, Ukraine, ISIS or notion of disenfranchised populations in Europe. (See: ""Construction According to Putin's Model, from Bosnia to Europe?"") Trump's America would Lose Respect, Strength and thus be more Likely to be Exploited by Adversary and Seen as Lesser Leader by Allies:US Election 2016 though is much more about the future of the United States. We owe it to vote first with American priorities in mind. Hillary Clinton would be a good, perhaps she can even rise to be a great as well as first woman US President. Hillary is thoughtful, strategic and aware of the mistakes made. Trump cannot admit a mistake. He sees no distinction between any ""Muslim"" label imposed. Refugees/immigrants are risks and not new assets for America. He promotes fellowship with Putin as well as his version of fascist nationalism, and thus also lowers the unique and inclusive American patriotism. Our Bosnian-American experience has made us an electoral, democratic force including in such ""battleground states"" as Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Michigan, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania. We recognize that our bonds with BiH strengthen America economically and politically. BiH can be an ever more critical ally to the US in a world destabilized by a Putin or ISIS or the appeal of fascism. Hillary Clinton has been hounded by various accusations, some more legitimate but most again seeded in bigotry. The Clinton Foundation has worked more admirably alongside partners/donors (including Bill/Melinda Gates, Muhammed Yunus, and governments as United Kingdom, Norway and Qatar) all who have made education, disease eradication and international dialogue as core goals. Most Bosnian-Americans will be focused, as their neighbors, on better jobs, education, health care and a safer America from threats outside or within, bigots of any color to the weapons of word or deed. Trump is more dangerous, even if not as clever. Most around the world see Trump as a uniquely American clown who makes a joke of the principles this great country stands for -- they would laugh if not being so frightened by the prospect of this man with his trigger-finger on the nuclear weapons arsenal of the most powerful country in the world. They rightfully ask is this ""Really"" what America is!"" More sadly though, many see our potential demise as a self-inflicted wound with potentially fatal consequences. The U.S. has set the standard technologically, in media and what defines an inclusive, free and democratic society. No other free society is obliged to copy U.S. democratic institutions. However, many from western Europe to Asia already see Trump as cover for unleashing intolerant and hateful forces within their own countries, sometimes under the guise of democracy, from Germany and the Netherlands to India and Pakistan, and this overwhelmingly undermines America's interests.Trump speaks of strength. However, respect is nurtured and not earned by fear of you as a clown or worse, psychologically unbalanced. Narcissism does not equate to confidence. Respect and strength is developed from thoughtfully evaluated and diligently implemented policy. Trump makes America weaker, more likely to be tested by adversaries, more divided within and less capable of projecting itself from assault at its borders, interests or model as a positive factor globally and for the interests of its own citizens. @MuhamedSacirbeyPHOTO: Daniel X.

55,POLITICS,Obama's Not Happy Pat Toomey Is Using Him In His Campaign Ad,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-pat-toomey_us_581e3e3de4b0d9ce6fbc7e13,"""[C]ourage is telling Pennsylvania voters where you stand on the tough issues, not just the easy ones like background checks.""",2016-11-05,Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) is in a tough reelection race against Democrat Katie McGinty.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/581e4298190000a502c311b6.jpeg?cache=S0biCnUrQe&ops=crop_0_72_3500_2051%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"President Barack Obama criticized Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) Saturday for featuring him in in his latest campaign ad, making clear he does not support the senator’s reelection bid. The ad features Obama speaking outside the White House in 2013, when he praised Toomey and Sen. Joe Manchin (R-W.Va.) for their bipartisan ― but ultimately unsuccessful ― efforts to pass gun control legislation. “That was not easy,” Obama said, praising the senators’ “courage.”The new ad released Friday is airing in the Philadelphia and Pittsburgh cable markets. Watch it below: Obama said in a statement released Saturday afternoon that Toomey did “the right thing” on this one issue but said that doesn’t mean he should be reelected: Pat Toomey may have done the right thing on one vote, but courage is telling Pennsylvania voters where you stand on the tough issues, not just the easy ones like background checks. Pat Toomey won’t tell Pennsylvania voters where he stands on Donald Trump, trying instead to have it both ways by telling different people what he thinks they want to hear. That’s not courage. Voting to shut down the government and against bills to close the terrorist gun loophole isn’t courage. And playing politics with the Supreme Court isn’t courage. I support Katie McGinty for Senate because she will always do the right thing for Pennsylvania families.Toomey is in a tough reelection fight against Democrat Katie McGinty, a former environmental official in the state and in former President Bill Clinton’s administration. The race has become the most expensive Senate contest of all time. The Pennsylvania senator has been trying to pull off a tricky strategy of keeping the Republican base with him, while also trying to pick off some Democratic voters in the blue-leaning state. He has refused to say whether he will vote for GOP nominee Donald Trump for president, for example, unwilling to risk alienating either group. Toomey ― who has one of the most conservative voting records in Congress ― has also been airing other ads featuring praise from Democrats, while simultaneously putting up spots bashing the party’s presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton. “Pat Toomey is proud of his ongoing bipartisan work to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the dangerously mentally ill and we will continue to highlight that record,” Toomey spokesman Ted Kwong said in a statement. “It’s clear this election is a choice between Pat’s record as an independent voice and Katie McGinty’s history of rubber-stamp partisanship and ethics problems.”While Toomey has worked across the aisle on issues like background checks and the opioid epidemic, he has, overall, been a consistent critic of Obama’s agenda and frequently criticizes the president on the campaign trail.Toomey also blamed Obama himself for the failure of the background check legislation, which the White House supported. “I would suggest the administration brought this on themselves,” Toomey said in 2013. “I think the president ran his re-election campaign in a divisive way. He divided Americans. He was using resentment of some Americans toward others to generate support for himself. That was very divisive, that has consequences, that lingers.”Toomey isn’t the only Obama critic to use the president ― whose approval rating continues to rise ― in a campaign ad. Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) recently sent his constituents a mailer featuring words of praise for the congressman from Obama. “Now, that is the definition of chutzpah,” Obama responded. “Here’s a guy who called my administration perhaps the most corrupt in history ― despite the fact that actually we have not had a major scandal in my administration.”HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

56,POLITICS,Senate Races Flooded With Never-Before-Seen Sums Of Super PAC Cash,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/2016-senate-races-super-pacs_us_581cfbf5e4b0d9ce6fbc23be,But nearly $500 million from outside groups may come with a few strings.,2016-11-05,Casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson has given more than $20 million. He wants a ban on online gambling.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/581cfc99150000b700531cdf.jpeg?ops=crop_18_26_4582_2651%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Unprecedented spending by super PACs, dark money nonprofits and other outside groups is swamping Senate races as the battle to control the chamber that votes on Supreme Court nominees enters its final days.Outside group spending has surged past $490 million with four days still to go, surpassing the $400 million dropped on Senate races in 2014. The huge sums have overwhelmed candidates’ efforts, leaving them practically bit players in their own campaigns.In the seven races expected to decide control of the Senate, outside groups have already poured in more money than the candidates, according to a report by the campaign finance reform group Democracy 21. The key contests are being run in Florida, Indiana, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.This is the new normal for campaigns in the post-Citizens United world. In 2010, the Supreme Court opened the door to unlimited electoral spending by corporations and unions so long as they remain ostensibly independent from the candidates they support. A subsequent lower-court ruling extended this decision to individuals, and afterward super PACs were created to serve as vehicles for these unlimited contributions.A system of barely independent unlimited-money groups soon emerged to process giant contributions from billionaires, corporations and unions aiming to influence elections. In this electoral cycle, the biggest actors in the Senate races are two super PACs directly connected to party leaders.Outside Group Spending On Senate Races (2010-2016)Senate Majority PAC is a Democratic entity that was formed by close aides to Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) in 2010. It is slowly being taken over by former aides to Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), who is expected to replace the retiring Reid as the next Democratic leader. The super PAC is the fourth most active outside group, having spent more than $74 million on the 2016 races.The Senate Leadership Fund, recently founded by former aides to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), is even busier. It’s run by Steven Law, who also heads the Karl Rove-founded super PAC American Crossroads and the affiliated nonprofit Crossroads GPS. The Senate Leadership Fund is the third highest spending super PAC in 2016, with $85 million already pumped into the effort to save the Republican majority. (Its nonprofit arm, One Nation, dropped additional tens of millions of dollars on issue ads attacking Democratic Senate candidates from 2015 into the spring of 2016. That spending is not included in the totals mentioned here.)The two opposing Senate super PACs rely on massive donations from a small pool of mega-donors. So far, donors giving more than $500,000 to super PACs in the 2016 election have combined to contribute over $1 billion. That’s a record that will only increase when final donation totals are revealed after the election.The biggest donor paying to elect Senate Republicans is casino oligarch Sheldon Adelson. The billionaire and his wife Miriam have donated at least $20 million to the Senate Leadership Fund; $1.5 million to Granite State Solutions, a super PAC that only supports Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.); and $1.2 million to Arizona Grassroots Action, a super PAC that only supports Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). Adelson backs Israel’s current right-wing government, opposes the Iran nuclear deal and has casually mused about using nuclear weapons as a means of applying pressure on Iran. He is also a major proponent of banning online gambling, which would presumably help his business’s bottom line. Republicans in both the House and Senate have introduced exactly the legislation against online gambling that he would like.There are other major donors who have their own issues before Congress.Hedge fund billionaire Paul Singer has given $4 million to the Senate Leadership Fund. He has also pumped money into the parade of super PACs supporting individual candidates. These donations include $750,000 to the Fighting for Ohio Fund, which backs Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio); $400,000 to Independent Voice for Illinois, which supports Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.); and $350,000 to Arizona Grassroots Action for McCain.In May, Singer and a handful of his fellow billionaires launched a new lobbying group called CIRCA to further entrench their power in the nation’s capital. The group is designed to fight on behalf of wealthy activist investors like Singer, Carl Icahn, Dan Loeb and Bill Ackman.McConnell’s super PAC has also received large contributions from fossil fuel energy corporations fighting to roll back environmental regulations and forestall any new effort to tackle the threat of climate change. Chevron, the oil and gas giant that ranks 14th on the Fortune 500, donated $2 million. Coal company Devon Energy gave $750,000, electric utility company NextEra Energy gave $750,000 and fracking giant Continental Resources gave $250,000. All have lobbyists working to influence Congress as well.Zuffa LLC, the parent company of Ultimate Fighting Championship, is another donor with lobbying interests. Zuffa donated $500,000 to the Senate Leadership Fund, while owners Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta gave $250,000 each. Another $500,000 came from the Fertitta brothers’ company Station Casinos. Zuffa is currently lobbying against extending to individual mixed martial arts competitors certain protections that Congress gave to boxers in 2000.The largest donation to the Senate Leadership Fund was $11 million from its sister nonprofit, One Nation. That’s the single biggest contribution ever from a dark money group to a super PAC. The ultimate source of the money, the entity that gave it to One Nation, remains undisclosed.On the smaller end of contributions, the tobacco company Altria donated $75,000 to the Senate Leadership Fund ― even as it has worked with lawmakers to pass legislation exempting e-cigarettes from Food and Drug Administration oversight.Senate Republicans have also been boosted by Freedom Partners Action Fund, a super PAC run by the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch. Charles Koch is the top donor to Freedom Partners Action Fund at $6 million.The biggest donor to the Democrats’ Senate Majority PAC is NewsWeb Corporation chairman Fred Eychaner, who has given $11 million so far. He’s a big supporter of the LGBTQ community.Other mega-donors to the Democratic group include some familiar names. James Simons, a New York-based hedge fund billionaire, gave $5 million. Billionaire and GOP bête noire George Soros pitched in $1.5 million, while his son Alexander Soros gave $2.25 million. Thomas Murphy, the father of Florida Senate candidate Patrick Murphy (D), gave $2 million. Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Apple CEO Steve Jobs and a major proponent of charter schools, donated $1.5 million. And perhaps the largest collective contribution from a group with a Washington agenda is the $17.9 million given by labor unions to Senate Majority PAC.Like its Republican counterpart, the Democratic group has also received contributions from corporations with interests in Washington. There was $175,000 from U.S. Sugar Corporation and $100,000 from Florida Crystals Company, both of which lobby to maintain their government subsidies and fight back against negative stories about the health effects of sugar. There was also $150,000 from the food and beverage company Delaware North, which lobbies on tax issues. The Entertainment Software Association, the lobbying arm of the video game industry, donated $100,000 to endorse a hang-out space at the Democratic National Convention.For the most part, Democratic Senate candidates have centralized their super PAC funding through Senate Majority PAC. But Republican candidates also boast their own personal super PACs, often run by their former aides.The pro-Ayotte Granite State Solutions is the only one of these groups to receive most of its money ― $19.6 million ― from the Senate Leadership Fund. The others rely on their own sets of donors.The second best-financed personal super PAC among Senate Republicans is the pro-Portman Fighting for Ohio Fund. But its largest donor is shrouded in mystery.One dark money group, FreedomVote Inc., has given the Portman super PAC nearly $2 million. Other dark money donations include $135,000 from Citizens for a Working America, $90,000 from The Government Integrity Fund, $75,000 from the American Policy Coalition, and $80,000 from Americans United for Values, a super PAC funded entirely by the American Policy Coalition.All of these dark money groups are connected to the same Ohio-based consultant: David Langdon. The secretive Langdon was described in Politico as a rock-ribbed social conservative. His groups have also given $175,000 to the pro-McCain Arizona Grassroots Action.Another major supporter of the Portman super PAC is controversial venture capitalist Peter Thiel. The Donald Trump supporter gave $1 million.In Wisconsin, Sen. Ron Johnson (R) is backed by two super PACs, Reform America Fund and Let America Work. The top donor to Reform America Fund is Diane Hendricks, the richest person in the state, who gave $5.4 million. She is also a staunch supporter of Gov. Scott Walker (R), who advocates the traditional conservative agenda of lower taxation, less regulation and no more collective bargaining rights for unions.Reform America Fund received another $100,000 from tobacco giant Reynolds American. Like Altria, Reynolds has lobbied Congress to pass legislation ensuring that e-cigarettes avoid regulation. The North Carolina-based company has also contributed $100,000 to Grow NC Strong, a super PAC supporting Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.).Prosperity for Pennsylvania is the super PAC supporting Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) in his challenging bid for re-election. The coal companies Murray Energy and Consol Energy, both with hired lobbyists in Washington, have given $110,000 and $100,000, respectively, to the group.There is currently only one super PAC backing a single Democratic Senate candidate. Floridians for a Strong Middle Class supports Patrick Murphy. Its top donors are his father with $450,000 and his father’s company, Coastal Construction, with $300,000.HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

57,POLITICS,Barack Obama Warns That A Donald Trump Presidency Would Be 'Damaging For The World',Carla Herreria,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-bill-maher-real-time-interview_us_581d1591e4b0e80b02ca30d1,The president told Bill Maher the choice this election should be clear: Hillary Clinton for president.,2016-11-05,"“Look, if I watched Fox News, I wouldn’t vote for me either,"" President Barack Obama said during his appearance on ""Real Time with Bill Maher.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/581d6801190000a502c310b3.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Barack Obama finally fulfilled Bill Maher’s long-held wish: He appeared on the comedian’s “Real Time” show while he’s still president of the United States.The interview, which was taped in the White House on Wednesday and aired Friday night, showed a more serious Maher. The host replaced his signature tongue-in-cheek banter with an astute discussion on issues ranging from the resurgence of socialism, healthcare reform and military spending to religion, genetically modified food and drug laws.During the nearly 40-minute interview, the conversation unsurprisingly turned to politics and the upcoming election, with Obama warning that the stakes are high.It’s becoming increasingly difficult to get people enough information so they can be equipped to make the right decisions, according to the president.“Look, if I watched Fox News, I wouldn’t vote for me either,” Obama said.“The choice in this election should be really clear,” said the president, as Maher, an outspoken supporter of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, agreed.All the progress made under his administration are at risk should GOP nominee Donald Trump be elected president ― including strides on climate change and the Paris agreement, health care insurance and immigration reform, Obama warned. “Anybody sitting on the sidelines right now or deciding to engage in a protest vote, that’s a vote for Trump,” he said. “That would be badly damaging for this country and it would be damaging for the world.”Maher and Obama agreed that there was a problem with overwhelming media ― as Obama says, “800 stations” and “all these websites” ― clouding the lines between truth and lies.“How do we create a space,” the president asked, “where truth gets eyeballs and it’s entertaining and we can build a common conversation around it?”During the wide-ranging interview, Maher questioned whether it was time the federal government caught up with progressive states on marijuana laws. Obama first joked about being an ex-cigarette smoker. (“Ex?” Maher asked. “Yeah,” Obama replied, with a wink.”) Then he became serious, as he turned the discussion into one about opioid substance abuse, saying that the legalization of marijuana is not a “panacea.”“It is indisputable that right now the biggest drug crisis we have is with opioids, many of which are legal and ravaging entire communities across the country,” the president said.Maher also pressed the president on atheism, an issue that the comedian has openly discussed on his show. But Obama questioned whether there was an “active persecution of atheists.” “We should foster a culture in which people’s private religious beliefs, including atheists and agnostics, are respected,” he added.Obama’s appearance on “Real Time” comes nearly a year after Maher begged his audience in January to help him get the president on the show before his time was up in the oval office. He even started a petition that gathered more than 320,000 signatures.

They Think Trump And Clinton Don't.,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/top-issues-poll-economy_us_581e285ce4b0e80b02ca6957,The issues voters are hearing about the most this year aren't their top priorities.,2016-11-05,"U.S. presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton attend campaign rallies in Ambridge, Pennsylvania, October 10, 2016 and Manchester, New Hampshire U.S., October 24, 2016 in a combination of file photos.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/581e2bd9190000a502c3117d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As atypical as the 2016 election has been, Americans are heading to the ballot box with the same top concern they normally have: the economy.The public, though, believes neither major party nominee shares that priority, with Hillary Clinton instead largely attacking Donald Trump’s character and Trump devoting much of his time to anti-immigration rhetoric.Asked in a new HuffPost/YouGov survey to pick the two issues most important to them in this election, 43 percent of Americans named the economy. Health care, at 29 percent, and nominating justices to the Supreme Court, at 21 percent, took a relatively distant second and third place. Fewer than a fifth of respondents selected any of the remaining eight options, including immigration, foreign policy and each candidate’s personal qualities.Both Americans who’d rather see Clinton win, as well as those who’d rather see a Trump victory, put the economy first, although the first group’s second-biggest concern is health care while the latter names immigration as a second priority. Both groups named the Supreme Court as the third concern.Prompted to select the two issues that each nominee has spent the most time talking about, 32 percent said that Clinton had focused on the candidates’ personal qualities, and 26 percent that she’d focused on social issues. Just 18 percent named the economy as one of her main planks. A majority of Americans, 53 percent, said that Trump’s campaign had focused mostly on immigration, with 27 percent saying he’d mostly addressed the candidates’ personal qualities. Only 23 percent thought that the economy was among the GOP nominee’s top two issues.Supporters of both candidates were more likely to see their chosen nominee as focusing on the economy and their rival as focusing on personality.Americans who wanted to see Clinton win believed that she had mostly emphasized the economy (34 percent) and social issues (29 percent), while those who wanted to see Trump win said she concentrating on personal qualities (44 percent) and social issues (33 percent).Trump was seen by his supporters as focusing on immigration (55 percent) and the economy (43 percent), while those who’d prefer Clinton believed Trump was spending the most time on immigration (57 percent) and personal qualities (40 percent).The perception that much of this year’s campaign has revolved around character attacks is especially out of step with Americans’ concerns. Clinton and her surrogates have repeatedly advanced the argument that Trump is temperamentally unfit to serve as commander in chief, while Trump and his allies have devoted much of their time to attacking Clinton as corrupt.Just 8 percent of Americans, however, consider each candidate’s personal qualities to be a top concern. And in a separate HuffPost/YouGov poll, conducted earlier in October, 78 percent said it was more important this year to pick a candidate with better positions on the issues they cared about, while only 15 percent said the candidates’ personal qualities were more important.As past elections have shown, a party or candidate who is perceived as focusing on relatively unimportant issues can pay a price.In 2014, a HuffPost/YouGov poll taken just before the midterm elections found that voters, overwhelmingly worried about the economy, thought Republican candidates shared their concerns, but believed Democrats were prioritizing social and women’s issues. Republicans went on to win the election in a wave.The public’s self-assessments of what matters to them most should probably be taken with a grain of salt ― few people understand exactly what combination of factors drives them to support the candidates that they do, and “caring about the issues” perhaps sounds more virtuous than getting dragged down into weighing each candidate’s personal attributes.But the idea that Clinton and Trump’s political positions matter more to voters than their character lines up with the lockstep partisanship that’s defined much of this campaign. Americans say they have more common interests with the rest of their political party than they do with people who share their religious beliefs, ethnicity or financial standing. Even in mid-October, when a series of high-profile Republican officeholders defected from Trump in the wake of a leaked vulgar video, more than three-quarters of Republican voters still said they supported him.Currently, according to HuffPost Pollster’s average of head-to-head surveys, about 89 percent of Democrats plan to vote for Clinton, with close to 87 percent of Republicans voting for Trump. With third party candidates such as Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson included, Clinton’s share of the vote remains at 89 percent of Democrats, with Trump taking about 83 percent of Republicans.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted in November among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

Abdiqadir Hussein, a police officer, told Reuters the explosion had occurred near the parliament building, while another police officer, Major Hussein Nur, said the car bomb hit a military vehicle at a junction checkpoint.“2 soldiers died and 5 others were injured,” Nur said, adding police, military and security forces were on the scene when the attack occurred.Al Shabaab, which once ruled much of Somalia, wants to topple the Western-backed government in Mogadishu and drive out African AMISOM peacekeepers made up of soldiers from Kenya, Djibouti, Uganda, Ethiopia and other African nationsThe group’s radio station Andalus said a suicide car bomb had been driven by “a mujahid” into Sayidka junction “where a convoy of the apostate government security forces were passing.”Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Musab, al Shabaab’s military operations spokesman told Reuters the group had killed 17 soldiers and injured more than 30 others in the attack.The group usually gives far lower numbers of casualties on its side and much higher death tolls for the security forces.Witnesses said security forces had sealed off the area and nearby roads were blocked following the bombing.Much of Somalia has been in a state of lawlessness and chaos since the early 1990s following the toppling of military dictator Mohamed Siad Barre.A central government backed by the west and AMISOM has tried to restore order and rebuild but it has struggled under relentless attacks by al Shabaab.

Increased Latino voter participation could turn what has been a swing megastate into a blue megastate.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/581d0e05190000a304c31036.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"KISSIMMEE, Fla. ― If the Republican Party’s challenge in winning the White House could be boiled down to a single image, it might be the 2-foot-by-3-foot sign in front of a polling place in this Central Florida city.“VOTACION ADELANTADA,” it reads, and underneath: “24 de Octubre de 2016 – 6 de Noviembre de 2016.”It’s not the Spanish wording per se ― there is an English version, too. What should be alarming for Republicans is the sign’s location: Not Miami, or even Tampa, but Osceola County, which until not long ago was home primarily to cattle ranchers ― and voted like it.Today, the county is majority Latino, thanks in part to large numbers of Puerto Rican migrants moving to Central Florida. Unlike Hispanic immigrants, Puerto Ricans are already U.S. citizens, and can register to vote the day they step off the plane.And this election, perhaps because of Republican nominee Donald Trump, they seem to be doing precisely that. Of the early votes cast by Friday, close to one-third of the Hispanic voters had never voted in an election before. And polling makes clear that they are overwhelmingly voting for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. “That, my friends, is the definition of a surge,” said Steve Schale, the Democratic strategist who helped win the state twice for President Barack Obama and has been closely analyzing the early voting numbers in Florida for two weeks.The looming danger for Republicans in this is clear. Republicans once were able to count on California, Texas and Florida in presidential contests. Then it was only Texas and Florida. A Clinton win in the Sunshine State on Tuesday could confirm the start of an era where Democrats head into presidential contests able to count on three of the mega-states ― California, New York and Florida ― with Republicans having only Texas.There are 46 other states and the District of Columbia, of course, but the four big ones account for a total of 151 electoral votes ― more than a quarter of the total available.“It reduces the math to a tiny group, but it’s a useful group,” said Ruy Teixeira, a demographer with the liberal Center for American Progress think tank. “If Florida is gone, that only leaves Texas.”And that means that an electoral map that already was starting to lean in favor of Democrats would tilt that way even more drastically. “It’s not like a coin flip anymore. It’s like a weighted coin,” Teixeira said.Clinton’s campaign, of course, is doing everything it can to make that a reality. For months, Democratic staff and volunteers have been registering tens of thousands of new Latino voters all over the state, but with a particular focus in the Central Florida counties, where migration from Puerto Rico has been most intense.And on Sunday, the final day of early voting, the campaign is putting an exclamation point on that effort with a visit to Kissimmee by a Clinton surrogate who is nearly as popular with Latinos as he is with African Americans: Obama himself.None of this should come as a surprise to Republican leaders. In fact, the nation’s demographic change was a central theme of the party’s post-mortem of 2012 nominee Mitt Romney’s loss to Obama.The “Growth and Opportunity Project” singled out the anti-immigrant tone that some Republican candidates used in the primaries, hurting the party’s efforts to reach out to Latinos in the general election. “If Hispanics think we do not want them here, they will close their ears to our policies,” the report stated.In the summer of 2013, party chairman Reince Priebus excoriated Romney’s suggestion during one primary debate that undocumented immigrants would leave the country on their own because of the harsh policies his administration would impose. “Using the word ‘self-deportation’ ― what a horrific comment to make,” Priebus said at a Republican National Committee meeting in Boston.Priebus worked to implement recommendations that the party start community-based recruitment efforts in Hispanic communities years before an election, not weeks. The party’s effort in Colorado was considered a model for what was possible nationwide, and was credited with helping then-Rep. Corey Gardner unseat incumbent Democratic Sen. Mark Udall in 2014. All that, of course, was before Trump. He announced his campaign with a speech that featured his generalization that those coming across the border illegally were rapists and criminals (although he did allow that some might be good people). His central policy proposal was building a massive wall along the Mexican border, and he called for a “deportation force” to round up and get rid of 11 million undocumented immigrants and their families.Stuart Stevens, a GOP strategist who worked for Romney in 2012 and with President George W. Bush before that, said the party under Trump has moved in exactly the wrong direction.“It’s like the National Institutes of Health put out a study that says chemotherapy works. And we say, no let’s go with leeches,” he said. “Guys, I don’t think that leeches are working.” It didn’t have to be this way, Stevens said, pointing to divergent paths taken by the largest states, California and Texas. Both had surging Mexican American populations in the 1990s.In California, Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, contemplating a presidential run in 1996, threw his weight behind a ballot referendum cracking down on illegal immigrants. Fifteen hundred miles to the east, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, also a Republican, avoided the confrontational rhetoric, and instead worked to bring Mexican Americans into the fold.“It’s a perfect case study,” Stevens said. “You have two big states. One the patient died, the other the patient lived.”Yet even in Texas, Trump’s rhetoric may be undoing that work. Latinos have been voting in huge numbers, finally delivering the sort of turnout that Democrats have longed for to start making the state more competitive for them. Polls there show Trump with a comfortable lead, but considerably smaller than enjoyed by previous Republican nominees.And in Florida, where demographic changes had already turned a safe Republican state into a battleground, Trump’s nomination may allow Democrats to consolidate Latino loyalty for years to come.“If what happens in 2016 with Latinos and other non-white voters is the same thing that happened with African Americans in 1964, Republicans aren’t going to win a presidential election for generations,” Stevens said.In Kissimmee this week, voters arriving at the Robert Guevera Community Center in a residential neighborhood of modest concrete-block homes seemed to confirm Stevens’ fears.The building is named after Osceola County’s first county commissioner to have been born in Puerto Rico. Just about every one of the dozens who dropped by during the lunch hour to cast their ballots was Latino ― and had come to vote for Clinton.“I wouldn’t vote for that man,” said Anjanette Zapata, 43, a surgical tech still in her scrubs. “No way.”If there is a silver lining in this for Republicans, it could be this: Whether Trump wins or loses, the roadmap for making things right with Latinos is right there on the shelf. The autopsy from 2013.“Hey, just that roll that out again,” Teixeira said.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

You don’t need to listen to what Hillary says about Trump, or what I say about Trump,” he added. “You just need to listen to Trump. If you can do that, and still consider voting for him... well…”Martin, whose Song of Ice and Fire book series was adapted into the HBO fantasy epic “Game of Thrones,” said he reached his damning conclusion after examining the rival campaigns’ political ads in New Mexico, where he lives.The acclaimed author pointed out how the Trump attack ads against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton were “made of assertion, innuendo, and name-calling,” but ultimately had “no substance.” He found Clinton’s attack ads, however, to be “much more truthful.”“Hillary does not need to use the sort of hoary attack ads that Trump is using,” Martin added. “She only needs to present him as he is, and let his own words condemn them.”Martin admitted the brash businessman did have an advantage over previous presidential candidates who’d lost the election over “trivial” and “insignificant” things.“[Trump] has said the vilest things any presidential candidate has said since George Wallace, and he’s rising in the polls,” he wrote. “He has boasted that he could shoot someone dead on Fifth Avenue and still not lose any votes.

But it’s hard not to think of Trump himself when the pope talks about walls. “No tyranny can be sustained without exploiting our fears. This is clear,” Francis said at the event, speaking in Spanish. “All tyranny is terrorist. And when that terror, ignited in the peripheries with massacres, looting, oppression and injustice, explodes in the centers in the form of violence, including with hateful and cowardly intent, the citizens who still have some rights are tempted by the false security of walls, physical or social — walls that close some in and banish others.”In the past, Francis has been a little more blunt with his thoughts:“A person who only thinks about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian,” Francis told reporters in February.In response to the criticism at the time, Trump called the holy man “disgraceful” and accused Mexico of using him as a pawn.

But Van Jones is already thinking about the day after ― when, regardless of the outcome, Americans will have to pick up the pieces and move forward together peacefully.At least, that’s the premise of the CNN contributor and progressive activist’s new Facebook video series, “The Messy Truth.” For the first episode, released on Friday, Jones traveled to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, the site the Civil War’s bloodiest battle. Jones said he was trying to prevent what he calls the “#NextCivilWar” by engaging with a family supporting Donald Trump in their living room.“I feel like we’ve gotten this thing in America now, where we talk about each other, we never talk to each other,” Jones says, explaining the reason for having the conversation in the first place.“We’re here in Gettysburg, where there was a civil war because Americans couldn’t work it out,” Jones went on. “And I’m worried that we’re gonna have another civil war ― or is this a civil war?” One family member agreed that the country stood on the brink of an armed conflict, claiming he knew people willing to take up arms if Hillary Clinton was elected, even if he wasn’t willing to do so himself.“A lot of it’s gonna rely on the way this election ends up,” the man said. “Hillary gets in, there could very well be a civil war.”From there, the conversation turned more substantive ― if tense at times ― covering issues like regulation, trade deals and immigration.Kimberly Fean Corradetti, the host who welcomed Jones into the house, lamented that Americans without a college degree could no longer get decent-paying manufacturing jobs.“These jobs have left us within the last 25 to 30 years ― they’re gone ― because so much federal regulation has strangled business ― strangled ‘em,” she said.Then Jones confronted his hosts with the elephant in the room ― race ― and specifically Trump’s race-baiting rhetoric, including his comments calling Mexicans “rapists.”“So he’s a horrible speaker,” Corradetti said, adding that Latino immigrants offended by Trump’s comments calling Mexicans “rapists” should “toughen up.”“No, you don’t have the right to tell someone else how to deal with the pain that they’re going through,” Jones responded. “If you say, ‘You should have a thicker skin,’ if you say, ‘You have got to get over yourself, I’m gonna hear that as, ‘This person does not respect me, does not understand me, does not know what I’ve gone through.’”HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

The GOP quickly translated this electoral success into majority control of the Supreme Court. Indeed, less than two years out from the first of these presidential victories, five of the nine sitting justices had been appointed by Republican presidents. The party maintained its Court majority for 45 years. In February of this year, Justice Antonin Scalia’s death reduced the number of Republican-appointed justices to four for the first time since June 1970. This loss of control has understandably provoked some measure of distress on the part of Republican political elites, several of whom have made increasingly outlandish promises regarding their determination to reverse this loss. The Supreme Court, of course, is not designed to be a representative institution. Its justices are not elected, and their role, at least in theory, is to enforce the law as written, not to enact policy in accord with popular will. However, as both President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have emphasized, many of the constitutional questions that reach the Court lack clear answers in black-letter law; as such, it is important for the Court’s membership to reflect the rich diversity of the American people. Political actors have recognized this fact throughout the Court’s history. For much of this history, the debate focused on geographic and later religious diversity. The white South insisted on full representation (indeed, overrepresentation) prior to the Civil War, and westerners demanded inclusion after the War. Later, Catholics and then Jews won consistent representation on the Court, and later still, African Americans and women. Most recently, President Obama’s appointment of Sonia Sotomayor added Latinos to the list of Americans who might see themselves reflected on the Court. The judicial appointment mechanism designed by the framers of the Constitution provides for a Court that is relatively insulated from ordinary political pressures, such that the justices will have the wherewithal to enforce constitutional principle even when doing so is unpopular. But this mechanism also creates an electoral connection, albeit an indirect one, between the Court and the people. Under Article II of the Constitution, the justices are appointed by the president, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Since presidents and senators are themselves elected, this process has typically ensured that the set of views entrenched on the Court evolves over time in accord with shifting popular sentiment. In recent decades, however, this connection seems to have broken down. From 1992 through 2012, Democratic candidates won the popular vote in five out of six presidential elections. Twenty-four years on from Bill Clinton’s initial victory, this electoral success has still not produced a Democratic majority on the Court. If Hillary Clinton is elected president and Democrats capture majority control of the Senate, they will surely find a way to confirm Merrick Garland and/or a replacement nominee made by President Clinton herself, despite promises of all-out obstruction from several Republican senators in recent weeks. If Clinton is elected, but Republicans maintain control of the Senate, all bets are off, with the prospect of Republican intransigence ensuring that Democratic electoral victories still do not produce a Democratic Court, and that the Court itself is forced to operate shorthanded for five full years. If Donald Trump is elected president and Republicans maintain control of the Senate, we are likely to see a GOP majority on the Court cemented for many years to come. After all, the current Court includes four Republican-appointed justices, one vacancy, and two Democratic appointees (Justices Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg) who are 78 and 83 years old, respectively. If Donald Trump is elected president and Democrats capture the Senate, Democratic Senate leaders would be well within their rights in responding to all-out Republican obstructionism by confirming Judge Garland in January, once the newly elected senators have been seated on January 3, which is more than two weeks before President Trump himself would be sworn in. Republican elites would predictably cry foul, but it will be hard to credit these complaints as anything other than anguish at losing control of an institution that they see as their fiefdom, but that in truth belongs to the American people as a whole.

For this reason I would not normally write to influence a U.S. election. But this election is exceptional. In an age of nuclear weapons, the primary task of any U.S. president is to make sure we all stay alive. It has been like this since the 1950s, since the Cold War led to heavy nuclear armament. The public library in downtown Lansing (MI), the city where I live, still has the signs of a nuclear shelter. Those Cold War shelters were useless, they would not have saved anyone, but at least they gave people the feeling that there was something they could do even if this wasn't really true. The task of the U.S. president is not only to keep U.S. citizens alive, but to keep us all alive. When I write ""all"", I mean ""all"", not just Americans, but all people across the world. Which is why I feel justified in writing. There were moments during the Cold War when all people alive at the time came very close to dying. The 1963 Cuba crisis was one, but there were times in the early 1980 as well. Not all U.S. presidents (or the leaders of other countries with nuclear weapons) were equally responsible in their handling of nuclear security. It is something to consider very seriously during an election. Both candidates may have flaws on the security front. It may be true, as some people say, that Mrs. Clinton's suggestion of a no-fly zone in Syria poses a risk. Mr. Trump, however, does not have any significant knowledge or experience of relations between states, nor does he even show a willingness to learn or to accept advice. But states are not companies. If a company goes bankrupt, it can be restructured. With countries it is very different: you have to be careful all the time. And from nuclear war, God forbid, there is no return. I believe it would be reckless in the extreme to vote for Mr. Trump. Mrs. Clinton has extensive experience as Secretary of State. The likelihood that she knows how far she can go with Russia or China is so much better than Mr. Trump's. In a democracy, all are responsible. That is the whole idea of democracy. As a European I know that democracies can fail. The U.S. may be the oldest democracy but it can also fail. Votes do have consequences. If you look at a map of who voted for Hitler in 1930s Germany, you see the highest numbers in the provinces east of Berlin. Those provinces are now not even part of Germany any more: they have become part of Poland. All Germans who lived there were expelled by the Soviets at the end of the Second World War. These people were left with nothing. When they voted in 1932 they may not have thought it'd make a huge difference to their lives, but it sure did. It may feel all right to vote for someone who promises an alternative when things are bad. I feel some sympathy for Trump supporters because I believe it is mostly a protest movement of not-so-rich people for whom the system isn't working and who want an alternative. I also feel that the institutions that should guide and warn them, such as schools, news media, political parties and churches, have pretty much failed them for all sorts of reasons. But going by emotions is never the best way to responsible action. Voting is a way of taking responsibility. Americans, please vote responsibly and the world will thank you for it. "

November 5, 2016As election day approaches, two images surface in my imagination. The first is of my mother, born in 1920 to Swedish immigrants, who delighted in election day. “I voted today and no one tried to stop me,” she said every time. The second is of my neighbor here in San Francisco, Ryan. When our polling place was the entrance area at the Starbuck’s around the corner, he used to come with his two, then small, children and vote. I often came in while he was treating his boys to an after-voting snack. So there we were, sharing a neighborhood and sharing citizenship. Ryan and his boys in San Francisco connected by this public liturgy, this civic sacrament to Margaret, and her children in Iowa, all Americans. I am comforted by these images of my mother and Ryan and me attending our American form of “going to church.” It is particularly comforting during this election when what should have been sacramental, communitarian actions have devolved into mob actions that destroy our shared American experience. Instead of animating and stabilizing and widening the trusses that support our common life, Trump’s “speeches” (I hesitate to place Trump’s jabbering into the hallowed category with Washington’s Farewell, Clinton’s words at the Oklahoma City Memorial Service or Obama’s talk on race), deny that there is any common life, any shared human dignity. Trump does not address a community; only a collection of aggrieved individuals. He speaks not to audiences but to mobs. And those mobs want no part of my American landscape where boys in San Francisco with glossy, black locks remind me of pale, blonde kids similarly initiated into the practice of voting. Our politics have been invested with this contagion. We will have to exterminate it. It will take vigilant work but we do have the tools. We have the political sacraments and doctrines that we can use to disinfect the spreading rot that these mobs have bred. Lest “sacrament” remain a kind of “inside baseball” Catholic term, St. Augustine still provides a good definition: a visible sign of an invisible reality. I wear my “I Voted!” sticker with pride because it is a teeny sacrament of my citizenship. It is a visible sign of my relationship to our Constitution and to the identity I share with all Americans. Have you worn yours? People smile, give a wave, connect, and tell you, “I voted too!” Like left-over ashes as Lent begins, that sticker is a lapidary signal that invites community. Our desire for community is not arbitrary. We are wired for community; we are on the alert to belong just as I am fitted to make the connection between a father and sons at the polling place and my own mother and her children. And it isn’t just the belonging that draws us; it is the shared values, shared language, and shared experience. We humans live in a constant pivot between how we think about our experience and how we express that thinking. The Jesuit theologian Bernard Lonergan called that process “appropriation.” That is, he described how we navigate our self-awareness to “grasp” our own personal identity. We don’t simply develop into human persons; we make all manner of decisions that massage us into who we are. Sacraments are implements for this grasping, this appropriation, for the pivot between our inner life and our outer-life, our expressed identity. The most robust sacraments rise to the level called liturgy: “the public work of the people.”We witnessed liturgy on Tuesday in Cleveland. With rally caps, and colors and singing, and standing up for the entire game, we celebrated our nation's great sport. I am not the first one to compare a ball-park to a church. That said, during this election that has been enslaved to personal selfishness by a gluttonous narcissist, it is worth drawing attention to the connection between public political actions and public spiritual (religious) actions. They are deeply related. They spring from the same humane impulses. The voting sticker, the ashes to begin Lent, the rally caps on the heads of young and old alike are signs of the affiliations that we run to when we want to express our deepest, best selves. Community is the playground of goodness; mobs the wasteland of malice. Affiliation has also been thick on my mind this election, especially when the discussion turns to the “Millennials” or “Generation X’ers.” They are often described as “unaffiliated” or “nones.” I spend my days with them and I do not find them so. Indeed, I find such a description disrespectful and condescending. When I see them, as I do in their Santa Clara gear in class at Santa Clara, I am reminded of the same when I worked at Notre Dame. Obviously they go to SCU but they also want to express it, to affiliate with their academic home. Lots of silly ink has been spilled about the escape from religious affiliation as though the church, the mosque, and the synagogue were antiquated, dried-out places that stifle our spirits. How pop; how silly; how uninformed; how spirituality illiterate. Certainly there are churches and mosques and synagogues where the practice has become stale but that is a function of implementation. A poor institutional expression does not mean that institutions are inherently useless. And look what un-affiliation has done to our politics: it has created mobs. Un-affiliation, where the community answers to no shared wisdom, allows the public-preacher to spew hatred that masquerades as policy. Just as sacraments have political forms, so do doctrines. Doctrines are the conceptual trusses of a shared identity. They are the truth-claims that gathered communities make about the reality that they share. Our Constitution contains its own “doctrines” calling them “truths.” They are well-crafted discursive anchors that stabilize our form of self-government. In religious institutions, doctrines function to translate the community’s understanding of God’s character into specific historical actions. Christians and Jews and Muslims answer to their tradition’s teachings about God’s relationship to all reality. If I asked the woman I see in the grocery store with ashes on her head, she can tell me what doctrine is being expressed in that public sign. Doctrine has gotten a bad name as though it is a collection of rigid ideas written by power-hungry men. Far from it. Doctrine means “teaching” and if we are anything, we are the teachable creatures. We first open our eyes hungry to learn, yearning to be taught, listening to hear the familiar voices un-muffled at our birth. Of course our world is saturated with bad practitioners of teaching. But it is also gloriously alive with rich teachers. Did Ms. Obama not lately take us all to school about human dignity and our American values? The answer to poor teaching is not to burn down the school but to renew it, to enrich it precisely by affiliating with it. The response to un-affiliation is not to praise it as though this new crop of persons knows something about community life that previous generations have not discovered. Just as it has always been, un-affiliation is merely a signal that our institutions, like all things human require intentional care and constant renewal. Without institutional affiliation our humanity shrinks. Look what has happened without a strong institutional Republican Party. Because the wise leaders relinquished their teaching role, a viper moved into the vacant space. If we have learned anything from this nominee it is that communities matter; affiliation unmoored from liturgy and doctrine is dangerous. We affiliate because we know we must answer to the human community writ large, including our earliest sisters and brothers, the ones who discovered the itch to create. They knew that the animals whose images they painted could not engineer the lighting as they did nor could they source and craft the ancient art supplies that mark but an early step in human liturgy. They knew they did not share all the features of the animal figures they recreated on caves deep in the earth. But they knew they shared some features. Herding, hunger, as well as violence and fear. When our humanity emerged so did the conundrum that we still face: just what is it we share with the herds and flocks and swarms? Are we simply rough beasts? Is the only difference that some of our appetites are insatiable, like the search for knowledge or love or beauty? Whence those longings? How is our hunger for food and safety related to our hunger for joy and relationship? So what did they do? They affiliated; they created communities, institutions. And in turn, those communities worked out wisdom in both conceptually anchored doctrines and imaginatively anchored rituals. And here we are, a long way from Lascaux, still making use of the same scaffold for the same puzzles of human existence, unless of course, we ignore the wisdom, unless we decide not to affiliate. Learn a lesson from our religious institutions. They guard wisdom; they protect and proclaim it. Our political parties should do the same with our American wisdom. So voting is prayer service of our great Constitution, where we proclaim our American wisdom. That wisdom emerged from the intersection of vast natural resources and the psychological liberation from ancient class systems. Those conditions allowed us to craft a new way of being a people. The American “doctrine” is that we must self-govern towards the common good because human dignity demands it. Those conditions allowed us to craft a new way of being a people. But remember, the truth claim about human dignity and the common good was long since recorded by the Jews as the essential wisdom with which they formed a people out of competing tribes. Their genius alerted us to the dehumanizing character of the tribe. And following them, Christians and Muslims crafted their own distinct notions of how a people can be formed. But the key word is formed. We have been formed into a people; we are not simply a collection of individual beasts like the herds that our ancestors tried to understand by painting them on the walls of their homes.Mosques and synagogues and churches help our spirits flourish. Our spirits shrink without the care of a gathered community. The glorious 7th game was better at the park than alone with the TV. Practicing our civic and religious liturgies and doctrines leads to goodness. Goodness grows in community. It becomes more robust, stable, enduring. Without communities of wisdom, those features that we share with animals are not elevated towards goodness; they remain basic functions of self-preservation and selfishness. We Americans remain ""groups"" at our peril. The so-called ""nones"" risk shrinking the human search for meaning into idiosyncratic practices that are not readily shared. Or to small clusters of the like-minded who never have to answer to voices other than their own. Such practices un-moored from the wisdom of a community are a breeding ground for selfishness, fertile ground for tribalism to re-emerge. Our institutions do their best work by creating communities that answer to hard fought wisdom. The polling place is our civic church, mosque, synagogue. Exercise your American spirituality, help get out the vote. Wear your “I Voted!” sticker with pride. By acting like an American, you will have done the public work of the people. Vote. It is both a civic and a religious act. So I repeat, Get Ye to your polling place! And while you are at it, give a church or mosque or synagogue a chance too. "

That prospect scares the living daylights out of people around the planet, as these comments from HuffPost’s international editions indicate. That the vile campaign Trump waged could carry him so far calls into question even Winston Churchill’s withering assessment that, “democracy is the worst system devised by wit of man, except for all the others.” The hoary contention in basic civics texts that “anyone” can become president of the United States turns out, unfortunately, to be all too true. There has to be a better way for a globally consequential nation to choose its leaders. Something is profoundly wrong if spewing out insulting tweets can pave the way to the doorstep of the White House.In a provocative essay earlier this year in The WorldPost, Beijing-based philosopher Daniel Bell argued that the meritocratic features of China’s one-party system produce more competent leaders than the United States. No one gets anywhere near the top without first being tested through long years of governing a number of Chinese provinces, he notes, many of which are larger and more populous than most European states.Following that approach, China’s Communist Party Central Committee convened last week to discuss who to promote up the ranks so they are positioned well ahead of time to take on a future leadership role. As Choi Chi-yuk reports from Hong Kong, the rising star who has emerged as a potential successor to President Xi Jinping is the party chief of Xinjiang region, Chen Quanguo. Apparently, he distinguished himself in the eyes of party elders through his hard-line rule during five years at his previous post in Tibet, Chi-yuk says. This system of selection that assures continuity in governance has enabled the Middle Kingdom to rise out of mass poverty more rapidly than any society in history. On the obvious downside, the stress on maintaining stability also entails suppression of ethnic autonomy and the crackdown on civil society.The party conclave last week further elevated President Xi Jinping to the status of “core leader,” prompting many to fear that a new Mao-like strongman is in the making. Cheng Li and Zachary Balin caution against this conclusion. Xi remains bound, they insist, by the norms of collective leadership and prohibitions against “adulation” that would foster a cult of personality.Hopefully they are right. But Xi’s steady accumulation of authority exposes the Achilles’ heel of China’s system: the “bad emperor” problem that could arise from the lack of formally institutionalized checks on the top leader. That American democracy may be producing a calamitous president of its own through the opposite path of popular elections suggests both systems are in need of reform. To take up Churchill’s implicit challenge, the alternative governing arrangement overall would combine elements of meritocratic selection with popular elections. That would place the odds on choosing the best leaders while constraining their power.HuffPost Reporters Dana Liebelson and Matt Ferner point out that, win or lose, Trump’s campaign has stirred reactionary forces that won’t now easily be contained. “Trump has unleashed forces ― forces much bigger than he is ― that simply can’t be put back into the bottle,” they quote Richard Spencer, head of the National Policy Institute, a white nationalist think tank, as saying. Steven Greenhouse doubts that Trump will be able to deliver on his simplistic promises to create new American jobs if he reaches the White House. “There is no miracle policy for creating or bringing back millions of jobs,” he writes. “It’s a long slog that will take innovation, investment, smart policy and hard work, lots of it.” Akbar Ahmed muses over the irony that Trump’s Islamophobia ended up casting a spotlight on the contributions American Muslims have made, helping to normalize their image as citizens instead of only being defined by their religion and the negative stereotypes that have come to be associated with it.In neighboring Canada, meanwhile, an anti-Islamophobia motion was passed. World Reporter Jesselyn Cook reviews the “anti-Trump” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s first year in office and reports that, according to one recent poll, 2 out of 3 Canadians are satisfied with his leadership.Turning to the world’s hot conflict zones, Christian Borys reports from Marinka, Ukraine that some soldiers on the front lines of the battle against Russian-backed separatists are beginning to doubt their cause. WorldPost Middle East Correspondent Sophia Jones reports from Debaga Camp, Iraq that civilians fleeing the self-proclaimed Islamic State are ending up in prison-like detention while they await security screening. French philosopher Bernard-Henri Lévy gives a dispatch from the front lines of the assault on Mosul, where he has been encamped with Kurdish Peshmerga fighters. As the post-coup crackdown tension continues to grow, Turkey’s justice minister tells Ilgin Yorulmaz that the purge in his country is not “100 percent over,” and that he believes America will ultimately extradite exiled cleric Fethullah Gülen because, “the U.S. will not choose a terrorist over Turkey.”Writing from Sanaa, Yemen, Mercy Corps’ Maia Baldauf describes what it’s like to be an aid worker on the ground amidst relentless bombings and heartbreaking health crises. “The scale of the conflict,” she says, “is staggering.” But even then, she says, there’s moments of warmth and reconciliation that provide hope for a better future ― if the international community lends a greater hand. Writing from Manila, Rommel Banlaoi discusses how Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is pursuing a deliberate strategy of ambiguity toward both the U.S. and China in order to leverage the benefits of each for his country. Looking at the history of kung fu in Africa, Eric Olander and Cobus van Staden explore in their podcast how the Hong Kong-produced films ― and Bruce Lee ― have made an impact on the continent in ways far greater than other Chinese media. Peter Katona worries that the “limp global response” to the rapid spread of the Zika virus portends a global health crisis. Last week the United Nations voted to begin negotiations on a global nuclear weapons ban. To remind us of the peril, The Future of Life Institute’s Ariel Conn interviews two experts on the devastating impact of nuclear weapons.Anthony Pagden reviews philosopher Charles Taylor’s new book, “The Language Animal,” citing Taylor’s argument about how language is an “alive” and “flexible” tool that absorbs, expresses and “enframes” new experience. Taylor will receive the Berggruen Prize on Dec. 1 at the New York Public Library and engage in a conversation there with CNN’s Fareed Zakaria.Finally, our Singularity series this week projects that when humans finally get to Mars, they may find an environment much like an Antarctic winter.EDITORS: Nathan Gardels, Co-Founder and Executive Advisor to the Berggruen Institute, is the Editor-in-Chief of The WorldPost.

As such, there will be many valuable takeaways from Hillary’s campaign about what dynamics emerge when a woman runs for president, what role gender plays in a campaign, and how we perceive women leaders. (I explored some of these dynamics in my book of interviews, What Will It Take to Make a Woman President? Conversations About Women, Leadership & Power, which came out before Secretary Clinton announced her second run and had many reflections about lessons learned from her 2008 campaign.) All of these insights and lessons will surely affect the campaigns of female candidates in the future. With that type of learning in mind, I decided to reach out to a woman who has been in the front seat of this campaign when it comes to outreach to women and representing a female presidential candidate, Mini Timmaraju, National Women's Vote Director of Hillary for America, to get her important thoughts and perspective on how gender has factored into this campaign.Everyone has been talking about the pivotal role women have played in this heated and turbulent presidential election. According to polls, Clinton holds a decisive 20-percentage-point lead over Trump with women, which speaks to the important contributions Timmaraju has made to galvanize and activate women voters. Timmaraju and her team have been a vital force in the presidential campaign, in her work forming diverse coalitions and engaging women voters, female elected officials, and national women’s groups, as well as building volunteer networks across the country. A longtime political activist and lawyer by training, Timmaraju has held prior leadership positions with Planned Parenthood, the US House of Representatives, and the National Council of Asian Pacific Americans, all of which she says provided a range of skills and experience that helped inform her current role and responsibilities. In the following interview, she shares her wisdom and insights as we discuss a range of topics around this unpredictable and often shocking campaign season, including some of the most exciting moments of Hillary’s campaign, what it would mean to women of the younger as well as older generations to have a woman in the White House, and how she feels about being an integral part of this moment in history to help elect our first female president.Marianne Schnall: Just to get a sense of your background, what first inspired you to take on this position and be a part of this campaign?Mini Timmaraju: I’ve spent most of my career in and out of the women’s space. Early on, during and after law school, I worked in the domestic violence movement, and then later in my political career, I spent about five years working for Planned Parenthood Federation of America, and running Planned Parenthood’s PAC and C4 in Houston, Texas. And it’s given me insight into the nexus between women’s rights, the law, public policy and politics. I graduated from law school in a state where you elected your judges, and it was an immediate lesson that elections have consequences. I was part of a team representing low-income women in these pretty tough situations, and we could tell—if it was in a county with very conservative judges—our clients had specific outcomes that you could predict. That was an early lesson that political engagement is going to be important if you want to be an advocate for women and girls and children. So that was part of my interest a long time ago in the late nineties, and I’ve always been an admirer of Hillary. I was in college when I first started paying attention to her when she gave her famous “women’s rights are human rights” speech. It was definitely one of those moments for a lot of young feminists of that time like, oh, this is fascinating that this first lady is able to take this aggressive political stance. I‘ll also confess that my mother is a big influence on my feminism and my politics, and there’s not a bigger Hillary Clinton fan. And in 2008, she was so heartbroken about the outcome of the election. Watching the election through my mother’s eyes was really eye opening for me. I saw that this meant something very significant to women of her generation.This time around when I had the chance to talk to the campaign, it was a no-brainer. We’ve had eight incredible years under Barack Obama as president, and I don’t think there’s anyone better suited to carry on his legacy than Hillary Clinton. But also, my own background, my own evolution as a young feminist, in the nineties to a little bit more seasoned feminist in my forties, I feel the urgency more than ever to elect the first woman president. For me when I got the opportunity this time, I felt like I have to do this no matter what.MS: I know you have had this very distinguished 20-year career, and I remember you talking when you were on my Women's Leadership panel, about moving back and forth from all these various sectors, in and out of politics and government and then non-profits and you are also a lawyer by training. How did your wide-range of experience and background guide your approach to organizing, coalition building and engagement?MT: The campaign has really been exceptional in recruiting very diverse talent, not just in terms of ethnicity, but also socioeconomic, political, professional experience, so I have colleagues who come from a more activist perspective, and I have other colleagues that come from a government perspective. I think my diverse background has been really useful in the women’s space because one thing with the women’s space is it’s so broad. What I like about the way the campaign approached this is we weren’t just approaching women as one monolithic groups; we created a coalition of women’s organizations and women leaders that allowed us to take advantage of the diversity of women who support Hillary Clinton. I think the fact that I’ve been able to work—but I also was pretty deeply steeped in the activist space—I understand how women in government and business think from prior roles, and that has allowed me to be a good intermediary between those different groups of women. I’ve also spent a significant part of my career working with communities of color, and I think it’s really interesting: intersectionality is a huge thing in the feminist movement right now but also in the way the women’s movement organizes itself. I think Hilary Clinton gets this more than anybody. She’s been working with communities of color her entire career—her mentors are women of color, Marian Wright Edelman, the women she surrounds herself with, like Donna Brazile, Maggie Williams, Minyon Moore are women of color—and she gets this work intrinsically.MS: That is so critical. I have definitely been struck by how much more “women’s issues” have been up front and center this time around than in 2008. I was thinking back to one of the most iconic moments after Donald Trump accused Secretary Clinton of “playing the woman card” and her response, which of course went viral, was, “If fighting for women’s healthcare and paid family leave and equal pay is playing the woman’s card, then deal me in.” That was such a perfect response and throughout the campaign, she has seemed so comfortable with no apologies, talking about “women’s issues,” because as you said at my panel, these issues like equal pay and paid family leave are issues that are economic drivers that affect us all. Do you think that there has been some progress that these issues were so much more visible and that playing the “woman card” is not only seen as positive but actually essential?MT: You know, her entire career she has fought for these same issues and they didn’t get the same amount of attention. I think if we look back at the 2008 race, she was talking about the same issues. I just read a piece Liz Plank wrote in Vox, where she said this isn’t really an election about women; it is still an election about men! It’s just an interesting observation. I think that what’s been more exacerbated this cycle has been the attacks from the right on her for pushing so-called “women’s issues” and her response, and as a result, I think that we’re seeing stronger, more active women’s political engagement from organizations and leaders in this cycle. When she did the “woman card” and the “deal me in,” it was because she got attacked twice—first by Mitch McConnell, and then later by Donald Trump. Our incredibly smart campaign team on the digital side, came up with the actual “woman card,” and it blew up—I mean, the response to it was huge! Everywhere I go across the country, if I ask women if they have a woman card, they whip it right out of their wallet. It’s been exciting and fun to watch, and everywhere the Secretary goes, she talks about that “woman card” moment. Women in the audience will shout, “Deal me in!” at her—like a call and response you would see at a concert or a rallying cry. But I think a lot of this came about because of the way the GOP has responded to these issues. I think there’s been rising political power of women, thanks to groups like EMILY’s List, Planned Parenthood, NARAL. You know, we’ve elected more women to office, we’re going to have a record-setting year of women in the Senate this time, we’ve got more women of color being elected to office, and I think you’re seeing a rising strength of women at the ballot box, but also women in politics. And I think it’s been transformative and it’s empowered and emboldened our supporters but also frustrated and created an anxiety within the leaders on the other side of the aisle. I think this anxiety is manifested in the constant attacks on Secretary Clinton and her women supporters and that has ratcheted up this cycle to a level we’ve never seen before. It’s beyond Donald Trump’s appalling behavior toward women, and it’s now entrenched in the GOPs appalling behavior towards women, characterized, for example, by the aggressiveness in 2008 on efforts to defund Planned Parenthood and to roll back access to reproductive rights. All of these attacks need to be seen contextually together. I don’t think you can separate one catch phrase from a campaign from the overall attack on women in this country and the surge and support from women. MS: I have been thinking about this kind of unsettling juxtaposition of this historic milestone for women, and then all of the stuff that has been unearthed in these past few weeks—all these disturbing comments and attitudes toward women and charges of sexual assault, and threats to rollback reproductive rights—and what that says about the overall status of women and how it is connected. I think that is a point of reflection for sure.MT: Remember Claire McCaskill and Todd Aiken and the “legitimate rape” incident. I think all of these moments were key to informing the way we now think about “women’s issues.” I think it’s so critically important and smart that Hillary Clinton herself refuses to concede that they’re just women’s issues. She really believes that these are America’s issues and that we as a nation can make that transformative next step to elect the first woman president. But at the same time, that’s threatening to the GOP and the extreme right.MS: On the flipside, are you surprised that there hasn’t been more excitement and awareness of the historic nature of her candidacy as we approach the prospect of breaking through this ultimate glass ceiling? Has that been a delicate dance to do, so that it’s not just “vote for Hillary because she’d be the first female president,” but at the same time this is an amazing opportunity when you have somebody as qualified and prepared as she is to break that barrier.MT: So that’s interesting—this was a much more frequent question in the primary than the general. But I think because of my unique role in the campaign, I have never—I am not naïve, I know that there’s been a lot of reporting that people aren’t excited—but I have never seen this. I’ve only seen excitement from women’s supporters about the prospect of a first woman president. In the past two months I have been to about 10 to 11 states, and in the primaries I had been to 6 or 7—wherever I go and talk to women or undecided voters, there is an emotional reaction and a very palpable excitement and enthusiasm about electing the first woman president. And as we are getting closer and closer and closer to the election, people are emailing me their photograph with their “I voted” sticker.We just had a conference call on Friday with women leaders and Stephanie Schriock, the head of EMILY’s List, was on the call. She was talking about her grandmother who was in Iowa, who was born before women had the right to vote, voting for the first woman president, and several people emailed me and said, “I started crying when Stephanie was talking about her grandmother.” I mean, we have these series of videos we put together, of women who were born before they had the right to vote, and it’s very emotional. I think that there’s a lot of misrepresentation that we don’t have enthusiasm on our side, but think of it this way: what an incredibly long and grueling election cycle this has been, and if we did not have enthusiasm on our side, we would not have filled – I was just reading Robby Mook’s campaign memo to our volunteers - I believe we filled seventy thousand volunteer shifts this past weekend. That’s more than President Obama did on similar a weekend in 2008 and 2012. So it’s like, I know that there’s a feeling that there’s a narrative out there that there’s no excitement around this, but that’s not what we’re seeing. That’s not what I see. MS: Trump’s offensive comments have triggered a lot of women to come forward with their stories of sexual assault, whether specifically by Trump or all of the countless women on the Internet opening up with their own personal stories reminding us of how pervasive this problem is. His comments uncovered this whole “locker room talk” conversation, which I know is so connected to issues that Secretary Clinton has worked on for many years, for example, consent on college campuses. I think this serves to remind us how important it is that we elect a president who is going to have policies and plans to create awareness and take action on issues like sexual assault.MT: Completely. When she rolled out that policy last year in the primary, it was because she was visiting college campuses and she was hearing these horrible stories. It wasn’t any intention in her mind that, “I’m going to be working against a candidate who himself has been accused of sexual assault!” But that’s a great example. I’ve been in multiple states since the third debate with Donald Trump and the “nasty woman” comment, and this has been one of the most fascinating things…. Like when people say there’s no energy, there is no enthusiasm—everywhere I go, I see women with their own self-made nasty woman T-shirt or nasty woman button or nasty woman meme or on their Facebook. It just took off virally. It’s the definition of excitement and enthusiasm. Spotify said there were 250 percent more streams of Janet Jackson’s song “Nasty”! [laughs] I don’t think it would be so transformative if he wasn’t tapping into the work that you do, and that many of your colleagues have been doing for so long, which is making sure women feel empowered. The reason this is all flipping on its head the way it is, is because feminists and others have been building this movement for so long. Women feel empowered to say no or to re-appropriate terms that are terms that are supposed to be derogatory and say “Sure, if that’s what a nasty woman is, I’m a nasty woman too, and I’m going to vote for her.” That’s been really fun to watch—that out of all this darkness, something really kind of fun and exciting has happened, which is that women are taking back their power, and saying no, we’re not going to let you define us. We’re not going to let you define her either, which has been awesome. It’s really exciting.MS: Yeah, I totally agree with that. I think it’s waking up and energizing women. I remember when Donald Trump said that comment about how Secretary Clinton didn’t have “a presidential look.” And of course in the interviews in my book What Will It Take to Make a Woman President? about the obstacles to women’s leadership, there was a lot of conversation about unconscious biases we have toward female leaders. How aware has Secretary Clinton had to be about the kind of biases and scrutiny there are toward women leaders, for example, this line between showing she’s tough enough to be commander-in-chief, yet also perceived as likable—all of these comments that she has weathered about her not smiling or her shouting, which are obviously not applied to her male counterparts. Is there a conscious effort to be aware of those perceptions, or is it just something that at this point she doesn’t worry about?MT: You know, if there is a consciousness about that, I am not aware of it. I think she’s been doing this for so long and navigating that line for so long. And if anything now, our society has sort of caught up with her, you know? I think, like what, 8 years ago when she was in the Senate, people were like why does she wear so many pantsuits? And now there’s a pantsuit parade in Manhattan that went to Brooklyn in front of our office where people are celebrating the pantsuit! I mean, I think we’ve caught up to her. I think she’s the original revolutionary and we finally figured it out.MS: What lessons have you learned from this campaign that you think have been useful about engaging women and also about representing a female candidate that could help inform future campaigns? Obviously we are hoping to have more women presidents and more women in all positions of political leadership.MT: You know, this felt like the longest primary ever, but in the end, because we had such a robust primary with such a thoughtful and skilled opponent, we were so much more ready for this general election. For example, just the infrastructure we’ve been able to build in all these states, we’ve got an incredibly smart and strategic team that is always thinking about next steps, building the campaign infrastructure—which is like majority based on volunteers—so I think that while it was exhausting for a lot of our supporters that worked on our primary, we’re sharper and better and stronger. So I think one lesson learned is continuing to keep volunteer recruitment and engagement. I mean, most of my job has been volunteer engagement and recruitment and working with our groups to make sure their volunteers and their supporters are plugged into our operation, and I don’t think they can ever start that too early. It’s got to be a 24/7 campaign, it can’t just be on on-years, it has to be on off-years, right? And I think this campaign has built something really special, the way President Obama did with millennials and communities of color. We’ve done an amazing job with doing that with women and there’s something there, particularly in outreach to women who are hard to reach. And also, a slight historical fact, we’ll see how it plays out on November 8, we’re pulling ahead with white women, like college educated white women, that went to Mitt Romney in 2012. It will be by continuing to build a coalition between college educated, republican women, progressive women and women of color, then we will really be able to build a movement that’s going to be able to pass equal pay, paid family leave, and stop rolling back restrictions on access to healthcare. And I think women get that. As the secretary said, we are the ones who roll up our sleeves, we get to work every day on new things, but how do we make it more continuous? I think people are ready for that.MS: I definitely think there will be a lot that we can take away and learn from. You probably remember that my book was inspired by then 8-year-old daughter Lotus asking why we never had a woman president. And actually while I was writing down questions for this interview, she was reading a biography of Susan B. Anthony—it wasn’t so long ago women didn’t even have the right to vote. Do you ever stop and feel the enormous significance of this moment and milestone? You were talking earlier about the huge significance that this candidacy and campaign has had for older generations of women, but in terms of inspiring young girls, I remember you talking during the panel about how even fathers were so grateful for this transformative opportunity. Do you ever stop and feel the significance of this campaign, and was that as sort of this additional opportunity and responsibility, getting all these letters from these young girls and just taking in the symbolism? MT: Yeah, so there are actually a couple of people on our team in Brooklyn who have been collecting the letters and just making sure the secretary gets to see them. There’s sort of a subgroup of campaign staff, including myself, who are really into reading these letters from young girls. And I think you may have seen, we actually cut an ad during the primary of “44 Boys is Too Many”—little girls reading letters to Hillary Clinton. And wherever we go, there’s always a couple of little girls in the campaign office who are knocking doors and making calls because they are super fans of Hillary. MS: How you hope this time in history is remembered?MT: I want it to be remembered as an empowering, exciting, positive time for women and the women’s movement. We’re not going to win because Donald Trump is a complete disaster. We’re going to win because the coalition of Americans stood up to that but also coalesced around a really amazing, brilliant leader, Hillary Clinton, who’s the most qualified person to ever run for president, even according to Barack Obama. That when we get past November 8th, we’re going to move forward, and she’s got a remarkable talent of working across the aisle and then bringing people together. I’m hopeful that that’s what folks will remember looking back. ***Marianne Schnall is a widely published writer and interviewer whose writings and interviews have appeared in a variety of media outlets including O, The Oprah Magazine, Marie Claire, CNN.com, AOL Build, the Women’s Media Center and The Huffington Post.

72,POLITICS,Latinos Take Their Revenge On Sheriff Joe Arpaio,Roque Planas,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mexican-americans-take-their-revenge-on-sheriff-arpaio_us_581e0596e4b0d9ce6fbc6a2a,Undocumented immigrants are playing a leading role in the campaign aiming to take him down.,2016-11-05,Belen Gutierrez fills out contact information for the Bazta Arpaio campaign attempting to unseat Sheriff Joe Arpaio.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/581e0949150000b700531e20.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"PHOENIX ― Belén Gutiérrez will cast her first ballot in a U.S. election on Nov. 8. But she might have let the opportunity slip by, if not for Berta Rita. In the weeks ahead of Election Day, Rita has driven 40 minutes into town every afternoon to knock on doors in Phoenix’s heavily Mexican-American West side on behalf of the Bazta Arpaio campaign. When Gutiérrez answered, she said she’d looked forward to voting since she became a U.S. citizen two years ago, but found the process unfamiliar and intimidating. When she couldn’t find her early voting ballot, Gutiérrez accepted an offer for a free lift to her polling station on Election Day.In an election where GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump’s farcical attacks against Mexicans and other immigrants have energized the Latino vote, Gutiérrez has a more local reason to cast a ballot this year. “More than anything, I want to get [Maricopa County Sheriff Joe] Arpaio out,” Gutiérrez told HuffPost. “I’ve got a lot of family here who don’t have papers. I don’t want him after us just because we’ve got Mexican colors. Just because of the color of my skin, they want to stop me and ask for my papers.”Arpaio, the sheriff of Maricopa County, which encompasses Phoenix, has made immigration raids a centerpiece of his two-decade tenure. He’s butted heads with federal authorities in the process and lost a 2007 civil lawsuit that found he racially profiled Latinos. With Arpaio preparing to face criminal contempt charges for allegedly continuing to discriminate against Hispanics in violation of the court order, the chances of unseating the hardliner have rarely looked so good.For Rita, who can’t vote herself because she’s undocumented, each door knock resulting in another Latino vote amounts to a personal victory. She lost her job doing cleaning work at an office building after one of Arpaio’s raids. She hasn’t had steady work since. Her husband also lost a construction job after a raid, though he’s been able to find work since. “Almost everyone we’ve reached is voting for the first time,” Rita says, flipping through pictures of herself meeting with voters on her cell phone. Even if they fail to unseat Arpaio, grassroots efforts to mobilize the Latino vote against him will likely continue to have an impact well beyond this electoral cycle. Neither party focused on reaching Latino voters in the reliably red state of Arizona until late the in the election. Polling by Latino Decisions has showed that nationwide, most Latino voters hadn’t been contacted by a political campaign as of September ― partly because most Hispanics live in states that parties generally view as uncompetitive, like Arizona.“People aren’t going to spend money to lose by a smaller margin,” Sylvia Manzano, a principal at Latino Decisions, told HuffPost. So it’s often been grassroots groups like One Arizona who do the long, slow work of knocking on doors and setting up tables outside supermarkets and public parks to recruit first-time voters into the electoral process. Viridiana Hernández, Rita’s daughter, volunteered in that campaign, which registered 150,000 Latino voters, and now sits on the board of People United for Justice, the group running the Bazta Arpaio campaign. “For years, neither party has served our community,” Hernandez told HuffPost. “People have been disengaged by the political process… When you look at the neighborhoods and don’t see campaign signs, you can see the lack of investment.”  Over the the last few months, however, that’s changed. After the Democratic National Convention, Arizona party leaders began pressing the Clinton campaign to spend more time and money trying to move the state, arguing that this year it could flip. The party responded, sending both Clinton and top surrogates to the state and mobilizing get out the vote efforts. Liberal billionaire George Soros also spent $2 million this month to fund super PAC Maricopa Strong’s TV ads attacking Arpaio and promoting his Democratic rival, Paul Penzone.“Democrats have a unique opportunity to win in Arizona, and we’re not letting it go to waste,” DNC spokesman Walter Garcia told HuffPost in an email. “That’s why Secretary Clinton, Tim Kaine, and Michelle Obama have all recently campaigned in the state, and the DNC’s ‘Forward Together’ bus tour rallied voters in the Grand Canyon State to elect Democrats up and down the ballot.” Grassroots and party efforts are paying off. Arizona led the country in early ballots cast by Hispanic voters this year. Gutiérrez, a mother of five, hopes those votes send the message that anti-immigrant politics won’t win elections. “People who came here from another place didn’t come to hurt anyone,” Gutiérrez said. “What mother wouldn’t want to make a better future for her kids?” "
73,MEDIA,Fox News Hosts Boost Clinton Indictment Claim The Network Already Shot Down,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fox-news-clinton-indictment_us_581e3231e4b0e80b02ca6c30,"Their top news anchor has apologized for wrongly saying a Clinton indictment is ""likely"" but others are still making the claim.",2016-11-05,"Fox News anchor Bret Baier walked back his report that Hillary Clinton was ""likely"" to be indicted.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If you watched “Fox & Friends” for a 10-minute stretch during the 8 a.m. hour Saturday, you might think Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton is likely to be indicted in the coming months. If you stuck with the show into the 9 a.m. hour, you’d have learned why there can’t be any imminent indictment and also reminded that Fox News walked back its reporting of that baseless claim.The network’s handing of the false indictment claim demonstrated the sometimes schizophrenic nature of Fox News, whereby a right-leaning news operation co-exists with conservative hosts and guests who may undermine the network’s own reporting. The initial failure, however, wasn’t with the opinion hosts, but took place on the news side.“Special Report” anchor Bret Baier reported Wednesday that a post-election indictment over the Clinton Foundation is “likely,” a claim made by two anonymous sources. Several news organizations rebutted the unsubstantiated claim, which was reckless to air so close to an election. The potentially damaging claim also comes as the FBI, considered broadly pro-Trump, is leaking innuendo about Clinton. Though Baier admitted his “mistake” on Friday, “the damage” ― to quote Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway ― was already “done” for Clinton.Trump continued talking up the likelihood of an indictment Friday afternoon on the campaign trail, including during a stop in Wilmington, Ohio, which aired live on Fox News.Fox News hosts devoted over two hours of airtime to the indictment claim prior to Baier’s Friday apology. Afterward, some Fox News stars continued promoting the claim, while others tamped it down. “This is so much scurrilous rumor, innuendo,” Fox News contributor Juan Williams said on “The Five.” “I don’t think it’s fair to anyone. We would never do that to Trump. If it was done by the liberal media, you would call it out. So let’s just stop it.”When Fox News contributor and Trump critic Charles Krauthammer mentioned during the 6 p.m. Friday newscast that Clinton “could be” indicted, Baier urged the panelists “to be very clear here.” Krauthammer said using the word “indictment” was a slip of the tongue. The next hour, anchor Brit Hume said “there is no certainty in the FBI on whether Secretary Clinton will be indicted.”But Sean Hannity, Trump’s biggest media booster, raised the specter of indictment on his 10 p.m. show. “If she wins on Tuesday, Clinton could be indicted while in office,” he said. “She will spend all of her time certainly fighting off any type of indictment or criminal charges against her. Well, that will create a massive constitutional crisis.”Later, Hannity asked former House Speaker and Trump supporter Newt Gingrich about whether a President Clinton would spend most of her time fighting off “potential indictment,” a case the host had been making. Unsurprisingly, Gingrich agreed. On Saturday morning, author Ed Klein claimed that sources told him “there’s a very good chance that if she’s elected president on Nov. 8, by the time inauguration comes around, [FBI director] Comey will have recommended an indictment of the president-to-be.”Klein provided nothing to back up his claim and the hosts of “Fox & Friends” ― Trump’s go-to destination after Hannity’s program ― didn’t challenge it. Co-host Clayton Morris ran with Klein’s claim and suggested that if Clinton won, perhaps Vice President Tim Kaine would have to take over. “This would be remarkable,” he said. Fox News and the New York Post, both owned by the Murdoch family, have long promoted Klein’s claims about the Clintons and President Barack Obama. But Klein’s books, complete with dramatic scenes supposedly happening behind closed doors, are largely dismissed by mainstream news outlets.About 10 minutes later, Fox News host Eric Bolling said on the show that “there is a very, very real possibility if Hillary Clinton is the next president-elect, she could be indicted.”The “Fox & Friends” hosts, again, didn’t push back. But a Fox News correspondent did. “Your last two guests have spoken of imminent indictments,” said Geraldo Rivera. “You know, and I know, that Fox News a few days ago had to backtrack on the report that indictments were imminent... We have corrected our reporting in that regard.”Rivera, who is also an attorney, pointed out that there would need to be a grand jury impaneled before someone could even be indicted ― and that initial step hasn’t happened. So the suggestion an indictment is likely, even imminent, is without merit. "
74,ENTERTAINMENT,"Dave Chappelle Voted For Hillary Clinton, But Doesn't 'Feel Good' About It",Cole Delbyck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dave-chappelle-hillary-clinton_us_581e25a9e4b0d9ce6fbc71f9,The comedian reportedly dug into both candidates in a bizarre stand-up set on Friday.,2016-11-05,Dave Chappelle performs at a sold-out show in March.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/581e30d5190000a304c31188.jpeg?cache=ZevwK4yo8p&ops=crop_209_0_2791_2147%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Dave Chappelle isn’t particularly pleased with either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump ― or how the media’s spinning his comments about the election.During a stand-up show in New York on Friday night, the comedian made known his displeasure for the dueling presidential nominees in a bizarre 60-minute set at The Cutting Room that received extensive play in The Observer, a publication owned by the GOP nominee’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. It’s hard to really know what went down, since recording devices were not allowed at the show and a person who said she was in the audience disputed The Observer’s account, which also has Chappelle expressing some controversial views on LGBTQ rights. The outlet framed his comments as pro-Trump, with a headline reading “Dave Chappelle Defends Trump, Rips Clinton,” but according to Chappelle’s team, the comedian took shots at both candidates.“Dave is disgusted by the tone of the election and especially by the idea that his comedy would be misconstrued to defend Trump,” a representative for Chappelle told The Huffington Post in an email. The Observer wrote that Chappelle seemed to take special pleasure in ripping into Clinton. Although he admitted that he voted for the Democratic nominee in his home state of Ohio, he told the crowd he didn’t “feel good” about it. “She’s going to be on a coin someday. And her behavior has not been coin-worthy,” he said, per The Observer. “She’s not right and we all know she’s not right.”The comic reportedly claimed that Clinton was behind the leak of Trump’s explicit 2005 hot mic recording, although the Clinton campaign has said it had “no advance knowledge of the tapes.”Chappelle appeared to echo Trump’s sentiments about how the former secretary of state has been colluding with the media over the course of the election. The Observer quotes him blaming the media for the content of the tape, instead of Trump’s misogyny. “Sexual assault? It wasn’t. ‘And when you’re a star, they let you do it,’” he said, quoting Trump’s groping boast in the recording. “That phrase implies consent. I just don’t like the way the media twisted that whole thing. Nobody questioned it.”Apparently, Chappelle also praised Trump for facing criticism from moderators Anderson Cooper and Martha Raddatz with the resilience of the Terminator. He then proceeded to share a variety of controversial statements about women’s and LGBTQ issues, suggesting that he believes in prioritizing the fight against racism instead of adopting an intersectional approach to social justice. “They should not be having that conversation in front of black people,” he said, according to The Observer. “You go ahead and feel something about your rights. But if you’re putting sexism and homophobia and transphobia in front of racism, you should be ashamed of yourself.”But Chappelle apparently only made matters worse in his discussion of of North Carolina’s “bathroom bill.” After decrying that it’s insane for needing to “show your birth certificate to take a dump at a Wal-Mart in North Carolina,” he took one giant step backwards by reportedly saying that he’d prefer not to have a “woman with a dick” next to him at the urinal.Chappelle is set to appear on “Saturday Night Live” next weekend with musical guest A Tribe Called Quest in what is perhaps his most public appearance since he largely disappeared from the public eye around 2005.

As his chances of winning have improved, immigrant communities have grown fearful.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The past few months have weighed heavily on Walter Barrientos.The 32-year-old former undocumented immigrant, who has relatives and friends who remain without legal status, has seen the harsh anti-immigrant rhetoric from GOP nominee Donald Trump’s presidential campaign spill over into everyday life. A relative of his was in the process of buying a home. But she thought twice when she saw a stream of Trump lawn signs in the neighborhood. His father, an electrician, has had clients ask for his papers (he’s a green card holder) and mock his limited English. But as Election Day has neared and the contest grown tighter, that emotional toll has morphed into an acute anxiety. For Barrientos, the days are now filled with frantic calls from friends and family and regular checks of polling data. His dad, who had never been politically active during his 15 years living on Long Island, New York City, has felt it, too. For the first time in his life, he’s been doing Get Out The Vote drives for local candidates.“There is a real fear for him,” said Barrientos, an organizer for the Latino community group Make the Road Action. “And as we get closer to the election, I’m definitely nervous about the outcome too. I’ve really become scared of November 9 because I think this election has pushed people to both extremes but specifically on the right. I’m having a hard time seeing how they come back to the center as they have in past elections.”The closing of any campaign can be a trying experience for many voters, especially in an election as divisive and bitter and long as the current one. But for many immigrants, specifically those whose legal status is in limbo or who have family members in such circumstances, it has become absolutely draining. More than any other group, their futures are directly impacted by Tuesday’s outcome; they sense every movement of the race on a visceral level. “It is stressful,” said Erika Castro of Las Vegas, Nevada, “especially knowing how my life can change drastically.”The 27-year-old is a recipient of President Barack Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, which allows her and other young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as kids to receive a renewable two-year work permit. Last week, she renewed her DACA status for the third time knowing full well that Trump has said he would end the program. And so, with uncertainty hanging over her head, Castro has tried her best to determine her own fate. Recently, she accompanied her brother, a U.S. citizen, to vote and has encouraged her friends to do the same. She checks the polls a few times a day but, she says, “not too much because I know how intense it can get.” On Tuesday, she will be working with her organization, a non-partisan voter registration outfit called Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada, to get people to the polls.“They don’t feel like their vote matters,” she said of the conversations she has had with some voters. “And I explain to them my story.”Immigration has been a central topic in past elections. Four years ago Obama, a pro-reform candidate who lacked major accomplishments, was pitted against Mitt Romney, a former moderate Republican who promised to encourage “self-deportation” in order to win the GOP primary. At the time, the gap between the two seemed vast. And, certainly, the enthusiasm among Latinos voters in that election was a testament to that divide.But this cycle, the debate has taken on an entirely more dramatic and darker tone. Hillary Clinton has promised to continue and expand deportation relief started under Obama and begin her push for immigration reform within the first 100 days in office. Trump, by contrast, says he will immediately embark on aggressive deportation efforts and dismantle Obama’s programs.  For undocumented immigrants, the contest has become, quite literally, a life-altering event ― one that’s increasingly difficult to watch. It’s compelled them to participate in the only way they can: not by voting, but urging others to cast their ballots. Adiarose, a 65-year-old from the Philippines who asked that her name be withheld to protect her immigration status, traveled to Colorado this week with the group Domestic Workers Legacy Fund to help push the vote for Clinton, Democratic House candidate Morgan Carroll and the minimum wage ballot measure. She’s a fan of the Democratic presidential nominee and has watched anxiously as her margin has narrowed. “I’m very afraid because I know how [Trump] has said things about immigrants or the people who come here with no documents,” Adiarose said. Yaneli, who also asked that her last name be withheld because of her undocumented status, said she worries about what would happen to her family under a Trump presidency. She came to the U.S. from Mexico when she was 18. Now 33, she is married with two children, a boy and a girl, both of whom are U.S. citizens. “He says he wants to kick us out,” she said in Spanish. “If they send us to Mexico, I’m worried about who would take care of my children. He’s putting my children’s future in jeopardy.”For some without documentation, strategizing for life under Trump has become a preoccupation. Greisa Martinez Rosas, advocacy director for the undocumented youth organization United We Dream, said she has heard stories about undocumented people instructing children not to answer the door should a Trump-sanctioned deportation force came to fruition. “It’s on these last final days where people that have avoided like the plague following this election are forced to do so, and have to come up with concrete plans for what to do with their families if the worst were to happen,” she said.There is still work to be done to head off a potential Trump presidency. Latino voters have come out in droves in several critical early-voting states, like Nevada and Florida ― driven, undoubtedly, about the fear of the unthinkable. And it’s not just the presidential contest that is motivating them.Blanca Gamez, 27, has her eyes on down-ballot candidates who are also important for protecting immigrant efforts. She is working to elect Democratic candidates as a fellow at the group For Our Future, and was in an ad asking citizens to vote because undocumented immigrants like her cannot. Her sister was born in the U.S. after Gamez and their parents moved to the country from Mexico when she was seven months old. Her father is now a legal permanent resident, while she has DACA and her mother is undocumented. Nearly every day, her mother calls to ask “how our girls,” ― Clinton and Nevada Democratic senate candidate Catherine Cortez Masto ― are doing,Gamez said. Those calls have become more panicky than usual recently. But they serve to motivate as well. “Fear is turning into, ‘OK, let’s getting into reality and let’s do something about this,’” Gamez said of her mother. “Because if [Trump] wins, we’re going to lose everything.” Roque Planas contributed reporting.HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

A wall of beautiful voters.""",2016-11-05,"Registered Democrats turned out in force in Nevada’s largest counties, providing Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton a critical boost.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587a994d120000c301ad79a9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Friday marked the end of early voting in the battleground state of Nevada, and the final returns brought decidedly good news for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.Registered Democrats turned out in force in Nevada’s largest counties, providing Clinton a critical boost in a state where polling aggregates show the former secretary of state and GOP nominee Donald Trump within a few points of one another.Over 57,000 votes were cast in populous Clark County, a single-day record that propelled Democrats to a statewide ballot edge on par with results at the same point in 2012, when President Barack Obama won Nevada by nearly 7 points.Turnout was strong throughout the day, and election officials pledged to keep polling places open as long as there were voters in line. At 9pm, hundreds were still waiting to vote at a Mexican supermarket in Las Vegas. “Looks like Trump got his wall after all. A wall of beautiful voters,” wrote Yvanna Cancela of the local Culinary Union, which has played a key role in Democrats’ get-out-the-vote operations this year. That union also represents the workers who recently voted to organize Trump International hotel on the Vegas strip.Democrats also overtook Republicans in Nevada’s second largest county, surrounding Reno, which has historically been closely contested.“If you have a panic button GOP, find it,” tweeted Jon Ralston, a veteran political reporter in the state. “Trump is dead.”Returns in Nevada and several other states with early voting ― including Florida, Colorado, Georgia and Arizona ― have shown large turnout increases among Latino voters. In Florida, as of Friday, Latino in-person voting was up over 150 percent from the same time in 2012. Trump has a rally in Reno planned for Saturday evening, though The New York Times reported that “strategists in both parties were somewhat puzzled by the trip” since early voting has already ended.Winning there may simply be essential for Trump. If Clinton takes Nevada, she could lose all of the other current swing states ― Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, Iowa, Arizona and Georgia ― and still win the presidency, assuming the non-battleground states do not shift."

79,POLITICS,Nate Silver Is Unskewing Polls -- All Of Them -- In Trump's Direction,Ryan Grim,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nate-silver-election-forecast_us_581e1c33e4b0d9ce6fbc6f7f,The vaunted 538 election forecaster is putting his thumb on the scales.,2016-11-05,"Nate Silver sits on the stairs at Allegro hotel in downtown Chicago on Nov. 9, 2012. The statistician correctly predicted the 2012 presidential winner in all 50 states and almost all the Senate races.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"During the 2012 election, Republicans who hated the daily onslaught of polling showing that Mitt Romney was headed toward a comfortable defeat turned to Dean Chambers, the man who launched the website Unskewed Polls. The poll numbers were wrong, he said, and by tweaking a few things, he could give a more accurate count. His final projection had Romney winning close to all 50 states.Chambers has wisely abandoned the field of election forecasting, and this year says he thinks the various models predicting a Hillary Clinton victory are probably accurate. The models themselves are pretty confident. HuffPost Pollster is giving Clinton a 98 percent chance of winning, and The New York Times’ model at The Upshot puts her chances at 85 percent. There is one outlier, however, that is causing waves of panic among Democrats around the country, and injecting Trump backers with the hope that their guy might pull this thing off after all. Nate Silver’s 538 model is giving Donald Trump a heart-stopping 35 percent chance of winning as of this weekend. He ratcheted the panic up to 11 on Friday with his latest forecast, tweeting out, “Trump is about 3 points behind Clinton ― and 3-point polling errors happen pretty often.”So who’s right? The beauty here is that we won’t have to wait long to find out. But let’s lay out now why we think we’re right and 538 is wrong. Or, at least, why they’re doing it wrong. The short version is that Silver is changing the results of polls to fit where he thinks the polls truly are, rather than simply entering the poll numbers into his model and crunching them. Silver calls this unskewing a “trend line adjustment.” He compares a poll to previous polls conducted by the same polling firm, makes a series of assumptions, runs a regression analysis, and gets a new poll number. That’s the number he sticks in his model ― not the original number.He may end up being right, but he’s just guessing. A “trend line adjustment” is merely political punditry dressed up as sophisticated mathematical modeling. Guess who benefits from the unskewing?By the time he’s done adjusting the “trend line,” Clinton has lost 0.2 points and Trump has gained 1.7 points. An adjustment of below 2 points may not seem like much, but it’s enough to throw off his entire forecast, taking a comfortable 4.6 point Clinton lead and making it look like a nail-biter.It’s enough to close the gap between the two candidates to below 3 points, which allows Silver to say that it’s now anybody’s ballgame, because “3-point polling errors happen pretty often.”That line in itself is disingenuous, though. For the polls to be wrong, there wouldn’t need to be one single 3-point error. All of the polls ― all of them, as Brianna Keilar would put it ― would have to be off by 3 points in the same direction. That’s happened before, but in 2012 the error favored President Barack Obama. In 2014, it favored Republicans. Errors are just as likely to favor Clinton as they are to favor Trump, and they would have to favor Trump. And we still haven’t accounted for the unique fact that one campaign has a get-out-the-vote operation, while the other doesn’t.By monkeying around with the numbers like this, Silver is making a mockery of the very forecasting industry that he popularized. “The idea that she’s a prohibitive, 95 percent-plus favorite is hard to square with polling that has frequently shown 5- or 6-point swings within the span of a couple weeks, given that she only leads by 3 points or so now,” he told Politico recently. “[E]verything depends on one’s assumptions, but I think that our assumptions ― a Clinton lead, sure, but high uncertainty ― has repeatedly been validated by the evidence we’ve seen over the course of the past several months.”I get why Silver wants to hedge. It’s not easy to sit here and tell you that Clinton has a 98 percent chance of winning. Everything inside us screams out that life is too full of uncertainty, that being so sure is just a fantasy. But that’s what the numbers say. What is the point of all the data entry, all the math, all the modeling, if when the moment of truth comes we throw our hands up and say, hey, anything can happen. If that’s how we feel, let’s scrap the entire political forecasting industry.Silver’s guess that the race is up for grabs might be a completely reasonable assertion ― but it’s the stuff of punditry, not mathematical forecasting.Punditry has been Silver’s go-to move this election cycle, and it hasn’t served him well. He repeatedly pronounced that Trump had a close to 0 percent chance of winning the Republican primary, even as he led in the polls. “Trump’s chances [are] higher than 0 but (considerably) less than 20 percent,” he wrote in November.Silver was far from alone in being wrong. I said myself, at the time, that Trump had no chance of winning the primary. But I did so as a pundit, and, as a pundit, I am endowed by my creator the inalienable right to be consistently wrong and never apologize. But our polling model always forecast a Trump win, and our polling team, led by Natalie Jackson, stuck by that prediction, because their job is to follow the numbers. They were right, while pundits like me and Silver were wrong.Even though the HuffPost and New York Times models both have very high confidence that Clinton will win ― and The Upshot’s Nate Cohn has consistently said Clinton is the runaway favorite, even after Jim Comey’s entrance into the campaign ― we differ on how big the current gap is. Much of the disagreement comes from using a different style of regression analysis. The difference between the Upshot’s 3 percent and 538’s 3 percent is that the Upshot is using one style of regression analysis to get theirs ― whereas 538 is actually moving the polling numbers and then running its regression analysis.The HuffPost model uses a stickier regression, which assumes that the populace does not swiftly change its mind on a dime about a candidate based on a bad news day. After all, one difference between pundits and regular people is that the former live on Twitter with cable news on in the background, while regular folks catch campaign developments in snippets, if at all. That makes it really, really hard for even the worst day to cause a real 6-point swing.  So when new polls come out showing a candidate surging, that surge has to sustain itself to register fully in our model. The Times model, which actually relies on HuffPost data, puts a bit more grease in its charts, and so the numbers can move up or down more quickly. In the last week, the model’s confidence in a Clinton win fell from 93 to 85, while HuffPost’s barely dropped. So if Nate Cohn and Nate Silver both see a roughly 3-point race, why is one Nate confident in a Clinton win and the other sparking a collective global freakout? Because Silver is also unskewing state polls, which explains, for instance, why 538 is predicting Trump will win Florida, even as we and others (and the early vote) see it as a comfortable Clinton lead. To see how it works in action, take the Marist College poll conducted Oct. 25-26. Silver rates Marist as an “A” pollster, and they found Clinton with a 1-point lead. Silver then “adjusted” it to make it a 3-point Trump lead. HuffPost Pollster, meanwhile, has near certainty Clinton is leading in Florida. In response to this article, Silver tweeted:“Every model makes assumptions but we actually test ours based on the evidence. Some of the other models are barley even empirical,” he said in another post.We’ll have to wait and see what happens. Maybe Silver will be right come Election Day ― Trump will win Florida, and we’ll all be in for a very long night. Or our forecast will be right, she’ll win nationally by 5 or 6, and we can all turn in early.If he’s right, though, it was just a good guess ― a fortunate “trend line adjustment” ― not a mathematical forecast. If you want to put your faith in the numbers, you can relax. She’s got this.This story has been updated with a response from Nate Silver.CORRECTION: Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this post incorrectly implied the HuffPost model had Clinton winning Florida by 5 or 6 points. The forecast shows her winning by that much nationally.Sign up to get Ryan Grim’s Bad News in your inbox."

When Ali walked up to accept her own prize, the visibly excited 10-year-old stood beside her attorney, looked down at the ground often and occasionally offered a gleaming smile to an audience that included Tyra Banks, Michael Bloomberg and Jane Goodall. “I hope that when I return to Yemen, I will learn the law and I will learn English, in order to return here to study and work for a new future for all children and all humanity,” Ali said. Then Katie Couric handed her an award.Clinton wanted to know more about Ali and her lawyer. She had her team reach out. Then she went over to their hotel for an hour-long chat.“I loved her instantly,” Ali told HuffPost in a Friday interview. “But I don’t have her phone number or email … can you connect me with Hillary?”Eight years after that meeting, observers from Teen Vogue to Daily Kos tout Clinton’s emails about Ali as evidence of the deep compassion they say she doesn’t get enough credit for. One message in particular has been shared widely on social media: a note that Clinton privately sent an aide nine months after her meeting with Ali, asking about ways to help the Yemeni girl further. “I hope there’s something we can do,” the then-secretary of state wrote. She was happy to hear an update on Ali’s situation a few days later, another email shows.Clinton’s fans see her continued commitment to Ali as evidence for their narrative. Clinton made it a point to meet Ali again, two years after the emails, when she visited Yemen. Her schedule from a seven-hour-trip to the capital, Sanaa, includes 15 minutes promised to “activists dedicated to ending child marriage” ― namely Ali and her lawyer, Shada Nasser. Nasser said she’s still impressed by that moment, and proud to have been part of it. Clinton was to address a conference hall filled with hundreds of people, including the biggest names in Yemeni activism, right after their meeting, “but the first people who met her were Nujood and I,” Nasser told HuffPost.But the facts about Ali’s life since she met Clinton complicate this feel-good story. They don’t expose any Clinton malice or wrongdoing. But Yemen, where Ali still lives, is now in the midst of a bloody civil war in which Clinton’s ally, President Barack Obama, is playing a controversial, violent role. And Ali’s experience there since her days of international celebrity shows how good intentions often shrivel in the face of class barriers, social pressures and the tangles of U.S. foreign policy ― as well as how fraught it is to use moments in non-Western lives to score Western political points.Ali’s life improved rapidly after her high-profile divorce. Press coverage, Nasser’s advocacy and support from well-wishers ensured she was comfortably re-settled with her parents and returned to school months before she met Clinton. “I want to be an example for all the other girls,” she told the Los Angeles Times in June 2008.The French public seemed especially interested in Ali, thanks to a story from Delphine Minoui, a reporter with the French newspaper Le Figaro. A publisher asked her to talk to the young Yemeni for a book. Minoui agreed, on two conditions: first, that she be allowed to spend significant time with Ali, her family, Nasser and the judge in the case; and second, that the publisher, Michel Lafon, reserve the vast majority of profits to support Ali’s education. Ali’s father had pulled her out of the second grade, saying a forced child marriage was her best chance at a good life, and she was keen to return to her studies and become a lawyer. (Ali declined to respond to questions about her personal life, so portions of this story rely on other sources.)Nasser was optimistic about Ali’s future when the pair traveled to New York for the Glamour Awards. But in their meeting with Clinton, the lawyer said Ali still needed one big favor that the influential American could provide: She had to leave Yemen, and ideally live somewhere away from her family. “Her family don’t help her. They only try to abuse her,” Nasser explained to Clinton.Ali stayed in Yemen, however; the L.A. Times reported that she likely wanted to live with her parents because of her relationship with her younger sister.“Nujood started being surrounded by unscrupulous people and a lot of opportunists who just wanted to make money, sort of a little Mafia,” Minoui told HuffPost. “A lot of bad rumors started being spread out ... including stuff saying that [Nasser] went to visit Hillary with Nujood and came back with suitcases of dollars.”Clinton’s team remained in touch with Nasser because of the secretary’s interest in ending child marriage, the lawyer said, but Clinton was likely unaware of the specific developments in Ali’s case. In August of 2009, Ali told a CNN team that she was furious that her international prominence had not translated to material improvements in her life. She was skipping school in her rage. That segment prompted Clinton’s now-widely shared email asking for Melanne Verveer, her ambassador-at-large for global women’s issues, to check in. Verveer reported that Minoui was paying for Ali’s school fees (something she confirmed to HuffPost, saying it was part of an advance from her publisher) and that Glamour was supporting an initiative to help other underprivileged Yemeni girls.The money wasn’t the trouble, the women around Ali say. They believe her thinking was warped because of her family’s demands and overly high expectations about what her celebrity meant.“I was on the phone every two days, saying, ‘Go to school!’” Minoui said. “As soon as we finished the conversation, she would be under pressure from her dad, [who was] saying, ‘You should demand more money.’”Filmmaker Khadija al-Salami, a fellow former child bride who directed a film featuring Ali’s story and other cases, recalled similar conversations. She had reached out to the girl after reading about her story in the Yemeni news, and she said she personally supported Ali’s school fees for some time. “The problem with Nujood is she became so stubborn ... her sister went to school and she was absent from school. I would call and say, ‘Why are you not going to school?’ She would say, ‘Yes, yes, aunty.’ I would tell her, ‘You’re not going anywhere without education.’ I think the environment, her family and everything, it did not help much,” al-Salami told HuffPost.Still, Ali remained interested in the powerful women she had come to know, regularly speaking of Nasser and Clinton as role models, according to Minoui.Things started to look better in 2010. The book came out, proceeds began to flow and the New Yorker covered Nasser’s work on Ali’s behalf. But by the time Clinton met Ali and Nasser again in Yemen on Jan. 11, 2011, the girl’s future remained uncertain. She did not raise her complaints about her treatment to Clinton, Nasser said. “She only mentioned her dreams, that she wants to be a lawyer, not about her benefits or about her not going to school.”Clinton “came to see me in 2011,” Ali told HuffPost. “I had a good connection with her and I liked her a lot. ... I liked her a lot because she cares about my story. She invited me to go to America.”The following month, Clinton praised the two Yemeni women in an essay for Glamour, calling Ali one of her heroes and saying she was enrolled in school. “When I first met Nujood and Shada two years ago, I was struck by their courage and by the power of their inspiring story. It seems I wasn’t the only one. These young women have brought hope to those suffering inside forced marriages. They have raised awareness of the emotional, psychological, educational, economic and even physical dangers of marrying too early in life. And they have inspired so many of us to redouble our efforts to protect young girls like Nujood,” she wrote.Minoui and Nasser believe that Clinton’s interest in Ali mattered a great deal, regardless of the way Ali’s journey turned out. The secretary kept the issue of child marriage in the news, and her family’s Clinton Foundation continues to combat it internationally. “She didn’t need to look for the little girl when she went to Sanaa,” the French reporter noted. The Clinton campaign declined to comment.Ali never finished her education. She is now almost 19. (Estimates of her age vary, and she says she is not sure of it herself.) She has had to battle her father for some of the money owed to her from the royalties of the book and for possession of the home the French publisher bought for her. Her father still lives in the house, and he has used some of Ali’s money to marry a third wife.In 2014, Ali remarried. She now has two daughters of her own.Today, Ali’s family is enduring a fresh challenge ― one Clinton could play a major role in solving. Like millions of Yemenis, they are caught in the war between a Saudi-led coalition trying to restore the country’s government and Iran-backed rebels who want to change it. The U.S. is playing a major role in the conflict, refueling coalition jets that have been linked to multiple reports of war crimes. The Obama administration claims it is reviewing its support for the coalition, but its confused line on the war seems mostly about deflecting criticism over it until a new president decides which course the U.S. should take. Ali traveled to Saudi Arabia for treatment last year after she developed tuberculosis, Nasser said. She is now back in Yemen, where medical supplies and food are running low as daily airstrikes damage infrastructure.Clinton, Ali says, will fix her country’s woes.“The moment I heard that she would be nominated as U.S. president, I thought things would definitely improve in Yemen. For sure,” she said.Nasser shares Ali’s optimism, saying the U.S. can easily exert pressure on the Saudis to end their bombing and dismissing the idea that Clinton may go easy on them given her belief in supporting traditional U.S. alliances. “The White House is the White House,” she said. The lawyer, an icon in Yemen, thinks Americans, particularly women, must vote for Clinton because of her accomplishments and her potential to inspire girls around the world.For Ali, a President Clinton means a more peaceful life.“She stands with Yemen. It’s clear that she would help Yemen. “Sara Elkamel contributed reporting.Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

83,HEALTHY LIVING,13 Questions That Will Change Your Life,"Dr. Travis Bradberry, ContributorAuthor of #1 bestselling book, Emotional Intelligence 2.0, and...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/13-questions-that-will-ch_b_12674118.html,"Life, like business, runs on questions, not answers. Let's take a closer look at some of the tough questions we should be asking ourselves regularly.",2016-11-05,2016-10-27-1477585670-9935054-13QuestionsThatWillChangeYourLifeHP,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-10-27-1477585670-9935054-13QuestionsThatWillChangeYourLifeHP-thumb,"When things aren't going quite the way you'd like them to, it's often the result of not asking yourself the right questions. Some questions are hard to confront because you're afraid you won't get the answer you want, others because you really don't want to know the answer.But the best things in life don't come easily, and turning away from life's toughest questions is a sure path to mediocrity. I believe that Socrates said it best: ""The unexamined life isn't worth living."" Socrates' observation also applies to business. When Eric Schmidt was CEO of Google, he famously said, ""We run this company on questions, not answers.""Life, like business, runs on questions, not answers. Let's take a closer look at some of the tough questions we should be asking ourselves regularly.  1. How do people see me differently than I see myself?Have you ever heard a recording of your voice and thought, ""Is that what I really sound like?"" Because of the way the sound of the voice travels through the human skull, we never hear ourselves the same way that everybody else hears us. The same is often true for the way we behave. We interpret our behavior in terms of how we think we come across, whereas everyone else sees the real thing. A 360° assessment is a great way to gain this perspective. It gathers feedback that is constructive, anonymous, and accurate. If you forego the 360 and solicit feedback in person, make certain you ask for feedback that is specific, avoiding broad questions and generalizations. For example, you're more likely to get an honest and accurate answer to, ""How well did I handle myself in the meeting when everyone disagreed with me?"" than to, ""Am I a good boss?"" And be careful to show that you're receptive to the feedback. If you flip out or get defensive every time somebody speaks their mind, due to a lack of emotional intelligence, they're going to stop doing it.2. What/whom did I make better today?That's another way of saying, ""Leave things better than you found them."" Ending each day by asking yourself what or whom you made better is a great way to keep yourself grounded and focused on what really matters.  3. Am I being true to my values?Do you ever get that nagging feeling that something is a little off in your life? This often happens when little behaviors creep up on you that violate your values. If spending quality time with your family is one of your primary values, but you keep staying late at work, there's a conflict. If you want that nagging little voice to go away, you're going to have to do something about it.4. If I achieved all of my goals, how would I feel? What can I do to feel that way as I work to achieve them?The ability to delay gratification in pursuit of your goals is one of the most fundamental prerequisites for success, but delaying gratification doesn't have to mean being miserable until you cross that finish line. You can achieve more--and have more fun doing it--if you let yourself feel some of that pride and pleasure along the way.5. What haven't I taken the time to learn about?It's a big world out there, and it's getting bigger all the time. Scientists have theorized that it once took 1,500 years for the accumulated knowledge in the world to double; now it only takes a year or two. Don't get caught behind.6. In what areas of my life am I settling?When you settle, you accept less than you're capable of. Sometimes we settle in dead-end jobs. Other times we settle for unhealthy relationships. If you don't ask yourself where and why you're settling, it's hard to stop it.7. What do I want my life to be like in five years?Lewis Carroll once said, ""If you don't know where you're going, any road will take you there."" The corollary is that, once you have your destination in mind, you can plan your route. Five years is the perfect timeframe: It's not so far in the future that you can't imagine yourself there, but it's not so close that you can't do anything about it.8. What would I do if I wasn't scared?From a survival perspective, fear has its purpose. It's what keeps us from sticking our hand in the washing machine or any of the million other things that could get us hurt or killed. But fear has a tendency to get carried away. Instead of keeping you safe, it keeps you from improving your life and living your dreams.9. Who has qualities that I aspire to develop?When people have qualities that you admire, it's a great exercise to reflect on these qualities and think about ways that you can incorporate them into your repertoire.  10. What problem are we solving?Have you ever been in a meeting and suddenly realized that not everyone was having the same conversation? Not because people were talking over each other, but because they had different ideas about the purpose of the discussion. Sometimes it helps to put the topic on the whiteboard when you're having a meeting. This makes certain everyone knows why they're there.11. What's stopping me from doing the things that I should be doing?It's easy to shrug your shoulders and say, ""I don't know what to do,"" but that's just an excuse. Most of the time, we know exactly what we should be doing; we just aren't willing to move the obstacles out of the way.12. Will you be my mentor?It's an intimidating question to ask, but few people will turn you down. Everyone likes being looked up to, and it feels good to share our knowledge with others.  13. What's the most important lesson I've learned so far in life? Am I living that lesson?Sometimes life lulls us back into complacency and we're forced to learn a powerful lesson twice. The trouble with this is that it's just as much of a rude awakening the second time around.  Bringing It All TogetherAsking the hard questions can be extremely uncomfortable. But we don't learn and grow by sticking with what's comfortable.What other questions should people be asking? Please share your thoughts in the comments section below, as I learn just as much from you as you do from me."

My partner and I happen to be in the fintech space and we have been ""going after it"" for a little over a year now. When we have time in our day, we sit back and try to look critically at what we have done. If we are being completely honest, it is usually a vendor, a family member, or some other new set of eyes who looks critically at our site and asks, ""Why did you do this?"" or ""Why did you do that?""This exact instance reared its ugly (necessary) head when one of our vendors sent us a screen shot of an Instagram post we had run.He said, rather inquisitively, ""Who created these? An agency or you guys in-house?""We puffed out our chests and answered proudly, ""We did, in-house.""He quipped, ""Yeah, I really hate them.""Thank you.Now Dean and I have always prided ourselves in having secure constitutions, not to mention a great sense of humor, so we did not react as maybe most would with a perfunctory $#%@-bomb. We thought calmly, looked at each other, and said... ""He's right.""When we did a little research and came across an interesting quote:""Most organizations message by the seat of their pants. When you're creating communications, are you making it up as you go along or has your organization taken the time to establish the messaging foundation to ensure you have a clearly crafted message? Every marketing effort - be it a new website, collateral, direct marketing, or a press release needs to be aligned with your company's core message. But first... it needs to be defined. Clearly communicate what makes you and your offerings unique - consistently, across your entire organization."" (http://thethinkagency.com/corporate-messaging/)Now, this seems so pragmatic and simple. Of course, if you were a founder of a company you would understand this. It makes perfect sense. But herein lies the problem. In your first year in business, nothing makes perfect sense. You are trying with every last fiber of your being to create something from scratch, in the most cost efficient manner possible and make sure it works. This simply means you are doing it all yourself. You think you are fairly articulate and know EXACTLY what you are trying to communicate to the public, but the technology is what truly matters. Does your product do what you say it does? With this as your primary mission, it is difficult to think about ""company messaging"" when you are trying to survive another day.When you are liquid enough to make a few key hires, you are genuinely thinking of people who can manage that technology and sales (i.e. bringing money back into the company instead of having it go out all the time). A marketing person who would think about things like a ""clearly crafted message"" is a complete luxury, but, in retrospect, a position that should be thought of sooner than most companies do.Certainly, that was the case in our instance.We had the luxury of an in-house graphics guy who could create these great graphics in a short amount of time. We thought he was a rock star (and still do) and that we were geniuses for being able to put these graphics with a message out there in a short period of time; because that's how your brain works in the vacuum that is your start-up. As we created generation 2.0 of our website, we weren't noticing that our website and the messaging we were creating in-house weren't completely in sync. One had a sleek, modern refined feel, while the other was more cartoon-like. It wasn't until that ill-fated (completely on point and necessary) comment by one of our vendors, ""Yeah, I really hate them"" that forced us to sit back and say, ""Yeah, he's right.""So, while we all want to think we can do everything and have everything under control, perhaps the best tool you can have in your proverbial arsenal is the ability to step back, smile, and admit freely that you got it wrong and how do you fix it going forward.While maybe not a course from business school at Wharton, my partner and I believe an invaluable lesson for all.This post originally appeared on The Whole Magilla and was written by Chris Meyer, co-founder of MagillaLoans.com.Follow Dean Sioukas on Twitter Follow Magilla on Twitter"
85,POLITICS,Republican Congressman All But Closes Door On Voting For Paul Ryan,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/thomas-massie-paul-ryan_us_581cb428e4b0aac62483cf01,And so it begins.,2016-11-04,"Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) said it would be ""very difficult"" for current House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) to get his vote.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/581cba51150000b700531be4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) suggested Friday that he would not vote for current House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) to remain in the job, laying out a number of criteria for the next leader of the House GOP and raising the prospect that other Republicans may soon signal their intention to vote against Ryan on the floor in January.“It would be very difficult for him to get my vote based on what I assume his motives are, which are to run for president in 2020,” Massie told The Huffington Post in a phone conversation.The Kentucky Republican, who voted against Ryan last October and repeatedly led opposition to former Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), emailed a statement to HuffPost where he explained what he thinks the next speaker should do “to restore the constitutional integrity of Congress.”The next Speaker shouldn’t send the House on vacation for five weeks in August unless the appropriations bills are done. The next Speaker needs to make good on the broken promise to give members and the American public time to read the bills. The next Speaker should immediately put a stop to the institutionalized extortion that requires members to pay for their committee assignments with lobbyists’ money. Finally, the next Speaker needs to allow a debate on whether or not to authorize the military conflicts the President has unilaterally engaged us in around the globe.Massie said he was not alone in thinking the next speaker should commit to these principles. “Privately, many members of the Freedom Caucus agree with my assertion that this is what the next speaker needs to do,” said Massie, who is not part of the House Freedom Caucus but is close with a number of the members.Massie wouldn’t promise to vote against Ryan on the floor. “If Paul Ryan has a credible plan for restoring integrity of the House, then he can possibly get my vote,” Massie said. “But I suspect he’s more interested in running for president than making the changes in the House of Representatives.”Members have discussed the idea of conservatives slowly coming out against Ryan in a sort of “drip, drip strategy,” in one Republican’s words, that would consume the news cycle after the election. But Massie isn’t waiting.Asked why he decided to come out against Ryan now, just days before the election, Massie noted that House Republicans vote on leadership positions only a week after voters go to the polls.“It’s time now to talk about the job description of the next speaker,” Massie said.He again mentioned that other members agreed with his general principles, and suggested that others may sign on to this effort. “I expect many of them will wait until the day after the election to say what I’m saying now,” he said.As for Massie, he wants to shape the discussion.“Somebody needs to inject these ideas into the conversation, before it devolves into chaos and people start promising committee assignments,” he said.There has been chatter about Ryan facing opposition from conservatives. They’ve been upset with Ryan not moving appropriations bills through the House, not getting a budget done, and even seeming to oppose GOP nominee Donald TrumpSome have recently said they expect Ryan to just resign. But Ryan has not indicated that he intends to do that. If he didn’t step down, Ryan could force a showdown on the House floor during the speaker election. And he could test the willingness of conservatives to actually vote against him.In response to Massie’s criteria Friday, Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong told HuffPost, “The speaker’s only focus until Election Day is defeating Democrats and protecting our majority, and nothing else.”"

He said he saw Luckhurst return to the scene and assumed the contents of the container were thrown away, although he didn’t know for sure.In July, another officer reported the incident to Luckhurst’s supervisor. After an investigation, two review boards recommended that Luckhurst be suspended indefinitely ― which essentially means fired ― and police Chief William McManus opted to uphold that recommendation last week. The San Antonio City Council received a briefing on the situation Thursday.“This was a vile and disgusting act that violates our guiding principles of ‘treating all with integrity, compassion, fairness and respect,’” said Chief McManus in the department’s statement. “The fact that his fellow officers were so disgusted with his actions that they reported him to Internal Affairs demonstrates that this type of behavior will never be tolerated.”Luckhurst’s lawyer, Ben Sifuentes, told the Express-News that his client will be appealing the suspension, because the alleged sandwich incident never really happened.Sifuentes said Luckhurst joked about giving a sandwich filled with feces to a homeless person, but he never actually did it.This article has been updated to include comment from Luckhurst’s lawyer."

88,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton Drops Into Detroit As Democrats Get Nervous About Black Turnout,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/clinton-black-vote-michigan_us_581d031ee4b0d9ce6fbc2ce2,"GOP nominee Donald Trump visited last week, and some polls are showing a tighter race in Michigan.",2016-11-04,Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton works to shore up support in Michigan at a campaign stop in Detroit on Friday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"DETROIT – With Democrats increasingly nervous about African-American turnout, Hillary Clinton came to majority-black Detroit on Friday to shore up support in a state her campaign is counting on come Tuesday.“I’m so happy to be back in Michigan,” Clinton said to cheers from some 4,000 supporters who had crammed into the Shed 3 downtown market.Clinton’s top aides, meanwhile, sought to downplay the significance of her visit just four days before ballots will start being counted. Their job at this point, they argued, was to lock down states they need to win, even as they have the chance to poach traditionally Republican states like Arizona and Georgia.“Michigan is a state we feel we’ve got a lead on. We want to make sure we hold that lead,” campaign chairman John Podesta told reporters on the short flight from another critical state, Pennsylvania.As for polling and early vote statistics suggesting that African-Americans are not supporting Clinton as enthusiastically as they’d supported President Barack Obama in the two previous presidential elections, Podesta said that wasn’t a useful comparison. Obama was the first black president, he said.“We’re not measuring ourselves to what happened in 2012; we’re measuring ourselves against what it takes to get the electoral votes to win,” Podesta said.For her part, Clinton told her audience that her opponent Donald Trump doesn’t know what he’s talking about when he paints all “inner-city” neighborhoods as places where it’s impossible for residents to walk around without getting shot.“He thinks the lives of black people are all about crime and poverty and despair,” she said. “He has no idea of the strength of the black churches and the vibrancy of black businesses.”She also reminded the crowd of how one of Trump’s duties in his first job was to prevent black people from renting his father’s apartments, and of how he aggressively pushed prosecution for the “Central Park Five,” a group of young people of color who were wrongfully convicted of rape in 1989 and spent years in prison before they were cleared with DNA evidence. “Trump actually said he believes they should still be in prison,” she said, referring the GOP nominee’s comments in a recent interview with CNN.HuffPost Pollster, which aggregates publicly available polls, shows Clinton with a 7.5-point lead in Michigan, although several of the most recent surveys show that she leads by a smaller margin, with one finding just a 3-point race in the state."

The notice also went to several other non-governmental organizations, The Washington Post reported Thursday.Ken Kimmell, president of UCS, said the Oct. 20 letter “signals that the company is planning a massive fishing expedition into UCS’s internal emails and communications with others, including the press.”It comes amid climate fraud investigations by attorneys general in New York and Massachusetts. Exxon claims those probes are politically motivated.Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers told The Huffington Post the request for environmental groups to preserve documents is “focused on groups or individuals directly involved in a campaign to discredit our company using false allegations and mischaracterizations of the company’s history of climate research and communications with investors.”“It’s important that no documents are destroyed relating to their years of effort to discredit our company,” he said in an email.Last November, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman subpoenaed Exxon to obtain documents related to allegations that it had lied to the public and its investors. Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey joined the probe in March.The battle that has ensued has been nothing short of a whirlwind. In June, Exxon filed a lawsuit against Healy in an effort to bar a civil investigative demand from her office.Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas), who has a long history of denying climate change, has defended the oil and gas corporation at every turn. Smith has issued subpoenas, including to the UCS and other environmental groups. He’s also claimed the New York and Massachusetts probes “amount to a form of extortion” and are a “blatant effort to silence free speech.” In their recent letters to UCS and others, Exxon lawyers requested the groups keep all communications that may be discoverable evidence in pending or future litigation, including the ongoing lawsuit against Healey. These include emails and text messages between the environmental groups and a variety of other parties ― namely state attorneys general, former Vice President Al Gore, Bill McKibbon, co-founder of the environmental group 350.org, and attorney Sharon Y. Eubanks, the former lead counsel for the Justice Department in federal tobacco litigation. The request also specifically mentions communications with journalists.Kimmel said its unclear how the Exxon lawyers’ letter relates to the oil giant’s legal disputes with state attorneys general. “It appears to be yet another effort to intimidate us from exposing climate science deception,” he said in an email.Jeffers, however, said Exxon has been left with no choice but to defend itself against probes that he called “biased, in bad faith and without legal merit.” In his email, Jeffers included a link to a draft agenda for a January meeting of environmental group leaders at the Rockefeller Family Fund. First covered by The Wall Street Journal in April and later published on the conservative website The Washington Free Beacon, the letter appears to list several of the meeting participants’ common goals, including “to establish in the public’s mind that Exxon is a corrupt institution that has pushed humanity (and all creation) toward climate chaos and grave harm.”“We did not start this,” Jeffers told HuffPost. “But we will see it through and will vigorously defend ourselves.”In a statement last month related to its request that a federal judge throw out Schneiderman’s subpoena, Exxon said it had publicly recognized the risk of climate change for more than a decade. Surfaced documents, however, seem to tell a much different story. A coalition called AGs United for Clean Power formed in the spring, after InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times reported that Exxon executives were aware of the climate risks associated with carbon dioxide emissions but funded research to cover up those risks and block solutions.An investigation by the Washington-based Center for International Environmental Law uncovered documents showing that the oil industry, including Humble Oil (now Exxon), was aware of the potential link between fossil fuels and carbon emissions no later than 1957. And Big Oil was “shaping science to shape public opinion” as early as the 1940s, the report found.The Securities and Exchange Commission is also investigating how Exxon Mobil values future projects amid climate change and plunging oil prices."
90,POLITICS,Did Democrats Back The Wrong Candidate In Pennsylvania?,Michael McAuliff,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/joe-sestak-senate-pennsylvania_us_581cf5cae4b0d9ce6fbc17f6,"A poll says that Joe Sestak, whom Democrats spent millions of dollars to beat, would be doing better now than Senate nominee Katie McGinty.",2016-11-04,"Katie McGinty, second from left, chats with Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in Philadelphia, Oct. 22, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/581cfd32190000a502c3100e.jpeg?cache=ax39zYhZVZ&ops=crop_30_20_4994_2894%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Democrats spent millions of dollars in their own primary in Pennsylvania to elevate Katie McGinty as their standard-bearer against GOP Sen. Pat Toomey. But a poll sent to The Huffington Post on Friday suggests that the guy Democrats pushed out ― former Rep. Joe Sestak ― might have been doing better at this point.The survey, conducted by the firm Gravis Marketing, claims that Sestak would be leading Toomey 48 percent to 44 percent if he were the Democratic nominee, while voters give McGinty a slim 46 to 45 percent lead. Even John Fetterman ― the mayor of Braddock, Pennsylvania, and the progressive alternative from the Democratic primary ― would only be losing to Toomey by 2 points, according to the Gravis data.Several Democratic insiders dismissed the poll as simply divorced from reality, and they may have a point. Gravis is not terribly well-regarded in the polling community (it has a B-minus in 538’s ratings and tends to lean Republican), and this particular survey is missing some standard features that usually help pollsters get a more accurate idea of the data.The poll also comes as McGinty has been buffeted by tens of millions of dollars in negative campaign ads.Still, the Gravis poll will no doubt be of interest to liberal critics who think the party should have just let voters and local Democrats decide the Pennsylvania Senate primary. Insiders argue that Washington Democrats had been willing to accept Sestak, and even met with him early to help out. But they say he showed them no evidence that he was going to build the kind of organization he needed to beat Toomey, who bested Sestak six years ago.The data also suggests the party might have been fine taking a chance on Fetterman, a progressive outsider in the Bernie Sanders mold. While Fetterman isn’t the most widely recognized name, he outperformed all the polls in the primary, finishing with 20 percent of the votes when most surveys had him in the single digits. Fetterman has since embraced the McGinty campaign, and become one of her best surrogates on the campaign trail. The Gravis poll shows him with the highest popularity ratings of the bunch.The question may be moot, however. According to HuffPost Pollster’s aggregate tally of all Pennsylvania polls, McGinty has almost a 4-point lead over Toomey.Still, the race in Pennsylvania is one of the key contests in determining which party controls the Senate next year. If Democrats don’t grab that seat back from the GOP, there’s likely to be much second-guessing of what they could and should have done differently in that race.Gravis said its survey measured 2,800 registered voters on Oct. 28 and 29, and has a margin of error of plus or minus 1.9 percent."
91,POLITICS,Majority Of Black Voters Say The Stakes Are Higher In 2016,Laura Barrón-López,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-voters-2016-important_us_581caef7e4b0e80b02c95c93,"Despite a 34 point drop in enthusiasm, 56 percent of African-Americans consider this presidential election more important than the 2012 race.",2016-11-04,"A woman fills out her ballot during early voting at a polling station inside Truman College on Oct. 31, 2016 in Chicago.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/581cb3c1190000a304c30ee4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― African-Americans aren’t happy about the presidential election, but then again, who is? Enthusiasm among black voters has dropped 34 points from 2012, according to new polling released Friday.But 56 percent of African-Americans across the country say voting in 2016 is more important than it was in 2012, when President Barack Obama ran for his second term. The African American Research Collaborative says that fact is getting lost in the noise surrounding the race between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton ― who have been two of the most disliked candidates in recent history.The collaborative ― an organization of pollsters, scholars and researchers working to provide a more accurate understanding of African-American civic engagement ― surveyed 1,200 African-Americans. They oversampled in Georgia, Pennsylvania and Nevada to provide a more detailed look at various African-American populations in those states. Broken down, 300 people answered the 20-minute poll across the U.S., and 300 people responded in each of the three states that were oversampled. The poll, which was conducted Oct. 25 to Nov. 2, follows reports that early voting among African-Americans is down from 2012 in key states like North Carolina and Florida ― an unwelcome sign for Clinton. Roger Vann, executive director of the nonpartisan civic engagement organization State Voices, attributed the low turnout in states like North Carolina mostly to newly passed laws that impede voters of color and a clampdown on early voting sites. “People understand the critical moment that we are in,” Vann told The Huffington Post. “Even though we don’t have an African-American at the top of ticket, African-Americans are embracing the moment like other Americans, and that is very encouraging.”“There are still significant challenges around turnout for African-Americans in early voting,” Vann continued, pointing to voter suppression substantiated through the legal process. “What this poll shows is that, on average, African-Americans are participating in high rates and planning to vote on Tuesday.”The AARC poll also found that 86 percent of African-Americans surveyed nationally are “absolutely certain” to vote, and 22 percent have voted already. Of the 300 people surveyed in Pennsylvania ― where African-Americans make up 10 percent of the population ― 91 percent said they are “absolutely certain” to vote this year.Henry Fernandez, who has advised political and advocacy campaigns for three decades and helped with data collection for the poll, pointed to the difference between how important voting is to respondents this cycle versus how enthusiastic they are about it. “As the race becomes more negative, both candidates become less popular,” Fernandez said in an interview. “But we distinguish that from the importance of the vote.”Fifty-four percent of those surveyed said they were more enthusiastic about voting in 2012, and the primary reason is because they don’t like either presidential candidate. Still, 70 percent of African-Americans questioned in Pennsylvania say casting a ballot is more important this year than in 2012, compared to 67 percent in Nevada and 62 percent in Georgia. “That’s pretty striking, if you think about it,” Fernandez said. “[It means] the negative nature of campaigns and perception of candidates may not have nearly the kind of effect on actual turnout we think it would.”The survey also questioned respondents about the criminal justice system, immigration reform and marriage equality. An overwhelming majority of respondents nationally (93 percent) said they perceive the criminal justice system to be unfair to minorities. Support for marriage equality increased to 61 percent from 50 percent in 2012. Additionally, 89 percent of black voters are in favor of comprehensive immigration reform. “African-Americans are increasingly rock-steady in support of progressive policy issues,” Fernandez said. “In the past, there have been efforts to try to convince the African-American community that theses issues are not in their interest, and what we’re seeing in this poll are that African-Americans are very, very supportive of LGBTQ rights and very supportive of the rights of immigrants ― more so than the population at large and at levels that we see among Latinos.”The sample was gathered based on Catalist VoteProp v2 scores greater than 30 and includes post 2012 registrants. People were questioned via landline, mobile phone and online to ensure wide coverage and a sufficient sample of millennials. The margin of error for the entire sample of 1,200 blacks is +/- 2.8 percent. The margin of error for each state and the national sample is +/- 5.8 percent, respectively.This story has been updated with additional comment from Henry Fernandez.HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

92,POLITICS,Mike Pence Endorses Paul Ryan After Repeatedly Avoiding The Question,Kate Abbey-Lambertz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mike-pence-paul-ryan_us_581ca706e4b0e80b02c94f60,He only needed to be asked four times.,2016-11-04,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's feud with House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has made life difficult for Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/581caa051600002e002c8699.jpeg?cache=Sd4RsELQMJ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Republican vice presidential nominee and Indiana Gov. Mike Pence said this week that he supports “personal friend” House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) ― but only after he was called out for dodging the question.  In a National Review profile published Thursday, Tim Alberta writes that “Pence declined three times to answer the question of whether Ryan should be reelected as speaker.”“I’m not a member of the House Republican conference anymore,” Pence told Alberta. “I wouldn’t presume upon what the members of the conference choose.”Later in the day, CNN asked Pence whether he supports Ryan, and Pence finally said yes. “My respect for Paul Ryan is boundless and I support his re-election to Congress, and I support his re-election as speaker of the House,” he said. Pence is scheduled to campaign with Ryan and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) on Saturday in Wisconsin, according to Politico.  “We are so grateful for Paul Ryan’s support for this ticket,” Pence said on CNN. Ryan’s “support” has not been unequivocal: He has condemned Republican nominee Donald Trump on several occasions after Trump made combative or bigoted remarks. At the same time, Ryan has not formally withdrawn his endorsement of Trump, and he said this week that he has already voted for him.Trump, for his part, has responded to Ryan’s criticism with attacks of his own, calling the speaker “very weak and ineffective” and “a man who doesn’t know how to win.”National Review has more on how the feud has caused a rift between Ryan and Pence:And then there’s Paul Ryan. He and Pence served together in the House and remain so close that Pence asked the speaker to introduce him at the Republican convention. When Trump initially declined to endorse Ryan in his August primary, Pence made a rare public break with his running mate, telling Fox News, “I believe we need Paul Ryan in leadership in the Congress of the United States.” But the prolonged feud between Trump and Ryan has tested Pence’s loyalties.In particular, Pence was “vexed” by Ryan’s reaction after a 2005 recording of Trump making extremely lewd comments about women leaked last month, according to the conservative magazine.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
