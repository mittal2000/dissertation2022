0,POLITICS,Trump's Controversial Pick For DOJ Civil Rights Chief Appears Headed For Confirmation,Ryan J. Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/eric-dreiband-doj-civil-rights-trump_us_59b0230be4b0b5e53102fb4a,Eric Dreiband has drawn fierce opposition from civil rights organizations.,2017-09-06,Eric Dreiband appeared before members of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59b037291700001f002888ba.png?ops=crop_36_2_537_205%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The corporate lawyer President Donald Trump nominated to lead a key division of the Department of Justice appears headed toward confirmation, despite opposition from civil rights groups that say he’s unfit for the job.Trump nominated Eric Dreiband, an attorney at Jones Day, to take over as head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, which was founded 60 years ago this week. Dreiband previously served at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission under former President George W. Bush.Dreiband appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, where Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-N.Y.), Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) questioned him on issues like voting, LGBTQ rights and hate crimes. Dreiband, a former football player who tried out for the NFL after he graduated from Princeton, has worked as a labor lawyer and has represented corporations being sued for discrimination. He used his testimony to issue a strong condemnation of neo-Nazis, white supremacy and the Ku Klux Klan, which he said should be “eradicated” from the country. But senators had limited time to question Dreiband amid a busy slate of hearings for several other judicial candidates, meaning they had less opportunity to drill into his record. As a result, there were no indications during Wednesday’s hearing that Dreiband will face much Republican opposition, let alone enough to prevent his confirmation.A number of groups criticized the Senate Judiciary Committee ― chaired by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) ― for scheduling so many nominees on a single day.Holding the hearings with so many nominees “deeply undermines the vetting process,” said Marge Baker, executive vice president for the progressive advocacy group People For the American Way.The Civil Rights Division is often at the center of public controversy, and that’s certainly been true during the early months of the Trump administration. Under Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the Justice Department has backed away from investigating patterns of misconduct at law enforcement agencies; reversed the department’s position on key voting rights cases; said that the law doesn’t protect gay people from discrimination; and rescinded protections for transgender students.Advocacy groups and other critics cited Dreiband’s professional background as they spoke out against his nomination. Nan Aron, president of the liberal Alliance for Justice, said he had “spent his professional life opposing the rights of people facing discrimination on the job.” The Congressional Black Caucus wrote that choosing Dreiband “follows President Trump’s agenda of tapping the fox to guard the henhouse.”Dreiband had “no known experience in the Division’s core issue areas, such as voting rights and hate crimes” the group stated in a press release, adding that he “devoted the vast majority of his career to defending corporations accused of employment discrimination.”Vanita Gupta, who headed up the Civil Rights Division during the Obama administration, said Dreiband’s record “shows he is the wrong person” to lead the Civil Rights Division.“The leader of that division must have an allegiance to civil rights, and not to the president or a political party,” Gupta said. “This is particularly true given the Trump-Pence administration’s open hostility to, and demonstrated record of undermining, our core civil rights.”Dreiband’s nomination should be shot down unless he’d change the Trump Justice Department’s positions, said Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.“Unless Eric Dreiband is willing to reverse destructive actions taken by the Attorney General and can commit to restoring civil rights enforcement across the Division, his nomination must be rejected,” Clarke said."

Robert E.

Mariann Edgar Budde, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, Rev. Randolph Marshall Hollerith, the cathedral’s dean, and John Donoghue, chair of the board of directors, said the decision came after two years of discussion and deliberation. The cathedral’s board voted it into effect on Tuesday.“There are a lot of people who have felt alienated from the cathedral because of these windows,” Kevin Eckstrom, the cathedral’s chief communications officer, told HuffPost on Wednesday. “We don’t want anybody to have to check their identity or their history or their beliefs at the door when they come here.”As a central hub for the U.S.-based Episcopal Church, the cathedral has hosted many prominent events over the years, including presidential funerals and inaugural events, most recently for President Donald Trump.The Confederate-themed windows date back to 1953, when they were installed as a gift from the United Daughters of the Confederacy. They depict scenes from the two generals’ lives, as well as a representation of the Confederate battle flag.The United Daughters of the Confederacy did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.Former cathedral dean Gary Hall had previously called for the windows’ removal in 2015, after a white supremacist known to admire Confederate symbols and history killed nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina.“In 2015, we know that celebrating the lives of these two men, and the flag under which they fought, promotes neither healing nor reconciliation, especially for our African-American sisters and brothers,” Hall told Religion News Service at the time.In August, two days after violence erupted in Charlottesville, Virginia, as white supremacists rallied against the removal of a statue of Gen. Robert E. Lee, Hall reposted his earlier call on Facebook, commenting: “Just sayin’.”Responding to a critic who suggested the windows’ removal would be akin to removing the face of slave-owning presidents from Mount Rushmore ― an argument Trump has also made ― Hall wrote:“These monuments were designed and paid for by the United Daughters of the Confederacy in the 1950s to rebrand the confederacy and distract from the issue of slavery and civil rights. They are not innocent.”Eckstrom also addressed the question of historical erasure, saying: “One of the common misunderstandings is that we’ll take the windows down and either throw them away or give them away. Actually we’re planning on preserving them and returning them to the cathedral in some way in a non-sacred place so they can have a second life as an educational tool.”Cathedral leaders said they will deliberate further to determine what will replace the windows.Surveys have found that Americans are generally unsupportive of attempts to remove memorials honoring Confederate leaders. One HuffPost/YouGov poll conducted in August found that one-third of Americans favor removing statues and memorials of Confederate leaders, with 49 percent opposed. Just 29 percent of Americans favor changing the names of streets, schools and buildings commemorating Confederate leaders, while half are opposed. Responses to similar surveys varied, based on how the question was asked and what different options were provided.Several states, including North Carolina, Alabama and Mississippi, have laws on the books that make it particularly difficult to remove symbols of the Confederacy. In other places, local officials have worked swiftly to remove Confederate monuments without drawing attention from white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups.With memories of the violence in Charlottesville still fresh, Eckstrom said the cathedral’s windows will be removed judiciously in a process that may take several days.“Safety is a big concern for us, and it has been throughout this process,” he said. “We’re trying to do this in as dignified and safe a way as possible. We don’t really know what to expect, but have tried to plan for a number of scenarios.”Removing the windows is a symbolic action that will hopefully underscore ongoing racial justice efforts, Eckstrom added, reiterating the cathedral’s official statement.“We’re not just talking about windows here,” Eckstrom said. “We’re talking about racial justice and the legacy of slavery and the role of the church in that. After the windows are gone, we’re hoping to rally the attention around the harder work of racial reconciliation.”"

3,POLITICS,States Hope Trump's Own Bigoted Words And Tweets Will Help Keep DACA Alive,Ryan J. Reilly and Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/daca-lawsuit-trump_us_59b05150e4b0354e440f053a,"Yet again, Trump's own words could come back to haunt him in court.",2017-09-06,Donald Trump's own words on the campaign trail and in office may provide the best arguments against his decision to end DACA.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59b0521d1400001f00fa852b.jpeg?cache=zI5JxULqK1&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The coalition of states challenging President Donald Trump’s decision to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals is leaning on a tried-and-true method of undermining legal defenses of Trump’s executive actions: They’re pointing to his own words.A lawsuit filed by 15 states and the District of Columbia on Wednesday that challenges the recision of DACA, which protects certain undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children, extensively refers to statements and tweets in Trump’s campaign and presidency that it says display anti-Mexican bias. The evidence: Trump referred to Mexican immigrants as rapists, he kicked a Univision reporter out of his news conference, he called protesters carrying Mexican flags “criminals” and “thugs,” he impugned the integrity of a federal judge because of his Mexican descent, he promised to deport “bad hombres,” and he pardoned Joe Arpaio, the former Arizona sheriff accused of targeting Latinos. Those Trump statements came from speeches, interviews, tweets and, in one case, a leaked transcript of his discussion with the president of Mexico in which Trump also used the term “bad hombres.”The lawsuit claims that the statements show Trump “has a long history of disparaging Mexicans,” who comprise most of the DACA grantees, and has “demonstrated a willingness to disparage Mexicans in a misguided attempt to secure support from his constituency, even when such impulses are impermissible motives for directing governmental policy.” Trump’s words have come back to haunt him in court before. Groups challenging Trump’s travel ban orders pointed to his anti-Muslim statements as evidence of his motivation. One judge said in March that Trump provided “significant and unrebutted evidence of religious animus” and said his words betrayed his administration’s claim that the travel bans were not aimed at Muslims.Ending DACA would affect hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. from Mexico. Of the nearly 800,000 undocumented immigrants who have received work permits and protections under DACA, more than 78 percent are of Mexican origin, according to the complaint. The lawsuit alleges that ending the program “is a culmination of Trump’s oft-stated commitments ― whether personally held, stated to appease some portion of his constituency, or some combination thereof ― to punish and disparage people with Mexican roots.”Among other allegations, the lawsuit contends that Trump’s actions violate the Fifth Amendment by denying equal protection of the laws. Trump’s “numerous statements about his intentions towards Mexicans” target individuals “for discriminatory treatment based on their national origin, without lawful justification,” the lawsuit claims. Trump and U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions argued they had to rescind the program because it would not stand up to a legal challenge threatened by other states, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. Citing a policy against discussing pending litigation, the White House declined to comment on the 15-state lawsuit filed Wednesday in New York (at least four other states have expressed support for DACA). A Department of Justice spokesman said the agency will defend the policy change in court. “As the Attorney General said yesterday: ‘No greater good can be done for the overall health and well-being of our Republic, than preserving and strengthening the impartial rule of law.’ While the plaintiffs in today’s lawsuits may believe that an arbitrary circumvention of Congress is lawful, the Department of Justice looks forward to defending this Administration’s position,” Justice Department spokesman Devin O’Malley said in a statement."
4,WOMEN,'The Bold Type' Creator On Tackling Sexual Assault In The Show's Hopeful Finale,Emma Gray,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-bold-type-creator-on-tackling-sexual-assault-in-the-shows-hopeful-finale_us_59aef2b8e4b0dfaafcf33abc,"""It’s just women supporting women.""",2017-09-06,"Jane (middle) and Kat (right) interview Mia Lawrence during ""The Bold Type's"" season finale.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59aef8b71b000028005b4a39.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Warning: Spoilers ahead for the season finale of Freeform’s “The Bold Type.”“The Bold Type,” Freeform’s fresh, deeply hopeful show about three women in their mid-20s trying to make it in the insane world of New York media, closed out its first season Tuesday night. (If you have yet to give the show a try, you should. It’s sweeter, deeper and more engaging than the original teasers might have let on.)The series centers around three women who work at Scarlet Magazine ― a thinly veiled fictional version of Cosmopolitan ― and their boss, the ethereal Jacqueline. (Former Cosmo Editor-in-Chief Joanna Coles is an executive producer on the show.) There’s Jane (Katie Stevens), a budding political reporter; Kat (Aisha Dee), Scarlet’s Social Media Director; and Sutton (Meghann Fahy), an executive assistant who finally gets her shot at working in the fashion department. During the show’s finale, Jane is tasked with covering Mia Lawrence, a performance artist and activist who has staged a performance piece in Central Park. Mia carries two physical weights in the shape of scales, meant to represent the metaphorical weight she carries in the wake of being sexually assaulted. Other survivors can come up to her and relieve her of her physical burden for a period of time. (The piece featured in “The Bold Type” is intentionally similar to Columbia student Emma Sulkowicz’s “Carry that Weight,” in which she carried her mattress around campus between September 2014 and May 2015. Sulkowicz said she would stop the endurance performance when her alleged rapist was removed from or left the university. She carried that mattress, with the help of other students, all the way until graduation.) The finale’s climax comes after Jane has made the decision to leave Scarlet. She visits Mia in the park, and though she cannot carry her weight, she stands near her in solidarity. Eventually, Kat and Sutton join her. And finally, Jacqueline arrives, stepping up to reveal that she shares the label of “survivor” with Mia ― and the weight that comes along with that experience. It’s a beautiful image of five women standing with and for each other, made even more touching by the fact that it’s set to singer MILCK’s “Quiet,” an (unofficial) viral anthem of the Women’s March. (See below.)“The Bold Type” isn’t really about Big Messages ― it’s more focused on the arguably smaller interpersonal dynamics between the women at its center ― but the writers also don’t shy away from acknowledging the world that “The Bold Type” is set in. After all, these women live in New York City and work for a news organization in 2017: They report on sexism in politics and climate change policy and the BRCA gene; they have friends and lovers of varying sexual identities and races and countries of origin; they talk about how annoying it is when President Trump causes massive traffic jams. And in the final episode of the season, the women grapple with what it means to survive and thrive in the face of traumas, both big and small.During a time when every day feels like an episode of the worst reality TV show you can imagine, “The Bold Type” provides a welcome antidote. You don’t escape reality when you immerse yourself in Jane and Kat and Sutton’s lives, but you see a kinder version of it. This hopefulness extends to the way the show chose to approach a topic as complex and dark as sexual violence, and the healing process survivors are forced to face.As “The Bold Type” creator Sarah Watson put it to HuffPost: “We always wanted to have an element of wish fulfillment.” HuffPost spoke with Watson, who wrote the moving finale episode, about the choice to build the finale around such a weighty (no pun intended) storyline, as well as the future of the show. HuffPost: I really loved episode 10, “Carry the Weight” ― I got a bit weepy at times. At what point did you decide to craft the finale around this subplot of sexual assault and survivor-hood?Sarah Watson: We didn’t know it was gonna be the finale, but we knew very early in the season that this was a story that we wanted to do. In the first couple weeks in the writer’s room, we started talking about all the girls, and started to think of experiences that they were gonna have as women in their 20s, coming up the ladder in the magazine world. We just started talking about how the experiences you have in your 20s really shape you. And then [we] started talking about Jacqueline ― we started talking about how we’re not gonna be telling as many stories like that in her present, but what was it like for her when she was coming up in the magazine industry? And we discussed how different things were then; that it was tougher to be a woman back then.Even 20 years ago, it was just so much harder to talk about stories [of sexual assault], because [media] was definitely a male-dominated industry. Women didn’t feel that they could come forward. And so, we knew very early that, that’s something we wanted to be a backstory for Jacqueline. I brought Melora [Hardin, who plays Jacqueline] in to talk about her character because I wanted her to know all season long that that was something in the character’s past.What was the significance of having Jacqueline come out as a survivor of sexual assault?The whole season, Jacqueline is a bit of a mystery. We don’t know much about her, other than in episode six when Jane explodes on her and Jacqueline invites her into her home. We wanted this woman to be a bit of a mystery. So, it just felt like the right place to talk about this big experience that obviously shaped her.Did you consult with any sexual assault advocacy organizations to make sure that you were telling this story in a way that was responsible?Absolutely. I spoke [with representatives from] Break The Cycle. With a storyline like this, especially when I’m writing about something that is not my personal experience, I wanted to make sure that I got it right. Obviously, in writing this episode, I’m not speaking for all women who have been through [sexual assault], but I wanted to make sure we were sensitive and making the story as accurate as possible.“Carry the Weight,” the title of this episode, is deeply reminiscent of artist and former Columbia student Emma Sulkowicz’s 2014 project, “Carry that Weight.” I assume that’s kind of where you got the inspiration for the performance art piece featured in the show?Oh yeah. I was definitely inspired by Emma Sulkowicz. I just thought there was something so brave and moving about [what she did]. It was a little more organic when women stepped in to help her carry her mattress, and I just thought there was something so beautiful about [how] this generation steps up and helps each other. Jacqueline had been carrying this weight personally and alone for so long, so to see this new generation step up and really be there to support each other, I thought that was such a beautiful image.Did Emma Sulkowicz know that this episode is coming? Did you reach out to her at all?No, we didn’t. Two of the women I spoke to when we were researching the storyline do know her. I don’t know if they told her or not.In the episode, Jacqueline’s personal experience and trauma plays into the way that she responds to assigning these kind of stories. I found that particularly interesting as someone who works in the women’s media space, because it’s both a privilege and emotionally exhausting to cover stories as a women about women’s trauma, all the time.It’s such a double-edged sword because I think for young journalists, and also as a writer telling fictional versions, there’s something exciting about telling these big, weighty stories but there’s also something very scary about it. And it is a tremendous responsibility. And Jane, this sort of younger reporter, isn’t able to see yet what a tremendous responsibility that is. But I also think it was a little bit unfair that Jacqueline didn’t let Jane do this story on Mia Lawrence right away. Jacqueline was bringing personal experience to it, which is something I think she realizes in the arc of the episode.One of the final scenes ― when the four women (Jane, Kat, Sutton and Jacqueline) are all standing together with Mia in Central Park ― was set to MILCK’s “Quiet.” That’s a song that went viral after it was performed by a group of women at the Women’s March. Was that intentional?So, that came from our music supervisor, Ronald Lowry. He read the script and emailed me right away. First of all, I think he said, “as soon as I’m done sobbing, I want to pitch a song to you.” And I did not know about the song’s connection to the Women’s March, which adds an even more beautiful and complex layer. As soon as we shot that scene, our music editor mixed it to that song and it was just beautiful and perfect.What do you hope that survivors of sexual assault who watch this finale take from it?I could never put myself in their position and I know that every women who is a survivor is gonna have a different reaction to [the episode]. I just hope they feel less alone. That’s what the “carry the weight” message is ― we’re all in this together. Women who are not survivors can still be there. That moment when Jane and Sutton and Kat [who are not survivors] all show up and stand with Mia. We can be there too.Throughout the whole season, “The Bold Type” has consistently taken cues from real-life stories, from media layoffs to Instagram’s nudity policy, to Adena’s rough experiences with U.S. immigration. Did you always plan to integrate, for lack of a better term, “ripped from the headlines” storytelling?It was never a super conscious thing. I just think the nature of them being at a magazine lends itself to that. I wrote on “Parenthood” for six years and our joke was always that “Law and Order” did ripped-from-the-headlines, and we did ripped-from-our-real-lives. And so, on “The Bold Type,” I think it started from us talking about our experiences, and then us talking about the experiences of the women who were actually working at Cosmo. It just felt right to tell these real and grounded stories of what it’s really like to work in a magazine in 2017.And especially given the moment that we’re in, those crossovers might be more apparent. The Trump clogging up traffic in New York jokes hit close to home.Oh yeah, are you in New York right now?Yeah, I am.So, I had stayed at a hotel just a couple blocks from Trump Tower right before we started the writers room and I was there the day that Kanye visited Trump and you just couldn’t go anywhere. And I just thought, “Oh my gosh we have to play the reality of what it’s like to be New Yorker when the President comes to town.”Yeah, and I think no one is angrier than New Yorkers when Trump comes back home. I also enjoy that the show manages to strike a balance between delving into these deeper, darker news-based issues, while still being genuinely fun to watch and lighthearted. Did you have conversations in the writers room about how to strike that balance?We for sure wanted the show to feel very hopeful. So, we always wanted to have an element of wish fulfillment. I think “Friday Night Lights” had it beautifully. Every episode had a character going through something huge and weighty, but at the same time you left those episodes feeling good and feeling like, with your friends, and with coach and family you can face it all together. So, I always wanted to have this feeling of, even though we’re going through these things, we’re all in it together and every story should be approached from this feeling of hopefulness and the feeling that we’re all gonna be OK.Do you consider “The Bold Type” to be a feminist show?Definitely. It’s women supporting women. You know, there’s so much attention right now on defining feminism and who’s a feminist and what’s feminist. And to me, it’s just women supporting women, which is absolutely what this show is.What does that label mean to you when you’re writing a TV show? Does it create an extra responsibility in the way that you’re putting the show together, especially given the tumultuous political moment that we’re in?You know, I try to not think about it because once you feel that extra responsibility, I feel like it’s very easy to go to this preachy, pandering place and I never want the show to go to that. I always want it to feel like it’s from a place of reality. So, just in everything we write, all the writers, we just try to approach it from a place of character and a place realness.I wanted to show what women’s friendships can be, because I feel like so often on TV, we have shows that are about women and their friendships, but drama always come from them turning on each other. And I wanted to show that we can face the drama together ’cause those are the kind of female friendships that I have. If the kind of female friendships that you have are your friends turning on you, go get new friends. And in the writers room, we actually jokingly refer to [the relationships on the show] as “friendship porn.” It’s like we’ve taken the real and grounded friendships and just added a little shine; made them a little stronger than reality.So what can we expect from the show if you get a season two?Oh my gosh. Ask me in a couple weeks. After I’ve had a moment to recover. Ask me when I get a season two. Part of me doesn’t even want to think about it because I don’t want to jinx it. Part of me just wants to lay around on the beach.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity."

Mia carries two physical weights in the shape of scales, meant to represent the metaphorical weight she carries in the wake of being sexually assaulted. Other survivors can come up to her and relieve her of her physical burden for a period of time. (The piece featured in “The Bold Type” is intentionally similar to Columbia student Emma Sulkowicz’s “Carry that Weight,” in which she carried her mattress around campus between September 2014 and May 2015. Sulkowicz said she would stop the endurance performance when her alleged rapist was removed from or left the university. She carried that mattress, with the help of other students, all the way until graduation.) The finale’s climax comes after Jane has made the decision to leave Scarlet. She visits Mia in the park, and though she cannot carry her weight, she stands near her in solidarity. Eventually, Kat and Sutton join her. And finally, Jacqueline arrives, stepping up to reveal that she shares the label of “survivor” with Mia ― and the weight that comes along with that experience. It’s a beautiful image of five women standing with and for each other, made even more touching by the fact that it’s set to singer MILCK’s “Quiet,” an (unofficial) viral anthem of the Women’s March. (See below.)“The Bold Type” isn’t really about Big Messages ― it’s more focused on the arguably smaller interpersonal dynamics between the women at its center ― but the writers also don’t shy away from acknowledging the world that “The Bold Type” is set in. After all, these women live in New York City and work for a news organization in 2017: They report on sexism in politics and climate change policy and the BRCA gene; they have friends and lovers of varying sexual identities and races and countries of origin; they talk about how annoying it is when President Trump causes massive traffic jams. And in the final episode of the season, the women grapple with what it means to survive and thrive in the face of traumas, both big and small.During a time when every day feels like an episode of the worst reality TV show you can imagine, “The Bold Type” provides a welcome antidote. You don’t escape reality when you immerse yourself in Jane and Kat and Sutton’s lives, but you see a kinder version of it. This hopefulness extends to the way the show chose to approach a topic as complex and dark as sexual violence, and the healing process survivors are forced to face.As “The Bold Type” creator Sarah Watson put it to HuffPost: “We always wanted to have an element of wish fulfillment.” HuffPost spoke with Watson, who wrote the moving finale episode, about the choice to build the finale around such a weighty (no pun intended) storyline, as well as the future of the show. HuffPost: I really loved episode 10, “Carry the Weight” ― I got a bit weepy at times. At what point did you decide to craft the finale around this subplot of sexual assault and survivor-hood?Sarah Watson: We didn’t know it was gonna be the finale, but we knew very early in the season that this was a story that we wanted to do. In the first couple weeks in the writer’s room, we started talking about all the girls, and started to think of experiences that they were gonna have as women in their 20s, coming up the ladder in the magazine world. We just started talking about how the experiences you have in your 20s really shape you. And then [we] started talking about Jacqueline ― we started talking about how we’re not gonna be telling as many stories like that in her present, but what was it like for her when she was coming up in the magazine industry? And we discussed how different things were then; that it was tougher to be a woman back then.Even 20 years ago, it was just so much harder to talk about stories [of sexual assault], because [media] was definitely a male-dominated industry. Women didn’t feel that they could come forward. And so, we knew very early that, that’s something we wanted to be a backstory for Jacqueline. I brought Melora [Hardin, who plays Jacqueline] in to talk about her character because I wanted her to know all season long that that was something in the character’s past.What was the significance of having Jacqueline come out as a survivor of sexual assault?The whole season, Jacqueline is a bit of a mystery. We don’t know much about her, other than in episode six when Jane explodes on her and Jacqueline invites her into her home. We wanted this woman to be a bit of a mystery. So, it just felt like the right place to talk about this big experience that obviously shaped her.Did you consult with any sexual assault advocacy organizations to make sure that you were telling this story in a way that was responsible?Absolutely. I spoke [with representatives from] Break The Cycle. With a storyline like this, especially when I’m writing about something that is not my personal experience, I wanted to make sure that I got it right. Obviously, in writing this episode, I’m not speaking for all women who have been through [sexual assault], but I wanted to make sure we were sensitive and making the story as accurate as possible.“Carry the Weight,” the title of this episode, is deeply reminiscent of artist and former Columbia student Emma Sulkowicz’s 2014 project, “Carry that Weight.” I assume that’s kind of where you got the inspiration for the performance art piece featured in the show?Oh yeah. I was definitely inspired by Emma Sulkowicz. I just thought there was something so brave and moving about [what she did]. It was a little more organic when women stepped in to help her carry her mattress, and I just thought there was something so beautiful about [how] this generation steps up and helps each other. Jacqueline had been carrying this weight personally and alone for so long, so to see this new generation step up and really be there to support each other, I thought that was such a beautiful image.Did Emma Sulkowicz know that this episode is coming? Did you reach out to her at all?No, we didn’t. Two of the women I spoke to when we were researching the storyline do know her. I don’t know if they told her or not.In the episode, Jacqueline’s personal experience and trauma plays into the way that she responds to assigning these kind of stories. I found that particularly interesting as someone who works in the women’s media space, because it’s both a privilege and emotionally exhausting to cover stories as a women about women’s trauma, all the time.It’s such a double-edged sword because I think for young journalists, and also as a writer telling fictional versions, there’s something exciting about telling these big, weighty stories but there’s also something very scary about it. And it is a tremendous responsibility. And Jane, this sort of younger reporter, isn’t able to see yet what a tremendous responsibility that is. But I also think it was a little bit unfair that Jacqueline didn’t let Jane do this story on Mia Lawrence right away. Jacqueline was bringing personal experience to it, which is something I think she realizes in the arc of the episode.One of the final scenes ― when the four women (Jane, Kat, Sutton and Jacqueline) are all standing together with Mia in Central Park ― was set to MILCK’s “Quiet.” That’s a song that went viral after it was performed by a group of women at the Women’s March. Was that intentional?So, that came from our music supervisor, Ronald Lowry. He read the script and emailed me right away. First of all, I think he said, “as soon as I’m done sobbing, I want to pitch a song to you.” And I did not know about the song’s connection to the Women’s March, which adds an even more beautiful and complex layer. As soon as we shot that scene, our music editor mixed it to that song and it was just beautiful and perfect.What do you hope that survivors of sexual assault who watch this finale take from it?I could never put myself in their position and I know that every women who is a survivor is gonna have a different reaction to [the episode]. I just hope they feel less alone. That’s what the “carry the weight” message is ― we’re all in this together. Women who are not survivors can still be there. That moment when Jane and Sutton and Kat [who are not survivors] all show up and stand with Mia. We can be there too.Throughout the whole season, “The Bold Type” has consistently taken cues from real-life stories, from media layoffs to Instagram’s nudity policy, to Adena’s rough experiences with U.S. immigration. Did you always plan to integrate, for lack of a better term, “ripped from the headlines” storytelling?It was never a super conscious thing. I just think the nature of them being at a magazine lends itself to that. I wrote on “Parenthood” for six years and our joke was always that “Law and Order” did ripped-from-the-headlines, and we did ripped-from-our-real-lives. And so, on “The Bold Type,” I think it started from us talking about our experiences, and then us talking about the experiences of the women who were actually working at Cosmo. It just felt right to tell these real and grounded stories of what it’s really like to work in a magazine in 2017.And especially given the moment that we’re in, those crossovers might be more apparent. The Trump clogging up traffic in New York jokes hit close to home.Oh yeah, are you in New York right now?Yeah, I am.So, I had stayed at a hotel just a couple blocks from Trump Tower right before we started the writers room and I was there the day that Kanye visited Trump and you just couldn’t go anywhere. And I just thought, “Oh my gosh we have to play the reality of what it’s like to be New Yorker when the President comes to town.”Yeah, and I think no one is angrier than New Yorkers when Trump comes back home. I also enjoy that the show manages to strike a balance between delving into these deeper, darker news-based issues, while still being genuinely fun to watch and lighthearted. Did you have conversations in the writers room about how to strike that balance?We for sure wanted the show to feel very hopeful. So, we always wanted to have an element of wish fulfillment. I think “Friday Night Lights” had it beautifully. Every episode had a character going through something huge and weighty, but at the same time you left those episodes feeling good and feeling like, with your friends, and with coach and family you can face it all together. So, I always wanted to have this feeling of, even though we’re going through these things, we’re all in it together and every story should be approached from this feeling of hopefulness and the feeling that we’re all gonna be OK.Do you consider “The Bold Type” to be a feminist show?Definitely. It’s women supporting women. You know, there’s so much attention right now on defining feminism and who’s a feminist and what’s feminist. And to me, it’s just women supporting women, which is absolutely what this show is.What does that label mean to you when you’re writing a TV show? Does it create an extra responsibility in the way that you’re putting the show together, especially given the tumultuous political moment that we’re in?You know, I try to not think about it because once you feel that extra responsibility, I feel like it’s very easy to go to this preachy, pandering place and I never want the show to go to that. I always want it to feel like it’s from a place of reality. So, just in everything we write, all the writers, we just try to approach it from a place of character and a place realness.I wanted to show what women’s friendships can be, because I feel like so often on TV, we have shows that are about women and their friendships, but drama always come from them turning on each other. And I wanted to show that we can face the drama together ’cause those are the kind of female friendships that I have. If the kind of female friendships that you have are your friends turning on you, go get new friends. And in the writers room, we actually jokingly refer to [the relationships on the show] as “friendship porn.” It’s like we’ve taken the real and grounded friendships and just added a little shine; made them a little stronger than reality.So what can we expect from the show if you get a season two?Oh my gosh. Ask me in a couple weeks. After I’ve had a moment to recover. Ask me when I get a season two. Part of me doesn’t even want to think about it because I don’t want to jinx it. Part of me just wants to lay around on the beach.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity."

8,PARENTS,Controversy Erupts After UK Retailer Removes Gender Labels From Kids' Clothes,Caroline Bologna,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/controversy-erupts-after-uk-retailer-removes-gender-labels-from-kids-clothes_us_59aebad4e4b0dfaafcf2bdd7,Reactions were mixed on Twitter.,2017-09-06,"In addition to the changes in labels, John Lewis also launched a unisex baby and toddler wear line, which features dinosaur dresses, science shirts and more.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59b014f21400001f00fa8442.jpeg?cache=CdmFnZiQJg&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A major U.K. retailer is taking big steps to address the issue of gender stereotyping in children’s clothing. Over the weekend, Twitter erupted following reports that the department store chain, John Lewis, had removed “girls” and “boys” labels from its children’s clothing and signage separating that department into “girls” and “boys” sections.As John Lewis’ head of children’s wear, Caroline Bettis, said in a statement on Monday, “We do not want to reinforce gender stereotypes within our John Lewis collections and instead want to provide greater choice and variety to our customers, so that the parent or child can choose what they would like to wear.” John Lewis also launched a unisex baby and toddler wear line, which features dinosaur dresses, science shirts and more.In response to these reports, many parents, child advocates and activists expressed their joy on Twitter. Several parents noted that their girls often feel embarrassed about wanting to buy clothing designated as for “boys” and vice versa. John Lewis’ system means that all kids can select whatever style of clothing makes them feel comfortable ― whether it’s a floral dress or a space-themed T-shirt ― without the labels of “boy” or “girl” to designate who is supposed to wear each garment.This system also generated criticism as well, with many Twitter users expressing deep outrage at John Lewis’ decision to replace the “boys” and “girls” labels on its children’s clothing with “boys and girls” labels.Piers Morgan declared that “Britain is officially going bonkers.” Conservative Member of Parliament Andrew Bridgen said in an interview, “I have no idea what would possess John Lewis to do this. Boys and girls labels and signs are informative. I think removing them could be very confusing for the consumer.”He added, “It appears political correctness continues to march and, whether it is going in the right direction, is a point for debate. I cannot see many customers buying a dress for their six-year-old boy.”This Twitter uproar has been somewhat confusing to the folks at John Lewis. “We’re surprised by the reaction these changes have received this weekend because they were introduced over a year ago,” a spokesperson for the company told HuffPost, noting that John Lewis introduced non-gender specific labels in its own brand of children’s clothing at the beginning of 2016 and subsequently replaced the “girls” and “boys” signage in stores with photo of children modeling the clothes. The unisex baby wear line was introduced in January 2017. Apparently these earth-shatteringly radical changes went unnoticed for quite some time. “In our shops, girls and boys clothing are still positioned in the same way as they have always been and online customers can search by ‘girl’ or ‘boy’ if they choose to,” the spokesperson added. “As our customers would expect we’re still selling a wide variety of children’s clothing including traditional clothing for girls and boys. We haven’t made any changes to our website but continually review how we display products online to make searching as easy as possible.”Highlighting the purpose of these decisions, the spokesperson concluded, “We want to provide greater choice and variety to our customers so that parents or children can choose what they would like to wear.”Many Twitter users also responded to the critics of John Lewis with clarification, humor and the signature British sarcasm.The organization, Let Clothes Be Clothes ― which focuses on removing gender stereotyping in children’s apparel and marketing ― also issued a statement in response to the John Lewis debate. “The move by John Lewis to remove gender stereotyping is not about gender-less children, it is about gender-less clothes,” states the press release. “The gender neutral term is misleading. It’s not about making all kids the same, it’s acknowledging that all children are different. Selling ‘children’s’ clothes rather than ‘girls’ or ’boys clothes enables children to be themselves without restrictions.”Advocate Cheryl Rickman notes, “Gender neutrality is about giving all children equal opportunities and acknowledging that all children are different and unique.”John Lewis’ commitment to helping kids be individuals with their own interests and tastes marks a big step toward empowering children . The response on social media shows that parents care about these issues and want their children to to feel comfortable as they are.Ultimately, however, one Twitter user addressed the question that’s really on everyone’s mind."

Texas' voter ID law is considered one of the strictest in the U.S.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59af75131700001f00288712.jpeg?cache=by6NvbHXz5&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sept 5 (Reuters) - The state of Texas won at least a temporary victory on Tuesday in its bid to implement a controversial voter identification law when a federal appeals court stayed a ruling by a U.S. district court judge that barred its enforcement.A three-member panel of the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans voted 2-1 to put the lower court judge’s ruling on hold while it considers the constitutionality of the law, which was passed this year by the state’s Republican-controlled legislature.That bill was meant to fix elements of a 2011 voter ID measure that was considered one of the strictest in the United States and subject to years of court challenges during the Obama administration.President Donald Trump, who campaigned on cutting voter fraud, has supported Texas’ bid to require that voters show a form of identification.“The state has made a strong showing that it is likely to succeed on the merits (of the case)” Judges Jennifer Elrod and Jerry Smith wrote in a six-page ruling.In a four-page dissenting opinion, Judge James Graves wrote that if the 5th Circuit was going to take up the case, it should have stayed the entire law from taking effect until a final ruling was issued.Lauren Ehrsam, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Justice, said in a written statement “We are pleased that the Fifth Circuit has stayed the injunction and allowed Texas to proceed with its duly enacted voter identification laws.”“Preserving the integrity of the ballot is vital to our democracy, and the Fifth Circuit’s order allows Texas to continue to fulfill that duty as this case moves forward,” Ehrsam said.Texas Democratic Party Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa could not be reached for comment on the ruling on Tuesday evening.Hiojosa has previously likened the voter ID requirements to “Jim Crow-era tactics” designed to keep Republican lawmakers in power.Critics say the Texas law and similar statutes enacted in other states were tailored to make it harder for minorities and immigrants, including black and Hispanic voters who are less likely to have the authorized IDs and tend to favor Democrats, to cast ballots.Backers say the laws are necessary to prevent voter fraud and are no more onerous than the requirements imposed by states for driving a motor vehicle."
10,IMPACT,Let’s Reduce Loss Of Life From Irma,"A View From The United Nations, ContributorSenior officials speak on global issues",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lets-reduce-loss-of-life-from-irma_us_59b04bc7e4b0d0c16bb52999,Every effort must be made in the coming days to ensure that warnings reach the most marginalised and vulnerable.,2017-09-06,"<p>The Caribbean region, including Haiti, is preparing for the arrival of Hurricane Irma. The region is prone to such climatic events. Shown here, a street in the town of Jeremie, which Hurricane Matthew passed through in October 2016, leaving a trail of destruction.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59b04dd61b000016005b4d9a.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Robert GlasserThe Atlantic hurricane season always poses a deadly threat to some of the most densely populated islands and coastal regions in the world but this year seems destined for the history books.The losses from Hurricane Harvey could turn it into the most expensive single weather event in U.S. history as the country prepares now for the likely arrival of Hurricane Irma and sizes up the possibility of a hit from Jose, a newly formed tropical storm in the mid-Atlantic.Memories are still fresh of the loss of 600 or more lives in Haiti last October from Hurricane Matthew, which made landfall as a category 4 and caused enormous economic losses to the impoverished country still recovering from the 2010 earthquake.Irma is the strongest hurricane ever to form in the Atlantic; warnings have been issued for Florida, parts of Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic and many small island developing states in the Caribbean and, given the size of the threat, there must be a raised concern for the possible loss of life on low-lying coastlines exposed to winds of over 280 kph and significant storm surge.There is nothing like the threat of a major life-threatening disaster to focus attention on disaster management and the greater challenge of how to make progress on eliminating the underlying drivers of disaster events, which is a paradigm shift backed by UN Member States when they adopted the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction two years ago.Key targets outlined in that agreement are to reduce mortality and to reduce the numbers of people affected by disasters by the year 2030 in support of the overall 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.The clear and present danger posed by Hurricane Irma is not from the natural hazard itself but rather from the quality of the built environment which lies in its path and the potential for intensified damage and loss because of rising, warming seas linked to climate change.This simple truth highlights the importance of reducing disaster risk, setting standards for resilient infrastructure, applying appropriate building codes and land use regulations, restoring and preserving protective eco-systems, and putting in place strong institutions for good risk governance.It is clear that poverty is a key driver of disaster risk in sudden on-set events like a hurricane. Though excellent work was done in Haiti last October in disseminating early warnings, many lives were lost and large parts of the subsistence economy were destroyed.It’s a vicious circle. Poverty is a key cause of mortality in events on the scale of Irma as it is those living in marginalised areas who are most vulnerable to disaster impacts. Disasters also worsen poverty making it more difficult to eradicate, a challenge which is the number one Sustainable Development Goal.Every effort must be made in the coming days to ensure that warnings reach the most marginalised and vulnerable. These usually include women and children, people living with disabilities, older persons and people who can be otherwise marginalised and left out of mainstream disaster management planning.Hurricanes take a heavy toll and highlight the growing complexity of extreme weather events in areas of the world affected by climate change, poverty, deforestation, and limited institutional capacity for preventing and reducing disaster risks.Saving lives must be of the uppermost concern in the coming days. In the aftermath, the challenge as always will be to build back better and avoiding the re-creation of risk, especially in countries where economic losses will be significant.Robert Glasser is the UN Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction and head of the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction"

Boy sleeps with girl. Girl essentially never leaves said boy’s house after that, particularly after her own apartment burns down in a fire of her own making. Fast forward through near-constant chaos and a series of incidents that make clear both parties’ inability to sustain a relationship: Boy proposes to girl. Girl says yes. Boy ... disappears.Such is the flash summary of the first three seasons of “You’re the Worst,” the FXX comedy starring Chris Geere as the over-confident British author Jimmy Shive-Overly and Aya Cash as his feral, on-again, off-again love interest, Gretchen. After episode upon episode seemed to be building toward the two jaded and unlikely partners finally making it work, the Season 3 finale saw Jimmy propose marriage and then promptly disappear. Now, according to some IMDB synopses of Season 4, he’ll reappear in a trailer park with a swath of mismanaged hair across his face.In true rom-com fashion, though, it’s not the end of their story. “You’re the Worst” has been dissecting the romantic comedy genre since 2014, pulling apart its glossy edges and leaving heavily scarred tissue in its wake. Through the relationship of fast-talking Jimmy and razor sharp Gretchen ― and their reliance on perfectly bizarre friends Edgar (Desmin Borges) and Lindsay (Kether Donohue) ― the show has thrown serious discussions of depression and PTSD at its viewers, along with less serious discussions of gentrification in LA, abortion, therapy, insufferable hipster culture and parental disdain. Season 4 promises equal bits darkness and introspection, and will-they-or-won’t-they hesitation, but in a conversation with HuffPost ahead of the series’ Sept. 6 premiere, Geere made this clear ― Jimmy and Gretch will end up together.Here’s what the Cambridge-born actor had to say about the couple’s future, his own fear of failure and how his show taps into the politics of today.Can you tell me a little bit about Jimmy Shive-Overly’s decision to grow a beard for Season 4? When I met up with [showrunner] Stephen [Falk] in New York for the upfronts, which are about three months before we started filming, we went for dinner and he said, “Can you not shave?” I said, “OK, do you want like a cultivated [look]?” Because I’ve never, ever not shaved past three days before, because I knew that my hair would grow sporadically and in turn look awful. So, he said, “Don’t shave it. Don’t groom it. Don’t do anything.” Of course, a month passed and I felt like I was eating hairs from the top of my lip. It was disgusting. I was like, “This is gross. Why am I going this?”I called Stephen, and I said, “Why are we doing this again?” He said, “It’s Jimmy’s way of punishing himself for what he did to Gretchen.” He hates the whole idea of hipsters and grooming, and all these kind of very Los Angelian things, so he’s basically ... it’s a combination of him attempting to be someone else, attempting to escape from everything that’s happened with Gretchen, and also, yeah, he’s punishing himself for everything. That’s his way of doing it. But don’t fret. It does get shaved down by Episode 3. Now I have this kind of semi-trendy stubble, which is a lot better.Well, outside of his facial hair preferences, what can you tell us about where Jimmy stands in his personal life, and how he’s coping emotionally with the aftermath of the Season 3 finale? Well, in typical Jimmy style, he’s not coping emotionally, which is very true to his character and also to quite an awful lot of British people in general. They have this mentality of sweeping everything under the carpet. The majority of the first part of the season is him truly believing that despite the terrible things that he did to Gretchen, in terms of the proposal thing, he truly believes that a simple apology will be enough. Gretchen just doesn’t let him get away with that, so it’s gonna be a long fight, a long road to get them back to where they were. He slowly realizes that he has to change in order to progress, and change quite a bit.So obviously “You’re the Worst” has revolved around the will-they-or-won’t-they nature of Jimmy and Gretchen’s relationship, which is a staple rom-com plot point. What do you think sets “You’re the Worst” apart from other shows? In terms of its ability to make this back-and-forth dynamic seem real and honest, rather than fan-baity?The tagline to any romantic comedy is “will they or won’t they,” but from the very beginning of the [“You’re the Worst”] pilot, this is: “they will.” They have to. But how hard that’s gonna be! They’re perfect for each other, but they have so many obstacles to confront through the course of their relationship and their professional life, that that makes it so much more difficult. I think that Jimmy especially needs to reevaluate everything. The reason this is so different from other rom-coms is that you know they have to get back together, but the only way that they’re going to do that is that they need to appreciate that they need to change. It’s sticking with them while they navigate through all these problems.I noticed on IMDB that we’re going to be meeting a few new characters in Season 4, including Burt (Raymond J. Barry), who’s been described as aggressively independent. I think he lives in a trailer park. Is he going to be usurping Edgar’s role as Jimmy’s unlikely companion, or is this a different dynamic?It’s a very different dynamic indeed, in that Burt seriously doesn’t care about Jimmy’s past. He doesn’t ask questions as to why he disappeared, because he says it’s none of his business. So, he’s been quite an independent force, and I think without knowing it, Jimmy becomes inspired by him. Not for great reasons, but inspired that being independent is how he wants to be. So, you have this dynamic of these two people who share common interests such as watching old TV shows, or walking around the trailer park together, but both of them are escaping the truth. And [...] they’ve got to confront those things, otherwise it’s going to end so badly ― so much worse than they anticipated. You can hide, everyone hides, but only for so long. You have to go and face the music at some point.So it’s safe to say we’ll still be seeing Edgar.This season, Edgar’s so much stronger than he’s ever been and he doesn’t take any of the crap that he’s taken before, which at first, Jimmy’s oblivious to, being a narcissist. Throughout the season, we realize that that dynamic has changed as well, and Edgar kind of becomes the boss rather than Jimmy bossing him around all the time, which is great. It’s growth ― growth within friendship. Stephen Falk has mentioned in interviews that Season 4 was influenced a little bit by the “serious politics of our time,” but he made it very clear that the show won’t be mentioning Donald Trump, for example. I was wondering if you could give us a little insight into how politics has shaped the story of Season 4?I think it’s important that we haven’t mentioned anything too political. There are the odd one-liners, but I think in terms of the attitude of the characters, the story of Season 4 is basically looking deeper into how, whether we like it or not, we are a product of our parents. We are a product of our environment. As with politics, we think, “Well, this is the way it is now. We should just conform.” I think the point is that you don’t have to conform. You have a voice. You can live your life how you want to. For all four characters, there’s a point where they all reveal that their parents have made them who they are and therefore this is who they should be. But all of them, at some point, say, “Do you know what, I don’t want to be like that anymore. I don’t want to behave like my parents behave just because I was taught that.”That realization is so important. I think it’s really important for everyone, especially our age. It’s weird, they used to call it a midlife crisis, where you’re like, “I’ve got to this point in my life. I haven’t got married, or I haven’t had children, or I haven’t got a house,” and all these things. You have a point where you sit there, and go, “What have I achieved in my 35, 40 years on this earth?” You can go two ways with that: into deep depression, which a lot of people do, or anger and resentment, or you can try and do something about it. The four characters, all individually, go through these things. I think the fans are really rooting for us this year, because you know the show, in nutshell, it demonstrates how broken the world is at the moment. It’s not just these four people. It’s everyone. Yes, they do say and do awful things, but they’re broken people due to their upbringings and their surroundings and the politically chaotic world that we live in at the moment. Appreciating that everyone is broken is quite a beautiful thing, and knowing that we’re all in this mess together, rather than pretending that you’re not, or that you’re the only person who is broken within a perfect world. You’re not. The world is a crazy place at the moment. What we have to do is stick together.One of my favorite reviews of the Season 3 finale touched on these deeper themes in the show, and it made a comparison between “You’re the Worst” and “The Leftovers.” Have you seen that show?No, I haven’t. No. What was the comparison?“The Leftovers” is an incredibly deep, existential, near-apocalyptic sci-fi show that also happens to involve some love stories. But the comparison was essentially that the characters in both “You’re the Worst” and “The Leftovers” are motivated by this fear of death.I think it’s not just death. I think it’s fear of failure. Fear of failing their parents, their position in society. So, they’re confronting that fear by standing up to it and ignoring it, but sometimes that’s not the best thing. This fear of death is actually mentioned a couple of times, because rather than, “Oh I’m just so worried, it’s all going to end some day,” it’s more, “Well, you know, I might as well do the best I can right now, because it’s all going to end at any moment,” which some people can take as a positive approach.Has the show made you think about this sort of fear of failure, or fear of death, in your own life?Yeah, absolutely. I have. I think it’s made me constantly grateful. Yet, I’m filled with trepidation and excitement every single time I go to set. I think I have, of course, an anxiety about not working again, but all four of us do. We started together. One of our funny stories that we tell sometimes is that we did the table read for Episode 1 ― which, funny enough, was the only table read we’ve ever done for this show. We did a table read for Episode 1 in front of all the executive producers and people from FX, the heads of departments, all of which we didn’t know. All of us got in an Uber afterward and went to In-N-Out Burger and sat there thinking that we were going to get fired.Aya said to me, “You know what, we might do the pilot and then it just disappears, or we could be doing this for the next seven years. You never know.” Thankfully, we’re doing the latter, so far. But since the four of us had that same sort of excited energy at the beginning, that stayed throughout. These guys are friends for life now. It’s, as they say, a proper family.Do you expect a Season 5, Season 6, as much as they’ll let you do?Yes, absolutely. I think there’s just so much more to tell. I know that it’s definitely ... It can’t end this year, because the fans would be so annoyed that things haven’t been resolved. I’m hoping for 10 seasons. Why not? Because it’s a love story that I think needs to be told. I think it’s important that people know that they’re not alone in feeling lost, and yes, it’s called “You’re the Worst.” They say and do horrible things, but they’re still deserving of love. They’re still deserving of happiness. Their route to getting there is just so hard, but constantly I’m getting tweets and messages from people saying, “You and Gretchen are just like me and my girlfriend, or me and my boyfriend.” It’s not living happily ever after. It’s existing as best as you can, and trying to find some happiness in what is quite a broken world.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity. "

Heidi Heitkamp joined the president at an event in her home state.,2017-09-06,"President Donald Trump gives a thumbs up as he departs the White House to North Dakota on Sept. 6, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59b0400a1b000028005b4d62.jpeg?cache=gQArM2cHoN&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Accompanied by a Democratic senator, President Donald Trump took to the road again on Wednesday to whip up political support for tax cuts with broad promises that lower corporate taxes would buoy the fortunes of ordinary Americans.Speaking at the Tesoro oil refinery in Mandan, North Dakota, Trump reiterated his oft-made claims that the United States’ high corporate taxes are to blame for slow economic growth and stagnant working-class pay. But he revealed no new details about what he wants from Congress.The speech was the latest installment of campaign-style events aimed at passing tax reform that began with a speech in Springfield, Missouri, a week ago and will occur on a virtually weekly basis until Congress passes legislation, according to the White House.This time, however, Trump had the benefit of Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) by his side, important for the president as he tries to cajole red-state Democrats into at least entertaining his plans to revise the tax code.“I want all of America to be inspired by what’s happened in North Dakota and the North Dakota example,” Trump said. “This state is a reminder of what can happen when we promote American jobs instead of obstructing them, which has been happening, believe me.”North Dakota has a top corporate income tax rate of 4.31 percent, which is on the lower end of the 44 states that collect such taxes. Thanks to an oil and natural gas boom that has little to do with taxes, the state had an unemployment rate of 2.2 percent in July, the lowest of any state in the country.As a presidential candidate, Trump cast himself as a one-man panacea, famously promising that he “alone can fix” the country’s broken political system in his speech accepting the Republican presidential nomination.But in North Dakota on Wednesday, Trump, seemingly chastened by the defeat of efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, claimed that Congress would pass tax reform “only if you demand it.”Trump appealed to them to call members of Congress, offering a script that he suggested should have particular traction with elected Democrats.”You can remind them that both of the Reagan tax cuts were passed by a Democratic majority in the House, a Democratic Speaker, and the vast majority of Democrats in the Senate – including a Democratic senator from the great state of North Dakota,” he said. “So it can happen.”“You listening Heidi?” he added, referring to Heitkamp. “Yes, Heidi’s listening. Yeah, she heard that. Thank you Heidi.”“We’re not gonna put her on the spot! I’m not gonna put her on the spot!” Trump concluded, drawing laughs as he pointed toward her offstage.Heitkamp is up for reelection in 2018 in a state Trump won by nearly 36 percentage points in November.“If Democrats don’t want to bring back your jobs, cut your taxes, raise your pay and help America win – voters should deliver a clear message: Do your job to deliver for America, or find a new job,” he said.Heitkamp joined Trump at the event after traveling with him there from Washington, D.C., on Air Force One, appearing onstage at the beginning of Trump’s speech with fellow North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven, Gov. Doug Burgum and Lt. Gov. Brent Sanford ― all of whom are Republicans.She has not committed to supporting Trump and congressional Republicans’ tax reform legislation. In a statement about the event on Friday, Heitkamp emphasized her desire to reform a tax code that too often leaves her constituents “twisting in the wind” without laying out explicit conditions for her support.“I’ve been pushing for both sides of the aisle to work together in Congress toward permanent, comprehensive solutions that will do away with loopholes and handouts for special interests and instead promote our small businesses, farm economy and energy industries with the fiscally responsible reforms they need to grow and expand,” Heitkamp said Friday.Trump is courting Democrats in order to ensure passage of more ambitious tax reforms.The Democratic minority in the Senate has the power to filibuster permanent changes to the tax code that add to the projected budget deficit.To avoid a filibuster on the long-lasting reductions favored by movement conservatives and big business, Trump needs the votes of at least 8 members of the Senate Democratic Caucus.Trump and congressional Republicans could bypass Democrats altogether by using a process known as budget reconciliation to enact tax changes, a move that would only require a simple majority in the Senate. But budgeting rules would require that legislation to sunset after 10 years if it increases the deficit. That’s why the budget-busting income and capital gains tax cuts enacted by then-President George W. Bush in 2001 would have all expired at the end of 2010 absent legislation that extended them.It is not surprising that Trump is courting Heitkamp, a moderate up for reelection in a Republican state who has bucked her party leadership in the past. She was one of three Democrats who voted to confirm Trump nominee Neil Gorsuch as a Supreme Court justice in April.Other centrist Democratic senators up for reelection in 2018 in states that went heavily for Trump include Sens. Joe Manchin (W.Va.), Jon Tester (Mont.), Joe Donnelly (Ind.), Bill Nelson (Fla.) and Claire McCaskill (Mo.).Unlike Heitkamp, McCaskill did not join Trump at his speech promoting tax reform in her home state last Wednesday. In his remarks, Trump called McCaskill out by name, admonishing Missourians not to reelect the senator if she did not cooperate with Trump’s tax agenda. “If she doesn’t do it for you, you have to have to vote her out of office,” he said.Even as Trump tries to win over Democratic lawmakers to his cause, liberal groups are pushing in the opposite direction. Not One Penny, a coalition of left-leaning groups founded on the principle that millionaires and wealthy corporations should not get a penny more in tax cuts, announced Wednesday that it is targeting Heitkamp and other potentially shaky Democratic lawmakers with a five-figure television ad buy to discourage them from working with Trump.Trump has offered a relatively broad framework to Congress for reforming taxes. He has proposed lowering the top corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent, but is reportedly open to reducing it to between 20 and 25 percent. He would try to discourage corporations from using accounting gimmicks to stash money overseas by switching to a so-called “territorial system,” in which corporations are not taxed on profits made in foreign countries.He has also vowed to lower individual income tax rates without specifying what he would like them to be, simplify the tax system so every American can complete their tax returns on a single sheet of paper, and eliminate the estate tax on the financial assets of wealthy people after they die.The president has said he will pay for the tax cuts by closing loopholes that disproportionately benefit the wealthy and special interests.  But most experts believe this is either mathematically impossible or politically unfeasible. Ending the tax deductions that cost the Treasury the most in lost revenue, such as the mortgage interest deduction and the differential taxation of capital gains and dividends, either benefit middle-class households or a powerful constituency like large investors.Trump’s policy rationale for reducing corporate taxes has also come under scrutiny from experts. He claimed again at the event on Wednesday that the U.S. has the highest corporate tax rate in the world.In fact, while the U.S. has a high official rate, corporations use deductions and other credits to pay considerably less than that ― in many cases enjoying a lighter burden than foreign competitors. In practice, the average U.S. corporation pays a tax rate of 18.6 percent, according to the Congressional Budget Office ― lower than the average in Argentina, Japan and the United Kingdom.And it is not at all clear that there is a correlation between tax burdens and the willingness of corporations to invest in domestic growth. Between 2008 and 2016, median employment at 92 profitable U.S. corporations with tax rates under 20 percent actually declined by 1 percent, according to a report by the Institute for Policy Studies.Contrary to what Trump claims, moving to a so-called “territorial tax” system would actually encourage corporations to offshore their profits, by exempting foreign profits from U.S. taxes, according to Chuck Marr, director of federal tax policy at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank.“It is against the interest of workers in the United States,” Marr said.“The economic narrative of the campaign was that you had these working-class people who have too long been ignored,” he added. “Then when it comes time for his plan, when he’s moving around trillions of dollars around, those people are ignored. That’s a betrayal.”"

When Pkorkor’s stomach began to swell and his body shivered with periodic fevers, his father took him straight to a traditional healer who promised to find a cure.Living in Kenya’s rural Baringo region far from any clinic, Lomerilima Lokale was so hopeful the healer would make his teenage son better that he sold five goats and a camel to pay him ― a fortune for the pastoralist family. During two expensive visits, the healer used razor blades to make multiple cuts across the younger Lomerilima’s belly, filling them with ground herbs that caused stinging. But there was no improvement. “The money was gone,” said the boy’s father. “I didn’t know what to do.”His son had fallen ill with the highly fatal disease visceral leishmaniasis, also known as kala azar. Transmitted by the bite of an infected sandfly and particularly common in South Asia and East Africa, this parasitic disease causes fever, enlargement of the spleen and liver, and substantial weight loss.  Getting proper medications for it can save lives, but that’s difficult in rural areas like the one where the Lomerilima family lives.“It is almost 100 percent fatal if there is no treatment,” said Mark Riongoita, a clinical officer at the Kacheliba Hospital in West Pokot who specializes in kala azar. “In this region, it affects the poorest and most remote. They are far away from communication and health workers so they don’t know what is wrong. Getting to the treatment facilities is a big challenge,” he added.But unlike some sufferers in rural areas who go undiagnosed and die without treatment, Pkorkor was one of the lucky ones. “I travelled more than 105 miles over seven hours from the hospital to Baringo,” said Isaac Nyeris, a community mobilizer who rides his motorbike into hard-to-reach areas, armed with kits he can use to test for kala azar. “When the boy tested positive, I called the hospital and they sent a vehicle.” Visceral leishmaniasis is so common in Kenya’s Pokot and Baringo regions that locals have their own word for it. “Termes,” as the disease is known in Pokot’s local language, conjures images for English speakers of the pointy termite hills that dot the dusty landscape and are a preferred dwelling place of the sandflies that transmit the disease. But despite the disease’s prevalence, Kacheliba Hospital hosts one of the only wards specializing kala azar treatment in western Kenya, which according to Riongoita treats up to 20 afflicted people a month. Patients like Pkorkor stay in the basic ward for several weeks and endure intense daily injections of a combination of sodium stibogluconate and paromomycin. Most patients who receive treatment recover and are able to go home.“Before, many people lost their lives,” said Nyeris, whose own uncle died of the disease. “But today it is rare to lose a patient to kala azar unless we don’t have blood in the hospital.” While the drugs used to beat kala azar have improved ― in Kacheliba, the treatment time has gone down from 30 days to 17 after a move to combination therapy ― countries like Kenya still rely on a potentially unstable external supply.Across the country, public health facilities aren’t easily available, and some of the drugs used for treatment aren’t registered in Kenya. The Geneva-based nonprofit Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi), which carried out the studies that successfully reduced the standard treatment time, is helping to provide medicine to the clinic, Riongoita said.DNDi is now focused on developing an oral alternative for kala azar patients that can replace the painful injections used in the current treatment process.“What the patients need is an oral treatment ― so that you can say, ‘Go take this two times a day at home for two weeks and then come back’ ― that is the ultimate goal for us in DNDi,” said Dr. Monique Wasunna, the organization’s Africa director. Leishmaniasis manifests in several syndromes ― Kenya is also suffering from an outbreak of the non-fatal cutaneous form in another part of the country. But throughout the country, outbreak locations share the same problems around remoteness and access to medical care, meaning that the true prevalence of the disease is hard to gauge.It is estimated that ― globally ― there are up to 400,000 new cases each year, but that only 30 percent of cases are reported, according to the DNDi.Nyeris and his bike do help bring accurate diagnoses to remote communities, but kala azar is often misidentified, and many, like Pkorkor and his father, still turn to traditional healers. “Many people don’t understand the causes of this disease. They think it is malaria,” said Nyeris. “I use this motorbike to go into the interior to create awareness of the disease and tell people where they can get treated.”While, the medication has some toxicity in certain cases, especially when mistakes are made around the dose, fear surrounding stories of others dying in the hospital also keeps potential patients away.“People in the village say that if you go to the hospital and have injections, then you will die, so they prefer to go to traditional healers,” said Riongoita, the clinical officer. “They don’t get well [with the healers] but during the delay in coming to the hospital they have already developed complications.”Lotoyok Shang’ale, an assistant chief living near Kacheliba, has become an advocate for clinical treatment in his community, encouraging members with symptoms of kala azar to go straight to hospital.Shang’ale survived the disease himself and was successfully treated at Kacheliba Hospital, but only after enduring an excruciating traditional treatment in his home. “They brought a woman who was said to be an expert in kala azar ― she told me that she would burn her medicine on top of my stomach and I would be healed,” Shang’ale recalled. “After 30 minutes, the powder she put there was burning like fire. I told her it was too hot and she told me to hold on, but I could not. I ran away and jumped into the river to cool myself.” “The traditional medicine is too painful… It leaves you even more sick,” he added. “We have told many people that treatment is available and that they should go to the hospital.” Pkoror, still walking gingerly despite the many injections, began the long journey home by mounting the back of the bike that had helped bring him to the hospital.While sufferers who reach the hospital generally leave cured, it’s an unpleasant experience and if a breadwinner either falls ill or has to accompany a child, already poor families are usually hit hard financially.So it’s no surprise that, perched between Nyeris and his father, Pkorkor smiled as the bike meandered out of the hospital’s sandy yard toward Kacheliba’s main bus stop. “I haven’t been able to play for a long time because of the illness and then the pain of the injections,” he said. “I’m looking forward to getting home and running around with my friends again.”DNDi is a recipient of grants from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which also funds HuffPost’s Project Zero series.

Sept. 1.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59ac07961400002000fa7c97.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"VENICE — Directed by Chinese artist and activist Ai Weiwei, “Human Flow” ― a documentary filmed in 23 different countries ― depicts the largest human displacement since World War II. Behind the refugee crisis, we see a crisis of humanity. Ai’s message is that if tolerance and compassion continue to give way to isolationism and xenophobia, “humanity will face an even bigger crisis,” as he puts it. The WorldPost interviewed Ai at the “Human Flow” premiere at the 74th International Venice Film Festival in Italy, which for the past several years has been an entry point to Europe for hundreds of thousands of migrants and refugees streaming across the Mediterranean Sea from North Africa.WORLDPOST: There was a striking scene in the film where you were walking with a young boy on a beach. Why did you choose to include that?AI WEIWEI: In the scene, I was on vacation in Lesbos with my girlfriend and son. He and I were walking on the beach. The beach is the most attractive thing to any child. It’s just vast and blue and has this kind of wildness. Suddenly, a boat approached. Then we see the whole image of the beach change. People started jumping down off the boat. We saw a lot of children, a lot of women.WORLDPOST: Your son saw this?AI WEIWEI:Yeah, he saw it. WORLDPOST: And did he understand?AI WEIWEI:No, he couldn’t.WORLDPOST:Did you try to explain?AI WEIWEI:I couldn’t explain. I had become speechless. I was just never prepared for something like this. You become like a machine, and speech suddenly doesn’t work. I automatically put on my headphones to shoot the images, but I [was] feeling so badly because you don’t know how to help them. I saw people wet, falling down, and nobody was helping them.It made me wonder what is in their hearts. Why did they give up everything? They don’t speak the same language [and don’t practice] the same religion. And they’re treated as if they’re not human. So I thought, “Oh my god. This is something I’ve never experienced. I would like to know more about it.” And I said, “I have to set up a studio here and just watch this, just record this.” That was how I made my decision to make this film.WORLDPOST:The film documents the crossing of borders and mixing of nationalities. Going forward, do you think identity is going to become less national and more global?AI WEIWEI:Civilization has evolved toward more acceptance, understanding and tolerance of global thinking. If we accept differences, our creativity booms. It makes life much more colorful. It also makes humanity much more safe. If we see pureness somewhere as something to be desired, the trouble starts.WORLDPOST: Do you consider yourself more of a Chinese citizen or a global citizen of Chinese descent?AI WEIWEI:I never felt like a Chinese citizen because I was pushed away at a very young age. My father, a writer, was a national enemy of the Communist Party. He was forbidden to write for 20 years. We literally lived underground. We dug a hole and lived there for years. My father cleaned public toilets, even though he was a highly respected poet. Nationality and borders are barriers to our intelligence, to our imagination and to all kinds of possibilities.WORDPOST: Are you saying nationality should go away or become more global?AI WEIWEI:Nationality started as something natural, but we should not be restrained by the old politics that make up these clear lines. It should have its own way of evolving. In some places, it will evolve slower and in others, faster. It’s like the mountains, the ocean and the rivers. It has its own geological forms. Societies cannot be flat. But during change, human rights, human dignity and free speech have to be protected. Otherwise, we’ll be going backward. WORLDPOST:In the past, much of your artwork has focused on China ― from the Han Dynasty to Tiananmen Square to the Sichuan earthquake. Now, it seems you are more globally focused. How did this transition happen?AI WEIWEI:I think I’m just a traveler. When you walk across a river and there’s no bridge, you build one. I’m used to having to deal with Chinese Communist ideology ― it’s not really an ideology, but a method of control. But China’s problems are not just China’s problems ― they’re human problems. Humanity has always worked better when you see it as one.Now I’ve come to such a mixed culture: America, Europe, South America, Africa. And the politics are changing everywhere all the time and becoming even more unpredictable. There’s no such thing as “fixed” culture. China is also becoming more global. Its problems are becoming international problems, becoming German problems, becoming American problems. Nothing is clear-cut. Perhaps I’ll find my way ― or get totally lost.WORLDPOST: You are putting up an exhibition throughout New York City called “Good Fences Make Good Neighbors.” What is the idea behind it?AI WEIWEI:The United States is a melting pot. Like John F. Kennedy said, it’s a nation of immigrants. But [Donald] Trump wants to build a fence that clearly makes the statement: “You and I are divided. We’re different, and you’re dangerous.” That kind of thinking stops human, civilized evolution. It’s dangerous to create that kind of tension. WORLDPOST: There’s a scene in “Human Flow” where an Israeli said that because a wall keeps Palestinians and Israelis physically apart, children grow up thinking of the people on the other side only in terms of stereotypes. They never actually meet each other, and that’s precarious.AI WEIWEI:Right. It builds this sense of enemies and monsters. WORLDPOST: Are you going to try to plan screenings for legislators involved in refugee policy?AI WEIWEI:Yes, yes, of course. That’s what we want.WORLDPOST:Throughout the film, there were scenes with you in front of the screen, interacting with refugees. Your cameramen and other crew members were also on screen at times. It was as if the making of the movie was a part of the movie. Was that intentional?AI WEIWEI:My art is a personal effort to help viewers understand, through experiences and emotions, another person or another condition. Some kind of introduction of that individual interaction on screen is an important element of the film. I went in with very limited knowledge of the complex refugee situation. I think it’s a more honest way to present a situation. It’s sometimes humorous and awkward but it’s honest. Making this film was such a struggle. There are language barriers, geographical barriers, local politics and the dangers of war zones. Everything happens in such a short period of time. So you have to have some kind of vision, to know how to catch what you later can use. But even still, you’re not writing the script ― the script is writing you.WORLDPOST: Much of the footage I’ve seen of the refugee crisis has been dramatic ― with people who are soaked, wailing, burned or emaciated, sometimes with dead bodies. But your film, especially the first half, showed people going about their daily life in refugee camps ― cooking their food, talking on their cell phones, playing games. Explain that approach.AI WEIWEI:Yes. That’s purposely set up for the tone. When you’re making a film, you need a film language. We tried to avoid simple emotional and dramatic scenes. Ordinary life is dramatic enough. We can easily understand the difficulties of ordinary people surviving. We don’t want to only rely on images that shock people or make people feel that the situation is so hopeless. We want people to feel that the situation is normal, just like daily life ― but when you think about it, it’s not acceptable. There is no human dignity in the [refugee] camps.WORLDPOST: What’s your response to the argument that if we welcome refugees and make the passage safe, then the flood of refugees will become even more overwhelming?AI WEIWEI:That could be true, or it could not be true. You have to have trust in humanity. I have experienced people who live on a mountain, where there isn’t even any water, and they have to climb down the mountain to pick up water. People always ask why they have to do that: why can’t they just move down the mountain? It’s because they belong to the mountain.Those refugees don’t belong to Europe. I’ve never met a refugee who doesn’t want to go home. They are being forced out. It would be their last choice to stay somewhere so foreign.I’ve seen people who escape North Korea and cannot accept the Western lifestyle. Don’t take the Western lifestyle as the natural, absolute condition. It’s just an illusion. Humans have their own dignity to develop. We have to trust that."

There is no human dignity in the [refugee] camps.WORLDPOST: What’s your response to the argument that if we welcome refugees and make the passage safe, then the flood of refugees will become even more overwhelming?AI WEIWEI:That could be true, or it could not be true. You have to have trust in humanity. I have experienced people who live on a mountain, where there isn’t even any water, and they have to climb down the mountain to pick up water. People always ask why they have to do that: why can’t they just move down the mountain? It’s because they belong to the mountain.Those refugees don’t belong to Europe. I’ve never met a refugee who doesn’t want to go home. They are being forced out. It would be their last choice to stay somewhere so foreign.I’ve seen people who escape North Korea and cannot accept the Western lifestyle. Don’t take the Western lifestyle as the natural, absolute condition. It’s just an illusion. Humans have their own dignity to develop. We have to trust that."

To gain the ability to work legally under the new program despite being undocumented, Pérez had to make the tough choice to give the Department of Homeland Security not just her own address, but the one for her mom and dad as well. “That always weighs heavily on my mind,” Pérez said. “My biggest concern right now is my parents because DHS has my information… I’m not so much worried for myself as for my family.” After the Trump administration announced the termination of DACA on Tuesday, several of the program’s recipients interviewed by HuffPost described feeling a sense of both injustice and betrayal. The program, whose full title is Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, shielded undocumented immigrants who came to the country as minors from deportation and allowed them to work legally in the United States. To take advantage of the program, DACA recipients had to make a leap of faith that the federal government would not turn around after Barack Obama’s presidency ended and use their own information against them.  Many of them, like Pérez, were living with undocumented family members when they provided their address to USCIS on their first applications. As the Trump administration eviscerates the last major immigration reform of the Obama years, many DACA beneficiaries were not worried so much about themselves as their parents or other family members left out of the program and in limbo by stalled attempts to pass farther-reaching reforms through Congress. “I’m freaked out,” Pérez said. “But at the same time, there’s this renewed commitment to fight for everyone in the immigrant community, including my parents.” Juan Belman, 24, obtained DACA while studying at the University of Texas at Austin. He has graduated, but continues to organize with the University Leadership Initiative, a student group at the school. The address Belman submitted with his DACA application was his family home, where his undocumented parents live. “That’s a concern,” Belman told HuffPost. “I’m not always home. That’s something I worry about. We’ve given them all our information.”  Another DACA recipient, who asked to be identified only as Luis in order to protect his family, remembered feeling ecstatic back in 2012 when the Obama administration rolled out DACA. Having fled years ago as an unaccompanied minor from gang violence and an abusive father in Central America, Luis had no way to apply to normalize his status before DACA.“Many of us ran from persecution, from violence, from absolute levels of poverty,” Luis said. “All of the sudden, a Dreamer is told that there is going to be a line. Of course you’re going to jump on line!” “Of course I trusted it,” he continued. “Because I believe in this nation and I want to serve this nation, regardless of its politics and its different administrations.” Now enrolled in graduate school, he worries about what the Trump administration’s decision to kill the program will mean for his ability to work here, or the impact it will have on more mundane but life-changing opportunities the program granted him, like the ability to obtain a driver’s license. (A spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Public Security wrote in an email that DACA recipients’ licenses would expire along with their participation in the program.) But more than that, he’s concerned about the impact the decision will have on his mother. “I wonder what my mom is thinking,” Luis said. “I talk to her and she’s crying… I am in college and so is my mom every single day I’m in class because I have her in my heart. My family trusted. And now the entire nation has been betrayed.”  Homeland Security officials insist that they will not use the information provided by DACA recipients against them to pursue deportation orders. Those who participated in the program gave their information to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency that processes applications to obtain legal residency or to obtain American citizenship. That agency is separate from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which carries out deportation policy. But both agencies belong to DHS, leading to unease among the program’s recipients that their trust of federal authorities may backfire on them. Ahead of Tuesday’s announcement that the Trump administration would end DACA, Homeland Security officials told reporters that USCIS will not share information with ICE, unless they had a compelling reason. “In instances of criminality or law enforcement, we will use all of our law enforcement databases,” one of the department’s senior officials said. A statement posted on the DHS website noted that the information-sharing policy between the department’s agencies could change without warning.  “This policy, which may be modified, superseded, or rescinded at any time without notice, is not intended to, does not, and may not be relied upon to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable by law by any party in any administrative, civil, or criminal matter,” the statement reads. The vagueness of those assertions offers little assurance to the individuals concerned about what Tuesday’s changes mean for themselves or their families. At the same time, concerns about information sharing through the soon-to-be-defunct DACA program is unlikely to keep many of the program’s beneficiaries quiet.  Even before the Obama administration implemented DACA, many undocumented youths had begun openly declaring their immigration status as a political act, adopting the slogan “undocumented and unafraid.” One of them, Cesar Vargas, became the first undocumented immigrant in the state of New York to obtain a license to practice law in 2015 ― a state court decision based partly on the fact that he had DACA.These days, he practices immigration law in Staten Island. Despite concerns about information sharing between USCIS and ICE, Vargas emphasized that until it’s phased out, the program continues. “I’m telling clients, ‘your information should be safe,’” he said. “But don’t get in trouble. That’s where we’re at right now.”While his hard-fought ability to practice law was plunged into doubt with the Trump administration’s decision, Vargas urged other Dreamers to keep publicly pushing for reform, noting like most others interviewed for this story that it was their efforts that led to the creation of DACA in the first place. “One of the things we try to tell people is that this is a moment not to regress back to the shadows,” Vargas said. “This is a moment where we’re undocumented and unafraid. Trump and [Attorney General] Jeff Sessions want us to regress back to the shadows. They tell stories that portray us as criminals and rapists. But we need to keep telling our own stories.”Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

22,THE WORLDPOST,"With Revolutionary Battery Tech, We Can Shift Global Energy To Renewables, Says Bill Joy","Nathan Gardels, ContributorEditor-in-chief, The WorldPost",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-battery-technology_us_59aea591e4b0dfaafcf28e20,"Inventor and investor Bill Joy describes a breakthrough
technology that can speed the de-carbonization of the planet.",2017-09-06,"This collapsable electric vehicle uses batteries instead of combustion engines. Daejeon, South Korea, Sept. 2, 2013.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59af6b921b000028005b4b9a.jpeg?cache=sE0FegaKEc&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Bill Joy was a cofounder of Sun Microsystems, famous for his essay in Wired magazine in 2000, “Why The Future Doesn’t Need Us.” An investor and inventor, he is a board member at Ionic Materials, which recently announced a major breakthrough in creating solid-state rechargeable batteries. He spoke this week with The WorldPost’s editor-in-chief Nathan Gardels.When so many investors and inventors up in Silicon Valley are focused on social media innovations, hoping to be the new Facebook or Snapchat, what led you, who comes from that world, to turn toward batteries instead?We are not about creating “wants,” but about meeting needs. As monster floods and blistering droughts afflict the planet, what could be more important than hugely accelerating the cost reductions and storage capacity necessary to decisively shift the trajectory to renewables? Time is an ethical dimension. And we have no time to waste.As the world moves more and more toward energy generation from renewables, challenging the dominance of fossil fuels, the roadblock to a low-carbon future has always been how to store all that energy so it is available when needed. The “holy grail” thus has to be inexpensive, reliable and long-lasting batteries. With your recent breakthrough, have we grasped the grail?I would say yes. It has long been a goal of the battery industry to improve batteries by making them without liquids, replacing the liquid electrolyte in a battery with a solid. Ionic Materials has invented the first practical solid electrolyte that works at room temperature, an inexpensive and easy-to-work-with polymer that makes many kinds of solid-state batteries possible. The polymer can be used to improve lithium-ion batteries, making them safer by replacing their flammable liquid electrolyte with a crystalline polymer material that does not burn. Rather than exploding when punctured — as current lithium-ion batteries sometimes do — batteries made with this new polymer can survive multiple bullet impacts and not only not explode, but still work.But what is more surprising and unexpected is that the polymer can be used to make rechargeable alkaline batteries. We are all familiar with alkaline single-use non-rechargeable AA and AAA cells, which are cheap to make — far cheaper than lithium-ion. Using the polymer not only makes them fully rechargeable but also interacts with the active ingredients in an advanced way that allows the amount of material used to be substantially reduced, and also allows us to use aluminum rather than zinc in these batteries, further reducing their cost, volume and weight.Such dirt-cheap, high-performance and safe batteries made from abundant inexpensive materials like zinc or aluminum meet and, with aluminum, exceed the specs of today’s lithium-ion. And yet, they cost only a fraction of what today’s lithium-ion batteries do, since the latter are made with rarer, more expensive and dangerous materials. Because of their incredibly low cost and the abundant materials that can be used to make them, we can imagine, in the not-too-distant future, aluminum alkaline batteries as the main kind of battery that will be used in the world.What are the immediate practical implications, both for use and for cost?Consumer electronics today use the most advanced lithium-ion batteries. Because they use rare materials such as cobalt, mined mostly in the Congo, the highest capacity of these batteries have active material costs as high as $125 per kilowatt per hour. The new solid polymer uses less and even none of the most expensive ingredient, cobalt, thus improving lithium-ion battery performance for demanding personal mobile electronics applications, while reducing cost and increasing safety.For transportation, the polymer should support reducing active material costs for lithium-ion below $50 per kilowatt per hour. Costs for battery packs for electric vehicles can drop well below $100 per kilowatt per hour. The polymer also allows us to build, for the first time, practical rechargeable lithium-sulfur batteries, which are extremely lightweight. Lithium-sulfur has long been the ideal chemistry to use in airborne applications, and these are not only lightweight, but also safe, solving the safety issue which dogged the industry. Remember, for example, the battery fires on the Boeing Dreamliner.Above all, if we are going to de-carbonize the energy grid and accelerate and expand the electrification of cars and trucks, we need much cheaper batteries. The advance to alkaline rechargeables makes that possible — we can imagine active material costs for such batteries well below $10, and with aluminum as low as $6 per kilowatt per hour.Radically low-cost alkaline battery packs should allow even the cheapest cars to be made even cheaper, if made with batteries instead of conventional combustion engines. The implications of low-cost rechargeable alkaline batteries for the electric grid are even more profound. Large format batteries designed especially for use with renewables on the grid will optimize lifetime, cost and performance, allowing us to reasonably hope to store and retrieve a kilowatt-hour of energy for a cost of less than one cent.This should allow us to make renewables “fully dispatchable,” using the batteries to cover for interruptions from clouds blocking the solar power of the sun and from the variability of the wind.We also imagine putting energy storage in many places on the grid and moving energy from place to place at night, for example, when the grid lines are otherwise unused. This will create an energy network where energy can be bought and sold and distributed closer to where it will be needed later.Being able to move stored energy around can revolutionize the grid in the same way that packet switching of data led to the amazing advances of the internet. It should create a market where low-cost renewables, solar and wind, can meet all our power needs.In less developed areas of the world, where there is an unreliable grid or no grid at all, cheap alkaline rechargeable batteries can support sustainable electrification with solar and wind power. With access locked securely to your cell phone to protect against theft, a kilowatt-hour battery for your house or two-wheeler might cost as little as $10, and local recharging businesses can flourish. In short, the advance to all solid batteries thus promises to greatly decarbonize the world.What is the time to market of this new invention? What are the remaining roadblocks?The first batteries using the polymer should be in high-volume production in two to three years. As with all new technologies, it will take time to scale up production. It is possible to get many of the benefits of the polymer by retrofitting existing manufacturing facilities, but to gain all advantages and get the full cost down will require investing in newer, simpler manufacturing — heretofore not possible — to take full advantage of the simplicity of polymer-based manufacturing.How does your breakthrough compare with what they are doing in China, which is also focusing on the holy grail of energy storage?In China, with very high-volume manufacturing and low cost of capital and subsidies, the cost of making lithium-ion batteries has declined substantially. We see that trend continuing, and the polymer can be used to address the fire hazard issue, which dogs such batteries. But even with radical and continuing cost reductions, we don’t believe that the costs of lithium-ion will ever be as low as the alkaline rechargeables — these are truly unexpected, with off-the-charts low-cost materials and very cheap manufacturing.A final question: The race is on to keep global temperatures from rising above 2 degrees Celsius. That is the declared goal of the Paris climate accord. Though the U.S. has withdrawn, most countries — as well as states like California — have developed plans to try to meet that goal. If these batteries are as cheap and reliable as you say, will the market have a better chance of bringing about a low-carbon future than governments? We are in a desperate race against time; we need both the profit motive and government support for rapid decarbonization.Really cheap batteries will help make electric cars much cheaper, and we can hope businesses will push them out quickly, but public policy to convert the fleet to full electric more quickly would still greatly help. For example: a large-scale program to retire older polluting gas and diesel cars and replace them with electric, a larger version of what we saw in the “cash for clunkers” program which was implemented in the U.S. after the 2008 market crash.And cheap batteries should make renewables vastly more interesting as a source of energy on the grid, but as utilities are so heavily regulated we will need policy support to make the change quickly. To hold the line at 2 degrees Celsius, I think we will need to accelerate the retirement of fossil fuel-based generating plants, and turn off coal and even natural gas plants before the end of their normal lifetimes; this process will hopefully be accelerated by a suitable government-supported early-retirement program."

Wong,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chicago-library-this-day-in-june_us_59b00fd8e4b0b5e53102c446,"A parent argued ""the library is not providing a safe place for children to explore children’s books.”",2017-09-06,"Written by Gayle E.

Written by Gayle E. Pitman, This Day in June is billed as a “wildly whimsical, validating and exuberant reflection” of the LGBTQ community. The 2014 book, which features full-color illustrations by Kristyna Litten, depicts a Pride celebration for young readers, while a parent’s guide includes a glossary of terms as well as age-appropriate suggestions about how to discuss sexual orientation and gender identity with children.But when their 3-year-old daughter discovered the book on the shelves of the West Chicago Public Library, Kurt and Michaela Jaros filed a complaint and asked the library board if the book could be moved out of the children’s section.“At the very least, this book should be moved to the parental section. I don’t think we see other children’s books showing these sorts of images,” Kurt Jaros, who felt This Day in June was “ultimately about sexuality,” told The Chicago Tribune. His wife, he added, “feels like the library is not providing a safe place for children to explore children’s books.”Kurt Jaros is the executive director of Defenders Media, an alliance of evangelistic ministries that offers “a defense of the Christian worldview.” He also serves as the host of “Veracity Hill,” a conservative Christian podcast.Given Jaros’ stature, it’s no surprise his efforts caught the attention of the Illinois Family Institute, which urged locals to attend an Aug. 28 library board meeting where his complaint would be addressed.“Some argue that having this and similar books removed from library shelves is ‘censorship’ or ‘book burning.’ As with everything else, Leftists can’t quite grasp the fact that taxpayer[s] have a say in how their tax dollars are spent,” John Biver of the Illinois Family Institute wrote in an Aug. 25 blog. Unfortunately for the Jaros family, the vast majority of the more than 150 residents who attended the library board meeting supported keeping This Day in June in the children’s section. In the end, the board denied the request to have the book moved to the adult section 6 to 1, The Chicago Tribune reported.Pitman, who is also a professor of psychology and women’s studies at California’s Sacramento City College, told HuffPost that seeing photos of the crowd gathered at the West Chicago Public Library “seriously made me cry.”“There’s so much going on in the world right now, and a challenge to a picture book is just the tip of the iceberg,” she said. “I can’t put into words how powerful it was to see a roomful of people I’d never met before take time out of their busy lives and stand up in defense of my book. I’m grateful to every one of them.”Describing This Day in June as “an honest and unapologetic depiction of a Pride celebration,” Pittman added that the push to have her book removed was indicative of parents who instill homophobia and bigotry in their impressionable young children. Young readers view Litten’s illustrations of LGBTQ Pride revelers “as adults wearing costumes or playing dress-up ― that’s their childlike view of the world,” Pitman said. “If, however, adults freak out when they see that page, children see that, and they’re more likely to learn intolerance from that behavior than from the book itself.” West Chicago Public Library Director Benjamin Weseloh defended the board’s decision in an Aug. 29 Facebook post. “It is impossible to please everyone with everything that is added to the collection,” he wrote. “But it is the very diversity of the collection that makes it strong ― providing viewpoints from which to look at subjects through different ‘lenses’ allowing the readers to form opinions and make informed decisions.”Illinois Family Institute officials, however, were incensed, arguing that they were “disappointed in the absence of local community support” for their efforts in the end. “Those who seek to normalize disordered sexuality are far more passionate, tenacious, and bold than are those who oppose the normalization of sexual deviance,” Thomas Madison of the Illinois Family Institute wrote in an Aug. 30 blog on the group’s official website. “Unfortunately, numerous libraries throughout the country and in Illinois are using public monies to promote the normalization of homosexuality and the ‘trans’ ideology. The battle against dissenting views — including Judeo-Christian views — continues.”Catch the latest in LGBTQ culture by subscribing to the Queer Voices newsletter. "

The forcing of women and girls to act as suicide bombers has driven the sharp rise in deaths in northeast Nigeria and northern Cameroon, said Amnesty.“Boko Haram is once again committing war crimes on a huge scale, exemplified by the depravity of forcing young girls to carry explosives with the sole intention of killing as many people as they possibly can,” said Alioune Tine, Amnesty’s director for West and Central Africa.In Nigeria, the deadliest attack was in July, when the militants abducted an oil exploration team with staff of the state oil firm and a university while they were traveling in a military convoy. Boko Haram killed 40 people and kidnapped three others, Amnesty said.Boko Haram suicide bombers have killed 81 people in Nigeria since the start of April, said Amnesty.In Cameroon, the Islamist insurgency has killed at least 158 people in the same period. That is also linked to a rise in suicide bombings, the deadliest of which killed 16 people in Waza in July, the rights group said.More than 2.5 million people have been displaced or become refugees in the Lake Chad region - which includes Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger and Chad - while 7.2 million people lack secure access to food because of the conflict with Boko Haram, according to the United Nations.The insurgency has left more than 20,000 people dead since it began in 2009."

If the international conscience is awakened, that would put pressure on Myanmar.”Malaysia, another ASEAN member, summoned Myanmar’s ambassador to express displeasure over the violence and scolded Myanmar for making “little, if any” progress on the problem.“Malaysia believes that the matter of sustained violence and discrimination against the Rohingyas should be elevated to a higher international forum,” Malaysian Foreign Minister Anifah Aman said in a statement.Turkey’s President Tayyip Erdogan, who has said the violence against Rohingya Muslims constituted genocide, told Suu Kyi the violence was of deep concern to the Muslim world, and he was sending his foreign minister to Bangladesh.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi begins a visit to Myanmar on Tuesday, during which he will meet top officials, including Suu Kyi.Pakistan, home to a large Rohingya community, has expressed “deep anguish.”FULL CAMPThe latest estimate of the numbers who have crossed into Bangladesh since Aug. 25, based on calculations by U.N. workers, is 123,600.That takes to about 210,000 the number of Rohingya who have sought refuge in Bangladesh since October, when Rohingya insurgents staged smaller attacks on security posts, triggering a major Myanmar army counteroffensive and sending about 87,000 people fleeing into Bangladesh.Refugees arriving in Shamlapur, and residents of the village, said hundreds of boats had arrived on Monday and Tuesday with several thousand people.Reuters reporters saw men, women, children and a few possessions, including chickens, disembark from one boat.“The army set fire to houses,” said Salim Ullah, 28, a farmer from Myanmar’s village of Kyauk Pan Du, gripping a sack of belongings.“We got on the boat at daybreak. I came with my mother, wife and two children. There were 40 people on the boat, including 25 women.”The new arrivals - many sick or wounded - have strained the resources of aid agencies and communities already helping hundreds of thousands of refugees from previous spasms of violence in Myanmar.Vivian Tan, a spokeswoman for the U.N. refugee agency, UNHCR, said one camp in Bangladesh, Kutupalong, had reached “full capacity” and resources at others were being stretched.“We are doing what we can, but will need to seek more resources,” Tan said.Bangladesh is concerned about Myanmar army activity on the border and would lodge a complaint if Bangladeshi territory was violated, an interior ministry official said.A Bangladesh border guard officer said two blasts were heard on Tuesday on the Myanmar side, after two on Monday fueled speculation Myanmar forces had laid land mines.One boy had his left leg blown off near a border crossing before being brought to Bangladesh for treatment, while another boy suffered minor injuries, the officer, Manzurul Hassan Khan, said, adding the blast could have been a mine explosion.The Myanmar army has not commented on the blasts near the border but said in a statement on Tuesday Rohingya insurgents were planning bomb attacks in Myanmar cities including the capital, Naypyitaw, Yangon and Mandalay to “attract more attention from the world.” (Reporting by Simon Lewis and Nurul Islam in COX’S BAZAR, Wa Lone and Shoon Naing; in YANGON and Ruma Paul in DHAKA; Writing by Antoni Slodkowski; Editing by Robert Birsel and Clarence Fernandez)"

They have long been victims of state-sponsored discrimination ― including what the U.N. has deemed possible crimes against humanity.Rohingya militants attacked government security posts on Aug. 25, triggering renewed violence and a brutal retaliation by government forces that has prompted this latest exodus. In addition to those who have fled the country, tens of thousands of Rohingya are internally displaced.Security officials have reportedly carried out gruesome violence, including killings, rapes and arson, against the Rohingya community in recent days.“The brutality is unthinkable,” Matthew Smith, CEO of the advocacy group Fortify Rights, told NPR from the Bangladesh-Myanmar border. “[Myanmar’s security forces] are killing children. They’re killing women. They’re killing the elderly. They’re killing able-bodied men and boys. It’s indiscriminate.”But Suu Kyi, a former political prisoner and activist during Myanmar’s decades-long military dictatorship, has said little in the face of mounting international pressure to address the unfolding violence. Her inaction has even stirred discussion of revoking the Nobel Peace Prize she won in 1991 for “her non-violent struggle for democracy and human rights.” In a Facebook post on Tuesday, Suu Kyi finally addressed the crisis, saying that “a huge iceberg of misinformation” has been “calculated to create a lot of problems between different communities and with the aim of promoting the interest of the terrorists.”Myanmar’s government “has already started defending all the people in Rakhine in the best way possible,” the post continued.Tirana Hassan, Amnesty International’s crisis response director, was appalled by this response to the crisis.“This is a human rights and humanitarian catastrophe. In her first comments on the crisis, instead of promising concrete action to protect the people in Rakhine state, Aung San Suu Kyi appears to be downplaying the horrific reports coming out of the area,” Hassan said. Suu Kyi’s latest comments are reminiscent of a rare interview with the BBC in April, when she denied that ethnic cleansing was taking place in Rakhine state, calling it “too strong a term.”Suu Kyi declared that she wanted to run for president in Myanmar’s 2015 election, but the country’s constitution barred her from doing so because she had married a foreigner and had foreign children. The role of state counselor, which is similar to prime minister, was instead established for her in 2016.Calls for Suu Kyi to take action have come from concerned parties around the world, including 20-year-old activist Malala Yousafzai.“I am still waiting for my fellow Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi” to condemn the “tragic and shameful treatment” of Myanmar’s Rohingya Muslims, Yousafzai wrote on Twitter. “The world is waiting and the Rohingya Muslims are waiting.”Yanghee Lee, the U.N.’s special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, called the situation in Rakhine “really grave,” and said it was time for Suu Kyi to “step in.”As the crisis worsens, Myanmar’s government has tightened restrictions on desperately needed aid supplies and services in Rakhine state. “The Muslims are starving in their homes. Markets are closed and people can’t leave their villages, except to flee. There is widespread intimidation by the authorities, who are clearly using food and water as a weapon,” a humanitarian official told Amnesty International.As state counselor, Suu Kyi does not have authority over the security forces committing the alleged and documented atrocities against Rohingya Muslims, but there are still many ways she could help to ameliorate the situation, according to Hassan. “Aung San Suu Kyi is the civilian arm of the government. She can immediately do the right thing. She can allow the U.N. Fact-Finding Mission in, for example, instead of not cooperating with the Mission,” Hassan told HuffPost from Bangladesh, referring to the U.N.’s blocked efforts to conduct an independent international inquiry into the violence in Rakhine state.Hassan, who visited the Bangladesh-Myanmar border on Tuesday before speaking with HuffPost, described it as “a sea of misery.”The government must commit to addressing the root causes of the conflict, including minorities’ citizenship and rights, Hassan said.“Thus far, we have seen absolutely no attempt to do that, and it’s incredibly disappointing,” she noted. “The restrictions on humanitarian aid, the stopping of food aid and the inability to provide shelter services is the perfect storm for a humanitarian disaster.”Tejshree Thapa, the senior South Asia researcher for Human Rights Watch, last visited the Bangladesh-Myanmar border during the Muslim holiday of Eid.“It’s a very important day for Muslims. All of these people I saw coming across [the border] were Muslims, and I remember feeling particularly heartbroken, because it’s supposed to be a celebratory day for them,” Thapa told HuffPost from Bangladesh. “It’s family after family after family,” she added. “They’re desperate ― they’ve walked four or five or six days over mountain passes, after facing attacks on their villages and sheer terror.”But for many refugees arriving in Bangladesh, the living conditions are still abysmal. “There’s no shelter for them. There’s nothing,” said Thapa. “They’re literally sitting by roadsides, hillsides and under trees and bushes. They have nothing. I mean, absolutely nothing.”She believes Suu Kyi “has chosen to take the side of the majoritarian population” in Myanmar, which has an overwhelmingly Buddhist population. State media outlets in the country have been especially disparaging of Rohingya Muslims, reportedly referring to them as “morally bad” and “human fleas.”“It’s very disappointing. I wish [Suu Kyi] would recognize that she is leader of everyone in the country, not just the majority,” said Thapa. “It’s time for her to show leadership and to call on security forces to stop these egregious violations, but she’s not showing any inclination to do so.”But the crisis can be addressed, Hassan asserts. “There are solutions to these problems ― it takes the sort of moral courage and commitment to human rights that we would hope to see from leaders like Aung San Suu Kyi.”This article has been updated with comment from Aung San Suu Kyi."

DACA was established by the Obama administration in June of 2012. It gave the opportunity for any student who had arrived to the U.S as a child, that is came to the U.S before reaching their 16th birthday and were under the age of 31 as of June 15, 2012, and met specific guidelines that proved they were in good standing as a citizen and as a student, to receive a work permit that is renewable every two years.These good standings included those who entered with U.S. without inspection, are currently in school/have their GED or are honorably discharged Veterans of the Coast Guard or Armed Forces of the United States, have not been convicted of a felony and do not pose a threat to national security. The child must also provide all their personal information to the government including how they crossed illegally and why, if applicable.Many of these DACA students, also known as Dreamers, went on to higher education, reached some of their many goals, broke that vicious familial cycle of no education, and have started a career and family. Today, the Trump Administration has put on the table the removal of this program, claiming that DACA has caused a “Humanitarian Crisis” of minors at the border. Trump mentions he needs to focus on the “Forgotten Americans” and has to put “America first,” dismissing the Dreamers as Americans, and instead insinuating they have caused a crisis in America.But there is still a bit of hope. Trump has allowed Congress six months to act and try to save the Dreamers from complete extinction. Alongside this nobody’s status will be revoked if it expires in the next 6 months, and all the applications received before today, September 5, 2017, will be processed. But in the meantime, the only option Dreamers have now is to sit and wait for Congress, and create a backup plan for the worst-case scenario, that is, DACA being shut down completely by March 5th, 2018. Supposing Congress does not act on this, and DACA is terminated at the sixth month mark ICE has the information available of each of the nearly 800,000 Dreamers to go into their house and deport them if they feel necessary. For the next six months the Dreamers will be on the edge of their seat putting all their hope on Congress."
30,RELIGION,Managing Christianity Into Impotence,"Terry Heaton, ContributorRetired television executive; Author, 'The Gospel of Self: How...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/managing-christianity-into-impotence_us_59ac146ee4b0d0c16bb525e6,"The difference between managers and leaders lies in the conceptions they hold, deep in their psyches, of chaos and order.",2017-09-05,<p>Mentions of the word “manager” in books from 1800 to 2000 AD</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59ac15b51700002500288016.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The industrial revolution brought with it a business term that dominated the twentieth century as corporations began to seize control of even culture itself. The term is “manager,” a person responsible for controlling or administering all or part of a company or similar organization. Managers brought about systems of order that governed every aspect of business life and eventually were assumed by nearly every organization in Western civilization, including churches, schools, finance, and especially the law.The Google Ngram below shows that the term “manager” used in books over the last 200 years shot up in the early part of the century and continued to rise in the decades after.In 1973, John D. Rockefeller III wrote in The Second American Revolution, Some Personal Observations:“An organization is a system, with a logic of its own, and all the weight of tradition and inertia. The deck is stacked in favor of the tried and proven way of doing things and against the taking of risks and striking out in new directions.”And so the era of the manager in the West was best suited to a conservative personality that governs by process, rules, systems, rationality, and control. The institutions of the Twentieth Century each adopted this concept, including much of Christianity and especially Evangelicalism. Churches embraced the risk-free, tried and true, and through marketing and management science, applied techniques that gave the best chance for growth. We did this at CBN in the 1980s, and you’ll find it in most churches today.In 1977, the brilliant Abraham Zaleznik of the Harvard Business School noticed that managerial development was missing key personality elements that could add a certain dynamism to corporate culture. He published a remarkable paper, “Managers and Leaders: Are They Different,” in which he (rightly) identified what was missing in the era of the manager. Here’s the way the Harvard Business Review described it:The difference between managers and leaders, he wrote, lies in the conceptions they hold, deep in their psyches, of chaos and order. Managers embrace process, seek stability and control, and instinctively try to resolve problems quickly—sometimes before they fully understand a problem’s significance. Leaders, in contrast, tolerate chaos and lack of structure and are willing to delay closure in order to understand the issues more fully. In this way, Zaleznik argued, business leaders have much more in common with artists, scientists, and other creative thinkers than they do with managers. Organizations need both managers and leaders to succeed, but developing both requires a reduced focus on logic and strategic exercises in favor of an environment where creativity and imagination are permitted to flourish.It was my great honor a week ago to speak to a small gathering of Christian Republicans about my book, The Gospel of Self: How Jesus Joined the GOP. The event was at the home of dear friends in Colorado Springs, and the people present were representative of the group I’m trying to address most with the book - namely those who use their faith and the Bible to justify a political position on the far right. It was fascinating for me, and I learned a great deal about what I can say and what I really shouldn’t say in order to pass along the message of the book. I knew this going in and was promised an audience that would probably not agree with me.When the question and answer period began, one of the first people to respond gently took me to task for intellectualizing spiritual matters, specifically comments I’d made regarding chaos and order. I had quoted Henry Adams “Chaos is the way of nature; order is the dream of man,” to which he responded that “God is a god of order, not chaos.” The whole room lit up when he made that statement, which inspired him to press on amongst the “that’s right” and “amen” responses.Christians who make this claim usually site Paul’s writing to the Church at Corinth (I Corinthians 14:33) which says that “God is not a God of disorder but of peace.” All right. Let’s look at this. This phrase is taken from the middle of a portion of Paul’s letter regarding people in the church talking over each other in a service while speaking in tongues or prophesying. This was disruptive, so Paul wrote the following to provide order during worship (NIV):Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is said. And if a revelation comes to someone who is sitting down, the first speaker should stop. For you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged. The spirits of prophets are subject to the control of prophets. For God is not a God of disorder but of peace—as in all the congregations of the Lord’s people.The point here is there is a vast difference between Paul’s simple instructions and the concept that “God is a god of order.” God is not a manager, nor is He a part of any anthropomorphized management theory created by humankind, and I repeat Henry Adams’ statement that “order is the dream of man.” The very concept of grace is chaotic, for there is no path, no formula, no system, process, or set of rules that can access the grace through which we are saved. Perhaps you disagree.Order serves the one who claims it for himself and no one else. It’s the passageway that guarantees entry into “civilization,” and against which there is no defense other than to be labeled a rebel, an anarchist, or even a terrorist. Order is the weapon of managers; leaders appreciate the value of order but they will never be a slave to it. Order is manipulable by those who sit atop its pedestal, for that is one of its key purposes - to keep in power those who make the rules. Order is the tool of empire builders, and it’s overrated as a cultural necessity. Oh of course we need order, but what we don’t need is to make a religion out of it, for the reason Jesus was born was to remind us that we cannot live by rules alone. “There is none righteous, no not one” and “The just shall live by faith.” We are selfish and self-centered at core, and if given the chance, we’ll take advantage of whatever we can - including order - to better position ourselves against our neighbors.Christianity disrupted the status quo in the beginning, and not because it was a religion of order. Its power to change hearts was in its demonstration of unconditional love in the face of great cultural corruption. It was up close and personal with individual sacrifice at its core. Its power came not from words but from the actions of its followers. Today we have often magnificent buildings with neat rows and orderly worship processes that allow for two or three services on any given Sunday morning. There is a stage. There is an audience. Every task is greeted with an organized program. There’s a program for evangelism. There’s a program for funding this or that. There’s a program for the young, for the old, for the married, for the single, and even those to assist in the helping of others. Growth and bigness are signs of health. Chaos is the enemy, but does such sterility really serve the task we’ve each been given?The Law of Moses and the Prophets depicts a God of order, but the redeemer reveals a God of grace. If Heaven is your goal, which would you prefer? Grace is deliberately chaotic in order to prevent people from building a ladder to it, so as to secure it for themselves. Grace doesn’t care if we agree or disagree. The favor of God cannot be earned, and where is the order in that? It’s just so unfair to those of the manager culture and those who’ve used management development practices to create enormous worship centers that tickle the ears of believers and feed their appetites for emotional fulfillment and a warm sense of belonging. In so doing, however, it takes the very life out of Christianity as represented by the red words in the Bible, those chaotic words meant to destroy the idols of man, including order.The Light of the world has been managed into darkness, and so it goes."

And long term it’s going to be the right solution.”William Gheen of Americans for Legal Immigration, which advocates for restricting immigration into this country, was not happy. “He’s implying that Congress should pass amnesty instead of him.”Unfortunately for Trump, immigration hard-liners make up a disproportionate chunk of that 35 percent of the nation that still approves of his job performance.“That’s not what those stadiums full of people wanted,” Gheen said. “Donald Trump is letting a lot of Americans down today.”Gheen and others who want to limit immigration point to a Phoenix rally on Aug. 31, 2016, when Trump gave his word on ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA.“We will immediately terminate President Obama’s two illegal executive amnesties in which he defied federal law and the Constitution to give amnesty to approximately 5 million illegal immigrants,” Trump said, referring to DACA and a related program that was blocked by the courts.But almost exactly three years earlier, Trump met with a handful of so-called Dreamers ― named for the acronym of the failed legislation that sought to protect them ― during which he reportedly told them that they had persuaded him on the issue. And since taking office, Trump has on numerous occasions talked about his “heart” and his “compassion” toward the DACA enrollees.These conflicting statements follow a pattern of Trump’s personality, in which appears to want to please or at least avoid a confrontation with whatever group he happens to be speaking to at the moment.When meeting with the DACA recipients, he told them what they wanted to hear. Then, in front of a rally crowd, he told them what he thought they wanted to hear.“He doesn’t like conflict,” said one Republican consultant close to the Trump White House, who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to speak candidly about the president.So, the consultant said, after having promised his voting base one thing and DACA kids the opposite, Trump decided to offload the issue onto Congress, which should have dealt with it in the first place.“This is checkmate for him,” the adviser said of Trump’s strategy, adding that Trump has many times made clear he empathizes with the plight of the DACA recipients. “He thinks more of the Dreamers than he does of Republican leaders in Congress.”That punt-to-Congress tactic was accepted Tuesday, if not necessarily embraced, by some of DACA’s most strident critics. Ira Mehlman of the Federation for American Immigration Reform also wished Trump had acted sooner. “We can’t go back and change the past. The announcement today is that it’s going to be phased out.” Mehlman added that he expects Trump to force Democrats to “come to the table” and work to fix border security and eliminate the benefits of coming to this country illegally. “And then we can figure out how to deal with this.”But to Gheen, the fact that he and his group have to deal with the issue at all with Trump in the Oval Office is maddening.“We’re miffed now that we’re having to fight Trump’s amnesty. Those are two powerful words that we never thought we’d have to put together: Trump possessive ‘s’ amnesty,” Gheen said."
32,LATINO VOICES,Trump's Evangelical Advisors Urged Him To Protect Dreamers,Antonia Blumberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trumps-evangelical-advisors-urged-him-to-protect-dreamers_us_59aee4f9e4b0354e440d0d37,One advisor says the six-month window afforded to DACA is evidence of evangelicals' influence on the president.,2017-09-05,"President Trump bows his head during a prayer while surrounded by U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, faith leaders and evangelical ministers after signing a proclamation declaring a day of prayer in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Friday, Sept. 1, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59af132f1400002000fa8256.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump’s decision to terminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals has drawn harsh criticism from faith leaders around the country who called for more compassionate treatment of young undocumented immigrants.Rev. Gabriel Salguero, president of the National Latino Evangelical Coalition, said in a statement that the president’s decision would put him “at odds with what the majority of Latino evangelicals have endorsed for over a decade.”Rev. José H. Gomez, the Archbishop of Los Angeles, called the announcement “a national tragedy and a moral challenge to every conscience.”In a statement released last week, Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, a member of Trump’s own unofficial evangelical advisory board, said: “If the president breaks his promise to us to protect these children, they should be prepared for a mass exodus of the administration’s Hispanic support.”But for some of Trump’s evangelical advisors, the administration’s announcement on Tuesday was evidence of the influence they can have on the president.Rev. Tony Suarez was one of the several evangelical advisors, along with Rodriguez, who met with the president on Friday to ask that he protect Dreamers, a term used to describe undocumented immigrants who arrived in the United States as children.“There’s a sense of vindication today for why we should stay on the advisory council,” Suarez, who serves as executive vice president of National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, told HuffPost on Tuesday. “Our voice was heard.”The pastor said he disagreed with the administration’s decision to rescind DACA without a permanent solution in place. But he said he believed his and other advisors’ work to promote protections for young undocumented immigrants may have affected the president’s decision to offer a six-month window before the program would officially end.“We worked tirelessly with the administration to make sure there are provisions in place so that the children can still be protected,” he said.“A week ago when it started becoming clear DACA would come to an end it seemed there would be no other solution,” the pastor added. “But under the current plan, there’s a six-month window for Congress to act and a two-year extension for children currently enrolled in the DACA program. That’s a direct outcome of our work.”The Trump administration announced on Tuesday that it would end DACA in six months and punt the matter to Congress. The decision puts nearly 800,000 young undocumented immigrants at risk of deportation if the president and members of the House and Senate can’t make a deal to protect them before then.The announcement comes on the Sept. 5 deadline set by 10 state attorneys general who threatened legal action if Trump did not announce a phaseout of DACA by that date. DACA opponents have long held that the program, which President Barack Obama enacted in 2012, constituted an executive overreach and interfered with the enforcement of immigration laws.Suarez said he and Rodriguez, who serves as president of the NHCLC, have used their presence on Trump’s evangelical board to fight for Dreamers over the past year.“This has been an ongoing effort to make sure we’re being a voice for the voiceless,” he said.On Friday, Suarez and Rodriguez video conferenced in to a meeting with Trump where, through an emissary, they delivered over 1,000 signatures from pastors advocating for immigrants protected by DACA. Other evangelical advisors, including Pastor Jentezen Franklin, were present at the meeting to add their voices. “I know these kids,” Franklin recalled telling the president in an interview with The Washington Post. The pastor said he noted Trump’s love for his own children and urged the president: “I want to see that kind of heart toward these children.”That heart came through, in Suarez’s eyes, with the administration’s creation of a six-month window in which Congress can now act.“It was discussed to just simply end DACA with no kind of ‘grace period.’ We said, ‘You can’t just end the program and allow these children to be vulnerable because of the sins of their parents,’” Suarez said, qualifying that he meant “sin” in the broadest sense.Asked whether he believed Trump had broken a promise, as Rodriguez warned, Suarez responded: “If he’d ended DACA without a provision then, yes, we would feel let down. But he heard us. He had compassion for these children and has given them an extension of time.”Now, the pastor said, the onus is on Congress to devise a plan to protect young undocumented immigrants who might otherwise face deportation. To that end, the NHCLC and partner organizations are launching a 60-day campaign to petition Congress to take action.Suarez said: “We’re calling on Congress to not take six months but 60 days and give this as a Christmas present to undocumented children in this country.”"

Seriously, there’s been a few each weekend ever since June’s Pride Month. While revelers clean off the glitter after recent celebrations in Montreal, Manchester, and New Orleans, others ready for more festivities sine the party is never quite over when it comes to celebrating the community, the accomplishments made, and to simply have a good time. If you didn't get to make it to any LGBT events this year yet, or just want to keep it going, here what you can attend this fall:Folsom EuropeSeptember 6-10If you're into leather, BDSM, or another kink subculture, then you might want to experience a Folsom event some time in your life. A celebration of fetishes with a focus on leather and BDSM, the original Folsom Street event takes place in San Francisco every year in September (the 24th this year). Inspired by Folsom Street, Folsom Europe in Berlin was established in 2003 and is the largest gay fetish event in Europe.Dallas PrideSeptember 14-17Travel to queer Dallas is year-round with its gayborhood in the intersection of Cedar Springs Road and Oak Lawn Avenue. The city's main LGBT entertainment district, it offers LGBT shopping, bars, and nightlife, and is also the main meet up point and party spot during Dallas Pride. For the 2017 edition, the main events will take over two days instead of one. The Miller Lite Music Festival in the Park will happen on September 16 (which will include a concert series from local bands and the headline acts of dance and electronic singer Kristine W and international drag superstar Alyssa Edwards), and the Alan Ross Texas Freedom Parade the next day down Cedar Springs. A couple different parties are also held leading up the Pride weekend. Check out some here.Caribbean Pride September 16-23Something brand new to consider this year is Caribbean Pride in Punta Cana. Taking over CHIC Punta Cana from September 16 to 23, this event is the first of its kind in the Dominican Republic. According to the hosts, the vision for the event was to create a welcoming experience for members of the LGBT community, and they thought no better place for the inaugural event than this adults-only resort property that is said to epitomize style with a social vacation experience. With wanting to join in the global fun of pride celebrations and to foster a sense of acceptance and inclusivity, the events and activities during the week range from pool-side and beach parties to drag queen bingo to pole dancing classes to a fashion show.Curaçao PrideSeptember 28 - October 1Hosting its fifth edition of Curaçao Pride, the four day long event will be filled with plenty of parties and activities. More than 1,000 people are expected to participate this year, and it all starts with the Pride walk across the Queen Emma Bridge. Last year was the first time the island hosted a Pride walk, and it was so successful that the organizers are making sure to bringing it back. Most of the parties will be hosted at the adults-only, LGBT-friendly Floris Suite Hotel, and there’s also a Pride sail around the beautiful island.Miss’d America PageantOctober 7A night of glamour and camp, the Miss’d America Pageant brings together some of the nation's talented drag queens to compete for the coveted title - and they do so all for a good cause!

There are also live concerts held where the parade ends to close out the Pride event. Buenos Aires has become a top LGBT destination over the years, and the parade (or Marcha del Orgullo) attracts more than 100,000 people."
34,POLITICS,Trump And Sessions Suggested Dreamers' Fate Was Already Sealed In Court. It Wasn't.,Elise Foley and Ryan J. Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dreamers-daca-decision-trump-sessions_us_59aee270e4b0354e440d079a,The president was the one who chose to end DACA protections for young undocumented immigrants.,2017-09-05,"People march against the Trump administration's decision to end DACA on Sept. 5 in Washington, D.C.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59aef7841700001f0028859a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― In rescinding a program to protect young undocumented immigrants, the Trump administration insisted on Tuesday that its hands were tied by the courts. If they didn’t end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, President Donald Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions argued, it would inevitably be blocked by the judicial branch.But in reality, the legal fate of DACA was far from inevitable. The court decision that Sessions mentioned in his announcement involved a much broader immigration program proposed by then-President Barack Obama that has never been fully judicially adjudicated.“Our collective wisdom is that the [DACA] policy is vulnerable to the same legal and constitutional challenges that the courts recognized with respect to the DAPA program, which was enjoined on a nationwide basis in a decision affirmed by the 5th Circuit,” Sessions said Tuesday.Yet the federal courts never came to a final determination on the constitutionality of DAPA, otherwise known as the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents program. While a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld a temporary injunction on DAPA, its fate was never sealed.Rather than responding to some inescapable legal reasoning, the Trump administration has caved to a threat against DACA by state attorneys general ― although the president said otherwise. Trump said in a statement that “officials from 10 States are suing over the program, requiring my Administration to make a decision regarding its legality.” That is not true. While 10 state attorneys general said they would take legal action if Trump didn’t end DACA by Sept. 5, they have not sued, and one of the 10 has actually backed off his threat. It’s pretty extraordinary for an administration to throw in the towel based on an internal assessment before a lawsuit was even filed. The Obama administration came under attack from congressional Republicans when it decided not to defend the Defense of Marriage Act in court. But the law still stood ― and the Supreme Court eventually sided with the Obama administration’s judgment.Trump’s statement claimed that “the Attorney General of the United States, the Attorneys General of many states, and virtually all other top legal experts have advised that the program is unlawful and unconstitutional and cannot be successfully defended in court.”There isn’t really such a grand legal consensus against DACA. Just last month, 105 law professors signed an open letter explicitly stating that there was “no question” that DACA was “a lawful exercise of prosecutorial discretion.”In DAPA’s case, a federal judge granted a temporary injunction against the initiative going into effect in February 2015. U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen, a George W. Bush nominee, made clear that he was not ruling on the merits of the arguments.“It is far preferable to have the legality of these actions determined before the fates of over four million individuals are decided. An injunction is the only way to accomplish that goal,” Hanen wrote, concluding that an injunction was the only way to keep the “status quo” in place.One of Hanen’s concerns was the fate of the undocumented immigrants who might provide personal information to the government in applying for DAPA protections. He warned there could be “dire consequences” for those who came out of the shadows if DAPA were later found to be illegal or unconstitutional.“The DHS [Department of Homeland Security] ― whether under this administration or the next ― will then have all pertinent identifying information for these immigrants and could deport them,” the judge wrote.On appeal, a 5th Circuit motions panel ruled that the U.S. had “not made a strong showing” that it was likely to succeed on the merits in the case. “As a prudential matter, if the injunction is stayed but DAPA is ultimately invalidated, deportable aliens would have identified themselves without receiving expected benefits,” the panel wrote in May 2015.That November, a slightly different 5th Circuit panel upheld the injunction, with a 2-1 majority finding that DAPA was “foreclosed by Congress’s careful plan.” In a footnote, the majority wrote that the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 “does not grant the Secretary discretion to grant deferred action and lawful presence on a classwide basis to 4.3 million otherwise removable aliens.”The Supreme Court deadlocked with a 4-4 ruling in June 2016, which left in place the temporary block on the plan. (The high court had just eight members at the time because Senate Republicans had refused to give a hearing to Merrick Garland, the judge Obama had nominated to replace Justice Antonin Scalia.)A Justice Department official said that before the DACA announcement, Sessions had received legal advice from lawyers within the department, but declined to say who was involved. The official maintained that Sessions was facing down a court decision that would immediately end DACA and pointed toward outside legal experts who believed the program went beyond constitutional restraints. But others saw the Trump administration’s legal excuse for ending DACA as just a cover for a political decision.“Let’s be clear: the action taken today isn’t required legally. It’s a political decision, and a moral question,” said former President Obama.“This Administration cannot hide behind the excuse of DACA being ‘unlawful.’ It is not,” said Elizabeth Wydra, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center, in a statement. “The Obama Administration acted fully within its constitutional and statutory authority when it recognized that these young people should be able to live, work, and dream just like any other American.”Thomas Saenz, president and general counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, argued that Trump was “acting on tainted and biased ‘legal’ advice” when he “caved to the overstated demands of the Texas attorney general and a dwindling number of other states.”"

The Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, who’s undocumented, told HuffPost in an email that there’s much more work to do even after Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced on Tuesday that the administration was terminating the program. While DACA will officially end in six months, it’s now up to the House and Senate to formulate a solution to protect the nearly 800,000 Dreamers.  And Vargas is adamant about pushing Congress to step up and serve DACA recipients. In order for that to happen, the journalist told HuffPost, awareness must be spread regarding the program’s payoffs for both undocumented and documented Americans alike.“Don’t give up. We’re with you. The majority of the country is also outraged right now and together, we are powerful,” Vargas, who’s Filipino-American, told HuffPost of his message to Dreamers. “We will fight for a new ― and maybe even better ― solution. We’ve done it before.”Vargas called on local media outlets and allies to highlight the contributions DACA recipients in their own communities bring to society. And the activist said that there are many of them. In the Teach For America program alone, there are almost 200 educators and alumni enrolled in the DACA program who serve more than 10,000 students. A significant portion of recipients also work in healthcare with about 21 percent working in educational and health services, a survey indicated ― a particularly noteworthy statistic as the U.S. faces a projected shortage of between 40,800 and 104,900 doctors, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.“One day, that teacher won’t be able to show up for her kids. That nurse, who might be the only ray of sunshine in one of their patient’s lives, won’t be able to provide them comfort,” Vargas, who co-founded nonprofit Define American, said of the consequences of ending the program. “We have brilliant students who won’t be able to finish out their studies and give back the fruits of their knowledge.The journalist also pointed out Dreamers are a benefit to the economy as a whole. More than 90 percent of the group is currently enrolled in school or employed, according to the Center for American Progress. And DACA beneficiaries will contribute $460.3 billion to the country’s GDP over the next decade. It’s why Vargas stresses the importance of grassroots efforts to show the true value of Dreamers. While Trump’s decision makes this a difficult time for anyone benefitting from DACA, Vargas remains hopeful. And He has a few words for anyone looking to create change following Tuesday’s announcement:“There is so much information out there about what DACA actually is and the benefits it provides. We need to keep speaking up and showing up. This fight isn’t over.”"

While working on the group’s sophomore album, “BATS,” Nelson came out as gay, and acknowledged that he and Netterfield are in a relationship. Directed by Joe Agius, the “O Lord” video “challenges everything I grew up believing about masculinity, beauty and homosexuality,” Nelson said.“I had been in denial about my sexuality for a long time and I feel like that stopped me from really connecting with what I was creating. A huge weight was lifted when I came out,” he told HuffPost. “I could finally tap into what I was feeling, unhindered and unashamed.”Noting that “BATS” was written “from a really vulnerable place,” Nelson said he has “never been more excited or proud” to release new music. Due out Sept. 22, the new album is pop focused, with elements of soul and R&B, and features songs like “Good Guys Go” and “Give It To Me (Like You Mean It)” which also come from a deeply personal place. “It maps out my personal journey of coming to terms with who I am and the development of my relationship with Sam from first realizing I was in love with him,” Nelson explained, “to the moment we told each other how we felt and then all of the emotions that came with finally being together.”The singer-songwriter said he and his bandmates definitely feel a responsibility to speak out about LGBTQ issues, particularly at a time when their homeland is gearing up for a milestone marriage equality vote. “It’s an honor to be given a platform, and we want to use it to help contribute toward positive change in the world,” he said. “If we can help people come to that point of self-acceptance at a young age, it’s our hope that they’ll find inner peace and happiness earlier in life than I did.”Catch the latest in LGBTQ culture by subscribing to the Queer Voices newsletter.

Several Asian-American organizations expressed their opposition to DACA’s termination, which was announced on Tuesday. The program is scheduled to end in six months, with Congress now responsible for coming up with a solution that would preserve the program’s protections. The Obama-era program had protected nearly 800,000 young undocumented immigrants, who would be at risk for deportation if a solution cannot be reached. The National Korean American Service and Education Consortium (NAKASEC) and its affiliates HANA Center, and Korean Resource Center, along with The National Asian Pacific American Women’s Forum (NAPAWF) and many others have issued statements condemning the cancellation. “It is cruel and un-American to ruin the lives of young people who stepped forward in good faith to participate in a program that has proven to be successful,” NAKASEC’s co-director, Dae Joong Yoon, explained in a press release. “They trusted the government. Ending DACA means the country is abandoning them and all the progress we have made together.” While youth from Latin American countries make up the majority of DACA applications, Asian-Americans make up a sizable chunk of those eligible for the immigration program. Those who were previously able to request program consideration included undocumented individuals under the age of 31 as of June 15, 2012, who were brought the the U.S. before their 16th birthday and met another set of guidelines related to education and criminal background, among other issues. In 2016, South Korea, China, India and the Philippines were among the top ten countries of origin of DACA-eligible populations. The program’s termination could affect tens of thousands of members of the minority group. Some organizations accused the Trump administration of acting immorally, with the Asian Americans Advancing Justice organization stating that the termination of the program, which disproportionately helped immigrants and people of color, is further proof that the administration’s agenda “is rooted in hate and inhumanity.” And others, including NAKASEC, have challenged allies and activists alike to resist the decision and fight to protect the undocumented community whether it’s through pro-bono case work, providing sanctuaries undocumented Americans, or calling members of Congress. But many also expressed fears regarding what the termination of DACA could mean for those who’ve benefitted from the program. NAPAWF said it believes more ICE raids are looming. In July alone, more than 650 people were arrested during a four-day spree. And back in February, immigration officers and agents raided a string of Asian restaurants in Mississippi, causing alarm in the state’s immigrant communities. “We know what is going to happen next. ICE raids and months spent in detention centers and the mass deportation of people who have only known the United States as their home,” the organization wrote in a statement. “We have already seen the devastating impact of deportation on our communities, especially for AAPI women and youth. The threat of deportation tears families apart and negatively impacts their economic stability, employment, and reproductive choices.”Still, many are hoping Congress will step up to provide an acceptable, permanent solution for undocumented youth ― something AAAJ says that the administration has failed to do. “It is incumbent upon our Senators and Representatives to enact a permanent legislative solution that would once and for all protect our DACA recipients and place them on a pathway to citizenship,” the group said.

It was special in a couple of ways. For one thing it had been raised carefully on a small farm near their place in Pennsylvania – Kreeky Tree Farm; for another, it was of a breed that I’ve never run into in New York at a butcher shop or a farmers’ market stand: closely related to the highly-regarded Bresse chickens raised in France, with their characteristic blue-black legs. (Our chicken’s legs had been left on to signal its heritage.)Such a promising chicken deserved to be cooked simply, maybe roasted, or poached in stock with a creamy sauce made from the poaching liquid. Or – aha! – maybe pot-roasted. Pot-roasting is an underappreciated method for a whole chicken. But it has the appeal of regular roasting – it yields a golden-skinned object to be presented before carving if you like that kind of theater – with a few advantages. On the cooking side, once it is under way it requires little attention and timing is somewhat flexible. You could say the same of roasting, but few cooks can resist poking and monitoring even if they profess a minimalist just-throw-it-in-the-oven philosophy. True, you don’t get crackling skin, but after proper resting (20 or 30 minutes) even the crunchiest-skinned roast chicken will lose its crispness unless you fry it or torch it.And on the plate, you get particularly flavorful flesh with thoroughly cooked dark meat and – unless you go out for a five-mile run and forget to retrieve the pot from the oven – breast meat that remains sufficiently moist (though it will never be as perfect as when the breast is cooked separately and attentively). Moreover, even though mostly cooked in a covered pan, it does not taste braised or stewed or steamed: it tastes very much like roast chicken.Pot roasting is not complicated, though it begins with two extra steps. Here’s how I do it. I start an hour or a day ahead by seasoning the chicken generously with salt and pepper and cramming the cavity with mixed fresh herbs, more or less whatever you’ve got around. Try to include thyme or rosemary; other than that, you’re on your own. I then truss the chicken, not for the sake of so-called even cooking, but for ease of handling and for good looks. There are dozens of ways to do this, some using a big needle and some just string; I have no favorite method. Look at books or on-line videos and take your pick, so long as you end up with a compact football of chicken whose extremities do not flop around when you manipulate the chicken.Heat the oven to a little higher than 350º F (say, 180º C). In a heavy casserole, preferably oval rather than round and big enough to hold the chicken snugly – I use Staub or Le Creuset enameled cast iron – lightly brown the chicken in a little butter or oil. Do this over medium-low heat, and give it four or five minutes on each “side”. If there are places that do not get browned, don’t worry about it, but ensure that the sides (drumsticks, thighs and wings) and the fore-end of the breast take on some color.Meanwhile, slice an onion (or leek) and a carrot or two, and fetch a big clove of garlic (leave it whole, skin on or off). When the chicken is golden, remove it to a plate and put the vegetables into the casserole along with any poultry trimmings (wing tips, wishbone, skin scraps – and in this case feet); brown them lightly. Add butter (for flavor) and herbs – some or all of the ones inside the chicken – then douse with half a cup (120 ml) white wine, turn up the heat and boil it down until it no longer tastes or smells raw. Now add liquid – stock is ideal, but water will do – to just submerge the vegetables, and set the chicken on this base, adding any juices or fat that have accumulated on the plate it’s been resting on. Cover the casserole and put it in the oven.An hour later (a little longer for a chicken much bigger than 3-1/2 pounds – 1.6 kg), remove the lid, make sure the liquid hasn’t disappeared (this is unlikely) and return the casserole to the oven, uncovered, for another 20 or 25 minutes. That should do it: grab one of the legs; if the thigh joint has loosened and wiggles easily even though trussed in place, you’re okay. It is that one-hour covered cooking time that’s a little flexible. You wouldn’t want to cook it much less than an hour, but if you left it in the oven for an hour and a quarter during that phase the chicken would not dry out.Move the chicken, which will be browner than it was when you first browned it, onto a plate, lay a piece of foil over it (the foil is optional) and leave it alone for anywhere between 15 and 45 minutes. Put the casserole over medium-high heat, add stock (or water if that’s all you’ve got, in which case consider adding a tablespoon of good soy sauce) and boil until the sauce is delicious. And, because in this kind of cooking the chicken contributes a great deal to the juices, it will be delicious. Strain out the vegetables and scraps, pressing lightly to get as much goodness out of them as possible, let the fat rise to the surface and get rid of as much of it as you like. Simmer the sauce, checking for seasoning and, if you like, finishing with some chopped herbs, but not a lot.Carve and serve. The delicious birthday-present chicken was served with corn fritters; a few nights later, an excellent free-range chicken from a good butcher was cooked in the same way and was eaten with minty eggplant (like the one I wrote about a while ago, but without the dates). Make soup or stock from the carcass; make Coronation Chicken or patties (call them rissoles or kotlety or croquettes if you like) with any leftover meat.This could become your favorite way of “roasting” chicken."

Foremost on their mind is usually what’s the best way to treat it and what does the future hold. It can be an upsetting time for a man and his family and even more so if his knowledge of prostate cancer treatment options is limited. Not knowing what is available or what course of action to take can possibly set him on the wrong track of knowing how best to fight it.Men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer are often scared with not completely understanding what prostate cancer means. That’s okay. I’m here to help them. By reassuring them there are many ways to treat prostate cancer, every step of his journey is guided in determining what is best for each individual man. That gives him the feeling of being in charge of his health care decisions. By earning his trust, both of us together can improve his chances of coming out cancer free in the end.Prostate gland and prostate cancer statisticsThe prostate is a gland of the male reproductive system which sits below the bladder and in front of the rectum. Its function is to produce a fluid that contributes to the formation of semen. Normally the size of a walnut in younger men, the prostate can grow much larger as a man agesProstate cancer is when cells in the prostate gland grow uncontrollably. According to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) approximately 14 percent of men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer at some point during their lifetime, based on 2010-2012 data. Other than skin cancer, prostate cancer is the most common cancer in American men. The American Cancer Society’s estimates for this disease in the United States for 2017 is around 161,360 new cases and about 26,730 men will succumb to prostate cancer.However, if prostate cancer is discovered in its early stages, it has a 98.9 percent survival rate as reported from the NCI.Treatment optionsEach individual patient’s prostate cancer treatment depends on many factors – the man’s age, overall health, staging of the cancer and its location. Tailoring a treatment plan best suited for each patient’s unique needs is necessary to have the best outcome. When the options available are thoroughly explained, a man and his physician will be better prepared to choose the one right for himThe best defense is to have a game plan of good offense when it comes to prostate cancer.Women are very good about getting yearly checkups. Men need to do the same and have yearly exams to assess what is going on with their prostate. A simple rectal exam which takes less than a minute and a yearly PSA blood test starting at age 40 are good screening tools urologists use to detect any changes in the prostate gland. Not getting screened is unwise and a man will be missing his opportunity to catch any changes before it’s too late.If abnormalities are found with either the rectal exam or the PSA test, from there the doctor may decide to do a prostate biopsy to obtain tissue samples from the prostate gland. The samples of tissue are screened for the size, shape, and pattern of growth of possible cancer cells and will be assigned what is called a Gleason score. The Gleason score is used to describe the aggressiveness of the cancer cells and to predict prognosis and to determine what therapy is best for the patient.Determination will be made if further imaging tests are required which could include computed tomography (CT) scan and or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).If prostate cancer is confirmed, then treatment options will be decided depending on what stage the cancer is in. One option a man and his doctor may decide to do is called active surveillance. This is the decision not to treat prostate cancer at the time of diagnosis based on the man’s age, health condition and the rate of growth of the cancer.Prostate cancer needing more aggressive treatment depends upon the expected rate of growth, staging and other factors. The doctor may decide to choose one type of therapy or a combination to beat back the cancer. His choices range from the da Vinci prostatectomy, radiation therapy, Cyberknife SBRT procedure, IMRT procedure, seed implant procedure, or hormone therapy.All men need to be familiar with their bodies and know signs and symptoms when something doesn’t seem right. But with prostate cancer there often may not be many symptoms or they seem vague and unimportant. Be your own health advocate. The best way to fight off this potential killer is to get regular checkups, understand the prostate and prostate cancer and find a urologist who will guide you through the battle every step of the way.Dr. Samadi is a board-certified urologic oncologist trained in open and traditional and laparoscopic surgery and is an expert in robotic prostate surgery.

The sound was terrifying; many residents thought an earthquake had finally sliced the city in two. As is now second nature to me, I hopped on my phone and frantically tried to connect with the women from the journalism program I founded, Sahar Speaks. Our busy Facebook chat, usually crowded with feminist memes and sparkling heart emojis, had taken a dark turn. The ladies were heavily distraught. Some posted photos of the smashed glass belonging to their homes. One alumna, with heartbreaking candor, asked, “Just survived a bomb blast. Who knows when our turn will come?” Another wrote, “One day we’ll be taken, too.” I’ll forever worry about them. Because the brutal reality is that they are there, and I am not. I got to choose when to leave Afghanistan; they have almost no agency in the matter. More than a year has passed since the voices of our first graduates were introduced to the world. After receiving training in Kabul and mentorships with experienced female journalists around the world, all 12 published stories on HuffPost. It was historic, marking the first time a global media outlet published the work of so many Afghan female journalists. Before Sahar Speaks, there was not a single Afghan woman working for any of the international, English-language media outlets in Kabul. This systemic failure created a gaping hole in the country’s foreign coverage, in which the genders are largely separated. Afghan women’s stories were being relayed to the world by Afghan men, foreign men and foreign women.We changed that. As the Afghan proverb goes, patience is bitter but its fruit is sweet. And once we gave a taste of Afghanistan-based, high-quality journalism from local women, they were suddenly in high demand. Just to name some of the successes of our alumnae over the past year: Alia Rajai became a reporter and producer for BBC Persian. Sonia Azatyar became a contributor at Truthdig. Shougofa Alikozay joined the Australia-based Freethinker Co. storytelling platform. Nadia Zahel continued her brilliant work on national television.Sahar Fetrat won a spot at a peace forum in Switzerland and set up her own film company in Kabul. Zahra Joya was invited to Nepal to talk at a feminist workshop.Photographers Tahmina Saleem and Mariam Alimi have been published internationally, including in News Deeply and Al Jazeera.And The New York Times made the bold and inspiring step of hiring Afghanistan’s first female journalist for an English-language outlet, our alumna Zahra Nader.Last August, within weeks of beginning at the Times, Nader landed her first co-bylined story on the front page. Despite the Taliban’s notorious disdain for women, she managed to speak to several former and current members of the group to get the story. Marking International Women’s Day in March, she wrote a full-page spread about how the largely symbolic holiday feels in the worst place to celebrate it.Late last year, a new round of 10 Afghan female journalists were trained in Kabul, focusing on photography and videography skills. This was done intentionally; there is a dearth of visual female journalists in Afghanistan. And, as we have seen with the first round, only Afghan women can gain access to the stories of their women and truly unlock the conversations that affect them.In the words of one participant from Kandahar, the birthplace of the Taliban, “I see stories when I sleep, and I want to show them to everyone.” Our participants were an eclectic group, coming from across the country. Some were just starting out in visual storytelling; others were passionate photographers. The depiction of women in photography interested them greatly. When asked to bring their favorite photo to class, one woman brought the iconic Vietnam War photograph by Associated Press photographer Nick Ut that showed a naked girl running from a napalm attack. The group was inspired by photographer Steve McCurry’s “Afghan Girl,” which appeared on the cover of National Geographic in 1985. Her piercing green eyes became an enduring image of their country at war. When they discovered that McCurry’s work has since been embroiled in a Photoshop controversy, the group was crestfallen. One of our mentors, Istanbul-based photographer Monique Jacques, managed ― through a spectacularly complicated network of fellow journalists and volunteers traveling to Kabul ― to donate gently used DSLRs, so the women could begin shooting on real cameras instead of using smartphones. Something felt different this time, a year and a half after the first group had been trained. The women in the second round are mostly young, many still university students, and their lives have been shaped by the NATO-led war. The majority were first-graders when a U.S.-backed coalition ousted the Taliban at the end of 2001.Now, as Washington wrestles with what to do in Afghanistan, where it has waged its longest-ever war, the United States finds itself in a new position: How to win an unwinnable conflict? Should it have another troop surge, or does it take another stab at nation-building? Either way, everyone knows there is no easy fix when it comes to Afghanistan.In late July, Afghans were on the receiving end of President Donald Trump’s laconic boorishness when he told top Pentagon officials, “We’ve been there for now close to 17 years, and I want to find out why we’ve been there for 17 years.” After spending his entire presidential campaign criticizing the war as a “disaster,” Trump in late August finally said he had a plan for Afghanistan, involving more troops, though the details were vague. Reportedly he was spurred to boost the U.S. presence after being shown a famous 1972 photograph of Afghan women in miniskirts in Kabul as proof that Western ideals can be effective there.The young women of Sahar Speaks can tell Trump what the U.S. has been doing in their country for most of their lives. Trillions of dollars of U.S. taxpayers’ money has been spent, mostly on supplying U.S. troops and training a large Afghan army and police force. Billions of dollars of aid money was notoriously misspent. Civilian deaths are at their highest in 16 years, and Afghan troops are being killed in ever-greater numbers. Islamic State has made inroads. The current unity government led by President Ashraf Ghani is incredibly weak: as of the start of this year, the Taliban controls almost half of the country. Many of the women also benefited from U.S. intervention. They learned English at American-funded institutions and were given the opportunity to attend university, despite their gender. They were encouraged. They enjoyed some semblance of civil society. They were given a glimpse ― albeit some would say fleetingly ― of what it looks like to live in a world where women have more rights.But now, where once there was hope, there is a vacuum. The young women of contemporary Afghanistan live under the long shadow of a void, of what was meant to be a better life. This is reflected in their stories, which are told with a mixture of poignancy and urgency, a reaction to what many see as a broken promise. "

Another author on this site published an op-ed griping that feminists had failed to show up for Swift during her trial ― a claim that I found not only inaccurate but incredibly ironic given the public and vocal “girl squad-feminist”’s complete absence from a literally inescapable conversation centering around the president of the United States admitting to committing sexual assault ― and it finally seemed as if the “Taylor is Over” party that took place after Kim Kardashian’s Snapchat frenzy was over.So the return of Taylor, with her upcoming sixth studio album reputation, seemed like a chance for the singer to continue working her way into the public’s good graces after a period that even President Trump’s PR team would have characterized as rough. It felt like the general public were preparing to welcome home their favorite All-American good girl, as we did with Kesha whose comeback album after her difficult public period went straight in at #1.But instead, it seems as if Taylor played the wrong hand. A lead single that dragged the entire conversation around her image back into the most toxic period of her career, “Look What You Made Me Do” was not just purely reactionary, it was boring. The woman who put out the brilliant song that is “Blank Space,” meeting her critics’ gaze with a ferociously playful acknowledgment that, yes, she too was in on the joke had released what can best be described as an unironic, coldly generic number. It brought to mind a word I had never before used to describe a Taylor Swift song: reductive. Sure, the music video helped, with the multiple Taylors trading barbs at the end serving as a heavy-handed nod to public sentiment, but even that felt less tongue-in-cheek and more self-righteously enraged. The old Taylor, dramatically murdered in the song’s bridge, would have laughed with the rest of us. The new Taylor seems determined to pin everything on others, and, by extension, us.What I think is so disappointing about the Taylor Swift of 2017, ultimately, is that she’s not saying much of anything anymore, in her music or in her life. Not only do we live in a political and artistic moment where artists are increasingly energized to return to the tradition of resisting through their craft, but Swift in the past has been one of the most expressive, personal songwriters in the pop industry. Her vulnerable, honest lyrics were a breath of fresh air in a genre dominated by computer generated mundanity. For her to have traded in painfully direct songs for generic quasi-sexual moans in her new song “...Ready For It?” feels like a blow not just to her legacy as an artist but to an industry that desperately needs more of her kind of authenticity. Add to that her complete silence during a time when young women across the country need all the role models they can get, and when violent, racist heteromasculinity threatens to undo us, and her absence looms larger than it ought to.In the same way that many of Swift’s fans have come after music critics and media outlets for waxing poetic about the same details of her reinvention, working them over until they lose all meaning, so Swift has erased herself from her own music. “Look What You Made Me Do” and “...Ready For It?” could easily have come out of Ariana Grande’s or Selena Gomez’s catalogues. The agency, conscious and indignantly self-determinant, that Swift exhibited on albums like Fearless and Red has been traded in for songs and videos handled by and narratively owned by men (Jack Antonoff, Joseph Kahn, Max Martin). Her controversial promotional tactics, including buying expensive merchandise for an increased chance at purchasing tickets for her upcoming tour, seem less empowering a la Sheryl Sandberg and more cynical, like a record label boss. We expect the big men to milk their fans for every cent to gain a profit, but Taylor Swift? It seems like the antithesis of her entire brand.It’s sad to think what Taylor Swift could have meant in the Trump presidency. Sure, she would still have had an uncomfortably close relationship with Black culture in a manner that verged on downright appropriative, but that brutal honesty would have been a change of pace (and likely more successful than Katy Perry’s half-baked attempt at the same). A new generation of female singers in her image have risen to critical acclaim ― Lorde and Alessia Cara to name two ― but Swift seems more eager than I expected to let them claim her old authority. Swift will continue to be successful, to generate drama, and to win both awards and commercial acclaim. But she will do so by punching down, by taking cheap shots, and by, if her music so far is any indication, trying her best to disappear into the background. And that, honestly, is a real shame."

A minute-long montage of incendiary campaign lowlights rolls by: talk of “draining the swamp” and building a wall, news broadcasts babbling about Clinton’s emails, Trump proponents rallying in his name. If anyone still had time to feel election-season anxiety, the reel would require a trigger warning. Then, the screen goes black, and a title card announces that it is Nov. 8, 2016. The night everything came tumbling down.“American Horror Story: Cult” could end there. It would be plenty terrifying. For better and worse, it does not. After the show’s signature opening credits, we see the back of Kai Anderson (a blue-haired Evan Peters), hunched over his couch as Fox News calls the election in Trump’s favor. “The revolution has begun,” he says to no one, rising to hump the television with stony-eyed intensity.Meanwhile, restauranteurs Ally Mayfair-Richards (Sarah Paulson) and Ivy Mayfair-Richards (Alison Pill) ― a married couple with a young son ― are hosting a party. The mood has turned sour. “Go to hell, Huffington Post,” Ally yells in protest. “Fuck you, Nate Silver.” Across the first three “Cult” episodes, Trump and Clinton appear again only in references, direct and veiled. But the lines are drawn, as they have been across a politically cloven America. The aforementioned characters will intersect, along with a handful of others ― Ally’s therapist (Cheyenne Jackson), a bleach-blond detective (Colton Haynes), an accomplice of Kai who becomes Ally and Ivy’s mischievous nanny (Billie Lourd) ― while the election’s televised terrors bleed into everyday manifestations.Chief among them: clowns.’Tis the season.

Everyone seems to be asking, “Are you for us or against us?” Sounds familiar.One thing’s certain: “Cult” has a killer hook. We don’t know who’s hiding behind those clown masks, and that’s enough to sustain tension. Unfortunately, connecting audacious tissue has never been Murphy’s speciality, and that’s what this season will need going forward. There’s still a parade of actors slated to appear (Frances Conroy, Emma Roberts, Mare Winningham, Lena Dunham), which still doesn’t quite rectify the absence of older veterans like Jessica Lange, Kathy Bates, Angela Bassett and James Cromwell. But as the terrors on our televisions and internet screens multiply, “Cult” could work its way toward resonance.In these paranoid times, there’s more than enough material. “American Horror Story: Cult” premieres Sept. 5 on FX."

A minute-long montage of incendiary campaign lowlights rolls by: talk of “draining the swamp” and building a wall, news broadcasts babbling about Clinton’s emails, Trump proponents rallying in his name. If anyone still had time to feel election-season anxiety, the reel would require a trigger warning. Then, the screen goes black, and a title card announces that it is Nov. 8, 2016. The night everything came tumbling down.“American Horror Story: Cult” could end there. It would be plenty terrifying. For better and worse, it does not. After the show’s signature opening credits, we see the back of Kai Anderson (a blue-haired Evan Peters), hunched over his couch as Fox News calls the election in Trump’s favor. “The revolution has begun,” he says to no one, rising to hump the television with stony-eyed intensity.Meanwhile, restauranteurs Ally Mayfair-Richards (Sarah Paulson) and Ivy Mayfair-Richards (Alison Pill) ― a married couple with a young son ― are hosting a party. The mood has turned sour. “Go to hell, Huffington Post,” Ally yells in protest. “Fuck you, Nate Silver.” Across the first three “Cult” episodes, Trump and Clinton appear again only in references, direct and veiled. But the lines are drawn, as they have been across a politically cloven America. The aforementioned characters will intersect, along with a handful of others ― Ally’s therapist (Cheyenne Jackson), a bleach-blond detective (Colton Haynes), an accomplice of Kai who becomes Ally and Ivy’s mischievous nanny (Billie Lourd) ― while the election’s televised terrors bleed into everyday manifestations.Chief among them: clowns.’Tis the season.

As it turns out, the peppy Pollyanna behind characters like Kimmy Schmidt from “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt” and Erin Hannon from “The Office” owes some of her signature charm to the city that raised her: St. Louis, Missouri.“Midwesterners have a reputation for being above-average friendly, but St. Louis takes the cake,” the actress said over email. As HuffPost embarks on a nationwide tour called “Listen to America,” which aims to capture voices of people and places often under-heard in national media, we asked some famous faces to reflect back on their hometowns, too.For Kemper, that meant the home of the Cardinals (“St. Louis fans are the greatest in the world”), the experimental City Museum and some famous architecture ― she likes Christmas Eve at the Cathedral Basilica, a century-old church known for elaborate mosaics, and recommends the documentary “Monument to the Dream” to learn more about the Gateway Arch. “Of course, I love the food,” Kemper added. “House of India and Ted Drewes are my idea of heaven on earth.”And like anyone who moved far away from the place they grew up, the actress only really noticed her city’s unique personality thanks to her time spent away from it ― first when she went to college, at Princeton.“Walking through the campus of my college in the Northeast, I quickly learned that it was not normal to smile at people whom you did not know. This required some adjusting on my part; in St. Louis, most people peppered interactions ― even with strangers ― with smiles,” she said. “I had made only one friend so far, Kate Fox, and I knew that she was the real deal. As I told my mom on the phone one night, ‘When someone smiles at Kate, she smiles back.’”Back in St. Louis, that sort of kindness never seems in short supply.“I have never once had a rude encounter at a grocery store, restaurant or gas station,” Kemper said. “Recently, on a delayed and then canceled flight from Lambert to LaGuardia, I was at baggage claim trying to track down my suitcase and son’s stroller. The couple ahead of me, three children in tow, told me to go ahead of them. ‘We’re fine,’ they told me. ‘We live here.’”“Not everyone is nice, of course,” she said. “But most people are.”"

After the project racked up millions of views in a video Babble and Disney (Babble’s parent company) shared on social media, Karen Marie knew she wanted to quickly start her next series of baby princess photos. For the new project, she imagined six more babies as Pocahontas, Elena from “Elena of Avalor,” Tiana from “The Princess and the Frog,” Rapunzel from “Tangled,” Mulan and Moana. Karen Marie, a mom of three who has specialized in maternity and newborn photography for 11 years, told HuffPost that “so many moments” stood out during the shoot at her studio in Roseville, California. The photographer especially loved that the backdrop for the Moana photo is an actual photo of the Waipio Valley on the Big Island in Hawaii.“A good friend sent it over for me to print and use,” she said. “It was perfect! Seeing all the sets and babies put together is always a wonderful feeling.”Like the last project, this photo shoot included outfits from Sew Trendy Accessories and props and sets designed by Karen Marie and her team. Wooley Dreams on Etsy provided the cute stuffed animal props. Karen Marie already knows what she wants for her next Disney-themed shoot, which will stray a bit beyond the princess boundaries. She will photograph more babies as Elsa and Anna from “Frozen,” Merida from “Brave,” Princess Leia from the “Star Wars” franchise and Alice from “Alice in Wonderland.”After the success of the first Disney princess project, Karen Marie was nervous about following it up, but is happy with what she and her team pulled off. “I put a lot of pressure on myself to make sure this set of princesses lived up to the first ones I did,” she told HuffPost. “I think I was pretty successful.

A rainbow baby is a child born after a miscarriage, stillbirth, neonatal death or infant loss. Photographer Lindsey Worthington captured six mothers who have experienced this kind of loss and found joy in the form of a rainbow baby. “I wanted to bring together mothers that had the same experiences and spread hope to those who are going through the same thing,” Worthington told HuffPost. “It’s taboo that nobody ever talks about it but a third of women will experience a miscarriage in their lives. I don’t want other women to feel so alone and spread hope.”The photographer found participants by posting a model call on Facebook. She used non-toxic colored powder made from rice flour and corn starch to create the rainbow effect. “The moms and kids had so much fun playing with it and creating the image,” Worthington said. “We had to take around five shots to get the perfect one!” The photographer shared some pictures from the shoot on her Facebook page, along with some quotes from the mothers she photographed. Her post was shared over 100 times, and the comments section is filled with emotional responses. Though Worthington is not a parent herself, she said she wants to shatter the stigma around discussing this sort of loss among parents and bring comfort to women who have been there. “I really hope that people see that miscarriages are common and that there is hope. The silence about the topic is almost deafening, and I don’t want women to feel like they’re alone,” she said.“We came together to spread joy, and it was so comforting,” she added. “It was an incredible feeling to unite through grief and heartbreak but to also be so full of happiness and hope.”H/T The Stir"

Hundreds — if not thousands — of Rohingya are believed to have died in clashes between the Myanmar army and the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, a militant group.Refugees have accused the Myanmar military of indiscriminately killing civilians, including children; razing entire villages; and committing rape and torture. “Everything ... destroyed by the military,” a Rohingya refugee named Mohammed Harun told CNN. “Genocide is going on there.”Suu Kyi has yet to react publicly on the latest violence in Rakhine state, reported Channel NewsAsia on Monday. Her government, however, has previously blocked attempts by the United Nations to investigate allegations of the Myanmar army committing human rights violations in Rakhine state. “Daw Aung San Suu Kyi said we would not coordinate with the U.N. fact-finding mission as we have disassociated ourselves from the resolution because we do not think that the resolution is in keeping with what is actually happening on the ground,” said an official in June, according to Radio Free Asia. Suu Kyi’s government, which does not recognize the Rohingya as an ethnic group of Myanmar, has blamed the violence in Rakhine on “extremist terrorists.” In an op-ed published Friday, the editorial board of The Washington Post reminded Suu Kyi of her Nobel lecture in 2012, in which she urged the world not to forget those who are suffering. “Wherever suffering is ignored, there will be the seeds of conflict, for suffering degrades and embitters and enrages,” she said then. “When will Aung San Suu Kyi speak out” for the suffering of the Rohingya, the editorial questioned.

The money would replenish FEMA coffers so that it can continue to respond to Harvey and meet the immediate needs of other crises that may arise. The other $450 million would go to the Small Business Administration’s disaster loan program, designed to help individuals and small businesses begin rebuilding their homes.While the package almost certainly won’t be the last funding legislation responding to the damage caused by Harvey in southeastern Texas, it could complicate other urgent matters facing Congress. Government funding runs until Sept. 30, close to the time that the government’s borrowing authority expires. A leading option for congressional leaders has to address both issues in a bill to extend funding until mid-December through a so-called continuing resolution and raise the debt ceiling for some yet-to-be-determined period.Although such legislation may not naturally be too popular among Republicans ― especially if it doesn’t fund President Donald Trump’s border wall and does fund certain Obamacare payments to win over Democrats ― GOP leaders had believed the inclusion of Harvey aid could be enough to get many of their party members to support the bill.A second round of disaster relief ― tightly focused to the specific needs of southeastern Texas ― still could be part of a continuing resolution/debt ceiling measure. But there’s also the chance that acting this week of partial Harvey-related aid will remove some of the motivation for conservatives to grudgingly back a spending/debt ceiling deal.The conservatives could more reasonably argue that they showed their support for Harvey aid at the beginning of the month, but that they do not back raising the debt ceiling without structural spending reforms or funding the government if Trump doesn’t get money to build his wall.In August, Trump told a rally in Phoenix that he was getting funding for that wall even “if we have to close down our government.” That sort of condition could be a real problem for GOP leaders, as Democrats seem to have no intention of giving in to Trump’s demands and are reasonably confident that the public would blame Republicans for a shutdown. Again, GOP leaders may still intend to attach a larger Harvey aid package in the final version of a continuing resolution/debt ceiling bill. They can still argue that Harvey aid is a key win for Congress, and that voting ‘no’ would come with the political backlash of ignoring a devastated community. But letting lawmakers vote on the initial Harvey aid package first, tempering any immediate criticism that they’re heartless, could prove to be a political misstep, even as the GOP leaders try to do the right thing."

The cause of death was not disclosed.Ashbery, who was first associated with the New York school of poetry in the 1950s and 1960s, won the Pulitzer Prize for “Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror” in 1976. The collection won the National Book Award and the National Book Circle Critics Award the same year.Ashbery was deeply influenced by abstract expressionist art and early in his career was an art critic. He tried to capture the experience of disorder in his poems, with experience slipping away from the process of understanding.“I would like to please the reader, and I think that surprise has to be an element of this, and that may necessitate a certain amount of teasing,” he said in a 1983 Paris Review interview.Ashbery was born in Rochester, New York, the son of a biology teacher and a farmer, and wrote his first poem at 8. He graduated from Harvard University and went to France as a Fulbright Scholar in the 1950s.He was awarded the National Humanities Medal in 2011 by President Barack Obama, who praised him for profoundly influencing generations of writers."

But that doesn't mean the oil is going away.,2017-09-04,"Offshore wind is soaring in Europe and East Asia, though it has been slow to take off in the United States.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59ad86581700001f0028825e.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"REYKJAVIK, Iceland ― Denmark’s biggest company is selling off the country’s last oil firm as the world’s top wind turbine-producing nation transitions to renewable energy. Last month, A.P. Moller-Maersk, the famed industrial and shipping conglomerate, agreed to sell its oil and gas division to French giant Total. Pending regulatory approval, the $7.45 billion deal is expected to close by next year, Bloomberg reported.The move comes three months after Dong Energy, the Danish firm that’s spearheading offshore wind development in the United States and across Europe, sold its oil and gas business to a German buyer for $1.3 billion.The Nordic nation still needs revenues from its North Sea oil fields to fund its transition to clean energy, and Total promised to do so. But Denmark has pledged to completely wean itself off fossil fuels by 2050.“By selling to Total, we ensure a continued Danish stronghold in the North Sea based on Maersk Oil’s leading position within technology development and its track record as a lean, efficient and trusted partner,” Claus V. Hemmingsen, Maersk’s vice chief executive, said in a statement. “Importantly, Maersk Oil will remain close to its technology and innovation partners at the Danish technical institutions and in the oil and gas service industry to the benefit of all parties.”Scandinavian countries are taking aggressive steps to reduce carbon emissions from their electricity sectors, despite some nations’ long reliance on fossil fuel revenues. Sweden produced 57 percent of its power from renewables in 2015, and aims to bring that number to 100 percent by 2040. Norway, whose state-owned Statoil fuels a massive sovereign wealth fund, is investing heavily in offshore wind, including off the coast of New York. Iceland, a volcanic island with plentiful water resources, gets 100 percent of its energy from geothermal and hydropower.Yet revenues from the North Sea oil help finance around 1 gigawatt of new offshore wind infrastructure each year, according to data from a recent deal in Norway cited by Bloomberg Intelligence. That’s equal to the power used by about 170,000 homes. Offshore wind is soaring in Europe. The industry will provide 17,575 megawatts worldwide this year, with 14,740 megawatts in Europe and 2,805 in Asia, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance data provided to HuffPost. But it has failed to take off in North America, where a meager 30 megawatts come from a tiny, five-turbine operation off the coast of Block Island. The U.S. generates about 15 percent of its electricity from renewable energy, relying instead on natural gas and coal. Just 5.6 percent of that came from wind. Offshore wind, however, holds vast promise for the country. Wind blows so strongly and reliably off U.S. coasts that it could generate 4,223 gigawatts of electricity ― four times the power that’s currently produced by all sources in the country, according to a 2012 study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.CLARIFICATION: The headline and some language in this article was updated to make clear that Maersk is a private company.

He later suffered a second seizure at the hospital and is now resting following the medical ordeal, the website added. A representative for the Grammy-winning rapper confirmed to TMZ that Lil Wayne, 34, had suffered “multiple seizures.” A Las Vegas show, which he had been scheduled to perform late Sunday night, was canceled, the rep added.Drai’s Beachclub Nightclub confirmed the cancellation on its Facebook page on Sunday night.“Our priority is the health and well-being of our artists. Everyone at Drai’s wishes Lil Wayne a speedy recovery during this time,” the club wrote.Lil Wayne, whose real name is Dwayne Michael Carter Jr., has been hospitalized in the past for seizures. In 2016, his private jet had to make an emergency landing during a cross-country flight after he suffered multiple seizures in the air. In 2013, he was admitted to an intensive care unit in Los Angeles after enduring what the rapper later described as life-threatening seizures. In an interview with LA radio station Power 106 following the 2013 health scare, the rapper revealed he had epilepsy and was “prone to seizures.”“Like, this isn’t my first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh seizure. I’ve had a bunch of seizures, y’all just never hear about them,” he said. “But this time it got real bad ’cause I had three of them in a row and on the third one, my heart rate went down to like 30 percent. Basically, I could’ve died, so that is why it was so serious. But the reason being for the seizures is just plain stress, no rest, overworking myself.”Last year, Lil Wayne said he takes medication to control the neurological condition.The rapper is next scheduled to perform on Sept.17 at the Paid Dues Festival in LA."

He just knows why ― to save horses.Over the past few days, he and other veterinarians, veterinary assistants and volunteers converged at this sports and entertainment complex built to host concerts, sporting events and fairs.Since Hurricane Harvey hit Texas, Ford Park has become something quite different. It is currently a makeshift animal triage hospital, where Moore estimates 150 to 160 horses have been treated ― many ravaged by hypothermia, fever, respiratory infections and stress-induced colic.“A lot of these horses had to paddle in water or stand in water for anywhere from multiple hours to days,” the Georgetown, Texas, vet told HuffPost on Sunday.When owners started bringing animals here ― simply because Ford Park was one of the few places in the area that could accommodate them ― people who cared started showing up, without any formal organization.“This is all volunteers,” Moore said. “I ended up here by accident. There were people desperate for help.”“At first it was just chaos and we were short on supplies,” he added. “And all of a sudden people started pouring in from everywhere. We had teenage girls that drove in from Kentucky, people from Florida, veterinarians from Wisconsin. ... And you can see the amount of the supplies that have been donated.” It was hard to witness the shape some of the animals were in as they arrived. Many were emaciated, severely dehydrated and had skin conditions, after being stranded in dirty, toxic water.“Their skin was literally falling off,” Maggie Olthaus, a veterinary technician at Bella Vista Equine in Blacklick, Ohio, said of some of the horses she treated.Like Moore, Olthaus found it hard to explain how she ended up in Ford Park.“We came to work on Wednesday with a full schedule of our normal day planned out. Around 7 a.m. we all decided we needed to come and help out. We put the post out on Facebook on our page asking for donations so that we could start packing things and getting ready to leave, and the public outreach we received … it was so incredible.”“We started out with two trailers filled with hay, $3,500 of donated medical supplies and equipment donated by MWI Veterinary Supply, a company we do business with,” Olthaus said.In the days since, she said, her group has raised more than $20,000. “We have multiple semis headed down here hauling hundreds of bales of hay and tons of grain,” along with other supplies, she said. “Overnight, things have gotten very organized.”IV bags were still hanging from many of the remaining horses on Sunday afternoon. The ones that need more care are being stabilized, so they can be transferred to Texas A&M University and another large animal clinic for further treatment.“Between all the vets that showed up, all the volunteers, and all the supplies, we basically saved 150, 160 horses,” Moore said. “We only lost four horses, which is pretty much miraculous considering the shape they were coming in.”Harley, a 7-year-old quarterhorse, is among those heading to Texas A&M, where she will be treated for a fever and possibly pneumonia.“I got her at 8 months. She is my baby,” said Jamie Sander, a 33-year-old woman who was born in Austin and now lives in Colorado.Haley was one of three horses that Jamie and her sister, Cristina Coots, were planning to take to Colorado.Floodwater at the facility where the horses were being held was knee-deep in one area and muddy everywhere else.“They were good until the wind got really bad, and then they were anxious with each other, just kicking and biting,” Coots said. “Our 2-year-old stud has bites all over him. We know it’s from her and the other horse.”Coots, a 43-year-old mother of five, said the hurricane has given her a new perspective, despite all she has seen at Ford Park and elsewhere in Texas.“I feel fortunate because this is the most we lost. We didn’t lose everything, and we pray for the people who did. Because I’ve seen a lot of the devastation and it’s bad, and it’s hard to explain to my kids.”"

There were people desperate for help.”“At first it was just chaos and we were short on supplies,” he added. “And all of a sudden people started pouring in from everywhere. We had teenage girls that drove in from Kentucky, people from Florida, veterinarians from Wisconsin. ... And you can see the amount of the supplies that have been donated.” It was hard to witness the shape some of the animals were in as they arrived. Many were emaciated, severely dehydrated and had skin conditions, after being stranded in dirty, toxic water.“Their skin was literally falling off,” Maggie Olthaus, a veterinary technician at Bella Vista Equine in Blacklick, Ohio, said of some of the horses she treated.Like Moore, Olthaus found it hard to explain how she ended up in Ford Park.“We came to work on Wednesday with a full schedule of our normal day planned out. Around 7 a.m. we all decided we needed to come and help out. We put the post out on Facebook on our page asking for donations so that we could start packing things and getting ready to leave, and the public outreach we received … it was so incredible.”“We started out with two trailers filled with hay, $3,500 of donated medical supplies and equipment donated by MWI Veterinary Supply, a company we do business with,” Olthaus said.In the days since, she said, her group has raised more than $20,000. “We have multiple semis headed down here hauling hundreds of bales of hay and tons of grain,” along with other supplies, she said. “Overnight, things have gotten very organized.”IV bags were still hanging from many of the remaining horses on Sunday afternoon. The ones that need more care are being stabilized, so they can be transferred to Texas A&M University and another large animal clinic for further treatment.“Between all the vets that showed up, all the volunteers, and all the supplies, we basically saved 150, 160 horses,” Moore said. “We only lost four horses, which is pretty much miraculous considering the shape they were coming in.”Harley, a 7-year-old quarterhorse, is among those heading to Texas A&M, where she will be treated for a fever and possibly pneumonia.“I got her at 8 months. She is my baby,” said Jamie Sander, a 33-year-old woman who was born in Austin and now lives in Colorado.Haley was one of three horses that Jamie and her sister, Cristina Coots, were planning to take to Colorado.Floodwater at the facility where the horses were being held was knee-deep in one area and muddy everywhere else.“They were good until the wind got really bad, and then they were anxious with each other, just kicking and biting,” Coots said. “Our 2-year-old stud has bites all over him. We know it’s from her and the other horse.”Coots, a 43-year-old mother of five, said the hurricane has given her a new perspective, despite all she has seen at Ford Park and elsewhere in Texas.“I feel fortunate because this is the most we lost. We didn’t lose everything, and we pray for the people who did. Because I’ve seen a lot of the devastation and it’s bad, and it’s hard to explain to my kids.”"

Why? She’s getting booed while attending her best friend’s wedding. Amid one of the craziest weeks of her career, the pop star took a break from stirring internet frenzy to be a bridesmaid at the wedding of high school bestie Abigail Anderson.For those who haven’t dedicated every waking moment to deciphering Swift’s lyrics, Abigail is the redheaded girl she sings about in “Fifteen.” Remember? The one who “gave everything she had to a boy who changed his mind.” Well, hopefully Swift left that part out of her bridesmaid’s speech, but she did look ever-dutiful on Saturday carrying Anderson’s veil before entering Old Whaling Church in Edgartown, Martha’s Vineyard. Dressing very much like the old Taylor, the “Ready For It” singer wore a maroon floor-length halter gown with a sweetheart neckline. She paired the look with a bold red lip and a pendant necklace. Given how everything Swift does these days is shrouded in secrecy, of course, die-hard Swifties jumped at the opportunity to catch a glimpse of their idol, and waited all afternoon. But when their moment of glory came, bodyguards erected a makeshift screen to shield Swift from her adoring public and some paparazzi, as she exited the church and hopped in an SUV. That’s when the crowd’s temperament soured and the booing began.“Taylor, we love you!” someone shouted. “We thought you loved your fans!”“Very disappointing, not cool,” another fan chimed in.Can we all just give the girl a break? Watch the video above. Correction: This story previously stated that it was raining the day of the wedding, but, according to weather reports, it wasn’t. Taylor Swift did apparently use umbrellas to hide herself from fans, though. "

KCNA via REUTERS",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59ab81e91400002000fa7c4d.jpeg?cache=EMfbqsbgme&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"SEOUL, Sept 3 (Reuters) - A shallow, 6.3 magnitude earthquake shook North Korea on Sunday, suggesting it had detonated a sixth nuclear device, hours after it said it had developed an advanced hydrogen bomb that possesses “great destructive power.”The earthquake struck 75 km (45 miles) north northwest of Kimchaek. Previous recent tremors in the region have been caused by nuclear tests, which if the case this time round, is bound to increase the tension hours after U.S. President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe talked by phone about the “escalating” nuclear crisis.The quake was only 10 km deep, the U.S. Geological Survey said, again suggesting a nuclear device.Witnesses in the Chinese city of Yanji, on the border with North Korea, said they felt a tremor that lasted roughly 10 seconds, followed by an aftershock.The hydrogen bomb report by North Korea’s official KCNA newsagency comes amid heightened regional tension following Pyongyang’s two tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) in July that potentially could fly about 10,000 km (6,200 miles), putting many parts of the mainland United States within range.Under third-generation leader Kim Jong Un, North Korea has been pursuing a nuclear device small and light enough to fit on a long-range ballistic missile, without affecting its range and making it capable of surviving re-entry into the Earth’s atmosphere.North Korea, which carries out its nuclear and missile programs in defiance of UN Security Council resolutions and sanctions, “recently succeeded” in making a more advanced hydrogen bomb that will be loaded on to an ICBM, KCNA said.“The H-bomb, the explosive power of which is adjustable from tens kiloton to hundreds kiloton, is a multi-functional thermonuclear nuke with great destructive power which can be detonated even at high altitudes for super-powerful EMP (electromagnetic pulse) attack according to strategic goals,” KCNA said.“All components of the H-bomb were homemade and all the processes ... were put on the Juche basis, thus enabling the country to produce powerful nuclear weapons as many as it wants,” KCNA quoted Kim as saying.Juche is North Korea’s homegrown ideology of self-reliance that is a mix of Marxism and extreme nationalism preached by state founder Kim Il Sung, the current leader’s grandfather. It says its weapons programs are needed to counter U.S. aggression.North Korea offered no evidence for its latest claim, and Kim Dong-yub, a military expert at Kyungnam University’s Institute of Far Eastern Studies in Seoul, was skeptical.“Referring to tens to hundreds of kilotons, it doesn’t appear to be talking about a fully fledged H-bomb. It’s more likely a boosted nuclear device,” Kim said, referring to an atomic bomb which uses some hydrogen isotopes to boost explosive yield.A hydrogen bomb can achieve thousands of kilotons of explosive yield - massively more powerful than some 10 to 15 kilotons that North Korea’s last nuclear test in September was estimated to have produced, similar to the bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, in 1945. HOURGLASS-SHAPED DEVICEKim Jong Un, who visited the country’s nuclear weapons institute, “watched an H-bomb to be loaded into new ICBM” and “set forth tasks to be fulfilled in the research into nukes,” KCNA said.Pictures released by the agency showed Kim inspecting a silver-colored, hourglass-shaped warhead in the visit accompanied by nuclear scientists, with a concept diagram of its Hwasong-14 long-range ballistic missile seen hanging on the wall.The shape shows a marked difference from pictures of the ball-shaped device North Korea released in March last year, and appears to indicate the appearance of a two-stage thermonuclear weapon, or a hydrogen bomb, said Lee Choon-geun, senior research fellow at state-run Science and Technology Policy Institute.“The pictures show a more complete form of a possible hydrogen bomb, with a primary fission bomb and a secondary fusion stage connected together in an hourglass shape,” Lee said.Tensions on the Korean peninsula have been high since last month when North Korea threatened to launch missiles into the sea near the strategically located U.S. Pacific territory of Guam after Trump said Pyongyang would face “fire and fury” if it threatened the United States.North Korea further raised regional tensions on Tuesday by launching an intermediate-range ballistic missile over Japan, drawing international condemnation.Trump and Abe spoke by phone and said that in face of an “escalating” situation with North Korea that close cooperation between their countries and with South Korea was needed, Abe told reporters.Trump told Abe that the United States, as an ally, was 100 percent with Japan, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasutoshi Nishimura told reporters.“The two leaders reaffirmed the importance of close cooperation between the United States, Japan and South Korea in the face of the growing threat from North Korea,” the White House said in a statement. “President Trump noted that he looks forward to continued trilateral coordination on the margins of the United Nations General Assembly.”The United States has repeatedly urged China, the North’s sole major ally, to do more to rein in its neighbor.North Korea last year conducted its fourth and fifth nuclear tests, saying the fourth in January 2016 was a successful hydrogen bomb test, although outside experts say the claim has not been proved.Impoverished North Korea and the rich, democratic South are technically still at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. The North regularly threatens to destroy the South and its main ally, the United States.(Additional reporting by Elaine Lies and Kiyoshi Takenaka in Tokyo, Jane Chung and Yuna Park in Seoul, Sue-Lin Wong in Yanji and Steve Holland in Washington, Editing by Will Dunham, Nick Macfie and Himani Sarkar) "

North Korean state television described the nuclear test as a “perfect success.” Analysts have expressed skepticism about the claims of an H-bomb ― a device far more powerful than the atomic bombs that devastated Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 ― but the international community expressed “grave concern” at the apparent advancement in North Korea’s nuclear capabilities. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the nuclear test caused a shallow magnitude 6.3 earthquake. A South Korean official told The New York Times this meant the explosion was at least “five to six times” more powerful than North Korea’s previous nuclear test, which took place last September. In a series of tweets posted a few hours after the detonation, U.S. President Donald Trump called North Korea a “rogue nation” that continues “to be very hostile and dangerous to the United States.Trump, who previously threatened North Korea with “fire and fury,” went on to say that South Korea’s “talk of appeasement” is not working. “They only understand one thing” he said, without elaborating.“We’ll see,” Trump said later on Sunday when a reporter asked the president as he was returning from church if he planned to attack North Korea.Trump convened a meeting of national security officials at the White House and afterward Defense Secretary warned that any attack on the U.S. or its allies would be met by “a massive military response.” He said the response would be “both effective and overwhelming.”“We have many military options” he told reporters outside the White House, and Trump was briefed on them.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un “should take heed of the United Nations Security Council’s unified voice,” Mattis said. “All members unanimously agreed on the threat North Korea poses, and they remain unanimous in their commitment to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, because we are not looking to the total annihilation of a country, namely North Korea. But as I said, we have many options to do so.”Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., said on Twitter that she had called for an emergency meeting of the security council on Monday morning.Trump also tweeted on Sunday that he was considering “stopping all trade with any country doing business with North Korea.”U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin told Fox News on Sunday that he would put together new sanctions against Pyongyang aimed at cutting off all trade.North Korea’s nuclear test comes amid uncertainty surrounding the free trade deal between South Korea and the U.S., which Trump has criticized.Trump said on Saturday that he would be mulling over the fate of the U.S-Korea Free Trade Agreement in the coming days. Axios reported that the president was “seriously considering withdrawing” from the deal.In the immediate aftermath of Sunday’s nuclear test, Washington conducted emergency calls with allies Japan and South Korea.U.S. National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster spoke with his South Korean counterpart, Chung Eui-yong, for 20 minutes about an hour after the blast, according to the Associated Press. Seoul has called for the “strongest possible” response from the international community, including new sanctions to “completely isolate” its northern neighbor, the BBC reported.China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement that it “resolutely opposes” the nuclear test, while the Russian foreign ministry said North Korea’s blatant disregard of international law deserved “the strongest condemnation.”German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron said they intend to tighten European Union sanctions on North Korea, and British Prime Minister Theresa May said the UN Security Council should consider new measures, Reuters reported. Yukiya Amano, head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog, called North Korea’s nuclear program “a matter of grave concern.” “This new test, which follows the two tests last year and is the sixth [by North Korea] since 2006, is in complete disregard of the repeated demands of the international community,” said Amano, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency.The test occurred mere hours after North Korean media reported Pyongyang had developed a hydrogen bomb that could be carried by an intercontinental ballistic missile ― a munition system that could possibly reach the U.S. mainland. Images had been circulated of Kim inspecting an hourglass-shaped warhead.Though analysts said Sunday that they doubt North Korea has truly developed a hydrogen bomb, experts said the country’s nuclear capabilities were evidently improving. Kim Dong-yub, a defense analyst in Seoul, told The New York Times he believed the test on Sunday involved a “boosted” atomic bomb. Nuclear weapons expert David Albright told the paper the power of the device suggested it contained “thermonuclear material.” Vipin Narang, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor who specializes in nuclear strategy, described the weapon tested as a “city buster.” “Now, with even relatively inaccurate intercontinental ballistic missile technology, [North Korea] can destroy the better part of a city with this yield,” Narang told The Washington Post.Sunday’s test is the latest in a series of recent provocations by North Korea. It fired a missile over Japan in late August, causing the Japanese government to urge citizens in the missile’s path to take shelter. Tokyo harshly condemned that launch, the first time since 2009 that a North Korean projectile has taken a path over Japan.That incident also prompted Trump, as he had done before, to suggest an American military response as a possible option.North Korea and the U.S. have long been in an intractable diplomatic standoff, but the relationship has deteriorated this year as Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs rapidly advance.The situation intensified in early August, after the Post reported that North Korea had successfully miniaturized a nuclear warhead, a key step toward being able to fire a nuclear weapon that could reach the U.S. mainland.Since then, Trump and North Korea have exchanged heated rhetoric, and the U.N. has moved to put stricter sanctions on Pyongyang. Trump made his “fire and fury” threat in early August and tweeted that “talking is not the answer!” Other White House officials, including Mattis, subsequently tried to walk back his statements.North Korea has reacted to Trump’s remarks and the international condemnation directed at it by repeatedly threatening the U.S. island territory of Guam. In response, Mattis has said that any missile headed toward the island would be shot down.The U.S. and its allies have several missile defense systems in place around the region, and the U.S. military has been testing its missile defenses in response to North Korea’s increasingly brazen launches.On Aug. 30, U.S. military officials announced they had successfully shot down a intermediate-range ballistic missile during a test at a base in Hawaii ― the same type of missile that North Korea had fired over Japan days earlier. This article has been updated with comments from U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. "

But since becoming president, Trump has taken a number of actions that have the potential to undermine the exchanges, increase premiums and reduce the number of people who get covered.The open enrollment period for 2018 coverage starts Nov. 1 and runs until Dec. 15. There’s still time for the Trump administration to take the necessary steps to ensure that the millions of people who get their private health insurance from the exchange marketplaces, which include HealthCare.gov and Covered California, have a positive experience and obtain the coverage they want. But the evidence to date doesn’t suggest Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price actually want the next sign-up period to go smoothly, and the president has openly rooted for the exchanges to fail. The Department of Health and Human Services has used the websites and social media platforms that were created to promote enrollment instead to criticize the law.The Trump administration canceled advertisements at the end of the last open enrollment season, contributing to a decline in the number of people who signed up compared with 2016. The Department of Health and Human Services has cut the length of the open enrollment period in half, to six weeks, compared with last year. The administration has canceled contracts with some local groups that proved crucial to spreading the word about coverage options and helping people sign up for policies, and plans to slash funding for other enrollment assistance programs by almost 40 percent. The administration is also severely reducing its budget for promotions and advertising, from $100 million last year to $10 million this time.Trump has suggested his administration won’t fully enforce the law’s individual mandate that most Americans get health coverage or face tax penalties, which could encourage healthier people to go without insurance and deprive the exchange markets of the premiums they would have paid. Trump repeatedly threatens to withhold money the federal government owes insurers for reducing cost-sharing burdens, such as deductibles, for the poorest Obamacare enrollees, leading the insurers to raise rates even more. To get a better understanding of where things stand and what might happen this fall when Americans return to the health insurance exchanges, HuffPost interviewed Andy Slavitt, who oversaw these marketplaces as head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services during the Obama administration. The following is a transcript of that conversation, which took place before the Trump administration announced significant cuts to promotions, advertising and enrollment assistance. It has been edited for length and clarity.What does it take to have a successful open enrollment period on the Affordable Care Act’s health insurance exchange marketplaces?So there’s three things you want to get right. You want to get the technology capable of scaling to meet the demand, which means you have to have some understanding of what the demand is. You need to have your operations working, which means that all of the policy changes that have been made throughout the year have to be implemented well on the website, have to be implemented well on the call center, and you need enough call center capacity. And third, you need your outreach machine working well, which means that you are beginning to notify people of changes they need to be aware of. For example, if they’ve had a plan change because there’s a new plan in their market or their plan no longer exists, they’ve got an IRS issue that you want to make them aware of, you want to make sure they’re aware of the new dates for open enrollment because they’ve changed, and that you’ve engaged local assisters and in-person help. And then, finally, that you’ve done the marketing outreach. We would have very specific marketing deliverables already done and in the bag. Today, I don’t think they are even underway yet.Based on what we know, what steps has the Trump administration taken to prepare for the 2018 open enrollment period? What haven’t they done yet?We don’t know what they’ve done as it relates to technology, to start with, but our hope would be that they’re planning for much bigger volume days than we’ve had in the past because they’ve cut the open enrollment season in half. From an operations standpoint, unfortunately, we do know that they have closed two call centers ― I assume that’s about 800 people ― which is going to have an impact on the ability to service the operation and service people and service people timely. What we don’t know is how many people across all the call centers will be staffed, and one would hope that they’re going to manage that also to a very high peak. That’s a concern. And then third, from an outreach standpoint, I think one would hope that they are buying ad time, that they are starting to get emails out and that they would be engaged with their network of local assistors and local help. News reports suggest that they have canceled contracts and have not engaged at the local level yet. So that’s the picture we have at this point.There are two types of people, right? There are people that have policies that are renewing and you can sub-segment them into different categories: people who have no changes, people whose current plan’s no longer available, people who will be auto-enrolled into a different plan, people who wouldn’t be auto-enrolled into a different plan. And they need a fair amount of effort and hand-holding and outreach and communication, just to renew folks. And the first thing to be concerned about is that it takes a lot of effort to explain to people what their choices are as they renew. I think that’s the first step.The second step is people who are going to enroll but have never enrolled in the exchanges before. Those are typically going to be people who need to be informed and educated because they are probably not aware that there are affordable options available to them or what their tax credit subsidies are. We launched in the past important tools like window shopping [for health insurance policies], and we have done a lot of outreach and hired celebrities and had people in local communities and done all kinds of things to try to reach people. We do know that when they have awareness of how affordable it is to enroll, that you get a lot of people that enroll. So it’s a pretty big payoff for the marketing and outreach efforts, and I think in that area we’ve got reason to be pessimistic based on all the actions we’ve seen so far. Whether they’ve cut that back severely or whether they’re going to cut it back entirely, one doesn’t know, but that’s going to have an impact on being able to reach new people.How would you characterize the state of the health insurance exchanges at the end of the Obama administration?2015 and 2016 were years when the exchanges were underpriced [customers used more medical care than the insurers expected when they set prices], and so 2017 was the year of some necessary rate increases. While those were painful for some people, the good news is that put the exchanges in the position of stability. The exchanges are on relatively solid ground now. I think there are four or five states that are smaller, that are rural. I think those are states that have historically suffered from competition problems. But, by and large, many of the states are competitive and in as healthy a position as they’ve been in for a while. How do you differentiate between problems on the exchanges that remain from the previous administration and what we’re seeing now?I’ll say this: States that want to make the ACA succeed and set up the ACA, they’re doing a lot better. So if you’re in a state that’s expanded Medicaid and if you’re in a state that has its own state-based exchange, generally speaking you have much lower rates and you have many more competitors. If you’re a state that folded your arms and said, “I want no part of this. I’m going to let the federal government do everything, and I’m not going to expand Medicaid,” then you have a very different situation. Your rates are going to be higher, you’re going to have fewer competitors and it’s just not going to feel like an environment where insurers want to compete. For one, even before you look at the attitude change at the federal government level, states have set their own course. The Republican states are not the ones that have taken advantage of those things, by and large, and the states that have really taken the bull by the horns initially, I think they’re having better outcomes. That’s the first part. The second part is that, this year, you can measure the impact on rates from actions the Trump administration has specifically chosen to take. Really, even if you just limit it to two actions: the decision to not enforce the individual mandate vigorously or leave it very ambivalent, and then the not making a commitment to pay for cost-sharing reductions. You know, those things have been estimated by the Congressional Budget Office, and certainly backed up by other independent analysts, as as much as half to two-thirds of all the rate increases. Not to say that there aren’t the normal fluctuations and ups and downs of markets ― because, you know, markets aren’t perfect, the ACA is a private market solution, so it’s going to suffer from imperfections that are in markets. But when you add on top of those normal imperfections the self-inflicted wounds of as much as 30 percent additional premiums, that’s the stuff you can point to the Trump administration and say, “Hey, we didn’t need to have that. We can get rid of that.”Why does the federal government need to do any of this? Why can’t people who need health insurance take care of it themselves? And why can’t we rely on health insurance companies to market and promote their own products, like companies in other markets do?Well, look, I think it’s a little bit of everybody’s job. But an important part of this question is: Why is it in the federal government’s best interest to focus on outreach and marketing? And I’ll give you a few reasons. The first one is because the ACA is funded by user fees [paid by health insurance companies]. These are funds that are intended to be used to make the marketplace work. The way to keep the market functioning and healthy is to continually get new young, healthy people to enroll. And if you don’t, you risk prices going up. And when prices go up, subsidies that the federal government pays go up. So it’s a very wise investment from the federal government to invest in things that are going to reduce outlays. That’s the second reason. And the third reason is ― just like any other government program, like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid ― informing people of their rights and their benefits and making a process simple and easy for them is the role of the federal government, to a certain extent. So providing in-person assistance, language assistance for people who don’t speak English as their first language, and all of those things ― it’s all part and parcel of providing a benefit.What should health insurance consumers who use the marketplaces expect, what do they need to know and how should they get ready to shop around and choose policies for next year?I think the good news is that there’s going to be many more options and many more affordable options for more people than probably ever before. So I think the challenge is that people who listen to the media or only pay passing attention, they may think the ACA’s been repealed, they may think ― if they listen to the words of the president ― that it’s exploding, or they may believe that there aren’t very many options available. Well, the reality is, for most Americans who buy insurance through the exchange, their subsidies, their tax credits give them access to very likely even more affordable coverage than prior years, that there are sufficient options in most locations, that most Americans live in areas where there is a lot of competition. So the news is actually quite good for people if they are able to get past some of the rhetoric that’s out there. Now, there’s obviously variation around this, and I think particularly for people in rural areas, the picture’s not as good. And in some small states, there are some challenges that don’t exist in some of the bigger states. Hopefully, the administration or the Congress will resolve the cost-sharing reduction payment issue, and, if they do, then I think we’ll see more affordable rates. If they don’t, then sadly people will be asked to pay more than they need to because of an administration policy.What’s your prediction of how open enrollment will turn out for 2018? Is it already too late for there to be a successful open enrollment period?It’s not too late. I mean, I think if the administration decided to take ownership of open enrollment and aim for it to be successful, I’m quite confident that they can. The investments are modest. It’s just a matter of deciding to do a good job versus deciding not to care. But all the pieces are in place for that to happen. The good news is people want to be insured, so you’re not doing something that is an unnatural act. If they simply decide that they want to achieve a goal of covering more Americans, I’m quite confident that they have the staff, the resources, the process and the technology to do that. So if we have anything less than that, I think it will be a choice that they will have made to say that that’s not an important goal."

There’s nothing nice about it. It’s just hard.”Jolie and Pitt, a former Hollywood power couple, met in on the set of “Mr. & Mrs. Smith,” and were together for 12 years and married for two. The couple split in September 2016, and Jolie’s life since has been physically and emotionally taxing.“Sometimes maybe it appears I am pulling it all together, but really I am just trying to get through my days.”“Emotionally, it’s been a very difficult year,” she added. “I have had some other health issues. So my health is something I have to monitor.”In 2013, Jolie had a preventive double mastectomy and in 2015, she had her ovaries removed. Last year, around the time of her breakup, she also developed hypertension and Bell’s palsy, which causes a drooping in the face, due to damaged facial nerves.Yet, the mother of six told the Sunday Telegraph that despite it all, she is trying to stay positive.“I feel sometimes that my body has taken a hit, but I try to laugh as much as possible,” she said. “We tend to get so stressed that our children feel our stress when they need to feel our joy. Even if you are going through chemo, you need to find the ability to love and laugh. It may sound like a postcard, but it’s true.”"

REUTERS/Federico Rios",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59ab37391700001f00287fa6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NORTHWESTERN JUNGLES, Colombia, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Colombia’s ELN guerrilla group said a Russian-Armenian citizen it held hostage for six months was killed in April while trying to escape, a startling admission that risks throwing current peace talks with the government into jeopardy.In a rare interview, a commander of the National Liberation Army, Colombia’s last active guerrilla group, said that ransoms from kidnappings were necessary to keep its fighters in the field and that peace would be impossible without state funding to feed and clothe the rebels.The ELN seized Arsen Voskanyan in November. The group claimed that he was collecting endangered, poisonous frogs in the jungles of the northwestern department of Choco and accused him of wanting to smuggle wildlife overseas.After his lengthy captivity, Voskanyan was shot when he grabbed a hand grenade in a bid to escape, according to the ELN commander, who would only give his nom-de-guerre Yerson.“He’s dead,” Yerson told Reuters in a remote area along the banks of a river that sees frequent combat between the leftist rebels, government troops and right-wing paramilitaries.“The grenade exploded ... several of our boys were wounded, the entire unit of five boys. He fled, he was shot and killed ... The issue of his body will be negotiated,” he said, adding that the death took place within his unit. Yerson supplied no evidence to back up his assertions.Another person with knowledge of the matter also subsequently confirmed that Voskanyan had been killed.Reuters could not independently confirm the circumstances surrounding Voskanyan’s death.Colombia’s government said it knows nothing of the ELN’s claim and the last it knew was a statement from the ELN that said he had escaped.“The responsibility is with the ELN,” the senior official said, asking not to be named.The Russian Embassy in Colombia, Colombia’s High Peace Commissioner and the Foreign Ministry in Moscow did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The ELN’s practice of kidnapping civilians is a key issue at peace talks taking place in the Ecuadorean capital of Quito. The fact that Voskanyan was killed as talks progress and the ELN failed to inform the government may complicate already tricky negotiations to end 53 years of war and make the need to agree a ceasefire more pressing.“It makes it urgent to get a bilateral, verifiable ceasefire as soon as possible so this doesn’t keep happening,” leftist Senator Antonio Navarro Wolff, who once belonged to now-demobilized urban guerrilla group the M-19, told Reuters.Yerson and his troops said they are not optimistic a peace agreement can be reached because neither side will give ground on kidnapping.The ELN has refused to stop taking hostages for ransom, launching bomb attacks and extorting foreign oil and mining companies while talks are ongoing. The government has said it will not move forward on issues like a bilateral ceasefire until it does.Talks with the ELN are being held as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), until this year the biggest rebel group, has demobilized, formed a new political party and ended its part in a civil war that killed more than 220,000 people and displaced millions over five decades.ELN HAD SAID HOSTAGE ESCAPEDHis face covered by a thin black balaclava and wearing a beret and camouflage fatigues, Yerson, 35, said he has been fighting in Colombia’s jungles and mountains “for many, many years.”Flanked by two fighters carrying semi-automatic rifles as other rebels watched on, he questioned the government’s willingness to make sufficient concessions but said he would adhere to the wishes of his leadership if a peace deal was reached.The ELN has sought peace before, holding talks in Cuba and Venezuela between 2002 and 2007, but experts have said those discussions were dogged by lack of will on both sides.Yerson is the commander of the Ernesto “Che” Guevara Front, that fights under the command of the ELN leader known as Uriel who commands the Western War Block Omar Gomez. He declined to say how many rebels fight in his unit.The ELN - which has kidnapped hundreds of Colombians and foreigners for economic and political gain - previously said in a statement that Voskanyan escaped injured after a struggle that left several fighters wounded as they tried to release him to the International Committee of the Red Cross.The killing of Voskanyan may turn already dire public perception further against the ELN, analyst Ariel Avila told Reuters.“The impact will be on public opinion and in the questioning of the talks,” he said.Inspired by the Cuban revolution and established by radical Catholic priests in 1964, the ELN was close to disappearing in the 1970s but steadily gained power again.By 2002 it had as many as 5,000 fighters, financed by “war taxes” levied on landowners and oil companies. It is now believed to have about 2,000 fighters, but Yerson, who would not confirm the number, said the group is heavily recruiting.Considered a terrorist group by the United States and the European Union, the ELN has stepped up attacks on economic infrastructure this year, hitting oil pipelines and power lines repeatedly.President Juan Manuel Santos, who meted out some of the most crushing military blows against the FARC and earned a Nobel Peace Prize last year for his efforts at peace, has had less success with the ELN, which moves in mobile units of four or so fighters.The ELN has said it may declare a temporary ceasefire to honor Pope Francis during his visit next week to Colombia.(Additional reporting by Vladimir Soldatkin in Moscow; Editing by Andrew Cawthorne, Mary Milliken and Bill Trott)"
83,RELIGION,"On Holiest Day In Islamic Calendar, Houston Muslims Lend A Helping Hand",Antonia Blumberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/houston-muslim-youth-harvey_us_59a9e3d3e4b0dfaafcf07ee4,"""This is going to be an Eid we’re never going to forget.""",2017-09-02,"People walk through water to escape from their homes on Highway 90 after Hurricane Harvey caused heavy flooding in Houston, Texas on Aug. 28, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59a9fb161700002000287ecc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Bilal Rana and his family were trapped in their Houston home for several days as Hurricane Harvey wreaked havoc on their city. Eventually, it became necessary to venture out for milk.“I have five children, all under the age of 12, including a two year old,” Rana said on Friday. “In our family, we go through milk like oxygen.”The 38-year-old physician managed to look up a supermarket that appeared to be open, roughly a mile away, and he set out on foot.“Pretty soon I found myself in waist-high water,” he said. “I saw full-sized fish swimming through the water ― and we don’t live near any lakes or rivers.“It was almost apocalyptic.”Nearly 35,000 people have been displaced in the week since Harvey made landfall in Texas as a Category 4 hurricane. More than 70,000 people remain without power. At least 35 storm-related fatalities have been confirmed to date, according to Reuters.The catastrophic storm dumped an estimated 27 trillion gallons of water on Texas and Louisiana ― an amount that would be roughly sufficient to supply New York City for more than five decades.Once Rana was able to make it out of his neighborhood, he and other members of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Youth Association, an organization of young Ahmadi Muslim men, sprang into action.Rana, who’s lived in Houston since he was an infant, serves as president of AMYA and helped oversee relief efforts throughout the week. Groups of young Muslim men, many of them in their teens and 20s, Rana said, have gone out in boats throughout the city to rescue families trapped in ― and sometimes on top of ― their homes. “At our mosque we’ve also been cooking hot food ― butter chicken, lentils, rice,” Rana said. “A lot of people have been getting non-perishable food, which is great. But we found that a lot of these homeless and displaced people really crave hot food. It warms the stomach and warms the heart.”The association partnered with relief organization Humanity First, Rana said, which provided funds for things like baby food and supplies, crates of water, non-perishable food items, and gloves and masks for rescue missions. “We’d get items in bulk, and they’d vanish. The demand is so high,” he said. Amid their relief work, Rana said, many of the Houston AMYA chapter’s 140 members have been affected by the storm. And even with waves of other AMYA chapters around the country sending groups to Houston to help out throughout the week, Rana said their work is still far from complete. “A lot of the phase one has been addressed,” he said. “Next, our crew will be visiting affected neighborhoods, going door to door asking if anyone has large items that need moving from the inside to outside. After major flooding, many families are forced to throw out entire household’s worth of moldy, ruined furniture. They also have to rip up floors and gut their walls, taking pictures of everything as they work for insurance purposes. Even the strongest bodies can’t do this work alone, Rana said.“A mattress normally takes maybe two people to carry. When it’s full of water, it takes four to five people. You wouldn’t believe how heavy it is.”On Friday, several AMYA crews had already set out to help families with clean up. Fridays of every week are sacred to Muslims as the day when communities come together for weekly prayers. This Friday, Sept. 1, also happens to be one of the holiest days in the Islamic year.Eid al-Adha, the three-day Festival of Sacrifice, began on Friday and commemorates Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice his son Ishmael in obedience to God in scripture. For many Muslims, the holiday represents submission to God and the sacrifices one can make in God’s name to serve one’s community.Some celebrants mark the day by slaughtering an animal and distributing the meat to family and to the poor.Many Houston mosques and Muslim groups put their faith into action throughout the week, opening their doors to displaced residents. The Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim civil rights and advocacy group, also encouraged Muslims in the U.S. to observe Eid by donating the equivalent of whatever they would spend on the sacrifice to assist in relief efforts for those impacted by Harvey.At Rana’s local Ahmadiyya mosque, Baitus Samee, much of the carpeting was soaked in the storm and needed to be ripped up. At first, he said, they weren’t sure they’d be able to host Eid services. But the community improvised, laying down temporary padding so worshippers could kneel for prayer.An imam spoke from the pulpit about the meaning of sacrifice in the context of Harvey. After the sermon, Rana said worshippers turned to one another to embrace.“Yes, the roof leaked, and yes the carpet wasn’t in the best shape,” he said. “But this is going to be an Eid we’re never going to forget.”Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.
