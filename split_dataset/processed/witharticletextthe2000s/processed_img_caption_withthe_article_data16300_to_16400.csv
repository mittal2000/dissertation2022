But she finished fourth on Friday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a86cee01e000046057abe2c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Team USA snowboarder Lindsey Jacobellis on Friday just barely missed the chance to take a place at the podium during her fourth Winter Olympics. The veteran athlete missed a bronze medal by 0.03 seconds in the snowboarding cross final. She trailed gold medalist Michela Moioli by a mere 0.46 seconds.She led at the start to the midway point but was later thrown off by a crashing rider, NBC reports. Jacobellis, 32, won a silver in 2006 but a showboat move caused her to fall and give up a huge lead ― and the gold. She was then disqualified in the semifinals in 2010 and crashed in the semis in 2014.Away from the Olympics, she has had a stellar career, earning 10 golds at the X Games and five world championships. But another Olympic letdown (see video of the race here) didn’t seem to get her down too much.“I could be upset, but where is that going to get me?” she said."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a4d427f1c0000220068e6dc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney announced on Friday that he is running for the U.S. Senate seat being left vacant by retiring Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch (R).“Given all that America faces, we feel that this is the right time for me to serve our state and our country,” he said in a video posted on Twitter.A win for the former Massachusetts governor could be a major blow to President Donald Trump, as Romney spoke out against Trump both during the 2016 election and after the president hesitated to condemn white supremacists last summer. He bashed Trump as a “phony” and “a fraud” in March 2016 and said he couldn’t vote for him.Reports that Romney would run for the seat began circulating in September, when rumors arose that Hatch ― the longest-serving Senate Republican and one of Trump’s fiercest advocates ― was planning to retire at the end of his term. Hatch officially announced his retirement in early January. That same day, the location associated with Romney’s Twitter account was changed from Massachusetts to Holladay, Utah, where he owns a home. Romney, who in 2012 became the first-ever Mormon to secure a major-party presidential nomination, is slated to be the front-runner in the November Senate race. Unlike Hatch, who has fallen out of favor with Utah voters, Romney is immensely popular with the state’s Mormon base. A Salt Lake Tribune poll in October found that 44 percent of respondents wanted Romney to run for Hatch’s seat. In the hours after Hatch’s retirement announcement, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders would not say whether Trump would back Romney. In addition to speaking out against Trump, Romney was also one of the few Republican lawmakers to make an unequivocal statement against Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore, who had been accused of sexually assaulting and harassing teen girls when he was in his 30s. Moore, who had Trump’s enthusiastic support, ultimately lost to Democratic candidate Doug Jones. Despite their clashes, Trump reportedly floated Romney as a potential pick for secretary of state last year. "

David Perdue (R-Ga.), President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on April 21, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a87115d210000500060173b.jpeg?cache=zZgIWRrzPb&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A Republican House member seems a bit confused why the public is still discussing the domestic abuse allegations that forced White House staff secretary Rob Porter from his job last week.“I’m not saying he’s innocent, but I’m saying we don’t know,” Rep. Claudia Tenney (R-N.Y.) said Wednesday during an interview on upstate New York radio station WUTQ. “He could be the worst guy in the world, but now we’re getting into prosecution, as far as I know. I guess there was an issue about ― maybe the FBI knew about it ― but really, is this what we’re talking about at this point?”She added: “Once they found out about it, they let the guy go. Why are we still talking about it?” Porter resigned from the White House on Feb. 7 after both his ex-wives publicly accused him of physical, verbal and emotional abuse. He has denied the allegations. Porter hasn’t been charged with any criminal offense. That, Tenney said repeatedly, means the accusations most likely are fake.“There might be an element of truth to [the allegations], but why wasn’t this guy prosecuted before if these things were happening?” she asked.“Has this guy committed a crime? Has anyone prosecuted him for his alleged abuse against the past wives?” One of the radio hosts pointed out that because the abuse allegations affected Porter’s ability to get high-level security clearance, he was susceptible to blackmail. Tenney quickly dismissed that issue, saying domestic abuse is not a “crime of character.” “Blackmail and domestic situations don’t really line up. They’re not crimes of character,” she said. “They’re character, but they’re not dishonesty. To me ... just because somebody has been accused of these things ― and even if they’re true ― that doesn’t necessarily mean he’s going to be dishonest and commit blackmail.”Tenney blamed Republican Party reluctance to embrace Trump’s presidency as a reason he may have made a rushed decision to employ Porter. “When you don’t have anyone supporting you that’s part of the structure, you’ve got to find people that aren’t always the best and you find that out later because you literally just need someone to do the job,” Tenney said.“Obviously the issue of sexual assault or any of those things, anything like that is very serious, but we’re also getting into the minutiae of what’s going on with the White House,” Tenney said.“There are so many things happening with this White House, people coming and going, and new people.” Listen to Tenney’s full interview below.Tenney cited her experience as a divorce lawyer in casting doubt on the accusations by both of Porter’s ex-wives. “I’ve had divorce cases where terrible abuse is going on and the person doesn’t do anything about it, usually it’s the wife, sometimes it’s the husband,” she said. “But in cases like this, I’ve seen cases where somebody hurts themselves and they go in and blame their ex-husband. Or their ex-husband to be. The person wasn’t even there.”President Donald Trump and his administration have been criticized for how the White House handled the accusations. Trump and other aides continued to defend Porter, even after he resigned. Meredith Kelly, communications director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, criticized Tenney’s comments on Friday as “shameful and frankly disgusting.”“Survivors of domestic abuse have a hard enough time coming forward without Members of Congress casting doubt on their stories,” Kelly said in a press release. “Tenney’s disturbing smear of two women confronting their abuser shows why she needs to be replaced.”Tenney did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8717692000004d00eaf19f.jpeg?cache=xC4W3s6StV&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The FBI said Friday that it did not follow protocol after a caller submitted a tip about the Florida shooting suspect earlier this year.Nikolas Cruz, a 19-year-old who was previously expelled from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, confessed to opening fire on the school this week. At least 17 people were killed. Someone contacted the FBI’s public tip line in January to alert it to Cruz’s behavior, according to a statement from the agency. The caller said this behavior included a “desire to kill people” and “the potential of him conducting a school shooting.” “Under established protocols, the information provided by the caller should have been assessed as a potential threat to life. The information then should have been forwarded to the FBI Miami field office, where appropriate investigative steps would have been taken,” reads the statement. “We have determined that these protocols were not followed.”Cruz was charged Thursday with 17 counts of premeditated murder. He is being held without bail.The tip earlier this year appears to be the second time the law enforcement agency was alerted to Cruz’s behavior. In September, a Mississippi man reported a comment that a YouTube user named “nikolas cruz” had left on a video. The comment said, “Im going to be a professional school shooter.”FBI Director Christopher Wray said the bureau was still investigating the facts.“I am committed to getting to the bottom of what happened in this particular matter, as well as reviewing our processes for responding to information that we receive from the public. It’s up to all Americans to be vigilant, and when members of the public contact us with concerns, we must act properly and quickly,” Wray said. “We have spoken with victims and families, and deeply regret the additional pain this causes all those affected by this horrific tragedy. All of the men and women of the FBI are dedicated to keeping the American people safe, and are relentlessly committed to improving all that we do and how we do it.”Attorney General Jeff Sessions said it was clear that warning signs were missed and resulted in “tragic consequences.” He promised a review. “The FBI in conjunction with our state and local partners must act flawlessly to prevent all attacks. This is imperative, and we must do better,” Sessions said. “We will make this a top priority. It has never been more important to encourage every person in every community to spot the warning signs and alert law enforcement.”Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) called on Wray to resign, calling the bureau’s failure to act “unacceptable.”“Seventeen innocent people are dead and acknowledging a mistake isn’t going to cut it,” Scott said in a statement. “An apology will never bring these 17 Floridians back to life or comfort the families who are in pain.”Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said later Friday that his office had received roughly 20 “calls for service” regarding Cruz over the last few years.“Every one of these calls will be looked at and scrutinized,” he said.According to police, Cruz legally purchased an AR-15-style rifle in February 2017 after passing a background check that included a review of whether he had been found “mentally defective” by the state. After the shooting, several of Cruz’s former classmates described him as a troubled individual who had previously exhibited violent tendencies.“He always had guns on him and stuff like that,” one former classmate told CBS Miami. “Honestly, a lot of people a lot of people were saying it was going to be him.”This article has been updated with additional information about the shooting, as well as with comment from Scott and Sessions."

Hodges, the landmark civil rights case that guaranteed same-sex couples the right to marry.“That’s an assault on nature,” he said during a conversation on same-sex marriage and contraception. “And anytime you assault nature, there’s going to be a backlash. That’s what we’re seeing today. … Whenever you go against God’s plan, bad things are going to happen.”Giampietro, who is currently assistant general counsel of the Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company, also called it “irrefutable” that children are better off being raised by a heterosexual couple. (This is not true. Gay parents may be the best of all.)In July 2014, Giampietro did another interview with LoCoco on her previous show, “Nazareth Project.” This time, he said same-sex marriage was really about sex and not love.“This new definition of marriage actually focuses marriage on the sex act,” Giampietro said. “Because if it were simply that we wanted to honor the love of two people, we would allow sons to marry their mothers, brothers to marry their sisters, for example, to get them health care. Isn’t that a beautiful thing? Doesn’t society think that would be a great thing, if a sister could get her brother on health care?” Giampietro, 52, has said other things that could come back to bite him in his Senate confirmation hearing, which has not been scheduled yet.He wrote on a blog in March 2014 that “calls for diversity” are “code for relaxed standards.” In 2010, he said he became an advocate for school voucher programs after growing up in Washington, D.C., and seeing that “the children who succeeded in Washington were in private schools, and the children who turned out to be criminals were in public schools.”Giampietro’s nomination fits into a broader pattern of anti-LGBTQ court picks from Trump. Some of his now-confirmed circuit court judges include John Bush, who compared abortion to slavery and said he strongly disagrees with same-sex marriage, and Leonard Steven Grasz, who proposed amending the Omaha City Charter to let employers discriminate against LGBTQ people.“One in three of Trump’s judicial nominees have an explicit anti-LGBT record,” said Sharon McGowan, director of strategy at LGBTQ civil rights organization Lambda Legal. “The vitriolic and incendiary anti-LGBT rhetoric from Giampietro captured in this recording, while shocking and disturbing, is unfortunately par for the course with respect to many of the judicial nominees coming out of this White House.”Lambda Legal is one of several human rights groups calling on Trump to withdraw Giampietro’s nomination in light of his radio interviews. Other groups include the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the Human Rights Campaign, Alliance for Justice, the National Center for Lesbian Rights, and People For the American Way.“Even compared to the anti-LGBT record of so many other Trump judicial nominees, Giampietro’s comments are appalling,” said Marge Baker of People For the American Way. “There’s no way that members of the LGBT community could expect fair treatment in a courtroom presided over by this nominee.”A White House spokesman did not respond to a request for comment about Giampietro."

The law was passed by the state legislature and signed by Governor John Kasich last December. Kasich had previously called the law “appropriate.”Down syndrome is a genetic disorder caused when abnormal cell division results in an extra full or partial copy of chromosome 21.Under the law, doctors would lose their medical licenses in the state and face a fourth-degree felony charge if they were to perform an abortion with that knowledge. Mothers would not face criminal charges.“If Ohio politicians wanted to proactively take a stance for people with disabilities, they should improve access to health care, education, or other services,” Freda Levenson, legal director for the ACLU of Ohio, said in a statement. “This ban is just a thinly-veiled attempt to criminalize abortion in Ohio.”Officials with the Ohio Attorney General’s office could not immediately be reached to comment.Ohio Right to Life president Mike Gonidakis criticized the ACLU suit calling the act of ending a pregnancy after a Down syndrome diagnosis a “discriminatory abortion.”“It is a shame that an organization that claims to be the very biggest and best at defending victims of discrimination completely disregards the most vulnerable members of our society,” he said in a statement.The Ohio law marks the 20th restriction on abortion and reproductive rights signed by Kasich since 2011, according to Kellie Copeland, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio.Similar laws have been passed in Indiana and North Dakota. An Indiana District Court issued a permanent injunction on a similar Down syndrome abortion ban on Sept. 22, 2017."

Now, it seems, Bennet has decided to provide The New York Times staff with a 1,500-word explanation on why these men and women are not actually upset about the opinion section’s attempts at heterodoxy. Instead, they are scared of being challenged. He also makes sure to remind the staff that he is “picking our contributors with care, looking for people who share Times standards for fairness and intellectual honesty and originality.” People such as John Lott, who Bennet published two days ago and who is one of the most widely discredited gun researchers working today.He closes by, essentially, begging his newsroom colleagues, the people whose jobs it is to hold major institutions accountable and urge transparency, to please keep any criticism (and subsequent leaks) to themselves.On a related note, if you work at The New York Times and would like to get in touch, you can reach me by email at ashley.feinberg@huffpost.com.

The new parents are wearing matching surgical masks in a picture Scott shared Thursday on his Snapchat account. The “Butterfly Effect” rapper wrote “bdjxjkdn” in upside-down neon lettering over the photo.The text and masks don’t quite make sense without context, but we’re betting they’re part of an inside joke relating to the couple’s newborn, Stormi Webster (Scott’s real name is Jacques Webster). But we’re open to any and all theories. The photo is the first social media sign of the couple since Jenner posted a video and message announcing Stormi’s birth. The video they released to fans on Feb. 4, called “To Our Daughter,” shows the couple throughout Jenner’s pregnancy. Jenner and Scott both stepped out separately a few days after Stormi’s birth, and Jenner has become more active on social media. Earlier this week, she posted photos of herself wearing a maroon tracksuit that coordinated with her Bentley: And she later shared a sultry snap for Valentine’s Day: It’s only a matter of time before we see Jenner, Scott and Stormi pose for a family picture, right?

All three ladies brought their fashion A-game to the event (though if we have to choose, we’ll go with Zendaya for the win) and seemed to get along fine.Until the internet stepped in. (Good job, internet.) In a couple of clips that have made the rounds, the former Disney star appears to give Lively and Blunt the side-eye, while the two actresses share a laugh. The moment spawned a swarm of memes about the power of Zendaya’s disdain, with others speculating as to what might’ve angered her.Zendaya, however, wasn’t going to let that slide, and quickly set the internet straight about exactly what went down in the front row.“I 🗣WAS🗣LOOKING🗣AT🗣THE🗣RUNWAY🗣” she clarified on Twitter. “Y’all messy that’s all lmao.”She added: “Whoa whoa whoa y’all not bout to have me out here lookin shady.

In 2014, he launched a scheme to provide bank accounts to the nearly 40 percent of the population with little or no access to financial services. In November 2016, he withdrew 500 and 1,000 rupee notes ($7.80 and $15.60), the country’s two most common banknotes, from circulation. The aim was to clamp down on black-market money and get more people into the formal economy, but it had a negative effect on the poor, with micro and small-scale service businesses cutting 35 percent of staff in the first few months, and some families left unable to afford fruit and vegetables. Cash is on the decline worldwide; non-cash transactions grew 11.2 percent globally in 2015. But for some, the Modi experiment is a sign that cashless societies will hurt the poor, and India is not alone in having poor, unbanked populations. An estimated 7 percent of American households don’t have access to bank accounts, according to the most recent survey from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. And a government study at the end of last year found that the U.S. homeless population had risen for the first time since 2010. Given rising inequality, what happens to those on the margins of the economy when cash is no longer king?Proponents of a shift away from cash often point to Kenya or Sweden as proof that such a transition can happen without further disadvantaging the poor. In Sweden, which is on track to be the world’s first cashless society, a magazine called Situation Stockholm has equipped its homeless sellers with credit card readers. And M-Pesa, a mobile money service first rolled out in Kenya, has 30 million subscribers and has been credited with raising 2 percent of Kenyan households out of extreme poverty. But Mehrsa Baradaran, associate dean for strategic initiatives and J. Alton Hosch associate professor of law at the University of Georgia, says that absent these countries’ unique context, these examples would be difficult to follow in the U.S.“Kenya had one national bank and one mobile company that had a monopoly,” she explains. “Everyone was on the same mobile network so they just rolled out M-Pesa on the mobiles and everyone immediately got on.” The U.S. has a dual banking system (state and federal) and more than 6,500 banks meaning rolling out mobile banking would require a lot more coordination, says Baradaran. “Kenya had a different population ― more poverty and less of a profit model-oriented banking system.”As for Sweden, Baradaran says, “They just don’t have the level of poverty that we do. ... They have a lot of social services and they’ve transitioned off cash because they have a less-stratified society.”Economist Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard professor who formerly served as the chief economist for the International Monetary Fund, argues in his book The Curse of Cash for a gradual elimination of cash to get at the black market and to crack down on tax evasion. To protect the unbanked, he proposes “making free basic debit card accounts available to everyone, as many countries are now doing,” he told HuffPost. “If India can make free basic accounts available to everyone, surely the U.S. can do the same.”But Baradaran points out that U.S. banks have historically refused to do this. “In the U.S., banks have a monopoly on payments and transactions,” she says. “If you’re unbanked, you have to operate in cash. All of these fintech providers, like Venmo, PayPal, etc., they all connect to banks too. So, how do we force people into banks? There have been so many efforts in the U.S. over the years to get banks to offer free accounts, but [the banks] refuse because those accounts aren’t profitable for them.”Grant Kerber, a volunteer with Oakland Omni Commons and Food Not Bombs, says the suggestion to simply bank the unbanked “seems out of touch” with how poor people actually live. “Things like ID cards, driver’s licenses, these are already incredibly difficult for people who are marginalized in society to get access to, so the whole digital payment thing just pushes the goal post even further out.”Not that there aren’t problems with cash. “It’s actually really expensive to be unbanked,” Baradaran explains. “You’re constantly having to pay out part of your income in fees to turn your cash into other forms of transactional currency ― a prepaid card, for example ― or to turn your cash into checks and back again.”She does have a potential solution. In her book How the Other Half Banks, Baradaran suggests a postal banking system. “There are already brick and mortar post offices in most neighborhoods, so my idea was that people could bring cash to the post office, they could hold it for them and give them a digital account,” she says.Such a system would be appealing to the fintech folks, who might pick up hundreds of thousands of new customers by linking to these postal accounts, and shouldn’t bother the banks, which have been avoiding dealing with this segment of the population for years. But Baradaran says she still gets a lot of pushback on it from economists and academics, mostly middle- or upper-class people who see the proposition of having to stand in line at the post office to bank as untenable. “But that’s because they’re not the ones it’s for,” Baradaran says. “It’s not for people who are already living comfortably with a bank account and direct deposit, who can just bank through the mobile app on their phones. It’s for people who have none of that.”“Unless you’re poor, it’s hard to understand what it’s like to be poor,” Baradaran says. “And a lot of people don’t realize that if you go into any water office or electric utility office in the country right now, there’s a line of people in there waiting to pay their bill in cash.”For more content and to be part of the “This New World” community, join our Facebook Group.

17,POLITICS,Trump’s Historic Medicaid Shift Goes Beyond Work Requirements,"Stateline, Editorial Partner",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trumps-historic-medicaid-shift-goes-beyond-work-requirements_us_5a86fcace4b08896770933fd,The new requirements likely will cause many Medicaid beneficiaries to be removed from the rolls.,2018-02-16,"<p>A doctor examines a Medicaid patient at the Heart City Health Center in Elkhart, Indiana. Indiana and other states are seizing on a shift by the Trump administration to enact stricter Medicaid requirements. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a86fd392100003100601703.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Michael OlloveRequiring able-bodied adults to work for their Medicaid is just part of the Trump administration’s drive to remake the decades-old health insurance program for the poor.The administration signaled late last year that it welcomes state-based ideas to retool Medicaid and “help individuals live up to their highest potential.” At least 10 states have requested waivers that would allow them to impose work requirements and other obligations.For example: They would require more recipients to contribute small monthly premiums. They would insist on monthly paperwork. They would impose lifetime limits on coverage. And they would kick recipients off Medicaid for a period of time — 30 days, or perhaps six months — for failing to follow the rules.All the states requesting Medicaid work requirements are led by Republican governors who tout the “it’s a trampoline, not a hammock” approach to the social services safety net.In the past few weeks, the Trump administration has granted approval to Kentucky and Indiana to begin imposing new requirements for Medicaid recipients that are likely to push some people off the rolls. Arizona, Arkansas, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Utah and Wisconsin — all led by Republican governors — also have requested federal permission to adopt new requirements. Medicaid is a joint federal-state program, so states need federal approval to make substantial changes.In Kentucky alone close to 97,000 people will lose Medicaid benefits over the next five years as a result of new changes, one study estimated. In Mississippi, Medicaid enrollment would shrink by 58,995 — 9 percent — in the first year alone, according to the state’s application to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.The Southern Poverty Law Center, the National Health Law Program and the Kentucky Equal Justice Center have sued to block implementation of the Medicaid changes in Kentucky. The three civil rights organizations are arguing that the Trump administration has overridden the federal Medicaid law, which only Congress can do, “overturning a half century of administrative practice, and threatening irreparable harm to the health and welfare of the poorest and most vulnerable in our country.”More Uninsured?Indiana and Kentucky, as well as Arizona, Arkansas and New Hampshire, all expanded Medicaid eligibility to more low-income adults under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. As a result, all of those states boosted the percentage of their residents with some form of health insurance. (Maine voters last year also approved the expansion, though the state hasn’t implemented it yet.)But the imposition of new requirements would reverse some of those gains. It also entails a sharp break from the Obama administration’s explicit position that all changes to state Medicaid policies had to “increase and strengthen overall coverage of low-income individuals in the state.”The Trump administration has removed that language as a criterion for approving changes to state Medicaid policies. Instead, the administration announced a different objective for Medicaid.“We have a higher purpose than just handing out Medicaid cards,” Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said in a speech to state Medicaid directors in November. “The Medicaid program is a promise to help individuals live up to their highest potential, leading healthier, more fulfilling, and more independent lives.”Verma’s speech was a prelude to CMS issuing new guidance in November indicating its openness to state proposals to add work requirements to their Medicaid programs, proposals the Obama administration routinely rejected. Out went increasing access to health care to the poor; in came language about employment leading to better health for enrollees by helping them to “rise out of poverty and attain independence.”Instead of increasing access to Medicaid, the Trump administration said the changes it is pursuing will modify the behavior of beneficiaries to “promote upward mobility, greater independence and improved quality of life.”It’s very much in keeping with longtime Republican orthodoxy that safety net programs should be only temporary ports for the poor. The long-term goal should be self-sufficiency. “Medicaid is a tragic example of the soft bigotry of low expectations consistently espoused by the prior administration,” Verma said.Many Republican governors have embraced the shift.“I firmly believe that every human being aspires to earn her own success. For those whose family situation and health allow it, there is nothing quite as beneficial as the sense of accomplishment that comes from work,” Utah Gov. Gary Herbert said in an email to Stateline. “Medicaid meets the needs of many populations, but that part of Medicaid that is intended to help catch those who have fallen on hard times should do all that it can to assist their efforts to return to gainful employment.”But the new philosophy has alarmed many who advocate for health care access for the poor. Instead of helping people obtain work, they say the Trump approach will simply deprive people of health care.“It’s such a wrongheaded punitive policy that won’t achieve the end goal of putting people to work,” said Dee Mahan, director of Medicaid Initiatives at Families USA, a nonprofit that advocates for health care for all. “It’s breathtaking.”‘Lockouts’ and Lifetime LimitsSince 2008, the federal government has given some states, including Indiana, permission to require some Medicaid beneficiaries to pay premiums for their coverage. Thanks to its recent waiver, Kentucky now has the authority to “lock out” beneficiaries for six months unless the person pays past-due premiums and also completes a financial or health literacy course. Maine, New Mexico and Wisconsin are seeking the same authority. (The Obama administration had already given Indiana permission to use lockouts as a concession for the state to expand Medicaid in 2015.)In approving lockouts in Indiana, CMS said that requiring beneficiaries to meet program requirements would “strengthen beneficiary engagement in their personal health care plan” and provide incentives for people to become responsible decision-makers.But at least one study found that imposing premiums in Medicaid leads to fewer people being covered. In Indiana, more than 46,000 otherwise eligible residents were not enrolled in Medicaid between February 2015 and December 2016 because they didn’t make their first payments on time. About 14,000 lost benefits for not making subsequent payments on time. And nearly 10,000 in that group were locked out of benefits for six months.The half-dozen states that charge premiums now generally apply them only to Medicaid beneficiaries at higher income levels. But some states, such as Wisconsin and Maine, want to charge premiums to more beneficiaries. Wisconsin seeks to begin charging premiums of $8 a month to households whose income falls below the federal poverty line. For a family of four, that would mean a household income of no more than $25,100 a year.CMS also gave Kentucky and Indiana the authority to lock out those who fail to renew their Medicaid eligibility on time.Arizona, Kansas, Utah and Wisconsin also want to impose a lifetime limit on coverage. Wisconsin, for example, proposes a lifetime limit of 48 months. Kansas is shooting for 36 months. Arizona and Utah are hoping for five years, although in Arizona’s case, time that an enrollee worked wouldn’t count against the limit. Once time is up, recipients couldn’t receive Medicaid for the rest of their lives.Federal officials also granted Kentucky’s request to end the practice of retroactive eligibility, under which people who are eligible for Medicaid but not enrolled are signed up retroactively when they show up for medical services. Maine is seeking permission to end retroactive eligibility as well.Critics say the Trump administration’s philosophy demonstrates either ignorance about or indifference to the hardships and chaos confronting many who live in poverty. Many work multiple jobs, do contract work or are otherwise in situations where hours and fluctuations in income are hard to predict or to document. They may live in situations in which mail delivery is unreliable. They may not have access to computers.“Many poor people face challenges that will make it very difficult to meet these requirements,” said Joan Alker, executive director of Georgetown University’s Center for Children and Families. “There is low literacy and issues of homelessness, mental illness and addiction. They lack transportation and affordable child care. People will lose coverage because of this, including people who have jobs.”Stateline home pageSign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research "

In one instance, someone approached Pruitt and yelled, “You’re fucking up the environment,” Barnet said.Pruitt has come under fire this week after The Washington Post reported that the administrator was regularly booked in premium cabins, often costing thousands of dollars more than equivalent seats in coach. The report, citing EPA receipts obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, noted several flights cost more than $90,000 in total during a few weeks last June.Federal regulations mandate government employees travel in the “least expensive class of travel” for their needs, but individuals are allowed to book premium seats if there are security concerns.The EPA briefly said this week Pruitt had a “blanket wavier” to travel first class but later rolled back its statement when Politico noted that the regulations state that such travel must be approved on a “trip-by-trip basis.” A spokesman later clarified to the news site that Pruitt’s office submitted a waiver seeking an exemption before each trip, citing security concerns.Until Thursday’s report, it was unclear what those concerns were, although Pruitt defended the bookings in an interview with the New Hampshire Union Leader, blaming what he called a “very toxic environment politically.”“We’ve reached the point where there’s not much civility in the marketplace and it’s created, you know, it’s created some issues and the (security) detail, the level of protection is determined by the level of threat,” he told the Union Leader on Tuesday.Pruitt’s tenure at the EPA over the past year has been controversial among environmentalists. The agency has quickly worked to roll back many regulations meant to combat climate change. The agency has also moved to unravel the Clean Water Act and the Clean Power Plan, and Pruitt was one of the driving forces behind President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw the U.S. from the landmark Paris climate deal.He receives many more threats than his predecessors, E&E News reported in January, and is the first EPA administrator to have a full-time security detail.The agency also refuses to release many details about Pruitt’s schedule in advance, citing similar security concerns."

Nassar, the former team doctor for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University, has been given two concurrent sentences of 40 to 175 years and 40 to 125 years in prison for sexually abusing hundreds of young athletes. Several of Nassar’s victims helped create the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport Authorization Act, which was sponsored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.). The measure received a big push after 265 women delivered victim impact statement during Nassar’s sentence hearings in January. The bill has a three-pronged approach to protecting athletes and regulating governing bodies of amateur athletics. First, it requires coaches, trainers and others to report any sexual abuse allegation to the police within a 24-hour period. Secondly, the legislation extends the statute of limitations to up to 10 years after a victim realizes he or she was abused. And lastly, the bill limits athletes under the age of 18 from being alone with an adult who isn’t their parent. Trump signed the bill behind closed doors in the Oval Office as his administration deals with its own abuse scandal. White House staff secretary Rob Porter and speechwriter David Sorensen both resigned last week after facing allegations of domestic abuse. Trump ― who has been accused of sexual misconduct by 21 women ― defended Porter even after the allegations against him were made public and only said Wednesday that he is “totally opposed to domestic violence of any kind.”Nita Chaudhary, co-founder of women’s organization UltraViolet, said she was happy to see the bill become a law but that it was “deeply disturbing” that Trump had been the one to sign it.

In the meantime, the local Sikh community is troubled that the armed suspect remains free, according to the Sikh Coalition, a national advocacy organization that is representing Singh. “We do still remain concerned that no arrest has been made and the State’s Attorney’s Office has yet to file hate crime charges,” the Sikh Coalition’s legal director and Singh’s lawyer Amrith Kaur said in a statement. “Mr. Singh and the local Sikh community have the right to feel safe. The reality is that hate crimes are not only attacks on individuals; they affect the entire community. They make all of us less safe, and everybody should be outraged by this.” Singh came to the U.S. three years ago to serve the Sikh community in the Quad City area on the Mississippi River as a granthi, an individual who helps lead Sikh congregations through hymns and prayers. He’s a legal resident of the U.S., Kaur said. In late December, Singh, who has a wife and a toddler, started driving with Uber to supplement his income.At 10:39 p.m. on Jan. 28, Singh reportedly picked up two passengers ― a male and a female ― next to a tavern in Moline, Illinois. According to the Sikh Coalition, the man started interrogating Singh about his origins, asking questions like, “Which country do you belong to?” and “Do you serve our country or do you serve your country?”Singh, who speaks limited English, was “confused and scared” by the questions. He explained that he was Sikh and that he serves both the U.S. and his home country of India, since his parents still live there.“The attacker’s behavior escalated more and more as Mr. Singh tried to inform him about his religion, about the tenets of Sikhism, why he wore a turban,” Kaur told HuffPost. “As that went on, the attacker became more and more incensed, to the point where he pulled out a gun.” The woman in the car then “forcibly removed” the male passenger from the vehicle, the coalition said. She then apologized for the male passenger’s behavior and told Mr. Singh to drop her at home and to avoid taking the same route back to eliminate another encounter with the man.Kaur said that Singh is traumatized, especially since the religious leader feels he was attacked because of his Sikh identity.“To be attacked for something you love and respect about yourself ... that is really being attacked at the core,” Kaur said. “He was really fearful and even now he feels insecure about whether this man will come back and attack him again, whether other people will feel emboldened by this as well.”Singh allegedly notified the police about the incident the next day, Jan. 29. The Sikh Coalition is dismayed that, more than two weeks later, the passenger still has not been arrested or charged. The Rock Island County sheriff and the state’s attorney’s office did not respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment.Sheriff Gerry Bustos told The Washington Post that he expects charges will be filed by the end of this week, after Uber responds to a warrant for more information about the attack.An Uber spokesperson told HuffPost that the company is gathering the information requested. It has removed the rider’s access to Uber and is “fully cooperating with law enforcement on their investigation.”“Uber does not tolerate any form of discrimination on the app, and we have reached out to the [driver] to offer our support,” the spokesperson said.Kaur believes that the incident should be prosecuted as a hate crime, with or without the additional evidence from Uber.“I understand the need for a thorough investigation ... but I think when you have a man who has been identified, and a man who makes threats specifically against somebody’s race, religion, ancestry and national origins, and you don’t arrest that person, that sends a clear message,” Kaur told HuffPost. “And to not prosecute this as a hate crime would be to send another clear message. What you’re really doing is telling a community that you don’t care about them.”Although Sikhs have been part of America’s religious landscape for over 100 years, many Americans are unfamiliar with the religion or confuse Sikhs with Muslims. In the years since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Sikh Americans have repeatedly been targets of hate crimes, in part because the turbans and beards Sikh men wear as part of their faith make them stand out as visible minorities.Kaur, who met with local Sikh leaders on Wednesday, said that some Sikhs in the community have been feeling insecure and scared after hearing about what happened to Singh. “There is a man with a gun who has already threatened a member of the community because of his brown skin, turban and beard, and many other community members here fit that description,” she said. “They’re thinking, ‘Does he look at all brown people the same way? If he comes back to attack Gurjeet, is he going to mistake me for him?’” “In the post-9/11 era, with all the hate violence and backlash the Sikh community has to deal with, that’s a very real thought,” Kaur said.

Marco Rubio and Gov. Rick Scott have long fought against gun control legislation.,2018-02-15,"Shortly after the shooting in Parkland, Florida, on Wednesday, Sen. Marco Rubio (R) tweeted that ""Today is that terrible day you pray never comes.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a84dcd41e000037007abbe4.jpeg?cache=AD97JaTGed&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Florida Republicans Sen. Marco Rubio and Gov. Rick Scott were swift to condemn the horrific school shooting in their state on Wednesday afternoon, offering prayers after a gunman killed at least 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland.Scott called for “thoughts and prayers” as news of the shooting emerged, and Rubio sent off a tweet calling the shooting an event “you pray never comes.”But both men have a history of coziness with gun advocates, receiving “A+” ratings and endorsements from the National Rifle Association ahead of their respective elections in 2014 and 2016. The distinction is reserved “for legislators who have excellent voting records on Second Amendment issues and who have vigorously fought to promote and defend the right to keep and bear arms.”During a Republican presidential primary debate in 2015, Rubio said new gun laws were “ineffective” and “infringe on the rights of law-abiding people and do nothing to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people.” A few months later, he went out and bought a gun on Christmas Eve.Some discussed Rubio’s longtime acceptance of campaign donations from the NRA. An analysis by The New York Times last year found he had received more than $3.3 million from the group.Rubio rejected calls for gun control in an interview with Fox News after the Parkland shooting, saying it was the wrong time to discuss such efforts “because people don’t know how this happened.”“I think it’s important to know all of [the facts] before you jump to conclusions that there’s some law we could have passed that could have prevented it,” he said. “There may be, but shouldn’t we at least know the facts? I think that we can always have that debate, but ... you should know the facts of that incident before you run out and prescribe some law you claim could have prevented it.”Later on Wednesday, Rubio said federal authorities told him the shooting was a “clear attack” that was “designed and executed to maximize loss of life.”Scott has also long resisted gun control efforts. Shortly after the massacre at Pulse nightclub in Orlando in 2016, the Florida governor repeatedly said the Second Amendment “didn’t kill anybody.”“Let’s remember, the Second Amendment has been around for over 200 years,” Scott told CNN at the time. “That’s not what killed innocent people; evil killed innocent people.”Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said Wednesday that the shooter in Parkland was armed with an AR-15 assault-style rifle, a high-capacity weapon that has become synonymous with many of America’s deadliest mass shootings. The shooter in the Orlando attack used a similar weapon, which is easier to obtain in Florida than a handgun. HuffPost reporters purchased an AR-15 in Orlando in just 38 minutes only two days after the shooting.Many lawmakers have been urging Congress to take action to rein in access to such weaponry, but those efforts have mostly failed.A bipartisan effort to ban “bump stocks,” which give semiautomatic weapons the capability to fire long bursts of ammunition, gained steam shortly after 58 people died in a mass shooting at a Las Vegas music festival last year. Rubio said he was open to legislation that would ban bump stocks and that Congress should move “to prevent such attacks in the future.”But four months later, the effort has largely failed at the national level, even as states and cities have moved to ban their sale.Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who had just been elected when the Sandy Hook massacre took place, slammed his colleagues on Wednesday after the attack, saying Congress’ inaction had led to such shootings.“This happens nowhere else other than the United States of America,” Murphy said. “This epidemic of mass slaughter ... it only happens here, not because of coincidence, not because of bad luck, but as a consequence of our inaction.” CORRECTION: A previous version of this story mistakenly stated the Orlando shooter used an AR-15.

He told South Africans during a late-night televised address that, although he disagreed with the decision by the ANC to remove him, he would leave “with immediate effect.” It is an ignominious end to a presidency beset by charges of corruption, bad governance, opportunism, economic stagnation and criminality. When South Africa’s National Assembly convenes Thursday, it is expected to elect Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, a Nelson Mandela protégé, as head of state. Zuma, disgraced, will depart the presidency nine years after he was elected. He now faces prosecution and is likely to be ostracized by a party that once reportedly aided and abetted his pillaging of the state but which will now do its best to distance itself from its former leader.While Zuma assumed the presidency under a cloud of corruption and amid deep doubts about his integrity, he once had the support of a large part of the electorate who was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. Many believed that once he was elevated to the position once occupied by a figure as beloved as Mandela, he would rise to the occasion and become more effective than his predecessor, Thabo Mbeki, in advancing the national project of building a new society. For a while, at least, he was a colossus upon South Africa’s political and national terrain, dominating his party and directing the affairs of state. But his repurposing of the nation to serve his personal interests undermined and wounded institutions, violated the constitution and reduced the ANC, which once fought to defeat white minority rule, to a patronage network. Zuma saw the state as his personal protection racket, a network he could use to dispense patronage and wealth. But he also appeared determined to use his office to manipulate key institutions to ensure that he stay out of jail. He quickly took control of key institutions, including the police and intelligence and judicial systems, installing a succession of subservient political figures to protect him and his network. Once he had neutered systems of accountability, he turned his attention to the economic sphere. He cleaned out the South African Revenue Service, installing as its commissioner a minion who engineered the wholesale gutting of one of the jewels in the civil service system.Next up was National Treasury. His good friends and family benefactors, the Gupta brothers, needed access to state coffers, and when ministers of finance seemed to get in the way on two occasions, in December 2015 and again in March 2017, Zuma removed the ministers without consultation. As a result of this so-called state capture, trust in government ― and in the ANC ― suffered greatly, and that eventually led to Zuma’s downfall. Zuma took the reins of a governing party with an electoral majority of close to 70 percent. He went on to mold the ANC in his image: He became the ANC, and the ANC became him. Today, the party is much diminished, its electoral future an uncertainty. The party, which has lost control of major cities, including Johannesburg and Pretoria, could dip below 50 percent in next year’s election and is now deeply divided. Its national conference in December led to a fragile and uncertain détente between battling factions ― one attempting to reform the party and the other seemingly still determined to use it as vehicle for maximum rent extraction from the nation. But if there is a silver lining in the events of the last few months ― which included reporting by an independent press and the display of courage by public servants who called out or investigated corruption ― it is that it reminded South Africans of the lofty ideals that they built their democratic state on in 1994. While South Africa may have lost its innocence, Zuma did not break the country."

The president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America expressed solidarity with Dreamers in an essay for Time magazine, published Wednesday. Richards said reproductive justice and immigrant justice go hand in hand.Many undocumented women seek care at Planned Parenthood, she said, “because our centers are one of the few affordable places they can go, regardless of status, and feel comfortable seeking the care they need.” But many others, she added, forgo treatment for fear of detention or deportation. “Fear stands in the way of undocumented people seeking out health care professionals for treatment of illnesses and basic reproductive care including birth control,” she wrote. “The simplest necessary actions like going to the doctor, picking up a prescription or getting health insurance can become practically impossible. Today, immigrant communities have higher rates of unintended pregnancy and cervical cancer, and some have higher rates of HIV. Almost half of non-citizen women of reproductive age with low incomes lack health insurance.” “At Planned Parenthood, we understand that reproductive justice and immigrant justice are part of the same fight,” she added. “Because when women can share their medical histories openly and access reproductive health care without fear, they are better able to build healthy families, participate in the workforce and control their destinies.”In September 2017, President Donald Trump announced he would rescind the Obama-era program Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) that protects undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children. His decision will leave the nearly 700,000 DACA-recipients, known as Dreamers, at risk of deportation. Trump gave Congress until March 5 to act before an estimated 1,000 people per day begin losing protections, although some DACA-recipients have already been affected.Two federal judges have issued preliminary injunctions blocking Trump’s cancellation of the DACA program, as the White House and many congressional Republicans attempt to use the deadline to add stipulations into a Dream Act that would also increase funding for border security, a border wall, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids and detention centers. Activists have been pushing for a clean Dream Act in response, one that doesn’t punish immigrant communities, with Richards echoing their sentiment in her essay ― in which she notes that Dreamers “enrich and strengthen our country, and they deserve better than to be used as a political bargaining chip.”Last month, Richards announced she would be stepping down as president of Planned Parenthood this year after more than a decade of leading the organization.

27,POLITICS,Voting Lines Are Shorter — But Mostly For Whites,"Stateline, Editorial Partner",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/voting-lines-are-shorter-but-mostly-for-whites_us_5a85a1bbe4b00e7aba2d2978,"Election officials have figured out how to keep voting lines down, but communities of color are still waiting longer to vote.",2018-02-15,"<p>Voters in Phoenix, seen here waiting for polls to open at dawn in November 2016, had to wait as long as four hours to vote during the presidential primary earlier that year. Minority communities have not benefited as much as white communities have from innovations to shorten lines. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a85a1ca2000003500eaef7f.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Matt VasilogambrosOn the day of Arizona’s 2016 presidential primary, the line outside the Maryvale Church of the Nazarene, the Maricopa County polling place for 213,000 mostly Latino, low-income people, extended through the parking lot, down busy North 51st Avenue, and into a neighborhood lined with palm and eucalyptus trees on the western edge of Phoenix.Some voters waited for four hours or more in the 80-degree heat to cast their ballots, according to Martin Quezada, a Democrat who represents the area in the Arizona Senate. Quezada said the long wait time was more than an inconvenience.Latino voters don’t trust the system, Quezada said. “If they don’t have a good experience on Election Day when they are casting their ballot, their likelihood of participating in a system they don’t trust again in the future becomes that much harder.”Across the country, elections officials are marshaling data on registered voters, historic turnout, parking spaces and other information to reduce wait times at polling places. Also helping to decrease wait times is voting by mail, which is available in 22 states, and early voting, which is now offered in 37 states — though a couple of states have rolled back their early voting.But white voters are benefiting far more from such innovations than Hispanic or black voters are. As the nation gears up for what is shaping up to be a high-energy midterm election this November, the disparity is likely to loom large.In the 2016 presidential election, black voters, on average, waited 16 minutes to vote, while Latino voters waited 13 minutes, according to a Massachusetts Institute of Technology survey of voters. In the same election, white voters waited 10 minutes. In 2012, black and Latino voters stood in line for more than 20 minutes to cast their ballot, nearly twice as long as white voters.Stephen Pettigrew, a political scientist at the University of Pennsylvania, has found if there are two neighborhoods in the same city, and one is majority-white and the other has more blacks and Hispanics, voters in the white neighborhood have a shorter wait.Voting rights advocates call the disparity a “time tax.” They argue that it violates the fundamental right to vote — and that it is often intentional.“We are in a state of threat to voting rights,” said Denise Lieberman, co-director of the Power and Democracy program at the Washington, D.C.-based Advancement Project, a civil rights organization. “Some actions, like changing polling places, may seem benign on its face, but they are creating havoc.”Fewer ResourcesIn poorer counties and cities, long lines may stem from a lack of resources. But even in wealthier counties, minority communities tend to get fewer polling places, voting machines and poll workers than white neighborhoods in the same county, according to a 2014 study from the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University’s School of Law. “Minority precincts have tended to get the short end of the resource allocation stick,” the study concluded.Lieberman argues that in many counties, election officials are less inclined to provide minority communities with the resources that can shorten lines.It’s one of many policies that are “creating a climate of discrimination,” Lieberman said, in the same vein as restrictive voter ID laws, the slashing of early voting in states like Florida and North Carolina, and the consolidation of polling places, all of which adversely affect communities of color. Local officials and state lawmakers are trying to suppress the minority vote, Lieberman said.“None of this is a coincidence,” Lieberman said. “The folks who pass these laws know their impact. … Communities of color bear the brunt of a lack of legal protection.”In North Carolina, a federal court agreed in 2016, saying many of the state’s restrictive voting laws, including strict voter ID requirements and a rollback of early voting, “target African-Americans with almost surgical precision.” North Carolina lawmakers said the laws were passed to protect state elections against fraud and to save counties money.Cutting Voting LinesLocal election officials know how to keep voting lines short, which makes this time gap so frustrating for voting scholars such as Charles Stewart III, the director of MIT’s Voting Technology Project.U.S. voters’ wait time shrank to 11 minutes in the 2016 presidential election, down from 14 minutes in 2012, according to MIT’s quadrennial survey. Further, the survey found, fewer voters waited more than an hour to cast their ballot than in the previous election. County officials should be using best-practice tools to decrease wait times in all precincts regardless of their racial makeup, Stewart said.Many of those tools were implemented after the 2012 presidential election, where hellish voting lines in states such as Florida made national news. (On average, according to MIT’s survey, it took Florida voters 46 minutes to cast their ballots that year.) President Barack Obama took notice, and in 2013 he appointed a bipartisan commission, led by the chief lawyers from his campaign and Republican nominee Mitt Romney’s campaign, to solve the issues that plagued the country’s electoral system.One of the commission’s primary recommendations was to use data, such as voter registration numbers and parking availability near polling places, to better manage polling places, which would in turn decrease the size of lines. The commission’s goal was to make sure no American ever waits more than a half-hour to vote.Tammy Patrick, a senior adviser at the nonprofit Democracy Fund and a member of the commission, said that because election officials are following its recommendations, “the preponderance of lines is going down.”Stewart, for his part, launched an online “toolkit,” which he said is now used by a quarter of the country’s local election officials to help them deploy enough poll booths, poll workers and ballot scanners to handle Election Day voting.“If you’re not gathering that data,” Stewart said, “you’re running blind.”Michael Scarpello, the registrar of voters in San Bernardino County, California, has embraced that lesson.To serve the largest geographic county in the contiguous 48 states, Scarpello and his analytics department take a large swath of data — registered voters, historic turnout, parking spaces, voter behavior, capacity of polling places — to assign poll workers, distribute supplies­­ and assign voters to specific polling locations, freeing up busy locations and utilizing underused places. Using this data, Scarpello is able to update polling place capacity by the hour in a county of nearly 900,000 registered voters.“If there are lines, they are short,” Scarpello said. At most, voters wait five minutes.The county’s immediate response to Election Day voter behavior lowers the length of lines, the cost of elections, and the time it takes to count ballots. Between 2008 and 2016, the county cut its ballot-counting time nearly in half, from 16 hours to nine, Scarpello said.“Our job is to make voting as convenient as possible for voters,” Scarpello said. “If voters are motivated, we don’t want to put any barriers in their way.”Closing the GapVoting lines in Orange County, California, never surpass nine minutes, said Neal Kelley, the county’s registrar of voters. That’s significant because the county is the fifth-largest voting jurisdiction in the country and because a third of the electorate is Latino.There is no difference in wait times between Orange County’s majority-white Newport Beach and majority-Latino Santa Ana, Kelley said. Countywide, the average wait time for voters dropped drastically in recent years after Kelley began using sophisticated data techniques to change how they allocate the county’s 11,000 voting booths and 9,000 poll workers among 1,300 polling places.As the county prepares for a potentially competitive congressional election for 15-term Republican U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher’s seat this November, Kelley said he’s relying on data from 2010, the last hotly contested midterm election, to estimate turnout for this one.Kelley said he will monitor precincts closely on Election Day. “One booth could make all the difference in the world.”In Maricopa County, where Quezada and his neighbors waited so long to vote in 2016, the official in charge of that election has paid a price.Helen Purcell, then Maricopa County’s recorder since 1989, had reduced the numberof polling places for the 2016 primary, recommending 60 polling places in the fourth-largest county in the United States, down from 200 in 2012.In the aftermath of the election, The Arizona Republic found that low-income, Latino neighborhoods bore the brunt of the decrease. Purcell, a Republican, denied that race was a motivating factor, but she faced widespread criticism and lost her reelection bid to Democrat Adrian Fontes, who became the first Latino elected as Maricopa County recorder.After he won, Fontes promised that actions that might limit the Latino vote in future elections will be “very vigilantly avoided.”Stateline home pageSign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research "

Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) lashed out at his former colleague Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Thursday, saying the nation’s top law enforcement official had stepped out of his lane by weighing in on a drug sentencing reform bill that had bipartisan support.Grassley, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, supports the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act, which passed the committee 16-5 on Thursday but faces a tough road ahead. Sessions’ letter on the bill, which would reduce mandatory minimum sentences for certain nonviolent drug crimes, warned it would benefit “a highly dangerous cohort of criminals.” While there’s been growing support for criminal justice reform among Republicans in recent years, Sessions has generally opposed such measures. Grassley said during a markup hearing that while he considered Sessions a friend, he was “really irritated that he would send that letter.” He noted his support for Sessions through the confirmation process as well as when the attorney general has been targeted by President Donald Trump.“The president was going to fire him last spring and I went to his defense,” Grassley said. (Though it has been widely acknowledged that Sessions wrote a resignation letter, the Justice Department has taken the position that admitting that Sessions authored a resignation letter would violate his personal privacy.) “It was almost as if it was Senator Sessions being back on this committee, and not [Attorney] General Sessions. That’s a problem. He is now the attorney general and is charged with executing the laws that Congress passes, not interfering with the legislative process,” Grassley said.If Sessions wanted to be involved in marking up legislation, Grassley said, “maybe he should have quit his job and run for the Republican Senate seat in Alabama.” That was a reference to the fact that the Republican nominee ― who was accused of sexual misconduct ― lost to a Democrat.A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment on Grassley’s remarks.Ryan Reilly is HuffPost’s senior justice reporter, covering federal law enforcement, criminal justice and legal affairs.

The music’s bumping a bass beat thick enough to rearrange internal organs, and the crowd throws up hands every time the DJ calls out MONSTER BLOCK or SUPER SLAM.Oh, and it’s a balmy 35 degrees out. Perfect volleyball weather, right?Beach volleyball has become one of the marquee events of the Summer Games, and now comes its snowy cousin with an eye on carving out a little slice of the wintertime sports pie. Snow volleyball isn’t anywhere near getting onto an Olympic slate, not even close, but at a demonstration event held on Valentine’s Day at the Austria House, within sight of the Olympic Sliding Centre, the energy was as high as almost any event this week.The International Volleyball Federation (FIVB) and the European Volleyball Confederation (CEV) rounded up a handful of notable beach volleyballers: gold medalists Emanuel of Brazil, Vladimir Grbic of Serbia and Giba of Brazil, as well as bronze medalist Chen Xue of China and Olympians Stefanie Schwaiger of Austria, Kim Yeon-koung of South Korea, and Nikolas Berger of Austria. The Olympians threw on some thermals, gloves, and soccer cleats, and took a turn in the snow as perhaps a hundred fans around them cheered and danced.“We like to play in the mountains, in the beach, outside, inside, with children, with men and women,” CEV president Aleksandr Boricic said after the demonstration. “With snow volleyball, we can cover volleyball every day of the year.”The purpose of this little exhibition was to show snow volleyball’s viability as a sport, and on that score, it succeeded just fine. But as an Olympic entry? That’s where it gets a little trickier.Snow volleyball demands a different set of skills than the beach version, starting with the fact that, well, you’re on snow. Attendants with rakes chopped the snow into a fine powder, but by the end of the match, the stomping players, and dropping temperatures, had pounded the snow into slick near-concrete.The altitude is a factor, as is the cold. Players in most snow volleyball events — though not this particular one — close off with a celebratory dip in a hot tub, but before then, the lower oxygen can tire even the best players.It’s because of these inescapable factors — plus unpredictable ones, like the high winds savaging the Olympic Village at the same time the volleyball beats were dropping — that organizers from the FIVB and the CEV were preaching baby steps rather than big-picture dreams, “innovation” and “possibility” rather than expectation.“What we do believe is that snow volleyball is great, it’s about engagement,” Azevedo said. “We want people to be playing volleyball. The future, who knows?” The earliest snow volleyball could realistically make the Olympic slate would be 2026, following a stint as a demonstration sport in the 2022 Games in Beijing. But even that is no sure thing; the IOC historically has sought to keep sports confined to one season. (An attempt to bring cross-country running to the Winter Games in 2008, for instance, went nowhere.) Snow volleyball does have both a strong organizing federation and a ready availability of Olympic-level players, but even those might not be enough to get snow volleyball onto the Olympic slate.In the short term, snow volleyball’s backers are focusing on smaller steps: a European Tour kicked off in 2015, and European championships will take place later this year. FIVB hopes to start a world tour in 2019, to be followed by world championships in 2020. Beyond that, well … we’ll see.Read more from Yahoo Sports:American speedskaters still seeking 1st Olympic medalThis story was originally published on Yahoo Sports."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a85fc992000003800eaf01a.jpeg?cache=MMgbu6xLCO&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Former White House adviser Steve Bannon met with Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigators for two days this week, even as he frustrated lawmakers by refusing to answer many questions posed by the U.S. House Intelligence Committee on Thursday.Republican Representative Mike Conaway and Democratic Representative Adam Schiff said Bannon, President Donald Trump’s former strategist and a key player in Trump’s 2016 election campaign, would answer only 25 questions approved by the White House.Schiff called for the initiation of contempt of Congress proceedings against Bannon. Bannon had refused to answer many questions during his first appearance before the intelligence panel on Jan. 16, and has been negotiating with members about a return ever since.Declining to discuss the weeks after the November 2016 presidential election and before Trump’s inauguration, or his own time at the White House, Bannon claimed executive privilege and special protections for presidential communications in refusing to say more, the two lawmakers said.“He did not answer all the questions we’d like answered, so there was frustration among committee members with respect to that,” said Conaway, who has been overseeing the committee’s investigation of Russia and the 2016 U.S. election.U.S. intelligence agencies determined more than a year ago that Moscow sought to interfere in the campaign.Russia has denied trying to meddle in the election. Trump, a Republican, has denied collusion between his associates and Moscow. Mueller has been conducting a criminal investigation of possible collusion between Russia and Trump’s campaign to sway the 2016 presidential election.“There was a refusal to answer any questions that would have brought out the full facts. That is not how privilege works. That’s how stonewalling works,” Schiff told reporters.Schiff said Bannon’s 25 approved questions were written to mislead the committee. For example, they included a question about whether Bannon had met with a certain person, and Bannon answered no. But when Bannon was asked if he had spoken to the same person, he would answer yes, Schiff said.Bannon’s attorney and White House aides did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Conaway, asked whether he would back a contempt proceeding, said the decision was not his to make. He said attorneys would have to consider the claims of privilege, and there would have to be discussions with House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and other officials.“I think he (Bannon) should answer our questions,” he told reporters.Trump fired Bannon, the former head of the hard-right Breitbart News website, from his White House position in August. Bannon had been a close Trump associate since he joined the Trump campaign and helped the political novice defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.Separately, three sources familiar with the proceedings said Bannon was interviewed over two days this week by Mueller’s team, which had subpoenaed him to appear before a grand jury before he agreed to be interviewed.Bannon met with the investigators for a total of about 20 hours.Reuters reported last week that Bannon was expected to meet with Mueller this week.(Additional reporting by Steve Holland and Karen Freifeld; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Leslie Adler)"

The sled threat may jeopardize Russell and Fenlator-Victorian’s shot at becoming the Caribbean island’s first Olympic female bobsledders.Kiriasis resigned Wednesday after the Jamaica Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation told her “out of the blue” that it had changed her position from driver coach to track and performance analyst, she wrote on Facebook.“(I) would have to leave the Olympic village, would lose my accreditation as part of the Jamaican team and was not supposed to have any more contact with the athletes,” she said.Kiriasis, 43, said she’d “supported the team far beyond the call of duty at all times” by securing sponsorship, equipment and the rented bobsled ― but she could not “accept to be treated the way I have been treated.”“I still do not know the reasons behind the decision of Jamaican Bobsleigh Federation and certainly will not allow to be used as the puppet on a string by the federation which have also saved a lot of money due to my commitment and contacts,” she added.The Jamaica Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation initially thanked Kiriasis on Twitter “for her invaluable contribution” to the team:But the federation’s president, Christian Stokes, later escalated tensions by describing Kiriasis as “a destructive force on the team.”“Now that she is off the team synergy is much better, tension is down and athletes are now able to focus in a much healthier environment,” Stokes told Reuters. “If you come on the team you have to be a team player. There are no gods and goddesses here,” he added.Training for the women’s bobsleigh event in South Korea begins Saturday. The opening heats begin on Tuesday.Team coach Dudley “Tal” Stokes — a member of Jamaica’s famous men’s bobsled team at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Canada, which inspired the hit movie “Cool Runnings” ― insisted that Fenlator-Victorian and Russell would still compete in Pyeongchang.“For sure we’re going to be at the top of the hill for the start of the race and we’re going to have a good performance,” Stokes told Omnisport. “What I can say is that we don’t expect there to be any changes in equipment going into the games,” Stokes added. “In the unlikely event that we do have a problem what I can guarantee is that on race day we’re going to be at the start with very competitive equipment and those girls will be ready to go.”"

But space is limited and our Early Bird rate won’t last long!”That’s right, for only $299 you too can attend the Act for America 10th annual anniversary conference. Hear so-called “national security experts” weave fantastical and hateful conspiracy theories about American Muslims. Chat about protecting so-called Judeo-Christian culture from jihad at the fancy dinner gala. Who knows ― maybe a congressman or two will show up! It’s all going down at the Hyatt Regency Crystal City in Arlington, Virginia on Sept. 4-5. And the hotel says it is obliged to host the group.“The hotel does not unlawfully discriminate against groups who wish to hold lawful meetings at the hotel,” Derrick Morrow, area vice president and general manager at the Hyatt Regency Crystal City, told HuffPost in an emailed statement.“The views and opinions expressed by hotel guests or groups do not necessarily reflect those of the hotel, its owners or colleagues.”Act for America, which boasts an exaggerated membership of 750,000 people, calls itself the “NRA of national security” and the “nation’s largest nonprofit, non-partisan, grassroots national security organization” aimed at helping “protect and preserve American culture and to keep this nation safe.”But both The Southern Poverty Law Center and The Anti-Defamation League, which track extremist groups, call Act for America the country’s “largest anti-Muslim group.” (SPLC also classifies Act for America as a “hate group.”)“There must be no room for hate at Hyatt hotels,” Scott Simpson, public advocacy director at the legal advocacy group Muslim Advocates, told HuffPost in a statement. “Hyatt’s mission statement proudly and boldly states: ‘We embrace all cultures, races, ethnicities, genders, sexual orientations, ages, abilities, perspectives, and ways of thinking.’ Yet, the company’s decision to host ACT for America– the largest anti-Muslim hate group in America – is antithetical to these stated values and the ideals of our nation.” “We urge all Hyatt employees and potential guests to be aware that their hotel will be a hostile environment during this convention,” Simpson added. Last September, Simpson and Muslim Advocates wrote a letter to Marriott International President and CEO Arne Sorenson asking that the hotel chain not host Act for America’s 2017 conference at the Marriott Crystal Gateway, also in Arlington. Other groups, including the Council on American-Islamic Relations, also publicly put pressure on Marriott. Marriott ultimately refused to cancel the Oct 2-3 gathering, offering up the same bland corporate legalese that Hyatt provided to HuffPost this week. “We are a hospitality company that provides public accommodations and function space,” a Marriott spokesman said at the time. “Acceptance of business does not indicate support or endorsement of any group or individual.”An Act for America video from May 2017, announcing that year’s annual conference. But hotels and venues have a history of canceling on extremist groups, often after pressure from anti-racist activists. In 2010, three Virginia hotels — the Washington Dulles Marriott, the Westin Washington Dulles Hotel and the Four Points by Sheraton Manassas Battlefield — canceled event contracts with the New Century Foundation, a suit-and-tie white supremacist group that publishes the racist magazine American Renaissance. (The New Century Foundation eventually held its conference at the Capitol Skyline Hotel in Washington.) Aribnb refused to accommodate racists in Charlottesville, Virginia, during the deadly white supremacist rally there in August 2017. And in October of last year, the owners of a Maryland events venue called Rocklands Farm kicked members of the National Policy Institute off its property after realizing the group was the white supremacist organization headed by Richard Spencer. Hyatt Hotels Corporation did not respond to a request for comment on whether it would host white supremacists or neo-Nazis at its hotels. Nor did it clarify what, if any, standards it has on which extremist groups are allowed at its hotels and which are not. Simpson, of Muslim Advocates, said his group is “ currently looking into all options” regarding Hyatt’s decision to host Act for America. He said he remains “optimistic that any company that claims to value diversity, as Hyatt does, will not ultimately embrace such naked bigotry.”Act for America was founded by Brigitte Gabriel, a Christian immigrant from Lebanon who has said that “every practicing Muslim is a radical Muslim,” that Muslims are a “natural threat to civilized people of the world, particularly Western society,” and that a “practicing Muslim, who believes in the teachings of the Quran, cannot be a loyal citizen to the United States of America.”In 2007, Gabriel stood behind a Marriott-branded podium during a Christians United For Israel conference at one of the chain’s hotels in Washington and said that Arabs “have no soul.” “The difference, my friends, between Israel and the Arab world is the difference between civilization and barbarism,” she said. “It’s the difference between goodness and evil. And this is what what we’re witnessing in the Arabic world, they have no soul! They are dead-set on killing and destruction.” The crowd cheered. Act for America has worked for years to spread fear of Muslims, helping promote the debunked conspiracy theory known as “creeping Sharia” — the bigoted idea that there’s a coordinated effort among Muslim Americans to subvert the U.S. Constitution and institute a brutal version of Sharia law in this country. Gabriel has also pushed the paranoid conspiracy theory that radicalized Muslims have infiltrated every level of government, including the CIA, FBI, Pentagon and Department of State.“Escalating anti-Muslim hate crimes in recent years are undoubtedly related to the fears and suspicion raised by these and other conspiracy theories,” said Tamara Sonn, associate director of the Bridge Initiative at Georgetown University, a multi-year research project into Islamophobia. “Hosting an organization that engages in such activities does not reflect well on the values of Hyatt Hotels Corporation,” she said. In June 2017, during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, Act for America coordinated “March Against Sharia” protests across the country, events that attracted neo-Nazis, white supremacists and armed anti-government militia members. Act for America did not respond to a request for comment.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story described American Renaissance magazine as anti-Semitic. Although Jared Taylor, who founded the New Century Foundation that publishes the magazine, often surrounds himself with anti-Semites, he has denounced the ideology."

The series, titled “Twenties,” stars a queer black girl named Hattie and her two best friends, who are straight, according to TVLine. In a statement to the site, Waithe said she wrote the show back in 2009. “I always wanted to tell a story where a queer black woman was the protagonist and I’m so grateful to TBS for giving me a platform to tell this story,” she said. “Queer black characters have been the sidekick for long enough, it’s time for us to finally take the lead.”Waithe, who will also serve as executive producer for the show, shared a similar sentiment with her followers on Twitter.Waithe won an Emmy last year for co-writing the “Master of None” episode “Thanksgiving” with Aziz Ansari. Her win made history as Waithe became the first black woman to earn an Emmy for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series. She was also the first black woman to be nominated in that category.The star’s speech resonated with audiences as she thanked her “LGBTQIA family.” She continued, “The things that make us different, those are our superpowers. Every day, when you walk out the door, put on your imaginary cape and go out there and conquer the world. Because the world would not be as beautiful as it is if we weren’t in it.”According to The Hollywood Reporter, “Twenties” is based on Waithe’s YouTube series of the same name. BET previously developed a pilot for “Twenties” in 2014. "

It was the second federal appeals court to find that Trump’s third travel ban was likely unconstitutional, but both rulings have been put on hold until the U.S. Supreme Court hears oral arguments in the matter this spring.The 4th Circuit’s majority opinion, written by Chief Judge Roger Gregory, represents yet another instance in which the president’s own words ― and tweets ― have hurt his arguments in court. This has happened to Trump again and again and again.The 4th Circuit found that Trump had expressed “what any reasonable observer could view as general anti-Muslim bias.” In addition to statements from the campaign trail, the opinion cited Trump’s retweets of anti-Muslim videos posted by a far-right British political party in November as well as this tweet from August:“The President’s own words ― publicly stating a constitutionally impermissible reason for the Proclamation ― distinguish this case,” the majority found.While Trump could have “removed the taint of his prior troubling statements,” he hasn’t, the court said. “In fact, instead of taking any actions to cure the ‘taint’ that we found infected [the second executive order laying out a travel ban], President Trump continued to disparage Muslims and the Islamic faith,” it said.From the opinion:Plaintiffs here do not just plausibly allege with particularity that the Proclamation’s purpose is driven by anti-Muslim bias, they offer undisputed evidence of such bias: the words of the President. This evidence includes President Trump’s disparaging comments and tweets regarding Muslims; his repeated proposals to ban Muslims from entering the United States; his subsequent explanation that he would effectuate this “Muslim” ban by targeting “territories” instead of Muslims directly; the issuance of [executive order 1] and [executive order 2], addressed only to majority-Muslim nations; and finally the issuance of the Proclamation, which not only closely tracks [executive order 1] and [executive order 2], but which President Trump and his advisors described as having the same goal as [executive order 1] and [executive order 2].The Trump administration had urged the court to disregard the president’s pre-election statements, perhaps the court said in “implicit recognition of the rawness of the religious animus” in those statements. But the government’s argument that what he said before he was elected wasn’t relevant didn’t hold up, the 4th Circuit said.“This is a difficult argument to make given that the President and his advisors have repeatedly relied on these pre-election statements to explain the President’s post-election actions related to the travel ban,” the court wrote.From the opinion:The Government does not ― and, indeed, cannot ― dispute that the President made these statements. Instead, it argues that the “statements that occurred after the issuance of [executive order 2] do not reflect any religious animus” but reflect “the compelling secular goal of protecting national security from an amply-documented present threat.” We cannot agree.“In sum, the face of the Proclamation, read in the context of President Trump’s official statements, fails to demonstrate a primarily secular purpose. To the objective observer, the Proclamation continues to exhibit a primarily religious anti-Muslim objective,” the court wrote.Read the entire opinion below:Ryan Reilly is HuffPost’s senior justice reporter, covering the Justice Department, federal law enforcement, criminal justice and legal affairs.

The “Red Sparrow” star was among 80 guests present at the comedian’s surprise wedding on Tuesday. After only a few months of dating, Schumer married chef Chris Fischer in an intimate ceremony overlooking the ocean at a house in Malibu, California.“It was beautiful,” Lawrence told Entertainment Tonight about the wedding. “It was very sudden, but it was, I was sobbing the whole ― his vows were stunning. It’s when two people really love each other and they really mean it, it shows, and it was a beautiful ceremony and an amazing time. I couldn’t be happier for them.”“Notice my shirt was accidentally undone the whole time,” Lawrence added about her outfit, which she previously wore for an event last year. “In every wedding photo all of my buttons were undone. It looks like I was like, ‘Oh, you thought this was going to be about you?’”Guests also reportedly included famous types like Jake Gyllenhaal, Larry David, Jennifer Aniston and David Spade. Lawerence and Schumer’s friendship took off in 2015 when they were spotted on vacation jet skiing together like it was no big deal and then wowed the crowd at a Billy Joel concert by dancing on the Piano Man’s, well, piano. The two are also reportedly working on a script together, which has them playing sisters. However, the bonds of friendship only go so far, as Lawrence revealed there was one thing she wasn’t down for at the ceremony. “A couple people wanted to go down and walk on the beach and I was like, ‘No. I don’t get the beach. I just don’t care,’” she said. Schumer and Fischer were rumored to be dating back in early November, but kept things under wraps until making their romance official at Ellen DeGeneres’ star-studded 60th birthday bash. Lawrence, meanwhile, recently split with her “mother!” director Darren Aronofsky after over a year of dating. "
44,POLITICS,Senate Advances Judicial Nominee Who Can't Say If Racial Bias Exists In The Justice System,Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/michael-brennan-trump-judicial-nominee_us_5a85dc8ae4b00bc49f4212ad,"""Absolutely unacceptable, if not offensive,"" said Sen. Cory Booker.",2018-02-15,"There is so much data on racial bias in the criminal justice system. Where you been, Michael Brennan?",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a85dcd32000004d00eaefef.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The Senate voted Thursday to advance one of President Donald Trump’s judicial nominees, Michael Brennan, who spent his confirmation hearing dodging questions about whether racial bias exists in the criminal justice system.Every Republican on the Judiciary Committee voted for Brennan, a white Wisconsin lawyer who is Trump’s choice for a lifetime seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit. GOPers on the committee are Sens. Chuck Grassley (Iowa), Orrin Hatch (Utah), Lindsey Graham (S.C.), John Cornyn (Texas), Mike Lee (Utah), Ted Cruz (Texas), Ben Sasse (Neb.), Jeff Flake (Ariz.), Mike Crapo (Idaho), Thom Tillis (N.C.) and John Kennedy (La.).Every Democrat voted against Brennan. When Brennan appeared before the committee last month, he bizarrely avoided questions by Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) about whether there is racial bias in the U.S. justice system. His responses ranged from saying he would “do my very best” not to be biased, to talking about his volunteer work, to saying he might give an opinion if he could have a look at the data that Booker was drawing from to say there is racial bias.Booker was dumbfounded ― particularly because Brennan, who was a state trial court judge in Wisconsin for nine years, should know there are lots of data.“You’re a judge in the United States of America and you have not looked at issues of race in sentencing and the criminal justice system?” Booker asked. “I find this astonishing.”Federally collected data is clear on the racial divide in the justice system. Black drivers, for example, are more likely to be pulled over than white drivers. White drivers involved in traffic stops are searched at lower rates than black drivers. Black people spend more time behind bars than white people for the same crimes, and black people are three times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than white people ― even though the two groups use cannabis at roughly the same rates.During Thursday’s vote, Booker said one of the main reasons he opposed advancing Brennan was because of the judge’s “insulting” and “dangerous” responses to his previous question.“To be nominating a federal judge who does not even acknowledge the persistent impact of race within our justice system and doesn’t even have a plan or thoughts on it, to me, is stunning and absolutely unacceptable, if not offensive,” Booker said.Brennan’s nomination now heads to the full Senate for a final vote.Democrats were also upset that Grassley, the committee chairman, gave Brennan a hearing at all, given that he bent the rules to do it. Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) never turned in her so-called “blue slip” to signal her support for a hearing on Brennan, who is from her home state. It’s longstanding tradition that the chairman won’t give a nominee a hearing unless blue slips are turned in. Grassley ignored that tradition and held a hearing anyway.“I think we just took a very perilous step that not only eliminates the blue slip with respect to circuit judges, but also disables the very often bipartisan committee selection process with respect to circuit judges,” said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.).Sasse accused Democrats of setting the precedent for blowing up Senate rules in 2013, when then-Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) lowered the threshold from 60 to 51 votes to advance most nominees on the Senate floor in response to the GOP’s ongoing obstruction of President Barack Obama’s nominees.“I think the things you’re lamenting are sad,” Sasse told Whitehouse. “You’re pretending it started today. It’s B.S.”But Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), who formerly chaired the committee, chided Grassley for his unprecedented decision in 2016 not to give a hearing to Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland. That, said Leahy, damaged the committee more than anything else.“I’ve served longer in this body than anybody in this room,” Leahy said. “There are some traditions in his body that we shouldn’t just toss out because of special interest groups or a Republican White House says so.”"
45,POLITICS,Trump's Budget Would End Grant Funding For State Endangered Species Projects,Chris D'Angelo,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-budget-endangered-species-state-grants_us_5a8584f1e4b0774f31d28e73,Environmentalists say the proposal would push imperiled creatures further toward extinction.,2018-02-15,President Donald Trump gestures toward Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke during the annual national Christmas tree lighting ceremony near the White House on Nov. 30.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a85a2421e000037007abcd8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is looking to zero out grant funding for state efforts to recover endangered species ― even as it has stressed cooperating with states on conservation efforts.In the 2019 budget proposal released on Monday, President Donald Trump and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke recommend allocating not a single dollar to the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund, a program authorized by the Endangered Species Act that divvies out money to states and territories for voluntary species and habitat conservation projects on non-federal land. In fiscal year 2018, the fund received $53 million in appropriations.It’s no secret that the administration is more sympathetic to business interests than endangered species. And like most environmental protections, it seems to view the Endangered Species Act ― ESA ― as little more than a regulatory burden to economic growth. But the administration has also stressed that forming strong partnerships with states and other parties is key to preventing species from going extinct.“The resources brought to the table by these partners is fundamental for achieving the conservation objectives of the ESA,” Greg Sheehan, principal deputy director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, said at a congressional hearing in July. “It’s time that we recognize those efforts and rebuild the collaborative spirit of conservation that has restored most all fish and wildlife species in America in the last 120 years.”Dan Ashe, a former director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, said the proposal to end funding for the state conservation fund is baffling, given the Trump administration’s talk about more cooperation. The ESA grants “are the principal source of support for states’ work on endangered species and for partnership between the Fish and Wildlife Service and states,” Ashe told HuffPost.To get funding, a state or territory must put up at least 25 percent of a project’s cost and enter into an agreement with the federal government. The grant monies go toward habitat restoration, land acquisition, conservation planning, research and education. In its justification for the budget change, FWS writes simply that it “is not requesting funding for these activities in order to support higher priorities.”Among the many creatures that the proposal could negatively impact is a species of imperiled Hawaiian seabird, the Newell’s shearwater. In 2010, the birds’ attraction to artificial lights brought an unpopular end to Friday night football on the Hawaiian island of Kauai. It was that year that the Department of Justice prosecuted the County of Kauai and the island’s electrical utility for violating the Endangered Species Act and Migratory Bird Treaty Act in connection with incidental bird deaths. Both ultimately pleaded guilty and agreed to implement mitigation measures. During their maiden flight from mountainside burrows, Newell’s shearwaters can confuse street and stadium lights with the moon and become disoriented. After repeatedly circling the light source, the birds often fall to the ground — a phenomenon appropriately called “fallout” — where they become easy targets for cats, mongoose and other predators. The birds have also been killed striking power lines and utility poles on their way out to sea. Once in abundance on all the Hawaiian islands, Newell’s shearwaters are now found almost exclusively on Kauai. The population has declined by an estimated 75 percent over the last two decades.Hawaii’s state government has been working with FWS for years to reduce the number of accidental seabird deaths on Kauai, in part thanks to the more than $2 million it has received from the conservation fund since 2011. The money has been used to develop and implement an island-wide habitat conservation plan to better protect Newell’s shearwaters and other at-risk species, including the endangered Hawaiian petrel. The effort has included working with county government, the island’s electrical cooperative and the state Department of Transportation to shield and dim lights and bury power lines. Officials with the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources did not respond to a request for comment. But Beth Tokioka, a spokeswoman for the Kauai Island Utility Cooperative, said the Kauai Seabird Habitat Conservation Program has been an important partner in the electrical provider’s ongoing efforts. “We are making great strides toward a long-term plan that will help improve the survival rate of these birds,” Tokioka wrote in an email. “Continued partnerships with KSHCP and others will be critical to the success of that effort.”Other recent beneficiaries of the federal grant money are the California gnatcatcher, Delhi Sands flower-loving fly, Perdido Key beach mouse and Salt Creek tiger beetle ― all on the federal endangered species list.The White House and the Interior Department did not respond to HuffPost’s inquiries about the recommendation to eliminate the grant funding for states.In its previous budget proposal, the Trump administration requested $19.3 million for the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund, which would have been a decrease of $34.1 million below the 2017 funding level. Instead, Congress allocated the $53 million. It’s unclear what changed for the administration between this year and last. And if last year was any indication, it is highly unlikely that Congress will sign off on the latest request.Doing so, Ashe said, would be “a huge step backward,” as those monies are critical both to recovering already threatened species and keeping others off the endangered list. During President Barack Obama’s time in office, “we were very proud of the record we set, that we had recovered and delisted more species than all previous administrations combined,” he said. “And that didn’t happen by accident. It happened because we applied the resources to get species over that last mile.”In July, Republicans on the House Committee on Natural Resources took up a package of five bills targeting portions of the 1973 conservation law, which they maintain is broken and in need of an overhaul. At the hearing, Sheehan voiced support for the proposals and said his goal was for the agency “to be a better neighbor and partner to the public and states.” Eliminating funding for state ESA grants runs counter to that priority.Trump and Zinke also have pegged themselves as the allies states have long waited for. During his confirmation hearing in January 2017, Zinke said his first priority as head of Interior would be to “restore trust … working with rather than against local communities and states.”“Being a listener and a listening advocate rather than a deaf adversary is a good start,” he said. That advocacy has focused almost exclusively on boosting mining and fossil fuel production, as Zinke has prioritized energy development over conservation.Tierra Curry, a senior scientist with the Center for Biological Diversity, said gutting the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund would only push endangered species toward extinction. “This is especially damaging because [the] funding is often the backbone of state non-game programs and helps animals across the country, from bats and butterflies to salmon and grizzlies,” she said in an email.Mary Beth Beetham, director of legislative affairs at the nonprofit Defenders of Wildlife, said the proposal highlights the administration’s disregard for the natural world and is yet another reason why the budget should be dead on arrival in Congress.“In our mind, this is basically a disaster for wildlife,” Beetham said."

It was that year that the Department of Justice prosecuted the County of Kauai and the island’s electrical utility for violating the Endangered Species Act and Migratory Bird Treaty Act in connection with incidental bird deaths. Both ultimately pleaded guilty and agreed to implement mitigation measures. During their maiden flight from mountainside burrows, Newell’s shearwaters can confuse street and stadium lights with the moon and become disoriented. After repeatedly circling the light source, the birds often fall to the ground — a phenomenon appropriately called “fallout” — where they become easy targets for cats, mongoose and other predators. The birds have also been killed striking power lines and utility poles on their way out to sea. Once in abundance on all the Hawaiian islands, Newell’s shearwaters are now found almost exclusively on Kauai. The population has declined by an estimated 75 percent over the last two decades.Hawaii’s state government has been working with FWS for years to reduce the number of accidental seabird deaths on Kauai, in part thanks to the more than $2 million it has received from the conservation fund since 2011. The money has been used to develop and implement an island-wide habitat conservation plan to better protect Newell’s shearwaters and other at-risk species, including the endangered Hawaiian petrel. The effort has included working with county government, the island’s electrical cooperative and the state Department of Transportation to shield and dim lights and bury power lines. Officials with the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources did not respond to a request for comment. But Beth Tokioka, a spokeswoman for the Kauai Island Utility Cooperative, said the Kauai Seabird Habitat Conservation Program has been an important partner in the electrical provider’s ongoing efforts. “We are making great strides toward a long-term plan that will help improve the survival rate of these birds,” Tokioka wrote in an email. “Continued partnerships with KSHCP and others will be critical to the success of that effort.”Other recent beneficiaries of the federal grant money are the California gnatcatcher, Delhi Sands flower-loving fly, Perdido Key beach mouse and Salt Creek tiger beetle ― all on the federal endangered species list.The White House and the Interior Department did not respond to HuffPost’s inquiries about the recommendation to eliminate the grant funding for states.In its previous budget proposal, the Trump administration requested $19.3 million for the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund, which would have been a decrease of $34.1 million below the 2017 funding level. Instead, Congress allocated the $53 million. It’s unclear what changed for the administration between this year and last. And if last year was any indication, it is highly unlikely that Congress will sign off on the latest request.Doing so, Ashe said, would be “a huge step backward,” as those monies are critical both to recovering already threatened species and keeping others off the endangered list. During President Barack Obama’s time in office, “we were very proud of the record we set, that we had recovered and delisted more species than all previous administrations combined,” he said. “And that didn’t happen by accident. It happened because we applied the resources to get species over that last mile.”In July, Republicans on the House Committee on Natural Resources took up a package of five bills targeting portions of the 1973 conservation law, which they maintain is broken and in need of an overhaul. At the hearing, Sheehan voiced support for the proposals and said his goal was for the agency “to be a better neighbor and partner to the public and states.” Eliminating funding for state ESA grants runs counter to that priority.Trump and Zinke also have pegged themselves as the allies states have long waited for. During his confirmation hearing in January 2017, Zinke said his first priority as head of Interior would be to “restore trust … working with rather than against local communities and states.”“Being a listener and a listening advocate rather than a deaf adversary is a good start,” he said. That advocacy has focused almost exclusively on boosting mining and fossil fuel production, as Zinke has prioritized energy development over conservation.Tierra Curry, a senior scientist with the Center for Biological Diversity, said gutting the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund would only push endangered species toward extinction. “This is especially damaging because [the] funding is often the backbone of state non-game programs and helps animals across the country, from bats and butterflies to salmon and grizzlies,” she said in an email.Mary Beth Beetham, director of legislative affairs at the nonprofit Defenders of Wildlife, said the proposal highlights the administration’s disregard for the natural world and is yet another reason why the budget should be dead on arrival in Congress.“In our mind, this is basically a disaster for wildlife,” Beetham said."

Both provide federal grants to states to help them improve their reporting of criminal records and protection orders to the national database for background checks, including domestic violence records. The two programs are currently budgeted at $73 million. Trump’s budget proposal for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 would slash their funding to $61 million, which amounts to a 16 percent cut.(Why do the numbers in the infographic jump around so much from 2017 to 2019? A House Appropriations Committee staffer said it’s unclear, but notes the 2017 figure reflects what the Justice Department actually spent while the 2018 and 2019 figures reflect what Trump requested.)Gun control advocates say these federal grants have been “critical funding sources” for states trying to routinely submit comprehensive records to the national background check database.“President Trump claims that he wants to build ‘a safe, strong, and proud America’ but his actions do not live up to his words,” said Robin Lloyd of Giffords, the gun safety group founded by former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.), who survived a gunshot to the head in 2011.“Instead of strengthening the nation’s background check system to make sure it effectively keeps guns out of dangerous hands, he slashed funding to this critically important system, which will significantly undermine its effectiveness,” Lloyd said.There are about 30 million reasons why Trump would want to weaken gun safety measures. That’s roughly how many dollars the National Rifle Association spent helping to elect him president. His proposed cuts are also wildly out of step with polls showing near-universal support for strengthening background checks to apply to all gun sales, not just those done by licensed firearms dealers.The president’s budget, however, is more an overview of White House priorities than it is a document that translates into law. Republicans in Congress will use Trump’s proposal as a baseline but come up with their own government spending levels when they put forward annual appropriation bills.Trump’s call for cutting funds for gun background checks comes just three months after a mass shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas, involving a gunman who was prohibited from buying or owning firearms because of a domestic violence conviction but who had a gun nonetheless because the Air Force failed to enter his conviction into the national criminal background check database. The error has prompted the Air Force to begin a review.Mass shootings are now a regular occurrence in the country ― and so is Congress’ inaction on it. There have already been 30 mass shootings and 18 school shootings in 2018. Republican leaders in Congress routinely offer “thoughts and prayers” in response to each shooting but don’t follow up with any policy changes aimed at stemming gun violence.Another mass shooting took place as this article was being written Wednesday. This one was at a high school in Parkland, Florida. At least 17 people died and many others were injured.This story has been updated with additional explanation about the infographic."
48,POLITICS,Black Activist Starts Group That Aims To Elect Progressive Prosecutors,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-activist-elect-progressive-prosecutors_us_5a85b64ee4b0058d55670e4f,Shaun King says district attorneys “are the gatekeepers of America’s justice system.”,2018-02-15,"Shaun King speaks at a rally on March 8, 2017, in Seattle.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a85b7412000002d00eaefab.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Shaun King, a prominent black rights activist and writer, announced Thursday that he is co-founding a political action committee to help elect “reform-minded prosecutors” at the county and city levels.The Real Justice PAC plans to spend upward of $1 million to support campaigns by progressives running for district attorney offices this year.The efforts should benefit from King’s enormous social media following, as well as the expertise of several veterans of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign who are the group’s other co-founders.King views the initiative as an essential new stage in anti-racism and criminal justice reform movements in the era of President Donald Trump.“No position in America, no single individual has a bigger impact on the criminal justice system ― including police brutality, but the whole crisis of mass incarceration in general ― than your local district attorney,” King said. “They are the gatekeepers of America’s justice system.”The PAC hopes to eventually also focus on electing sheriffs and judges who, among other things, would support reducing the number of people imprisoned for nonviolent offenses.The questionnaire the PAC distributes to candidates it may endorse will ask where they stand on issues such the practice of cash bail, which often deprives low-income suspects of their freedom; the use of diversion programs for drug-related crimes; and the pursuit of the death penalty, which progressives oppose.The group also will gauge how a district attorney candidate’s track record on various criminal justice issues compares with that of the current officeholder.“That’s a smarter way and a safer way for us to make an assessment,” King said. “Many people are running under the guise of being Democrats in these DA races and that has next to no value.”Another priority for the PAC is electing more women and people of color to prosecutorial posts. The country’s 2,400 district attorneys are notoriously non-diverse. As of 2015, 95 percent of them were white, 83 percent were men, and just 1 percent were women of color.King likened the complexion and maleness of the group to the population at “any golf course in America.”“I’m not saying white is evil and black is righteous,” said King, acknowledging there are examples of draconian black prosecutors and compassionate white prosecutors. “But it’s troubling when a system that primarily targets people of color has almost exclusively white men, and conservative white men at that, at the helm.”The addition of King marks something of a reboot for the PAC, which existed in a more modest form in 2017. Becky Bond, who masterminded the Sanders campaign’s digital organizing operation, conceived of the group as a way to apply the “big organizing” technique she honed in 2016 to prosecutorial elections that ordinarily receive little national attention.Last year, Bond’s group helped elect Larry Krasner as district attorney of Philadelphia, and re-elect Stephanie Morales as the commonwealth’s attorney for Portsmouth, Virginia.In its reconstituted form, the PAC has already endorsed its first two candidates, both of whom are challenging incumbent district attorneys in Texas’ March 6 Democratic primary. Elizabeth Frizell, a state district judge, is running to unseat Faith Johnson in Dallas County. Joe Gonzales, a defense attorney, is hoping to replace Nico Lahood in Bexar County, which includes San Antonio. District attorney races remain an untapped opportunity for progressive activists to leverage relatively modest resources for major policy wins, according to King.That’s because the lack of awareness of the office’s power, even in some of the most progressive parts of the country, had allowed deeply conservative or otherwise problematic DAs to serve for decades. For example, in Manhattan, Cyrus Vance Jr. ran uncontested for a third term as DA in the Democratic primary in September. When it later emerged that Vance had declined to pursue possible criminal cases against film mogul Harvey Weinstein and Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr., it was too late for another candidate to appear on the ballot for the general election.Even a minor uptick in turnout for DA races could produce significant results, King maintained.“If we can activate exciting new candidates who stand for reform, we can make changes from coast to coast,” he said.The launch of the PAC occurs at a unique moment in the evolution of both the contemporary black civil rights movement and the national discussion about criminal justice reform.The new black rights movement grew organically in recent years in response to controversial police killings of black men and women, the vast majority of whom were unarmed.The July 2014 death of Eric Garner on Staten Island after police put a chokehold on him was King’s wake-up call. The killing, which resulted in no indictments despite video footage of the cops ignoring Garner’s pleas for his life, ultimately inspired King to leave his job at an environmental organization in Los Angeles and devote himself full time to combating police brutality and racial bias in the criminal justice system.The movement for black lives has suffered a number of other frustrating setbacks, including the acquittal of, or failure to prosecute, police officers involved in the killings of black men in Ferguson, Missouri; Baltimore; and Minneapolis.Meanwhile, the election of Trump and his appointment of Jeff Sessions as attorney general have dashed hopes for bipartisan federal legislation to liberalize sentencing and decriminalize drug use. Sessions’ Department of Justice has also signaled that it will be providing less oversight of local policing practices.For King, that makes it the perfect moment for activists who engaged in street protests and acts of civil disobedience to put at least a portion of their energy into the so-called inside game of helping elect progressive politicians.“If we are perpetually on the outside, our message might be right, but it won’t have the effectiveness that it deserves,” he said. “We can mobilize in some really amazing ways locally and just get these races in the front of the mind for people so that they understand it’s everything.”"

But they sharpen a reality we must confront.,2018-02-15,"Scattered belongings remain at the site of the Oct. 1 mass shooting in Las Vegas. Just two days before, thousands of people were enjoying a concert here, when bullets began raining down on the crowd.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8523e82000002d00eaeeb8.jpeg?ops=crop_0_154_4492_2336%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"The Clark County, Nevada, coroner released autopsy reports earlier this month detailing the deaths of the 58 victims of the Las Vegas shooting on Oct. 1.The documents provide a window into the true horror of the massacre ― and of gun violence more generally. Looking through that window is admittedly uncomfortable, but doing so gives us a rare opportunity to honestly confront the graphic reality of a mass shooting. Shying away from that truth has only helped perpetuate a status quo in which many people have decided there’s nothing we can do to limit either the scope or the frequency of these tragedies. If that’s the path we continue to take, we should at least be willing to face up to the raw brutality of the incidents that we have accepted as an unavoidable feature of American life.A number of the reports were difficult to evaluate due to inconsistencies in measurement, terminology and methodology, issues likely complicated by the sheer number of cases and the many different medical examiners who conducted the examinations.HuffPost consulted with Arthur Alphin, a ballistics expert who specializes in the forensics of gunshot wounds and who has testified in a number of multiple shooting cases, to get his thoughts on a few of the cases. His comments are included in a number of the summaries below.Case #1Female Cause of death: Gunshot wound to the head.The bullet enters the right side of the victim’s head, creating multiple skull fractures and injuring multiple features of her brain, before reversing trajectory and exiting further down on the right side of her head.Case #2MaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the chest.The bullet enters the right side of the victim’s upper chest, coursing through his chest cavity and abdomen, before exiting on the lower left side of his back.Case #3MaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the back.The bullet enters the left side of the victim’s back, coursing through his chest cavity before taking a slightly upward trajectory and exiting through his left chest.Case #4FemaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the back.The bullet enters the victim’s left upper back, coursing through her chest cavity and causing injuries to the heart and lungs before coming to rest in the tissue of her right breast.Case #5FemaleCause of death: Gunshot wounds to the chest and forearm.A bullet enters the victim’s upper right chest, striking a rib, perforating her right lung, diaphragm and liver, before coming to rest in the soft tissue of her lower right chest. Another bullet enters through the victim’s back right forearm, passing cleanly through and exiting the front of her arm.Alphin believes both sets of injuries were caused by a single bullet that struck the victim on an unstable trajectory, likely because the overheated barrel of the gunman’s rifle had expanded from shooting so rapidly, sending rounds flying out more unpredictably.“Dollars to doughnuts, this is the same bullet that does all of this,” said Alphin. “The round was probably unstable, meaning it was wobbling slightly in free flight. That’s why you’ve got that slightly oblong entry wound, that indicates a bullet that was wobbling from that overheated barrel. It enters the forearm, then it goes through and has an irregular exit wound to the anterior right forearm. ... Now the bullet is beginning to tumble [as it enters her chest].”Alphin added, “I would think she was standing, she realized there were bullets coming, she put her arm up and a bullet struck her.”Case #6FemaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the chest.The bullet enters the victim’s lower right arm and passes cleanly through it into her chest, where it injures her right lung and ultimately strikes her vertebral column, shattering the bullet.Case #7FemaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the right chest.The bullet enters the victim’s right upper chest, perforating multiple features of her right lung, before coming to rest in the soft tissue of her central back.Case #8FemaleCause of death: Gunshot wounds to the head.One bullet enters the victim’s left eye, injuring her eye and fracturing her skull, before coming to rest in the muscles on the side of her head. Another bullet enters the right side of the victim’s head, causing additional skull fractures and injuring multiple features of her brain, before coming to rest in the back of her head. The victim also suffered a gunshot wound to the hand and a graze wound to the shoulder.Alphin explained how two separate bullets could have struck the victim in the head.“Both of those head wounds would be instantly fatal, which means the person would drop to the ground like a sack of rocks. There’s no way, even if the guy had kept the rifle stable and these are bullets that sequentially exited the muzzle, you’re still talking a couple tenths of a second between impacts and the body would have started to drop. I’m thinking one of these hit the victim standing and one of them hit her laying on the ground. Remember, all the shooter is doing is spraying bullets.”Case #9MaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the chest.The bullet enters the victim’s right chest between the ribs, perforating his liver, stomach and diaphragm, before entering his left chest. The jacket of the bullet is recovered in the victim’s left lung, while the bullet itself is found in the space between two ribs.Case #10FemaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the head.The bullet enters through the right side of victim’s head, fracturing the skull, fragmenting the bullet and causing massive injuries to the brain.Case #11FemaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the back.The bullet enters the victim’s right back and passes through her shoulder blade and into her chest cavity, perforating her right lung, heart and left lung, before exiting from her left chest. Clusters of cuts and bruises suggest the victim was either dragged or trampled after collapsing.Alphin believes the bullet was wobbling when it struck the victim but says it’s hard to tell from the listed measurements.“Once the bullet travels down through the lungs, that’s a fatal wound,” he said. “Trauma and internal bleeding.”Case #12MaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the chest.The bullet enters the victim’s left chest between his ribs, fracturing one of the bones and likely fragmenting the round, leading to perforations of his left lung, spleen, aorta, liver and right lung.Case #13FemaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the back.The bullet enters the victim’s left back around her sixth rib, likely fracturing a bone before passing through her left lung and piercing the major arteries of the heart.Case #14FemaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the head.The bullet enters near the top of the victim’s head, fracturing her skull and causing massive hemorrhaging of her brain. Contusions on the victim’s face were likely the result of her falling forward after being fatally struck.Case #15FemaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the chest.The bullet enters the victim’s right chest between her ribs, taking an upward trajectory through her right lung, aorta and across her midline, where it perforates her left lung and comes to rest in the tissue of her left shoulder.Alphin believes the bullet was stable in flight when it struck the victim but became unstable upon entry.“It basically hit perpendicular to the surface of the skin,” he said. “The bullet, as it’s precessing, probably clipped one of the ribs, and that’s why it’s unstable within the body and broke apart. That’s why there are fragments recovered.”Case #16MaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the head.The bullet enters near the top of the victim’s head, coursing through his brain and into his neck before coming to rest in the tissue of his right shoulder. Additional abrasions suggest the victim fell after being struck and may have been dragged or trampled after collapsing. Case #17MaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the chest.The bullet enters the victim’s left upper chest at a downward angle, where it likely strikes a bone, which fragments the round, casting pieces throughout his left chest.Case #18FemaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the back.The bullet enters the victim’s right upper back, fracturing her third rib and perforating multiple features of her right lung and her aorta before coming to rest in the tissue surrounding her heart.Case #19MaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the neck.The bullet enters the center of the victim’s neck, severing multiple vertebrae and major arteries before exiting through the left side of his neck. Abrasions on the victim’s arm and legs suggest he may have been dragged or trampled after collapsing.Case #20FemaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the head.The bullet enters the victim’s left cheek, fracturing her skull and passing through multiple features of her face before severing her spinal cord and coming to rest in the tissue of her neck.Case #21MaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the head.The bullet enters the right side of the victim’s forehead, fracturing his skull, injuring his brain and shattering the round.Case #22MaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the chest.The bullet enters the victim’s right upper chest, courses through his midline, passing through his carotid artery at the aorta and perforating his left lung before coming to rest in his lung tissue.Case #23FemaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the head.The bullet enters the right side of the victim’s head, injuring her right eye and brain before coming to rest in the left side of her brain. Another bullet enters through the back of the victim’s right forearm, injuring tissue but passing cleanly through.Case #24FemaleCause of death: Gunshot wounds to the head and leg.One bullet enters the right side of the victim’s head, fracturing her skull and injuring multiple features of her brain while shattering the round. Another bullet enters the front of the victim’s left leg, injuring tissue before coming to rest in the back of her leg.Case #25FemaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the back.The bullet enters the victim’s central upper back, coursing through her vertebral column, shattering the round and sending fragments through her aorta and into her vertebrae.Alphin says the autopsy indicates the bullet was in stable flight when it struck the victim perpendicular to the skin surface.“The bullet began to break apart fairly quickly, and it completely disintegrated upon striking the vertebral body,” he said.Case #26FemaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the neck.The bullet enters the right side of the victim’s neck, coursing through the tissue of the neck and into the upper vertebrae, where the round is recovered.Case #27FemaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the head.The bullet enters through the left side of the victim’s forehead, fracturing her skull and likely the round, before passing through multiple features of her brain.Case #28MaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the chest.The bullet enters through the victim’s right upper chest, striking his right collarbone and coursing through his aorta and left lung before striking a left rib and coming to rest in the soft tissue of his left upper back.Case #29MaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the chest.The bullet enters the victim’s right chest, striking a rib and perforating his right lung, heart and left lung before exiting his left chest. Clusters of abrasions on the victim’s forearm suggest he was dragged or trampled after being struck.Case #30MaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the neck.The bullet enters the right side of the victim’s neck, coursing through tissue in his upper neck and surrounding his vertebrae before striking his spine and coming to rest in the tissue of his left shoulder.Case #31FemaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the back.The bullet enters the victim’s left back, coursing through the chest across the midline and exiting around her right breast.Case #32FemaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the head.The bullet enters the right side of the victim’s head, fracturing her skull and injuring her brain before exiting the left side of her head. Another bullet appears to have grazed the victim’s right wrist, causing damage to the tissue.“That bullet was a .223 bullet, it was stable in flight and it was roughly perpendicular to the surface of the head,” Alphin said. “The only good thing is she didn’t suffer. She felt no pain at all. Some of those others, even though they died with the chest cavity wounds, they survived on the ground for 60 to 90 seconds, their heart continued to beat, the blood filled up into the pleural cavity and the thoracic cavity, their brain was still functioning and they knew they were dying and they were in pain. At least this poor woman, it was instant.”Case #33MaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the chest.The bullet enters the victim’s right upper chest near the collarbone, coursing along the bone and through the body before coming to rest in the tissue of his upper arm.“If a bullet enters or comes close to the long axis of a bone, the path of least resistance for the bullet is to skim along the bone, and so it actually follows the bone a little bit,” said Alphin. “As it’s dragging the side of the bullet alongside the bone that helps keep the bullet stable and nose on, and it’s easier to separate the flesh then, because it’s just being knocked away from the bone.”Case #34FemaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the chest.Bullet enters the victim’s left chest, striking and fracturing a rib, perforating features of the heart and right lung before coming to rest in the tissue of the right chest. Another bullet enters the back of the victim’s right elbow, passing through tissue and exiting the front of her arm.Case #35FemaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the back.The bullet enters the victim’s left back, coursing through her body and coming to rest in the tissue of her left breast.Case #36MaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the head.The bullet enters the right front of the victim’s head, injuring multiple features of the brain and coming to rest in the back of his cranial cavity. Another bullet enters through the victim’s lower leg, injuring tissue and coming to rest in the calf muscle.Case #37FemaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the head.The bullet enters the back of the victim’s head, damaging multiple features of her brain and causing bruising around her eye. Abrasions on the victim’s forehead and extremities were likely suffered when she collapsed in the moments after she was shot.Alphin explained why victims who have been shot in the head with military-style rifles, which typically shoot bullets around three times as fast as a handgun, will often have bruising around the eyes.“It’s very, very common that the eyelids will be bruised, because the eyeball was trying to be forced out of the head,” he said, adding that it’s even possible for these wounds to lead to the eyeball being ejected from the socket.Case #38MaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the chest.The bullet enters the victim’s right chest, coursing through tissue, striking the right collarbone and perforating his right lung. Abrasions on the victim’s face and arms suggest he collapsed and may have been dragged or trampled.Case #39MaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the back.The bullet enters the victim’s left upper back, coursing through tissue, striking a rib, perforating the left lung, heart and right lung before coming to rest in the tissue of the right chest wall.Case #40FemaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the chest.The bullet enters the victim’s right chest between ribs, perforating multiple features of her right lung, her right diaphragm and liver before striking a vertebra and coming to rest in the soft tissue of her back. Abrasions on the victim’s body were likely suffered after she was shot.Case #41MaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the chest.The bullet enters the victim’s right upper chest near the shoulder, perforating his right lung, aorta and left lung, before coming to rest in the soft tissue between ribs in his left chest.Case #42MaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the head.The bullet enters the right side of the victim’s forehead, fracturing the skull, fragmenting the round and injuring multiple features of his brain.Case #43FemaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the chest.The bullet enters the left chest, perforating her left lung, heart, right lung and striking a right rib before coming to rest in the soft tissue of her right armpit. Abrasions and contusions to the face and extremities suggest the victim collapsed and may have been trampled or dragged after being struck.Case #44FemaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the chest.The bullet enters the victim’s right chest, coursing through tissue, perforating her right lung, heart and left lung before exiting through her left back.Case #45FemaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the chest.The bullet enters the victim’s right lower arm, passing cleanly through the tissue and exiting, before re-entering and re-exiting her arm and re-entering the victim’s body through her right chest. The bullet then courses through the victim’s diaphragm, strikes a rib, perforates her liver and strikes her spine before coming to rest near her lower vertebrae.Alphin believes the bullet was unstable and tumbling when it struck the victim’s arm, which helps explain the strange path of the wound.“I’m thinking that this person had their arm up at the shoulder but bent back at the elbow, as if scratching their ear or trying to shield their eyes or keep a hat from flying off their head.”Case #46MaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the head.The bullet enters the right side of the victim’s forehead, injuring multiple features of his brain and ejecting a fragment of the bullet from the right side of his head. Case #47MaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the back.The bullet enters the victim’s left lower back, coursing through tissue and entering the abdominal cavity before perforating his left kidney and left adrenal gland and casting fragments of the bullet along the wound path.Case #48FemaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the back.The bullet enters the victim’s left mid-back, perforating her spine and coming to rest in her right chest cavity. Rib fractures suggest CPR was attempted at some point after she was shot.Case #49FemaleCause of death: Gunshot wounds to the back.Two bullets enter the victim’s left lower back in close proximity, coursing through tissue and striking the lower spine, resulting in multiple fractures and shattering one of the rounds. The other bullet continues to course upward through the victim’s right lung before coming to rest in the right chest cavity.Case #50FemaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the back.The bullet enters the victim’s right chest, injuring vital structures in the chest cavity and coming to rest in the tissue of the right back.Case #51FemaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the head.The bullet enters near the top left of the victim’s head, fracturing her skull, fragmenting the round and injuring multiple features of her brain before exiting the right side of her head. Case #52FemaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the back.The bullet enters the victim’s left upper back, fracturing a rib and perforating her left lung before coming to rest in the space between two of her vertebrae.Case #53FemaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the chest.The bullet enters the victim’s left upper chest near her collarbone, coursing through her chest cavity and exiting her back right shoulder.Case #54FemaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the leg.The bullet enters the victim’s right leg at the side of the knee, exiting slightly higher on the back of her right leg. The victim’s body is received with a tourniquet, suggesting a bystander attempted to stop the bleeding. Contusions and abrasions to the victim’s face, arms and legs suggest she may have been dragged or trampled after collapsing.Alphin believes the victim was lying on the ground when she was struck.“It’s very common with a bullet near the knee is that, as it breaks the knee and the tibial plateau ― that wider upper part of the tibia bone and lower end of the femur ― almost invariably a bullet doing that will sever the arteries and the veins that run through that part of the leg in order to feed blood to the calf and the foot. ... It probably hurt like hell. She may not have even known she was bleeding to death. Not uncommon. She feels down there, there’s a wound, there’s a little blood coming out. She says she’s hit. Ninety seconds later, she’s dead.”Alphin added that the tourniquet may have been a sign that a veteran of either the Iraq or Afghanistan war attempted to stem the bleeding following a treatment protocol that has come back into favor in the U.S. military.Case #55FemaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the back.The bullet enters the victim’s left upper back, perforating her lung and heart, where it comes to rest.Case #56MaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the head.The bullet enters the top left of the victim’s head, fracturing his skull and injuring multiple features of the brain, where it comes to rest.Case #57FemaleCause of death: Gunshot wound to the back.The bullet enters the victim’s central upper back, coursing through her spine and chest cavity, before coming to rest in the tissue of her chest. Additional lacerations and abrasions of the face, legs and arms suggest the victim may have been trampled or dragged after collapsing.“As soon as the bullet gets through the skin and the subcutaneous, it strikes the spine, which destroys the spine, sends fragments through into the lungs and basically destroys the bullet,” said Alphin. “And that’s why you’ve got fragments that exit the thoracic cavity. There’s enough velocity in those fragments that they hit the far rib cage wall and are found.”Case #58MaleCause of death: Gunshot wound of the head.The bullet enters the top left of the victim’s head, fracturing his skull and injuring multiple features of his brain before exiting near the entry wound."

In the wake of Wednesday’s mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in South Florida, Black made a poignant observation that connected the dots between America’s gun violence epidemic and toxic masculinity. “Deeper even than the gun problems is this: boys are broken,” Black tweeted on Wednesday evening. “Until we fix men, we need to fix the gun problem.” At least 17 people were killed and 15 injured when a gunman opened fire with an assault-style rifle at the South Florida high school on Wednesday afternoon. The attack is the 17th school shooting in 2018 alone. The suspect, 19-year-old former student Nikolas Cruz, is now in custody. A 17-year-old student named Victoria Olvera told The Associated Press on Thursday that Cruz had been abusive to his ex-girlfriend and was later expelled for getting into a fight with his ex’s boyfriend. Math teacher Jim Gard told The New York Times that students had told him Cruz had been obsessed with a female student “to the point of stalking her.”As gun violence becomes more and more common in the U.S., there seems to be one constant: The majority of shooters are men, many of whom have a track record of physically abusing the women in their lives. Black noted that strict gender roles are quite literally killing people. “The last 50 years redefined womanhood: women were taught they can be anything. No commensurate movement for men who are still generally locked into the same rigid, outdated model of masculinity and it’s killing us.” he said.“If you want to hurt a man, the first thing you do is attack his masculinity. Men don’t have the language to understand masculinity as anything other than some version of a caveman because no language exists,” Black said. Read Black’s full tweet thread below. Melanie-Angela Neuilly, a professor in the Department of Criminal Justice and Criminology at Washington State University, connected toxic masculinity to gun violence in a conversation with HuffPost in 2016. “We raise our boys with an acceptance that violence will be part of their behaviors (‘boys will be boys’), while teaching them to repress all feelings except for anger (‘boys don’t cry’), in a society which objectifies girls and women,” she said. “While problematic in and of itself (‘patriarchy hurts men too’), we see that abusers overwhelmingly come from abusive backgrounds, and thus only replicate patterns they have learned during their childhoods, patterns which, while criminal, are ultimately reinforced in a number of ways in a masculine culture of violence.”"

Trump’s legal team and Clifford initially denied both the affair and the payment. In 2011, In Touch said, Clifford told the tabloid she’d had sex with Trump in his Lake Tahoe hotel suite in the summer of 2006, the year after Trump had married his third wife, Melania Knauss, and just months after she gave birth to their son, Barron."

Shulkin and his chief of staff committed ethics violations that saddled taxpayers for extravagances on a trip to Europe last summer, according to an inspector general’s findings released Wednesday.Shulkin’s 10-day trip to London and Copenhagen was planned under the guise of business travel, but involved only 3-1/2 working days, according to the report. He effectively used a VA subordinate as “a personal travel concierge” to plan leisure activities, and improperly accepted free tickets to the Wimbledon tennis match, the report said.Shulkin’s chief of staff, Vivieca Wright Simpson, doctored language in an email from another VA official to falsely convince government ethics officials that Shulkin was receiving an award from the Danish government, according to the inspector general. She used that lie as justification for Shulkin’s wife, Merle Bari, to be included in the trip, said the report, which noted investigators found no evidence that Shulkin knew about the falsehood.Shulkin is among five current or former Cabinet members under President Donald Trump who have come under investigation by their agencies’ inspectors general over taxpayer-funded travel. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price resigned last year after billing taxpayers more than $1 million for military and private flights, and Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt this week claimed security concerns force him to stick taxpayers for his first-class travel. Questions about Shulkin’s Europe trip were first raised in September by The Washington Post. The VA probe recommends that Shulkin reimburse the government for more than $4,000 spent on his wife’s airfare. VA press secretary Curt Cashour said Shulkin’s office is still reviewing the report. “Accountability and transparency are important values at VA under President Trump, and we look forward to reviewing the report and its recommendations in more detail before determining an appropriate response,” he said in a statement to HuffPost. Investigators also found that Shulkin misused VA resources by instructing a VA program specialist to work with his wife planning several days of leisure activities, including tours of palaces, an impromptu dinner in Sweden, a river cruise and several other high-priced excursions. “Personal conveniences” added more than $15,000 to the cost of the trip, including last-minute flight changes to avoid longer layovers and a flight change so that Shulkin and his wife could attend Wimbledon with expensive tickets gifted to them by Victoria Gosling, a U.K. woman involved in several sports governing bodies, the inspector general found. Shulkin claimed Gosling is his wife’s friend, which would allow for a “personal friendship” exception to the rules against accepting such gifts. But investigators found Gosling said she didn’t even know the name of Shulkin’s wife. The report recommends that Shulkin reimburse Gosling for the tickets. The trip in total cost the VA at least $122,334, the report found. Because Shulkin’s team failed to properly document expenses, the investigators couldn’t fully assess how much of the spending was misused. The investigators concluded that the VA should audit all of the trip’s expenses.UPDATE: Feb. 16 ― Shulkin said on Thursday that he would reimburse the government for his wife’s travel costs and make a contribution to the treasury matching the cost of the Wimbledon tickets, The Wall Street Journal reported. He noted that he had already spoken to President Donald Trump and plans to speak with other White House officials."
53,POLITICS,Second Judge Blocks Trump Decision To End Deportation Relief For Dreamers,Roque Planas and Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/daca-dreamers-second-judge-injunction_us_5a8366a4e4b02b66c51301c5,The White House plan to scrap DACA isn’t going well in federal court.,2018-02-14,"DACA recipients and their supporters call for renewal of the program outside Disneyland in Anaheim, California, on Jan. 22, 2018.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a836c2f2000002d00eaec7d.jpeg?cache=6KaWAqXQHN&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A second federal judge has blocked President Donald Trump’s decision to cancel the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, dealing another blow to the president’s efforts to end protections for nearly 700,000 undocumented young people who came to the U.S. as children.The nationwide preliminary injunction issued Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis in Brooklyn mirrors a separate ruling handed down last month in California. Because the cancellation of DACA has already been halted, Garaufis’ order won’t have any immediate effect on Dreamers. But the second injunction marks a win for Trump’s opponents, who have used the courts to defend DACA, even as the White House has sought to use the March 5 deadline set by the president as leverage to win concessions on border security from Democrats in Congress. It could also complicate Trump’s own efforts in the courts. His administration has asked the Supreme Court to take the unusual step of overturning the first injunction, issued by U.S. District Judge William Alsup, now instead of letting it go through the normal appeals process.The Supreme Court could decide as soon as Friday whether it will hear the administration’s request ― unless the new injunction delays that process. As of Tuesday, the justices were only scheduled to consider a request to overturn the injunction in the consolidated case out of California, according to Karen Tumlin, legal director for the National Immigration Law Center, one of the groups suing the administration over DACA. Trump declared he would rescind DACA in September, claiming it was unconstitutional. The White House aimed to terminate the program in phases, allowing recipients whose work permits and deportation protections would expire by March 5 to apply for renewal during a four-week window, but barring all new applicants. The plan was that Dreamers whose permits were set to expire after March 5 would be unable to apply for renewal, creating that deadline for Congress to act before an estimated 1,000 people per day began losing protections.Under the injunctions, however, those who have been approved for DACA are eligible to keep renewing it until the courts decide otherwise. Because President Barack Obama created the program by executive action, Trump has the authority to scrap it. But the consolidated New York lawsuit ― which combines a case originally filed on behalf of DACA recipient Martín Jonathan Batalla Vidal with a suit filed by attorneys general from 15 Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia ― argues that the administration violated DACA recipients’ due process rights and the terms of the Administrative Procedure Act when changing the policy. The APA requires federal officials to offer a reasonable justification before changing a major policy.The Trump administration’s claim that the program is unconstitutional isn’t likely to stand up in court, according to Garaufis’ order. Trump’s decision to end DACA appears instead to be “arbitrary and capricious” and “an abuse of discretion,” the judge wrote.“The question before the court is thus not whether Defendants could end the DACA program, but whether they offered legally adequate reasons for doing so,” the order says. “Based on its review of the record before it, the court concludes that Defendants have not done so.”In a statement, Justice Department spokesman Devin O’Malley responded, “Today’s order doesn’t change the Department of Justice’s position on the facts: DACA was implemented unilaterally after Congress declined to extend these benefits to this same group of illegal aliens.”The judge did not weigh in on the plaintiffs’ argument that Trump violated the Constitution by discriminating against DACA recipients based on animus toward Latinos. Nearly 80 percent of DACA recipients are originally from Mexico, a country the president has accused of sending rapists and other criminals into the U.S.These injunctions are just a stop-gap solution for DACA recipients. Although they can still apply for renewal, it can take months for permits to be reviewed and approved, and many people’s protections are likely to lapse in the meantime. And, of course, the Trump administration is fighting to overturn the rulings and go back to rejecting applicants.The president has said he wants to help young undocumented immigrants ― and maybe even grant them a pathway to citizenship ― but only if Democrats agree to fund his southern border wall, detain and deport more children and others at the border, and restrict legal immigration. His framework for a deal is considered dead on arrival in Congress because of heavy opposition from Democrats and some Republicans to slashing legal immigration, but the president hasn’t budged."

Democrat Margaret Good, an attorney, defeated Republican James Buchanan, son of Rep. Vern Buchanan (R-Fla.), 52 percent to 45 percent. Libertarian Alison Foxall received 3 percent of the vote.“Representative-elect Margaret Good’s campaign was dedicated to the people of Sarasota County who are tired of Florida Republicans peddling a Trump agenda counter to their values,” Jessica Post, executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said in a statement. “Rep.-elect Good went door-to-door, talking with voters about affordable health care, fully funded public schools, safeguarding LGBTQ+ and reproductive rights, and protecting Florida’s beautiful environment.” The district voted for Trump over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton by about 5 percentage points in the 2016 presidential election. The special election was prompted by the August resignation of state Rep. Alex Miller, a Republican, midway through her first term. Miller won the Sarasota seat in November 2016 by about 16 percentage points. Good ran on a platform of protecting the environment by preserving Florida’s public lands, opposing use of public funds for charter schools and using Affordable Care Act funds to expand Medicaid.She benefited from the support of grassroots Democratic groups that arose in response to the 2016 election, including Sister District, which encourages liberals across the country to donate to Democrats in tight state legislative races. The organization’s volunteers raised over $34,000 for Good and placed over 25,000 calls on her behalf, according to Sister District.Republicans continue to control both of Florida’s legislative chambers. The state’s Republican governor, Rick Scott, is term-limited after two four-year terms that will come to a close at the end of 2018.Democrats have been on a roll in state-level special elections. Last Tuesday, the party picked up a Missouri House seat in an exurban St. Louis district that Trump had won.And last month, Democrats flipped a state Senate seat in a rural stretch of Wisconsin that went heavily for Trump. Republican Gov. Scott Walker called the outcome a “wake-up call.”Democrats still have a long way to go to reverse the losses they have endured in state legislatures since 2009. The party lost about 1,000 state legislative seats from 2009 to 2016.But Democrats’ recent wins in longtime Republican districts bear the markings of a forthcoming wave in the midterm elections this November."

On Monday, France’s culture minister, Francoise Nyssen, handed the paintings over to Henrietta Schubert and Chris Bromberg, descendants of Herta and Henry Bromberg, during an official ceremony at The Louvre Museum in Paris.Herta and Henry Bromberg left their home in Hamburg, Germany, in late 1938, during a period when Adolf Hitler’s anti-Semitic policies were making life increasingly dangerous for German Jews. The couple relocated with their four sons to Paris. There, they sold their art collection to help them pay to get to the United States, Agence France-Presse reports.The collection included artwork by the Flemish painter Joachim Patinir, a master of landscape painting. One of Patinir’s pieces, “Triptych of the Crucifixion,” is an oil painting depicting Christ on the cross surrounded by his followers.After the Nazis occupied Paris, the triptych was sold for a cheap price. It was reportedly destined to be added to Hitler’s Fuhrermuseum, an unrealized art museum the Nazi leader wanted to build in his hometown of Linz, Austria.The Brombergs’ Patinir paintings were discovered in Munich after World War II. They were then added to France’s state collections and remained unclaimed for decades.In 2016, France returned another painting to the Bromberg family, “Portrait of a Man,” which was created by a follower of the Antwerp artist Joos van Cleve.It’s estimated that about 100,000 paintings, drawings, sculptures and antiquities were either looted by the Nazis in France around World II, or sold by Jewish families under duress, The New York Times reports. Many of the pieces ended up in Germany. Between 1945 and 1949, more than 61,000 were returned to France. About 45,000 were reclaimed by their owners. The country has been working on handing the remaining artwork over to descendants, although not much progress has been made since the first wave of restitutions. The French government still has possession of 2,143 pieces, which are entrusted to museums like The Louvre. Last December, The Louvre opened a special exhibition space for works looted by the Nazis, in an effort to bring awareness to the issue. "

Braden is a former Major League Baseball pitcher who has worked for ESPN. He did not make the comment in question, that was done by co-host Patrick Connor.Audio of the event was captured by Deadspin. During the conversation, Connor makes reference to Kim’s 18th birthday coming up in April. He compares himself to Matthew McConaughey’s character in “Dazed and Confused,” who is famous for the line “That’s what I love about these high school girls. I get older, they stay the same age.” Connor even quotes that line.After Brody Stevens, another co-host, agrees, Connor says the following: “She’s fine as hell. If she was 18, you wouldn’t be ashamed to say that she’s a little hot piece of ass. And she is. She is adorable.

HuffPost caught up with the trio to chat about their plans for the Year of the Dog and what the holiday means to them. From collecting cash-stuffed red envelopes from relatives ― a Chinese tradition symbolizing good luck ― to chowing down on a feast of good food, the actors say the occasion serves as an opportunity to celebrate their Asian heritage. “It’s something important to us because it’s a holiday that is all about family and thinking about the future. American New Year is mostly about making promises to yourself, like resolutions, but Lunar New Year is about connections with other people,” Yang, 14, explained to HuffPost. “So everything we do is about other people, not us. Except for the red envelopes!”Like many people celebrating the Year of the Dog, the trio enjoys some classic dishes traditionally served at a Chinese family’s New Year’s table, including fish, rice cakes, and dumplings.As Wheeler, 13, noted to HuffPost, the rice cakes, called “nian gao” in Chinese, represent the phrase “nian nian gao sheng,” meaning increasing prosperity year after year. Dumplings, shaped like old gold ingots, are thought to bring fortune and prosperity to families. And fish, called “yu,” symbolize the saying “nian nian you yu,” meaning “may the year bring prosperity.”But food isn’t the only thing the three are amped up for. The actors say they love being around family and playing games with relatives.Sometimes, they reflect on their immigrant roots and the struggles that family members before them have gone through. “Without all the sacrifices my family made, I probably wouldn’t be here in America, I wouldn’t be on a TV show, and wouldn’t be talking to you,” Chen, who’s 11, told HuffPost. Yang mentioned that his grandparents worked hard to ensure his family could get a taste of the American dream.“My grandparents on my mom’s side passed away a while ago, but they owned a restaurant and worked really hard to make it over here. My mom worked at their place all throughout her childhood, and then she had to put herself through school,” he said. “But my grandparents on my dad’s side worked really hard too — also they helped their brothers and sisters come over to the U.S. My grandpa had 11 brothers and my mom had 10, and one by one, most of them came over too.”For Wheeler, he enjoys learning from his grandparents and taking in the lessons he’s taught from older generations.“My grandpa will sometimes talk about the things his family taught him to do to celebrate Lunar New Year, like the preparations and superstitious rituals that are or are not allowed,” he said. “He also talks about what his family did when he was a child and the things his parents did for him to move him ahead in life. I like listening to his stories and hope I can share with my kids what I learned from my grandpa.”Ultimately, introspection remains at the core of the Lunar New Year spirit. And the trio will be doing just that. “It’s a time for reflection, for thanking those who came before or who may have helped us get to where we are today,” Wheeler told HuffPost. “And it’s also a time to celebrate the traditions and family that make us who we are.”  “Fresh Off the Boat” airs Tuesdays at 8:30 p.m. on ABC."

Thus far, however, there’s been no real floor action at all ― and with Republican leaders saying the Senate will move on from immigration after this week, there’s a risk they’ll come up empty-handed.Senators are struggling to find an immigration proposal that could get the support of 60 Democrats and Republicans. With two self-imposed deadlines approaching, any delay could further threaten protections for Dreamers, undocumented young people who came to the U.S. as children. And without a bill, lawmakers don’t have a way to proceed. Instead of holding votes on Tuesday, senators spent the day blaming each other for inaction. “We’re going to find out real soon whether Democrats are serious, whether or not they want a solution or whether they just want a campaign issue,” Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) said at a press conference where Republican leaders criticized Democrats for blocking a vote on a Republican amendment on Tuesday.Soon after, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) accused McConnell of violating his own promises on the immigration debate.“Yesterday, the majority leader said that the purpose of this week is not to make a point, but to make law,” Schumer said Tuesday. “We couldn’t agree more. That’s why I was disappointed that the majority leader attempted to start voting today with an amendment that does absolutely nothing to address DACA, does absolutely nothing to address border security.”McConnell led off the immigration debate with a proposal on “sanctuary cities” ― jurisdictions that don’t fully cooperate with deportation efforts. That amendment would have little to do with undocumented young people who are at risk of losing protections, nor would it address the border. It’s not even on President Donald Trump’s list of demands for an immigration package. But McConnell said that Democrats could offer an amendment of their own as well.Schumer immediately rejected the idea, instead proposing to hold two other votes: one on a bill based on Trump’s framework ― which Republicans had not yet introduced ― and another on a bipartisan bill to help Dreamers and ramp up border security. He said that even if neither bill received 60 votes, it could allow them to better assess what proposals could pass. But that didn’t happen.On Tuesday evening, McConnell attempted to schedule a vote again, but was again blocked by Democrats. The Senate will pick the matter up again on Wednesday.McConnell has indicated he wants to finish the immigration debate this week, and he’s shown little willingness to give senators more time. That’s led Republicans who favor stricter immigration laws to believe they can run out the clock on the immigration debate if no proposal finds 60 votes ― meaning conservatives have little incentive to compromise and every incentive to hijack the debate with divisive issues like “sanctuary cities.”Democrats don’t want to give in on their immigration principles just to find a solution by swallowing Trump’s proposal, which would grant legal status to some Dreamers while slashing legal immigration pathways, increasing border security measures, and eliminating protections for children and asylum-seekers. Democrats realize that McConnell is trying to put them in the bind of either abandoning some principles or being left with nothing.Thus far, Democrats have chosen the latter.Trump gave a “deadline” of March 5 for Congress to act to protect young people who benefit from the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program. Each of those DACA recipients has a deadline of their own for when they will lose protections from deportation and permission to work in the U.S. But if senators can’t find a bill this week, the debate could easily get lost in the Senate calendar.McConnell says lawmakers have had plenty of time to get something ready, even though some pieces of proposed legislation from his own party had not yet been introduced. Since Trump and some Republicans are asking for large-scale changes, any legislation is likely to be long and complicated.“There’s no reason in the world why, if there is a core 60 votes to support something, we can’t achieve it in the next few days,” McConnell told reporters.The Senate did successfully open debate on immigration Monday night, but weeks of bipartisan negotiations haven’t yielded a compromise proposal. Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said Monday that he didn’t see a scenario where any of the current proposals could pass with 60 votes. The 49 Democrats in the Senate are hoping to find 11 Republicans willing to join them on a DACA proposal, but even offering significant amounts of money for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border hasn’t moved enough Republicans. Democrats clearly have some support from Republicans for extending DACA protections and adding more money for border security. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) has been clear he wants to preserve DACA, and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has been a key GOP negotiator in the bipartisan talks. But Democrats need more than just a few Republicans to pass a proposal that win over their side.Even if Democrats were able to muscle through a proposal in the Senate, the House could present its own challenges. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has said he’ll only put a bill on the floor that Trump would sign. Democrats have hoped that, if the Senate could pass a bill with 60 votes, Trump might signal some openness to the proposal and Ryan would feel the pressure to at least give the bill a vote.The idea that a bill could pass with 49 Democrats and 11 Republicans and become law doesn’t fit reality, according to Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas), who said that passing a bill through the Senate with mostly Democrats would be a “futile gesture.”If senators can’t even get the debate off the ground, however, there’s little reason to believe a famously obstinate institution like Congress will solve a famously difficult issue like immigration before March 5. That means Dreamers will begin to lose their protections in larger numbers, even if they are awaiting DACA renewal because of court rulings that temporarily reopened the program. Schumer said Democrats won’t give up if they don’t reach a solution by the end of the week. “We’re going to keep fighting in every way we can,” Schumer said. "

The couple, already parents to daughter Luna, announced they were expecting a baby boy following a stunning appearance at the Grammy Awards in January.

Is he planning something against Ryan?,2018-02-14,"Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) is seen in the Capitol on Jan. 20, 2018.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a84b8ff210000c30060142a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― As senators get closer to producing a bipartisan immigration bill, House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) is warning Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) to think twice about putting whatever comes out of that chamber on the House floor.Meadows seemed to put the speaker on notice Wednesday morning during the monthly Conversations with Conservatives event, telling reporters that while he doesn’t “really” think there are any conversations happening about a new speaker, “there are certainly new conversations that would involve new leadership.”In an interview in his office Wednesday afternoon, Meadows said he wasn’t threatening Ryan, but intimated that there very well could be repercussions for the speaker if he moves forward with an immigration bill conservatives don’t like.“Immigration is a defining moment for many of our members,” Meadows said. “To not recognize that, and think you’re gonna be able to make excuses on why a bad bill gets sent to the president, is not going to be accepted by the people we represent, and certainly not going to be accepted by a number of members.”When HuffPost asked Meadows if that meant he would put forward a motion to remove Ryan ― something Meadows did in 2015 with then-House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) ― if Ryan put up an immigration bill largely relying on Democrats, Meadows said he had not “entertained putting in a motion to vacate in well over two and a half years.”Did he know of any other members who have entertained that idea?“I have certainly not encouraged other members who have mentioned that,” Meadows said. “How’s that?”Ryan’s office declined to comment for this story.Meadows seems to want to avoid a direct threat to Ryan, preferring to speak of general repercussions in November if Ryan passes a bill addressing the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals immigration program that some Republicans deem insufficiently conservative. When asked whether there would be immediate repercussions, Meadows was silent for a moment before saying, “November.”But it’s difficult to hear Meadows’s cryptic warnings and not think Ryan may have more trouble with the Freedom Caucus and other conservatives than he previously anticipated.The North Carolina Republican spoke at length Wednesday about general frustrations with Ryan regarding the latest budget deal and the speaker’s less than stellar record of an open process.“Leadership continues to have one agenda that gets communicated to a certain group of people, and another agenda that gets communicated to a different group of people,” Meadows said. “And ultimately, we would all be better served if we were just open and transparent about the negotiations that are going on.”Meadows claimed he had heard the budget deal numbers for roughly two months ― indeed, speaking to HuffPost in late December, Meadows correctly predicted exactly what the numbers would be ― and said leadership wouldn’t confirm the spending increases until the very last minute.Meadows said leadership has used an “open process when it’s convenient, and a closed process when it’s not.”But that approach itself is similar to what Meadows and other conservatives would take. Meadows wants to make sure Republicans can get votes on amendments when it’s advantageous to them, but they want to prevent votes on amendments and bills when it’s not in their favor ― like with an immigration proposal that could pass the House with all Democrats and the support of a small number of Republicans.Meadows acknowledged what he and other conservatives want isn’t a true “open process.” But he argued that Republicans should abide by the informal convention of only giving votes to legislation that has the support of a majority of the majority ― the so-called Hastert Rule ― a promise Ryan made to the Freedom Caucus for any immigration bill when he became speaker in 2015.“There is not a bill that would garner the majority of the majority other than Goodlatte,” Meadows said, referring to the hard-line immigration measure proposed by Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.).Conservatives feel GOP leaders have made less than a full effort to secure support for that legislation, despite promises during one of the continuing resolution fights that leadership would whip the bill and put it up for a vote.Leadership is currently whipping that Goodlatte bill, but it faces an uncertain fate in the House, as almost every Democrat is certain to vote against it, along with a number of Republicans.Meadows argued that if leadership’s job depended on getting 218 votes to pass the Goodlatte bill, they would indeed get to 218. “But their job does not depend on that, and so whipping that bill has been less than a priority for our leadership team,” he said.Leadership has certainly been slow to whip the bill ― something they told the Freedom Caucus they would do the week after conservatives voted for a bill to keep the government open in January ― but Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) has made an effort in recent days to at least seem like he’s pushing for passage of the Goodlatte proposal. Scalise aides note they’ve been holding member briefings, and have been getting member feedback for weeks.Ryan has also been careful to not anger conservatives worried about immigration. He’s avoided promising Democrats that he’ll put up a bill just because it passes the Senate or could pass the House. Ryan’s standard, stated over and over again, is whether President Donald Trump will sign it.On that front, conservatives seem to worry Trump could be talked into supporting a bill that has limited GOP support ― out of a desire to secure funding to build a border wall and to provide a legislative fix for DACA. They also worry that Ryan will use Trump’s support to put up a bill that has less than the support of a majority of the majority.Thus far, though, there’s been little movement on any sort of immigration bill like that. The Senate can’t find 60 votes for the sort of proposal that all Democrats would support, and without Senate action, there’s little threat of the House moving forward. Ryan’s job may be safe by virtue of inaction.But if the Senate could get its act together, and if Trump decided to support a bill coming out of the Senate and Ryan put it on the floor, there very well could be repercussions for the speaker before November.Asked if he anticipated someone else putting forward a motion to vacate, Meadows replied: “I’m only one member.”"

They’re calling it bike equity.,2018-02-14,"<p>Indego is a bike-share program in Philadelphia. The city has been promoting so-called bike equity to ensure that all residents have access to bike sharing, including discounts on memberships for low-income riders. Other cities have similar programs. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8475f321000034006013c0.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Teresa WiltzBike sharing may be the ultimate symbol of gentrification, the province of avocado-toast loving, espresso-swilling — and mostly white — millennials.But some cities are taking measures to combat that, by making it easier for low-income riders and those without a credit card or smartphone to take a two-wheeler for a spin.They’re calling it bike equity, and to achieve it, cities are trying a number of things: steeply discounted memberships for food stamp recipients; bike-riding classes; pay stations that accept cash; and recruiting riders from underserved neighborhoods.Bike equity sounds like a buzzword, but research shows it has its advantages: Bike sharing can bring disadvantaged communities a reliable — and healthy — alternative to mass transit, according to a June report by Portland State University in Oregon.The interest is there, too: Most low-income people of color said they would like to bike share, the report found, but the high cost of membership, as well as worries about traffic safety, stopped them.Ten years ago, Washington, D.C., was the first U.S. city to roll out a bike-share program. The idea was to provide tourists and locals with a fun way to get around while reducing congestion and improving air quality. Other cities, including Boston, Denver and New York, soon followed.But only years later did most cities start trying to woo diverse riders. Boston started its bike-share program in 2011, but just last month began offering steep discounts to food stamp recipients.PushbackBut the bikes haven’t been universally welcomed, and in some places it took a while for organizers to set up programs for low-income users, inflaming tensions over an amenity that many say smacks of gentrification. In San Francisco, for example, bike sharing has met with fierce opposition.The city’s bike-share program, which includes San Jose and the East Bay area, started in 2014 but didn’t offer discounted rates for low-income riders until early 2017.Last summer, community activists successfully blocked bike-share stations in the city’s Mission District, a historic, predominantly Latino neighborhood, because, they said, the program didn’t do much for their community, fueled gentrification, and didn’t include them in the plans.Locals can save money by buying a bike for $65, said Erick Arguello, president of Calle 24 Latino Cultural District. “These are amenities that are benefiting people who are gentrifying the neighborhood.”Michael Tanner, a senior fellow with the libertarian Cato Institute, called discounted bike-share programs a waste of money and “yuppie do-gooderism.” Far better, he said, would be to help lower-income people get what they really need: affordable housing in rapidly gentrifying neighborhoods.Bike EquityPhiladelphia was the first U.S. city to incorporate bike equity into its planning from the start, said Steve Taylor, spokesman for the League of American Bicyclists, a biking advocacy group based in Washington, D.C.Waffiyyah Murray, program manager of Philadelphia’s Better Bike Share Partnership, said city officials took note of how other places had been slow to include underserved communities. “Equity has to be the focal point,” she said.In 2015, the city rolled out its Indego bike-share, installing 20 stations in underserved communities and offering a cash payment option, and then in 2016 adding a discounted pass for people who receive public assistance. The city even offered a digital literacy and safe bike riding course: Digital Skills and Bicycle Thrills.It can be difficult to measure the costs of the programs, however. There’s very little data, said Nathan McNeil, the urban studies researcher at Portland State University who authored the June report.Indego relies on a combination of grants and corporate sponsorship plus membership fees, but Murray was unable to say what it costs each year for Philadelphia to provide its Access Pass to low-income users because, she said, discounted members are part of the overall operations budget. And though the city received a grant from the Better Bike Share Partnership to run its discounted pass program, Murray said the grant funders wouldn’t allow the city to disclose the amount.(Philadelphia Deputy Managing Director Mike Carroll last year announced a $2.5 million grant from the JPB Foundation to the partnership to promote bike-share equity, following a $5.8 million grant to the city in 2014.)Since its launch, Indego users have logged nearly 2 million rides. Ten percent of the rides were by the more than a thousand low-income riders who receive public assistance and have signed up for the Access Pass. Indego sold 975 of the access passes in 2017 alone, surpassing their expected goals by 30 percent, Murray said.“We’re definitely proud of that,” Murray said. “And the number is growing.”The Better Bike Share Partnership, the coalition that launched Indego, has given grants ranging from $10,000 to $75,000 to other cities, including Atlanta, Los Angeles and Milwaukee, to set up similar programs or to reach low-income communities.Barriers to RidingIt’s taken a while to get to this point. The first bike-shares were set up in more affluent, predominantly white neighborhoods, such as the Wall Street area in lower Manhattan, said Nathan McNeil, the urban studies researcher at Portland State University who authored the June report.To some degree, he said, this made sense. Cities investing in bike-share programs wanted to demonstrate that they could be successful. Starting with high-traffic areas that attract tourists is a way to ensure that more people ride.But that approach contributed to the perception that bike sharing wasn’t for everyone, McNeil said.Last year, McNeil and a team of researchers surveyed residents living near bike-share stations in traditionally low-income communities in Brooklyn, Chicago and Philadelphia. About a quarter of people surveyed said they worry that bike sharing spells greater gentrification — and getting priced out of the neighborhood, he said.Cost was a factor too, the report found, but discounts provided a big incentive for joining. Once people did join, they bike share just as often as higher-income riders.The survey found that the biggest barrier to bicycling in general, regardless of race or income, was concern about traffic safety. To remedy this, cities have to create bike lanes so that riders feel safe, McNeil said, and need to educate potential riders about riding through urban streets.Expanding AccessThis year in Boston and neighboring Brookline, Cambridge and Somerville a program started offering discounts to food stamp recipients. The Snap to Ride program offers beneficiaries of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, a $5 a month membership and a $50 a year membership. (The normal annual rate is $99.)The metro area’s bike-share, called Boston Hubway, previously offered discounts to people in public housing. With that program, about 800 out of 15,000 annual riders received financial assistance. With the new Snap to Ride program, it’s expected that 10 to 15 percent of the riders will be low-income, said Benjy Kantor, senior marketing manager with Motivate, a national bike-share operator which manages the Boston Hubway.The Bay Area in California has a similar program for food-stamp eligible riders, as do Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., and Montgomery County, Maryland.Meanwhile, Chicago and Portland offer discounted monthly memberships for low-income riders.Those who run the programs said it’s hard to estimate how much it takes to provide low-income access, but among the costs are marketing expenses. In Portland, for example, the Better Bike Share Partnership in 2016 gave the city a $75,000 grant to reach low-income communities and provide discounted memberships in the program’s first year.Typically, bike-shares run as a nonprofit-public hybrid, funded by a combination of federal and philanthropic grants and corporate sponsorship. When offering discounted bike-share memberships, cities typically don’t incur up-front costs, Kantor said. Cities may end up paying in other ways, such as repairing wear and tear on bikes, he said.But even with discounted rates, not everyone is taking advantage of them. For example, D.C.’s Capital Bikeshare provides discounted memberships to community organizations in the region. But several of the community partners told Stateline that most of their clients don’t take advantage of the program.Gearin’ Up Bicycles, a D.C. nonprofit that works with underprivileged youth, pays for the bike-share memberships so that participants can bike share for free, according to executive director Sterling Stone.“But they’re not jumping on it,” Stone said. He expected at least 15 people would sign up, but only six are enrolled, he said.New Life, New RideBike sharing has helped Maria Teresa Llanos and her husband settle into their new life in the United States after immigrating from Venezuela.Llanos and her husband were relieved to hear that the school where they’re learning English, Carlos Rosario International Public Charter School, provides students with a discounted bike-share pass, $5 for a year.The only problem: The last time she was on a bike, she was 12.“I needed to start again,” Llanos said, “learn to ride a bike, learn a new career, learn a new language.”Today, she says, she and her husband bike share to class. They even use it for their new photography business. She figures she saves at least $40 a week on transportation.In May, Detroit rolled out its MoGo bike-share program, modeled closely after Indego. In the years leading up to its launch, the city worked closely with Philadelphia officials, said Lisa Nuszkowski, founder and executive director of MoGo Detroit Bike Share. Detroit offers $5 annual memberships to anyone receiving state benefits, and riders can attend free how-to classes.Bike sharing “isn’t going to be the panacea for everything,” Nuszkowski said. “But it can be one component of a transportation ecosystem.”The city has logged 113,000 rides to date, exceeding its initial ridership goal, Nuszkowski said, and 18 percent of its monthly and yearly members are low-income riders. Today, she said, the program has bike-share users from every ZIP code in the city, a sign that the outreach is working.“We wanted to make sure we weren’t dropping a shiny new toy on the city and saying, ‘you’re welcome, everyone,’ ” Nuszkowski said. “To be successful, it really has to be reflective of the city we serve.” Stateline home pageSign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research "

It also reflects a major blow to 21st Century Fox, the longtime home of many of Murphy’s hallmark series over the last decade.“Ryan Murphy’s series have influenced the global cultural zeitgeist, reinvented genres and changed the course of television history,” Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said in a statement about the hiring. “His celebrated body of work and his contributions to our industry speak for themselves, and we look forward to supporting Ryan in bringing his broad and diverse stories to the world.”In his own statement, Murphy said he planned to continue to “champion women, minorities and LGBTQ heroes and heroines” in his new body of work when he starts in July after his current contract expires. Netflix said two new series, “Ratched” and “The Politician,” will premiere soon after.“The history of this moment is not lost on me,” Murphy said in a statement. “I am a gay kid from Indiana who moved to Hollywood in 1989 with $55 in savings in my pocket, so the fact that my dreams have crystallized and come true in such a major way is emotional and overwhelming to me.The move is the latest star hire by the streaming behemoth in the past six months. In August, the company poached Shonda Rhimes, the creator of “Scandal” and “Grey’s Anatomy,” away from ABC. Her four-year deal was reportedly worth $100 million.Netflix said in October that it planned to spend up to $8 billion on original content in 2018 in an effort to make its vast arsenal of movies and television shows 50 percent original programming. The company has steadily been increasing its subscriber base, and as of mid-January it had more than 117 million monthly customers.Murphy will continue to produce shows for 21st Century Fox, where he has nearly a half-dozen series currently in production, including “American Crime Story,” “Feud” and a new drama called “Pose,” about the vogueing scene in 1980s New York City.Netflix welcomed Murphy on Twitter shortly after the news was made public."

A string of trips last June cost taxpayers more than $90,000 in total, according to agency receipts the Environmental Integrity Project obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests.Pruitt said Tuesday that his protective detail and his chief of staff made the bookings based on security assessments, and said there was a string of incidents last year that spurred his frequent use of first-class seats. It was not immediately clear what these incidents involved, and the EPA did not reply to HuffPost’s request to clarify what they were.“We live in a very toxic environment politically, particularly around issues of the environment,” Pruitt told the Union Leader. “We’ve reached the point where there’s not much civility in the marketplace and it’s created, you know, it’s created some issues and the (security) detail, the level of protection is determined by the level of threat.”“I’m not involved in any of those decisions,” he continued. The Union Leader noted that Pruitt traveled to New Hampshire via a first-class flight from the Washington, D.C., area to Boston.The EPA defended Pruitt’s travel in an interview with The Washington Post on Sunday, saying ethics officials had approved the expenses. Federal regulations state that government employees must “consider the least expensive class of travel” for their needs, but security concerns do allow for more expensive bookings.CNN reported in October that Pruitt gets at least “four to five times the number of threats” as his predecessor. He’s also the first person in the role to have a full-time security detail at a cost of about $2 million a year.Pruitt’s tenure at the EPA has been controversial as he’s quickly moved to dismantle many Obama-era environmental regulations, including the Clean Power Plan. Researchers have accused Pruitt’s EPA of disenfranchising scientists on the agency’s advisory boards, and senior officials have been leaving in droves, either through buyouts or voluntary departures.On Monday, former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) called on Pruitt to be fired, calling him “the wrong person at that place,” echoing the calls of many environmental groups.But Pruitt told the Union Leader his detractors “just don’t know me.”One thing is clear: Pruitt’s use of first-class seats isn’t helping the environment. A 2013 World Bank report found that travel in business-class seats accounted for around three times the carbon emissions of equivalent seats in coach, because the seats take up far more space. First-class spots are even larger and can account for up to nine times the emissions."

Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sessions wrote that he “strongly” urged the Senate to consider the ramifications of the bill. “In recent years, convicted drug traffickers and other violent criminals have received significant sentencing breaks from the federal courts and the United States Sentencing Commission.” Sessions wrote. “Passing this legislation to further reduce sentences for drug traffickers in the midst of the worst drug crisis in our nation’s history would make it more difficult to achieve our goals and have potentially dire consequences.” The Iowa senator said on Twitter Wednesday that he was “incensed” by Sessions’ letter, saying it was not the proper role of the attorney general. Grassley said the “bipartisan compromise ensures that these consequences fit their crimes by targeting violent and career criminals who prey on the innocent while giving nonviolent offenders with minimal criminal histories a better chance to become productive members of society.”On Thursday, Grassley fumed at Sessions during a Senate Judiciary Committee markup hearing.“When I read his letter, it was almost as if Senator Sessions was back on the Judiciary Committee,” Grassley said. “But that’s the problem. He is now the attorney general and is charged with executing the laws that Congress passes, not interfering with the legislative process.” If Sessions wanted to be involved in the markup process for the legislation, “maybe he should have quit his job and run for the Republican Senate seat in Alabama,” Grassley said.Grassley said that both he and Sessions believe in being tough on crime. “But I also believe in being fair. This is a view shared by the last Republican attorney general, Michael Mukasey, who testified in support of this bill last Congress. So, we have one Republican attorney general who thinks this bill is good policy, and one who has some concerns,” Grassley said.Last week, Grassley said the bill was “stuck” without support from the Trump administration.Read the letter below.This article has been updated to include Grassley’s remarks at Thursday’s hearing."

The practice, the lawsuit argues, is in violation of the Federal Equal Pay Act and similar state acts in New York and California ― the two states where Rose lived while working for Vice from 2014 to 2016. According to the filing, Rose obtained an internal memo in 2015 showing her the salaries of about 35 other employees. She allegedly discovered that overall, the men were being paid significantly higher salaries than their female counterparts for essentially the same work. Rose says she discovered a particularly egregious pay discrepancy between herself and a male employee she’d hired. Per the lawsuit:Plaintiff hired her male subordinate, but she learned that this male employee earned approximately $25,000 per year more than her. This male employee quickly rose through the ranks and was later promoted to a position as Plaintiff’s supervisor by the male executive overseeing the Live Nation joint venture, who told Plaintiff that the male employee was a “good personality fit” for male clients at Live Nation.The lawsuit alleges that hundreds of women employed at Vice Media were affected by the equal pay violation. Rose’s lawyers are seeking class-action certification.In a statement to HuffPost, Vice said it’s still reviewing Rose’s complaint, and noted that it’s studying workplace equality concerns.“We have just been made aware of the complaint and are reviewing it,” the statement read. “As a company, we have made a significant commitment to a respectful, inclusive and equal workplace. That commitment includes a pay parity audit started last year, a goal of 50/50 female/male representation at every level by 2020, and the formation of a Diversity & Inclusion Advisory Board.”Former Vice News writer Alice Speri tweeted in support of Rose’s claims on Tuesday:In December, a bombshell New York Times report explored the toxic workplace culture for women at Vice Media. Two men alleged in the report to have engaged in sexual misconduct at work, company President Andrew Creighton and Chief Digital Officer Mike Germano, were subsequently placed on leave the following month. After the launch of an internal investigation, Germano was permanently dismissed. The company is still investigating claims against Creighton. Ahead of the Times piece late last year, The Daily Beast and BuzzFeed News also published investigations into toxic behavior by male employees at Vice Media. "

This crossroads occurs in Marvel’s newest chapter, “Black Panther,” but it feels more like a “Lion King” homage than a comic-book cliché. After the titular warrior T’Challa has been crowned ruler of the African nation Wakanda, his late father appears to him against the violet twilight, just as Mufassa materialized in young Simba’s hour of need. “I am not ready to be without you,” the mourning T’Challa tells his papa, who gently promises that T’Challa has spent his life training for this precious juncture. He’s gonna be a mighty king, so enemies beware.A mighty king indeed, one whose story vastly outshines the 22 movies and 10 television series logged since the so-called Marvel Cinematic Universe began in 2008 and the DC Extended Universe launched in 2011.Like many a franchise, “Black Panther” steeps itself in well-trod mythology ― Arthurian folklore, James Bondian valor, and, yes, a fitting dose of “The Lion King,” which itself borrows from “Hamlet.” In most instances, particularly when it comes to the mind-numbingly homogenous superhero craze, listing the tropes we’ve seen a dozen times over is a dispiriting exercise. Not here.Thanks to the careful work of director Ryan Coogler, who co-wrote the “Black Panther” script with “American Crime Story” scribe Joe Robert Cole, the movie’s familiar elements are comforting instead of tiresome. That’s because what bookends them is fresh and more invigorating than anything this genre has produced in the 21st century. Of course, a lot of that is owed to the fact that no superhero flick has ever looked like this. None has had an almost exclusively black cast, and most are likelier to take place in the far reaches of outer space or some version of New York City than they are a fictional utopia in Africa.And even the brightest spots in the Marvel and DC catalogs don’t feature characters as nuanced and interesting as the ones seen in T’Challa’s homeland, where muscular women are heroes, warring with other nations is not the answer, armored rhinos act as guards and everyone’s attire glitters so spectacularly it might as well have catwalked straight off a Wakanda Fashion Week runway.As the poised but restrained T’Challa, Chadwick Boseman, our de facto biopic master thanks to his roles as Jackie Robinson (“42”), James Brown (“Get On Up”) and Thurgood Marshall (“Marshall”), once again proves himself a sturdy leading man. He’s aided by a choice ensemble that includes Lupita Nyong’o as a charitable operative and well-rounded love interest, Danai Gurira as the captain of a female squadron, “Get Out” breakout Daniel Kaluuya as T’Challa’s right-hand confidant, MVP Letitia Wright as his quippy tech-whiz sister Shuri, Angela Bassett as his royally robed mother, Forest Whitaker as an Obi-Wan-esque archbishop who oversees the crowning of Wakanda’s monarch, and Martin Freeman as an American CIA envoy who joins T’Challa in protecting his paradise. In an inspired casting choice, it’s Michael B. Jordan, a stud among heroic studs after “Fantastic Four” and his previous Coogler collaborations (“Creed” and the fantastic 2013 indie “Fruitvale Station”), who becomes T’Challa’s foil. Sporting a mean mug and a gritty dreadlocked updo, Jordan plays Erik Killmonger, a fallen angel who returns to the birthplace that exiled him with one mission in mind: overthrowing T’Challa and bandaging the emotional scars hardening his superpower-hunting soul. Killmonger seeks vengeance that would demolish Wakanda’s isolated, technologically rich culture ― the very culture that has avoided colonialism and relieved its inhabitants of the systematic racism blanketing the globe. Jordan brings a grizzled vigor to the screen without losing what makes good villains so potent: a tangible sense of the injustices life has brought upon them.T’Challa and Killmonger’s conflict yields a smattering of battles, as is routine for any comic-book spectacle’s third act. And the action itself is far from perfect. Like too many films of this ilk, it’s smothered in gaudy computer-generated renderings and edited for maximum velocity, detracting from the intimate character beats Coogler has laid out. However judicious it is overall, “Black Panther” further proves these movies would be better with less capital. Even our craftiest filmmakers can’t resist hitting that extra VFX keystroke when allotted, in this case, a reported $200 million budget. Jumping from the lush flora and fauna of Wakanda ― that resourceful land where sunrises and sunsets punctuate unfathomable sci-fi beauty ― to the overcooked culminating fight sequences is like a rude jolt in an otherwise smooth roller coaster. (Credit for the aforementioned beauty goes to director of photography Rachel Morrison, whose work on “Mudbound” just made her the first woman nominated for the cinematography Oscar.)To its benefit, “Black Panther” isn’t overflowing with these gangbuster action scenes. In fact, a couple of its most thrilling moments are ritualistic hand-to-hand skirmishes set atop a multihued mountain where onlookers’ uniforms form a rainbow of colors.

77,ENTERTAINMENT,'Black Panther' Is What Superhero Movies Are Meant To Be,Matthew Jacobs,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-panther-review_us_5a819d48e4b0c6726e156447,"Ryan Coogler and his cast, including Chadwick Boseman and Lupita Nyong'o, manage to freshen up a genre that desperately needs it.",2018-02-14,"Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan in ""Black Panther.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a82157d1e00002c007ab7b2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"So it is written in the pop-culture bible: No heroic quest is complete without a dark night of the soul, that pivotal moment when a costumed crusader questions his or her ability to protect the world or else reaches an impasse about how to do so. This crossroads occurs in Marvel’s newest chapter, “Black Panther,” but it feels more like a “Lion King” homage than a comic-book cliché. After the titular warrior T’Challa has been crowned ruler of the African nation Wakanda, his late father appears to him against the violet twilight, just as Mufassa materialized in young Simba’s hour of need. “I am not ready to be without you,” the mourning T’Challa tells his papa, who gently promises that T’Challa has spent his life training for this precious juncture. He’s gonna be a mighty king, so enemies beware.A mighty king indeed, one whose story vastly outshines the 22 movies and 10 television series logged since the so-called Marvel Cinematic Universe began in 2008 and the DC Extended Universe launched in 2011.Like many a franchise, “Black Panther” steeps itself in well-trod mythology ― Arthurian folklore, James Bondian valor, and, yes, a fitting dose of “The Lion King,” which itself borrows from “Hamlet.” In most instances, particularly when it comes to the mind-numbingly homogenous superhero craze, listing the tropes we’ve seen a dozen times over is a dispiriting exercise. Not here.Thanks to the careful work of director Ryan Coogler, who co-wrote the “Black Panther” script with “American Crime Story” scribe Joe Robert Cole, the movie’s familiar elements are comforting instead of tiresome. That’s because what bookends them is fresh and more invigorating than anything this genre has produced in the 21st century. Of course, a lot of that is owed to the fact that no superhero flick has ever looked like this. None has had an almost exclusively black cast, and most are likelier to take place in the far reaches of outer space or some version of New York City than they are a fictional utopia in Africa.And even the brightest spots in the Marvel and DC catalogs don’t feature characters as nuanced and interesting as the ones seen in T’Challa’s homeland, where muscular women are heroes, warring with other nations is not the answer, armored rhinos act as guards and everyone’s attire glitters so spectacularly it might as well have catwalked straight off a Wakanda Fashion Week runway.As the poised but restrained T’Challa, Chadwick Boseman, our de facto biopic master thanks to his roles as Jackie Robinson (“42”), James Brown (“Get On Up”) and Thurgood Marshall (“Marshall”), once again proves himself a sturdy leading man. He’s aided by a choice ensemble that includes Lupita Nyong’o as a charitable operative and well-rounded love interest, Danai Gurira as the captain of a female squadron, “Get Out” breakout Daniel Kaluuya as T’Challa’s right-hand confidant, MVP Letitia Wright as his quippy tech-whiz sister Shuri, Angela Bassett as his royally robed mother, Forest Whitaker as an Obi-Wan-esque archbishop who oversees the crowning of Wakanda’s monarch, and Martin Freeman as an American CIA envoy who joins T’Challa in protecting his paradise. In an inspired casting choice, it’s Michael B. Jordan, a stud among heroic studs after “Fantastic Four” and his previous Coogler collaborations (“Creed” and the fantastic 2013 indie “Fruitvale Station”), who becomes T’Challa’s foil. Sporting a mean mug and a gritty dreadlocked updo, Jordan plays Erik Killmonger, a fallen angel who returns to the birthplace that exiled him with one mission in mind: overthrowing T’Challa and bandaging the emotional scars hardening his superpower-hunting soul. Killmonger seeks vengeance that would demolish Wakanda’s isolated, technologically rich culture ― the very culture that has avoided colonialism and relieved its inhabitants of the systematic racism blanketing the globe. Jordan brings a grizzled vigor to the screen without losing what makes good villains so potent: a tangible sense of the injustices life has brought upon them.T’Challa and Killmonger’s conflict yields a smattering of battles, as is routine for any comic-book spectacle’s third act. And the action itself is far from perfect. Like too many films of this ilk, it’s smothered in gaudy computer-generated renderings and edited for maximum velocity, detracting from the intimate character beats Coogler has laid out. However judicious it is overall, “Black Panther” further proves these movies would be better with less capital. Even our craftiest filmmakers can’t resist hitting that extra VFX keystroke when allotted, in this case, a reported $200 million budget. Jumping from the lush flora and fauna of Wakanda ― that resourceful land where sunrises and sunsets punctuate unfathomable sci-fi beauty ― to the overcooked culminating fight sequences is like a rude jolt in an otherwise smooth roller coaster. (Credit for the aforementioned beauty goes to director of photography Rachel Morrison, whose work on “Mudbound” just made her the first woman nominated for the cinematography Oscar.)To its benefit, “Black Panther” isn’t overflowing with these gangbuster action scenes. In fact, a couple of its most thrilling moments are ritualistic hand-to-hand skirmishes set atop a multihued mountain where onlookers’ uniforms form a rainbow of colors. Even down to those onlookers, this is far more character-driven than anything Marvel has done, and I don’t mean “character-driven” in the vein of, say, “Thor: Ragnarok,” a romp that tried oh-so-hard to reinvent the wheel via canned, quirky humor. Here, everyone is steeped in the mythos of their ancestry but committed to a more diplomatic future.

Figuring out if they're gerrymandered takes some deeper digging.,2018-02-14,"Pennsylvania Republicans drew the state's 7th congressional district to maximize the influence of GOP voters. The odd shape of the district, often referred to as Goofy kicking Donald Duck, was infamous for being one of the worst examples of gerrymandering in the United States.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8489e81e0000dc007abb7b.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In Pennsylvania, there is Goofy kicking Donald Duck. In Maryland, a “broken-winged pterodactyl.” In Illinois, there are earmuffs.To the naked eye, these districts are the smoking gun of gerrymandering. But experts say that while an unusual outline can indicate something is amiss, evaluating the unfairness of a gerrymander runs much deeper than looking at shape.The complexity of diagnosing a gerrymander is currently on display in Pennsylvania, where top Republicans released a proposed fix for the state’s congressional map on Friday. In January, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court found that the state’s congressional map “clearly, plainly and palpably” violated the state’s constitution, and the plan put forth on Friday contained districts that looked a little tidier. Goofy kicking Donald Duck was gone, but analysis of the new plan shows that the redrawn districts would benefit Republicans. Brian Amos, a redistricting expert at the University of Florida, found in his analysis that President Donald Trump would beat Hillary Clinton in 12 of the state’s 18 electoral districts ― the same results that would have happened under the old plan. Under the map currently in place, Republicans control 13 of the state’s 18 congressional seats, despite winning about 50 percent of the statewide vote. There are more than 800,000 more registered Democrats in the state than Republicans.Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf (D) rejected the Republican proposal on Tuesday, saying it still amounted to an unfair gerrymander that benefited Republicans. Now, the state Supreme Court is likely to draw a fairer map. What those maps will look like is still to be determined. To be sure, some lines will zig and zag in order to preserve certain communities. The important question is not what the districts look like, but whether there is a legitimate reason they look like that.Keith Gaddie, a political science professor at the University of Oklahoma who helped Wisconsin Republicans draw the state’s legislative map in 2011, said trying to determine a gerrymander using shape alone was like trying to diagnose cancer just by looking at one’s skin.“It can be a melanoma, [or] you could just have an ugly mole,” he said in an interview with HuffPost.Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles who closely follows redistricting issues, criticized efforts to name misshapen districts after strange creatures. He says communities just aren’t organized in neat, geometrical shapes. When you superimpose districts on a Google Map, Levitt says, you can sometimes see that they’re drawn to follow highways, rivers and other barriers that provide a rationale for why districts look really weird.“You shouldn’t only look to squiggly districts as the bad ones,” Levitt told HuffPost. “You should look below some of the good-looking ones too. And you should dig a little bit deeper into the squiggly ones to see if they’re actually bad.”To Levitt, one has to look beyond shape and to lawmakers’ rationale in order to assess a gerrymander. Advances in technology and statistical modeling now provide a powerful set of tools that can be used to study electoral districts.In Pennsylvania, for example, an expert for those challenging the congressional map used computer software to randomly draw hundreds of maps that were more fair than the one Republicans put in place. The analysis offered concrete evidence that Republicans were concerned with partisan advantage over other factors when they drew the state’s congressional map.“If you can explain why Goofy is kicking Donald Duck, and if that’s a real community with real profound distinct representational interests, maybe it doesn’t matter that Goofy is kicking Donald Duck,” Levitt said. “And if you can’t, maybe that indicates that there’s something more nefarious in mind.”During oral argument at the Supreme Court, lawyers for Pennsylvania Republicans didn’t attempt to offer an explanation for their congressional map other than partisan intent. In North Carolina, a Republican in charge of the redistricting process openly admitted that the reason they drew the map to give Republicans a 10-3 advantage in Congress was because it was not possible to draw a map that gave Republicans more seats. While partisanship underlies some of the country’s most oddly shaped districts, there is a reasonable explanation for why a district has a weird shape. In Illinois, Republicans have pointed to the earmuff-shaped 4th congressional district as an example of an egregious gerrymander drawn to preserve Democratic representation.The Voting Rights Act prohibits lawmakers from drawing lines that dilutes the influence of minority voters, and the 4th congressional district is drawn that way to preserve the influence of Latino voters, said Michael McDonald, a redistricting expert and professor at the University of Florida. The district looks like earmuffs because Latino voters live in two pockets separated by a largely African-American community, McDonald said. The odd earmuff shape ensures that the African-American voters don’t dilute the influence of Latino voters and vice versa.“The question that was faced back in 1992, when the district was first created, was, ‘How do you simultaneously give representation to African Americans and to Latinos?’ You can’t do it by just drawing a district that would be in compact form. You couldn’t do that. That would cut through the African-American community,” McDonald said. The unusual shape of the district appears to have its intended effect. In 1992, the voters in Illinois’ 4th district elected Luis Gutierrez to represent them, making him the first elected Hispanic member of Congress from the midwest.The way we draw districts is about something much deeper than shape, Levitt said. It’s about how Americans can expect their elected representatives to advance their interests. “When you only look to shape, I think you’re losing why we lose representation in the first place,” he said. “When you have a representative who’s in a legislature and they represent the tech industry, or the farm industry, or the north side of town or the south Side of town, then you can hold your representative accountable because you know what they’re supposed to be doing.”Lacking a common interest can increase partisanship, Levitt says, because people begin to fall back on party affiliation as they only way to gauge whether or not their representative is doing a good job.“When you don’t have a representative with clear communities behind them, it is much easier for them to fall back on rough proxies of Democrats or Republicans in order to figure out whether we like what they’re doing or not,” he said."

In Genesis, Abram’s name was changed to Abraham to reflect his new identity as the father of the Jewish people. And in the Christian gospels, Jesus changed his follower Simon’s name to Peter to symbolize that the apostle would be the “rock” upon which the church was built.Echoing that tradition, a Lutheran congregation in New Jersey recently marked a milestone in the life of its pastor with a renaming ceremony. On Sunday, parishioners watched their transgender pastor take on his new chosen name ― Peter.It was a sacred way for Hoboken’s St. Matthew Trinity Lutheran Church to acknowledge and bless the Rev. Peter R. Beeson’s gender transition.Beeson told HuffPost that it was also important for the congregation to demonstrate the “expansiveness of God’s compassion.”“The renaming ceremony provided an opportunity ... for us to show the broader world that there are faithful Christians who support LGBTQ+ people and offer a counter message to the one of fear and hate so prevalent today,” Beeson told HuffPost. “Particularly for people who may be pondering their gender identity or sexual orientation ― particularly young people ― this provided us an opportunity to say that God loves you, and that all people are created in the image of God.”St. Matthew Trinity Lutheran Church is part of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), a mainline Protestant denomination. The New Jersey Synod of the ELCA has a history of affirming and welcoming LGBTQ clergy members and lay leaders. Halfway through the traditional Sunday service, Beeson and the New Jersey Synod’s bishop, Tracie Bartholomew, walked over to the church’s baptismal font. Bartholomew spoke about the ways that God changed people’s names in the Bible. A church leader then asked the congregation a series of questions about supporting Beeson in his transition and being a welcoming Christian community.Bartholomew blessed Beeson with water from the font and welcomed him by his new name.“It was powerful to hear the congregation re-commit to their long history of inclusion and promise to be a safe and welcoming congregation for all people who are seeking a Christian community,” Beeson said about the ceremony.Daniel Stoll, a church council member, told HuffPost that the ceremony was “beautiful.” The church was packed with three times more visitors than is typical for a Sunday service, he said.However, Stoll said the congregation has also received “a lot of negativity” online and through office calls from those who “think they can judge for God.”“[Gay and trans individuals] have every right to be their authentic selves as anyone. God didn’t make a mistake,” Stoll told HuffPost. “Jesus teaches us to love every individual. The hate has to stop.” Beeson told HuffPost that he has long felt a calling to be a minister. Growing up, his fundamentalist, evangelical Christian parents often had missionaries stay over at the family home in Arizona. In the tradition he belonged to, women were only permitted to be missionaries or Sunday school teachers. As a child, Beeson thought he would one day become a missionary as well.Coming out as queer in his late teens forced Beeson to wrestle with his Christian faith and eventually leave his parents’ religious tradition. Years later, he said he was drawn by the Holy Spirit to return to the church. He joined an inclusive ELCA congregation in Phoenix. “With time, I fell in love with the Lutheran emphasis on grace and divine action ― that means God finds us, rather than the fundamentalist interpretation that we have to find or earn God’s forgiveness by being holy,” Beeson said.As he became more involved in the life of that congregation, the ministerial calling from childhood resurfaced. Beeson’s mentors also encouraged him to go to seminary and become a pastor.Beeson has served as pastor of St. Matthew Trinity since October 2014.He said one of his favorite passages in the Bible is the story of how Jesus broke the social norms of his time to speak with a Samaritan woman at a well. To Beeson, the ancient Bible story has personal implications.“It shows how Jesus, again and again, uses people on the outskirts of society to proclaim the message of God’s compassion and redemptive grace,” he said.

The police findings will be examined by state prosecutors and the attorney general, which could take months, The New York Times reported. In a first case, known as Case 1000, investigators have looked at whether Netanyahu accepted bribes from billionaire donors, including Israeli-born Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan. In Case 2000, Netanyahu faced claims he entered into a deal with the publisher of the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper in which he would receive favorable coverage in exchange for weakening a rival publication by restricting its circulation. Both the prime minister and the publisher, Arnon Mozes, have denied that the conversations, leaked in transcripts to the media, were serious discussions.Netanyahu has denied wrongdoing in both cases. In a Facebook video published last week in response to news of the impending recommendation, the prime minister maintained his innocence and said the investigations would turn up “nothing.”“Many of you are asking, what will happen? So I want to reassure you: There will be nothing, because I know the truth,” he said, according to a translation of his address. “I’m sure that at the end of the day the qualified legal factors will come to one conclusion, the simple truth: There is nothing.” In a follow-up statement, also posted to Facebook last week, the prime minister criticized the investigation and claimed “a great shadow” had been “imposed tonight on police investigations in the matter of Prime Minister Netanyahu.”“Any fair-minded person will ask themselves how people who say such delusional things about the prime minister can investigate him objectively and make recommendations in his case without bias,” he wrote.Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked said in August that if Netanyahu were to be indicted on corruption charges, he would not be obligated to resign.Netanyahu is serving his fourth term as Israel’s prime minister, the second time he has held the position after formerly being elected to the office from 1996 to 1999.

After all, the billionaire is notorious for her desire to expand private school choice programs (which include many religious private schools that teach Christian fundamentalist doctrine).One year into her tenure, educators have turned this opposition into action. As in so many industries and among Democrats at large, there has been a wave of activism in response to President Donald Trump in the past year. In education, this activism has manifested as a renewed rallying around traditional public schools. The Network for Public Education, an advocacy group, has seen membership shoot up to 330,000 members, compared to 22,000 members before DeVos was nominated. The previous year, membership had increased by only a fraction of that amount. And in states like Kentucky, more teachers than ever are running for office. Polls have shown a decline in support for some of DeVos’ favorite types of schools. One poll from August showed that public enthusiasm for charter schools ― a type of public school that is privately operated and often has support from both parties ― is dropping. Another poll, from American Federation for Children, the education reform group DeVos used to head, found that overall support for the concept of “school choice” has been dropping too, although it remains high. (The AFC poll defines school choice as giving “parents the right to use the tax dollars designated for their child’s education to send their child to the public or private school which best serves their needs.”) DeVos “was a wake-up call to everyone who was concerned about the future of public education,” Diane Ravitch, a former U.S. assistant secretary of education and founder of the Network for Public Education, said over breakfast in a Brooklyn neighborhood in January. “I’m actually glad [Trump] chose her.”  Ravitch, who is writing a book about resistance to school privatization efforts, calls DeVos a “blessing in disguise.” For the first time in a decade, Ravitch said, she feels public schools are “gaining ground on the school privatization movement... and I don’t think it’s going to survive the scrutiny.”Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, the nation’s second largest teachers union, says she has also seen increased engagement among her members in the age of Trump and DeVos ― especially as an upcoming Supreme Court case threatens to deal a major blow to union finances. She told HuffPost she has recently observed a string of local races where pro-public education advocates have prevailed. More members are showing up at town halls and regional meetings.“You see a tremendous appetite to fight,” Weingarten said.But she’s not cheery about the reasons for this increased engagement.  “What you also see, on the other side, is a brazen, non-hidden quest to just kill us, and to kill every bit of every tool that enables broad-based voice and opportunity,” she said. Indeed, Carol Burris, executive director of the Network for Public Education, says she is far more more worried than she is optimistic about DeVos’ impact.“The truth of the matter is, even though there is a heightened awareness and pushback, there is so much money on the other side that it is overwhelming,” said Burris, a former public school principal. Despite widespread dislike for DeVos and some of her policies, these issues are still moving forward in many places. A majority of consequential education policy decisions are made at the state and local levels, especially as DeVos’ plans for more federal school choice have mostly stalled. Burris notes that groups like hers have seen an increase in monetary donations ― but “because there are so many Republican majorities in statehouses, they are seizing the day,” she said. “They are sponsoring legislation at a breakneck speed.”Advocates for charter schools say they have seen some declining support from liberals, but support among centrists and conservatives has remained steady. Peri Lynn Turnbull handles external relations and strategy at the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools. She says that while charter schools have become a harder sell in left-leaning, anti-Trump states, she’s glad that overall it has become a more relevant issue. It has become challenging, though, to combat what she calls increased misinformation about what charter schools are and what they do. “It’s elevated the conversation, for one. There’s no doubt about it,” said Turnbull, whose organization has also been critical of many of Trump and DeVos’ signature priorities. On the other hand, Lennie Jarratt of the Heartland Institute, a conservative and libertarian think tank, said there’s been an increase in private school choice legislation at the state level that “hadn’t happened like that in prior years.” Private school choice takes various forms ― whether through tax credits, vouchers, or education savings accounts ― but it generally helps parents subsidize a child’s enrollment in a private school. Opponents of private school choice say it drains public school systems of resources.  “Teachers unions pushed back harder probably than any other year against school choice,” Jarratt said. “The proponents of school choice [have] been just as vocal, and more vocal too.”Jeanne Allen, head of the pro-charter and pro-voucher group Center for Education Reform, says that not having to advocate as much to get a voice with federal leaders has freed up her group to focus more on other issues. She doesn’t believe that opposition to DeVos has had any lasting impact on the education field.“She’s not everyone’s cup of tea, but when I talk to people from all walks of life, I get very little, I hear very little criticism,” Allen said. “I think the political fallout over her confirmation was a very, very small vocal minority of people who have any kind of lasting concerns.”"

He spoke enthusiastically about competing in Europe, taking his first airplane and train rides, and visiting the Olympic museum in Lausanne, Switzerland.“And then, when you see, like, all these things about other people who have won the Olympics and everything, you think that you’ve done a great thing,” Rippon, a Scranton, Pennsylvania, native, told reporter Jim Coles. “But you’re still so far away.”The young Rippon, who has since become the first openly gay U.S. figure skater to compete at the games, also had some tips on how to succeed in the sport:“All the little things that your coach tells you, you always have to remember them. And you always have to try not to overdo it, just to do it. So as long as you remember everything your coach tells you, you’ll be OK.”Rippon has risen to prominence during his time in South Korea for hitting out at Vice President Mike Pence’s alleged intolerance toward the LGBTQ community, the condoms in the Olympic village, and for joking about wanting “Xanax and a quick drink” on the ice. He has a further shot at gold in the men’s single skating event Friday.Check out the full interview above."

The pop superstar will be honored with the Vanguard Award at the 29th annual GLAAD Media Awards on April 12 in Los Angeles. Each year, the award is bestowed on a media personality who has “made a significant difference in promoting equality and acceptance of LGBTQ people,” GLAAD officials said in a press release. Spears joins a number of A-list stars, including Jennifer Lopez, Janet Jackson and Demi Lovato, who have received the honor. GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis said Spears “embodied the spirit of GLAAD’s Vanguard Award by speaking out on significant issues that face her fans ― from the Dream Act to anti-transgender bills in Texas.”“She is a force in the music world who has used her global platform to share messages of love and acceptance, something that the world needs today more than ever,” she continued in a Tuesday post on the organization’s website.Spears seemed elated by the news, tweeting: Spears has stepped up her support of the LGBTQ community in recent years. In 2016, she joined Troye Sivan, Gwen Stefani, Meghan Trainor and other artists in performing “Hands,” a song released by GLAAD in honor of the 49 victims of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida, which targeted the LGBTQ community. She was also one of more than 140 stars to speak out against two anti-LGBTQ bills introduced, but later defeated, in Texas last year. The singer, who will return to the concert stage on her Piece of Me Tour this summer, wrote a heartfelt “love letter” to her LGBTQ fanbase for Billboard in honor of Pride Month last June. “Continuously throughout my career, you’ve always been so vocal about what a positive impact I’ve had on you ― that I’ve instilled joy, hope and love in you at times when there was none,” she wrote. “Your stories are what inspire me, bring me joy and make me and my sons strive to be better people.”"

Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing. “My experience has been that every office I go to, every division I go to, has patriots: people who could do anything else with their careers, but choose to work for the FBI because they believe in serving others.” Wray noted that he’s received reassuringly positive feedback from state and local law enforcement, from the private sector and from communities served by the bureau.“I’m a big believer in the idea that the FBI speaks through its work, through its cases, though the victims it protects,” Wray said. “I encourage our folks not to get too hung up on what I consider to be the noise on TV and in social media.”The director said that he’d seen no evidence of inherent political bias in the bureau and that he thinks the bureau’s employees can weather the storm.“Our people are very mission-focused,” Wray said. “I like to think that our folks are pretty sturdy.” Trump nominated Wray as head of the FBI after he fired then-Director James Comey last spring. Earlier this month, the bureau publicly stated that a Republican-authored memo that Trump and his supporters were using to undermine special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election had “material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo’s accuracy.”Republican confidence in the FBI has dropped significantly as Trump has been able to convince many of his supporters that the bureau is biased against him, despite the fact that the bureau’s public handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation ahead of the 2016 election actually boosted Trump’s candidacy.
