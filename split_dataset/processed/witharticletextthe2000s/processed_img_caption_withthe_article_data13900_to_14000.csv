(It) ... does not mean that the companies are guilty of anti-competitive behavior nor does it prejudge the outcome of the investigation itself.”The Commission did not name any of the companies affected, but Murdoch’s FNG confirmed its involvement after it was first reported by the Telegraph newspaper.The news of the raid comes at a difficult time for Fox which is engaged in string of deals that are facing regulatory approval.It is battling Comcast and British regulators for the right to buy Europe’s biggest pay-TV company Sky for around $15 billion while it has also agreed to sell a string of assets to Walt Disney Co for around $52 billion.The Commission said there was no legal deadline to complete inquiries into anti-competitive conduct and EC investigations can be lengthy.(Reporting by Kate Holton, editing by Larry King, G Crosse and Jonathan Oatis)"
1,POLITICS,We Asked Senators If They Want To Use Lights And Sirens To Beat Traffic Like Scott Pruitt,Igor Bobic,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/scott-pruitt-lights-sirens-traffic_us_5acc0896e4b0337ad1eb03df,"Doing so should be ""based on the security circumstances, not your dinner schedule,"" said Sen. Brian Schatz.",2018-04-10,"Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) says, ""You don’t need a siren in your car. You do not.”",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5acc1be72000001311eb4427.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Lawmakers laughed off the idea of using a vehicle’s lights and sirens to speed up some of their trips around the nation’s capital ― a request Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt reportedly made to his security detail last year.“I don’t have any lights and sirens, so that is not an option,” chuckled Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) on Monday after being asked whether he would do so to beat traffic in D.C. Pruitt wanted to “use flashing lights and sirens in his motorcade ... to expedite local trips in Washington to the airport or to dinner, including at least one trip to Le Diplomate, a trendy French restaurant that he frequented,” according to The New York Times.When the lead agent in charge of Pruitt’s security detail questioned the use of lights and sirens for such a purpose ― which was against agency policy ― and told the administrator that sirens were to be used only in emergencies, he was later reassigned to a new job within the EPA, according to CBS News. EPA chief of staff Ryan Jackson told CBS News in a statement, “We have no knowledge of anyone being removed from the detail for not using lights and sirens.” Asked why the agent in charge of security was removed, an EPA spokesman said, “We do not comment on personnel matters within EPA’s protective service detail.”Admittedly, the use of sirens and lights to bypass traffic in Washington may rank near the bottom of at least 23 ethics issues Pruitt is currently facing, including a sweetheart deal he got to stay in a condo owned by the wife of an energy lobbyist for $50 a night.But it’s just another example of the strange approach Pruitt has taken to what has traditionally been a relatively low-profile job. Other incidents involving Pruitt include spending $3,000 to sweep his office for surveillance bugs and $42,000 to build a secret phone booth in his office. Lawmakers of both parties, who are frequently driven around town by aides and do not travel with a security detail, said Monday they wouldn’t use lights and sirens to cut through traffic and do not think a high-ranking government official ought to, either.“I was just talking to somebody else about how all these security precautions ― we want to protect government officials and stuff, but some of this stuff is kind of over the top,” Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) told HuffPost.Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) said he has “never, ever owned a siren in my entire life.”“Maybe when I was a kid,” he added, “I had a little fire truck with a siren on it, but my advice to all people in official positions is, No. 1, never take, accept, and use a government credit card, and No. 2, you don’t need a siren in your car. You do not.”Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) appeared confused about the idea of a Cabinet official using flashing lights and sirens to get around traffic.“I didn’t know they stopped traffic for members or senators,” he said. “I thought they stopped traffic for the president, foreign leaders and the vice president.”The nation’s governors, as executives of their states, may also travel in a motorcade with police whose lights and sirens can stop traffic.Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), a former governor of West Virginia, didn’t fully answer a question about whether he would use lights and sirens to beat traffic in D.C.“I never...” he trailed off before an aide interjected by saying, “We don’t have sirens.”Asked whether he would ever use the technique to beat traffic in the capital, Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), a former lieutenant governor of his state, put his head back and laughed.“The only time they used blue lights was in case of emergency or real safety concerns. You never used it for convenience. It was not at your discretion as the protectee; it was the head of the detail that made a determination.”He added: “It was based on the security circumstances, not your dinner schedule.”"
2,POLITICS,"FBI Raid, Staff Exits, Canceled Foreign Trip Making For Best 'Infrastructure Week' Yet",S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-no-chaos_us_5acd2500e4b09212968c945b,"In a chaotic administration, this week could be one for the books – and it’s not even half done",2018-04-10,White House homeland security adviser Tom Bossert is the latest official to abruptly depart from the Trump administration.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5acd39b32000002d00eb45cd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― If Donald Trump is to be believed when he claims his White House has “no Chaos, only great Energy,” this week may well be the most energetic of his presidency.Trump has seen the departure of top National Security Council staff amid discussions of a possible military strike on Syria. His Environmental Protection Agency chief continues weathering a daily drip of ethics violation allegations. His personal lawyer was raided by the FBI. He canceled a long-planned foreign trip. And he opened a meeting with military leaders with a 700-word tirade against the prosecutor investigating him and his associates ― and then acknowledged he is considering firing him.And it is only Tuesday.“It’s unadulterated madness. But because it happens so often, it tends to become the norm,” said John Weaver, who joked that the last few days could set a low-water mark for an “infrastructure week” ― Washington shorthand for times when the White House has attempted to set a coherent message, only to see it descend into bedlam.Weaver, who ran Ohio Gov. John Kasich’s presidential campaign in the 2016 GOP primaries, was among a number of prominent Republicans who warned that a Trump presidency would be unending chaos because of Trump’s basic character. He said special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe was completely predictable, given Trump’s behavior. “So please stop with the ‘witch hunt,’” Weaver said.Trump started using that phrase to describe the investigation more than a year ago, and last month escalated it to the all-capital “WITCH HUNT.” On Tuesday morning Trump took it up another notch still: “A TOTAL WITCH HUNT!!!”But the president’s protestations notwithstanding, Mueller’s probe of possible collusion by Trump’s campaign with the Russian spy agencies that helped him win the election has already produced guilty pleas from five people and criminal charges against 14 others. Among those who have pleaded guilty are Trump’s original national security adviser and his deputy campaign chairman. Among those facing charges are Trump’s former campaign chairman and 13 Russians who worked to hurt Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and to help Trump.On Monday, the probe expanded to include Trump’s longtime personal lawyer and “fixer,” Michael Cohen, whose offices were searched.In the days leading up to the 2016 election, Cohen had worked to buy the silence of two women who say they had had affairs with Trump. Documents show that prosecutors are interested in that effort as well as, unrelatedly, Cohen’s handling of New York City taxi medallions.“He’s got a guy who’s trying to juggle taxi medallions and porn stars and the president of the United States,” Weaver laughed. “What could go wrong?” The staff departures from the NSC have come quickly after the arrival of Trump’s latest national security adviser, John Bolton. NSC spokesman Michael Anton resigned Sunday, and Monday saw the unexpected exit of Tom Bossert, who had been Trump’s homeland security adviser.Bossert had told conference attendees in Sea Island, Georgia, just Sunday that the White House had actually become a relatively normal place. “I think at this point we’ve reached what seems to be a decent stability point,” he said.Bossert’s departure came not long after the White House announcement that Trump would not be flying to Lima, Peru, on Friday to attend the Summit of the Americas this weekend. That decision came shortly after Trump resumed his complaints on Twitter about Mueller’s investigation, continuing his attacks from the previous evening.The White House, though, said Trump’s decision to skip the South America trip was not as hasty as it seemed. The idea was first broached immediately after the suspected chemical weapons attack in Syria on Saturday, one White House official said on condition of anonymity.If there was to be a U.S. military response, the thinking went, it was better for the president to be in the White House with ready access to his full NSC staff than on a foreign trip. “It’s something that’s been considered for some days,” the official said.“The president and his national security team felt it was best that he stay in the United States while all of these developments were taking place,” press secretary Sarah Sanders said at Tuesday’s briefing.Whether the Syrian situation was the actual reason for the cancellation or a convenient excuse, Trump’s dislike of traveling generally and foreign travel in particular is well known.During much of his campaign for president, Trump would almost without fail begin and end each day in New York to avoid having to spend a night somewhere other than his apartment in Trump Tower.White House officials privately acknowledge that Trump does not really enjoy foreign trips at all, especially those in which he will be forced to interact with leaders who do not particularly like him. This was bound to be the case in South America, where Trump is widely disliked because of his comments on immigration and Mexicans. The White House had already trimmed what had originally been planned as a five-day trip down to three days.Whatever the reason for the cancelation, not having Trump attend ― and having Vice President Mike Pence go in his place ― might actually be better for relations between the United States and the nations of South America, said one scholar.“I’m relieved. I was afraid he’d ask Latin America to help with his windmill battle against China,” said Monica de Bolle, a Brazil expert with the Peterson Institute for International Economics, referring to Trump’s recent offensive against Chinese trade policies. “It would have gone over very badly, indeed! I think the region has a whole lot more to lose from angering China than from angering Trump, who angers easily anyway.”"

Trump Foundation for a 20-minute video appearance by Trump to a conference in Kiev.The White House didn’t immediately return HuffPost’s request for comment.The review of Pinchuk’s payment is part of Mueller’s larger probe into streams of foreign money Trump may have had access to in the years leading up to the 2016 presidential election, the Times reported.Trump’s attorney Michael Cohen reportedly personally solicited the donation to the foundation.Cohen’s New York offices and hotel room were raided by the FBI on Monday in an apparently unrelated probe.Ukrainian funds were also at the center of the indictment of Trump’s former campaign chair, Paul Manafort, when a federal grand jury brought forth charges against him for allegedly laundering millions of dollars in funds he accrued while working for former pro-Russian Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych."

CNN called the anchors “zombies.” Others called them much worse. Inside the conservative-leaning Sinclair, multiple anchors, including one who spoke with HuffPost, said they had initially protested the script, but ultimately relented due to restrictive contractual obligations. The response to the viral videos was “brutal,” said the anchor who spoke to HuffPost. “For having to field nasty calls, threats, personal confrontations and trolling on social media, I am truly sorry you had to endure such an experience,” Ripley wrote.“However,” he added, “as an organization it is important that we do not let extremists on any side of the political fence bully us because they do not like what they hear or see.”Throughout the email, Ripley implied that the criticism the company had faced was unfair. “As you know, the practice of on-air personalities following a script is not unique to Sinclair,” he wrote, “however, the blowback we received for doing so certainly is.”In recent weeks, one of the most frequent criticisms leveled at Sinclair has been its continued use of mandatory “must-run” segments sent to local stations, including some by Boris Epshteyn, a former Trump White House official whom Sinclair hired as a chief political analyst in April 2017.But Ripley, who served as the company’s chief financial officer before moving over to CEO in January 2017, implied nothing is set to change in that regard. He said the company will continue its “hybrid approach of bringing together the best of the local broadcast model with the best of the network model which will undoubtable [sic] expose us to more criticism because ‘no other local TV broadcasters does [sic] it that way.’”Far from giving in to criticism, Sinclair now appears to be going on the attack. On Tuesday, a public relations firm hired by Sinclair sent out a video titled “Did CNN Attack Sinclair For Doing Exactly What CNN Has Done For Years?”Sinclair did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Here is Ripley’s email in its entirety.

5,POLITICS,Trump 'Certainly Believes He Has The Power' To Fire Robert Mueller: White House,Hayley Miller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-mueller-white-house_us_5acd07bce4b09212968c60dd,"""We’ve been advised that the president certainly has the power to make that decision,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Tuesday.",2018-04-10,"White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders speaks at the press briefing at the White House in Washington, DC, on April 10, 2018.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5acd1a611e0000fb077b11c8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump “certainly believes he has the power” to fire special counsel Robert Mueller, a spokeswoman for the White House said Tuesday.“We’ve been advised that the president certainly has the power to make that decision,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters during a press briefing.Mueller is head of a federal probe into Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election. Many legal experts have said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is the only person who can directly fire Mueller. But Sanders said the White House had been advised otherwise.“I know a number of individuals in the legal community, and including at the Department of Justice, said he has the power to do so,” Sanders told reporters.Sanders did not specify which individuals she was referring to. Her office did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story.Trump on Monday suggested he was considering firing Mueller, hours after the FBI raided the office of Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen.“I think it’s a disgrace what’s going on,” Trump told reporters Monday. “We’ll see what happens, but I think it’s really a sad situation... Many people have said ‘You should fire him.’”When asked Tuesday why Trump had described the FBI raid as “an attack on our country,” Sanders simply responded that “the president is clear that he feels it’s gone too far.”Both Democratic and Republican lawmakers have defended Mueller’s role in the Russia investigation and have warned Trump not to terminate him.Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Tuesday that it would be “suicide” for Trump to fire Mueller.“I think the less the president says about this whole thing, the better off he will be,” Grassley said during an interview with CNN. “I think that Mueller is a person of stature and respected, and I respect him. Just let the thing go forward.”However, while at least four bills have been introduced to Congress that would prevent Trump from firing Mueller, several prominent Republican lawmakers have declined to move such legislation forward.“It’s still my view that Mueller should be allowed to finish his job,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told reporters Tuesday. “I haven’t seen clear indication yet that we needed to pass something to keep him from being removed.”This story has been updated."

The ploy raises fresh questions of conflict of interest, as Trump defiantly hangs onto his sprawling business interests while in office.Trump lawyers sought the Panamanian president’s help after the majority owner of the Trump International Hotel and Tower — investor Orestes Fintiklis — ejected the Trump Organization as the hotel’s manager under a court order. Fintiklis, backed by police, escorted Trump personnel off the property, stripped the Trump name from the building facade and celebrated by playing a Greek anti-fascism song on a lobby piano.Trump’s company wants President Juan Carlos Varela to help it retake control. Lawyers from the Panamanian firm Britton and Iglesias wrote to “urgently request your influence in relation to a commercial dispute regarding the Trump hotel,” according to the letter obtained by the Post and the AP, which first reported the story. “This situation is currently before the courts, but it has repercussions for the Panamanian state, which is your responsibility,” the letter warned.The letter brushed aside concerns about the separation of power between the executive branch and the judiciary, which exists in Panama just as it does in the U.S. It also suggested the hotel dispute may violate a treaty between the two nations.The Trump Organization’s direct appeal to Varela, and its treaty reference, “implicitly traded on President Trump’s name and power,” University of Minnesota political governance expert Lawrence Jacobs told AP.Varela hasn’t decided what action to take, a spokesman told the Post. Five days after the letter was sent, a court arbitrator ruled against reinstating the Trump Organization management team, suggesting the direct appeal had failed.The Trump Organization said in a statement that the letter was “routine” and “common.”“We categorically reject any assumption or assertion that the letter sought to ‘pressure’ the president of the Republic of Panama,” the company said.The White House referred questions about the letter to the Trump Organization.Unlike previous presidents, Trump has refused to divest from his business interests. His company has extensive holdings in foreign countries.“This could be the clearest example we’ve seen of a conflict of interest stemming from the president’s role as head of state in connection with other countries and his business interests,” Danielle Brian, executive director of The Project on Government Oversight, told the Post."

In a photograph published by The Hollywood Pipeline, McAdams was spotted with what appears to be her newborn son and Linden, headed out to lunch with the “Dear John” screenwriter holding the baby. The new parents were overheard talking about what a “good sleeper he is” and saying “he’s a good baby,” according to the outlet. A representative for McAdams hasn’t responded to HuffPost’s request for comment. No additional information about her pregnancy has been revealed.News of the “Mean Girls” actress’ pregnancy, which she kept completely under wraps, was first reported less than two months ago, when E! News confirmed she was expecting. McAdams and Linden have been linked since April 2016, when they were spotted together on a stroll in Los Angeles holding hands. The two have kept a low profile ever since, save for a single Instagram picture at a friend’s wedding. McAdams hasn’t been seen at a public event since the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival, noticeably skipping the press tour and premiere for her latest comedy film “Game Night” in Hollywood in February. Linden is best known for penning the scripts for “We Are Marshall,” “10 Years,” and “Money Monster.” He also co-wrote the upcoming sci-fi thriller “Chaos Walking,” starring Daisy Ridley and Tom Holland. McAdams, meanwhile, has stayed mum on her personal life, though she has dated celebrities like her “Notebook” co-star Ryan Gosling, Josh Lucas and most recently actor Michael Sheen. “I’m sorry but I don’t talk about my personal life,” she told People when asked about her dating history in 2009. She has been willing, however, to discuss her desire for starting a family on multiple occasions, explaining that her own mother is a big inspiration. “Having a few [kids] would be great,” McAdams said.“My mom is a great inspiration to me ... She’s a nurse and very nurturing and gentle. She lets me be who I am. Hopefully I can take on those qualities and be as great as her.”"

More than 10,000 companies reported data by the April 4 deadline. The numbers were bleak, though hardly surprising. As they do all over the world, women in the U.K. make less than men. Women’s median pay is close to 10 percent less than men’s, the data showed. At 80 percent of businesses that reported data in the U.K., men outearn women.But the numbers revealed something else. By breaking things down by wage level, the data reveal what percentage of the best- and worst-paying roles are held by women. In doing so, they show a major reason for the pay disparity: Women are making less not because men earn more for the same work, but because women aren’t getting the best-paying jobs.At the granular level, the numbers were truly eye-popping. Men earn more than double what women make at some companies, demonstrating that when it comes to equal pay, women aren’t just facing a “gap,” they’re staring down a vast, dystopic hole of inequity.The male-dominated finance industry was one of the worst offenders. At Goldman Sachs in the U.K., women earn 55.5 percent less than men, according to data the company submitted. Other global finance firms in the U.K. reported similar numbers. Women at Barclays make 48 percent less on average than men. At HSBC, the gap is 59 percent. JPMorgan reported paying women 36 percent less on average.At Goldman, 83 percent of the top-paying jobs are held by men, the company’s data showed. At Barclays, men represent 81 percent of the bank’s top earners. Even at the U.K. outpost of Condé Nast, publisher of Vogue, Vanity Fair and Glamour, where women are a majority at every pay level, men still outearn women by 36.9 percent on average because of a few highly paid men sitting at the tippy top.The revelations from the U.K. shine a light on the key issue when it comes to the gender pay gap. Women don’t stand a chance at pay equality if they’re not making it to the top.And the findings are worth paying attention to in the U.S., especially this Tuesday, a symbolic day of the year for women. It’s Equal Pay Day, the day women finally “catch up” in earnings to what men made in 2017. It’s also when everyone who cares about gender equality will be offering up their take on why the pay gap exists ― women earn 80 percent of what men make on average in the U.S. ― and how to fix it.The companies that reported data in the U.K. offered mostly toothless solutions.In a letter to its employees, Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein and its president and CEO heir apparent David Solomon acknowledged that there aren’t enough women in senior roles. They’re totally working on it, they said. The company is committed to having women make up 30 percent of the jobs at the vice president level and above by 2023 (that’s not equality, btw). Blankfein and Solomon also are looking to have women make up half of its entry-level workforce in three years.Those goals are somewhat laudable ― though awfully late in the making, since gender equality in banking is something that’s been talked about for decades. Mostly they seem like PR. Big companies have been launching “women’s initiatives” for a long time and still there’s been little movement at the top. For the truth about who holds the power at Goldman, just look at who was in the running to succeed Blankfein as CEO: Solomon and another man. Hardly a diverse slate of candidates. It’s likely there were few suitable female candidates internally, as there are only two female executive officers out of 11 at the company. There are far too many women and men who think the reason women aren’t making it up the ladder lies with the women themselves: They “leave before they leave,” Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg once said, dialing down ambition because they want to have a family. Or they don’t “lean in,” as she famously put it, placing the blame more on women for not being aggressive enough.And studies have shown clearly that women who become mothers face huge disadvantages at work because they do have to devote time to child-rearing. However, that’s only part of the reason women aren’t making it up the corporate ladder. Many leave because they’re sexually harassed. Others quit because they’re not getting promoted by the boys’ club at the top. And those promotions aren’t coming, in part, because of stereotypes. The men in charge hold certain beliefs about what women want out of their careers ― and often they don’t bother checking to make sure their beliefs line up with reality.When she was an investment banker at JPMorgan, Sacha Nitsetska, talked to more than 100 women there, asking them what the bank could do to keep women from leaving. “The answers were very similar: increased pay transparency, clarity on career progression and bonuses, and mentorship from the seniors,” Nitsetska writes in a post for the U.K. site efinancialcareers. But when she told senior management about her findings, she said, they did not believe her. “I was told that none of this was true and that in fact, the women are leaving because ‘they want to raise children,’” she writes.At JPMorgan in the U.K., 78 percent of the top-paying jobs are held by men. Presumably many of those men have children, but somehow they’re making it work. "

13,POLITICS,This Group Is Turning Guns Into Shovels And Using Them To Plant Trees,Nick Wing,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lead-to-life-guns-shovels-trees_us_5accb7c5e4b07a3485e86912,It’s a modern-day swords-to-plowshares movement focused on healing the victims of gun violence.,2018-04-10,Brontë Velez (left) and Kyle Lemle are the co-founders of Lead to Life.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5accc4ca1e00008e0b7b1103.jpeg?ops=crop_46_69_2967_2673%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Last week, on April 4, exactly 50 years after her father’s assassination, Rev. Bernice King, the youngest child of civil rights leaders Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King, picked up a gun for the first time in her life.The white-handled revolver wasn’t as big as the rifle used to kill her father in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1968. But in the half-century since his death, handguns were responsible for the vast share of the more than 1.5 million gun deaths in the U.S.“It’s such a small thing that can be so destructive,” King said. “There’s something wrong when something this small has so much power over us.”King, along with several families of victims of gun violence and police shootings, was attending an event at the King Center for Nonviolent Social Change in Atlanta, where activists and artists with the group Lead to Life showed how guns can be repurposed for good by melting them down into shovels.The King Center gathering was the first large public demonstration for Lead to Life, a group launched by California-based activists Kyle Lemle, 28, and Brontë Velez, 24.“It’s the ultimate transformational act, from something that takes life from the planet to something that gives life on the planet,” said Lemle. “We’re liberating the guns’ histories of violence and giving the metal a new purpose.”The revolver King carried was meant for such a symbolic change. After walking past the crypt where her parents were laid to rest, she and the other family members came to an open area in which a furnace roared with bright orange fire. A man wearing fire-resistant coveralls and a welder’s mask approached King. She gave him the gun, which he affixed to a rod and placed in the heart of the flame.Within moments, the weapon had melted away completely, disappearing into a ladle of molten iron. A team of metalworkers then poured the liquid metal into casts of a shovel handle and a peace sign.The King Center ceremony was part of a week of events for Lemle and Velez dedicated to “healing justice” for communities and individuals affected by gun violence in the Atlanta area. Their inaugural campaign kicked off amid a much larger debate about firearms in the U.S. following the February mass shooting in Parkland, Florida.In the nearly two months since the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, the tragedy has touched nearly every facet of the national discussion around guns. Much of the conversation has revolved around reforming gun laws and reversing the disturbing trend of mass shootings. There have been rallies and protests. And many of the movement’s most visible leaders are white, though the Stoneman Douglas students have championed inclusivity and diversity.Lead to Life’s tactics and focus look a bit different.“There are a constellation of ways people had been impacted by gun violence, all critical,” said Velez. She added that she is particularly interested in “centering families of color, and specifically black folks rooted in Atlanta,” in the discussion ― people whose experiences she feels sometimes get overshadowed.Velez said she was pleased to have Kai Koerber and Tyah-Amoy Roberts, two Stoneman Douglas students who are black, speak at the King Center ceremony last week.Lemle and Velez formed Lead to Life after meeting at a “Spiritual Ecology” fellowship program in 2016, when they decided to combine their interests in faith, community organizing, urban forestry, environmental racism, and racial and restorative justice.The concept of turning guns into shovels refers back to Old Testament scripture that spoke of people who “beat their swords into plowshares,” thereby turning weapons into instruments that benefited human life. Other groups and artists have replicated the symbolic act, including the Mexican artist Pedro Reyes, whom Velez has worked with in the past.But Lead to Life’s real work begins after their tools harden. Lemle and Velez want people affected by gun violence to be able to use those shovels to turn their pain and loss into new life.Over the weekend, Lead to Life hosted a series of tree plantings at sites of violence around Atlanta. They also organized a garden action day, in which volunteers used the shovels and other tools to improve a Westside Atlanta resident’s community “food forest.” Many attendees had never done this sort of farm work before, and Lemle and Velez said it provided a way for people to build positive relationships with nature.One planting, in particular, was deeply personal for Velez. In 2013, she lost a friend, 21-year-old X’avier Arnold, to a fatal shooting during a robbery attempt on a local bike path. The 14-year-old perpetrator and his adult accomplice were each sentenced to serve three life sentences in prison. Yet Velez said the idea of such a young person spending the rest of his life behind bars offered little sense of closure.On Sunday, Velez gathered at the spot of Arnold’s shooting with his family and loved ones and planted a redbud tree. They scattered Arnold’s ashes, along with soil that Velez had gathered from the site of an early 20th-century lynching along the Chattahoochee River.“There was a lot of joy, and we had time to be intimate with one another and to reflect on what it meant to plant there, at the site where he was killed,” said Velez.It takes time and space to grieve and work through trauma, said Velez, but those are luxuries not afforded to many people touched by gun violence.“With folks who have lost their children, to feel this process as one that is actually seeding something is really profound,” she said.Velez attended another tree planting on Sunday for Jamarion Robinson, a 26-year-old black man shot 76 times by U.S. marshals in 2016. Lead to Life also returned to the King Center to plant a cherry tree in Coretta Scott King’s Peace Garden.The guns involved in Lead to Life’s recent events had been donated to the San Francisco Police Department through a buyback program organized by United Playaz, a violence prevention and youth development organization. Minnesota-based metal artist James Brenner helped transport the weapons to Atlanta, along with his furnace to assist in melting and recasting them.Although Lead to Life had wanted to work with the Atlanta Police Department, Georgia state law forbids law enforcement from destroying guns that are seized from criminals or voluntarily turned in through buybacks. A number of other states have passed similar laws in recent years, and as a result, many law enforcement agencies are forced to sell those firearms back onto the street.“We couldn’t actually get weapons from [the Atlanta Police Department] because of politics,” said Lemle.In the future, Lead to Life plans to work directly with people who want to turn over their guns. The organization has seen increased interest in the wake of the Parkland shooting, said Lemle.“We’ve already had folks reaching out to us inspired by the work, wanting to get rid of their guns for good,” he said. Lemle added that gun owners must first disable their firearms by making cuts to weapons before shipping them to Lead to Life or a partner organization. But he advised people to reach out for instructions before doing anything.With an estimated 300 million firearms in civilian hands in America, Lemle and Velez understand this sort of project alone won’t make a meaningful dent in gun violence, a nationwide epidemic that erupts each year in around 11,000 homicides, 22,000 suicides and tens of thousands of other nonfatal shootings.“It’s a drop in the ocean to turn a gun into a shovel,” Velez said. “We’re more about what we as a people need to do to be well and together with one another to heal, because we can’t wait for the state to do that for us.”But if Lead to Life’s first round of events is any indication, Lemle and Velez believe they can at least shift participants’ consciousness in ways that may help disrupt the cycles of violence. By offering time and space to process trauma, as well as a place to foster healthy relationships with nature and each other, Lemle and Velez hope to turn people away from apathy and eventually toward political change.“It’s really a spiritual crisis that is causing us to kill each other and render people and planet as disposable,” Lemle said. “Nothing is going to change on Capitol Hill until there is a true social movement demanding peace, and where I think social movements truly begin is from that spiritual place within ourselves.”"
14,BLACK VOICES,2 Ministers Are Trying To Revive The Campaign To End Poverty That MLK Started,Julia Craven,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/poor-peoples-campaign-mlk-william-barber_us_5acbceabe4b07a3485e77bec,“The time is now — more than ever — for us to have a Poor People's Campaign.”,2018-04-10,Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and other prominent civil rights and religious leaders walk during the March on Washington for Jobs & Freedom in 1963.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5acbcfa5200000d30ceb43fe.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"He couldn’t stop thinking about them, their wide eyes and the silent hunger that lay behind them.Staring up at the ceiling from his motel bed, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. told his closest confidant, Rev. Ralph Abernathy, that the impoverished children they visited earlier that day were cemented in his mind.It was June 1966 and the pair had stopped by an early Head Start facility in Marks, Mississippi, which is the seat of Quitman County, a devastatingly poor area in the alluvial plains of the Mississippi Delta that was thought to be the most impoverished in the country at the time.Quitman had everything King fought against: A lack of job and home security, particularly for the black sharecropping families who often lived in shacks on the plantations where they worked unpredictable harvests. Abysmal schools, where black students were taught in poorly ventilated classrooms with out-of-date textbooks and school lunches they couldn’t afford.But it was what King saw in that Head Start facility, a program developed to prepare young children for school, that would push him to launch the 1968 Poor People’s Campaign, an effort to demand economic security and an improvement in the quality of life for impoverished Americans. After watching a teacher cut an apple into quarters in order to feed four children, he broke down in tears — an unusual display of public emotion from King. Ultimately, he made the small town of Marks the launching pad for his campaign’s march on Washington, planned for the spring of 1968.“I can’t get those children out of my mind,” he told Abernathy. “We can’t let that kind of poverty exist in this country. I don’t think people really know that little schoolchildren are slowly starving in the United States of America. I didn’t know it.”The campaign’s dream was deferred when King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. But Coretta Scott King, an activist and the reverend’s widow, along with Abernathy and others, decided to pick up and move onward with the march, which took place on May 12 with thousands of attendees. A list of five core demands compiled by the Committee of 100 — an intersectional group of faith leaders, activists and poor people from all racial backgrounds — in the days following King’s death asserted the need for a living wage, a secure income for those who cannot find jobs, opportunity to acquire land and capital, and the right of people who will be affected to play a role in designing government programs. “We come with an appeal to open the doors of America to the almost 50 million Americans who have not been given a fair share of America’s wealth and opportunity, and we will stay until we get it,” Abernathy told the crowd during the march.Afterward, thousands of people set up a collection of tents, dubbed Resurrection City, in ongoing protest on the National Mall. The occupation lasted several weeks, ending after harsh weather and reports of racial friction led to less-than-ideal living conditions for those on site. Not long after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, a gut punch to Resurrection City residents, the group was evicted by D.C. police. The campaign dream was, again, deferred.Now, 50 years later, a new push to eradicate poverty has developed. The Poor People’s Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival, led by Rev. William Barber II and Rev. Liz Theoharis, is working to reignite Martin Luther King’s vision. A preliminary report released by the group in December found that poverty has increased by 60 percent since 1968 ― a dire statistic that speaks to the heart of the campaign’s revival.HuffPost sat down with the reverends to talk about how the campaign plans to honor King, convince millennials to align themselves with a religious movement and persuade America that racism and poverty hurt everyone.Tell me a little bit about yourselves and the campaign.Theoharis: I got involved in grassroots anti-poverty organizing about 25 years ago with the National Union of the Homeless and the National Welfare Rights Union. In that work, I was introduced to the 1968 Poor People’s Campaign, because current efforts of poor people organizing ourselves were inspired by that campaign. I realized that the call to organize and live amongst poor people was a religious call, and so I enrolled at Union Theological Seminary, got a master of divinity and got ordained in the Presbyterian Church USA. I was ordained to help build the Freedom Church of the Poor that Dr. King was talking about in the last years of his life, which harkened back to the Freedom Church of the Poor of the abolitionist movement. I helped found the Kairos Center about 14 years ago at Union Theological Seminary. A lot of the focus there was to build a Poor People’s Campaign for today. At the launch event for the Kairos Center in November of 2013, Reverend Barber was the keynote speaker and there we were able to connect. Over the past four or five years, we’ve been working alongside each other and thinking about this Poor People’s Campaign. I’ve been going around to congregations and to people over the last 20 years, and there hasn’t been a week where people don’t quote the Bible passage where Jesus says the poor will be with you always. I’ve heard people say that to justify inaction in the face of poverty; to say that if God wanted to end poverty, God would do so. I’ve found that one of the biggest biblical roadblocks and one of the biggest obstacles in anti-poverty organizing work — especially among poor people — was this notion that the Bible justifies poverty and that God condoned poverty. What I learned in the process of studying the Bible was that there are other moments in U.S. history when the Bible has been used to justify oppression.Barber: I was born two days after the March on Washington [in 1963] to a family where my father was an activist and trained clergy. He ended up leading our family back to eastern North Carolina where he was born after he received a call to come help with desegregation ― because the county did not really begin desegregation until about 14 to 15 years after the Brown [v. Board of Education] decision. My father was one of the first science teachers to integrate a high school. My mother was the first black person to integrate the secretarial pool at the high school. So, in some ways, I was introduced to activism at an early age. My father also chose to be a part of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), which is a predominantly white party of Christians in this country with a deep social justice theology — and he chose to work among the poor.After finishing Duke University Divinity School, I went to Martinsville, Virginia, which is a poor community in the southern part of the state, and helped people there fight against businesses that were putting toxic waste in the black communities. In 2006, I ran for president of the North Carolina NAACP and was elected.In 2007, we began the Forward Together [Moral Movement]. It was a mass coalition of over 60 organizations that began to challenge the then-Democratic-led [North Carolina] General Assembly and government on issues related to poverty, education, voting rights, fundamental human and civil rights for all regardless of race, their creed, their color or their sexuality. That coalition helped to win a raise in the minimum wage in North Carolina. We were responsible for winning same-day registration and early voting as well as the North Carolina Racial Justice Act that gave people the option to have cases reviewed if race was found to be used in assigning the death penalty. And we pushed one of our U.S. senators to vote for the Affordable Care Act.I became the architect of the Moral Monday protests in 2013. This is after a tea party-led group — because of voter suppression and racial gerrymandering — took over the North Carolina General Assembly, won the governor’s office and began to roll back the state’s progressive policies. Many Americans are still dealing with a number of the issues that King fought against ― voter suppression and poverty, especially. With this in mind, how is the campaign relevant today?Theoharis: Our campaign commissioned the Souls of Poor Folk audit ― which was put together by the Institute for Policy Studies, the Urban Institute and a team of economists, policymakers and impacted people — and a preliminary report came out on Dec. 4. And we do indeed see that there are 60 percent more people living below the poverty line today than 50 years ago. There are fewer voting rights than 50 years ago. Ecological devastation has really sped up with poisoned water, fracking and mountaintop removal. The extreme effects of climate change are impacting so many poor and marginalized communities across the globe. We have 60 cents of each discretionary dollar going to the war economy.And none of the current political discourse actually revolves around the issues that affect the majority of people. Reverend Barber and I have said many times before that in the 2016 presidential election not one of the debates took up voter suppression or the Voting Rights Act and how we need to re-establish that. None of those debates spent any time on poverty and poor people. When poverty and poor people are mentioned in our political discourse, it’s to blame poor people for everyone else’s problems. Our elected officials talk about the middle class but not how close to half of the population is low-income. The time is now — more than ever — for us to have a Poor People’s Campaign.Barber: Dr. King connected three issues: racism, poverty and militarism. He saw those issues as interrelated, bound together, that you couldn’t address one without the other. He was very clear that in order to address these interlocking injustices, you had to have an intersectional response. He said that the only hope for the nation moving forward was for all working-class and poor people to come together and form a powerful movement for moral justice — not just resistance — and that would hold these issues together and not separate them into silos. He was very cognizant of the danger that America was in. Fifty years later and America has still not fully addressed these issues. Dr. King said in his speech following the Selma to Montgomery March that whenever there was the possibility of the black and white masses — especially the poor and working-class black and white masses — to come together, that they should.This is why white aristocracy and others always sowed division and racism to prevent that from happening, because of how it could change the nation. If you didn’t have voter suppression and racialized gerrymandering, white and black and brown people could come together and hold the power to flip many states. That would fundamentally change electoral politics in this country and thereby change our policies.Why does this campaign have to appeal to everyone? Why is it not something that can just focus on black people and other people of color?Barber: Dr. King never focused on just black people. That’s the misnomer of the corporate and political reinterpretation of him. As early as 1958, he was talking about how the 1 percent was ruling over the 99 percent. The Poor People’s Campaign had great diversity.If you look down through history, change really only took place in this country when there were fusion movements. The abolitionist movement was black and white. The Reconstruction movement was black and white people. The only real hope for America is to have this kind of fusion coalition. That’s why we’re visiting different communities from California to the Carolinas. We are going to visit homeless people, who are predominately white millennials, in Grays Harbor [County, Washington]. We will be on the Apache reservation [in Arizona] where multinational companies are trying to drill on sacred lands, which will poison aquifers, but the water won’t stay on that reservation. It’ll actually flow into the adjacent counties and towns, many of which are predominately white. When you look at all the states that denied Medicaid expansion, the majority of those people who got hurt were white — mostly in the South and in the Rust Belt. And yet some politicians used code words like “Obamacare” and fooled people into a racist resistance to the Affordable Care Act.We have to unmask this stuff. We have to show the intersections between race and poverty. We have to show that voter suppression hurts all people and allows the people who get elected to use their power to pass policies that hurt all people. [Editor’s note: Rev. Barber had to leave the conversation at this point. We continued on with Rev. Theoharis.]You were talking about the ways in which the Bible justifies oppression. So how does the campaign plan to reach people who can’t move past that fact?Theoharis: We’re finding how much talking about our deepest constitutional values, our deepest moral values resonates with people. We’re seeing that it resonates with everybody. You know, when we were in Albuquerque in a church that held 500, there were 4,700 people squeezed into that church.Some young people came up to Reverend Barber and said they never would have been caught in a church because of how religion has been used — Christianity in particular — to hurt queer people. But being part of that mass meeting and connecting with folks from indigenous spiritual traditions, with Muslims, with Jewish folk, with Sikh and Hindu people, and with Christians of all stripes and talking about the real issues that impact people ― that has been really empowering and really important and necessary.We’re talking about what’s at the center of our faith traditions, but also what’s at the center for people who don’t have faith. People who also believe that the arc of the universe is long and it bends towards justice.King’s thought behind the campaign was that while black liberation was vital, black folks and other people of color wouldn’t truly be free until they had economic security. Why is economic security so important for people of color and everybody? Why will this resonate today considering the racial wealth gap and other socioeconomic disadvantages we’re dealing with?Theoharis: One of the King quotes that I find really helpful is: “What good is having the right to sit at a lunch counter if you can’t afford to buy a hamburger?”I live in New York City, and when you walk around, you see menus posted outside of restaurants. And if you can’t afford the prices, you might as well not go in. This is the kind of economic insecurity that so many people face, according to our audit: 140 million people are poor or low-income; 80 percent of people at some point in our lives will experience poverty and hardship; 50 percent of kids are in food-insecure homes. Among people of color, it is way worse and those numbers are not getting better and, in fact, they’re getting worse. We were in Lowndes County, Alabama, a couple of weeks ago for the 53rd anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery March and Bloody Sunday.

15,BLACK VOICES,2 Ministers Are Trying To Revive The Campaign To End Poverty That MLK Started,Julia Craven,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/poor-peoples-campaign-mlk-william-barber_us_5acbceabe4b07a3485e77bec,“The time is now — more than ever — for us to have a Poor People's Campaign.”,2018-04-10,Civil rights activist Rev. William Barber II speaks during the launch of the Power to the Polls voter registration tour in Las Vegas in January.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5acbd04e1e0000fb077b0f9e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"He couldn’t stop thinking about them, their wide eyes and the silent hunger that lay behind them.Staring up at the ceiling from his motel bed, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. told his closest confidant, Rev. Ralph Abernathy, that the impoverished children they visited earlier that day were cemented in his mind.It was June 1966 and the pair had stopped by an early Head Start facility in Marks, Mississippi, which is the seat of Quitman County, a devastatingly poor area in the alluvial plains of the Mississippi Delta that was thought to be the most impoverished in the country at the time.Quitman had everything King fought against: A lack of job and home security, particularly for the black sharecropping families who often lived in shacks on the plantations where they worked unpredictable harvests. Abysmal schools, where black students were taught in poorly ventilated classrooms with out-of-date textbooks and school lunches they couldn’t afford.But it was what King saw in that Head Start facility, a program developed to prepare young children for school, that would push him to launch the 1968 Poor People’s Campaign, an effort to demand economic security and an improvement in the quality of life for impoverished Americans. After watching a teacher cut an apple into quarters in order to feed four children, he broke down in tears — an unusual display of public emotion from King. Ultimately, he made the small town of Marks the launching pad for his campaign’s march on Washington, planned for the spring of 1968.“I can’t get those children out of my mind,” he told Abernathy. “We can’t let that kind of poverty exist in this country. I don’t think people really know that little schoolchildren are slowly starving in the United States of America. I didn’t know it.”The campaign’s dream was deferred when King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. But Coretta Scott King, an activist and the reverend’s widow, along with Abernathy and others, decided to pick up and move onward with the march, which took place on May 12 with thousands of attendees. A list of five core demands compiled by the Committee of 100 — an intersectional group of faith leaders, activists and poor people from all racial backgrounds — in the days following King’s death asserted the need for a living wage, a secure income for those who cannot find jobs, opportunity to acquire land and capital, and the right of people who will be affected to play a role in designing government programs. “We come with an appeal to open the doors of America to the almost 50 million Americans who have not been given a fair share of America’s wealth and opportunity, and we will stay until we get it,” Abernathy told the crowd during the march.Afterward, thousands of people set up a collection of tents, dubbed Resurrection City, in ongoing protest on the National Mall. The occupation lasted several weeks, ending after harsh weather and reports of racial friction led to less-than-ideal living conditions for those on site. Not long after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, a gut punch to Resurrection City residents, the group was evicted by D.C. police. The campaign dream was, again, deferred.Now, 50 years later, a new push to eradicate poverty has developed. The Poor People’s Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival, led by Rev. William Barber II and Rev. Liz Theoharis, is working to reignite Martin Luther King’s vision. A preliminary report released by the group in December found that poverty has increased by 60 percent since 1968 ― a dire statistic that speaks to the heart of the campaign’s revival.HuffPost sat down with the reverends to talk about how the campaign plans to honor King, convince millennials to align themselves with a religious movement and persuade America that racism and poverty hurt everyone.Tell me a little bit about yourselves and the campaign.Theoharis: I got involved in grassroots anti-poverty organizing about 25 years ago with the National Union of the Homeless and the National Welfare Rights Union. In that work, I was introduced to the 1968 Poor People’s Campaign, because current efforts of poor people organizing ourselves were inspired by that campaign. I realized that the call to organize and live amongst poor people was a religious call, and so I enrolled at Union Theological Seminary, got a master of divinity and got ordained in the Presbyterian Church USA. I was ordained to help build the Freedom Church of the Poor that Dr. King was talking about in the last years of his life, which harkened back to the Freedom Church of the Poor of the abolitionist movement. I helped found the Kairos Center about 14 years ago at Union Theological Seminary. A lot of the focus there was to build a Poor People’s Campaign for today. At the launch event for the Kairos Center in November of 2013, Reverend Barber was the keynote speaker and there we were able to connect. Over the past four or five years, we’ve been working alongside each other and thinking about this Poor People’s Campaign. I’ve been going around to congregations and to people over the last 20 years, and there hasn’t been a week where people don’t quote the Bible passage where Jesus says the poor will be with you always. I’ve heard people say that to justify inaction in the face of poverty; to say that if God wanted to end poverty, God would do so. I’ve found that one of the biggest biblical roadblocks and one of the biggest obstacles in anti-poverty organizing work — especially among poor people — was this notion that the Bible justifies poverty and that God condoned poverty. What I learned in the process of studying the Bible was that there are other moments in U.S. history when the Bible has been used to justify oppression.Barber: I was born two days after the March on Washington [in 1963] to a family where my father was an activist and trained clergy. He ended up leading our family back to eastern North Carolina where he was born after he received a call to come help with desegregation ― because the county did not really begin desegregation until about 14 to 15 years after the Brown [v. Board of Education] decision. My father was one of the first science teachers to integrate a high school. My mother was the first black person to integrate the secretarial pool at the high school. So, in some ways, I was introduced to activism at an early age. My father also chose to be a part of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), which is a predominantly white party of Christians in this country with a deep social justice theology — and he chose to work among the poor.After finishing Duke University Divinity School, I went to Martinsville, Virginia, which is a poor community in the southern part of the state, and helped people there fight against businesses that were putting toxic waste in the black communities. In 2006, I ran for president of the North Carolina NAACP and was elected.In 2007, we began the Forward Together [Moral Movement]. It was a mass coalition of over 60 organizations that began to challenge the then-Democratic-led [North Carolina] General Assembly and government on issues related to poverty, education, voting rights, fundamental human and civil rights for all regardless of race, their creed, their color or their sexuality. That coalition helped to win a raise in the minimum wage in North Carolina. We were responsible for winning same-day registration and early voting as well as the North Carolina Racial Justice Act that gave people the option to have cases reviewed if race was found to be used in assigning the death penalty. And we pushed one of our U.S. senators to vote for the Affordable Care Act.I became the architect of the Moral Monday protests in 2013. This is after a tea party-led group — because of voter suppression and racial gerrymandering — took over the North Carolina General Assembly, won the governor’s office and began to roll back the state’s progressive policies. Many Americans are still dealing with a number of the issues that King fought against ― voter suppression and poverty, especially. With this in mind, how is the campaign relevant today?Theoharis: Our campaign commissioned the Souls of Poor Folk audit ― which was put together by the Institute for Policy Studies, the Urban Institute and a team of economists, policymakers and impacted people — and a preliminary report came out on Dec. 4. And we do indeed see that there are 60 percent more people living below the poverty line today than 50 years ago. There are fewer voting rights than 50 years ago. Ecological devastation has really sped up with poisoned water, fracking and mountaintop removal. The extreme effects of climate change are impacting so many poor and marginalized communities across the globe. We have 60 cents of each discretionary dollar going to the war economy.And none of the current political discourse actually revolves around the issues that affect the majority of people. Reverend Barber and I have said many times before that in the 2016 presidential election not one of the debates took up voter suppression or the Voting Rights Act and how we need to re-establish that. None of those debates spent any time on poverty and poor people. When poverty and poor people are mentioned in our political discourse, it’s to blame poor people for everyone else’s problems. Our elected officials talk about the middle class but not how close to half of the population is low-income. The time is now — more than ever — for us to have a Poor People’s Campaign.Barber: Dr. King connected three issues: racism, poverty and militarism. He saw those issues as interrelated, bound together, that you couldn’t address one without the other. He was very clear that in order to address these interlocking injustices, you had to have an intersectional response. He said that the only hope for the nation moving forward was for all working-class and poor people to come together and form a powerful movement for moral justice — not just resistance — and that would hold these issues together and not separate them into silos. He was very cognizant of the danger that America was in. Fifty years later and America has still not fully addressed these issues. Dr. King said in his speech following the Selma to Montgomery March that whenever there was the possibility of the black and white masses — especially the poor and working-class black and white masses — to come together, that they should.This is why white aristocracy and others always sowed division and racism to prevent that from happening, because of how it could change the nation. If you didn’t have voter suppression and racialized gerrymandering, white and black and brown people could come together and hold the power to flip many states. That would fundamentally change electoral politics in this country and thereby change our policies.Why does this campaign have to appeal to everyone? Why is it not something that can just focus on black people and other people of color?Barber: Dr. King never focused on just black people. That’s the misnomer of the corporate and political reinterpretation of him. As early as 1958, he was talking about how the 1 percent was ruling over the 99 percent. The Poor People’s Campaign had great diversity.If you look down through history, change really only took place in this country when there were fusion movements. The abolitionist movement was black and white. The Reconstruction movement was black and white people. The only real hope for America is to have this kind of fusion coalition. That’s why we’re visiting different communities from California to the Carolinas. We are going to visit homeless people, who are predominately white millennials, in Grays Harbor [County, Washington]. We will be on the Apache reservation [in Arizona] where multinational companies are trying to drill on sacred lands, which will poison aquifers, but the water won’t stay on that reservation. It’ll actually flow into the adjacent counties and towns, many of which are predominately white. When you look at all the states that denied Medicaid expansion, the majority of those people who got hurt were white — mostly in the South and in the Rust Belt. And yet some politicians used code words like “Obamacare” and fooled people into a racist resistance to the Affordable Care Act.We have to unmask this stuff. We have to show the intersections between race and poverty. We have to show that voter suppression hurts all people and allows the people who get elected to use their power to pass policies that hurt all people. [Editor’s note: Rev. Barber had to leave the conversation at this point. We continued on with Rev. Theoharis.]You were talking about the ways in which the Bible justifies oppression. So how does the campaign plan to reach people who can’t move past that fact?Theoharis: We’re finding how much talking about our deepest constitutional values, our deepest moral values resonates with people. We’re seeing that it resonates with everybody. You know, when we were in Albuquerque in a church that held 500, there were 4,700 people squeezed into that church.Some young people came up to Reverend Barber and said they never would have been caught in a church because of how religion has been used — Christianity in particular — to hurt queer people. But being part of that mass meeting and connecting with folks from indigenous spiritual traditions, with Muslims, with Jewish folk, with Sikh and Hindu people, and with Christians of all stripes and talking about the real issues that impact people ― that has been really empowering and really important and necessary.We’re talking about what’s at the center of our faith traditions, but also what’s at the center for people who don’t have faith. People who also believe that the arc of the universe is long and it bends towards justice.King’s thought behind the campaign was that while black liberation was vital, black folks and other people of color wouldn’t truly be free until they had economic security. Why is economic security so important for people of color and everybody? Why will this resonate today considering the racial wealth gap and other socioeconomic disadvantages we’re dealing with?Theoharis: One of the King quotes that I find really helpful is: “What good is having the right to sit at a lunch counter if you can’t afford to buy a hamburger?”I live in New York City, and when you walk around, you see menus posted outside of restaurants. And if you can’t afford the prices, you might as well not go in. This is the kind of economic insecurity that so many people face, according to our audit: 140 million people are poor or low-income; 80 percent of people at some point in our lives will experience poverty and hardship; 50 percent of kids are in food-insecure homes. Among people of color, it is way worse and those numbers are not getting better and, in fact, they’re getting worse. We were in Lowndes County, Alabama, a couple of weeks ago for the 53rd anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery March and Bloody Sunday. This is where the SNCC house [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee’s Freedom House] was and it’s where the Black Panther Party was born. Today, many families — both white and black — are living with raw sewage in their yard. There is no sanitation service. There is a failing septic system. Thirty-five percent of the population has parasites or hookworm mostly because of poverty and failing infrastructure.We connected with leaders there. And they said that when you talk about civil rights or racial justice, you also have to talk about raw sewage, dilapidated housing and how we can make it possible for everybody to have a thriving, abundant life.

Miller was arrested on Monday for allegedly calling in a fake bomb threat on a train last month.The Blast first reported that authorities have charged Miller with intentionally conveying false information about an explosive device on a train to law enforcement.On March 18, Miller was aboard an Amtrak train traveling from Washington D.C. to New York. Authorities say the former “Silicon Valley” star called a 911 dispatcher in New Jersey to report that a female passenger with brown hair and a scarf had a bomb in her bag.After Miller told authorities he was on Train 2256, Amtrak officials stopped the train in Westport, Connecticut, and made passengers get off so bomb squad members could conduct a search.The team didn’t detect any evidence of an explosive device or materials on the train, according to a Department of Justice press release.Then it turned out that Miller was actually on Train 2258.An investigator said that when he contacted Miller by phone, he noticed the comedian was slurring his speech and asked him if he had consumed alcohol that day.Miller reportedly replied he had consumed “one glass of red wine.”The investigator said he asked Miller if he suffered from mental illness, and Miller allegedly replied, “No, absolutely not. This is the first time I’ve ever made a call like this before. I am worried for everyone on that train. Someone has to check that lady out.” Investigators inspected Train 2258 when it showed up at Westport, but found no explosive devices on board, according to the release.Amtrak officers then reportedly interviewed an attendant from the first class car, where Miller had been sitting. The attendant said the actor had appeared intoxicated upon boarding in Washington and consumed multiple drinks on the train. The attendant also told investigators that Miller had a few “hostile exchanges” with a woman sitting in the same first-class car.After interviewing the woman Miller had accused of carrying a bomb, investigators determined she was not carrying explosives or doing any of the things that Miller had claimed. Officials allege that Miller made up the bomb threat because of a grudge against the woman, causing 926 hours worth of delays and disrupting several law enforcement agencies and bomb squads in Connecticut and New York, according to TMZ.Authorities arrested Miller when he flew into LaGuardia Airport. He was released from custody on Tuesday morning after posting $100,000 bond.If convicted, Miller could spend up to five years in prison.HuffPost reached out to Miller’s reps, who did not immediately respond."

The council’s key mission: to improve the health and fitness of Americans ... including kids. Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling, a CNN analyst and physical fitness advocate, was appointed a member of the council in 2013 and served through the rest of the Obama administration. He points out that no one is on the council anymore:Early in his presidency, Donald Trump increased the number of members of the 60-year-old council from 25 to 30. (He also modified its name.) How many members has he actually appointed to the council? None. The federal government’s “Meet the Council” website tells visitors that members are still “to be announced.”Holli Richmond was appointed as executive director last month, but she has no one to meet with. Hertling wasn’t the only person to respond to Ivanka Trump’s tweet by mentioning former first lady Michelle Obama.While in the White House, Obama promoted children’s health through nutrition and physical activity with her “Let’s Move” campaign, launched in 2010. The Obama administration also instituted requirements for healthier school lunches, which Trump has postponed.Other Twitter users mentioned that children would probably be healthier if their health insurance wasn’t being whittled away and if they could have clean air and water.Hertling later shared a photo of some of the council’s members posing with former President Barack Obama in 2015. They never got to celebrate the group’s 60th anniversary, he noted."

The 31-year-old will square off against Adam Wieczorek on Saturday in Glendale, Arizona, and wear a turban ― a Sikh article of faith ― as he makes his way to the ring. He’ll be the first UFC fighter to do so.Gurwin Singh Ahuja, executive director of the National Sikh Campaign, told HuffPost he hopes Bhullar and his turban, also known as a dastaar, will raise awareness about the Sikh community. “A majority of Americans do not even know who Sikhs are!” Ahuja told HuffPost. ”I think Bhullar’s appearance will help introduce the broader public to the Sikh community, and I think his career will inform people that Sikhs are fighters and that we fight for equality.” Bhullar’s upcoming fight is particularly significant as it lands on Vaisahki, a festival that observes the founding of the body of fully initiated Sikhs known as the Khalsa.Bhullar, who in his UFC debut last September also became the group’s first fighter of Indian descent, hasn’t always been able to showcase his pride in his heritage. He had planned to wear his turban to his initial match, but UFC policies barred that.A UFC spokesman told HuffPost that Bhullar did not follow the group’s “approval process for a change in apparel. Once UFC was given more time to vet the request, approval was granted. Going forward, he will be allowed to walk to the octagon [ring] with a turban.”Bhullar told ESPN UK that the September incident “was disappointing and upsetting and frustrating.” He said that UFC officials needed “some educating and getting them on the same page, but I think we’ve done that.”Bhullar, who has a 7-0 record in his bouts, has said that his identity as an Indian-Canadian Sikh is central to who he is.His grandfather arrived in Canada from India in 1959 and faced racism because of his beard and turban, the fighter told the video show MMA Hour. Bhullar’s father took up wrestling as a way to protect himself at a time when the turban was not accepted, Vice Sports reported, and also used the sport as a way to connect with his peers.Bhullar himself represented Canada in wrestling at the 2012 Summer Games in London, before turning to the sport of mixed martial arts. Considering his family’s past and legacy, he said he has a duty to honor those before him. “I always try to represent, to be more than just an athlete, more than just your sport, I consider it selfish to be going in there and just fighting… So many people in my community have sacrificed for me to be in the position I’m at,” Bhullar told Global News. More than 60 percent of Americans knew nothing about Sikh Americans, a 2015 study revealed. The survey also found that when seeing someone wearing a turban, Americans were more likely to assume the individual was Muslim or Middle Eastern rather than Sikh. And according to the poll, more than half of Sikh children faced bullying in schools, with rates even more drastic for those wearing turbans. “It is frankly commonly associated with terrorism and religious extremism,” Ahuja said of the turban. Sikhs, though, wear it as a show of commitment to values that include service, compassion, and honesty. Ahuja said that with more visibility and representation, perhaps people will “correctly associate that the person who wears a turban will fight for equality and the rights of all people.”“We want UFC fans to know that ... for hundreds of years, Sikhs have fought, and many have given their lives, to protect the rights of others—including Hindus, Christians, and Muslims—to practice their own religions,” he said. “Ultimately, our turban represents our commitment to fight for those values.”This story has been updated with a statement from UFC.

The cable network was one of the first to report on a script blasting media bias that Sinclair pressured its local news anchors to read on air.Sinclair’s video, however, is fraught with misleading statements about the shifting concept of “fake news,” sending a disingenuous message to its viewers ― of which there are many. The broadcaster currently reaches around 40 percent of U.S. homes and is gearing up to acquire more stations, which would increase its reach to around 70 percent.Much of the video focuses its attack on Brian Stelter, CNN’s senior media correspondent. It begins with a March 7 clip in which Stelter said Sinclair had taken “a page out of Trump’s playbook” by forcing its journalists to read the controversial script, which criticized “false news” stories and reporters who “use their platforms to push their own personal bias and agenda.”Patching together CNN segments, the video attempts to show that Sinclair’s message to viewers about “false news” and Stelter’s warnings about “fake news” amount to the same thing ― and that CNN’s criticisms of Sinclair are thus dishonest.“Does CNN really think a warning about ‘Fake News’ is Trump’s rhetoric?” Sinclair asks.But the broadcaster’s video clearly ignores a whole lot of recent history and context. Sinclair begins by pointing out that Stelter and CNN warned viewers about fake news repeatedly in 2016 and 2017. As anyone with internet access can easily confirm, this is accurate. Many major media outlets began talking about made-up “news” stories as the 2016 election was heating up ― and particularly after BuzzFeed discovered a cabal of Macedonian teens who were churning out fake pro-Trump stories for the advertising revenue. (Pope Francis did not, for example, endorse Trump for president.)Sinclair suggests that this coverage was “a lot like what Sinclair anchors talked about in 2018” ― or what Sinclair made its anchors talk about in 2018 ― and, on the surface, it all does sound similar. But the larger picture is that the term “fake news” has been politicized since it was first used by journalists to describe objectively false stories made up by writers foreign and domestic. Today it is repeatedly applied to reporting on well-documented real events, such as the FBI’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, that some readers don’t want to believe ― often for partisan reasons ― and to news analysis that readers don’t agree with.This twist has been driven by Trump, who routinely slurs stories ― from crowd size to White House dysfunction ― that displease him. The president has even used the term on a human being, telling a CNN reporter, “You are fake news.”To Stelter, Sinclair’s on-air warning about “false news” is particularly troubling because the anchors were ordered to read it or risk their jobs ― a threat to press freedom.“Here’s the thing: These promos became a story because Sinclair staffers spoke up and said they were uncomfortable,” Stelter tweeted on Tuesday. “They said they’d never seen anything like this before.” Other journalists were quick to push back against Sinclair’s latest defense on Twitter, too.“Trump appropriated ‘fake news’ after the election to dismiss critical or unflattering coverage from legit news orgs,” Politico media reporter Michael Calderone wrote. “And he’s used the term throughout his presidency to suggest the public should trust him and not the press.”“It’s disingenuous to act like the ‘fake news’ [Stelter] was warning viewers about in 2016 and early 2017 is the same ‘fake news’ Sinclair is railing against today,” wrote Mediaite’s Justin Baragona.By now, “fake news” has become a slippery term with multiple definitions. In the script it made its employees recite, Sinclair doesn’t distinguish between the objectively false and the critically true, between genuine disagreements about the meaning of events and deliberate attempts to spin the truth ― and that’s the problem.

The pontiff said that while efforts to restrict abortion are crucial, it’s just as important for members of his flock to fight for the rights of the “already born.”“Our defense of the innocent unborn, for example, needs to be clear, firm and passionate,” Francis wrote in his exhortation. “Equally sacred, however, are the lives of the poor, those already born, the destitute, the abandoned and the underprivileged, the vulnerable infirm and elderly exposed to covert euthanasia, the victims of human trafficking, new forms of slavery, and every form of rejection.”“We cannot uphold an ideal of holiness that would ignore injustice in a world where some revel, spend with abandon and live only for the latest consumer goods, even as others look on from afar, living their entire lives in abject poverty,” the pope wrote.He added that he’s often heard Catholics talk about the plight of migrants as a “lesser issue,” compared to certain “bioethical” concerns. In what looked like an admonishment of anti-refugee sentiment among Christians in Europe and the U.S., Francis condemned the idea that defending migrants should be a secondary concern.“That a politician looking for votes might say such a thing is understandable, but not a Christian, for whom the only proper attitude is to stand in the shoes of those brothers and sisters of ours who risk their lives to offer a future to their children,” he wrote. “Can we not realize that this is exactly what Jesus demands of us, when he tells us that in welcoming the stranger we welcome him?” he asked, pointing to Matthew 25:35.An apostolic exhortation is one way the pope can formally counsel the Roman Catholic Church around the world. The document released Monday, titled “Gaudete et Exsultate” (Rejoice and Be Glad), is the third such exhortation of Francis’ papacy. It was signed March 19, The Associated Press reports.The pope’s focus this time was calling on Catholics to live holy lives and be the “saints next door” ― ordinary, humble people who reflect God’s presence by living out the Beatitudes, key Christian teachings about mercy and spirituality. These “saints next door” may not be canonized and officially recognized, but they raise their children with love and work hard to support their families. They are patient, kind and charitable, using small gestures to share God’s love with others. Holiness isn’t necessarily about perfection, Francis explained, but about “living our lives with love and ... bearing witness in everything we do, wherever we find ourselves.”The enemies of this everyday holiness are those who “worship” their own abilities and feel superior to others because they observe certain rules, Francis wrote. The fruits of that misguided attitude are, among other things, “an obsession with the law, an absorption with social and political advantages, [and] a punctilious concern for the Church’s liturgy, doctrine and prestige.”Francis criticized those who focus only on doctrine without also demonstrating mercy and compassion.“Not infrequently, contrary to the promptings of the Spirit, the life of the Church can become a museum piece or the possession of a select few. This can occur when some groups of Christians give excessive importance to certain rules, customs or ways of acting,” Francis wrote. “The Gospel then tends to be reduced and constricted, deprived of its simplicity, allure and savor.”Francis is still facing backlash over his second exhortation, the 2016 “Amoris Laetitia” (The Joy of Love), which appeared to suggest that divorced and civilly remarried Catholics could potentially receive Communion. That would be a break from long-standing Catholic tradition. Conservative cardinals and bishops have been pressing Francis to clarify his stance on the matter. Just last Saturday, several hundred Catholics gathered for a summit in Rome to discuss who may receive Communion. The participants rejected the idea of allowing divorced and civilly remarried individuals to do so and urged “the pope and the bishops to confirm us in the faith.” One of Francis’ fiercest American critics, Cardinal Raymond Burke, said during the summit that the pope should be corrected if he steps outside the traditional teachings of the church.Francis hasn’t responded directly to those critics with a clarification of “Amoris Laetitia.” But in his latest exhortation, he said that within the Catholic Church, “there legitimately coexist different ways of interpreting many aspects of doctrine and Christian life.”These different interpretations may trouble those who long for a “monolithic body of doctrine guarded by all,” but Francis wrote they “help to express more clearly the immense riches of God’s word.”"

Steven Hart, whose firm represents several fossil fuels companies.Apol also raised concerns about Pruitt’s use of taxpayer dollars for travel, security and some of his employees’ salaries. Pruitt’s frequent and expensive trips to and from his home state of Oklahoma were the subject of an EPA inspector general probe last year. Pruitt has also been scrutinized over his security detail, which includes roughly 20 full-time, round-the-clock security guards ― three times as many as his predecessor had.The EPA should also investigate whether employees were “reassigned or demoted” for challenging Pruitt’s potentially unethical behavior, Apol wrote. The Times reported last month that at least five EPA officials were “reassigned or demoted, or requested new jobs” after raising questions about Pruitt’s “spending and management.”“If true, it is hard to imagine any action that could more effectively undermine an agency’s integrity than punishing or marginalizing employees who strive to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations that safeguard that integrity,” Apol wrote in his letter to the EPA.Minoli responded to Apol’s request with a letter of his own, stating that EPA’s ethics officials lack “independent investigatory authority.” “We referred your letter to the EPA [Inspector General],” Minoli wrote. “As always, the EPA’s office stands ready to assist the IG in any way.”A representative from the EPA’s Office of the Inspector General did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. The Office of Government Ethics does not have the authority to discipline Pruitt, the Times noted, though the agency can request that President Donald Trump punish a federal official found to be in violation of ethics rules.Pruitt has come under fire for at least 23 ethics issues, and the White House announced Friday that it would conduct a review of Pruitt’s conduct. But Trump has defended his EPA head, tweeting Friday that Pruitt was “doing a great job.”Democratic lawmakers and a handful of Republicans, including Reps. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.) and Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), have called on Pruitt to resign in the wake of his ethics scandals.On Monday, Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) requested a federal investigation into whether two top Pruitt aides’ raises violated multiple federal laws. This article has been updated with Minoli’s response. "

The state’s reinsurance pool has helped reduce premiums on the exchange by 15 percent in 2018.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5acb74232000008106eb4390.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Michael OlloveA couple of years ago, the health insurance exchange in Minnesota – MNsure – was in deep trouble. Health insurance premiums for individual policies had shot up by as much as 67 percent, among the steepest increases in the country. Insurers were abandoning the market, leaving 116,000 Minnesotans with scant choices.The Minnesota Legislature offered a solution: a $271 million, publicly funded reinsurance pool that would help health insurance companies pay the most expensive medical claims, thereby lowering overall insurance premiums. The hope was that backstopping the insurers would stabilize the market and halt the rocket-like rise in premiums.So far, so very good. In its first year, the reinsurance pool has performed even better than expected. According to the Urban Institute, 2018 premiums offered on MNsure not only didn’t increase, they fell by 15 percent.Minnesota’s peers are paying attention. The Gopher State is one of four states trying to calm roiling health insurance markets by creating state reinsurance pools – even as actions by Congress and the Trump administration continue to create uncertainty in the health insurance industry.Maryland became the latest to do so when Republican Gov. Larry Hogan last week signed a bill creating a reinsurance pool financed in part in the next year by a $380 million tax on health insurers. Another six states are taking steps to launch their own reinsurance programs.Reinsurance has long had a place in the private insurance market.Essentially, it entails insurance companies taking out their own insurance to protect themselves when they are hit by an unexpectedly high claim, “like when somebody needs a heart transplant or a liver transplant or something else where costs are over, say, $100,000,” said Brad Herring, a health economist at the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University.A public health reinsurance plan works the same way, except the state reimburses insurers for claims that climb above a certain set figure, depending on the plan.In Minnesota’s reinsurance program, health insurers are eligible for reimbursements from the state for claims between $50,000 and $250,000. The insurers are responsible for amounts over $250,000.Allison O’Toole, MNsure’s CEO, said Minnesota acted in response to soaring premium increases and the departure of insurers such as Blue Cross and Blue Shield, the largest seller of individual policies in Minnesota at the time. No insurers have left the Minnesota market since the reinsurance pool launched.“We were taking it on the chin. We were really in crisis,” O’Toole said. “This has provided immediate and positive results.”Alaska, which created a reinsurance pool in 2016, also saw a year-to-year decrease in premiums. A third state, Oregon, authorized the creation of a reinsurance program last fall, but that action came after the premiums had already been set for 2018.But the fix in Minnesota is temporary. The Legislature ponied up about quarter of a billion dollars for two years, with a roughly equivalent amount expected to come from the federal government. But, O’Toole says, that state support won’t last.“Minnesota had a significant budget reserve a year ago, so we had money for it,” O’Toole said. “We won’t have that going forward.”That is why O’Toole and many other state officials want the federal government to help fill state reinsurance pools.Health policy analysts say the situation has only grown more pressing in recent months.In December, Congress eliminated the so-called individual mandate as part of the new tax law, meaning that healthy people – who would pay premiums but be unlikely to need expensive care – can now opt out of insurance. And the Trump administration scrapped federal subsidies that were worth about $7 billion a year to insurance companies. Analysts say those actions are likely to lead to higher premiums for those remaining on the individual market and increased financial pressure on insurers.There were two bipartisan bills in the Senate – one cosponsored by Republican Susan Collins of Maine and Democrat Bill Nelson of Florida, and the other by Republican Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Democrat Patty Murray of Washington – that would have sent $5 billion a year to the states to finance their reinsurance pools. But neither was incorporated into the spending bill that Trump signed last month.Avalere, a health policy research firm, estimated that the measure pushed by Collins and Nelson would have reduced 2019 premiums by 4 percent and increased enrollment in Affordable Care Act plans by 180,000. Not surprisingly, the bill had the strong support of the health insurance industry.Although the Senate bills had considerable bipartisan support, there was significant opposition too. “This bailout approach is wrong and should be abandoned,” a report published last month by the conservative Heritage Foundation said. “It is fiscally imprudent and unnecessary.” It is the ACA’s “radical regulatory overreach,” that has caused chaos in the health insurance market, the report says.At the same time, many left-leaning analysts say public reinsurance is yet another cumbersome solution to a fractured health care system that should be replaced by a single-payer model.The Affordable Care Act set up a federal reinsurance pool to compensate insurers for taking on high-risk beneficiaries (who, under ACA provisions, could not be charged higher premiums than anyone else). The law set aside $20 billion, funded largely by a tax on insurers, for the years 2014 through 2016. After that, the pool disappeared, and the determination of congressional Republicans to repeal the ACA made renewal of the program a political impossibility.States that want to establish their own reinsurance pools with some federal money must apply for a waiver from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to depart from some provisions of the ACA while still providing comprehensive, affordable health coverage.In their applications to create reinsurance pools, states have argued that by reducing premiums, they will save the federal government money because it will have to pay less in tax credits for low-income policyholders.Alaska created its reinsurance pool with $55 million from a tax on insurers, but it subsequently applied for and received a federal waiver, which is expected to bring in about $58 million in federal money. The state is hoping that because its individual insurance market is so small – about 23,000 people – the federal contribution will negate the need for it to put state money into the pool.Oregon has committed $1.1 billion in state money, also raised through a tax on insurers, over 10 years and is hoping to receive $356 million in federal money during that period.In February Wisconsin enacted a $200 million law that, should the federal government grant a waiver, will funnel $30 million to $50 million in state money into a reinsurance pool with the federal government picking up the rest. Democrats joined Republicans in favor of the bill in both houses. The main opposition came from the progressive group, Citizen Action of Wisconsin, which called the reinsurance plan a bailout for insurance companies.In Colorado, an early analysis projected that if the state had spent $177 million to create a reinsurance pool in 2018 and received $119 million in federal money, premiums would have declined by 21 percent. Colorado lawmakers are working on a reinsurance pool proposal.But some financially strapped states simply don’t have the money to set up reinsurance pools. In 2018, Minnesota’s pool will total $271 million: $140 million in state money and $131 million in federal dollars.

In an interview with Variety, the “Saturday Night Live” alum explained how the original spirit of the film had to evolve to include social media.“The movie was about relational aggression among women,” Fey told Variety. “But now that behavior has really metastasized across our society, and you see it everywhere. You see it in people being horrible to each other on social media. So if anything, it’s gone wider.”Fey worked with lyricist Nell Benjamin and director Casey Nicholaw to create “Mean Girls” for the stage. The musical’s composer is Jeff Richmond, who also happens to be Fey’s husband.Richmond said social media elements had to be added, because otherwise “you would immediately know that [the story] was not of the present.”The updated story includes additions like internet memes, cyberbullying and Twitter. Like the film, the musical is all about the chaos of high school."

Gen. H.R. McMaster, according to a Republican close to the White House. Other changes are likely to follow, the source said, with Bolton expected to purge staff in order to bring in others more loyal to him, as well as to carry out a top priority for Trump: ridding the NSC of those suspected of “leaking” information to the news media.Anton, the source added, was the likeliest source of one of the most humiliating leaks for Trump in recent weeks: the disclosure to The Washington Post that Trump had specifically been warned, in all capital letters, “DO NOT CONGRATULATE” Vladimir Putin on securing another term as Russia’s president. That warning came prior to a phone call with the Russian leader following an election that was widely criticized as illegitimate. Trump congratulated him anyway.Anton could not be reached for comment. Queries to his White House email address and phone number went unanswered.The White House disputed the idea that Anton’s departure was a condition of Bolton taking the job or even that Bolton had wanted him gone by the time he began his job on Monday.A White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said Anton’s resignation was based on a “reasonable” assumption that Bolton would want to bring in his own team at the NSC. Anton, the official said, had been looking for a new job for some months, starting about the time Trump began making clear that he was unhappy with McMaster.The official even more emphatically denied that Anton leaked the now-infamous “DO NOT CONGRATULATE” instruction, calling that allegation “definitely not true.”Bolton, 69, is now the third national security adviser to serve under Trump since the president took office 15 months ago. The first, retired Army Gen. Michael Flynn, left after a month because of his lies to federal investigators in the Russia probe. He has since pleaded guilty.McMaster, who plans to retire from the Army this summer, lasted a year, but his traditional foreign policy views that included a hard line against Russian expansionism clashed with Trump’s more Putin-friendly approach.Bolton last served in government as United Nations ambassador under President George W. Bush. A veteran of the State and Justice departments, Bolton became known for his readiness to undermine co-workers who disagreed with his interventionist foreign policy views. The animosity was such that fellow State Department officials testified against Bolton at his confirmation hearing for the ambassadorship. Bolton did not win Senate confirmation and took the job in a recess appointment.Bolton had been considered for a Trump administration position during the transition, but ultimately did not join then. One of the reasons, reportedly, was that Trump did not like Bolton’s large, bushy mustache. But in the past year, Bolton has been among the loudest pro-Trump voices on Fox News, which Trump frequently watches and on which he bases many of his policy views.Anton also worked in the George W. Bush administration, but later came to view some of Bush’s foreign policy efforts ― such as the invasion and occupation of Iraq ― as misguided failures. He became an anonymous but vocal Trump supporter during the 2016 campaign, famously writing in one essay that supporting Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was akin to playing Russian roulette with a semiautomatic, while supporting Trump offered the country at least a small chance of survival."

Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.). So far, groups connected to Illinois-based billionaire Dick Uihlein have dominated the airwaves on behalf of Republican candidate Kevin Nicholson. But last week, another billionaire’s money went on the air in the heated GOP primary.Wisconsin Next PAC is out with a new ad supporting state Sen. Leah Vukmir ― the first pro-Vukmir ad run by a super PAC. The spot plays up her association with Gov. Scott Walker (R). Wisconsin Next PAC has received $500,000 from billionaire businesswoman Diane Hendricks, who is also backing Vukmir. It’s also received $25,000 from an employee of ABC Supply, the roofing distributor that Hendricks chairs. The super PAC is spending $575,000 to run the ad statewide on television and another $50,000 for digital spots. Vukmir has the support of much of the GOP establishment in Wisconsin, including Walker. Nicholson is a less traditional candidate. Previously, he was best known politically for chairing the College Democrats of America and speaking at the 2000 Democratic convention. Since then, the Iraq and Afghanistan war veteran has moved to the right and picked up support from the Club for Growth, a group that promotes fiscal conservative policies.Baldwin is already facing more outside spending by conservative groups than all other Democratic senators on the ballot this year combined. Republicans see the progressive Democrat as a prime target in a state that Trump won in 2016. With Walker up for re-election in November as well, they’re hoping that GOP voters turn out to counter the energy on the left. Republicans in Wisconsin have received some warning signs. In January, Democrat Patty Schachtner won a state Senate seat in a district that Trump won by 17 points. Republicans had held the seat since 2001. And last week, for the first time in 23 years, a liberal candidate won an open Supreme Court seat in the state. Correction: This piece originally stated that ABC Supply had given $25,000 to Wisconsin Next PAC. The donation came from an employee at the company."

The band wishes Lindsey all the best,” the group said in a short statement to TMZ.In a separate statement, original member Mick Fleetwood told Variety:Fleetwood Mac has always been about an amazing collection of songs that are performed with a unique blend of talents. We jammed with Mike and Neil and the chemistry really worked and let the band realize that this is the right combination to go forward with in Fleetwood Mac style. We know we have something new, yet it’s got the unmistakable Mac sound.Last week, rumors began to swirl around like one of Stevie Nicks’ stage outfits that Buckingham might be leaving the band after Billy Burnette, who replaced the guitarist during his first decade-long hiatus, wrote in a now-deleted tweet: “Breaking news: Lindsey Buckingham is out but I’m not in. A little pissed off but I’ll get over it.”Buckingham and Nicks, who were then a couple, joined Fleetwood Mac in 1974. The guitarist helped propel the band to fame by writing and singing such notable hits as “Go Your Own Way,” “Tusk” and “Second Hand News.” He had earlier left in 1987 and returned in 1997.Buckingham’s representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

He's supposed to get congressional approval for that, though.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5acbc06a1f0000280616cb45.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump said on Monday he is not ruling out missile strikes against the government of President Bashar al-Assad in response to a suspected chemical weapons attack in Syria.If he does take military action, he’ll be doing so without constitutionally required approval by Congress.It’s Congress’ job to authorize any sustained U.S. military action. The problem is that lawmakers have been largely ignoring this mandate since 2001, when they passed a sweeping authorization for use of military force, or AUMF, allowing President George W. Bush to attack anyone connected to al Qaeda, anywhere, at any time.That AUMF never expired. For years, President Barack Obama stretched its limits by arguing it allowed him to take military action against the Islamic State, since the terror group is an offshoot of al Qaeda. Now, if Trump were to argue he could use the Iraq War-era authorization to bomb Syrian government targets, he would have to make the case that it’s related to al Qaeda, which it is not. The prospect of Trump unilaterally taking military action is troubling to lawmakers in both parties who say that it’s time to finally get rid of the 2001 AUMF and pass a new one with more narrowly tailored limits on scope, duration and costs of military action. They say the old AUMF is effectively a blank check for endless war.“The use of chemical weapons absolutely requires a response from the United States,” Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) said in a statement. “But if that response is going to include military force, the president of the United States should come to Congress and ask for authorization before military force is used.”“President Trump has to come to Congress for approval if he wants to take further U.S. military action,” Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) said in a statement. “A year since the administration’s last airstrikes in Syria, we know there is a secret memo that details how the Trump administration views its power to take military action without consulting Congress. It’s past time for the administration to share its Syria strategy with the public and release that memo before it’s used to justify more airstrikes or new wars.”Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) tweeted about it, too.A mix of rank-and-file lawmakers has been urging party leaders for years to get moving on a new AUMF, but nothing has happened. Most members of Congress simply don’t want to take a tough vote on authorizing war.It would incredibly difficult to justify using the 2001 AUMF for military action against the Assad government. The Trump administration hasn’t even tried to do it. When Trump directed strikes on a Syrian government airbase in April 2017 ― the first-ever direct military strike by the U.S. against Assad’s regime ― the administration claimed he had that authority under his presidential powers because it was limited military action, not because of the Iraq War-era AUMF.A fresh round of missile strikes in Syria makes this something different than a limited single engagement. And lawyers at the nonpartisan Protect Democracy say it would likely lead to larger and ongoing conflicts, which sounds a lot more like a war than a surgical attack.That’s what’s at the heart of lawmakers’ concerns with Trump acting without first getting their approval.“Before President Trump even considers taking the United States down a path of unilateral military action, the American people need answers. What does this administration hope to accomplish? What’s the end game?” asked Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.). “Are we moving from fighting ISIS to fighting Assad outright? Or are we withdrawing our troops and airpower from the region? In the space of a few days, the president has said both.”Trump said Monday that he’ll make his decision in the next 24 to 48 hours on how to respond to the latest suspected use of chemical weapons by Assad, which reportedly killed at least 49 people in a Damascus suburb.“Nothing’s off the table,” Trump told reporters."

News co-host spoke to HuffPost about her fight to end pay inequality and why more men need to get involved.,2018-04-09,"Catt Sadler has become an advocate for equal pay. Here, she attends the 2018 Vanity Fair Oscar Party on March 4, 2018, in Beverly Hills, California.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ac7db582000002d00eb41bf.jpeg?cache=OMLMTSwszh&ops=crop_7_144_3593_1989%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Catt Sadler is a woman on a mission.The E! News co-host resigned in December after she says she found out her male counterpart had been making “close to double” her salary. Now, she’s using her experience to raise awareness of pay inequality ahead of Equal Pay Day on April 10. Sadler talked with HuffPost, in partnership with Luna Bar, about her “highly unexpected” resignation, what it’s been like to become one of the most public faces of equal pay, and how she’s fighting to make sure fewer women have to go through what she did.Sadler, who worked at the entertainment network for close to a decade, hasn’t let her job loss slow her down. Instead, she said it has galvanized her into action. “I’m now really leaning into it because I know of the need for faces and voices and activists doing their part to make a change,” Sadler said of her newfound role. “I feel honored, in a sense. Every choice I’m making and career move that I am engaging in is in line with all of this.”Sadler said she was overwhelmed by the “massive” support she received after she quit her E! job. “It really affirmed that it’s not my story it is hundreds of thousands of women’s stories, who are making 80 cents on the dollar compared to what men are making,” she said. “Sometimes it’s worse if you’re a Latina woman or a black woman ― the statistics are even more glaringly bad.” White women make close to 80 cents for every white man’s dollar, while Latina women make 54 cents, and black women make 63 cents, according to a 2018 report from the American Association of University Women. On average, Asian women make 87 cents to every white man’s dollar. While equal pay is an important topic, it’s sometimes hard to discuss because so many factors contribute to pay inequality. Race, ethnicity, geography, age and privilege are components that can make the pay gap convoluted and complex. To simplify the comparison, Sadler said there’s one tool women in all industries can use today to combat pay inequality. “The thing that stands out the most to me is transparency. I feel like it’s been so incredibly taboo, it’s the one thing that is not talked about,” she said. “People walk around and nobody knows who’s making what or why. You look at the sports industry and everybody knows what Tom Brady’s making, right? What you make has been this dark little secret. I’m a living-breathing example of that, I just had no idea.”Sadler pointed to the recent coverage of pay disparity between Hollywood stars in big films like “All The Money In The World” and Netflix’s “The Crown.”“I like what I see so far just in the last year of more and more news stories and things that are hitting the media and the companies that are at least responding to that,” she said. “I think companies are going to start responding in ways that they haven’t been pressured to in the past, and that’s huge. ... With more and more responses to what’s happening, I think we’ll be left with change.”Another piece of the puzzle is men. Male allies are integral in the fight, Sadler said. “I’d like to hear from more guys, we’re all on the same team at the end of the day,” said Sadler, who noted she’s raising two boys of her own. “You know you look back at red carpet season even a little bit, and a lot of women were finally having this platform to use their voices and that was wonderful. But I would’ve liked to have heard from more men. I would’ve liked that question pointed at the guys. Because, again, we’re all in this together. I would ask men to continue to speak up and if they’re not already, please start.”Although structural changes are needed to close the pay gap, Sadler said women’s livelihoods are “ultimately up to us.”“I’m a journalist. I’m educated. I read a lot. But I wasn’t even aware until it happened to me,” Sadler said of the pay gap. “So I think it’s important for everybody, regardless of race or gender ― the guys too ― to invest enough to really become aware. Because at the end of the day, when women make more money, everybody ― society as a whole ― benefits.”"
39,POLITICS,Details Hazy On 'Death Threats' Against EPA's Scott Pruitt,Mary Papenfuss,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/details-hazy-on-death-threats-against-epas-scott-pruitt_us_5acabfeae4b0337ad1e9624b,"One supposed threat was a postcard calling Pruitt ""ignorant.""",2018-04-09,Washington Post request to the EPA on any information about death threats against Scott Pruitt.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5acac1642000002d00eb42e7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump cites “death threats” to justify the $3 million round-the-clock security detail for Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt, who cites his own security to justify lavish spending on first-class air travel.But details about any threats to Pruitt are sparse. One supposed threat that was investigated was a postcard to Pruitt with the message: “You ignorant fuck,” according to EPA records. Authorities also investigated two protesters who interrupted a speech by Pruitt.The EPA said there were “zero records” about death threats in reply to BuzzFeed investigative reporter Jason Leopold’s request for all information. The Washington Post sought records under the Freedom of Information Act late last year, asking for “copies of all emails, letters, voicemails and other communication in which Administrator Pruitt was threatened with violence or which were otherwise considered to be threatening to the administrator.” The EPA’s answer, dated early December, was “undetermined,” with “no records released.”The Associated Press reported last week that its “nationwide search of federal and state court records ... found no case where anyone has been arrested or charged with threatening Pruitt.” The EPA did not respond to AP’s request Friday to provide details of “any specific threats or arrests.”The EPA official in charge of investigating threats ― assistant inspector general for investigations Patrick Sullivan ― would not specify the number of threats that had been logged against Pruitt. But he said in a September interview with E&E News that there were more investigations into threats against Pruitt than for either of his two immediate predecessors.“I can tell you there’s more than three” investigations, Sullivan said. “That’s for sure.”Sullivan told CNN in November there were “four to five times” more threats against Pruitt than his immediate predecessor, but refused to elaborate. The EPA requested that Pruitt’s security detail be beefed up soon after he took office. Some $3 million has now been spent on Pruitt’s 20-man round-the-clock protection. In addition, Pruitt’s aides often cite security to justify huge first-class airfare expenses. The spending is part of a long series of ethical problems plaguing the EPA chief.Here are some alleged threats against Pruitt that were investigated, according to reports:― The EPA inspector general in March 2017 investigated a postcard sent to the EPA that said: “Get out while you still can, Scott,” “You ignorant fuck,” and “You are evil incarnite,” according to a report obtained by E&E. EPA investigators discussed the message with the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force. But they couldn’t identify the author and concluded the message “lacked a clear threat.”― Another postcard included “an implied threat that contained obscene language,” Sullivan told E&E. “It was not a direct threat.” The U.S. attorney’s office declined to prosecute, and the writer of the message apologized when contacted by federal officials, said Sullivan.― “Threatening tweets” against Pruitt and Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) were investigated in April 2017. The writer told investigators he wrote the “flippant comments” while drinking and watching “The Rachel Maddow Show,” and had no intention of hurting anyone. He apologized, and a U.S. attorney’s office declined to press charges.― The EPA launched a criminal probe in April 2017 into two female protesters who interrupted a speech by Pruitt. Officials submitted information for misdemeanor charges, but no action was taken.― The head of the EPA’s Office of Criminal Enforcement told Politico in February that Pruitt’s safety was threatened when people yelled obscenities at him.Sullivan said investigations had been launched into 40 threats against EPA “personnel and facilities” in 2017, according to E&E. He told NBC a month later the number was 70 investigations.Three investigations were launched into threats against Pruitt’s predecessor, Gina McCarthy, but none against President Barack Obama’s first EPA chief, Lisa Jackson, according to records. One letter to McCarthy threatened: “We will hurt you and your family.” Sullivan used a version of the same quote as an example of a threat to Pruitt in his interview with CNN.Fox News reported Friday that Pruitt has received an “unprecedented” number of death threats.“According to EPA’s assistant inspector general, Scott Pruitt has faced an unprecedented amount of death threats against him and his family,” Fox quoted EPA spokesman Jahan Wilcox as saying. Wilcox’s statement “included a list of several published reports about such incidents,” Fox reported, without providing details. "

Rochelle was quickly stopped by police before she could reach Cosby and taken into custody. The words “women’s lives matter” were written in red on Rochelle’s unclothed chest and the names of Cosby’s accusers were written in black all over her body. NBC Philadelphia reports that she was accompanied by another half-dozen protesters.According to IMDb, Rochelle (also known as Nicole Leach) is a former actress from Little Falls, New Jersey, who appeared in four episodes of “The Cosby Show” between 1990 and 1992. She’s also appeared on such shows as “Clarissa Explains It All” and “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.” The 39-year-old was charged with disorderly conduct, which can result in a fine. Warning: Some images below contain nudity. Cosby is charged with three counts of aggravated indecent assault. He’s accused of drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand, a former women’s basketball coach at Temple University, in 2004. In June last year, a jury failed to reach a unanimous decision on the charges and the judge declared a mistrial.More than 50 women have accused the veteran entertainer of sexual assault, with many saying he drugged and raped them. Cosby has denied all the allegations and is sticking with his not-guilty plea from last year. Scroll below to see more from journalists on the scene. Cosby’s retrial is the first high-profile sexual assault prosecution in the Me Too era. The case has garnered a lot of media coverage and many activists have vowed to protest outside the courthouse throughout the trial, which is expected to run at least a month.Other women’s groups are demonstrating in front of the courthouse to ensure that sexual assault survivors’ voices are heard. “Women simply are not getting justice and our entire system is failing women and in turn failing our entire society,” Sonia Ossorio, the president of the National Organization for Women New York City, told reporters outside the courthouse Monday morning.

It didn’t take long for fans to do the math. “You deserve better, girl. Trust me, he will regret in the future,” one fan commented on Moretz’s Instagram. “YOU ARE BETTER WITHOUT HIM.”“Y’all literally don’t know how, why or when they ended their relationship and whether or not she fell out of love before he did,” another added. “He has every right to kiss anyone (given the consent) even if it’s within a minute they broke up.”Moretz and Beckham, the son of soccer player David Beckham and Spice Girls singer Victoria, have been linked together since 2014, but have taken breaks in the past. The actress reluctantly confirmed their relationship in an awkward exchange on “Watch What Happens Live” in September 2016.“He’s a very good guy. He’s a good person,” Moretz told the podcast’s host, Andy Cohen. “I enjoy hanging out with him.”After taking some time apart, the two were decidedly back on as of September, and haven’t exactly been shy about their social media PDA since. They’ve laid low in recent weeks, but were photographed kissing in March while celebrating Beckham’s 19th birthday. “Never Stop Smiling, I Love You, Happy Birthday Brooklyn 🎈♥️,” Moretz captioned a black-and-white photo of him on the big day. Beckham shared a similarly affectionate post for the actress’ birthday in February, writing, “love you to the moon and back.”Ah, young love in young Hollywood almost never lasts. "

Lots of other people apparently had the same idea. “It was car after car after car after car trying to pick up water,” Bradley, 53, told HuffPost. She picked up the eight cases she uses to cook, the maximum amount a resident can receive per day.On Friday, the state of Michigan announced that the quality of Flint’s water was “restored” and the water therefore as safe to drink as in other big cities. It also said the state government would no longer provide bottled water to city residents.Yet some locals aren’t convinced their taps are safe. After all, the government downplayed the contamination four years ago, even after the water had turned brown. “If you know the story behind how we got in this situation like we did, I think you can understand why we the people do not trust those who are supposed to be looking out for the best interests of all of [Flint’s] residents,” said Bradley, a speech therapist who takes care of her elderly mother.Due to bad oversight by the state, toxic lead started poisoning Flint’s water in April 2014. Lead exposure can cause brain damage in young children and miscarriages in women; researchers have documented both increased lead in Flint kids and a possible increase in fetal deaths.Since the state admitted its mistake and took corrective action at the end of 2014, the government has closely monitored the city’s water. For nearly two years, lead levels have been below the federal “action level,” but until Friday, officials seemed hesitant to declare the water safe. “For the past two years I have repeatedly been asked when I would declare the water safe in Flint and I have always said that no arbitrary decision would be made — that we would let the science take us to that conclusion,” Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R) said in a statement.But the decision to discontinue bottled water delivery is contrary to available science, said Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, whose research exposed the spike in Flint kids’ blood lead levels and forced the state to admit its mistake. Flint is currently replacing the thousands of lead pipes connecting water mains to people’s homes, making it only the third city to undertake wholesale lead pipe removal after Lansing, Michigan and Madison, Wisconsin. But Hanna-Atisha says research has shown that pipe replacement and even street work can temporarily increase the amount of lead coming out of household faucets because vibrations from the construction can dislodge lead particles in the pipes. The work in Flint won’t be finished until later next year at the earliest.“This is a period of increased risk,” said Hanna-Attisha, who is now the director of the Pediatric Public Health Initiative, a joint effort by Michigan State University and Hurley Children’s Hospital.A spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality pointed out that the state will continue to provide water filters that are effective for removing lead. Jason Rogers, a 42-year-old program coordinator for a local youth mentoring organization, had one word for the governor’s declaration that the water is restored. It’s “bullshit,” he told HuffPost. “Rick Snyder would not live here and drink this water.” Rogers, who works with about three dozen Flint kids on a daily basis, explained that the free bottled water program has become a “feature of our reality.” “We don’t talk about [the water] too much because, like I said, it’s just our reality now, but I’ve heard [the kids] talk about how they still have to prepare meals with the bottled water,” he said. “They still, for the most part, use the bottled water for the major aspects of their lives.” Flint Mayor Karen Weaver (D) said she learned of the decision to shutter the bottled water program only moments before the public announcement. State Rep. Sheldon Neeley (D) received a phone call about the cancellation of the program 30 minutes prior to the governor’s announcement. “From what they told me, I don’t believe any of the state representatives had any prior information to this happening,” he told HuffPost.Neeley grew up in Flint. His family has been getting its bottled water from one of several distribution sites known as “pods.” The pods are slated to close once their water supplies run out. “It was traumatic for the city of Flint to find out that the water source was not safe to drink four years ago,” Neeley said. “It’s equally as traumatic, or a revisitation of the trauma, when they take away what people believe is a lifeline for them. The state of Michigan and the governor’s administration has ignored the particular trauma they have inflicted on the community.”It’s been more than 1,400 days since the start of Flint’s water crisis. Even though the governor and independent scientists have insisted the water is safe as long as it’s filtered, and even though the governor now says the water is comparable to what people drink in other cities, the entire ordeal has residents unsure if they can ever trust their local government ever again.Many Flint residents have said the city received substandard treatment from the state partly because a majority its residents are African-American.“To me, this is a clear example of environmental racism,” Bradley said.

I don’t know — I’ve never really been interviewed about this before.”Though Jacobson stopped short of using “lesbian,” “bisexual” or other labels, she told Liebman she’s open to being approached by prospective suitors, both male and female. “Yeah, who knows? The world is my oyster,” she quipped. Jacobson, who is at work on an Amazon series based on the 1992 baseball classic, “A League of Their Own,” has faced media speculation about her sexuality before. In 2016, rumors swirled about the nature of her relationship with “Portlandia” star Carrie Brownstein. Brownstein, for the record, identifies as bisexual. Meanwhile, Jacobson and “Broad City” co-star Ilana Glazer will appear as guest judges on another beloved queer-themed staple, “RuPaul’s Drag Race.” Jacobson was tight-lipped about the specifics of their appearance in her chat with Vanity Fair, noting, “It’s pretty much under lock and key over there.”Still, she added, “I know roughly when it airs because, as a judge, I know how many contestants are left.

Duncan Hunter, whom Butner is running to unseat in Southern California’s 50th Congressional District.As its name suggests, the site tries to paint Butner, a 49-year-old rancher, school board member and Navy SEAL veteran, as virtually indistinguishable from Hunter. It claims that Republicans recruited Butner to run in order to divide the Democratic vote and that the National Republican Congressional Committee has raised money for him.But the website goes further, claiming that Butner’s father “has been linked to the KKK.”Francis Lan Nguyen, Butner’s campaign manager, dismissed the idea that Butner is anything other than a loyal Democrat. The campaign also denied that Butner’s father, Joe Butner III, a retired county judge in Arizona, has ever been associated with white supremacist hate groups.The NRCC categorically denied supporting Butner as well.“Why would we recruit a Dem to run against an incumbent R?” NRCC spokesman Jesse Hunt said in an email.The “Duncan Butner” website also maligns several members of Butner’s campaign staff, asking why Nguyen would work for Butner considering Butner’s supposed opposition to gay rights. It claims that Nguyen has been a “proud member of the LGBTQ community all of his adult life.”In fact, Butner vocally supports all LGBTQ rights, including the right of transgender people to serve in the military, according to Nguyen. Nguyen is also a straight cisgender male, he told HuffPost.New Politics, which helps elect veterans and other national service participants, and is backing Butner’s bid, called on Butner’s opponents, including progressive rival Ammar Campa-Najjar, to denounce the site.The site appears to be the work of a Campa-Najjar supporter, since its “call to action” redirects users to a web page listing candidates endorsed by the California Democratic Party, including Campa-Najjar. And Campa-Najjar once dubbed Hunter and Butner “Duncan Butner” in a now-deleted Facebook post slamming a Butner campaign ad.“Lying about Josh because of his service to our country and maligning young people on his team who dedicate themselves to a political campaign does nothing to strengthen our democracy — instead it drives us apart and weakens our country,” said Emily Cherniack, founder and executive director at New Politics.VoteVets, a liberal veterans group backing Butner, also called on Campa-Najjar to condemn the site.And Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), whose pro-veteran Serve America PAC has endorsed Butner, also tweeted out a fundraising appeal for Butner. His political staff confirmed that the message was a response to the anti-Butner website.Campa-Najjar, a 29-year-old small business owner and veteran of the Obama administration, told HuffPost on Monday that he had no knowledge of the site and had nothing to do with its creation. “Whoever did it should take it down,” Campa-Najjar said.Upon looking at the site, Campa-Najjar pronounced it “disgusting.”The Butner campaign refused to take Campa-Najjar’s word for it. In a Tuesday statement to reporters, Butner demanded that Campa-Najjar “come clean” about the matter. “Tell the voters .... What did you know, when did you know it and how deeply were you involved?” Campa-Najjar, the son of a Palestinian immigrant father and Mexican-American mother, argued Wednesday that if he has to answer for a website he had nothing to do with, Butner should disavow websites attacking him for the actions of his grandfather. Campa-Najjar’s paternal grandfather, whom he never met, was a member of the Palestinian militant group that carried out the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre. Campa-Najjar condemned the murders in a February Haaretz article revealing the connection. His grandfather was killed by Israeli commandos in 1973.Campa-Najjar followed up Tuesday to note that the story about his grandfather came out shortly before the California Democratic Party convention in late February. Although Campa-Najjar ended up winning the state party’s endorsement, he maintained that the timing raised the prospect that Butner planted the story.“Josh Butner has used the story to solicit donations,” Campa-Najjar wrote to supporters in an email blast Tuesday. “We call on him to condemn the story, and go on the record denying his campaign’s involvement in planting the story.”Butner’s campaign declined to address the provenance of the story about Campa-Najjar. Nguyen called the question a “desperate attempt by Ammar Campa-Najjar to pivot from the fact that his campaign has been linked to a website that maligns a former Navy SEAL and his family.”“Only Ammar Campa-Najjar can respond to the facts that Ammar’s grandfather was the mastermind of one of the worst terrorist attacks since World War II — a story that was reported by reputable news outlets in the United States and abroad,” Nguyen added.The Butner campaign informed GoDaddy, the domain host of DuncanButner.com, that Duncan Butner for Congress is not a real electoral committee and that the site may be a violation of Federal Election Committee rules. The campaign is considering filing an FEC complaint.The Hunter campaign did not immediately respond to a request for a reaction to the site.The controversial anti-Butner website ― and the outrage it has elicited among Butner’s supporters ― reflects the high stakes of California’s unusual nonpartisan “jungle” primary system. Since the top two vote-getters in the primary proceed to the general election regardless of party, Democrats are not guaranteed a spot on the general election ballot. In districts where there are multiple Democratic contenders, party leaders have publicly fretted about the risk of splitting the center-left vote and stymieing the chances of a Democratic takeover. An official of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which helps elect Democrats to the House, warned in March that the party has not ruled out intervening in California primaries to ensure that a viable Democrat ends up on the general election ballot.Previous attempts by the DCCC to affect the outcome in Democratic primaries have elicited the ire of the party’s progressive base, since the party typically sides with more moderate contenders. The DCCC’s decision to post opposition research against Laura Moser, a progressive running in Texas’ 7th Congressional District, proved especially controversial. Critics denounced the move as misleading and heavy-handed. And rather than sink Moser’s bid, it prompted an uptick in fundraising that helped propel her to a runoff with Lizzie Fletcher, a more pro-business contender.Campa-Najjar occupies a similar position vis-à-vis Butner. For example, he supports far-reaching progressive policies, such as “Medicare for all,” and wants to lower the eligibility age to 50 as an interim step. Butner, by contrast, is focusing more narrowly on fixing the Affordable Care Act, though he supports empowering Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices.Campa-Najjar’s more ambitious stances have won him the backing of national progressive groups, including Justice Democrats and the Working Families Party; the California Democratic Party; and a host of area labor unions and progressive groups.For Butner’s part, in addition to the support of Moulton and Democratic groups dedicated to electing veterans or national service alumni, Butner has attracted the support of California Democratic Reps. Scott Peters, Mark Takano and Pete Aguilar.Campa-Najjar bested both Butner and Hunter in fundraising as of the end of 2017 with a haul of over $500,000. Another Democrat, real estate agent Patrick Malloy, raised less than $400.The 50th Congressional District is comprised of northern and eastern suburbs of San Diego. Unlike several GOP-held California House seats where a majority of voters opted for Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump won the 50th by a margin of 15 percentage points.The DCCC has nonetheless targeted the district for a takeover, including it in its list of 70 GOP-held districts it calls “majority makers.”The party is likely buoyed by Rep. Hunter’s ethics challenges. Hunter is under federal criminal investigation for allegedly misusing tens of thousands of dollars in campaign funds for personal use.California’s nonpartisan primaries are scheduled for June 5.This article has been updated with statements Tuesday from the Butner and Campa-Najjar campaigns."

In the lead-up to the vote, critics warned that such a majority would give Orbán free rein to impose restrictive laws against NGOs and undermine Hungary’s democratic institutions.Hungarians turned out in large numbers across the country to vote on Sunday, bringing to close an election campaign filled with anti-migrant rhetoric and nationalist fervor. The vote has drawn international attention not only for its spiteful campaign rhetoric and the implications for the country, but because opponents fear Orbán’s rule threatens to create immense rifts in the European Union and provides a model of illiberalism that could spread to other states.At polling stations in the more liberal capital of Budapest, long lines of voters gathered throughout the day to cast their ballots, while some expressed their disdain at the government’s overwhelmingly negative campaign. “They don’t promise anything, they don’t have a program, they cannot give us anything. All they can give us is fear,” said Eszter Imrényi, a 25-year-old student.Orbán and his Fidesz government made migration the central focus of the campaign, plastering ads around the country showing a crowd of migrants with a large red “stop” sign overlayed on top. In speeches, Orbán railed against “foreign interests” that wanted to bring massive numbers of migrants into the country and ruin Hungary’s ethnic homogeneity.The Fidesz campaign also focused its vitriol on 86-year-old Hungarian-American George Soros, with Orbán constantly accusing the Jewish billionaire of trying to overthrow the government by employing thousands of agents to do his bidding. Critics and Jewish groups condemned the anti-Soros campaign for promoting age-old anti-Semitic stereotypes.“I have a sister, she’s turning 7 this summer, she’s in kindergarten,” Imrényi said. “She was asking me: ‘Soros ... what kind of witch is he?’”“How come my sister even knows this guy’s name? It’s terrible.” Opposing Orbán’s rule was a field of parties that range from a largely fractured group of left-liberal parties to Jobbik, a party with a far-right history that in recent years has tried to moderate its messaging and disavow the anti-Semitic, anti-Roma actions of its past. Although liberal parties attempted to increase their cooperation in the lead-up to the vote, neither the left nor Jobbik was able beat Fidesz.The election initially looked more competitive than expected, however, which observers say helped fuel the toxic atmosphere.“I’m really happy it’s over and we can vote,” Máté Linka, a 27-year-old lawyer, said earlier on Sunday. “It was a really disgusting campaign.”After seeing friends and family members leave the country in recent years to find opportunities elsewhere in the EU, Linka and other young voters who spoke with HuffPost hoped that a shift in government could offer solutions.But aided by what critics say is a stranglehold on the country’s media and an electoral system engineered to benefit his party, Orbán ensured that he will remain in power.This is Hungary’s second general election since Orbán’s government changed the election law to switch from two rounds of voting to just one, making it more difficult for voters who oppose Fidesz to rally around a single opposition candidate. Orbán relies on strong support in rural areas and on the votes of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Hungarians living in neighboring countries, whom he granted voting rights following his election win in 2010.“This was the first government that gave us the same rights as the natives,” said Orsolya Laura Peterfy, a 35-year-old English teacher who was born in Romania. “This government helped us with money and support.”Even among voters who oppose Orbán, few believed this was a vote he could lose. Instead, they hoped that this vote would limit his power and send a message that many in the country don’t support his rule.“This election is not about to win over Fidesz, because we don’t have a chance,” said Gabor Bone, a 45-year-old chef lining up to vote on Sunday afternoon.“It’s just to make sure in four years time we have the chance to vote again, and that time we’re gonna win.”Now set to enter his third consecutive term in power and likely armed with a powerful majority, however, Orbán appears more emboldened than ever."

Rounds said much of the criticism of the EPA chief is “nitpicking.”“I don’t know how much of it is overblown and how much of it is accurate, to be honest,” Rounds said.” “I’m not going to call it fake news.

ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox aired a combined 260 minutes of climate change coverage last year, according to a February study released by liberal watchdog Media Matters for America. Of that, 205 minutes, or 79 percent, featured actions or statements by the Trump administration, most often President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord. Nearly all coverage of climate change on Sunday shows ― 94 of 95 minutes ― focused on the administration.“It’s a travesty, frankly,” Michael Mann, a climatologist at Penn State University, told HuffPost of the lack of television coverage.“The Sunday shows have consistently under-covered climate change and other environmental issues,” Lisa Hymas, director of Media Matters’ climate and energy program, told HuffPost by phone. “When they do cover them, they rarely include experts. They bring on political people, and that means this all gets discussed in a really superficial, political light.”Of the 31 guests appeared on the lineups to talk about climate change, only 9 were women, and just 4 were nonwhite, according to a follow-up Media Matters study. None were scientists or journalists who specialize in climate or environmental reporting. Television has a long history of providing some of the worst coverage of climate change. Cable networks are more likely than newspapers and magazines to give as much time to industry-funded climate change denialists as they give to the 97 percent of peer-reviewed climate researchers who say rising global temperatures are caused primarily by fossil fuel emissions, according to John Cook, a research assistant professor at George Mason University’s Center for Climate Change Communication. “It gets even worse when you look at partisan cable TV,” Cook told HuffPost by email. “Outlets like Fox News are heavily slanted towards climate science denial and are a strong source of misinformation about climate change.” Pruitt appeared on Fox News 16 times during his first year in office, more than twice as often as all other major TV networks combined. The administrator, whose 14-month tenure has been marked by an all-out assault on fossil fuel regulations and scientific research, retreated to right-wing media outlets over the past week. Criticism over a series of ethics scandals, including a sweetheart deal to rent a room in a condo owned by an energy lobbyist’s wife for just $50 a night, has ballooned. As new reports detailing the arrangement emerged, Pruitt defended himself in interviews with The Washington Examiner, a conservative newspaper, and The Daily Signal, a news site run by the right-wing Heritage Foundation.Inviting guests with expertise in climate policy could provide a critical counterbalance to the media tit-for-tat over the details of Pruitt’s latest scandals, Hymas said.“If the shows had knowledgeable journalists on they could talk not only about the splashy ethics scandals ― the sweetheart condo deal, the luxury travel ― but also about the scandals surrounding Pruitt doing favors for industry people,” she said. “It’s a much bigger story.”"

On Friday, Handler joked that Attorney General Jeff Sessions preferred to be on the receiving end of gay sex. The tweet had drawn over 4,000 replies as of Sunday afternoon, with many arguing that Handler had missed the mark with her joke. Handler, who incensed members of the LGBTQ community earlier this year with a gay sex-referencing tweet aimed at Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), responded to the outcry later on Friday.Retweeting one critic of her original tweet, she quipped that she, too, was “proud” to identify as a “bottom.” Kimmel, meanwhile, also came under fire from many LGBTQ rights advocates Friday when he used similar allusions to gay sex in tweets directed at Fox News host Sean Hannity. The two media personalities had been involved in a war of words for much of the previous week, after Hannity blasted Kimmel as an “assclown” and a “despicable disgrace” for mocking first lady Melania Trump’s accent in a segment that aired Wednesday. But, once again, many weren’t laughing at Kimmel’s retorts. Both Handler and Kimmel have expressed support for LGBTQ causes throughout their careers, which is perhaps the biggest reason their bottom-referencing jokes have landed with such a thud. Acknowledging that many straight comedians opted to “employ bottom-shaming jokes to show that they ‘get’ gay culture,” The Daily Beast’s Ira Madison III nonetheless said Handler and Kimmel should re-examine the tone of their language if they wanted to be truly seen as queer rights supporters. “If they actually cared about gay people,” Madison wrote, “they wouldn’t resort to clichéd jokes that imply being on the receiving end during anal sex is somehow a shameful, cringeworthy act.” UPDATE April 8: Kimmel responded to the controversy in a lengthy note posted on Twitter.

Tax cuts had left the schools in such dire shape that Bridges ― the son of two teachers, husband to another and father to two more ― had trouble attracting talent. He found there was just one state from which he could reliably recruit educators, thanks to its rock-bottom teacher pay: his native Oklahoma.Bridges returned to Oklahoma last year to become superintendent of Jay Public Schools in Delaware County. More than 40 percent of residents there are Native American, and nearly 4 out of 5 students qualify for free or reduced-price lunches. The job brought him closer to his grandchildren, but Bridges quickly second-guessed the move. What he saw in Oklahoma was even worse than what he’d seen in Kansas. The elementary school was dirty and dilapidated. Many of the textbooks were 15 years old. First through third grades lacked a contemporary reading series, and the classrooms didn’t have whiteboards for the teachers to write on. Bridges had to cut a slow-pitch softball program to free up a few thousand dollars for such basic necessities.“It was appalling,” said Bridges, 59. “The conditions of the facilities were almost disgusting.”Oklahoma teachers are now in the midst of a walkout over school funding that is likely to spill into its second week. The shutdown follows a historic one just weeks ago in West Virginia, where a nine-day teacher strike led to a 5 percent pay raise for teachers and state workers. Kentucky educators have held their own walkouts this month and flooded the state Capitol to protest proposed cuts to pension plans and education budgets. Teachers in Arizona say they, too, will go on strike and close schools if the state doesn’t grant significant raises and restore public school funding to 2008 levels.There’s a short explanation for why these low-tax, GOP-controlled states are now facing rebellion: They have slashed public school funding significantly since the Great Recession, while also pursuing many tax cuts that have benefited businesses and the wealthy. The budget shortfalls that austerity has created have left no money to pump into schools or salaries, leading to teacher shortages, overcrowded classrooms and even four-day school weeks in Oklahoma. Teachers forced to take on second or third jobs have finally decided they’ve had enough.But the longer explanation stretches back a full generation, to when teachers in West Virginia, Oklahoma and Kentucky last walked off the job. Kentucky teachers shut down half the districts in the state in 1988 to demand more school funding. Teachers in West Virginia and Oklahoma both went on strike in 1990 for the same purpose. These were seminal revolts that today’s striking teachers still remember, either as students or young educators early in their careers. The work stoppages led to meaningful raises and investment at the time. But the promise they held eventually lost out to the anti-tax ideology of both legislators and voters. When Tish McDonald graduated from college in 1990, it was a time of great optimism in Oklahoma education. She started her career in public schools buoyed by the landmark legislation just passed in the statehouse to quell the walkout. What was known as House Bill 1017 dramatically reduced class sizes and set minimum teacher salaries, while also pouring money into early childhood programs and statewide testing. It did so by raising taxes, over the fierce objection of businesses.“It’s how we got our jobs,” recalled McDonald, a counselor in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. “Everyone was so excited. It was like a new day.” The decline that followed was so gradual that it was hard to see at first. Just two years after House Bill 1017 was enacted, voters approved a momentous ballot initiative known as state question 640. It required a supermajority of 75 percent in both chambers of the legislature for lawmakers to raise taxes again, making future hikes extraordinarily difficult. Meanwhile, many felt the full promise of the education overhaul never came to fruition.“They said if there’s a time where there’s a crisis, we can increase class sizes,” explained John Croisant, a sixth-grade geography teacher and girls soccer coach in Tulsa, Oklahoma. “The penalties for going over weren’t enough to warrant hiring new teachers. The schools basically just had to stop following the rules, and that was 10 or 15 years ago.”Kentucky followed a remarkably similar path. Two years after the 1988 protests, the state Supreme Court ruled that Kentucky’s education system had unconstitutionally failed to uphold its duty to provide adequate and equitable schools. The state legislature responded by passing a sweeping 1990 education reform law that raised taxes to better fund its public education system. In all, the changes generated $1.3 billion in new revenue between 1990 and 1992.Most of it went to Kentucky’s public school system: Teachers received a 15 percent raise over the next two years, former Kentucky Education Association director David Allen said, and in the ensuing decade, the funding gap between the state’s wealthiest and poorest districts began to shrink. The Kentucky Education Reform Act drew national attention both for its increased funding and the academic programs it implemented in an effort to improve the school system. But over the past decade, those funding increases have been slowly and steadily eroded due to round after round of spending and tax cuts. Since 2008, revenue shortfalls and a woefully underfunded pension system have combined to cause 20 separate rounds of budget cuts in Kentucky. In inflation-adjusted terms, Kentucky’s K-12 education budget is down 16 percent since 2008, according to the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy. Its higher education budget is down 35 percent. Because school districts are increasingly relying on local funding to make up for losses from the state, the funding gaps between rich and poor counties have returned and are once again growing.Teachers are increasingly forced to pay for their own school supplies. In some districts, educators said that schools have provided set amounts of paper at the beginning of the year and warned teachers not to run out. In most districts, there’s rarely money for new textbooks or educational materials.“I’m using the same resources that came out in the 1970s,” said Andrew Bailey, who teaches business at Fairdale High School in Louisville, Kentucky, and is now running for a seat in the state Senate. “I haven’t had a new textbook in my classroom since 2008.”Cutting taxes has proved much easier for legislators than raising them. Oklahoma lawmakers passed a series of bills starting in 2004 that reduced the state’s top income tax rate, while increasing the standard deduction and exempting capital gains from Oklahoma property sales. The state also cut the effective rate of its gross production tax on oil and gas firms, an extremely powerful lobby in Oklahoma. Meanwhile, Kentucky has handed out corporate tax breaks and created new loopholes ― for horses, for film production, for coal and alcoholic beverages ― that amount to $13 billion in annual giveaways. It was the same philosophy that led to huge budget gaps in states like Kansas: Cut taxes and reduce government, and the economy will prosper. Instead, the states are dealing with huge budget gaps. “In Oklahoma, we thought cutting both personal income tax and corporate taxes would bring prosperity,” said Croisant, who previously ran for an Oklahoma House seat as a Republican but recently switched his party affiliation to Democrat over the school funding issue. “We have sacrificed our schools and our kids’ futures on economic policies that do not work.” The states are now facing the reality that they need to raise taxes to adequately fund their schools, though some of the solutions they’re looking at are regressive ones.On Monday, Kentucky Republicans passed sweeping reforms to the state tax code that they said would generate hundreds of millions of dollars in new revenues. They used the money to help avoid the most drastic of Gov. Matt Bevin’s (R) proposed education budget cuts. But the plan reduces income taxes for the top 5 percent of Kentucky taxpayers, while relying heavily on cigarette tax increases and new sales taxes on various goods and services. Taxes will increase for everyone else, according to an analysis from the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy. The modest education funding that was preserved in the state budget is coming first and foremost out of the pockets of poor and middle-class Kentuckians, many of whom are teachers. The Kentucky GOP’s budget still zeros out funding for new textbooks, cuts funds for preschool and afterschool programs, and leaves K-12 education with less money on a per-pupil, inflation-adjusted basis than it received in 2008.Late last week, Oklahoma lawmakers passed two revenue-raising measures for education ― one that would require Amazon’s third-party vendors to collect sales tax and another that would expand gambling in tribal casinos. Earlier, lawmakers approved a tax on hotel and motel stays but quickly voted to repeal it. The state’s teachers union says either the governor must veto that repeal or the legislature must reinstitute the tax.So far the teachers have not wavered on their demands, and most of the state’s superintendents, including Bridges, have stood behind them. His district has burned through its remaining snow days and will remain closed as long as necessary to boost school funding, he said. But he worries that even if Oklahoma can patch together enough taxes to reopen schools, they will find themselves in the same position in a few years, with funding that lags behind other states and a deep-seated aversion to any new taxes. “The funding mechanism is broken,” Bridges said. “They’re going to put money in the top of the bucket, but they’re not plugging the hole.”"

Since 2008, revenue shortfalls and a woefully underfunded pension system have combined to cause 20 separate rounds of budget cuts in Kentucky. In inflation-adjusted terms, Kentucky’s K-12 education budget is down 16 percent since 2008, according to the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy. Its higher education budget is down 35 percent. Because school districts are increasingly relying on local funding to make up for losses from the state, the funding gaps between rich and poor counties have returned and are once again growing.Teachers are increasingly forced to pay for their own school supplies. In some districts, educators said that schools have provided set amounts of paper at the beginning of the year and warned teachers not to run out. In most districts, there’s rarely money for new textbooks or educational materials.“I’m using the same resources that came out in the 1970s,” said Andrew Bailey, who teaches business at Fairdale High School in Louisville, Kentucky, and is now running for a seat in the state Senate. “I haven’t had a new textbook in my classroom since 2008.”Cutting taxes has proved much easier for legislators than raising them. Oklahoma lawmakers passed a series of bills starting in 2004 that reduced the state’s top income tax rate, while increasing the standard deduction and exempting capital gains from Oklahoma property sales. The state also cut the effective rate of its gross production tax on oil and gas firms, an extremely powerful lobby in Oklahoma. Meanwhile, Kentucky has handed out corporate tax breaks and created new loopholes ― for horses, for film production, for coal and alcoholic beverages ― that amount to $13 billion in annual giveaways. It was the same philosophy that led to huge budget gaps in states like Kansas: Cut taxes and reduce government, and the economy will prosper. Instead, the states are dealing with huge budget gaps. “In Oklahoma, we thought cutting both personal income tax and corporate taxes would bring prosperity,” said Croisant, who previously ran for an Oklahoma House seat as a Republican but recently switched his party affiliation to Democrat over the school funding issue. “We have sacrificed our schools and our kids’ futures on economic policies that do not work.” The states are now facing the reality that they need to raise taxes to adequately fund their schools, though some of the solutions they’re looking at are regressive ones.On Monday, Kentucky Republicans passed sweeping reforms to the state tax code that they said would generate hundreds of millions of dollars in new revenues. They used the money to help avoid the most drastic of Gov. Matt Bevin’s (R) proposed education budget cuts. But the plan reduces income taxes for the top 5 percent of Kentucky taxpayers, while relying heavily on cigarette tax increases and new sales taxes on various goods and services. Taxes will increase for everyone else, according to an analysis from the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy. The modest education funding that was preserved in the state budget is coming first and foremost out of the pockets of poor and middle-class Kentuckians, many of whom are teachers. The Kentucky GOP’s budget still zeros out funding for new textbooks, cuts funds for preschool and afterschool programs, and leaves K-12 education with less money on a per-pupil, inflation-adjusted basis than it received in 2008.Late last week, Oklahoma lawmakers passed two revenue-raising measures for education ― one that would require Amazon’s third-party vendors to collect sales tax and another that would expand gambling in tribal casinos. Earlier, lawmakers approved a tax on hotel and motel stays but quickly voted to repeal it. The state’s teachers union says either the governor must veto that repeal or the legislature must reinstitute the tax.So far the teachers have not wavered on their demands, and most of the state’s superintendents, including Bridges, have stood behind them. His district has burned through its remaining snow days and will remain closed as long as necessary to boost school funding, he said. But he worries that even if Oklahoma can patch together enough taxes to reopen schools, they will find themselves in the same position in a few years, with funding that lags behind other states and a deep-seated aversion to any new taxes. “The funding mechanism is broken,” Bridges said. “They’re going to put money in the top of the bucket, but they’re not plugging the hole.”"

But it is unclear who sent them. Despite a law that requires clear labeling of campaign material, there was no information about who printed or distributed the leaflets. “This is clearly a political campaign propaganda tool,” said Marta Pardavi, co-chair of the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, a human rights group. Pardavi says the leaflets echo the government’s anti-migrant messages and warnings of terrorists waiting at the gates to get in. “It’s ridiculous in a way,” Pardavi added. “Unless you’ve already been fooled into thinking that this is real; that there are migrant hordes invading Hungary.”Muslims comprise only 0.4 percent of Hungary’s population. But Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and his Fidesz party routinely warn of “Muslim invaders” that threaten the country.“The language used is like there’s some kind of war going on in Hungary,” said Pardavi.Orbán’s leadership can seem like a far-right fever dream in which identity politics and fear of outsiders trumps everything else. Not only Muslims are targeted. Orbán’s chief of staff recently pounced on the country’s Roma minority, saying “we have been living with the Gypsies for 600 years, and to this day, we still haven’t been able to integrate them.” And at a campaign rally last month, Orbán warned against an “international” enemy that “speculates with money” in what critics read as an anti-Semitic attack. Last year, the government also began a billboard campaign that targeted the 86-year-old American billionaire George Soros, whose Open Society Foundations fund a range of liberal-minded projects and organizations in Eastern Europe. Soros, a Hungarian Jew, emigrated to the United States after World War II. A leading Jewish organization in Hungary asked Orbán to halt the campaign, saying it was a proxy for anti-Semitism ― something that the government denies.In an interview with HuffPost in Budapest, the government’s spokesman, Zoltán Kovács, said that the charge of anti-Semitism “is always the last resort of the liberal field.” He added: “We don’t care about Mr. Soros’ descent. We care about what his designs are.”Kovács, like Orbán, studied at Oxford University on a scholarship paid for by Soros, and Kovács spent years pursuing a Ph.D. at the same Soros-funded Central European University that the government now opposes. But the two men clearly harbor no warm feelings toward their former benefactor. During a radio program last month, Orbán described Soros-funded organizations as the biggest enemies of Hungary and followed up last week by claiming that the billionaire has 2,000 agents working to overthrow the Hungarian government and install pro-migration politicians. Soros, meanwhile, has rebutted Orbán’s personal attacks and denounced his crackdown on nongovernmental organizations in Hungary, calling the prime minister “the leader of a mafia state.”Orbán has also long provoked fellow members of the European Union with anti-Muslim speeches and anti-immigration policies, which included resisting an EU-mandated refugee quota and spending millions on a border fence.In so doing, he’s become an idol for far-right figures such as France’s Marine Le Pen and former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, who called Orbán a “hero” and recently visited Hungary. Across Europe and the United States, nationalists and populists in the far right now look to Orbán for lessons on how to win elections and stay in power.Poland’s nationalist government has followed Hungary’s example and challenged EU rules and norms on migration, while also imitating Orbán’s threats to the rule of law.“It’s not only a Hungary issue or a concern to Hungarian civil society, but far more important because of its export value,” Pardavi says. “What is going to stop this from spreading like a contagious disease to other states?”Under the guise of legal reform, Orbán has undermined Hungary’s judiciary and captured all independent state institutions, said Kim-Lane Scheppele, a professor of political science at Princeton University who previously worked at Hungary’s constitutional court. He “packed them with his own people and set them loose on making sure the opposition was as small as possible and as harmless as possible,” Scheppele said.Orbán also installed loyalists at state-run television and radio while his associates bought up several private media outlets. On Saturday, a major pro-Orbán news site ran an article touting alt-right figure Lauren Southern’s support of the prime minister, and earlier this week it posted an altered “The Lord of the Rings” clip depicting Orbán charging his cavalry against Soros’ orc army. Today, Orbán and his allies control much of how Hungarians get their news. When dealing with dissenting voices, Orbán and his spokesman have also aggressively gone after the media at home and abroad. Kovács writes an official government blog that consistently criticizes negative coverage of the government, railing against reporters and outlets such as The New York Times for pushing a narrative he believes is masterminded by Orbán’s political opponents and Soros.Orbán has also gone after human rights groups, including Amnesty International and the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, targeting them with what the government calls “Stop Soros” laws that would require NGOs that receive foreign funding above 25,000 euros to describe themselves as “foreign entities,” pay heavy taxes on donations and face harsh penalties for noncompliance.Most observers believe that Orbán will win a fourth term in office, in part because the opposition is fractured between leftist and liberal opposition parties and the far-right Jobbik party ― which has tried in recent years to rebrand itself as more moderate than Fidesz. But the election has been harder-fought than observers expected, and the uncertainty has seemingly intensified the vicious campaign.On the streets of Budapest, there may not be many actual refugees or migrants. But their images are everywhere. Orbán’s government has plastered posters all around the city showing a line of migrants at a border, with a big red “stop” sign overlayed on top ― the same photo that drew widespread condemnation when anti-EU politician Nigel Farage used it during the United Kingdom’s 2016 Brexit campaign.With the recent escalation of rhetoric, democracy advocates are worried, especially following Orbán’s speech on March 15. The prime minister told a rally of thousands of supporters in Budapest that after the vote, the government would seek out its opponents and take “moral, political and legal revenge.”“One constant across his career is that he’s always been a politician who had very clear enemies,” said Zsolt Enyedi, a Hungarian political analyst and professor at CEU.“For him, politics is a fight, and it’s difficult to imagine him not doing that anymore ― it’s like a shark not swimming.”"

Germany’s Federal Ministry of the Interior previously said four were dead, including the driver. Police say 20 others were injured near the popular establishment in the city’s historic old town, with six in severe condition, The Associated Press reported. Authorities are not looking for other suspects, according to the BBC.Reul said the driver, whose name has not yet been released, is a German national. German media reported the driver had a history of mental health struggles.While the attack appears deliberate, police have not said whether it is terrorism-related as they continue investigating. “There is no indication whatsoever of an Islamist background at this point,” Reul said.German Chancellor Angela Merkel reacted to the incident on Twitter, writing that she would do “everything possible to investigate the act and to support the families of the victims,” per The New York Times.Located near the Dutch border, Muenster is a small city of around 300,000 dominated by a university of the same name. Its charming city center was rebuilt to resemble its former self after sustaining damage in World War II.The Muenster incident echoes the December 2016 terror attack in Berlin, in which a van plowed into a Christmas market, leaving 12 dead.This story has been updated with more details about the incident."

Persico said he hopes it helps survivors heal old wounds.,2018-04-07,"The Diocese of Erie, Pennsylvania, published the names of 51 people accused of actions ranging from providing pornography to minors to sexually assaulting children.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ac811c8200000d30ceb41d7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A Catholic diocese in Pennsylvania has released the names of 51 former employees and volunteers ― both priests and lay leaders ― who were credibly accused of sexual abuse or misconduct in cases that date as far back as 1944.The Roman Catholic Diocese of Erie, Pennsylvania, published the names of 34 clergy members accused of abuse on its website Friday. The diocese also decided to include the names of 17 accused lay members, a step that advocates say distinguishes this list from similar ones published by other Catholic dioceses around the country.The people on the Erie diocese’s list were accused of actions ranging from providing pornography to minors to sexually assaulting children. The allegations were corroborated by secular legal trials, canon law trials, self-admission, or threshold evidence, according to the diocese.Rev. Lawrence T. Persico, bishop of Erie, said that the diocese’s goal in publishing the list for the first time was to “protect children.”“It is not possible for us to monitor all the people on the list,” he said in a statement on Friday. “This is an important step in helping the public become aware of information that is important for the community’s well-being.”“Some are concerned that publicizing these names will open old wounds,” Persico added. “Very importantly, we are actually publishing the names in the hope of helping the victims/survivors move one step closer to healing those same wounds. It is important they know they are not alone.”The website lists the accused people’s names, cities of residence, and in some instances, whether they received any sort of punishment for the alleged crimes ― from being dismissed from the clergy to being sent to jail.The accused are all former employees or volunteers of either the diocese or one of its affiliated agencies. Twenty-one of the priests and two of the lay members on the list have died, The Associated Press reports.One of the deceased clergy members on the list is Bishop Alfred Watson, who served as a leader of the diocese until the early 1980s. The list claims Watson “failed to act to stop abuse which was credibly reported to him.” The Diocese of Erie is one of six Pennsylvania Catholic dioceses subpoenaed for an investigation by the Pennsylvania attorney general’s office in September 2016. The office is investigating whether Catholic officials failed to properly handle abuse allegations over the decades. A state grand jury is expected to release the investigation’s findings as early as May, according to PennLive. “We do not know when the grand jury report will be forthcoming, but I am sure it will be a sobering moment for all of us,” Persico said. Along with the publishing a list of those accused, the Erie diocese said it is streamlining how abuse allegations are handled and increasing the clearances employees or volunteers need to work with children. About 25 percent of American Catholic dioceses have published lists with the names of credibly accused priests, according to the survivors’ advocacy group BishopAccountability.org.Just this March, the Catholic Diocese of Buffalo released its own list of 42 suspected pedophile priests. Terry McKiernan, president of BishopAccountability.org, said adding lay members to the list is an unusual step. “There are various ways the dioceses reduce the number on their list, so increasing the number by including laypeople is a positive step and might be unique in these lists,” McKiernan told the AP."

The message was plain: Sell the paper before it’s too late.The Post has endured multiple rounds of layoffs since 2010, when Alden Global Capital purchased the paper’s parent company, Media News Group (now Digital First Media), and adopted what’s been described as a “strip-mining” approach to management. According to the editorial, Alden has slashed the Post’s staff by almost two-thirds — and that’s despite the paper’s reported profitability. As of next week, only about 70 staffers will remain.“Denver deserves a newspaper owner who supports its newsroom,” the board wrote. “If Alden isn’t willing to do good journalism here, it should sell the Post to owners who will.”Otherwise, the journalists warned, the paper — which has been in circulation since 1892 and boasts nine Pulitzer Prizes — will be “rotting bones” in a few years, leaving “a major city in an important political region … without a newspaper.”Other than the staff editorial, the Post published five other opinion articles on Friday related to its decline under Alden. In one, veteran journalist and former Post editor Gregory Moore urged government, business and community leaders to come together to find a solution to save the decimated paper.“The Post has been an integral part of progress in Colorado,” Moore wrote. “It helped the community heal after fires, floods and unspeakable gun violence. It explained how we were changing politically and demographically, and it exposed corruption and malfeasance. It has provided a window and a mirror to help us become a better community.”“Not everybody loves it, but everybody needs it — whether they know it or not,” he added.Many journalists and others reacted to the Post’s “open revolt” with words of awe and support. Los Angeles Times editor Mitchell Landsberg described the coverage as “remarkable.” “This is what brave looks like,” wrote Bloomberg View columnist Joe Nocera.Earlier on Friday, the Post was called out for a glaring mistake on the cover of its print edition’s Life & Culture section. In an article described as the “ultimate visitors guide” to Denver’s Coors Field,” the paper erroneously printed a large photograph of Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia instead.The paper was quick to admit to the mistake and published a tongue-in-cheek mea culpa. Still, the Post was harshly criticized by readers for the gaffe.Many observers defended the paper, however, pointing out how hard it is for a newsroom to do its job well when it doesn’t have the resources to even scrape by.Copy editors at the Post were among the first to be expunged from the paper. “The Post cannot do its job starved of resources the way it is now,” said Moore in his op-ed.In March, Alden admitted that it had taken hundreds of millions of dollars from its Digital First Media newspapers, including the Post, to finance the fund’s often-risky investments, including buying sovereign Greek debt and a failing pharmaceutical chain.“Alden Global Capital has for years treated one of the biggest media companies in the country like a big ATM,” wrote Lee Schafer, a columnist for The Minneapolis Star-Tribune, last month. “Someday, it will run out of money.”CORRECTION: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the Denver Post will have 100 staffers after the latest round of layoffs. The Post had 100 staffers and will be down to about 70 after the most recent layoffs."

Kindness welcome.”The ads will be placed in El Paso and Laredo, Texas, just as Donald Trump is preparing to call out the National Guard to police the border.“While people are fleeing to the U.S. to escape violence, overprivileged, callous, cheating louts like Donald Trump Jr. are flying overseas to gun down living, feeling beings just for fun,” PETA President Ingrid Newkirk said in a statement calling Trump’s eldest son a “bad hombre.”Trump and his brother Eric, both avid game hunters, were featured in a series of controversial photos posted online posing with animals they had killed in Africa in 2012, including an elephant, crocodile, kudu, civet cat, leopard and waterbuck.After the photos were posted, Donald Jr. told a critic in a tweet that he was proud to be “a hunter.”Donald Trump last year lifted an Obama administration ban on American hunters importing trophy tusks and other elephant body parts into the U.S., but he then reversed himself after a public outcry. But early last month, Trump again quietly lifted the ban in a memorandum.The president last year called elephant hunting a “horror show.”African elephants have been listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act since 1979. “Elephants aren’t meant to be trophies, they’re meant to roam free,” Tanya Sanerib, international legal director at the Center for Biological Diversity, told The Associated Press.

The job entails creating a searchable database that has the ability to track about 290,000 news sources, both foreign and domestic, according to the DHS’s statement of work.The contractor will help DHS monitor “traditional news sources as well as social media, identify any and all media coverage related to the Department of Homeland Security or a particular event,” the job description reads.“Services shall provide media comparison tools, design and rebranding tools, communication tools, and the ability to identify top media influencers.”The online platform should also be able to instantly translate media from 100 languages, including Chinese and Russian, into English. It should also be able to analyze the coverage’s “sentiment” and “momentum.” With President Donald Trump’s aggressive rhetoric against the mainstream news ― he once labeled journalists as the “enemy of the people” ― many in the media industry saw the database as yet another attack on the free press.When asked for comment on the purpose of the database, Homeland Security press secretary Tyler Houlton sent HuffPost a link to a tweet he published Friday afternoon.In his tweet, Houlton maintains that the database of journalists is “standard practice of monitoring current events” and suggests that those suspicious of its purpose are “tin foil hat wearing, black helicopter conspiracy theorists.”Houlton did not respond to HuffPost’s follow-up questions on whether a similar database had already existed within the Department of Homeland Security and what the agency intends to do with the information.While many people ― journalists and social media influencers especially ― were worried about Homeland Security monitoring them, others argued that press-tracking databases are commonplace in the world of public relations.PR agencies and communication firms often keep their own databases of journalists and various media outlets, with notes for each. PR professionals also often use programs that track how their clients are being discussed in the media.For example, communication firms and public relation agencies use similar databases to find contact information for media outlets and journalists. Public relations professionals also use different programs that monitor news stories and how their clients are being discussed in the media.And Homeland Security isn’t the only federal agency to monitor the media, according to CNN military and diplomatic analyst John Kirby.“Given this administration’s denigration of most media outlets, I understand why the timing of this bid might look suspicious,” Kirby told CNN Politics. “But from what I can tell, this is nothing more than an attempt at media analysis.“It’s not at all different from what I have seen other agencies undertake to better understand the communication landscape. In fact, it would be PR malpractice not to put something like this together.”Susan Hennessy, a governance studies fellow at the Brookings Institution, also agreed that a database that tracks and monitors the media industry shouldn’t be of any concern.She discussed the issue on Twitter with Garrett Graff, the executive director of the Aspen Institute’s cybersecurity and technology program.Read a draft of the Department of Homeland Security’s job listing below."

PREVIOUSLY: Something amazing happened during one of Tony Robbins’ huge self-help lectures ― but it was not his doing. A woman identified as Nanine McCool stood up in the audience to call out Robbins’ take on the Me Too movement in San Jose, California, last month after he tried to characterize some of its proponents as people who don’t take responsibility for themselves. Robbins also bizarrely championed a man who chose not to hire a qualified female applicant because of her looks.As video of the event began circulating on social media, Tarana Burke ― who created the #MeToo hashtag ― chimed in herself. “I was made aware of this video BEFORE I ever saw it because Tony Robbins’ people reached out to do damage control within 24 hours,” Burke said over Twitter. “They wanted to ‘give me context’ apparently. I don’t need any. I have eyes. The full video is 11 mins. And it’s gross. Bravo to this woman.”Some on Twitter replied saying the full six-hour event cast Robbins’ comments in a different light, but Burke was still not convinced.“His misogyny runs deep,” she continued in her series of tweets, going on to explain exactly what the movement was all about ― not victimhood, but survivors. Robbins made a name for himself in the ’80s and ’90s by authoring a series of self-help books. He now tours the world giving lectures and has been featured on the Oprah Winfrey Network.McCool, handed a microphone, attempted to voice her concern over Robbins’ “mischaracterization” of the Me Too movement during the event while the life coach repeatedly drowned her out. “I’m not knocking the Me Too movement,” Robbins said, claiming that McCool’s explanation was simply her own “experience.”“I’m knocking victimhood,” Robbins said.“What you’re seeing is people making themselves significant by making somebody else wrong,” he continued, before invoking Jesus, stones and glass houses. Still, McCool calmly tried to tell Robbins that many of the movement’s proponents are advocating for safety at home and at work, to create environments that are free from sexual harassment and violence.“I think you do the whole movement a disservice,” she said. Robbins then tried using McCool to illustrate his argument, pushing his fist against her fist in a spectacle made more uncomfortable given the so-called guru’s towering 6-foot, 7-inch stature. “When you push someone else, it doesn’t make you more safe. It just makes them angry,” he said. (“It’s awareness. It’s not pushing,” a voice near the source of the video can be heard saying in response.)Robbins then shared a story about a “very famous man, very powerful man” who seemed to illegally decline to hire a woman because, even though she was the most qualified candidate, he considered her good looks a liability. Burke had something to say about that, too:HuffPost reached out to a representative for Robbins but did not receive an immediate response. See the moment below:"

The electricity is malfunctioning, the septic tank is rupturing, the insect repellant isn’t working…”“Hi! Rember me?” he wrote in another. “I’m the kid you ditched in the woods for a month!” That particular note concludes with, “Here’s a picture to remind you of me:” accompanying a sketch of someone jumping off a building.”In still another note, he mentioned that he “realized that my tent was full of morons.”Is it too much to hope for a summer camp-based musical in the future?"

Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), one of just two Democrats who voted for the nomination of now-embattled EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt last year, told HuffPost she plans to approve the former coal lobbyist, who rejects the science behind climate change. If confirmed, Wheeler would be next in line to take over the agency if Pruitt caves to mounting pressure to resign. “After meeting with Mr. Wheeler and reviewing his record, I’ve decided to support his nomination,” Heitkamp told HuffPost by email Friday evening. “I believe he’ll be open to working on issues important to North Dakota in a pragmatic and fair way, and I’ll hold him accountable to make sure he implements the mission of the EPA in a way that works for my state.”On Monday, a spokesman for Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), the other Democrat who had voted for Pruitt’s nomination, said he would also vote to confirm Wheeler. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), the only GOP senator to vote against Pruitt last year, did not respond to requests for comment.“Andrew Wheeler will bring extraordinary credentials to EPA that will greatly assist the agency as we work to implement the president’s agenda,” Liz Bowman, an EPA spokeswoman, told HuffPost. “We appreciate Senator Manchin and Senator Heitkamp’s support.” The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee voted 11-10 along party lines in February to advance Wheeler’s nomination. But the Senate has yet to schedule a vote. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) filed cloture on March 23, and a vote is expected by Monday night. The vote comes as Pruitt faces more calls to step aside over accusations of corruption and wasting taxpayer money. A flurry of scandals broke last week involving his spending, housing arrangement and imperious management of his agency. Environmental groups, hoping for Pruitt’s resignation, seized an opportunity to tank Wheeler’s nomination, effectively crippling leadership at an agency that has been the speartip of the Trump administration’s deregulatory agenda. The Sierra Club and the League of Conservation Voters called on their members last week to pressure senators to reject Wheeler’s nomination. They highlighted a February report from The Intercept that revealed Wheeler had hosted fundraisers for Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) and Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) five months before his formal nomination and two months before his first White House interview for the job. The groups hoped to draw parallels between the fundraisers and the firestorm over Pruitt’s sweetheart deal to rent a $50-a-night room in a luxury condo owned by the wife of a fossil fuel lobbyist with business before the EPA.Until mid-2017, Wheeler worked as a lobbyist for Murray Energy, the mining giant owned by coal magnate Bob Murray. Murray, a top Trump donor and bombastic political commentator, has wielded staggering influence at the White House. He provided the Trump administration with an “action plan” that called for a federal bailout of coal-fired plants, repeal of the Obama-era Clean Power Plan and a challenge to the 2009 EPA “endangerment finding” that determined carbon dioxide pollution poses a risk to public health.Democrats hammered Wheeler over his record of working for Murray at a confirmation hearing in November. But they largely glazed over Wheeler’s refusal to accept the overwhelming consensus among scientists that burning fossil fuels are the chief cause of climate change.“I believe that man has an impact on the climate, but what’s not completely understood is what the impact is,” Wheeler said at his confirmation hearing when confronted with the findings of the federal government’s latest climate report.Wheeler, who served as an Inhofe aide and counsel to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee in the mid-2000s, has also faced accusations of abusing his power to target political opponents. In 2005, Wheeler worked with Inhofe to demand tax documents from the Association of Local Air Pollution Control Officials and its sister group, State and Territorial Air Pollution Program Administrators, after the nonpartisan groups opposed a controversial greenhouse gas emission bill Inhofe supported. In February, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a government accountability and transparency watchdog, told HuffPost the 13-year-old tax probe “raises serious concerns as to Wheeler’s judgment.”Pruitt’s future at the agency remains uncertain. Trump has bucked White House Chief of Staff John Kelly’s pleas to fire Pruitt, tweeting praise for the administrator and saying he was “under siege” from reporters on Friday. But even if Pruitt remains, he reportedly has ambitions to run for governor or U.S. Senate in his home state of Oklahoma, or take over the Department of Justice if Trump fires Attorney General Jeff Sessions. (Trump denied reports that he was considering Pruitt for the top cop position.) That raises the chances that, at some point, Wheeler could take over the EPA. “Wheeler has his own record of corruption that must be investigated,” John Coequyt, Sierra Club’s senior director of federal policy, said in a statement. “Anyone who cares about protecting our communities, protecting taxpayers, and trying to maintain a transparent, accountable government will demand new hearings on Andrew Wheeler and demand the EPA start doing its job to protect the public once again.”This story has been updated with Sen. Joe Manchin’s decision to vote for Wheeler."

In all of the new ratings, Democrats are more likely to either flip a Republican seat or hold onto one controlled by Democrats. None of the changed ratings show Democrats taking a seat that Cook previously predicted would remain in Republican hands. Instead, they are changes regarding the likelihood that Republicans or Democrats will hold a seat.For example, the polling numbers cruncher changed its rating for Washington’s 5th Congressional District from “Likely Republican” to the more tenuous “Lean Republican.” It’s notable that Republicans’ hold on that district, which consists of a rural swath of Eastern Washington state, has slipped even modestly. Republicans undoubtedly do not want to have to spend money defending a seat represented by Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the fourth-highest-ranking Republican in the House. What’s more, Washington’s 5th is usually reliably Republican. President Donald Trump won in the district by 13 percentage points.Cook’s ratings changes are especially remarkable because they coincide with a modest increase in Trump’s approval rating. The percentage of Americans who approve of Trump’s performance ticked up from 38 percent at the beginning of January to 40 percent in April, according to FiveThirtyEight’s polling average.And while Democrats maintain a lead of more than 8 percentage points on the generic congressional ballot, it has fallen considerably since late December, when polling showed their edge reaching well into double digits.The trouble for Republicans is that those are still significant advantages for Democrats. A 40 percent approval rating is quite low for a sitting president less than a year and a half into his tenure.Add to the mix a historic number of Republican retirements ― 36 so far, according to Cook ― and much higher enthusiasm among Democratic voters, and it is easier to see why Cook continues to view Democrats as “slight favorites for House control.”Democrats need to flip 23 GOP-held seats to win back the majority. Accounting for the small number of Democrat-held seats where Republicans are competitive, the party must win 27 out of 55 contentious races, according to Cook."
73,ENTERTAINMENT,What If Joaquin Phoenix Is Friendlier Than He Gets Credit For?,Matthew Jacobs,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/joaquin-phoenix-you-were-never-really-here_us_5ac7c5aee4b0337ad1e7f1df,"The actor is known for being irritable. Maybe his new movie, ""You Were Never Really Here,"" has softened him.",2018-04-07,"Joaquin Phoenix and Jonah Hill in ""Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far on Foot.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ac7d10d1e000008087b0d02.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"Joaquin Phoenix has a reputation for being chilly, even cantankerous. The actor clearly doesn’t enjoy talking about himself, which means he might walk out of an interview or denounce the Hollywood publicity machine or maybe even refuse to speak much altogether. In 2014, during a half-hour Q&A after a screening of “Inherent Vice” at the New York Film Festival, Phoenix wore sunglasses and sat slumped in his seat onstage, not saying a word.When Phoenix called to chat about his new movie on Thursday, I expected the same terse energy he’s now famous for. What would it take to get this stoic oddball to laugh or say something nice, I wondered. As it turned out, it didn’t take much at all. Phoenix was jovial from the jump, even apologizing for our delayed start time. He needed to scarf down some lunch before we chatted, and who can begrudge a person that?Phoenix is starring in the new movie “You Were Never Really Here,” directed by Scottish mastermind Lynne Ramsay, whose visceral mood pieces (“We Need to Talk About Kevin,” “Morvern Callar,” “Ratcatcher”) have earned her a reputation as one of today’s sharpest filmmakers. Ramsay has found an ideal muse in Phoenix, who also gravitates toward raw character studies (“The Master,” “Her,” “We Own the Night”). Here, he plays a scruffy, taciturn, PTSD-stricken war veteran hired to rescue young girls from sex-trafficking rings and other gritty circumstances. Even for an actor who seems to give his entire body over to roles ― Commodus’ creepy lilt, Johnny Cash’s twitchy arrogance, Freddie Quell’s hunched gait ― “You Were Never Really Here” requires a nimble balance between dogged resolve and emotional vulnerability. You feel it in his movements.Maybe that’s why Phoenix was so chipper: After taking a couple of years off, he’s working with a director he adores and has three other promising projects on the horizon (“Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get Far on Foot,” “Mary Magdalene” and “The Sisters Brothers”). Phoenix and I discussed a smattering of topics, including why he doesn’t think you should call Robert De Niro “Bob,” that Joker movie he’s rumored for and maybe not knowing what Valentine’s Day is.It seems like you’re doing more press than usual for this movie. Does it feel that way to you, too?Ummm [laughs]. Let’s see. I have done some things that I haven’t done before, some TV stuff. Yeah, I think I have.Are you finding yourself warming to the press cycle more this time than you have with previous movies?[Pause] I don’t know. I don’t know what it is. I’ll tell you what it is. There were a couple of things. I went to Berlin with Gus Van Sant, actually, for [“Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get Far on Foot”]. I was with him when he did some interviews, and the way he talked about things seemed nice to me. I think part of it is just that I’ve found the opportunity to have conversations with people instead of doing, like, an interview. And I enjoy that. I guess maybe I like talking to other people about movies.We like hearing you talk about movies, so we want you to like the conversations that we subject you to. [Laughs]When other actors refer to you in interviews, they often call you Joaq. Do a lot of people call you Joaq?Ummm, I don’t know. How often do you say your friend’s name? You know what I mean? It’s not very often, is it?Right, I guess that’s true, but I think you have a general sense of what individual people call you, particularly when it’s something other than your given name. But maybe you don’t keep a mental catalog of Joaq versus Joaquin versus whatever else people might call you.Yeah, I think it’s probably even... yeah. But I don’t like it when people say Bob instead of Robert when they’re talking about De Niro. It drives me crazy. Don’t call him that. You know?So you call him Robert?Well, I don’t call him. But if I was referring to him, yes, I would say — I don’t know what I’d say. I’ve actually never thought of it.But what if Robert De Niro likes being called Bob?Yes, that’s right. That’s totally up to him. You’re absolutely right. What if I kind of sat him down and said, “Listen, man, I don’t think you should let people call you Bob. I don’t know whether you’re comfortable with this or not, but it makes me uncomfortable, so if you could please put an end to that.”You really should do that. Robert is a more sophisticated name than Bob. Who wants to be Bob? [Editor’s note: No offense to all the great Bobs out there.]But you’re right. Maybe he does.It feels like people who call you Joaq are the ones who really know you. The ones in the inner sanctum get to say Joaq, and the rest of us are just Joaquin.I mean, really, whatever. Whatever you want.Does anyone still call you Leaf? [Editor’s note: When Phoenix was a teen actor, he used Leaf as his first name because most of his siblings’ monikers were inspired by nature: River, Rain, Summer and Liberty.]No. No. That’s been a very long time.And if they did, you would promptly correct that, I assume.I mean, it just hasn’t been my name. You know that I was born Joaquin, right?Yes, I do know that.But, yeah, it hasn’t been my name, and it’s funny because I was talking to Gus recently about it. I remember when I did “To Die For,” because I’d always been credited as an actor as Leaf, and he was like, “So are you officially changing it?” It just hadn’t even occurred to me because this is my name — I was just reverting to my original name. But I remember that, for other people, it felt like there was a change. But it had been changed for me prior to that for so long.So you never had a latter-day moment where you thought, “Man, I should have kept Leaf as my professional name”?I haven’t thought that. Why, is that your suggestion?No, I like Joaquin. Leaf is a conversation starter, as in, “How did you and/or your parents arrive at the name Leaf?” But I do really like the name Joaquin. That’s a unique name ― not that Leaf isn’t also.Yeah. It’s not in Central America. Oh, that makes sense. I spoke to Lynne Ramsay earlier, and she said when you two first discussed the movie you could only understand 50 percent of what she was saying and weren’t quite sure what you were agreeing to.It’s very fun to think about it that way. But it is true that, when I first spoke to her on the phone, it was difficult to understand everything that she had said.Having just spoken to her on the phone, I can relate to that, yes. Yeah. So it was a bit of a struggle, but once you’re with her in person, then you get it.I assume you at least knew you would potentially get cast in this movie?Yeah, I read the script before I talked to her. I’m pretty sure that’s what happened, yeah.I know you haven’t seen the movie and don’t watch your own material. Even having lived and breathed this character, is it hard to do the press cycle because you don’t really know what the finished result looks like?I don’t know, sometimes we get into talking about certain details and I’ll explain the process for a particular take or scene, and the journalist will go, “What is that?” And I say, “The scene in the movie.” So there are times when I don’t know what take she used. Today we were talking about this scene that, for me, revealed a lot about the character and his relationship with [a hammer that’s essential to the story]. I didn’t know if that was the take that she used or if she used another take, and it turned out that it was that take. So I guess it makes sense in some ways that the take that felt the most meaningful to me, and the one that to me revealed the most about the character, was the one that’s used. But I didn’t really know.The way this character moves through the streets feels like a dance with the camera, almost like you’re finding your way in and out of cars and buildings in an improvisational style. The camera often sits in unconventional spots, and you’re figuring out the territory of the New York City streets you’re traveling.Yeah, that is a reflection of the experience. I don’t know that we ever really did any take the same way twice. We might have, and there might be some situations where it’s pretty clear that there’s no other choice but to cross the street here at this moment, but I think that our approach to each moment was to not make any concrete decisions about it in advance. We would talk about different options, different possibilities, but it wasn’t until we got into the space — we would make decisions in the moment, and sometimes there are things I’m reacting to in the moment. There are times when other actors didn’t know what was going to happen because we didn’t know what was going to happen in that moment. And I think I probably like that way of working in general, but I think it was probably really applicable to that character and this experience. Maybe that’s why it worked for us.Where are you right now? I hear screeching in the background. Oh, yeah, I’m sorry. I was just doing an interview at Chateau Marmont and there’s a pool and there are kids. Is it terribly distracting to you?No, no, no, it’s fine. I just wanted to make sure you were somewhere safe. I thought there might be cats howling.Thanks, I’m safe.Good. Are you aware of how much the internet loves the photo of Rooney Mara smoking a cigarette on the set of “Mary Magdalene” while you are nailed to the cross?I am not aware of that.Have you seen this photo?I believe that I have seen that photo a long time ago. I think [director Garth Davis] sent it to her. I think.It’s an amazing photo. I realize you were just in between shots on a scene, so the whole thing is probably very commonplace for you. But can you narrate the photo for me? The imagery of you as Jesus on the cross and her casually smoking a cigarette as Mary Magdalene in the middle of the day is great. Is it sacrilegious?In the best possible way, maybe.[Laughs] Um, well, I don’t know. Honestly I’m not entirely sure, but what I imagine is once I went up I stayed up. So I imagine that — I don’t know. Honestly I don’t know when that happened, so I couldn’t tell you.The distribution rights for that movie are tied up with The Weinstein Co., which filed for bankruptcy. Is that frustrating?Well, yeah, of course. I mean, yeah. I don’t know when it was going to come out. I don’t know if it would have been by now, anyways. I’m not entirely sure. I usually stay out of that stuff, like when a movie is going to be released and how. I usually don’t pay attention to it, and I thought that that was going to be worked out. We always knew it was going to be released in Europe before, so I don’t know when it’s coming out here.Tell them to hurry. I want to see it. I want to ask about something you said a year ago. I know you’re being asked in just about every interview whether you’re going to play the Joker, and I’m not going to ask that exact question, but I do want to point to something you told Bret Easton Ellis in The New York Times. You said, “Something that’s going to demand six months of my time? I don’t know.” Even beyond actually making the movie, you’d have a grueling press cycle to follow. Are you rethinking your willingness to make those sorts of long-term commitments? I don’t really know why I said that to him because I don’t really think about movies in terms of, like, the commitment of time. I think I was just trying to be funny or something. When you feel drawn to participate in a film, my feeling is no matter what, under any circumstances, wherever we’re shooting, whatever the hours are, whatever I have to do to be a part of this, I’m willing to do it. I don’t really make decisions on, like, what’s going to be the most comfortable. “What season is it going to be? Am I wearing comfortable clothing?” These are not the considerations, usually. I don’t know what that is. Recently I made a movie that took us four months and another one that was less than five weeks. And they both were fulfilling and difficult in their own way. But I think when you’re drawn to something, it doesn’t really matter the circumstances.Darren Aronofsky did want you to play Batman once.I’m sorry, what?Darren Aronofsky once wanted you to play Batman in an adaptation he described as “Travis Bickle meets ‘The French Connection,’” which actually sounds like an apt description of “You Were Never Really Here.” That was before the superhero craze that we’re inundated with now. Did you and Darren talk about that project?I feel like this is the first I’m ever hearing of this.Really? This was before the Christopher Nolan series. As he tells it, Aronofsky pitched Warner Bros. on an unconventional, less heroic Batman. He says he wanted you for the role, but I don’t know if the negotiations got far enough for you to actually join the discussions. The studio rejected the idea because it was too dark, of course.[Laughs] Yeah, I don’t know about this, but certainly there was no real discussion. And if he mentioned it to me one time, I think that I would have remembered. But I don’t remember that ever happening. It sounds interesting, though.Yeah, I’d love to see that version of Batman. Had that come to fruition in the late ’90s, and let’s say you still did “Gladiator” in 2000, those two movies together would have really elevated you to a certain celebrity status that you seem to have never been chasing. Well, thank God it didn’t happen that way then.Do you see “Gladiator” as a big turning point as far as your fame is concerned?I mean, certainly it was. It was the most successful movie that I’ve been in at the time, and maybe still is. [Editor’s note: “Signs” is his most successful movie.] And absolutely it changed my career, but also, as an actor, working with Ridley Scott, I learned a lot making that movie. It is an important film for me as an actor. That’s really all I know about. I understand that it was successful and people still talk about that movie, but really, as an actor, it had an impact on me.Did you and Mark Walhberg ever have actual conversations about what it would have been like for the two of you to star in “Brokeback Mountain”?No.Are you aware that you were attached to that role at some point, given you aren’t aware of the Batman thing?No, I wasn’t.The internet would beg to differ.Oh, really? No, I was never attached to that role, and I didn’t know that Mark was in consideration for it either. But I met on that movie — I met with Ang Lee, but I didn’t get the job.OK, gotcha, but you were out there somewhere in terms of the casting process.Oh, yeah, I don’t think there was an actor of my generation that was working that didn’t want to make that movie. I certainly wanted to be in that film, but it didn’t work out.So do you really not know what Valentine’s Day is? What does Rooney think of that?You’d have to ask her. But I think I was just trying to have some laughs with Will Ferrell. [Editor’s note: A representative for Rooney Mara did not respond to our request for comment.]Are you a Garry Marshall fan?Uhhhh. Oh! Sure. Yeah, Garry’s amazing. He made those movies, right?Yeah, “Valentine’s Day,” “New Year’s Eve,” “Mother’s Day.” Right, right, right. This feels like Teen Beat. It feels like it’s 1985 and we’re doing Teen Beat asking me about Valentine’s Day [laughs].Do you have fond memories of the Teen Beat interview days?I don’t think I was ever — I remember being aware of Teen Beat, but I don’t think I ever did any interviews for Teen Beat. But for some reason I remember C. Thomas Howell looking awesome in a hat or some shit.That’s amazing. I’ll wear that as a badge of honor.Yeah."

He was convicted of the crime and sentenced to a five-year jail term in 2006. A high court suspended his sentence a week later and eventually acquitted the actor of all charges.In 2016, however, the Rajasthan government appealed the acquittal. The case then languished in court again until March, when the most recent trial began.Khan, who has denied the poaching allegations, spent a night in Jodhpur Central Jail on Thursday, reported Inda’s NDTV. Khan’s attorney said the high court would be hearing the 52-year-old actor’s bail request on Friday morning.Khan would be appealing the decision, the attorney added, noting that the verdict had come as a “surprise.”Vikram Singh, a police officer at the Jodhpur jail, told NDTV that Khan had been provided with “four blankets” and would be sleeping on the floor during his time at the prison. Indian media outlets shared photographs of Khan being booked into the jail.Khan, described as one of Bollywood’s most notorious “bad boys,” is no stranger to legal troubles.In 2015, he was sentenced to five years in prison for killing a homeless man and injuring four other people in a hit-and-run accident in Mumbai. He was immediately granted bail and served no time behind bars before a high court threw out all charges a few months later, citing a lack of evidence. At the time, the acquittal raised questions about whether celebrities like Khan were being treated preferentially by the Indian justice system.Khan’s ex-girlfriend, Bollywood actress and former Miss World Aishwarya Rai, famously accused the actor of domestic abuse in the early 2000s. Her parents reportedly lodged a police complaint against the actor for harassing their daughter after the couple broke up. Khan has denied the allegations.Despite this indecorous record, however, Khan’s popularity and film career have only continued to blossom over the years. Forbes estimated that Khan made $37 million in 2017, making him the ninth-highest paid actor in the world and the second-highest paid actor in India (Bollywood’s Shah Rukh Khan was ranked eighth on the Forbes list). Observers have even suggested that Khan’s “bad boy” reputation has boosted fans’ adulation of him.“Khan’s bad boy image has sustained him from the beginning of his career,” Anna Vetticad, an Indian film industry journalist, told The Guardian this week. “The frequent reports of drunken misbehavior in public, indiscipline at work and girlfriend abuse, along with the hit-and-run and poaching cases that finally landed him in court, have contributed greatly to fan enthusiasm for him.”To his fans, Khan “is a golden-hearted man-child whose charitable trust is reason enough to forgive him for what they consider mere human failings,” she added.In a scathing commentary on Thursday, HuffPost India’s Bollywood editor Ankur Pathak suggested that Khan’s recent sentence would similarly have no negative effect on the actor’s career.“A conviction and a spell in prison are unlikely to make the slightest dent in Brand Salman,” Pathak wrote. “Tragically, the controversies that put Khan on the wrong side of the law have a seemingly opposite effect on the hundreds of thousands of [his] fans, who determinedly stand by the superstar despite his misdemeanors.”Indeed, as news of Khan’s recent sentencing made international headlines, the hashtags #WeLoveYouSalmanKhan and #IStandBySalman began trending on India’s social media platforms as fans called for the actor’s prompt release from prison.A bevy of Bollywood celebrities also expressed their support for the actor. Director Anil Sharma said he was “disturbed” by Khan’s sentencing and said he would be “praying” for his quick release. Actress Mawra Hocane said a “great human being” was being wrongly punished, while actor Anup Soni said Khan was “surely paying the price for being [a] celebrity.”"

But the site is also rife with misinformation and hate speech.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ac6edea1f00002d0016c77a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A group of civil society organizations in Myanmar blamed Facebook for the spread of misinformation that may have put thousands of Rohingya people in danger, saying the company is far from the paragon of moderation its CEO claims it to be.Earlier this week, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told Vox’s Ezra Klein that Facebook’s systems detected two chain letters that spread across the country last year as the military was forcibly and violently removing nearly 700,000 people from the country’s Rakhine State. One of the fake letters warned of an impending attack by Muslim groups and used a racial slur, another warned Muslims that Buddhists were planning violence themselves.“The Myanmar issues have, I think, gotten a lot of focus inside the company,” Zuckerberg said in the interview, part of a media blitz meant to counter growing outrage over the company’s use of user data. “I think it is clear that people were trying to use our tools in order to incite real harm. Now, in that case, our systems detect that that’s going on. We stop those messages from going through.” But in the letter sent this week, six groups said that Facebook took more than four days to address the spread of misinformation and that it detected the letters only after the groups alerted the company themselves.“In your interview, you refer to your detection ‘systems’. We believe your system, in this case, was us ― and we were far from systematic,” the groups wrote. By the time Facebook addressed the concerns, “thousands, if not hundreds of thousands,” had seen the messages, they said.“This is not quick enough and highlights inherent flaws in your ability to respond to emergencies,” the letter continues. “Your reporting tools, for one, do not provide options for users to flag content as priority. As far as we know, there are no Burmese speaking Facebook staff to whom Myanmar monitors can directly raise such cases.”The messages, the groups allege, led to at least three violent incidents. Last month, investigators from the United Nations said Facebook had played a “determining role” in the Rohingya crisis.A Facebook spokesperson said the company didn’t want the site “to be used to spread hatred and incite violence” and apologized for Zuckerberg’s characterization, saying the groups were indeed the first to report the issues.“We took their reports very seriously and immediately investigated ways to help prevent the spread of this content,” the spokesperson said in a statement. “We should have been faster and are working hard to improve our technology and tools to detect and prevent abusive, hateful or false content.”Facebook said it had added more Burmese-language reviewers to help handle reports in the country.In some developing countries, including Myanmar, Facebook can provide vital communication networks for many people, and many use the site as their only source of news, according to The New York Times. But the social network has also become rife with misinformation and hate speech, and Facebook does not have an office in the country.Facebook has been contending with an outpouring of frustration in recent weeks after the fallout over the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Facebook has been pummeled with questions over how it handles users’ private data, and Zuckerberg is slated to appear before Congress next week. Thursday’s letter adds to a growing tide that may force a reckoning at the company, and Zuckerberg himself has said he’d be open to the right kind of government regulation. But the groups who sent the letter said the way the company operates now is not enough and could very well lead to more danger in Myanmar.“The risk of Facebook content sparking open violence is arguably nowhere higher right now than in Myanmar,” the letter concludes. “If you are serious about making Facebook better, however, we urge you to invest more into moderation ... and ― perhaps most importantly ― we urge you to be more transparent about your processes, progress and the performance of your interventions, so as to enable us to work more effectively together.”Read the whole letter here.This article has been updated to include comment from a Facebook spokesperson."

He told the Austrian broadcaster ORF that his government’s goal is to “confront any development of parallel societies in Austria.” “Girls wearing a headscarf in kindergarten or primary school is of course part of that,” he said, according to Reuters.The proposed ban would reportedly affect girls under the age of 10.But the Islamic Religious Community in Austria, an umbrella group known as IGGO that represents Austria’s Muslim communities, said the proposal addressed a “marginal phenomenon.” The organization says most Muslim kindergarteners in the country do not wear headscarves.Many Muslim women only begin wearing religious headscarves, or hijabs, after they reach puberty.In the rare instances that elementary school children do don headscarves, the organization said that each case should be considered individually and with the desires of the young girl in mind.The organization called the government’s move toward an outright ban both “patronizing” and “absolutely counterproductive.” The group also pointed out that no one would think of banning children from wearing skullcaps or crosses in class. “What appears most problematic is that this is also about fundamental and human rights, such as the right to education and freedom of religion,” IGGO’s statement reads.

One trip to Morocco last year cost $40,000. Pruitt spent his time touting liquified natural gas exports to that nation. The only exporter of liquified natural gas from the continental U.S. is Cheniere Energy Inc. The company was a client of Hart’s lobbying company, Williams & Jenson, while Pruitt was renting the condo. Exxon Mobil is also a client.Steven Hart told ABC News that the condo was co-owned by his wife, Vicki Hart, with other unnamed partners. He said he believed the rent Pruitt paid — $50 a night a block away from the Capitol — was close to market rate. A copy of Pruitt’s lease was published Thursday by The Washington Post. “Steve” is clearly seen scratched out on the lease to be replaced by “Vicki” Hart. The EPA ethics office signed off on the condo deal, but a memo obtained by CNN and the Post, which included a copy of the lease, now says that not all the facts were known at the time.Pruitt’s lease claimed he used only one room of the condo when he was in town, but it’s difficult to imagine he had roommates. Several EPA sources told The Washington Post that Pruitt’s daughter stayed in a second bedroom of the condo while she was working in the White House.“Some have raised questions whether the actual use of the space was consistent with the terms of the lease,” the EPA lead ethics official, Kevin Minoli, wrote in his April 4 memo. The impartiality rule requires that government officials avoid doing things that could create an “appearance of favoritism in government decision-making,” according to the U.S. Office of Government Ethics.Ethical concerns about the condo are among several new issues dogging Pruitt. Two of Pruitt’s aides were recently granted raises (of 52 percent and 33 percent) despite the White House rejecting the increases. Pruitt told Fox News Wednesday that he was attempting to determine how that happened. But two unnamed EPA officials told the Post that Pruitt instructed aides to award the raises.Pruitt also attempted to inappropriately use his vehicle’s emergency sirens simply to cut through traffic. And The New York Times reported that five EPA officials who challenged Pruitt’s “unusually large spending” were either reassigned, demoted or forced out.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Wednesday that “we take this seriously and we’re looking into” the condo lease. But President Donald Trump on Thursday told reporters aboard Air Force One that Pruitt has been “very courageous . . . I can tell you at EPA he’s done a fantastic job.”If Pruitt steps down, he will serve the shortest term of any EPA chief in history."

They appear to be back on.",2018-04-06,Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is now saying that Florida's coastal waters are not exempt from the administration's offshore drilling plans.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ac7d7761e00008e0b7b0d0a.jpeg?cache=K8CkP2gh7u&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke on Friday walked back previous statements about the Trump administration’s offshore drilling plans, indicating Florida’s coastal waters are in fact still on the table.“No one was exempted,” he said, according to The Associated Press.The comment came at an offshore wind energy forum in Plainsboro, New Jersey, where Zinke spoke about American’s energy potential and the Trump administration’s all-of-the-above approach to powering America. In January, the Trump administration released a sweeping plan to boost America’s fossil fuel production that would open nearly all U.S. waters, including huge swaths of the Arctic, Atlantic and Pacific oceans, to oil exploration. Less than a week later, just two days into a 60-day public comment period, Zinke traveled to Florida, where he announced that, at the recommendation of Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R), he was withdrawing the state’s coastal waters from the areas that could be leased.“I support the governor’s position that Florida is unique and its coasts are heavily reliant on tourism as an economic driver,” Zinke said at the time.Zinke faced intense criticism over the decision, which many saw as arbitrary and political. Democratic governors, lawmakers and other officials demanded that their states be granted the same exemption. And Republicans from Atlantic coastal states, including some who support offshore drilling, said the decision to allow it in coastal waters ultimately should be made by local officials.Muddying the situation, Walter Cruickshank, director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, told lawmakers at a congressional hearing in mid-January that Zinke’s statement on Florida “stands on its own” and “is not a formal action.” But Zinke later defended his exemption, indicating it would stand.“The coastal currents are different, the layout of where the geology is,” he told CNN in late January. Adding to the confusion, The Associated Press reported that at Friday’s event Zinke “specifically noted that Florida has not been exempted.” During his public comments Friday, Zinke acknowledged that there has been “a lot of opposition” to new offshore drilling, in particular off the Pacific and Atlantic coasts.“Our plan takes into consideration the local communities, the voice of the governors,” he said."

If they don’t win, it’s a shame pretend you’re in someone else’s home...It’s baseball season in the Mile High City. To honor the occasion, the Denver Post produced what it called an “ultimate visitors guide” for fans attending the Colorado Rockies’ home opener Friday.The otherwise solid rundown of Coors Field’s amenities contained just one tiny error: The newspaper used a photo of Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia.It’s a great picture. So great that readers could easily see “Phillies” above the scoreboard in the team’s iconic swooping cursive. The absence of the Rocky Mountains behind the stadium was also a pretty clear tell.The Phillies were quick to call out the error: The Denver Post owned up to what it labeled a “production error” and tweeted an apology. It also published a good-natured mea culpa a few hours later, asking fans to submit photos of Coors Field for a chance to win tickets to a game.“With your help,” the paper joked, “we might finally know what Coors Field looks like.”Embarrassing as the error is, it’s easy to see how it might happen. The hedge fund that owns the paper, Alden Global Capital, has systematically whittled away at the staff. Although the Post has reportedly turned profits as high as $25 million in recent years, Alden Capital has taken a “strip-mining” approach to management, cutting dozens of journalists who would otherwise catch mistakes before sending the paper to print. The paper was forced to cut one-third of its remaining staff just last month. Copy editors were among the first casualties, and Alden has taken cash from the paper to help cover its losses elsewhere ― like on risky $100 million bets buying sovereign Greek debt."

While some places are shunning mining companies, others are embracing any blockchain-related new businesses. Steve Helber/AP",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ac7a4ba1e000031007b0cb3.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Bitcoin enthusiasts envision a world in which the entire economy runs on blockchain technology, allowing people to buy their homes, write their wills and even vote without the involvement of a third party.By Jen FifieldThings have been kind of crazy in Massena, New York, since the bitcoin miners came to town. So crazy that Steve O’Shaughnessy, the new town supervisor, says he hasn’t unpacked his office since he started his job in January.O’Shaughnessy says it’s a good thing, though. In the past decade, his town of about 13,000 on the St. Lawrence River has lost much of its main industry — as a powertrain plant closed and an aluminum manufacturing plant downsized. But now, one and possibly two bitcoin mining companies are moving in, and they have promised to create dozens of jobs.Across the United States, bitcoin miners — who set up computers to solve complex math programs and unlock new bitcoin — are rushing to small towns and wide-open states with cheap rent, land or electricity. Many places are shunning the bitcoin mining companies, saying they suck up too much electricity without producing jobs. But places such as Massena are putting out the welcome mat — not just for bitcoin miners, but for any and all “cryptocurrency” industries.The idea is to attract entrepreneurs who are developing new uses for blockchain technology, which records agreements and transactions on an open, online ledger. Bitcoin was the original blockchain technology, but enthusiasts envision a world in which the entire economy runs on the technology, allowing people to buy their homes, write their wills and even vote without the involvement of a third party.While bitcoin mining may not create many jobs, state officials and cryptocurrency advocates believe in the economic potential of the industries created through blockchain technology.To signal that they’re open for business, states — especially those with small or shrinking populations — are enacting laws that, for example, exempt certain cryptocurrency transactions from the licensing laws that apply to others who transmit money, like banks. At least six states — Kansas, Illinois, New Hampshire, Tennessee, Texas and Wyoming — have enacted laws or issued guidance in the past four years that exempt some digital currencies from money transmitter licenses.“There is a bit of a battle going on between states to be the next Silicon Valley for open blockchain networks,” said Peter Van Valkenburgh, research director at Coin Center, a nonprofit research and advocacy center based in Washington, D.C., that focuses on issues pertaining to cryptocurrency and related technology.Enthusiasts in small towns are advertising their cheap electricity, organizing meetups, and trying to get businesses to accept cryptocurrencies — even as the value of bitcoin has declined over the past four months, and despite warnings that the largely unregulated industry is vulnerable to fraudsters, hackers and money launderers.“We’re seeing a little mini-gold rush of blockchain companies right now,” said Wyoming state Rep. Tyler Lindholm, a Republican. “And I want them all.”Appearing ‘Crypto-Woke’Blockchain technology enables people to make agreements and transfer value without a centralized system. Each transaction is secured and recorded through cryptographic functions, or high-tech math, and verified through a network of users. By design, it is meant to regulate itself. Examples include bitcoin, but also applications that allow people to come to contractual agreements without involving banks, courts or lawyers.Despite the system’s built-in protections, agreements and transactions made with blockchain technology are still susceptible to fraud, hacking and theft. That’s why some states have enacted regulations. New York, for example, in 2015 created a regulatory system, BitLicense, in which anyone doing “virtual currency business activity” must first get a license from the state.Justin Wales, chairman of the blockchain technology and digital currency practice at Carlton Fields, a law firm, said New York’s law is flawed because it forces nearly everyone in the “tokenized economy” to follow the same financial rules as banks, even though there are many different types of tokens and transactions.On the other hand, Wales and Van Valkenburgh say, the cryptocurrency-friendly laws that some states are rushing to enact don’t always make sense, either.Regulators “want to do something just to be seen as doing something,” Wales said. This is a risky approach, he said, because poorly written laws could restrict the technology and stifle innovation.Wales cites laws enacted by Arizona, Nevada, Tennessee and Vermont in the past two years as examples. The laws clarify that contracts secured on the blockchain are legally binding. The problem, Wales said, is that most states already have laws that verify that digital signatures are legally binding. Enacting new laws that make this technology-specific could have unintended consequences, he said.“That’s an example of states wanting to appear ‘crypto-woke,’” Wales said.Defining CryptocurrencyVan Valkenburgh and Wales say states need to clarify when a license is needed to exchange tokens for dollars or tokens for other tokens.“It could be good to get rid of the ambiguities,” Van Valkenburgh said, “a positive signal to the industry.”Wyoming is trying to lead the way in defining the new market as it tries to diversify its economy with new technology innovation, said Lindholm. Wyoming lawmakers last month approved five cryptocurrency-friendly bills cosponsored by Lindholm, including one that makes it clear that the state distinguishes digital tokens from typical currencies and securities. Another exempts cryptocurrencies from state securities regulations.“I don’t think hard regulations ever produced something that changed the world,” Lindholm said. “That’s what we are looking for and what everyone is looking for across the world.”But it may be too late for U.S. states to compete with other countries that have far fewer regulations, said New Hampshire state Rep. Keith Ammon, a Republican who cosponsored a money transmitter bill last year.Ammon thinks blockchain technology will transform human interactions.“It’s akin to Christopher Columbus discovering a new continent,” he said.Mining MoratoriumsIn Massena, there’s an advocacy group working to attract blockchain technology entrepreneurs, said Nancy Smith-Weller, a member of this group and a cryptocurrency enthusiast. But not everything is in the hands of local advocates.The Massena Electric Department recently put a hold on new mining projects until it can figure out how to meet the demand for power. The town has a limited capacity of cheap electricity, and according to one estimate, each bitcoin transaction consumes as much electricity as a U.S. homeowner uses in a month, about 900 kilowatt-hours.Also, in March, the New York Power Authority, which provides some of the town’s electricity, adopted a moratorium on approving cheap power rates for cryptocurrency businesses. After the announcement, Blockchain Industries, a large company that was considering locating in Massena, scrapped its plan, according to Smith-Weller. She says the company hired her to act as a liaison with the town.Not everyone in Massena is so sure that the benefits of having the cryptocurrency industry in town will outweigh the costs.Timmy Currier, the mayor of the village of Massena, which is located within the town, said he is worried that the increased demand for power will raise electric rates and make the power less reliable.Bitcoin companies promise jobs, he said, but there is no guarantee.“They just expect us to believe them,” he said.Despite the moratoriums, O’Shaughnessy wants the companies to come. He said there is plenty of power available from other sources, and the town has no qualms about attracting an industry that may not pan out.Smith-Weller said the businesses will help the town reinvent itself.“I do believe this technology will save Massena.”Stateline home pageSign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research "
82,EDUCATION,Puerto Rico To Shutter 283 More Schools This Summer As Education Crisis Deepens,Dominique Mosbergen,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/puerto-rico-schools-closure_us_5ac7d250e4b09d0a1193b3bb,The U.S. territory's Department of Education blamed plummeting enrollment since the hurricane and ongoing financial woes.,2018-04-06,"Teachers participate in a one-day strike against the government's privatization drive in public education in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on March 19.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ac7d5db2000007d06eb41bb.jpeg?cache=tBEbKxLgti&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In another bleak development for Puerto Rico’s decimated education system, the island’s Department of Education announced Thursday that it would close an additional 283 schools this summer, a 25 percent reduction in the current number of public schools.Puerto Rico Education Secretary Julia Keleher said a sharp decline in student enrollment and the territory’s ongoing economic crisis, especially since the devastation of Hurricane Maria, had prompted the closures. Almost half of all schools are at less than 60 percent of enrollment capacity, Keleher said, with nearly 39,000 fewer students than a year ago. Officials have said several thousand more students are expected to leave the island for the mainland to continue their education in the coming years.“We know it’s a difficult and painful process,” Keleher said of the impending closures, according to The Associated Press. “Our children deserve the best education that we are capable of giving them, taking into account Puerto Rico’s fiscal reality.” The closures are expected save the education department about $150 million, said Keleher. She stressed, however, that no teachers would be laid off but some would be transferred between schools.Hurricane Maria, which devastated the U.S. territory in September, dealt a major blow to Puerto Rico’s education system, which had already been suffering from an enrollment slump. Last summer, 179 public schools on the island were shuttered and 150 more were closed from 2010 to 2015.Following the new spate of closures, just 828 public schools will remain open, AP reported.Teachers and parents have reacted with fury and frustration to the new closures.“This is like killing 300 communities,” Aida Díaz, president of Puerto Rico’s Association of Teachers, told Education Week. “We’re going to have communities that are not going to have any schools. The only place they have to meet is the school.”The association said the school closures would affect 60,000 students and 6,000 teachers, reported Puerto Rico’s El Nuevo Dia newspaper. Díaz estimated that 4,000 non-tenured teachers would leave their jobs regardless of the Education Department’s no-layoffs promise.“I don’t even know where the schools they’re being located to are,” Haydee Del Valle, whose 12-year-old son will need to transfer, told NBC News on Friday. “I don’t know if they’re too far away from us or if the school bus they take now will be able to take them there.”“This makes me sad because this is a great school,” she added.Díaz criticized the Education Department for not being transparent about how it decided which schools to close, noting that 45 of the schools had been recognized as schools of “excellence.”Thursday’s closure announcement comes on the heels of a controversial education reform bill signed in March by Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló. The bill aims to introduce a charter school pilot program and private school vouchers for 3 percent of students.Thousands of teachers went on strike on March 19 to protest the bill.“They think that because our island is vulnerable, because it doesn’t have electricity, that we’re going to let them privatize our schools, get rid of our teachers,” Mercedes Martínez, president of the Puerto Rican Teachers Federation, told NPR in March of the reform effort.

But their Republican counterparts failed to accept a single invitation to a Town Hall For Our Lives, causing the bulk of the events to be planned as “empty chair” town halls, in which the invited lawmakers aren’t expected to show up.To be sure, the organizing process behind Town Hall For Our Lives appeared less seamless than that of March For Our Lives, the massive student-led protest against gun violence held nearly two weeks ago in Washington, D.C., and other cities worldwide.Over a dozen events were added to Town Hall Project’s website just days before April 7, which could make it difficult for some lawmakers to rearrange their schedules given such short notice. In one case, a retired congressman was listed as having been invited, though it was unclear why.HuffPost reached out to all of the roughly 90 Republican members of Congress who were invited to a Town Hall For Our Lives, as listed on Town Hall Project’s website. Ten responded.Representatives for six of the Republican lawmakers who responded to HuffPost’s request for comment ― Sens. Rob Portman (Ohio) and Pat Toomey (Pa.) and Reps. Justin Amash (Mich.), Lou Barletta (Pa.), Bob Goodlatte (Va.) and Jim Renacci (Ohio) ― cited scheduling conflicts as their reasons for being unable to participate. All but one of those spokespeople did not respond when asked if the lawmakers planned to host a town hall on gun violence at a later date.“We don’t have any town halls on the calendar but certainly [are] open to hosting a productive forum to talk about it,” a spokeswoman for Renacci told HuffPost in an email.A spokeswoman for Rep. Pete Olson (R-Texas) told HuffPost that “no invite was extended,” but that he would be unable to attend either way because of a scheduling conflict. Two students organizing separate town halls in Texas disputed her statement.Chris Pino, an 18-year-old senior at Seven Lakes High School in Katy, Texas, told HuffPost that the spokeswoman’s statement that Olson was never invited to a Town Hall For Our Lives was “simply not true.”“I have reached out to him and his office on at least four occasions throughout the past week, both by phone and email,” Pino told HuffPost in an email on Thursday. “Each of those times, I received no definitive response. Today, I finally received a definitive response, which was a no.”“The necessity for dialogue between constituency and representative transcends ideology and party identity,” Pino wrote. “Although elected officials and many of their constituents will disagree on some grounds, dissent in opinion is not a mark of division; rather, it is a building block for unity and for bridging the partisan divide. Simply stated, we must work together in order to succeed as a nation.”A spokeswoman for Rep. Steve Womack (R-Ark.) said his office never received an invitation to a Town Hall For Our Lives, despite the listing on Town Hall Project’s website. HuffPost was unable to connect with an organizer to verify that an invitation was sent. Womack’s spokeswoman did not respond when asked if he planned to attend or host a town hall on gun violence at a later date.One Republican congressman was decidedly against participating in the Town Hall for Our Lives events for a different reason. Tyler Sandberg, a spokesman for Rep. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.), said the lawmaker had hosted a town hall with students Thursday, but would not attend the Town Hall For Our Lives he was invited to on Saturday because of its connection to ProgressNow Colorado, a progressive political advocacy organization.“By all means, young folks should speak their minds,” Sandberg told HuffPost in an email. “But this rally is being organized by ProgressNow — a hate-inspired partisan group looking to raise money and win elections, not solve problems. Mike has no interest associating with the smear merchants at ProgressNow. He is seeking solutions, not stunts.”Coffman’s position was “very disheartening” to Ian Gaskins, a 17-year-old junior at Mountain Range High School in Westminster, Colorado, and an organizer of the Town Hall For Our Lives that had invited Coffman.Gaskins acknowledged that ProgressNow helped Never Again Colorado, a student-led anti-gun-violence group, organize the town hall. But he said he had no idea why Sandberg would call the organization “hate-inspired.”“We are working with other groups just because we haven’t done this before,” Gaskins told HuffPost. “Just because we’re getting help, doesn’t mean it’s not our event. ... We are just students who want to be safe in our schools.”A spokesman for Rep. Ted Budd (R-N.C.) told HuffPost that he is “unable to attend” a Town Hall For Our Lives, but noted he led a roundtable Thursday about school safety with school officials and members of local law enforcement.Not every Democratic lawmaker responded to the Town Hall For Our Lives invitations either. Roughly 20 of them who had been invited had not yet confirmed their attendance as of Friday afternoon, according to Town Hall Project’s website. A much smaller number of Democratic members of Congress were invited to these town halls, likely because they are traditionally already in favor of gun reform legislation. However, a handful of them hosted related forums earlier in the week.Florida Rep. Ted Deutch (D) was one of the dozens of Democratic lawmakers to heed Hogg’s call to action. Deutch hosted a Town Hall For Our Lives on Tuesday. It drew over 1,000 people to the Coral Springs Center for the Arts ― just 3 miles down the road from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Many students, parents and community members encouraged the 17 elected officials present at Deutch’s town hall, including mayors and state legislators, to pursue stricter gun laws in the wake of the Feb. 14 Parkland massacre. A handful of gun rights advocates showed up to the event as well.“Their argument is that guns don’t kill people, that bad people kill people,” Coral Springs Commissioner Dan Daley said after a pro-gun attendee heckled him from the crowd. “Why would you want to make it easy for a bad person to get a gun?”Jimmy Dahman, executive director of Town Hall Project and a former organizer for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, called the students’ efforts “incredibly inspiring.”“These students have shown great determination in wanting to engage in the democratic process,” Dahman told HuffPost. “It’s elected officials’ responsibility to listen to their constituents.”“Democracy is best served when the people show up,” he added.Visit Town Hall Project’s website for an hour-by-hour updated list of Town Hall For Our Lives events."

Her predecessor earned $212,324. Sutton’s new salary is a raise of more than 50 percent from her previous job working for Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas). Brian Johnson, hired as a CFPB senior adviser, makes $239,595. He was sent an offer letter on Dec. 1 with a starting salary of $220,000, but his pay was increased by more than $19,000 by the end of the month.The high pay scale isn’t unusual for the CFPB. Financial regulators offer higher salaries than other Washington agencies ― but both Mulvaney hires are making more than their predecessors and most of their colleagues, the Times said.Disclosure of the fat paychecks comes after President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers have repeatedly advocated reshaping the agency, arguing it has imposed too many regulations on the financial industry, and have tried to cut the amount it pays employees. The latest White House budget proposal recommended a $150 million funding cut. Trump installed Mulvaney, the White House budget director, to temporarily lead the CFPB in November. Mulvaney submitted a report to Congress on Monday encouraging lawmakers to curb the agency’s powers.“The bureau is far too powerful, and with precious little oversight of its activities,” he said in the report.He requested a CFPB budget for the quarter of $0 and said he would fund operations with reserves.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article stated Mulvaney was previously the White House budget director.

With school safety under intense scrutiny following the February mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, advocates say this is a simple way to take a step in the right direction.“This is part of the local and national conscience right now,” said Eric Adkins, a Chattanooga community member who is involved with the coalition.The group says Durham School Services has not made the proper changes to improve safety in the wake of the tragedy, and that its negligence helped contribute to the crash. Indeed, prior to the crash, DSS had received multiple complaints about Walker’s behavior. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration also criticized the company in a post-crash investigation for its negligence.Still, DSS continues to provide service for Hamilton County Schools, the school district confirmed, along with hundreds of others around the country. A spokesperson for the district said it is working to facilitate a face-to-face meeting between the company and the coalition in coming weeks. Included in the group’s letter to districts is a new report written by a Wayne State University professor, which crunches data showing that National Express Group has a worse track record for safety than other major school bus companies. “You have a fairly strong result and that result is just certain companies perform better,” Professor Michael Belzer told HuffPost. The trend of school districts outsourcing transportation to private companies, as opposed to district-run transportation, is worthy of scrutiny, Belzer said. A spokeswoman for DSS told HuffPost the company has made several changes since the crash to improve school safety, and that the presentation of data in the report is misleading. She says the company has already acted to address the recommendations the report provides. “Durham Schools Services is safe, National Express is safe, we are a safe company,” spokeswoman Kate Walden said. The company disagrees sharply with the activist group’s characterization of it.“The data is flawed, so they’ll be sharing school districts with flawed data,” Walden said.But coalition members say they hope school districts will heed their warning and demand accountability from DSS.“We wanted people to know the lives of children should not have died in vain,” Adkins said. “This is not the first school bus related accident that has occurred and it definitely will not be the last.”"

Daniel Akaka was known as an advocate for Native Hawaiians and veterans.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ac7a79c1f00002d0016c8d4.jpeg?cache=MqXcjJbJcf&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Daniel Akaka, the first Native Hawaiian to serve in the U.S. Senate, has died due to organ failure, multiple outlets reported Friday. He was 93.“We are so fortunate to have him as long as we did. We were very lucky,” Akaka’s family said in a statement to Hawaii News Now.The former chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee was known for his attention to the concerns of former service members and push for increased rights for Native Hawaiians.“Senator Akaka lived a life of love, kindness & aloha. I never heard him utter an unkind comment about a single person. He represented the best of Hawai’i and set the highest standard for all us to achieve in terms of human decency,” Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell said in a statement on Twitter.Hawaii’s current members of Congress recalled the former senator fondly.Akaka “embodied the aloha spirit & selflessly dedicated his life to serving others,” Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D) tweeted.Sen. Brian Schatz (D) called the former lawmaker, “A pure heart, a determined warrior for native Hawaiians, and a true public servant.”Akaka began his career as a school administrator. He also worked for the state’s Department of Health, Education and Welfare before being elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1976 to represent Hawaii’s 2nd District. He was subsequently re-elected six times before being appointed to fill a vacancy in the Senate, where he served from 1990 until his retirement in 2013.In the upper chamber, Akaka repeatedly sponsored versions of the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act, known as the “Akaka Bill,” to grant political sovereignty to Native Hawaiians. Opponents criticized the bill as discriminatory against Hawaiians not of native descent.Akaka saw the bill’s failure as a sore spot in his career, remarking when he retired that there seemed to be “always one objection” preventing it from getting to the Senate floor.“It is long past time for the Native Hawaiian people to have the same rights, the same privileges, and the same opportunities as every other federally recognized native people,” Akaka told Hawaii News Now in 2012.Veterans issues were also close to Akaka’s heart, and he was able to focus on them while serving as chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee from 2007 to 2010. Akaka was just 17 years old when Japan bombed Pearl Harbor, and he would go on to join the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and serve in World War II.He later acknowledged that he experienced post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of fighting in the war. In interviews with Hawaii News Now in 2012, he credited the GI Bill with helping him cope with the disorder and pursue a college degree.Many considered Akaka’s Senate record to be unremarkable, and Time magazine in 2006 labeled him a “master of the minor” ― “an affectionate and earnest man” who seemed to have little to show for his decades in office.But to his friends, Akaka was a courageous man ― evidenced by his fierce opposition to the war in Iraq ― who rarely sought the spotlight. “He’s been courageous in speaking out against this misguided war in Iraq from the beginning,” Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) told the Honolulu Advertiser in 2006. “He’s a great personal friend and true man of his word. The U.S. Senate needs Danny’s judgment and his unyielding commitment to making America live up to its highest ideals in the years ahead.”Akaka’s retirement in 2013 marked the end of an era, coming shortly after the death of Sen. Daniel Inouye, another stalwart of Democratic politics from Hawaii. Not only was the Senate losing two long-serving Democrats, but for years Akaka’s name had also been the first one read during Senate roll call votes.“It is almost as if he were part of the Senate procedure,” Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), who was next in line alphabetically and led the roll after Akaka’s departure, told The New York Times in 2013. “It is like a page will be missing from the rule book. It is unsettling, and it is going to take a little getting used to.”"

It’s was the most sick first trimester of all my children,” Hudson wrote on Friday. “If you’ve seen me out and about smiling and pretending like everything is amazing ...

Ryder’s father is musician Chris Robinson of The Black Crowes, who was married to Hudson for seven years. Bingham Hawn Bellamy’s father is Matt Bellamy of the band Muse. "

Bishop, the former president of a Mormon missionary training center (MTC) in Provo, Utah. Denson said she told local Mormon leaders about the assault numerous times over the years, but that the church failed to take action against the leader.Instead, she says, Bishop was allowed to continue holding leadership positions that placed him in charge of hundreds of Mormon youth. Denson said that after trying to seek justice through the church for three decades, she’s “absolutely prepared” to fight it in court. “I’m ready for this,” Denson said Thursday during a press conference in Salt Lake City. “I’ve been ready. I think what makes me feel even more confident [is], I’m right. It happened. I was raped at the MTC. The church covered it up, and they still promoted him to higher and higher positions of the church.”Bishop, who is now 85 years old, denies the rape allegations. In an interview with police last year, he admitted that he had taken Denson to a small “preparation room” at the center and “asked her to show him her breasts, which she did.” Church spokesman Eric Hawkins told HuffPost in an email that the church is confident that the legal system will ensure a just result in this case.“Our hearts ache for all survivors of abuse, and the Church is committed to addressing incidents of abuse wherever they are found,” Hawkins wrote. “As this is now an active legal matter, we are unable to make further comment at this time.”In a previous statement, the church claimed that it did not impose formal discipline on Bishop because it was unable to verify the allegations against him. The church said it is investigating the alleged rape again and would take action against Bishop if it found the claims to be true.Denson’s lawsuit names Bishop and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as defendants, according to The Salt Lake Tribune. Denson’s lawyer, Craig Vernon, said his client is seeking to hold Bishop accountable and that he hopes the lawsuit will also reveal systematic problems the church’s handling of abuse allegations.On March 26, the church updated its guidelines on abuse prevention. The guidelines instruct church leaders to call a church helpline when they learn of possible abuse cases. The helpline reportedly connects the leaders to “legal and clinical professionals” who provide instructions on how to assist victims and comply with local requirements about reporting abuse. Denson also brought up the church’s longheld practice of allowing local leaders, known as bishops, to conduct one-on-one “worthiness” interviews with young children. Some parents have complained that bishops are able to ask children invasive questions about their sexuality during these interviews. The interviews have recently become a controversial subject in the Mormon church. Last week, about 1,000 people marched to the church’s headquarters to demand an end to the practice and make it a requirement for a parent or guardian to sit in on the interviews. The church’s updated abuse guidelines make this an option, not a requirement.In response to a petition from concerned Mormon parents, Hawkins, the church spokesman, issued a statement last December defending bishops’ interviews as an important part of the church’s ministry. Denson said Bishop was able to groom her for abuse because she had already gotten used to the idea that it was OK to be alone in a room with an older man who asked her sexually explicit questions. She said the movement to change the church’s policies on bishop’s interviews was “absolutely vital” to her.“If I had been taught early on that it was not OK to be alone, one on one with a priesthood leader, no matter how high up he is, I honestly believe this would not have happened,” she said."

92,POLITICS,Trump Resists Mounting Pressure To Fire Scandal-Struck EPA Chief Scott Pruitt,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-scott-pruitt_us_5ac7c742e4b07a3485e48b12,White House Chief of Staff John Kelly has been urging the president to oust the EPA administrator.,2018-04-06,Trump and Pruitt in the White House Rose Garden at the president's announcement of the United States' withdrawal from the Paris climate accord last June. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ac7d416200000d30ceb41b8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump has doubled down on his support for Scott Pruitt, resisting mounting pressure week to fire the embattled head of the Environmental Protection Agency. In a series of tweets over two days, he signaled strong support for Pruitt, whom he said was “under siege.” On Friday, the president blamed the reporters who this week broke a series of stories detailing Pruitt’s living arrangements, spending and management of the agency, intensifying accusations of corruption and government waste. On Saturday, the president defended Pruitt’s seven-figure spending on security, insisting ― as Fox News reported ― that the administrator faced death threats, and saying, incorrectly, that Pruitt’s $50-a-night room in a luxury Capitol Hill condo was “about market rate.” The second tweet came a day after The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times published reports detailing White House Chief of Staff John Kelly’s efforts over the past two weeks to convince Trump to fire Pruitt over the ongoing scandals. But, at a White House briefing that afternoon, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders noted that “no one other than the president has the authority to hire and fire members of his Cabinet.” “Right now I don’t have any personnel announcement,” she added.  At least three Republican House members joined Democrats and environmental groups this week to demand Pruitt’s ouster amid a firestorm over his sweetheart deal to rent a room in a luxury townhouse linked to a lobbyist whose clients had business before the EPA. The EPA ethics office retroactively approved the arrangement, but struggled to defend the administrator as new details rapidly emerged. Criticism of Pruitt intensified after reports published Thursday accused the administrator of trying to abuse his vehicle’s emergency sirens to cut through traffic and of reassigning, demoting or forcing out EPA officials who challenged his “unusually large spending.” Other reports this week accused Pruitt of using a loophole in the Safe Drinking Water Act to give two political appointees raises after the White House rejected his original request. Pruitt denied the reports in a blistering Fox News interview. The latest scandals follow months of scrutiny into the cost of Pruitt’s first-class travel. He routinely spent more than $2,000 on flights to his home state of Oklahoma, and to interviews and events in New York City. But Pruitt’s conservative allies mounted a vigorous defense. On Wednesday, Mollie Hemingway, a senior editor at the right-wing Federalist, called Pruitt “Trump’s biggest asset” in a column, and warned the president that “ousting him would be a huge victory” for his opponents. On Thursday, FreedomWorks, the libertarian campaign group founded by fossil fuel billionaires Charles and David Koch, launched a dial-in effort, urging supporters to call the White House and champion Pruitt against a “smear campaign” by “the radical left.” On Friday, The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board advised the president to “show some loyalty to his leading reformer,” calling his decision on the administrator’s future “Trump’s Pruitt Test.”It helps that, on Monday, Pruitt outlined plans to rollback a landmark Obama-era regulation to limit carbon dioxide emission from vehicle tailpipes. The announcement burnished Pruitt’s reputation as the speartip of Trump’s deregulatory agenda. But, as The New Republic’s Emily Atkin laid out, Pruitt’s effectiveness is overstated. At least 10 of the roughly 30 regulatory rollbacks Pruitt has proposed are on hold due to lawsuits, and several have been overturned in federal court. Still, his efforts to scale back the United States’ climate change efforts ― he helped convince Trump to withdraw from the Paris climate accord ― and disqualify huge bodies of research to favor industry-backed studies in crafting regulations have bolstered his favor with Trump. That may be why the president is averse to forcing Pruitt out. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price resigned last September just one week into a scandal over his costly use of chartered flights. But Price lost Trump’s favor months earlier, with the failure of his campaign to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Pruitt also benefits from Republican control of both houses of Congress. Anne Gorsuch Burford, the last EPA administrator to resign in disgrace, faced fierce criticism during her time as President Ronald Reagan’s first head of the agency. Like Pruitt, she contracted the agency’s budget to historic lows and drastically eliminated environmental regulations with an ideological fervor. But she only stepped down in 1983 because the Democratically controlled House cited her for contempt of Congress for refusing to turn Superfund records over to a subcommittee. To Liz Purchia, who served as the EPA’s communications director under President Barack Obama, the White House’s doubling down of support for Pruitt echoes Trump’s repeated endorsement of former Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore. The president continued to back the former judge’s campaign last year for the Heart of Dixie’s open Senate seat amid a deluge of reports detailing Moore’s history of sexual predation of teenage girls. Trump’s support for Moore divided Republicans, though the president quickly distanced himself after Democrat Doug Jones eked out a victory in the special election. “Like with Roy Moore, despite the overwhelming calls for Trump to disown and condemn Pruitt’s actions, he’s doubling down,” Purchia told HuffPost. “Ethics or moral scandals aren’t an issue for Trump. He’ll only act if the constant drip of negative headlines continue for Pruitt like we saw with Roy Moore.”This story was updated to include Trump’s second tweet. "
