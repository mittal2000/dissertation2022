The Board will be conducting an in-depth investigation into alleged inappropriate communications and the nature in which they were obtained. In addition, the Board wishes to reaffirm our commitment to the education and empowerment of young women, supporting them in every way possible.”Former Miss Americas, including 87-year-old BeBe Shopp Waring, who was crowned in 1948, and former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson, who was crowned in 1989, signed an open letter Friday. In it, the women called on Haskell, Miss America President Josh Randle, board Chair Lynn Weidner and board member Tammy Haddad to resign.Haddad also resigned after the letter’s publication, saying that “the women who put their hopes and dreams into this program are the best of America.”The emails that HuffPost revealed included fat-shaming former Miss America Mallory Hagan, who won the pageant in 2013, as well as rumors and innuendo about her sex life. In other instances, Haskell replied “Perfect...bahahaha” to the suggestion that a writer change a telecast script to refer to prior winners as “cunts” and also laughed at an email suggesting one of the winners should die. Emails also suggest organization leadership, particularly Haskell, Weidner and Haddad, worked to destroy one winner’s business as an interview coach to prospective Miss America contestants.

As Miss Americas, we strongly reject the mischaracterizations of us both collectively and individually. We also reject the ongoing efforts to divide our sisterhood and the attempts to pit us against one another,” it says.Atlantic City Mayor Don Guardian joined the women Friday in their campaign. The pageant takes place annually in the city, which helps subsidize the event.Former Miss America CEO Leonard Horn also urged Haskell to leave the organization, saying, “Resign Sam.....your attitude towards these women, as expressed in your e-mails, is blatantly antagonistic to the core mission of MAO.”In a statement to HuffPost in response to the report revealing the emails, the Miss America Organization said it had been notified months ago about the inappropriate emails and had taken action by firing the lead writer for the telecast, the “most egregious author of inappropriate comments.”“The Board has full confidence in the Miss America Organization leadership team,” the organization said. “In addition, the Board wishes to reaffirm our commitment to the education and empowerment of young women, supporting them in every way possible.” See the full letter from the women below:This story has been updated to include Haskell’s suspension, a statement from former CEO Leonard Horn, the Atlantic City mayor’s support and Haddad’s resignation.Follow Yashar — or send him a tip — on Twitter: @yashar"

2,MEDIA,Several Women Accuse Progressive Media Executive Don Hazen Of Sexual Harassment,Carla Herreria,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/don-hazen-accused-sexual-harassment_us_5a3ad9d1e4b06d1621b192d8,One journalist told HuffPost that Hazen mimicked his favorite sex act while having lunch with employees.,2017-12-22,Don Hazen at a book release party in Los Angeles in 2003.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a3c66cf1c0000220068ce52.jpeg?cache=ODiB6PqLzY&ops=crop_9_231_2081_1526%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"A prominent journalist who has led a number of progressive, left-wing media outlets for decades has been accused of sexually harassing female journalists. Several women say that Don Hazen, the executive director of AlterNet and the previous publisher of Mother Jones magazine, sexually harassed and acted inappropriately toward female journalists, BuzzFeed revealed in a report published Thursday.In BuzzFeed’s report, six women, all of whom are journalists or work in media, accused Hazen of openly discussing their sex lives, touching them inappropriately, sending emails detailing sex positions, showing one woman a photo of his erect penis and assessing his female employees’ physical appearances.A seventh female journalist told HuffPost that Hazen would often talk about sex during meetings and once mimicked a sex act with his hands while he was eating lunch with staff.Six of the accusers had worked with Hazen at AlterNet at the time of the harassment. One of the women who spoke to BuzzFeed said she was harassed by Hazen but wasn’t working for him at the time. Some of the incidents date back to 2008. In an initial statement to BuzzFeed, Hazen said he denied “most of allegations as have been presented to me by BuzzFeed, and I believe that others have been mischaracterized.”Later in an interview with the news site, Hazen acknowledged that he had stepped over the line with staff members and failed to recognize the implications of his influence as a supervisor.The board of directors of the Independent Media Institute, the nonprofit parent organization that runs AlterNet, placed Hazen on “indefinite leave” after BuzzFeed revealed the accusations. The board said that no employee had pursued the grievance processed outlined in AlterNet’s employee handbook but added that the organization would now be investigating the claims, according to a statement signed by six of the seven board members.The five women who spoke to BuzzFeed and worked at AlterNet said they were unaware of any company protocol available to report the harassment.Kristen Gwynne, a freelance reporter who had worked for AlterNet from 2011 to 2013, told BuzzFeed that she met Hazen while she was still in journalism school. She said he offered her an internship and, eventually, a full-time job before he began harassing her.Gwynne claims Hazen would hug her and kiss her on the cheek at the office and once pointed toward her breast ― an incident that Hazen said may have been “purely accidental.” Gwynne also said Hazen once showed her a photo of a naked, blond porn star, saying that the woman looked like her, according to BuzzFeed. In a message reviewed by the news site, Hazen asked Gwynne, “Are you going to stop and frisk me” ― referencing a story she wrote on the New York Police Department’s “stop and frisk” procedures ― and suggested the two eat marijuana edibles. In a tweet on Thursday, Gwynne said that “working at AlterNet was the most helpless I ever felt in my life.”“But I was never weak,” she added, “and now Don has no choice but to realize how strong and powerful the women he mistreated have ALWAYS been.”Tana Ganeva, another Hazen accuser who spoke to BuzzFeed, acknowledged on Twitter that Hazen “deserves credit” for giving people the opportunity to break into journalism.Ganeva, formerly a managing editor for AlterNet, said she had once asked Hazen why it seemed like he only hired women who were traditionally attractive. She said he responded by commenting on his employees’ physical appearances.″‘So, basically, what I’m saying is that you don’t have to be attractive to work here, it just helps,’” Ganeva recalled Hazen as replying. She also told BuzzFeed that the AlterNet executive had once showed her a black-and-white photo of his naked and erect penis, which she said he thought was “artistic.”After the report on Hazen was published Thursday, other journalists spoke out to back the claims that the progressive media executive acted inappropriately with women and had a reputation for it.Anne Elizabeth Moore, a journalist and Fulbright Scholar, told HuffPost that Hazen was a “widely known harasser” in the industry and said she had heard stories of Hazen’s behavior. “Stories I heard were always from women about how he made them uncomfortable,” Moore told HuffPost.“I was editing Punk Planet [a culture magazine] at the time, so I didn’t have to deal directly with bullshit, but I did travel in enough progressive circles to know to keep my interactions with him to a bare minimum,” she added.Talking Points Memo reporter Allegra Kirkland also spoke out against Hazen after BuzzFeed’s story went live. She tweeted Thursday, “Don Hazen gave me my first full-time paid job in journalism. Everything in this article is true.”Kirkland told HuffPost that she was an intern at the weekly magazine The Nation when Hazen offered her a job as AlterNet’s associate managing editor. Kirkland said she “eagerly accepted” the opportunity and worked there from June 2014 to April 2015.“I appreciate the work I was able to do there ... but Don was often inappropriate and unprofessional in work settings,” Kirkland told HuffPost in a message, adding that Hazen would “almost always” greet people with a kiss on the cheek, comment on employees’ appearances and “have very lewd conversations about sex” during meetings.The lewd conversations “were usually ostensibly in the context of whatever sex articles the site was going to publish ... but would inevitably turn into discussions of employees’ sex lives, including my own,” Kirkland said.She recalled a lunch she had with Hazen and other AlterNet staffers at a Greek diner in New York, where Hazen had mimicked a sex act with his hands. Kirkland couldn’t remember the exact date but estimated it was winter 2014 or spring 2015.“I explicitly remember going to lunch at a Greek diner on the Upper West Side with a group of New York AlterNet employees and Don talking about how his favorite position was the ‘butterfly’ and sort of mimicking holding a woman’s vagina open with his hands,” Kirkland told HuffPost.“We were eating souvlaki,” she added. “It was the middle of the day. He was making flirtatious eyes at me and a female AlterNet editor while having this conversation.”In an interview with BuzzFeed, Hazen admitted that he had discussed topics like “sex and drugs” during meetings. Hazen confirmed with HuffPost that he hired Kirkland as an intern, but he said he had “no memory of a lunch at a Greek restaurant.”The BuzzFeed article prompted more journalists to comment later Thursday on behavior that appeared to be an “open secret.”Matthew Wheeland, managing editor of Civil Eats, tweeted a link to BuzzFeed’s story, adding that it “could not have happened to a more deserving person.”Wheeland, who had been a managing editor at AlterNet, declined to comment on his tweet.Hazen admitted to BuzzFeed that he may have crossed boundaries with some employees.“In the atmosphere of lots of discussion about editorial topics like sex and drugs, I lost track of some boundaries I needed to keep,” Hazen said. “I had personal conversations with staff I should not have had, made comments I should not have made, and take responsibility for failure to recognize the implications of my position and age in supervising people at that period.”Read BuzzFeed’s full report on Hazen here."
3,POLITICS,Trump Judicial Pick Disputes Allegation That He Lied To Senate About Voter Intimidation Plan,Sam Levine,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/thomas-farr-voter-intimidation_us_5a3bd840e4b025f99e1550bf,A former Justice Department official raised questions about Thomas Farr's Senate testimony.,2017-12-21,"Thomas Farr, nominated for a federal judgeship, denies that he knew about a 1990 voter intimidation scheme before it was executed.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59ea50b4140000610d8c8e97.png?cache=rm27LF10RN&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One of President Donald Trump’s picks for a federal judgeship is pushing back on allegations that he lied to the Senate about his knowledge of a voter intimidation scheme in North Carolina in 1990 ― but he now acknowledges he attended a meeting to discuss “ballot security” shortly before the election. Thomas Farr, now nominated for a district court seat in North Carolina, served as a lawyer to Sen. Jesse Helms’ (R-N.C.) 1990 campaign. Shortly before Election Day that autumn, the campaign sent more than 100,000 postcards to black voters containing incorrect information about voter qualifications and warning that voter fraud was punishable by up to five years in prison.The Justice Department sued over the scheme and eventually settled with a consent decree, though the campaign never admitted wrongdoing. During his confirmation hearing this September, Farr told senators he hadn’t known about the plan until the Justice Department contacted the campaign about it.But J. Gerald Hebert, deputy chief of the Justice Department’s voting section at the time, questioned whether that was true.Hebert, who spoke frequently with the investigators on the case but did not work on it directly, kept contemporaneous notes on cases. His notes show that Farr attended a meeting about “ballot security” in October 1990, before the postcards were sent out. Hebert’s comments were first reported by INDY Week.Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) asked Farr to clarify what he knew about the scheme, and Farr responded on Tuesday, disputing Hebert’s recollection.Farr acknowledged, however, that he participated in a meeting about “ballot security” just before the 1990 election. He said he did not discuss the specific postcards that were eventually sent.“Several weeks before the election, I participated in a short meeting with persons who wanted to be hired to do a ballot security program for the Helms Committee in 1990. During that meeting, I told them there was no reason for them to do a card mailing in 1990 because North Carolina law had been changed and return cards could not be used to challenge voters,” Farr wrote to Booker. “There was no discussion about the content of any hypothetical card. I also told them they might attempt to use returned cards in a recount. However, at the time of this meeting I was doubtful of the utility of any card mailing, even in a recount, because of a change in North Carolina law.”During his confirmation, Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) asked Farr repeatedly about any advice he gave on the postcard mailings.Farr did not disclose the October ballot security meeting, but said that after the Justice Department contacted the campaign, he was “appalled” to learn they had been sent to target African-American voters.“I was appalled to read the incorrect language printed on the card and to then discover it had been sent to African-Americans. I then learned that the Helms Committee intended to use any returned cards to challenge voters on Election Day,” he said in response to a question from Durbin. “After I became aware of this effort, the Helms Committee followed my advice to cancel any and all Election Day activities related to the use of these cards to challenge voters. Based upon my instructions, returned cards were not used to challenge voters.”Farr’s defense comes days after Matthew Petersen withdrew his name for consideration for a seat on the federal bench after a video of him failing to answer basic legal questions went viral. Petersen was the third of Trump’s judicial nominees to drop out.The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights has accused Farr of misleading the Senate and called on him to withdraw his nomination. The NAACP Legal Defense Fund and the Washington Post editorial board have called on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which approved Farr’s nomination in October, to call him back for more questions about the discrepancies.Farr’s claim that he knew nothing about the postcard campaign was complemented by a letter from Carter Wrenn, Helms’ campaign manager in 1990. Wrenn said he had approved the controversial postcard and Farr couldn’t possibly have known about it before it was sent.“First, the actual postcard that was mailed could not have been discussed because it did not exist at the time of the meetings described by Mr. Hebert. And second, the problem with the postcard that was actually mailed was the copy: It was the copy and who the card was mailed to that was the problem,” Wrenn wrote in a letter to Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.). “I never talked with Tom Farr about the actual card that was mailed, the copy, or who it had been mailed to, until after I received the Justice Department letter.”Hebert said Wednesday that Farr’s disclosure of the October meeting contradicts what he told the Senate.“He claimed to Feinstein he had no involvement. He now concedes he met with the ballot security team in mid October,” Hebert told HuffPost in an email. “That team was discussing ways to suppress the vote. That team later sent out the cards, but I never said Farr knew they were doing it. He may have, but he denies it.”Hebert is now the senior director of voting rights and redistricting at Campaign Legal Center, a group that has led legal challenges to voter ID laws and redistricting plans.Farr has come under scrutiny for defending North Carolina’s voter ID law, which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit blocked last year, saying it targeted African-Americans “with almost surgical precision.”"

NYPR did not provide specifics about the behavior in question. “These investigations found that each individual had violated our standards for providing an inclusive, appropriate, and respectful work environment,” Roussel said. “In each investigation, an outside investigator interviewed multiple witnesses as well as Lopate and Schwartz.”Lopate, 77, who for over three decades has hosted a weekday talk show named for him, previously said he was shocked by the accusations.“I have done nothing wrong, and I am really sad that my reputation may be damaged, despite the fact that I have not done anything that I know of that could have led to this situation,” Lopate said in an interview with WNYC News earlier this month. NYPR said in its statement that the recent investigation was not the first time it has had to look into Lopate’s behavior. It conducted a previous inquiry in February after he allegedly made “inappropriate remarks” to his staff. That investigation resulted in a warning and one-on-one anti-harassment training for him. Complaints against Schwartz, 79, host of “The Jonathan Channel” and a music program on weekends, date back to November, NYPR said. He has also faced previous disciplinary action for his behavior. Their accusations follow those against former WNYC host John Hockenberry, 61, who was accused earlier this month of bullying and sexually harassing women throughout a long career at the station, which ended in August. Several other media figures have lost their positions in recent months after facing allegations of sexual misconduct, including Minnesota Public Radio’s Garrison Keillor and NPR’s Michael Oreskes and David Sweeney, CBS’ Charlie Rose and NBC’s Matt Lauer and Mark Halperin.

Despite Schnatter having issuing a clarification and apology for the comments, his dismissal means the storm came full circle ― no matter how you slice it.While the pizza chain’s future was temporarily tossed in the air, it seems to have landed in loyal hands. The company will promote longtime employee and former president Steve Ritchie to the position of CEO.“I am so proud of Steve,” Schnatter said in a company statement announcing the change. “He has excelled at every job he’s ever held at Papa John’s – from being an hourly customer service rep, to a delivery driver, store general manager, director of operations, franchisee and most recently President.”For the good of Papa’s shareholders, hopefully Ritchie can still deliver the dough."

The pop icon, who wraps her “Britney: Piece of Me” residency in Las Vegas on Dec. 31, is set to kick off 2018 by performing her hits “Toxic” and “Work Bitch” on “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve with Ryan Seacrest,” the show has announced. Spears joins a stacked “New Year’s Rockin’ Eve” lineup that includes Shawn Mendes, Nick Jonas and Kelly Clarkson. The star, who turned 36 earlier this month, confirmed the news Thursday on Instagram.“New Year’s Rockin’ Eve” can be a tough gig. Lest we forget Mariah Carey, who rang in 2017 with a disastrous performance that was littered with technical mishaps. (Mimi is ending the year on a much stronger note.) Spears won’t be taking any risks. Unlike Carey, she won’t be crooning to a crowd of revelers from a chilly Times Square.

8,POLITICS,Virginia Will Break Tie For Key Seat By Randomly Pulling A Name From A Bowl,Sarah Ruiz-Grossman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/virginia-elections-tie-breaker-pull-names_us_5a3be721e4b025f99e15760a,At stake is whether Republicans keep their 17-year control of the state's House of Delegates.,2017-12-21,The battle between Republican David Yancey and Democrat Shelly Simonds for a state legislative seat in Virginia now hinges on the luck of the draw.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a3be78c1d00003a004d2daf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In a closely watched, nail-biting race that after a recount and legal challenge ended in a tie, the winner of a crucial state legislative seat in Virginia apparently will be decided by a name pulled out of a bowl next week.Next Wednesday, the names of Democrat Shelly Simonds and Republican David Yancey will be written on pieces of paper, placed into separate film canisters and then put in a bowl. A member of the state Board of Elections then will pull out the winning name, board chair James Alcorn told HuffPost.The stakes are high in this exercise of sheer chance: If Simonds were to win, Republicans would lose majority control of the House of Delegates after 17 years.Earlier this week, a recount had Simonds leading by one vote in Virginia’s 94th House district. But after a challenge by Yancey focusing on a contested ballot that had been ruled invalid, a three-judge panel declared that the vote would count for the Republican incumbent. That made the race a tie, with each candidate receiving 11,608 votes.According to Virginia law, such a tie is to be broken “by lot” ― such as picking a name from a bowl. What’s not entirely clear is whether, after a winner is picked in this race, the loser will have any recourse to challenge the result. Virginia law allows for a recount after a tiebreaker ― but there has already been a recount in this race, as noted by reporter Reema Amin with the Newport News, Virginia-based Daily Press.If Yancey ultimately prevails, the GOP will control the House of Delegates by one seat, 51-49. If Simonds ends up the winner, the two parties will have to work out a power-sharing arrangement in the chamber.While election ties are unheard of in recent U.S.history at the federal level and rare for state offices, they do happen occasionally in local races. And in most states, such ties are broken in the same way Virginia’s will be: by some process of pure chance, including tossing a coin, drawing straws, or picking cards from a deck. The last tie decided by lot in Virginia by the board of elections appears to have been for a House of Delegates seat in 1971.As the new cliffhanger in Virginia awaits resolution ― and control of its lower legislative chamber is determined ― one thing is clear: Every vote can make a difference.

Weier pleaded guilty in August to attempted second-degree intentional homicide, but said she should not be held accountable due to mental illness. The criminal trial stemmed back to a 2014 attack in which Weier and another girl, Morgan Geyser, were accused of stabbing a classmate 19 times in an attempt to gain the favor of the fictional character, Slender Man. All three girls were 12 years old at the time of the incident.The victim survived the attack and was found on a roadside. Weier and Geyser were tracked down later that day on the outskirts of the city and reportedly told police that they were heading to the Nicolet National Forest where they’d live with the fictional creature and his servants in his mansion.Both girls were tried as adults and were found to experience mental health issues. Geyser was diagnosed with schizophrenia and oppositional defiant disorder after her arrest. Weier was diagnosed with a delusional disorder and a condition known as schizotypy.Weier’s sentencing means the teen will spend at least three years in the mental health facility before she is eligible to request supervised release. Upon her release, she would need to remain under state supervision for the remainder of the 25-year sentence.The victim’s mother sent a letter to the judge earlier this week, saying the attack “has defined our lives.” She said that her daughter frequently slept with scissors under her pillow after the attack and still keeps her bedroom windows locked, CBS News reported.“She will struggle with the events of that day and physical and emotional scars it left for the rest of her life,” the girl’s mother wrote.Geyser also entered a guilty plea for the attack and will be sentenced in February, The Associated Press reported."

The World Health Organization has recorded 2,219 deaths since the cholera epidemic began in April, with children accounting for nearly a third of infections.Cholera, spread by food or water contaminated with human feces, causes acute diarrhea and dehydration and can kill within hours if untreated. Yemen’s health system has virtually collapsed, with most health workers unpaid for months.On Dec 3, the WHO said another wave of cholera could strike within months after the Saudi-led coalition closed air, land and sea access, cutting off fuel for hospitals and water pumps and aid supplies for starving children.The ports were closed in retaliation for a missile fired from Yemen by the Houthis. On Wednesday, despite a fresh missile attack on Riyadh, Saudi Arabia said it would allow the Houthi-controlled port of Hodeidah, vital for aid, to stay open for a month."

Stretch your arms out. Lift our shirt and let security see inside your waistband. Yes. It’s mandatory. Some of the homeless spending the night at the shelter acknowledge that it’s a necessary security precaution, but many still resent it. They grumble that it’s humiliating, disheartening, and invasive. “It makes me feel like I’m a criminal” is a common refrain. The procedure will not change on any night of the year. It may be especially disheartening on nights that are about sharing good spirits and tidings. A night like Thanksgiving. This year I spent Thanksgiving night at the Interfaith Community Shelter.The shelter served a traditional Thanksgiving meal. The shelter guests admit they’re “cold” and ‘tired” so they devour the meal in between muttered comments. “Pretty good.” Most barely say a word – before or after eating. A man in stained, baggy overalls and an unclean shirt studies his plate with a terrifyingly fixed stare. Then he glares at me – a visiting journalist. Have I upset him?He probably thinks that because he hasn’t seen me before I must be a “first timer” at the shelter, so he blurts, “The food’s not bad. But wait till you have turkey, cranberry sauce and stuffing every day for the next two months. Happy Thanksgiving.”Is he ungrateful? Is he one of the stereotypically “freeloading” homeless? He’s sarcastic—yes—but I suspect by his monotone intonation, and by his hunched, defeated shoulders that his cynical wit camouflages his state of severe depression. He may suffer clinical depression, or a myriad other psychological conditions common in those with no homes.Nobody could confuse the shelter for anything else than a place to spend a night inside – where night guests are invited inside at 7 p.m., and they’re reminded at 9:45 p.m. that “If you go out, you can’t come back again,” because the shelter locks down, and lights go out at 10 p.m.The only spirit of the holiday is on a wall behind the large communal dining table. There’s a poster board where guests have voluntarily scribbled thankful appreciations.The poster board is filled with mostly traditional thanks for friends, family, and life. But, looking carefully, I see that somebody resentfully scribbled, “Nothing and nobody cares.”Frustration is inevitable. The shelter guests feel simultaneously appreciative, and burdened by knowing that they’re victims. They will be victimized throughout the winter season by snow, rain, and despite tonight’s Thanksgiving meal, they will often be victimized by hunger. They’re frustrated because many of their problems could be ameliorated, if society focused on the reasons why homelessness exists rather than stereotypes that absolve us of a feeling of guilt or responsibility.Homelessness is a result of a lack of social resources. These include a lack of resources for individuals with addiction issues, and the mentally ill who have lost control over their lives. The problem can’t be explained away by conveniently pigeonholing all of the homeless within those categories, however.The primary reason for the sharp rise in homelessness over the past twenty years has been the dramatic increase in rental costs, and the shortage of affordable housing.Of the estimated 564,708 homeless persons in America, many are children and many are adults who fell into homelessness because their earnings couldn’t keep pace with exorbitantly rising rental costs. I continued visiting the Interfaith Shelter throughout early December. The weather was turning colder. Christmas time at the shelter is the season of worry about the deadly threat of hypothermia. The shelter was crowded every night. There’s also a much higher incidence of coughing, illnesses, and the flu. I met several shelter residents who decidedly insisted they didn’t belong in the “mentally ill” or “addicted” categories. They became homeless, basically, because they were poor. I met – for example – Cindy, a late-fiftyish woman who had a long history of working as a waitress. A year ago, she was living in one of those fly-by night motels that have become an increasingly common option for poor people who can’t pay rental deposits. Cindy subsequently spent three months living in her car. The cold winter nights convinced her to sleep at the Interfaith.She was having second thoughts, even here, however. Yes, she appreciated the warmth. But the coughing – the wheezing – troubled her. Some nights Cindy worried about sharing the bunk-bedrooms with so many sickly roommates. She couldn’t afford to catch the flu herself. Which was the better alternative? Risking freezing in her car? Or risking catching pneumonia?“The main thing you need to know about the shelter is this – nobody is here because they want to be here. Everybody who is here has to be here Just like me,” she says.Cindy says she will try to stick it out at the shelter through the winter, in particular because case workers at the Interfaith are helping her. The case workers tell her that realistically at least a year will go by before she might land an affordable housing unit. Though Cindy finishes every conversation by saying “Merry Christmas” or “Have a happy new year” the truth is that Cindy faces limited options this coming year. It’s the truth for all the homeless. Its reality traps them in a situation of one anxiety after another, or close to constant state of helplessness and fear. Society needs to respond by making a Christmas commitment to funding homeless shelters, social services and housing programs, and educating ourselves that homelessness has root causes that are remediable.Darryl Lorenzo Wellington is a communications fellow at the Center for Community Change and a poet who recently published the chapbook “Life's Prisoners.”"
12,MEDIA,New York Times Decides Not To Fire Glenn Thrush After Accusations Of Misconduct,Carla Herreria,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-york-times-glenn-thrush_us_5a3afcafe4b025f99e14760b,"An internal investigation at the paper concluded that Thrush had acted offensively but ""does not deserve to be fired.""",2017-12-21,"New York Times reporter Glenn Thrush is seen on Feb. 24, 2017, in Washington, D.C.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a3b2329160000783ecf2673.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The New York Times has decided it will not fire Glenn Thrush, the White House reporter who has been accused of inappropriate behavior and unwanted advances toward female colleagues, the paper announced in a statement Wednesday.Thrush is expected to remain suspended from the Times without pay until late January. Upon his return, he will no longer be able to cover the White House, widely considered a prestigious beat for political reporters.After a Vox report published in November described Thrush’s alleged misconduct against female journalists, including nonconsensual kissing, groping and touching, the Times suspended Thrush and launched a month-long internal investigation into the matter.The investigation found that Thrush had acted inappropriately, but in the Times’ view, his actions weren’t bad enough to warrant his ousting from the paper.“While we believe Glenn has acted offensively, we have decided that he does not deserve to be fired,” New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet said in a statement. Thrush will attend trainings to “improve his workplace conduct” and will undergo personal counseling and substance abuse rehabilitation, the statement said.“We undersand that our colleagues and the public at large are grappling with what constitutes sexually offensive behavior in the workplace and what consequences are appropriate,” Baquet said. “It is an important debate with far-reaching consequences that we helped spark with our journalism and that we’ve been reflecting on internally as well.”When asked by HuffPost what the Times hopes to achieve by demoting Thrush instead of firing him, a company spokeswoman declined to comment beyond Baquet’s statement.Before Thrush was hired at the Times in December 2016, he worked for Politico as a senior reporter. He was known in the industry as a talented political reporter.The incidents that the Times found not to be fireable offenses involve Thrush allegedly groping, touching or kissing young female journalists without consent.Vox’s November report included accounts from four women ― including the story’s author, Laura McGann, who interviewed 40 people while reporting the piece. The other three women were not named in the story.McGann said her incident with Thrush happened five years ago, when they both worked for Politico. According to McGann, she and Thrush went to a bar with other reporters in Virginia, and they were the last two from the group to remain at the bar when Thrush advanced on her: He slid into my side of the booth, blocking me in. I was wearing a skirt, and he put his hand on my thigh. He started kissing me. I pulled myself together and got out of there, shoving him on my way out.The other women McGann spoke to for her piece said they experienced similar situations. One woman said Thrush left her in tears after he kissed her even though she had resisted his advances. The alleged incident prompted the woman’s friend to confront Thrush via text.Another woman told McGann that Thrush suddenly planted a wet kiss on her ear during a 2013 staff party for Politico. A third woman said that when she was too drunk to drive after a party, Thrush offered her a ride home and entered her apartment. That woman said the interaction was consensual, but she wanted to share her story nonetheless.McGann also found that Thrush allegedly spread gossip in his professional circles, claiming that young female journalists were the ones making sexual advances toward him and that he would turn them down.Many people were upset with the Times’ decision to keep Thrush on staff ― including Ellen Pao, the former Reddit CEO who filed and lost a sex discrimination lawsuit against a prominent Bay Area venture capital firm.Jessica Valenti, a feminist writer and author of the memoir Sex Object, said the Times’ decision not to fire Thrush is a “signal to women that their careers are not as important as men’s.”Joshua Hunt, a freelance journalist, accused Baquet of enabling predatory behavior.Thrush was working on a book about President Donald Trump with reporter Maggie Haberman, but Random House, the publishing company, said the book will move forward without Thrush’s name attached, the Times reported."

At a recent Bioneers Conference appearance in Marin County, CA, Van Dyck offered thoughts on how to speed up the clean energy transition.Now a financial advisor for RBC Wealth Management where he advises on more than $2 billion in environmentally sustainable investments, Van Dyck shared insights that were also drawn from more than four years of work with the Divest/Invest movement. The organization urges investors to “join the global investor movement accelerating the sustainable energy transition” by divesting their fossil fuel assets.Myth Busting“California has actually been able to grow our economy on a per capita basis without increasing per capita energy demand,” he said. Because Republicans own the carbon, according to Van Dyck, “they want you to keep burning it, okay? You don’t need to do that.”Van Dyck displayed a graph showing that while the state’s GDP has been growing at over two percent annually between 2000 and 2015, its greenhouse gas emissions per capita have fallen while its total emissions declined about six percent. Thus, California produces only half the greenhouse gases per dollar of GDP as the national average, Van Dyck noted.“So the whole idea that you’re not growing your economy under cleaner renewable energy—where you’re not off-gassing health problems to low-wealth communities and killing them with asthma—is once again false,” he said.Oil-Free TransportationIn California, about 40 percent of greenhouse gas emissions are generated by transportation, Van Dyck pointed out. “So if everybody here—and all our friends and neighbors—goes out and makes their next purchase an electric car, we can literally put a stake in the heart of the fossil fuel industry by decoupling our addiction to oil and moving to renewable energy to power that car.”“The car is basically a mobile computer,” Van Dyck added. “So that innovation could catalyze very quickly.” He pointed to Proterra, a large bus manufacturer in Torrance, CA that now markets an electric bus that he said can go 1,000 miles on a charge.“So now you have these buses that are no longer range-bound. ... We should not be buying another diesel bus in San Francisco, in LA, in Sacramento or anywhere,” he asserted.A Stealth StrategyVan Dyck then offered his audience, which included many social change activists and young people, a “fly beneath the radar” strategy for boosting clean energy jobs and renewable energy adoption.“Solar energy jobs are everywhere if you choose to use them,” Van Dyck said. “California has benefited because we’ve embraced it. A hundred thousand jobs.”“These jobs could be all across the United States if local public utility commissions (PUCs) choose to pass renewable portfolio standards that mandate 100 percent renewable power,” he said.“Once again that means your involvement,” Van Dyck said. “That means everybody here’s involvement to take over the PUC before the Koch brothers find out that that’s their Achilles’ heel.“If we can take control of that,” he proposed, “we can dictate where the renewable energy needs to be done, we can drive that change through a local democratic process. We don’t need Washington.Storing Renewable PowerReferring to affordable electricity storage as the “Holy Grail” of clean energy deployment, Van Dyck predicted that if its cost “gets below $200 dollars per kilowatt hour, then we can produce solar and wind and other sorts of renewables and deliver it at when the sun is not shining and the wind is not blowing.”He foresees further steep imminent declines in energy storage costs. “When Elon [Musk] finishes that Giga plant in Nevada [where Tesla plans to produce vast numbers of EV batteries], the cost will be about $180 a kilowatt-hour. When the Chinese and the Koreans finish their plant, it’s going to be closer to $100 a kilowatt-hour. The lower it goes, the more affordable renewables become and that’s all externalities included,” he added.“Don’t be fooled when they say, ‘Wait a minute, your solar is at six cents a kilowatt hour. Coal is at four cents a kilowatt-hour,’” he explained. “Coal is not at four cents a kilowatt hour. That’s not including any of the externalities associated with health care, mountaintop removal, miners’ [illnesses and injuries]—none of that.”“Game Over” for Fossil Fuels“If you want to know what the true cost of coal is, the As You Sow Foundation did a study about five years ago. We determined it to be closer to 24 cents a kilowatt-hour if you take all the externalities that fly off the [coal company and the utilities] balance sheets to land on taxpayers’. We’re picking up the tab for those externalities that come off the balance sheets of these coal plants, he noted.“That is not a free market. Free markets are against subsidies, right? Pollution is a subsidy that needs to be included in the cost of power, because cost-price integration is the way of the future. That means the true cost borne by that product stays on the balance sheets of those companies,” Van Dyck concluded.“It [shouldn’t] fly off the balance sheets and land on our balance sheets because we’re subsidizing it, right? We want true cost-price integration. We want pollution to be viewed as a subsidy.”If all fossil fuel subsidies are eliminated and renewables were allowed to fight the fossil fuel industry on a level playing field, Van Dyck asserted, “it will be game over for the fossil fuel industry.”_________________The opinions expressed here are those of the participants and do not necessarily reflect those of RBC Wealth Management.The 28th annual Bioneers Conference where Van Dyck spoke took place October 19th -22nd at the Marin County Civic Center and drew upwards of 3,000 participants.

She said she’s in “excruciating pain” and must have weekly treatments for damage to her remaining foot.Still, Wasser is using her ordeal to help others.She’s been raising awareness about the potential risks of tampons, which have been associated with toxic shock syndrome, and promoting legislation pushed for years by Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) to mandate further research on feminine hygiene products. “I think this is my purpose and I wouldn’t change it for the world,” Wasser told the Post.Wasser went home from a party feeling ill in October 2012 and woke up several days later with organ failure, perilously close to death, according to reports. Doctors diagnosed her with toxic shock syndrome after they tested the tampon she was wearing that night. An infection led to gangrene, and her right leg was amputated below the knee.Toxic shock syndrome results from a “rare” complication of certain bacterial infections, and “has been associated primarily with the use of superabsorbent tampons,” the Mayo Clinic website says.In 2015, Wasser sued the Kimberly-Clark Corp., which manufactures the Kotex tampons she used, for being “unlawfully responsible in some manner.” The company told the Post that “the matter had been resolved.” Wasser declined to comment on the litigation.“My legs were everything,” Wasser told the Post. “I had no idea what my life would be like without them.”"
15,POLITICS,Law Clerks Say Federal Judiciary Isn't Equipped To Handle Sexual Harassment,"Dana Liebelson, Jennifer Bendery, and Ryan J. Reilly",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/federal-court-clerk-sexual-harassment-judges_us_5a3acf5ae4b025f99e1449f8,"They want ""significant changes.""",2017-12-21,Federal Judge Alex Kozinski announced his retirement on Monday amid allegations of serial sexual misconduct.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a3ad31d160000783ecf25be.jpeg?cache=BFrTtQjTXH&ops=crop_7_446_1913_1214%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The federal judiciary is ill-equipped to handle allegations of sexual harassment and “significant changes” are necessary to ensure those working for the third branch of the U.S. government are protected, a group of nearly 700 current and former federal judicial clerks and employees wrote in a letter to Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and other key members of the judiciary on Wednesday.The letter, obtained by HuffPost, was sent two days after Alex Kozinski, one of the nation’s most high-profile federal appeals court judges, announced his retirement following accusations from multiple former female clerks of inappropriate sexual behavior. (He has since apologized.) Kozinski forced the federal judiciary into the national conversation about sexual harassment in the workplace, but his case also highlights why tackling this problem can be particularly difficult for those working for powerful judges.Federal judges have life tenure, and just a handful throughout U.S. history have been removed through impeachment. There is a significant power imbalance between judges and clerks, and between clerks and other court staff. Clerks are typically young attorneys working in highly sought-after positions that could make or break their legal careers, and federal judges work with them in close quarters. It’s a system that stresses confidentiality, and employees may feel there’s nowhere to turn if they run into problems.There’s a risk that this secrecy can be used to shield or even enable harassment, the signatories of Wednesday’s letter argue. Those who signed the letter ― 695 people in all, including 480 former judicial clerks, 83 current clerks and 120 law professors, according to organizers ― say the Federal Judicial Center’s Law Clerk Handbook needs more specific guidance on these issues, and they are unaware of a central place for employees to turn when faced with harassment. “In the past, clerks have been told to report any harassment to their judge or that any reports of harassment will be provided to their judge,” the letter states. “This system is flawed for a number of reasons, including that the judge may be the perpetrator of the misconduct or the clerk may be new to the environment.”Worked in the federal judiciary and have a tip about workplace harassment? You can email us confidentially: dana.liebelson@huffpost.com, ryan.reilly@huffpost.com or jen.bendery@huffpost.com.There is already a formal system to handle misconduct complaints against federal judges. A person can file a complaint, and a chief circuit judge decides whether to appoint a special committee of judges to investigate and, if warranted, issue sanctions. (A judge may also resign before that happens.) But while the misconduct complaint system covers workplace conduct, employees may not be adequately informed about it, or may not be sure if a complaint rises to a level that warrants reporting. Additionally, the system is only designed to handle complaints against judges, so it’s not a venue for complaints against other court employees.The federal judiciary “doesn’t want Congress interfering in this process or taking it over, so they have a pretty strong self-interest in self-policing,” said Arthur Hellman, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh and an expert on federal judicial ethics. However, he noted there is still room for improvement. “It’s essential that the Circuit Chief Judge make two things clear: first, that if a judge in the circuit is doing something wrong, the chief judge wants to know about it; and second, that anyone filing a good-faith complaint will be protected from retaliation,” Hellman said. The Federal Judicial Center made a change earlier this week to the Law Clerk Handbook, intended to clarify that confidentiality rules shouldn’t prevent employees from revealing misconduct, including sexual or other forms of harassment, by any person. Clerks, the handbook now says, “are encouraged to bring such matters to the attention of an appropriate judge or other official.”That line helps, but the letter’s signatories say more needs to be done, as the handbook still provides inadequate guidance on this topic. They also want a confidential national reporting system that employees can access to report harassment. Such a system would “provide a channel for action outside of contacting the press or simply hoping that the situation goes away,” they said. It’s hard to know the extent of sexual harassment in federal courts. But federal judges themselves have been formally accused of sexual misconduct before. Samuel Kent, a former U.S. district judge for the Southern District of Texas, pleaded guilty in 2009 to lying to investigators who were looking into whether he sexually abused court employees. In 2009, Kent ― who was reportedly known to boast “I am the government” ― was sentenced to prison and later impeached. In a deposition taken in March 2014, a former deputy clerk said that around 1998, Walter Smith, then a judge on the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, asked her to come into his office, where he put his arms around her, kissed her and said, “Let me make love to you.” She said she “just panicked... I was like, how am I going to get out of here without making him angry?” She said she was told Smith had a reputation for “pushing himself on whoever he wanted.” The woman said she reported the incident to her supervisor at the time. But Smith continued to pursue her, and she cleaned out her desk. Eventually, she said in the deposition, the judge in charge of dealing with sexual harassment complaints was notified, but he called to ask her: “What do you want me to do about it?”Ty Clevenger, an attorney known for taking on public officials, lodged a complaint against Smith in 2014. A judicial council reprimanded Smith, saying he “does not understand the gravity of such inappropriate behavior.” Clevenger appealed, saying the disciplinary measures were too lenient and he believed there were other incidents. Further investigation was conducted ― the council concluded that Smith’s actions did not warrant a recommendation for impeachment ― but Smith retired in September 2016, ending the possibility of sanctions. (Clevenger said the woman declined to comment. Smith could not be reached for comment.)One federal judge in California, who requested anonymity to speak freely, told HuffPost that among the complaints he has seen against judges on his court over the years, there haven’t been a lot of sexual misconduct allegations.But the power imbalance is so significant, from how judges present physically ― in a robe, sitting above other people, in huge chambers ― to the constitutional role itself, that the judiciary must be particularly vigilant about inappropriate behavior.The federal judge said a far bigger problem than sexual harassment, in his experience, is complaints of bullying ― “when you have the power, you’re under pressure, you’re tired, somebody makes a mistake and you just level them. I’ve seen that.”And in those cases, he said, the chief judge of the court has to tell the judge: “Look, you have way too much power to do something like this. You do this, you know perfectly well she or he can’t fight back.”UPDATE: Dec. 21 ― On Wednesday, Roberts called for a review of the federal judiciary’s procedures for protecting court employees from misconduct. He made the call as the law clerks’ letter was being circulated.Read Wednesday’s letter below:"
16,POLITICS,The Real Story Behind Kristi Noem's 'Death Tax' Ordeal,Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-real-story-behind-kristi-noems-death-tax-ordeal_us_5a3c1874e4b06d1621b2fe00,The South Dakota Republican's family seems to have had enough cash to pay the estate tax.,2017-12-21,Rep. Kristi Noem speaks during a news conference in the Capitol after the House passed the GOP's tax reform bill.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a3c1a311d000027004d2e99.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The federal estate tax is so burdensome that Rep. Kristi Noem’s family spent 10 years in debt just to pay the bill after her father died in a farming accident, the South Dakota Republican has repeatedly claimed throughout her political career.Republican leaders love this tale of hardship so much they appointed Noem to the committee that negotiated the final version of their tax legislation, which will make the estate tax far more lenient, a change Republicans say will protect farms and small businesses. But documents from Noem’s father’s estate show the congresswoman has omitted important details. After her father died in 1994, Noem’s mother received a life insurance payout big enough to pay the estate tax bill several times over, according to documents that HuffPost obtained from Hamlin County’s clerk of courts.Since taking office during the Tea Party wave of 2010, Noem, who is now running for governor of South Dakota, has never mentioned the insurance nor disclosed the amount of the tax, though she’s characterized it as a crushing burden.“We had a tough choice: sell off a portion of our family farm or face a decade in debt,” Noem wrote in a Fox News op-ed last month. “We took a decade in debt and struggled to keep our heads above water.”Taxes can indeed be a burden, but Noem’s story shows that contrary to Republican talking points about how the “death tax” hurts farmers and small business owners, the tax actually comes with special provisions designed to accommodate them. In Noem’s case, it was a fluke the tax hit her family at all: Noem’s father, Ron Arnold, had an outdated will that failed to utilize a marital deduction allowing the entirety of an estate to pass to a surviving spouse untaxed. In other words, if it weren’t for poor planning Arnold’s estate wouldn’t have faced any tax.Probate documents show the land, machinery, livestock and other property owned by Arnold were worth $4.5 million. After subtracting debts and other deductions, the taxable estate came to $1 million. Though the documents don’t specify how much estate tax was owed, experts say it was probably about $169,000. A six-figure tax bill is nothing to sneeze at, but neither is a seven-figure insurance payout. Though Noem’s father had failed to update his will, he had done a good job of making sure his family would have some cash. Noem’s mother received $1.1 million from her husband’s life insurance policies, most of which she apparently loaned to the estate. Noem has refused to answer HuffPost questions about the estate over the course of several brief interviews in U.S. Capitol building hallways over the past few weeks, except for one interview in which she incorrectly said her father didn’t have a will. In an op-ed for the Argus Leader, Noem said the probate documents corroborated her story. Her office has declined to provide information in response to specific questions about the documents.On Tuesday, after the House voted on its tax legislation, HuffPost asked Noem why an estate tax bill for an estimated $169,000 would have been so burdensome for a family that received $1 million worth of life insurance. It could have been the case, for instance, that other debts were more pressing ― but Noem kept walking and said nothing.She spoke up when HuffPost noted that Republicans had used her family story to justify reducing the estate tax. “It’s not the justification,” Noem said. “This policy is bad policy, so it needs to be ended. It’s an unfair double tax.”In the 1990s, the estate tax had a graduated rate schedule, which would have produced a $168,538 tax for a taxable estate worth $1 million, said Robert Lord, a Phoenix, Ariz., tax lawyer and fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies, a progressive think tank.The tax can be deferred for the portion of an adjusted gross estate that is a farm or closely held business and then paid in installments over a decade. Since about half of Arnold’s adjusted gross estate related to the farm and half came from his life insurance policies, the estate would have been able to pay half the $168,535 on the IRS installment plan.A filing from 1995, the year after Arnold died, indicates the estate’s trustees had assumed responsibility for the “balance of the federal estate tax due in the amount of approximately $84,454.00 plus interest accruing” ― roughly half of Lord’s estimate for the full tax.The debt Noem has repeatedly referenced may have been the installment plan, which at the time offered a 4 percent interest rate ― less than half the prime interest rate in 1995. (Today the installment plan for farms and businesses offers a 2 percent interest rate.)“The ability to effectively borrow that $84,000 portion of the estate tax liability and pay it back to the IRS over 10 years, the terms are such that you would take advantage of that and keep that loan outstanding while paying off every other debt,” Lord said.Noem’s office did not respond when HuffPost asked specifically if Arnold’s estate had opted for the installment plan. Lord said Arnold probably bought the insurance specifically so that a portion of it could be used to deal with the estate tax. Other estate tax experts agreed it would be reasonable to take advantage of the favorable IRS terms for the farm portion of the estate.Estate attorney Beth Kaufman, president of the tax law firm Caplin & Drysdale, said there are three main reasons someone might buy life insurance. One is simply to provide for a family that loses its main breadwinner, another is to use as an investment and the third is to generate cash for paying the estate tax. Kaufman said that because the insurance wound up as part of Arnold’s estate ― instead of in a tax-advantaged trust ― Arnold may have simply bought the insurance for the more traditional reason of providing for his family.  “When people buy life insurance for estate liquidity purposes they almost always put their insurance in a life insurance trust,” Kaufman said. Roughly 8 percent of estates that had farm assets were valuable enough to be subject to the tax but didn’t have enough liquidity to pay it in 2000, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That’s about 138 estates that either had to use the installment plan or sell physical assets such as land. But back then, the tax kicked in for estates worth more than $650,000. Today the first $11 million of a married couple’s estate is exempt from tax, and for people who die next year, the exemption level will be $22 million thanks to the Republican tax plan. Only about 5,500 estates are taxable annually under current law, according to the Tax Policy Center, which amounts to 0.2 percent of all estates and roughly 80 farms and businesses. The overall number of taxable estates will fall to 1,700 under the new law.Arthur Delaney co-hosts the HuffPost Politics podcast:"
17,POLITICS,All 6 Defendants Not Guilty In Key Felony Trial Of Trump Inauguration Protesters,Ryan J. Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-inauguration-protesters-not-guilty_us_5a37e6c2e4b040881becafe2,The case could determine the fate of many of the nearly 200 people arrested during the inauguration.,2017-12-21,Detained demonstrators hold a sign during a protest before President Donald Trump's inauguration in D.C. on Jan. 20.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a37e8cf150000490049c45c.jpeg?cache=5CklQ653D6&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"All six defendants in a crucial trial involving demonstrators arrested during President Donald Trump’s inauguration were found not guilty of all charges on Thursday.The trial of the six defendants ― Jennifer Armento, Oliver Harris, Brittne Lawson, Michelle Macchio, Christina Simmons and Alexei Wood ― began in mid-November. It raised major First Amendment issues and was seen as a bellwether that could determine whether the government will proceed with the prosecutions of many of the nearly 200 other defendants who have trials scheduled throughout the next year.Despite Thursday’s verdict, Justice Department prosecutors appeared ready to take all of the remaining defendants to trial.“The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia believes that the evidence shows that a riot occurred on January 20, 2017, during which numerous public and private properties were damaged or destroyed,” the office said in a statement. “This destruction impacted many who live and work in the District of Columbia, and created a danger for all who were nearby. The criminal justice process ensures that every defendant is judged based on his or her personal conduct and intent.”“We appreciate the jury’s close examination of the individual conduct and intent of each defendant during this trial and respect its verdict,” the statement continued. “In the remaining pending cases, we look forward to the same rigorous review for each defendant.”The defendants in the case decided Thursday were in a large group that police encircled (or “kettled”) and arrested en masse in downtown D.C. on Jan. 20, just before Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. Authorities acted after some people in D.C. smashed windows and spray-painted cars and buildings in the city that day.The first six to go on trial include a photographer who had solicited a news outlet for inauguration-related work and two women who acted as “street medics” that day and were carrying medical supplies.Justice Department prosecutors representing the U.S. government conceded at the beginning of the trial that there was no evidence any of the six defendants engaged in any property destruction or violence on Jan. 20. But they alleged the defendants were part of a rioting conspiracy and should be held responsible for more than $100,000 worth of property damage sustained that day. Jurors heard from several employees and business owners who had their windows smashed, as well as police officers who responded to the chaotic scene as it unfolded over roughly 33 minutes. D.C. Superior Court Judge Lynn Leibovitz, a former homicide prosecutor who has generally issued rulings favorable to the prosecution, issued a judgment of acquittal on a felony count of inciting a riot, ruling that no reasonable juror could have found any of the defendants guilty of that charge based on the evidence presented by the government. But she allowed the rest of the charges ― two misdemeanor rioting charges and five felonies in connection with property destruction ― to go to the jury.Some of the defense attorneys have portrayed the case as the Trump administration’s attempt to crack down on anti-Trump speech, pointing out to jurors that the attorneys prosecuting the case work for the Justice Department. The Justice Department has 94 U.S. attorney’s offices throughout the country, but the District of Columbia office is unique in that it handles both federal and local crimes, which would normally be handled by local prosecutors.“The United States of America, ladies and gentlemen ― you saw the logo on there, the Justice Department logo ― comes here, I submit to you, seeking to criminalize Mr. Harris’s First Amendment rights,” argued Steven McCool, a former federal prosecutor who is defending Harris, one of the six people on trial in the case.Sara Kropf, an attorney representing Lawson — a cancer nurse who had to quit her job due to the trial — also implied that the case was being driven by top Justice Department leaders like Attorney General Jeff Sessions.“That’s who they are. Not our local prosecutors. The federal government. We know who they report to,” Kropf said. “This is about politics.”Attorneys also suggested the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia is only pursuing the case to protect the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, which appears to have violated D.C. regulations laying out how law enforcement is supposed to handle demonstrations in the nation’s capital. Video showed officers shooting pepper spray with abandon and using questionable force against individuals who didn’t appear to pose any threat. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jennifer Kerkhoff, who led the prosecution, told jurors that the defendants were privileged and entitled for suggesting that D.C. police follow their rules and issue a dispersal order before conducting a mass arrest.Defense attorneys also zeroed in on the biases of Metropolitan Police Department Detective Gregg Pemberton, who has been investigating the inauguration unrest every working day since Jan. 20. Pemberton had sent anti-activist tweets and written disparagingly about Black Lives Matter.

Disney, wants you to be infuriated about the Republican tax bill.She explains why in a powerful NowThis video on Wednesday, pointing out that the legislation means a “very fat tax cut” for her on income she “did not do anything to earn.”“This bill will give me this tax cut while also killing health insurance for over 13 million people,” Disney said. “It will let me pass over $20 million to my children, tax-free. And all my friends with private jets? They get a tax cut too.”Disney fears that the idea of social mobility, that kids from a poor family can achieve the American dream — as her grandfather Roy and great-uncle Walt, did — is quickly becoming unrealistic.“But I will be able to stay comfortably right where I am,” she said. “Does that strike you as fair?”Disney also references President Donald Trump’s campaign promise to “drain the swamp.”“Given how this bill was written, I think it’s looking a lot like a nightmare from ‘Pirates of the Caribbean,’” she said. “Have I made you angry yet? I really hope I’ve made you angry. You should be. No one who votes for this tax bill will be voting with your life in mind. But you will pay for it.”In a 2015 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Disney, who is a documentary filmmaker, said she has always felt like a rebel in her conservative family. When she attended Columbia University, she recalled being so anxious about her peers viewing her as a snob that she had a cab drop her off blocks from school. In 2014, when Meryl Streep called Walt Disney a “bigot,” his grandniece publicly agreed by posting on Facebook how much she loved the actress’s remarks.“Anti-Semite? Check,” she wrote. “Misogynist? OF COURSE!! Racist? C’mon…”In a Nov. 30 op-ed for USA Today also deploring the tax bill, Disney wrote:“Although I was raised amid privilege and good fortune, I have always been cognizant of income and wealth inequality. It has never sat well with me.”To hear all of Disney’s comments about the tax bill, check out the full video above."

In perfect yuletide tradition, their spirits are rejuvenated by the end as they come together for an impromptu picnic on the beach.“Gay Christmas,” Goss explained on YouTube, is for those “who have felt like an outsider on what is supposed to be the happiest time of the year.”The singer, who originally hails from Wisconsin but lives in Los Angeles with his husband, told HuffPost that the song was inspired by his own decision not to head back to his hometown for the holidays this year. “Too many of us have had to learn to accept less from our families when it comes to fully embracing us for who we are,” he said in an email.The 2016 presidential election remains a divisive subject between him and his family, Goss added. He acknowledged feeling a “sense of betrayal” when he learned that some family members and close friends had voted for President Donald Trump, who ran on an explicitly anti-LGBTQ platform. “Yet we are expected to be the ones to forgive, to ‘move on’ and pretend everything is okay,” he said, “even as the current administration and GOP keep supporting anti-gay politicians and policies.” Goss, 36, is perhaps best known for his 2016 cover of “Son of a Preacher Man.” His music video reimagined the Dusty Springfield classic as a love story between two gay teens, one of whom happens to be the son of an evangelical preacher. The clip has racked up over 2 million views on YouTube.This year, Goss had already released two new videos, “More Than Temporary” and “Click,” both of which also featured LGBTQ-inclusive storylines. The singer, who has cited Dave Matthews, David Gray and Seal as musical influences, said he “absolutely” feels a responsibly to explore queer themes in his work. “The entertainment industry, as a whole, has ignored queer themes and stories,” he told HuffPost in 2016. “It’s my responsibility to work to transcend those boundaries, to tell these stories as accurately and authentically as I possibly can.” "

Times were tough for their mother, Shawn Ghant. She put up Graham for adoption when he was 3 months old.“At the time I felt like I could not give him what he needed,” she told WFAA.Though Vincent Ghant had vague memories of diapering his younger brother, his mother was hesitant to discuss it.“I asked my mother about him throughout my life, but the pain was so heavy on her that it was hard for her to drum up the words to explain it to me,” he told BuzzFeed. “So it just got to the point where I was, like, I’ll just wait for her when she’s ready.”Graham knew the first names of his biological mother, father and older brother Vincent. But he wasn’t able to connect the dots fully until a few weeks ago, when his adoptive parents gave him an ancestry DNA kit so he could find out more about his roots.“One day after school, I came home checked my email. I had an email the results were in,” Graham told “Inside Edition.” “I went through the names of people I was related to. I saw Vincent. I said, ‘I think that’s my birth brother.’”Graham found Ghant on Facebook and told him about the DNA results. “[I said] this is so random, I think I’m your birth brother,” Graham said.When he mentioned the name of his birth mother, Ghant knew Graham and he were indeed siblings.“When I realized it was him, I was shocked and then elated just to meet him again and talk to him,” Ghant told “Inside Edition.” “I was very amazed. I started thinking, ‘What if I passed him all these years and didn’t even know it?’ It was just fate that brought us together.”The two have since met in person, and Graham discovered he also has a 17-year-old brother, Christian Ghant. He documented the story on Twitter:Shawn Grant was happy that she was able to reunite with Graham.“Although it’s been 20 years, there’s not one day you don’t think about him,” she told Atlanta TV station WXIA.Graham’s adopted family plans to share Christmas with his biological family, making the present a true gift.“We have to catch up on a lot of missed times,” Ghant told Today.com."

Ryan’s efforts to defend the measure come amid one new poll showing only 24 percent of Americans think its a good idea. Attacks on the bill include that it benefits the wealthy, as opposed to the dwindling middle class, and that it will add an estimated $1.6 trillion to the government’s deficit.On ABC’s “Good Morning America” on Wednesday, Ryan rebuffed the criticism about the bill not helping the middle class. “I think minds are going to change and I think people are going to change their view on this,” he said.On the “Today” show, he told Guthrie that it isn’t possible to predict how the tax bill would affect the deficit.Guthrie referred to Ryan as a “longtime budget hawk,” and asked: “Are you saying that the growth you’re going to get from this tax cut will equal the amount it would cost on the deficit side so that it’s a wash, so that you’re not adding to the deficit at all because of this?” she asks.“Nobody knows the answer to that question because that’s in the future,” he said. “But what we do know, this will increase economic growth.”He went on to say that many Americans are “living paycheck to paycheck,” and that “another group of people in this country are about one check away from living paycheck to paycheck,” and the U.S. needs “faster economic growth so that people can get ahead.”“That’s what we’re doing,” Ryan said. “The average tax cut for the median family of four in America is going to be $2,059. $2,000, if you’re living paycheck to paycheck, is a serious tax cut.”Journalist Soledad O’Brien responded to Ryan’s comment with a tweet noting that “a family of four that gets a $1 million dollar tax cut and a family of four with zero tax cut has an ‘average’ of half a million in tax cuts.”Projecting deficits, meanwhile, is always a matter of looking into the future, so Ryan’s answer on the issue skirted the key question of the tax bill’s impact of the government’s red ink.Rep. Rod Blum (R-Iowa) told HuffPost in October that, “sadly, it doesn’t seem in [Washington] that people are very concerned about the debt or the deficit anymore.”Blum, though, has supported the tax bill. And as the clock runs down to the measure becoming law, it doesn’t seem as if Blum or Ryan are concerned either."

It was carrying 31 people, including 27 passengers traveling on two Royal Caribbean cruise ships, when the driver lost control in Quintana Roo state. Those two ships were Celebrity Equinox and Serenade of the Seas, the cruise line said. “Our hearts go out to all those involved in the bus accident,” Royal Caribbean spokeswoman Cynthia Martinez said in a statement. “We are doing all we can to care for our guests, including assisting with medical care and transportation.”Passenger Vítor Maciel Fontes Jacques, 32, told ABC News he was with his wife and five family members on the bus when it suddenly ran off the side of the road.“Then the driver pushed it over and it started flipping over,” Jacques said. “And then the bus flipped on its side.” He said the wreck left him with a broken clavicle, and his sister-in-law with a head injury that required surgery.Serenade of the Seas passenger Chris Brawley told the Sun Sentinel he was traveling on another bus to the same Mayan ruins when it came upon the wrecked vehicle, just minutes after it flipped.He described the two-lane road as narrow, with no shoulder or guardrail. The road was dry and there was no sign of any other vehicle being involved in the crash, he said.Last year, 11 tourists were killed in a crash, also in Quintana Roo, in which their bus flipped en route to Cancun, The Associated Press reported."

Despite its new legislation, France will continue to import and refine oil, Reuters reported.When the draft bill of the legislation was unveiled in September, French Environmental Minister Nicolas Hulot said he hoped it would inspire other countries to follow suit. He tweeted Tuesday that the law’s passage offered “proof that our generation can take care of future generations.”Under Macron’s administration, France has moved to more aggressively embrace renewable energy and take steps to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. In July, the country announced it would ban the sales of gas and diesel cars by 2040.The French president has tried to claim the mantle of global climate leadership that President Donald Trump abandoned after the United States pulled out of the Paris climate accord in June.To the ire of many Democratic lawmakers in the U.S. and environmental activists around the globe, Trump has sought to roll back Obama-era initiatives meant to combat global warming and ramp up domestic fossil fuel energy production, which includes reviving the rapidly declining U.S. coal industry."

If we can convince people to allow the women to be released to hospital without police going in with guns to do it, that’s probably OK. I mean, the police need to arrest perpetrators, but it’s not up to me to tell the police whom to arrest,” he said.Lutz had a personal stake, too, in helping the 6-year-old victim.The girl’s mother, Kepari Leniata, was burned alive in a public market in 2013, and Lutz helped organize the burial of her body afterward.He’s formed other sorrowful bonds too. Lutz sat beside a young mother named Shirley as she was dying after she was attacked on allegations of sorcery. “I drove back over the mountain and picked her up — it was about 15 hours of driving,” he said. “She was horrifically burned. It was another four or five days before she died of infections, but in that short amount of time, as a first responder type, you get emotionally bonded with the victim. “I’m caring for this young mother — she’s 25 years old — and she has burns all over her body and I’m trying to do everything I can to ensure she survives, and she dies.” Standing amid the woman’s community — with Shirley’s 2-year-old daughter and mother crying — Lutz asks himself why this happens. But he knows the answer. “Why does this little girl not have a mother? Because of some idiot men. It’s mind-boggling and heartbreaking,” he said.Lutz has said that between September and October there have been 30 attacks against women in Enga Province.PNG Tribal Foundation director Ruth Kissam says attacks would decline if people were arrested, prosecuted and convicted.“There is a steady rise because people know they can get away with this,” she said on Facebook. “It is gut-wrenchingly sickening and becoming hopeless now because all we — the [nongovernmental organizations] and churches — are doing is reactionary. We show up to repatriate if we’re lucky or bury the bodies if we’re late. We need coordinated response but that too is proving futile when police are not doing the arrests of the perpetrators.”Kissam believes the fear of sanguma can only be fought with collective action.“It’s a collective effort and unless this issue is addressed as an emergency, it has the cataclysmic power to destroy this country,” she said. A senior journalist at PNG television station EMTV, Scott Waide, recently told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. that the rise in sorcery accusations could be attributed to a decades-long breakdown in the country’s education system. “That … has contributed to this absence of critical thinking that this whole generation of Papua New Guineans now has,” he said in October. “There are a lot more people who will readily believe anything.”Most of PNG’s 8 million people live in areas with poor infrastructure amid almost impassable, rough terrain. This means there is little access to basic services, such as education, health or sanitation.Prime Minister Peter O’Neill has said the attacks cannot be tolerated and the abusers must be exposed.“Let’s be clear, sanguma beliefs are absolute rubbish,” O’Neill said in a statement. “In the modern day, sanguma is not a real cultural practice, it is false belief and involves the violent abuse and torture of women and girls by pathetic and perverted individuals. The men behind these murders are cowards who are looking for someone to blame because of their own failure in life.“These violent acts are against our values as a nation and are completely unacceptable.”The PNG government has launched a task force to investigate the situation and has reportedly planned $4 million in funding in next year’s budget for education and awareness programs.

The bill, which passed by unanimous vote, will not affect permanent circuses.Scotland’s environment secretary, Roseanna Cunningham, proposed the bill after a government survey found that over 95 percent of respondents favored taking action to protect wild animals. Though there aren’t currently any traveling circuses in Scotland that use wild animals, Cunningham introduced the legislation on “ethical” grounds, the BBC reported.“This is an important act that will not only prevent traveling circuses ever showing wild animals in Scotland in the future, but will demonstrate to the wider world that we are one of the growing number of countries that no longer condones the use of wild animals in this way,” Cunningham said on Wednesday, according to The Guardian.Animal rights organizations applauded the bill’s passage.“Captivity is a living hell for animals such as tigers and lions, and a circus environment can’t possibly meet their complex needs.” wrote the U.K. branch of animal advocacy group PETA in a statement.“These animals understandably become frustrated, stressed, and depressed from a lifetime of being denied everything that’s natural and important to them, kept caged in trailers that are hauled around the country, and forced to perform confusing tricks under the big top for some Victorian-era sense of entertainment.”Animal Defenders International congratulated Scotland on being the first nation in the United Kingdom to take such a stand for the welfare of wild animals.“Given the constant travel and their temporary nature, circuses cannot provide animals with adequate facilities to keep them physically or psychologically healthy. Welfare is inevitably compromised,” the group wrote in a statement.Traveling circuses frequently use exotic and wild animals, including lions, elephants, bears and camels, in their performances. Many countries around the globe have proposed or passed legislation to end the practice, citing animal and public safety concerns.Partially in response to public pressure, a number of circuses elsewhere have chosen to close down animal acts, including the famed Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, which ended its use of elephants in 2016 before closing for good earlier this year."

A prominent delegation, featuring such dignitaries as former Pakistani High Commissioner Wajid Shamsul Hasan, joined for the celebration.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a3a826a1600002700cf2417.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It is perhaps one of the great ironies of Pakistan that the founder of the nation spent his first and final Christmas in a church with the Christian community to express his support for the minorities.Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the Quaid-i-Azam, was committed to ensuring that the minorities of Pakistan were fully included as citizens and treated as equals. In a speech he gave in August 1947 to the Constituent Assembly, the Quaid famously remarked, “You are free; you are free to go to your temples, you are free to go to your mosques or to any other place of worship in this State of Pakistan ... You may belong to any religion or caste or creed ― that has nothing to do with the business of the State.”It is ironic then that on Sunday, Dec. 17, just over a week prior to Christmas, the day when Christians celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ and the same day Pakistanis celebrate the birth of the Quaid, two suicide bombers attacked a crowded church in Quetta, killing nine and injuring at least 55.I have found this attack to be particularly shocking, as I served as commissioner in Quetta in the late 1980s and was thus in charge of law and order in the division. My role then was to protect citizens of all faiths. The idea of a church or any member of a minority community being attacked so blatantly is shocking to me and breaks my heart. As the Quaid expressed, it is the duty of every Pakistani to safeguard all citizens, but especially the vulnerable, like the minorities. I am sorry to see this vision being decimated before our very eyes.Pakistanis must stop killing Christians. Pakistan as a country claims to honor the message of the Quaid and revere his founding of the nation. Yet Pakistani Christians keep being brutally attacked. In March 2015, twin bombings at two churches in Lahore killed at least 15. Last year, a bombing in a crowded Lahore park on Easter Sunday killed 75. The Quetta attack is a new low though for Pakistan. Could there be a worse insult to the legacy of the Quaid than that of a church bombing in the heart of Advent, one week before the treasured Christmas holiday and his very own birthday?What is encouraging is that this time around, in a shift in the national tone, many prominent Pakistani leaders roundly and swiftly condemned what happened in Quetta. To cite some examples from the many at hand:Councillor Dr James Shera MBE, S.Pk, the former Mayor of Rugby, England, and a prominent Pakistani Christian, stated in response, “I am deeply saddened and shocked to hear of the suicide attack in Quetta Methodist church with nine killed and over 50 injured. My deepest sympathies for the families of the injured and whose loved ones lost their lives. May God bless the souls of the innocent people who gave their lives. I wholeheartedly praise the security services for their brave act which stopped harm to many more people who were inside the church. Pakistan is going through various challenges and trials and tribulations where the enemy of state is determined to divide us under the name of religion or ethnic background. We must fight together against this evil and not let them succeed to dent the good name of our country and its people. I appeal to all Pakistanis from ordinary to good and great to unite together and resurrect the Quaid’s Pakistan which is based on equality, justice and freedom for all faiths to practice their faith without fear. We must bring a radical reform and not allow extremism in any shape or form to flourish and weaken Pakistan. God save Pakistan.”The Pakistan High Commissioner to the UK and Ireland, Syed Ibne Abbas, wrote to James Shera in the aftermath of the attack expressing his condolences to the community: “James Sahib, Terror attack on a congregation at a Church in Quetta is truly appalling. This cowardly act, especially during the Festive season, is heartbreaking. This is our collective loss. Our heart goes out to the families of victims. These beasts who target places of worship are against humanity.”Dr. Amineh Hoti, who works tirelessly within Pakistan and beyond to build bridges between the faith communities, heartily condemned the attacks: “This mean act of killing people intentionally during Christmas is a heinous act against humanity, against the Abrahamic faiths, and against what the flag of Pakistan stands for. During these cold winter nights when the poor and wounded do not have enough, we need to reach out, heal and pray. May God give human beings the sense and wisdom to love, empathize and reach out to all human beings regardless of their religious and ethnic differences. Amin.”International voices committed to promoting dialogue among faiths and cultures are also reacting strongly to these heinous attacks. Patrick Burnett, a young Catholic American working to build bridges between faith communities in the US and abroad, anguished in response to the church bombing: “It breaks my heart that on the third Sunday of Advent, when we in the Christian faith are preparing to celebrate Christmas, a season of both great joy and deep reflection, dozens of innocent Pakistani Christians are killed and injured just for celebrating their faith. The Quaid would be deeply angered and heartbroken to witness this fundamental challenge to his expansive and inclusive vision for Pakistan. Building bridges of understanding and compassion between our faith communities could not be more important and urgent than in this global crisis of pluralism.”On a note which inspires hope for the nation, in response to the attack in Quetta, the Regional Police Officer in Gujranwala, Ashfaq A. Khan, visited a number of the city’s churches to ensure their security infrastructure and procedures were properly in place before the Christmas holiday. He also instructed all his police officers to ensure the full protection of the Christian community during their Christmas celebrations. And alongside the deputy commissioners, Mr. Khan broke bread and shared cake in the churches with the Christian community to ensure the strengthening of ties between the community and the administration.If more Pakistanis work to follow the examples set by the Quaid, as reflected by the administration in Gujranwala, I am confident we can defeat the scourge that was on full display in Quetta this past weekend. We must all make a concerted effort to heal these wounds and close the gaps between our faiths, before more innocent lives are lost and before the vision of Pakistan is lost. We have two choices in Pakistan ― support and protect the minorities in the spirit of the Quaid or watch the nation disintegrate before our very eyes. It gives me hope that so many Pakistanis are responding so passionately and swiftly to the Quaid’s vision."

Republicans will be eager to get him confirmed and on the job. Considering Azar’s background, they have good reason to believe he’ll be a reliable ally when they get to work on their next big goal: slashing spending on health care programs, Medicare in particular. If confirmed, Azar will be the first pharmaceutical industry executive to head HHS. During his tenure at Eli Lilly & Company, he oversaw big increases in the price of a number of the company’s drugs. But his corporate job is not the only reason to expect he’ll listen more to industry lobbyists than patient and consumer rights advocates. For other hints, we need to look at his past roles at influential lobbying and PR groups that represent not only drug makers but insurance companies, hospitals, medical device manufacturers and other big companies. Azar served for several years as a member of the board of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO), the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) and the Healthcare Leadership Council (HLC). All three exist to protect and enhance what has become a very profitable status quo for their members. In my former job as a health insurance executive, I worked closely with both NAM and the HLC when lawmakers in Washington were considering proposals that the groups feared might affect the profits of member companies in some adverse way.The insurance industry often called on NAM to disseminate talking points that would have been perceived as self-serving, and rightly so, if they came directly from insurers. NAM was a willing ally because of a shared belief that any new regulations, whether affecting insurers or manufacturers, should be opposed—unless, of course, a proposed regulatory change would benefit the corporations they represented.It is Azar’s role at the Healthcare Leadership Council, however, that perhaps indicates who Azar would side with on an issue in which consumers and big businesses are on opposite sides. He was a member of the HLC’s board of directors from 2008 until this past January. He also served as the group’s treasurer. You can be certain the HLC’s member companies—and their shareholders—couldn’t be happier with his nomination.Although the HLC has been around since 1988, it is relatively obscure outside of a few important circles in the political and policymaking arenas. That is by design. It exists to influence lawmakers. The organization said this of itself a few years ago: “Because of the broad scope of the HLC membership, (we are) well known by congressional members and staff as an integral source for comprehensive information on health care issues.”Indeed, the HLC’s membership includes many of the country’s biggest drug and medical device manufacturers, hospitals and health insurers. The dues they pay enable the organization to mount aggressive PR and lobbying campaigns in opposition to—or in favor of—proposed health care reform initiatives. In my previous career, I was involved in several HLC campaigns, starting with the successful effort in 1993 and 1994 to keep the Clinton health care reform plan from being enacted.In a post mortem of the ill-fated Clinton plan, The National Journal reported that the HLC had mounted a multipronged attack that included grassroots organizing, lobbying by corporate chief executives and other public relations efforts. As part of its campaign, the organization also ran ads in key congressional districts across the country that raised the specter of health care rationing and warned of bureaucratic interference with patients’ rights.The HLC has been equally effective in getting Congress to enact reforms its member companies support. One of its long-term goals is the privatization of the Medicare program. In 1995, the HLC embarked on a campaign it called “Rescuing Medicare.” As part of that campaign, it disseminated a document on Capitol Hill that claimed private insurers operated much more efficiently than Medicare. “Medicare is in dire financial straits,” the document warned. “If changes are not made, Medicare will be bankrupt in seven years.”Another HLC document from that time, distributed to member companies, provided an overview of the organization’s Medicare reform strategy:The HLC has spent the last two and a half years developing a communications network that is second to none in energizing activists committed to market-based health care reform. The network includes grassroots, media, and written material preparation and distribution components, as well as mechanisms for planning special events, monitoring and reporting on the ongoing debate, building coalitions with other groups, and scheduling and preparing speakers. The HLC stands ready to duplicate last year’s successful fight against price controls and government-dominated medicine by mobilizing teams around the country in support of Medicare reform.The reform the HLC advocated—which it called “the cure”—was the replacement of the traditional Medicare program with something resembling the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. Under the FEHB, government workers choose from a list of private insurers (with no government-run plan—no “public option” like Medicare— available). The HLC proposed that Medicare beneficiaries be given a certain amount of money every year that they use to pay premiums to private insurance plans.Although Medicare has not yet been privatized as the HLC envisioned, the organization’ efforts have borne fruit. Today’s Medicare Advantage (MA) program, the private insurance alternative to traditional Medicare, exists to a large extent because of the HLC’s effective PR and lobbying campaigns. Almost a third of Medicare-eligible beneficiaries are now enrolled in a private MA plan. The HLC also played a role, along with lobbyists for pharmaceutical and health insurance companies, in shaping the legislation that created Medicare Part D, the prescription drug program. Under that legislation, the federal government is prohibited from negotiating directly with drug company for lower prices. Don’t expect that prohibition to go away during Azar’s tenure. Drug companies and insurers have made huge profits because of it.During most years, Congressional Republicans rail against the government’s growing debt. Not this year, of course, because the GOP tax bill will cause it to grow by leaps and bounds over the coming years. You can expect their concern about deficit spending—and determination to do something it—will return next year. House Speaker Paul Ryan said earlier this month that he and his Republican colleagues will try to take an ax to Medicare and other health care and anti-poverty programs next year.Ryan has long advocated for privatizing Medicare, an HLC goal for decades, which he claims would save taxpayers money. He has reason to believe Azar will be in his corner—and that he can count on the HLC to help out with an aggressive PR and lobbying campaign."

32,POLITICS,Democrats Split Over Opposing Government Funding Bill That Doesn't Protect Dreamers,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dick-durbin-dreamers_us_5a399129e4b06d1621b04241,Sen. Dick Durbin said “most” of his colleagues agree the bill must have Dreamer protections. But the GOP only needs a few to break away -- and some already have.,2017-12-20,Senate Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) speaks as Senate Minority Whip Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) listens during a news briefing on Sept. 19.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a3991ce1600005f46cf2269.jpeg?cache=z0PzTZQkn3&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said Tuesday that he will vote against a government spending bill this week if it doesn’t include protections for young undocumented immigrants, and that he believes “most” of his colleagues are with him. But Democrats aren’t united on whether they are willing to risk a government shutdown over those immigrants, who are known as Dreamers. Republicans, who control the White House and both chambers of Congress, only need a few Democrats to break with Durbin in order to pass a government spending bill without Dreamer protections, and several have said they would. And Durbin wouldn’t commit to whipping — D.C.-speak for formally urging — fellow Democrats to join him in opposing a spending bill that doesn’t protect Dreamers.“Don’t have to,” Durbin told HuffPost when asked if he’d whip against a spending bill without Dreamer protections. “Believe me. Everybody has pretty intense personal feelings about this.”Congress has until Friday to pass a funding bill and avoid a government shutdown.If Democrats can’t unite, Dreamers could be left without good options. Immigration reform advocates think this week is their best shot to get legal status for nearly 700,000 Dreamers who are at risk of losing deportation protections and work permits ― or who have lost them already ― because President Donald Trump ended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. Republicans have previously blocked immigration reform, and party leaders say they don’t want to include Dreamer protections in the must-pass spending bill. But because some House conservatives routinely oppose government funding measures and Republicans don’t have a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, Republicans will need some Democratic votes to avoid a government shutdown. Democrats have some leverage — they’re just not united on whether and when to use it. The biggest question is whether it’s acceptable to let the fight over Dreamers extend to next year, particularly if Republican leaders push for a short-term government funding extension that would give Democrats another chance for leverage later. Durbin told reporters that he would vote against even a short-term spending bill and that he thinks “most [Senate Democrats] might agree with my position.”Senate Republicans would only need some Democrats to join them to fund the government, however, and several ― including Sens. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), according to The Washington Post ― have said they would be unwilling to risk a shutdown over Dreamers. There “may be” division on that point between Durbin and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Durbin said. Schumer told reporters on Tuesday that he is “very hopeful that we can get the Dream bill in the end-of-the-year CR,” referring to the continuing resolution spending deal. He did not give a yes or no answer when asked whether he’d support a package that left out Dreamer provisions. “I’m hopeful we won’t get to that,” Schumer said during a press conference. “I’m hopeful that they will put [a] bipartisan proposal with both Dream and border security in the bill.” Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) ― who, along with Durbin, is negotiating with several Republicans on a Dreamer bill deal ― similarly declined to give a firm answer to how he would vote if a spending bill did not include Dreamer protections. “I hope that’s not our choice,” he told reporters. “I think we should do it before we leave.” Several Democratic senators have made public promises to oppose a spending bill if Dreamers are left out, or to press for action by the end of the year. Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) each tweeted this week that they would oppose a hypothetical deal without Dreamer protections. Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) appeared with Durbin and Dreamers at a press conference on Tuesday morning to pledge their support.“If Republicans refuse to do the right thing and protect Dreamers in the upcoming long-term spending bill, then they are going to cause the government to shut down,” Gillibrand said. “Because I am not going to vote for any long-term spending bill that doesn’t protect our Dreamers, period.” Booker said Congress “should not go home for Christmas until we solve this problem.” “The only way to morally pass an extension, the only way we can go home is by passing a Dream Act,” Blumenthal said.And Harris said there’s no time to waste, noting that an estimated 122 DACA recipients have lost protections every day since Trump rescinded the program. “Each day matters,” she said. “And for that reason, we must get this done, and we must get it done before the end of this year ― no January, no February, no March. Now.”That sense of urgency is what immigration reform advocates are trying to get across to lawmakers, with mixed success. When Trump rescinded DACA, he said was giving Congress six months to act, because his administration allowed recipients whose protections expired up until March 5 a brief window to renew them. If Congress does nothing, nearly 1,000 DACA recipients per day will lose their work permits and be put at risk of deportation starting March 6. Immigration reform advocates have pointed out that others who missed the renewal deadline are already in peril. Some Republicans in the House have agreed that the situation is urgent ― 34 of them wrote to House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) earlier this month to call for a solution by the end of the year. Reps. Carlos Curbelo and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida have both said they would vote against a spending bill if it doesn’t include help for Dreamers. But in the Senate, even Republicans who support a fix have said it can wait until next year. Durbin said negotiations with Senate Republicans were both “fair and slow.”“I think they need to share our sense of urgency,” he said. Dreamers certainly do. Greisa Martinez, advocacy and policy director for the group United We Dream, said at the press conference with senators that “there is no time to wait” because people are already at risk. “We have three more days left,” she said. “We demand results from Democrats and Republicans, and for those that looked at us in the face and made us promises to keep them.” "

Al Franken (D-Minn.) to resign amid sexual misconduct allegations.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a3ab811150000490049cc97.jpeg?cache=dMEnFdxV71&ops=crop_0_74_3000_1819%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"The head of the Democratic National Committee said Wednesday that it’s perfectly appropriate for the party to continue to remind people of the sexual misconduct allegations against President Donald Trump, and there should be an investigation into his conduct. “If the tables had been turned, and it were a Democratic president accused of this and a Republican Congress, you’d have 18 different special investigations going on right now. It’d be the only thing they’d be doing,” DNC chairman Tom Perez said in an interview with HuffPost.He also stressed that he has “repeatedly” said that those involved in sexual misconduct “should step down.”“I’ve said that about Democrats, and I’ve said that about Republicans,” Perez added. “And I’ve said that about the occupant of the Oval Office.”He acknowledged, however, that it’s unlikely Trump will heed his resignation call. “I was born at night, but I wasn’t born last night,” Perez said.Twenty-one women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct, including assault. Although the president has denied the allegations, they have gained renewed attention in recent weeks as other powerful men, including members of Congress, have been forced to give up their jobs over misconduct charges.More than 100 House members, as well as a handful of senators ― all Democrats ― have called on Trump to leave office or be investigated over the charges. “President Trump should resign,” Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) recently said. “These allegations are credible; they are numerous. I’ve heard these women’s testimony, and many of them are heartbreaking.Other Democrats, however, have demurred from such comments. Doug Jones, the newly elected Democratic senator from Alabama, said he believes it’s detrimental for the party to focus on the allegations. ″People had an opportunity to judge before” last year’s presidential election, Jones said on CNN on Sunday. “I think we need to move on and not get distracted by those issues.”“I don’t think the president ought to resign at this point,” he continued. “We’ll see how things go.”Perez said Wednesday that he disagreed. “We’ve been very clear at the DNC that the issue of sexual assault, harassment and sexual misconduct, it transcends party,” he said. “Whether it’s a Democrat or a Republican, whether you’re in the House or the Senate, whether you’re in a corporate board room or you’re on the factory floor or you’re in the Oval Office.”Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) announced earlier this month that he would resign soon amid mounting allegations of unwanted groping and other sexual misconduct. Reps. John Conyers (D-Mich.) and Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) each gave up their seats this month in the face of sexual misconduct allegations.Some Democratic senators have subsequently argued that the drumbeat for Franken’s resignation was premature. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who refused to join his colleagues in calling for Franken’s departure, told Politico that the pressure on the Minnesotan from his fellow Democrats to step down was “atrocious.” He called on Franken to withdraw his resignation pending the results of an Ethics Committee investigation. Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) said on Monday that he regretted calling on Franken to resign, arguing that his colleague was entitled to the “due process” of an Ethics Committee inquiry.Addressing such concerns, Perez said that when the congressional process for addressing sexual misconduct allegations “doesn’t work very well, it doesn’t give you a lot of confidence.”“The chronic slowness of the process, and the chronic secrecy of the process had the effect of enabling rather than preventing misconduct,” he said.Perez was among the leading Democrats who called on Franken to resign. He told HuffPost on Wednesday that he still believes he made the right decision. “Yeah,” he said. “Absolutely.” "

Federal funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which is jointly run and financed by the federal government and the states, expired nearly two months ago. The program covers about 9 million children in the U.S.But the GOP-controlled Congress, which made time to pass a sweeping tax bill that largely benefits corporations and the rich, didn’t get around to reauthorizing CHIP ― and now millions of children are in jeopardy. States are rapidly running out of money to pay these children’s medical bills, and several have started notifying parents that their kids’ health care is poised to disappear. At least 14 states plan to terminate CHIP by the end of January, according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.Andrew Montoya, 35, of Longmont, Colorado, got a letter from the state government last month notifying him that his three daughters ― Audrey, 8, Katrina, 5, and Scarlett, 3 ― might wind up uninsured because of Congress’ inaction. “They need to stop playing politics with our kids,” said Montoya, an attorney at an organization that provides assistance to people with disabilities. Montoya and his wife, Nicole, were both uninsured for most of their lives before the Affordable Care Act became law and they qualified for tax credits to reduce their monthly premiums. CHIP is called Child Health Plan Plus in Colorado.“We qualify because my income working as an attorney for a nonprofit organization is not very high,” Montoya said. He ran the numbers and discovered that adding his daughters to his health insurance policy would increase the cost by $450 to $650 a month, which he can’t afford on his salary. Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper (D) has asked the state legislature to fund CHIP until Congress acts.State officials are scrambling to figure out what to do, but are mostly powerless unless Congress does something. Twenty-five states are due to run out of money in January, and nine more during February, according to the Center for Children and Families. That puts health coverage for 1.9 million kids at risk next month and 2.9 million through February.“We are in a terrible situation right now,” Linda Nablo, the chief deputy director of the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services, said during a conference call with reporters hosted by the Center for Children and Families. “We are certainly running numbers and trying to analyze options.”“All this, of course, is being done as the holiday season approaches,” she said. “It’s left us in a terrible quandary. I’m not really sure what we’re going to say to parents or what the solution is going to be.”Virginia will have to shut down CHIP, known in the state as Family Access to Medical Insurance Security, at some point next month because the program is very nearly out of money, Nablo said. “There’s no good options here.”Virginia originally told parents that their kids’ CHIP benefits would be in place through the end of January. Congress enacted legislation last month allowing the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to reallocate unspent CHIP money between the states ― but Virginia wound up on the losing end of the deal and has less funding than it expected, Nablo said.Alabama already announced that it’s freezing enrollment in its CHIP, called Alabama ALL Kids, as of Jan. 1, and that the program will shut down completely at the end of next month. Connecticut also is freezing enrollment this Saturday and will close down CHIP, known there as the HUSKY Program, on Jan. 31.“Our phones are ringing off the wall,” Cathy Caldwell, the director of the Alabama Bureau of Children’s Health Insurance Programs, said during the conference call. “We have panicked families just wondering what in the world they have as options, so it is very, very stressful here in Alabama.”Virginia is urging parents to squeeze in whatever medical care they can before the coverage goes away, Nablo said.“We suggested to families that if your children needed a doctor visit or a dental visit, they might want to arrange that in the month of January,” she said. “And we’re particularly concerned about families with children in the course of treatment or who are very, very sick, potentially even hospitalized.”The situation differs among the states, depending on how they established their versions of CHIP. States that created standalone children’s health programs are most at risk, because they don’t have the money themselves to keep them running and don’t have another way to cover those children, Joan Alker, executive director of the Center for Children and Families, told HuffPost.Those states could change their Medicaid laws to allow those kids into that program instead, but that would take too long to prevent a lapse in coverage, Alker said. And while many of those children are in families that qualify for subsidized private insurance from the Affordable Care Act’s exchanges, those policies are costlier than CHIP and have more meager benefits, she said.“There’s a few different ways children could end up going, all of them worse than where they currently are in CHIP,” Alker said.States that set up CHIP as an offshoot of their Medicaid programs are in a different bind. Federal law requires those states to maintain coverage for children, so these states would have to move all their CHIP kids into Medicaid, Alker said. But the federal government pays a much larger share of CHIP expenses than it does for Medicaid, so states would have to somehow find new money, she said.Republicans say they’ll act on CHIP when they return to Washington next month, which would be cutting it very close. And given the dysfunction seen in Congress this year, there’s reason to doubt Congress can pass a bill in time to save the states and the kids on CHIP.There’s no actual dispute in Congress that CHIP should be reauthorized. The House even passed a bill to do so last month. Democrats opposed the legislation in large part because it would fund the CHIP renewal by rolling back elements of the Affordable Care Act. That didn’t matter in the House, where Republicans have a large majority. But in the Senate ― where a CHIP bill made it through committee in October without including any means to pay for it ― reauthorizing the program would require 60 votes, and Republicans have just 52. “This is a game of chicken,” said T.C. Bell, 30, who lives in Denver. “My kids are just being put in the middle of that.”Bell is a full-time student with a very low income. He qualifies for Medicaid, known there as Health First Colorado. His daughters, 8-year-old Dagny and 5-year-old Emma, are covered by CHIP.“I have no option. My income is so small, I can barely keep a roof over my family’s head,” Bell said. As a child, he lacked health insurance; he doesn’t want his daughters to have to scrounge for medical care, as his family did. “It’s kind of like going back to the shadows of health care.”CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated Andrew Montoya’s age."

(We stopped asking after Stewart, meaning the percentage of the House GOP conference who knew this key aspect of the bill could have been much worse than our imperfect survey suggests.)To be clear, we were just looking for seven figures: 10 percent, 12 percent, 22 percent, 24 percent, 32 percent, 35 percent and 37 percent. We were not looking for congressional representatives to display some savant-like ability and provide the income thresholds for each bracket. We just wanted to see if Republicans knew this one simple element of a bill they were rushing into law.They didn’t.Among the GOP lawmakers who were shaky on those specifics were members of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, the chairwoman of the House Budget Committee (Rep. Diane Black of Tennessee) and the lead author of the bill in the House (Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady of Texas).“So the seven brackets?” Brady said when we asked him. “So you got them right there. I’m heading to the floor and finishing my remarks on this tax cut and reform jobs act, so thank you.”When we pressed Brady again to name the brackets, he dismissed the question. “So please, please. Seriously? I would like to finish my job,” he said.Even though Brady almost certainly should know the brackets in a tax bill he is authoring, the Ways and Means chairman was in good company.We repeatedly asked Budget Chairwoman Black, who repeatedly claimed she knew the brackets, but would not say them. At one point during our impromptu interview, an aide started a conversation in the elevator so the congresswoman could avoid the question. And then Black left the elevator for the House floor; we trailed behind still asking for the brackets with Black still saying she knew them without providing any proof.As the head of the Budget Committee, Black oversaw the budget vehicle that allowed Republicans to pass the tax bill through a special legislative process without any Democratic support.A number of House Republicans eventually admitted they didn’t know the brackets “off the top of my head.” Those were the words of Rep. David McKinley (R-W.Va.). And Rep. Bradley Byrne (R-Ala.). And Chuck Fleischmann (R-Tenn.).Other Republicans tried their best to squirm away from the question. Rep. Jackie Walorski (R-Ind.) claimed she knew the brackets, but wouldn’t list them when we repeatedly asked. Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) said he could probably answer the question, but, loosely summoning Albert Einstein, added, “Why remember what you can write down?” And Rep. Billy Long (R-Mo.), who was happy to tell us that Republicans were getting more familiar with the bill, went mute after we asked about the brackets.Still other Republican representatives tried their best to guess the brackets, including Roger Williams (R-Texas), Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) and Chris Collins (R-N.Y.).Gallagher and Cramer were close, but each left out one or two.Asking those members of Congress to name the seven tax brackets was, of course, a gotcha question. It was also an entirely fair question ― listen to our interviews below and you can hear that the lawmakers knew they were supposed to know. Republicans began their quest for tax reform by promising a simpler tax code ― one with fewer brackets, even though the relationship between brackets and simplicity is tenuous at best. Still, by their own words, reducing the number of brackets was a key goal. And the bill would be slightly easier to comprehend if there were fewer brackets ― which there aren’t ― although it still wouldn’t really be easier to file your taxes.Part of the reason House Republicans were so unfamiliar with the numbers was because House Republicans ended up swallowing the Senate’s tax bracket proposal, along with a number of deductions that the House eliminated but the Senate kept. (That also undermined the House GOP’s claims about simplicity.) While the final bill was supposed to be a compromise, Senate Republicans clearly won some key battles, including on the individual tax brackets, so it’s at least a little understandable that House Republicans weren’t as familiar with those details.But that wasn’t the excuse we got from the lawmakers themselves.House Republicans told us, time and again, that they were “very familiar” with the details of this legislation. When we suggested they didn’t have much time to read the final legislation after it was released Friday night, they said they had plenty of time. “We’ve had several weeks! I read it on the plane two weeks in a row!” Rep. Jeff Denham (R-Calif.) told HuffPost.But how much should we trust that if, in the next breath, those lawmakers didn’t know basic facts about the bill?The individual tax brackets aren’t inconsequential; they just weren’t what Republicans were truly focused on. If you were to ask any House Republican what the new corporate tax rate will be, they almost certainly would have been able to tell you it’s 21 percent. If you asked them the top individual rate only, they likely would have been able to tell you it was 37 percent. Many members, in fact, were able to list the top bracket, which, as every member also likely knows, has been lowered from 39.6 percent.The rates in the middle, however, the rates that actually apply to the middle class ― the people Republicans kept saying the bill was aimed to help ― were not numbers the lawmakers knew. At least not specifically. They didn’t appear to have studied where individual rates were previously and where they’re going to be at various income levels ― or if they did, they didn’t study very hard.GOP lawmakers were far more focused on corporate rates and the tax rates on higher incomes that affect them personally.As Roger Williams ― who has an estimated worth between $20 million and $70 million ― said about the individual tax rate, “I know what mine’s going to be.”But Republicans truly want you to believe they know the ins and outs of this legislation.When we asked Rep. Ralph Abraham (R-La.) how familiar Republicans were with this bill, he said Republicans were “as well-versed on this tax cut bill as any other bill as we’ve ever voted on.”And then, when we pressed Abraham to name the brackets, he listed 10 percent, 12 percent, 14 percent, 16 percent, 22 percent, 28 percent ... and trailed off. That’s three right out of seven.You can listen to the interviews of each member we asked here:Kevin Brady (R-Texas)Diane Black (R-Tenn.)Roger Williams (R-Texas)Tom McClintock (R-Calif.)David McKinley (R-W.Va.)Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.)Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.)Bradley Byrne (R-Ala.)Lynn Jenkins (R-Kan.)Bill Johnson (R-Ohio)Chris Collins (R-N.Y.)Jeff Denham (R-Calif.)Chuck Fleischmann (R-Tenn.)Jackie Walorski (R-Ind.)Billy Long (R-Mo.)Ralph Abraham (R-La.)Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.)And here’s the successful attempt by Chris Stewart (R-Utah) at naming the brackets."

Or flipping a coin...,2017-12-20,"Republican David Yancey and Democrat Shelly Simonds attend a ""take your legislator to school day"" at Heritage High School in Newport News, Virginia, on on Nov. 28.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a3a9058160000783ecf2476.jpeg?cache=cTdvEeLd5q&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A three-judge panel in Virginia decided Wednesday to count a ballot cast for a Republican in a race for the state’s House of Delegates that was decided by just one vote, meaning the contest is now a tie.A recount completed Tuesday determined Democrat Shelly Simonds had defeated Republican incumbent David Yancey by just one vote. The race is being closely watched because control of the Virginia House of Delegates hinges on its outcome.Judges on the Newport News Circuit Court determined Wednesday that a ballot on which the voter had marked the bubbles for both Yancey and Simonds, and then tried to clarify which one, should have been counted for Yancey rather than discarded during the recount. The ballot in question apparently had marks for Yancey and Simonds, with a strike through Simonds’ name. The voter had also put a strike through their vote for Ed Gillespie, the Republican candidate for governor. According to a provision in a Virginia law, a general assembly race that results in a tie is decided by the state Board of Elections determining a winner “by lot” ― meaning the winner is selected through a process like picking names out of a hat, drawing straws or flipping a coin. This means that control of the House of Delegates could hinge on a process that leaves the outcome up to chance.If Simonds wins, the House of Delegates will be split 50-50 between Republicans and Democrats. If Yancey wins, Republicans will have a 51-49 majority in the chamber.Speaking to reporters after the decision, Yancey declined to comment on the possibility of a coin toss, saying he was focused on Wednesday’s results and serving the people of his district. He said his understanding was that the Virginia Board of Elections would determine what happened next.Republicans have controlled the Virginia House of Delegates for 17 years.Marc Elias, an attorney for the Virginia Democratic Party, said in a statement that the court’s ruling was incorrect.“Today’s decision by the court was wrong, and Delegate-elect Shelly Simonds should have been certified the winner. We are currently assessing all legal options before us as we fight for a just result,” Elias said. “The Republicans themselves had affirmed that this result was accurate yesterday before changing their minds today. After conceding this seat and their majority, they are now desperately trying to claw both back ‘like a snarling dog that won’t let go of a bone.’”"

The company left personal information describing 123 million U.S. households exposed.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a398dde160000783ecf225c.jpeg?ops=crop_0_88_5760_3445%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"You’ve probably never heard of them, but chances are good they know plenty about you ― including things like your home address, your phone number, your sports interests and whether you’re a “dog enthusiast.”“They” are an online marketing and analytics firm by the name of Alteryx, and according to a report Tuesday by the cyber risk company UpGuard, they left a database containing sensitive information on 123 million American households unsecured and open to the public.Chris Vickery, UpGuard’s cyber risk research director, told HuffPost Tuesday he stumbled across the 36-gigabyte database during a routine search of Amazon Web Services’ storage “buckets,” which house data for various companies of all sizes. Anyone with a basic understanding of what keywords to look for and how to sift through vast amounts of data could have done the same, Vickery said.“I’m not the only person doing this,” he said. “I’m certain there are bad guys doing it as well as good guys.”As for the data itself: The file contains 123 million rows of data, one for just about every single household in the U.S. at the time of its likely creation in 2013. And each of those households is individually described via 248 specific categories.In addition to the data listed above (address, phone number, whether you’re a dog or cat person, etc.), other categories include the number of children living in the house, and their age ranges and gender; what types of magazines you subscribe to; your mortgage amount; how old your car is; which causes you donate to; your ethnicity; and plenty more.While the database doesn’t include individual names, Vickery said that’s a moot point given everything else it contains.“It gets down to a level specific enough to be dangerous, although it does not have first [and] last names,” he said. “It’s so simple to look up somebody’s name if you have their address and their phone number.”Given its personal nature, that information could be used for pretty damaging purposes, like circumventing what’s known as “knowledge-based authentication.”“When you buy a car these days, or you apply for a loan, or you’re going for a student loan with the government or something, in order to verify who you are, a lot of times you run into knowledge-based authentication,” Vickery explained. “That’s where not only do you have to provide your name, address and Social Security number, but they’ll also ask you, ‘OK, where did you live five years ago, who owns the mortgage to your house’ ― all sorts of bits of data that only you are supposed to know.”“Databases like this allow bad guys to have that information about large swaths of people,” he said. “So lots of fraud can be committed, even with systems that are designed to be based on personal knowledge.”A central component of Alteryx’s database, titled “ConsumerView,” was provided by a company you probably have heard of: Experian. Experian has a database with that exact name that Alteryx incorporates into a license it sells for $38,995 a year.Reached for comment, Experian directed HuffPost to Alteryx. Alteryx didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.“This is an Alteryx issue,” Experian said in a statement, noting that the data in question is used often in marketing. “Data security has always been, and always will be, our highest priority. As a matter of security best practices, Experian vets all our clients and mandates robust security measures and controls to secure our data.”To be clear, Experian isn’t responsible for this particular data breach, though it’s certainly not a stranger to data breaches in general. Experian supplied the data to Alteryx, and Alteryx failed to secure it. (Similarly, Alteryx likely wasn’t at fault for a separate data breach earlier this year that exposed the personal information of almost all of America’s 200 million registered voters. The database in that instance was stored as an Alteryx file type, suggesting it originated with the company, but the blame rests with the Republican data firm that left it open to the public.)Regardless of who is at fault in this particular circumstance, Vickery said all the companies that compile this type of data need to up their security game.“I’m a little disappointed that [Alteryx] would just leave it unencrypted out there for anybody, and that Experian would just give them a copy like that,” he said. “Keeping it open and in the clear is just asking for trouble.”As for the consumers affected by this breach ― which, again, is pretty much every American household ― there isn’t much we can do except push for stronger regulations on the companies that compile this type of data.“If you’re an American, your information probably was exposed,” Vickery said. “We live in a new age,” he added. “You have to stay vigilant. You have to watch your financial accounts. You can’t just assume you’re not going to be a victim, because the bad guys have the knowledge, the information and the tools these days.”“It’s more a question of whether or not you’re lucky rather than how protective you’ve been,” he said. “Even if you’ve been very protective of your information, there’s companies like Equifax that have your data. And even though you never gave it to them, they get breached all the time.” "

Trembling startups not long ago, the global technology superelite have amassed the effective power of major nation-states, but without accountability, responsibility for their public influence, transparency, checks and balances or even awareness that they might be a problem rather than a solution. Focus on Facebook and Google, plus Twitter. They are radically unregulated. They hold our most intimate personal information. They have destabilized traditional, fact-based journalism. They have vast wealth ― a combined market value of $1.2 trillion ― and the power that accompanies it. In Washington and other capitals, they lobby hard for their self-interests, often against ours. And during an era when even the National Security Agency gets hacked, they have created data stores that could fundamentally threaten our democracy and others.The internet’s aristocracy arose with the commercialization of the web, starting 20 years ago. To the hectic leaders of Silicon Valley, two decades seems like geologic time – but in the evolving social and political cultures of our species, two decades is the blink of an eye. We haven’t yet absorbed the implications of these potent, purposefully disruptive technologies. We’re addicted to smartphones. We’ve lost control of much of our personal data. The corporate and governmental entities that so voraciously collect our secrets seem indifferent to their protection. Our biometrics will be hacked. Baseless accusations of “fake” corrode the foundations of our civilization. In December, Facebook posted a response to the question: “Is spending time on social media bad for us?” Among the studies reaching that conclusion is one published in the American Journal of Epidemiology, stating: “Our results showed that overall, the use of Facebook was negatively associated with well-being... The negative associations of Facebook use were comparable to or greater in magnitude than the positive impact of offline interactions, which suggests a possible tradeoff between offline and online relationships.” Such are the unintended, faintly understood consequences of commercialized internet technology.Technology alone is not the problem. Our vulnerabilities arise from commerce – specifically, the tech-enabled exploitation of personal data by businesses.Imagine that back in the 1950s, the U.S. Postal Service opened every letter and recorded its contents, while the phone company taped every call. What’s happening now is like that. Back then, though, no one had the computing power, digital storage capacity, or algorithms to make sense of so much data. Now it’s easy. And folks then would have raised hell if the post office or Ma Bell had invaded their privacy; now we give our privacy away. That has enabled a tiny group of companies to establish themselves as hosts of much of our public discourse, by accumulating and exploiting data better than the competition.Unlike businesses that make money principally by selling things, Facebook, Google and Twitter offer services for “free.” In business, “free” almost always is a lie. As an executive taught me ages ago, “If you are not paying for a service, you are what’s being sold.” In exchange for their services, many free-model companies spy on us — memorizing our data, noting our interests, often capturing our keystrokes and following us wherever we venture online. Then they exploit us, by selling advertising individually targeted to us and others, to anyone with a dollar or a ruble. With data on at least two billion users each, Facebook and Google consume consumers the way whales eat krill. According to research firm eMarketer, the two companies together control 60 percent of digital advertising in the U.S.Companies selling digital ads rely on two sources of value: data on individuals and engagement. The more time we spend on Facebook, the more engaged we are, the more ads we see, and the more valuable those ads become. That’s the essence of Facebook’s business. “The thought process that went into building these applications... was all about: ‘How do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?’” Sean Parker, Facebook’s first president, recently recalled. “And that means that we need to sort of give you a little dopamine hit every once in a while... You’re exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology. The inventors… understood this consciously. And we did it anyway.”Roger McNamee, co-founder of Elevation Partners, is a venture capitalist who invested early in Facebook. Now he is terrified of Facebook and disappointed. “They’ve taken techniques that were around for hundreds of years and married them to invasive techniques. The result is brain hacks. People are losing agency, and they don’t realize it. It affects civilization,” he said.It’s normal for media to try to engage consumers, and many stoke interest with sensation. But on a platform like Facebook, human bias for the sensational actually disadvantages rational, fact-based discourse relative to the crazy nonsense freely forwarded by conspiracy nuts, bots and trolls. Socially destructive messages get cheaper and better distribution than constructive ones. And Facebook’s reach – a quarter of the entire human population – dramatically raises the stakes.Danah Boyd, a social network expert and founder of the Data & Society think tank, warns, “Tech companies are ill-prepared for how decentralized networks of people manipulate their systems for fun, profit, politics, and ideology. They often think that they can build better technology to solve the problem, failing to recognize how agile their adversaries truly are.”In this context, Facebook emerges as public enemy number one. It’s by far the biggest social network, 35 times bigger than Twitter. Google purveys such invasive offerings as Gmail, Google Docs, and Google Home. Nevertheless, core Google offerings such as search and maps are grounded in actual reality. Thus, while Facebook’s vulnerability to malicious abuse is bone-deep, deriving from the algorithms that made it successful, Google has a compelling economic interest in what might be called objective truth. “We came from ... a more naive position,” says Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Google’s parent company. “But now, faced with the data and what we’ve seen from Russia in 2016 and with other actors around the world, we have to act.”No such considerations may inhibit Mark Zuckerberg. Facebook’s CEO shows every sign of being in denial. At the Techonomy conference two days after Trump’s victory, Zuckerberg called the idea of Facebook influence on the election “crazy.” When Facebook, Google, and Twitter were called before Congress to testify about Russian meddling in the election, none of their CEOs showed up. Zuckerberg went to Beijing instead, paying homage to China’s Xi Jinping. The fifth-wealthiest person on the planet, and a tireless promoter said to harbor presidential ambitions, Zuckerberg structured even his putative philanthropy, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, as a for-profit LLC that’s free to invest in lobbying. Perhaps disingenuously, he framed Russian interference as a security problem, rather than as a feature of Facebook’s core business. “We’re serious about preventing abuse on our platforms. We’re investing so much in security that it will impact our profitability,” Zuckerberg said. “Protecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits.”McNamee reports that, in 2016, he emailed a friendly warning to Zuckerberg and Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg. He documented seven instances of bad actors abusing Facebook to harm powerless people, “Jim Crow stuff,” he says now. “I hoped they’d take a look.” After waiting four months, a period that included Trump’s election, McNamee began publicly airing his concerns. “They treated it as a PR problem,” he recalls. “They never took it seriously. And now they are lobbying like crazy to protect themselves.” (Facebook has announced the belated implementation of one of McNamee’s suggestions: informing users of their contacts with Russian agents.)Chamath Palihapitiya, formerly Facebook’s head of user growth, told an audience at Stanford University last month, “Even though we feigned this whole line of, like, ‘There probably aren’t any really bad unintended consequences,’ I think in the back, deep, deep recesses of our minds, we kind of knew something bad could happen,” he said. “We have created tools that are ripping apart the social fabric of how society works.” Facebook’s PR apparatus lashed back, “Chamath has not been at Facebook for over six years. When Chamath was at Facebook we were focused on building new social media experiences and growing Facebook around the world. Facebook was a very different company back then and as we have grown we have realised how our responsibilities have grown too. We take our role very seriously and we are working hard to improve.”Now, if ever, is the time for CEOs, writers of algorithms and other architects of our future to take responsibility – before, crippled by self-interest, they irreparably harm us all. Artificial intelligence looms, ominous and unknowable as a Kubrick monolith. AI, like any complex digital product, is a mysterious black box guided, but not illuminated, by data and algorithms. Once set in motion, AIs make decisions that even their makers cannot fathom, much as a major airline today doesn’t know precisely how its computers priced a seat. It may not be long before AIs shape the fates of our species and our planet.But even cadres of enlightened CEOs will not suffice to turn things around, warns Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, which advocates to protect democratic institutions from digital threats. “We need to realize that the tech world cannot regulate itself,” he says. “We need to end the myth that there are technological solutions to all problems provoked by technology. We need to develop social and political solutions.”Our ultimate champions must be ourselves. Start by quitting Facebook. Here’s how: After downloading your data, go here and click on the blue button marked “Delete My Account.” I just did it, and I feel better already.

Trembling startups not long ago, the global technology superelite have amassed the effective power of major nation-states, but without accountability, responsibility for their public influence, transparency, checks and balances or even awareness that they might be a problem rather than a solution. Focus on Facebook and Google, plus Twitter. They are radically unregulated. They hold our most intimate personal information. They have destabilized traditional, fact-based journalism. They have vast wealth ― a combined market value of $1.2 trillion ― and the power that accompanies it. In Washington and other capitals, they lobby hard for their self-interests, often against ours. And during an era when even the National Security Agency gets hacked, they have created data stores that could fundamentally threaten our democracy and others.The internet’s aristocracy arose with the commercialization of the web, starting 20 years ago. To the hectic leaders of Silicon Valley, two decades seems like geologic time – but in the evolving social and political cultures of our species, two decades is the blink of an eye. We haven’t yet absorbed the implications of these potent, purposefully disruptive technologies. We’re addicted to smartphones. We’ve lost control of much of our personal data. The corporate and governmental entities that so voraciously collect our secrets seem indifferent to their protection. Our biometrics will be hacked. Baseless accusations of “fake” corrode the foundations of our civilization. In December, Facebook posted a response to the question: “Is spending time on social media bad for us?” Among the studies reaching that conclusion is one published in the American Journal of Epidemiology, stating: “Our results showed that overall, the use of Facebook was negatively associated with well-being... The negative associations of Facebook use were comparable to or greater in magnitude than the positive impact of offline interactions, which suggests a possible tradeoff between offline and online relationships.” Such are the unintended, faintly understood consequences of commercialized internet technology.Technology alone is not the problem. Our vulnerabilities arise from commerce – specifically, the tech-enabled exploitation of personal data by businesses.Imagine that back in the 1950s, the U.S. Postal Service opened every letter and recorded its contents, while the phone company taped every call. What’s happening now is like that. Back then, though, no one had the computing power, digital storage capacity, or algorithms to make sense of so much data. Now it’s easy. And folks then would have raised hell if the post office or Ma Bell had invaded their privacy; now we give our privacy away. That has enabled a tiny group of companies to establish themselves as hosts of much of our public discourse, by accumulating and exploiting data better than the competition.Unlike businesses that make money principally by selling things, Facebook, Google and Twitter offer services for “free.” In business, “free” almost always is a lie. As an executive taught me ages ago, “If you are not paying for a service, you are what’s being sold.” In exchange for their services, many free-model companies spy on us — memorizing our data, noting our interests, often capturing our keystrokes and following us wherever we venture online. Then they exploit us, by selling advertising individually targeted to us and others, to anyone with a dollar or a ruble. With data on at least two billion users each, Facebook and Google consume consumers the way whales eat krill. According to research firm eMarketer, the two companies together control 60 percent of digital advertising in the U.S.Companies selling digital ads rely on two sources of value: data on individuals and engagement. The more time we spend on Facebook, the more engaged we are, the more ads we see, and the more valuable those ads become. That’s the essence of Facebook’s business. “The thought process that went into building these applications... was all about: ‘How do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?’” Sean Parker, Facebook’s first president, recently recalled. “And that means that we need to sort of give you a little dopamine hit every once in a while... You’re exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology. The inventors… understood this consciously. And we did it anyway.”Roger McNamee, co-founder of Elevation Partners, is a venture capitalist who invested early in Facebook. Now he is terrified of Facebook and disappointed. “They’ve taken techniques that were around for hundreds of years and married them to invasive techniques. The result is brain hacks. People are losing agency, and they don’t realize it. It affects civilization,” he said.It’s normal for media to try to engage consumers, and many stoke interest with sensation. But on a platform like Facebook, human bias for the sensational actually disadvantages rational, fact-based discourse relative to the crazy nonsense freely forwarded by conspiracy nuts, bots and trolls. Socially destructive messages get cheaper and better distribution than constructive ones. And Facebook’s reach – a quarter of the entire human population – dramatically raises the stakes.Danah Boyd, a social network expert and founder of the Data & Society think tank, warns, “Tech companies are ill-prepared for how decentralized networks of people manipulate their systems for fun, profit, politics, and ideology. They often think that they can build better technology to solve the problem, failing to recognize how agile their adversaries truly are.”In this context, Facebook emerges as public enemy number one. It’s by far the biggest social network, 35 times bigger than Twitter. Google purveys such invasive offerings as Gmail, Google Docs, and Google Home. Nevertheless, core Google offerings such as search and maps are grounded in actual reality. Thus, while Facebook’s vulnerability to malicious abuse is bone-deep, deriving from the algorithms that made it successful, Google has a compelling economic interest in what might be called objective truth. “We came from ... a more naive position,” says Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Google’s parent company. “But now, faced with the data and what we’ve seen from Russia in 2016 and with other actors around the world, we have to act.”No such considerations may inhibit Mark Zuckerberg. Facebook’s CEO shows every sign of being in denial. At the Techonomy conference two days after Trump’s victory, Zuckerberg called the idea of Facebook influence on the election “crazy.” When Facebook, Google, and Twitter were called before Congress to testify about Russian meddling in the election, none of their CEOs showed up. Zuckerberg went to Beijing instead, paying homage to China’s Xi Jinping. The fifth-wealthiest person on the planet, and a tireless promoter said to harbor presidential ambitions, Zuckerberg structured even his putative philanthropy, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, as a for-profit LLC that’s free to invest in lobbying. Perhaps disingenuously, he framed Russian interference as a security problem, rather than as a feature of Facebook’s core business. “We’re serious about preventing abuse on our platforms. We’re investing so much in security that it will impact our profitability,” Zuckerberg said. “Protecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits.”McNamee reports that, in 2016, he emailed a friendly warning to Zuckerberg and Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg. He documented seven instances of bad actors abusing Facebook to harm powerless people, “Jim Crow stuff,” he says now. “I hoped they’d take a look.” After waiting four months, a period that included Trump’s election, McNamee began publicly airing his concerns. “They treated it as a PR problem,” he recalls. “They never took it seriously. And now they are lobbying like crazy to protect themselves.” (Facebook has announced the belated implementation of one of McNamee’s suggestions: informing users of their contacts with Russian agents.)Chamath Palihapitiya, formerly Facebook’s head of user growth, told an audience at Stanford University last month, “Even though we feigned this whole line of, like, ‘There probably aren’t any really bad unintended consequences,’ I think in the back, deep, deep recesses of our minds, we kind of knew something bad could happen,” he said. “We have created tools that are ripping apart the social fabric of how society works.” Facebook’s PR apparatus lashed back, “Chamath has not been at Facebook for over six years. When Chamath was at Facebook we were focused on building new social media experiences and growing Facebook around the world. Facebook was a very different company back then and as we have grown we have realised how our responsibilities have grown too. We take our role very seriously and we are working hard to improve.”Now, if ever, is the time for CEOs, writers of algorithms and other architects of our future to take responsibility – before, crippled by self-interest, they irreparably harm us all. Artificial intelligence looms, ominous and unknowable as a Kubrick monolith. AI, like any complex digital product, is a mysterious black box guided, but not illuminated, by data and algorithms. Once set in motion, AIs make decisions that even their makers cannot fathom, much as a major airline today doesn’t know precisely how its computers priced a seat. It may not be long before AIs shape the fates of our species and our planet.But even cadres of enlightened CEOs will not suffice to turn things around, warns Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, which advocates to protect democratic institutions from digital threats. “We need to realize that the tech world cannot regulate itself,” he says. “We need to end the myth that there are technological solutions to all problems provoked by technology. We need to develop social and political solutions.”Our ultimate champions must be ourselves. Start by quitting Facebook. Here’s how: After downloading your data, go here and click on the blue button marked “Delete My Account.” I just did it, and I feel better already.

Idaho is now home to the United States’ first International Dark Sky Reserve.The International Dark Sky Association, an Arizona-based nonprofit that advocates against light pollution, designated an area covering more than 1,400 square miles as the Central Idaho Dark Sky Reserve on Monday. The reserve includes the Sawtooth Range and other wilderness areas that offer brilliant views of the night sky.The designation marks “a watershed moment in the history of American conservation,” J. Scott Feierabend, International Dark Sky Association executive director, said in a statement.An International Dark Sky Reserve is “a public or private land possessing an exceptional or distinguished quality of starry nights and nocturnal environment that is specifically protected for its scientific, natural, educational, cultural, heritage and/or public enjoyment,” according to the association’s website.Land in the Idaho reserve is mostly managed by the U.S. Forest Service, which supports the designation. The Forest Service has reduced light pollution from its facilities, but said mitigation by private interests would be voluntary, according to The Associated Press.The Central Idaho Dark Sky Reserve is the third-largest of 12 such reserves worldwide. Others include Aoraki Mackenzie in New Zealand and Exmoor National Park in England.Idaho’s reserve was granted “gold tier” status, which means the area’s night sky conditions are so pristine that only a small amount of light pollution intrudes. Night sky views are so clear that interstellar dust clouds of the Milky Way galaxy are visible.“That such truly dark nighttime environments still exist in the United States is remarkable, but even more impressive is the effort undertaken to protect them in this case,” Feierabend said.More than 80 percent of North Americans live in areas where light pollution blocks views of the Milky Way, according to a 2016 atlas of artificial light published in the journal Science Advances.“The fact that we’re bathing our planet in artificial light at night is a relatively new phenomenon,” Cheryl Ann Bishop, the Dark Sky Association’s communications director, told NPR. “It’s essentially akin to a human experiment that we’re only just beginning to understand the ramifications of.”"

However, when his father and brother came back, the gun from the car’s glove box was on the floor, and Judah was slumped over with blood on his head, according to WESH.The boy was rushed to a hospital across the street, but died from self-inflicted shooting wounds.Investigators say Todman told them he kept the gun in the glove box and that it was usually locked, according to The Associated Press.The gun is registered to Todman’s wife. Todman himself was convicted of felony possession of a firearm in 2005 and is legally forbidden from owning a firearm.In addition to the negligence charge, Todman was charged with carrying a concealed firearm by a convicted felon, according to the Orlando Sentinel. Monday’s arrest came after an investigation lasting over two months. Todman has since bonded out of jail, according to NBC Miami.Gunshot wounds are now the third leading cause of childhood deaths in the U.S., according to a study published earlier this year in the journal Pediatrics."

That was part of a total of more than $340,000 in settlements involving House offices, which also included various cases of discrimination.The settlements, which are not named, came from a little-known Treasury Department fund that is used to settle workplace claims involving Capitol Hill lawmakers.Sexual misconduct claims against congressional lawmakers have recently led to resignation or retirement announcements from members of both parties, including Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.), Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.), Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Texas) and Rep. Ruben Kihuen (D-Nev.).In 2014, Farenthold reportedly used the taxpayer fund to pay $84,000 to settle a sexual harassment claim from his former communications director, Lauren Greene. According to the Office of Compliance, that settlement was the only House payment from the fund over the last five years that involved sexual harassment.Farenthold would not confirm or deny that the payment involved his office, saying in a statement that “the Congressional Accountability Act prohibits me from answering that question.”Some lawmakers have now called for more transparency involving settlements.Earlier this month, Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) called for the release of similar data involving Senate offices. But on Monday, the Office of Compliance denied his request, saying that it “does not possess reliable information.”Legislators in both the House and the Senate have introduced proposals to restrict the use of taxpayer-funded settlements. A bill in the Senate includes a provision to force lawmakers to pay settlements out of their own pockets, part of broader legislation that aims to overhaul the byzantine system for addressing sexual misconduct incidents in Congress.If you have more information about sexual misconduct settlements on Capitol Hill, contact us at scoops@huffpost.com."

The co-creator, executive producer and star of “Insecure” is working on a comedy series and a drama series, Deadline reports. The single-camera comedy, titled “Him Or Her,” centers on the love life of a bisexual black man and “the distinctly different worlds and relationships he finds himself in,” per Deadline.Rae told HuffPost she’s helping to develop the show as an executive producer, but former “Daily Show” writer Travon Free created the series, which is based on his own experiences. “I was immediately drawn in to the concept from his initial pitch and am SO grateful that he’s trusting us with his vision,” Rae said in an email.The second project is titled “Sweet Life” and will be set in Los Angeles County’s Windsor Hills neighborhood, part of an area sometimes called the “black Beverly Hills.” “Sweet Life” is co-created and co-written by Rae and Raamla Mohamed, a writer on ABC’s hit show “Scandal.” (The title may come from a Frank Ocean song, “Sweet Life,” where he sings about “Ladera Heights, the black Beverly Hills.” Rae is a noted Frank Ocean fan.)“The idea for the series initially came from a joke pitch I presented to The New Yorker. I had always wanted to create a teen movie about Windsor Hills, but never thought about doing a TV show,” Rae said. “Once my joke TV pitch kind of went viral, I was like, ‘Oh, duh. Let me just do my movie idea as a TV show.’” (More about that pitch here.) HBO has not set a release date for either series.

Abrams pitched his script for Episode IX to Lucasfilm executives. Shooting is set to begin in June, so now, while the creative iron is still hot as the molten wreckage of the Death Star, is the perfect time to remind Abrams of one thing he said should be included in these films: Gay people.Abrams, who gave us amazing new characters like Finn and Poe Dameron and their glittering on-screen chemistry and is returning to direct Episode IX, told audiences at a pre-Oscars event last year that “of course” future films should include gay characters.""To me, the fun of Star Wars is the glory of possibility,"" Abrams said, according to the Daily Beast. ""So it seems insanely narrow-minded and counterintuitive to say that there wouldn't be a homosexual character in that world.""It is insanely counterintuitive to say there are no LGBTQ people in the entire Star Wars galaxy — and yet, we’ve seen absolutely zero evidence in the films that they exist. Force-wielding space monks and little teddy bear aliens (hell, even Jar Jar Binks) are easier to believe in than a world populated entirely by heterosexual, cisgender people.And we deserve better.As I’ve argued before, stories matter. Representation matters. It changes minds, saves lives, and evolves our stories. It humanizes those unlike ourselves and is a powerful celebration of the diversity of the real world, which are both time-honored components of science fiction.Stories give us hope, and no story is more about hope than Star Wars. Representation lets us see ourselves reflected there, and we all deserve to know we can be heroes.This act of conscious inclusion is even more important in the current political climate, but Hollywood hasn’t been doing its part. Only 18.4% of films released by major studies in 2016 included characters who were explicitly LGBTQ, according to GLAAD’s Studio Responsibility Index . Disney in particular is dropping the ball, with no films with LGBTQ characters in 2015 and only one last year. That film was Zootopia, with a pair of non-human background characters who weren’t even acknowledged as gay in the film itself. Disney, as the shepards of both the Star Wars franchise and the Marvel Cinematic Universe, is perfectly situated to provide the most powerful, impactful, and farthest-reaching representation. Yet both of those major franchises still feature zero LGBTQ characters.It’s time that Disney and Lucasfilm acknowledge the existence of LGBTQ people by backing Abrams and allowing him to include the representation he values. In his own words, “I would love it.” The Star Wars universe already missed an opportunity in The Last Jedi with Admiral Holdo, who is described as pansexual in the books but not confirmed as queer in the film. Another missed opportunity came from Baze and Chirrut in Rogue One, though it’s already a lost cause convincing me and many other fans they weren’t a couple. They should not let another opportunity pass with Finn and Poe — who already have fans whispering, hoping, and seeing themselves in the two daring, diverse rebels.A relationship between these two would be especially important. The racial diversity of LGBTQ characters has been dramatically dropping over the past three years. Of the 70 LGBTQ characters GLAAD counted in 2016, only 20 percent were people of color. That includes only 13 percent black characters and only one Latinx character. The force is clearly not one with these numbers: We can, and must, do better. This is not about “SJW” pandering. The impact of Star Wars on U.S. and global culture is powerful and wide-reaching. Its continued erasure of LGBTQ lives, when there is such clear potential for meaningful connection and representation, helps maintain a dangerous environment for queer people on a global scale. Placing women and non-white characters into more important, even leading, roles has already had a huge positive impact. A gay relationship between a black leading man and an important Latino character could have an equally powerful impact.It’s not like it would come as a shock. Rumors and theories have been swirling about Finn and Poe since the first film. Everyone from casual fans to professional media outlets to devout fanatics have noticed the potential. We know it’s been actively discussed by the creative team. Rian Johnson has teased it. The head of Lucasfilm has teased it. The cast has hinted at it many, many times. Oscar Isaac, who plays Poe, has said he would be “very open” to exploring such a storyline and that it would be important that “people can see themselves in a hero like this, in a movie like this.” Not to mention the many fans holding their breath and crossing their fingers and excruciatingly yearning for the very possibility.It’s great that the Powers That Be are at least giving lip service to seriously discussing fans’ hopes, but we’re ready for more than subtext and hints. We’re ready to see ourselves reflected in our favorite stories. We’re ready to tell the stories of those who have been erased, in a universe full of wonder and possibilities and hope.So, Abrams, we want to believe you when you say: “It’s in private meetings, it’s in private phone calls, it’s in interviews. I know that this will happen. I know it will.” Please, we’re begging you, fight like hell for us.And Disney, Lucasfilm, anyone involved in the creative direction of the franchise, please don’t stand in his way. Consider your fans. Consider the impact. Consider your responsibilities as storytellers and the empowerment of a future generation of frightened children (and, frankly, adults) who want to believe they can be heroes.The time is now. Put your money where your mouth is. Give us the space gays."

After suffering through their own version of hell in escaping Somalia and then Sudan, Rashid Mohamed and Hasen and one of their sons ended up in Egypt.The chances of this miracle turning into a happy ending are slim as the Trump administration intensifies its crusade to slam America’s doors in the face of immigrants and refugees. Once the 120-day suspension of the U.S. refugee resettlement program elapsed in October, President Donald Trump imposed a fresh set of restrictions on the system, two of which affect Hasen and Mohamed directly: a pause on the program that allows families to reunite and increased security measures targeting 11 countries, Somalia included.To add insult to injury, the Supreme Court ruled earlier this month to let the third iteration of Trump’s travel ban take full effect, superseding the federal court rulings in two states that had blocked the ban for being discriminatory.Elizabeth Ross, the preferred communities coordinator at the International Institute of Minnesota and Hasen’s former case worker, told HuffPost that they’re reviewing Hasen’s options and in the meantime asked her to gather as much paperwork from her estranged family members as she can. The resettlement agency is still processing family reunification applications “so that when it’s no longer paused we will move forward.” Yet the program would only apply to Mohamed ― because two of the couple’s sons (one of whom is his father’s caretaker in Cairo, while the other is still living in Somalia) are over the age of 21, they don’t qualify. There’s another program for families of refugees that the administration didn’t place on hold: the Affidavit of Relationship, which doesn’t carry an age limit. Yet it typically takes many years for families to be reunited under this program, Ross said.Families all over the country are grappling with similar issues, which prompted advocacy groups to sue Trump last month. “With family members stuck in limbo and awaiting the chance at safety in the United States, our clients here are begging us, ‘Please save my sister and her little boy. Please save my cousin,’” Mindy Berkowitz, executive director of Jewish Family Services of Silicon Valley and one of the suit’s plaintiffs, said. “These refugees cannot go back to their home countries for fear of further persecution, and now America is turning its back on them in their time of urgent need.”What’s most important to Hasen is that her family members are alive after all these years.“This is something that we never, ever believed was going to happen,” she said.But she’s worried about her husband’s health. “He’s becoming old and is very sick, he has diabetes and high blood pressure and can’t see out of one eye. One of my sons is with him because sometimes he can’t see and can’t walk,” she said.Ross cautioned that once the elation fades, the reality of the impasse Hasen faces will take its toll on her. Even though Hasen and her children now have green cards, they aren’t advised to travel to visit their family members in Egypt because they may not be allowed back into the country given how volatile the immigration environment is, Ross added.“I don’t know what to do, I wish I could fly and bring you but I don’t know what I can do,” Hasen said. “But we are trying our best, you have to smile a little and you have to cry again, we just pray to God that he can come and we can live as a big family again.”"

In 2015, the freeskier was widely praised for opening up about his sexuality in an emotional ESPN Magazine cover story. Now, he’s poised to become the first openly gay male athlete to ever compete at the Winter Games ― and it’s a prospect he doesn’t take lightly.“The thought of being the first openly gay male ever to compete in the Winter Olympics — I totally embrace that,” Kenworthy told Time magazine Monday. “I so badly want to inspire that community and do well for them. It’s fucking cool.”The 26-year-old, who is currently in a relationship with “Gayby” actor Matthew Wilkas, also recalled the experience of competing at the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, while still in the closet. Looking back, he said he feels “very dishonest and disingenuous,” which makes him even more determined to succeed at the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea.Both Kenworthy and figure skater Adam Rippon, who is gay, are currently competing to qualify for the games, which kick off Feb. 9. They should know their statuses by January. (Luger John Fennell, who came out as gay in 2014 after competing at Sochi, was also in the running, but a Dec. 14 sled malfunction ended his hopes prematurely.)“I don’t think I could have ever come out as a gay athlete 30 years ago and expected to be successful in my sport,” Kenworthy said. “My story’s indicative of change.” In 2015, ESPN explained how high the stakes can be for major athletes to come out:Kenworthy is not an average 24-year-old. He is the top freeskier on the planet, an Olympic medalist, a face of the X Games. He is an elite athlete competing in the world of action sports, where sponsors ― and income ― are inextricably linked to image. In other words, he is an athlete with a lot to lose. In the two years since Kenworthy came out, he’s become an outspoken LGBTQ rights advocate. One thing he won’t do, however, is accept an invitation from President Donald Trump to visit the White House, as Team USA members have traditionally done after the Olympics. Pointing to Trump’s anti-LGBTQ platform, Kenworthy told Time he has “no interest in faking support” for the president.Read the full Time interview with Gus Kenworthy here. "

Now a big effort is being done to switch the system from punishment to help.”,2017-12-19,"The Norwegian Parliament, also known as the Storting, has started the process to decriminalize drug use and emphasize treatment options.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a387cfa150000144449c6a8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Norway’s Parliament is set to decriminalize illicit drugs and divert people found with small quantities into treatment options rather than pursuing criminal prosecution.Drug use, from marijuana to cocaine and heroin, would be decriminalized under the plan, similar to the system in Portugal, which has been held up as a model by drug law reformers worldwide as a preferable option to jailing drug users. The plan was supported by a majority of the Norwegian Parliament, known as the Storting.A report from the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction earlier this year found that 8.6 percent of Norwegians ages 16 to 34 had used cannabis (marijuana) in the past year, with 2.2 percent using cocaine and 1.2 percent using MDMA (ecstasy). The report also found there were more than 48,000 drug law offenses in Norway, while 266 drug overdose deaths had occurred in the country in 2014.The parliamentary result, however, does not automatically decriminalize illicit drugs in Norway. The vote directs the government to begin pursuing changes to laws to reflect the outcome of the vote. There is no draft legislation yet that actually would enact the change, according to Parliament.“The majority in the parliament has asked the government to prepare for reform,” a Storting spokesperson told Newsweek. “It has started a political process… it’s just the starting point.” Under the plan, users who are caught with small quantities of drugs would be placed into treatment programs.The government “will stop punishing people who struggle but instead give them help and treatment,” Nicolas Wilkinson, health spokesman for the Socialist Left party, told Norwegian media outlet VG. “This is the start of a big rush reform. Now a big effort is being done to switch the system from punishment to help.”Sveinung Stensland, deputy chairman of the Storting’s health committee, told VG that Norway would not be legalizing the drugs, just decriminalizing their use.“The change will take some time, but that means a changed vision: Those who have a substance abuse problem should be treated as ill, and not as criminals with classical sanctions such as fines and imprisonment,” he told VG.Portugal decriminalized drugs in 2001 after years of harsh policy failed to have a significant effect on drug usage or deaths. Instead of fining or jailing drug users found with small quantities of drugs, the government started placing them in treatment and counseling programs.A 2014 report from Transform Drug Policy Foundation found the total number of people in Portugal who had used drugs at any point in their lives rose after decriminalization in 2001 through 2012, but the numbers of people who had used drugs at any point in the year or month before they were surveyed actually decreased, meaning fewer were using drugs on a regular basis.Drug-related deaths, cases of HIV and AIDS among drug users and general rates of drug use all sharply declined from 2001 to 2012 in Portugal, the report found.“It is important for all parties involved in this that it is about large-scale reforms: how to support people and help them out of drug abuse,” Wilkinson said.“If we have to wait another year for it to really work, it’s worth it.”"

Officials from the National Development and Reform Commission unveiled the highly anticipated emissions trading system during a conference call with industry and government representatives, the Australian Financial Review reported.Though not as ambitious a scheme originally touted, the program — which will cover China’s power sector in its first phase — has already overtaken the European Union carbon market as the world’s largest.“The launching of China’s national emissions trading system is asignificant step in a long march toward a clean energy economy,” Zou Ji, president of Energy Foundation China, told HuffPost in a statement. “By launching, China sends a strong political signal internationally that China is keeping its global commitments, and is committed to the Paris Agreement.” Xi vowed in 2015 to establish a nationwide cap-and-trade program that would set limits on greenhouse gas emissions and allow polluters to buy and sell emission credits. The idea had been for the Chinese marketplace to cover eight economic sectors, but that plan was whittled down for the program’s launch.China will start with its power sector, which accounts for 46 percent of the nation’s carbon dioxide emissions. (The first phase of the cap-and-trade program will reportedly cover an estimated 39 percent of the country’s emissions.) China says it intends to eventually expand the program to petrochemicals, iron and steel, and aviation, among other industries. As Quartz reported, trading in the emissions credits won’t begin until the regulations are fully fleshed out. Energy Foundation China said the market is expected to be fully operational by 2019.If all goes well, experts say the program could help China hit its Paris climate agreement targets. The market could reduce China’s carbon dioxide emissions by almost 30 percent by 2030, a rep for Climate Nexus told HuffPost on Tuesday.A successful program may secure China’s status as a climate leader, particularly as the U.S. retreats from what had been a prominent role. Miguel Arias Cañete, the EU’s climate action and energy commissioner, celebrated China’s news in a laudatory tweet on Tuesday.“This announcement sends a very strong signal: the world is changing with new, broad climate leadership,” he wrote. Trump’s administration on Monday made clear that it no longer considered climate change a national security threat, breaking with 20 years of military planning. Climate change was conspicuously missing from the White House National Security Strategy report, which described China as a “rival power” rather than a partner. Trump, who infamously called global warming a Chinese hoax, has announced his intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris accord. Fifty world leaders recently gathered in Paris for a climate change conference. Trump was not invited.China’s goals for its new carbon market could prove challenging to achieve. As Scientific American notes, no carbon trading system in the world, including those in the EU and in California, has resulted in significant reductions in CO2 emissions. China’s slow start, however, may show the country’s resolve, experts say. It’s “a sign that China is taking this seriously and wants to make sure they’re doing it right,” Barbara Finamore, Asia director for the China program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, told Scientific American."

People donate toys and coats, volunteer time and energy, and contribute to charities that help other people in many ways. But when we aim our compassion, it’s important to include at-risk animals as well – and not just dogs and cats. In fact, with one trip to the grocery store, we can help vulnerable animals, our environment, and humans at the same time. It starts with realizing that, each year, more than 9 billion farm animals are raised in horrendous and often cruel conditions to create food products. Idyllic images, words, and labels on food packages may paint ideal pictures of animals living peacefully on small farms, but the truth is a much different story. The vast majority of animal products come from farms using inhumane confinement and breeding practices that emphasize production efficiency over animal welfare. Egg-laying hens and mother pigs are kept in cages so small that they cannot turn around or stretch their limbs. Dairy cows and chickens have been bred to produce so much milk and meat that they suffer from painful physical conditions like sores and lameness. These unhealthy, unnatural and stressful conditions can also be directly tied to the spread of diseases in our food supply, unsafe working conditions, environmental pollution, and even antibiotic resistance in humans.These issues may seem insurmountable given powerful food interests and a perceived cultural appetite for cheap food. But there are levers of positive change, and they start with you, the consumer. First, if you choose just one plant-based meal, dish, or ingredient to replace a meat, egg or dairy item, you take an important step toward reducing the demand for inhumane farming and forcing the food industry to improve their practices. If you do eat or plan to serve meat, eggs or dairy this season, make sure they come from farms that adhere to standards of meaningful welfare certifications like Animal Welfare Approved, Certified Humane and Global Animal Partnership (steps 2 and above). In addition to banning cruel practices like caging and crowding, these programs require environments that allow animals to express natural behaviors and verify all standards through in-person audits. The certifications also provide full transparency by making all of their standards accessible online.By choosing these verifiably higher welfare options, you may also be incentivizing major food brands to follow suit. Some of the largest food companies in the world – including Nestle, Burger King, and Walmart – are now making concrete commitments to improve animal welfare. Elevated public values are transforming the ways these and other food companies do business, a trend that will only increase over time as the public becomes more and more aware. Studies show that most consumers do not want animal cruelty to be included in the price of purchasing animal food products.Ideally, the holidays give us all an opportunity to reflect and act on generosity, compassion, and kindness. This year, I encourage you to expand the impact of those impulses by shopping with your heart and considering all the animals who deserve more than another season of suffering.

But he once wanted to shutter it.,2017-12-19,Former Rep. Scott Garrett (R-N.J.) failed in his bid to head the Export-Import Bank.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a392d9e1600002100c50d32.jpeg?cache=Q710tE2bPU&ops=crop_19_0_4909_2821%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The Senate banking committee rejected President Donald Trump’s choice to lead the Export-Import Bank on Tuesday, voting 10-13 against advancing his nomination to the full Senate. Two Republicans joined with Democrats in opposition. Scott Garrett, who was a tea-party-aligned Republican congressman from New Jersey until he lost his re-election bid in 2016, has faced intense opposition from the business community ― including corporations like General Electric Co. and Boeing ― and many traditional GOP allies, such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers. That’s because Garrett once wanted to shutter the institution that he now is trying to run, and he consistently voted against reauthorizing it. In 2015, he lambasted the Export-Import Bank as an institution that “embodies the corruption of the free enterprise system.” “Manufacturers are grateful to have an ally in the White House who seeks to ensure that America and its workers are not left behind as foreign governments do all they can to win in the global economy,” NAM President and CEO Jay Timmons wrote in an October letter to Senate banking committee leaders. “At the same time, the NAM is firmly opposed to the nomination of former U.S. Rep. Scott Garrett (R-NJ) as president of the Ex-Im Bank given his longstanding opposition to its mission and his past actions to destroy the agency.”In his confirmation hearing before the committee last month, Garrett tried to convince senators that he turned over a new leaf. But many of them still seemed skeptical, since he refused to say his previous denunciations were wrong.Instead, Garrett said he was no longer in favor of abolishing the bank because Trump is now president, and he simply wants to run it instead. “Senator, if the question is, what has changed since 2015, what we have seen changed is a new administration,” Garrett said. “What we have seen change is a new agenda by this administration to see to it that the economy actually grows, and that businesses are given a fair chance to grow their businesses both nationally and internationally as well. ... My role has changed. I am not in a legislative function.”On Tuesday, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), the ranking member of the committee, said it was “clear to me that Mr. Garrett is not being honest with this Committee about why he wants to lead the Bank, and many others feel the same.”Sens. Mike Rounds (S.D.) and Tim Scott (S.C.) were the two Republican votes against Garrett. “I believe he’s a principled man who simply believes in the abolishment of the bank,” Rounds said. “While I wish him no ill, I believe he’s not the right person to be the chairman.”“We are disappointed that the Senate Banking Committee missed this opportunity to get the Export Import Bank fully functioning again. We will continue to work with the Committee on a path forward,” said Marc Short, the White House director of legislative affairs.Trump has nominated other individuals to run government agencies that they once fought or opposed. Scott Pruitt is now in charge of the Environmental Protection Agency, and Mick Mulvaney is the interim chairman of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. But both of those agencies are ones that are more universally unpopular with the GOP and its backers. The difference with the Export-Import Bank is that it has more support within the party ― although many conservatives dislike it ― and the business community.“Today’s Senate Banking Committee vote on Ex-Im board nominees is a milestone for manufacturers across the U.S. whose customers require a fully-functioning Ex-Im Bank,” said a GE spokesperson. “We urge the full Senate to move quickly on behalf of US workers and companies of all sizes to guarantee the Bank can once again operate at full strength.”Garrett, a founding member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, lost his 2016 re-election bid in large part due to anti-gay remarks he made. In 2015, Garrett told fellow Republicans in a closed-door meeting that he wouldn’t pay his dues to the National Republican Congressional Committee because the organization supported some gay candidates.Garrett later clarified that he didn’t oppose gay people running for office, but he believed the GOP should not support candidates who back same-sex marriage. His comments cost him support from Wall Street donors, who had been a major source of funding for his previous campaigns."

Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.), Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), Annie Kuster (D-N.H.), Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) and Tom Suozzi (D-N.Y.) discussed the Ending Secrecy About Workplace Sexual Harassment Act and the No Tax Deductions for Sexual Harasser Buyouts Act at a press conference on Monday afternoon. They were joined by representatives from the Feminist Majority Foundation, the ERA Coalition and the National Organization for Women. “With total secrecy, companies have absolutely no incentive to focus on preventing sexual misconduct if they know they will never be held accountable. But with these two bills, we flip the incentive structure from one of cover-up to one of prevention,” Maloney told reporters. The proposed Ending Secrecy About Workplace Sexual Harassment Act takes aim at the nondisclosure agreements that accusers are often forced to sign to win settlements in workplace sexual harassment cases. The bill would require companies to report all court settlements involving sexual harassment, assault and discrimination to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission annually. “When employers don’t have to disclose these internal settlements, when there is no public record about abuse, it can cause great harm to victims, other employees who may not know they’re working in a harassing environment or who the harassers are, and even the public at large,” Maloney said.Suozzi added that “we need to shine a light” on sexual harassment and assault.“We must remember the adage ‘Sunlight is the best disinfectant,’” he said, adding, “By requiring companies to detail sexual harassment data, we can clearly define the extent of this pervasive problem and begin to change this toxic culture of behavior.”The proposed No Tax Deductions for Sexual Harasser Buyouts Act would no longer allow companies to pay million-dollar severances to employees fired for sexual misconduct and then use those buyouts as a way to lower their own taxes. The measure was inspired by Fox News’ recent payment of $25 million to Bill O’Reilly after the cable host was fired over sexual harassment allegations. “Sexual harassment survives in the backrooms and dark places of the American workplace, behind locked doors and a veil of silence and fear,” Raskin said. “This legislation pulls back the curtain and turns on the lights so America knows what’s happening.” Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority Foundation, sounded hopeful about the future: “Feminist leaders are building on the strength and bravery of survivors, and this is the start of us moving forward with real solutions.”"

Progressive activists disrupted the final House of Representatives vote on the tax bill, yelling “Shame!” and other disparaging chants during the speeches and parliamentary procedures that preceded the vote.To prolong the disruptions, most of the chants were done individually rather than as a group. Once a protester rose from the gallery to speak up, staffers quickly removed them from the chamber. They were subsequently subject to arrest by the U.S. Capitol Police, which reported 18 arrests.“Liar, liar. You’re lying. Only the rich people are gonna get anything,” one woman yelled as House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) described what he said would be the legislation’s benefits for ordinary Americans.As the woman was escorted out by staff, she prompted some laughter when she added, “You should go back to school to learn how to do math.”Another demonstrator promised political consequences for the Republican members who voted to enact the tax bill.“We vote too,” she declared. “We’ll remember you. You’re fired.”Another popular chant was “Kill the bill, don’t kill us.” When the final vote occurred, the group chanted in unison, “Shame, shame, shame.”Democratic lawmakers periodically signaled their approval of the protests with applause and cheering.The last-minute disruption of the vote was the culmination of about three weeks of mass civil disobedience by progressive activists, many of whom are people with disabilities.They have focused their criticism of the tax bill on the reductions in social benefits they anticipate. Since the legislation is expected to add $1 trillion to the national debt, it would trigger automatic spending cuts due to so-called “paygo” rules.Liberal critics fear that even if Congress waives paygo rules, as Republican leaders have promised, it would create enormous political pressure to cut essential safety programs.Ady Barkan, a leader of the progressive Center for Popular Democracy who was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis just over a year ago, gave new life to popular resistance earlier this month when a series of videos of him discussing the bill with Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) on an airplane went viral. Barkan worries that the automatic paygo cuts would reduce Medicare and deprive him of the aid he needs to buy a ventilator and other essential medical care.“You could save my life. Please, please remember this conversation,” Barkan told Flake.Barkan has since returned to the Capitol to be arrested multiple times in protest of the bill. He celebrated his 34th birthday on Monday with his participation in a die-in in the rotunda of the Russell Senate Office Building. He was one of 64 demonstrators arrested that night, according to U.S. Capitol Police.On Tuesday morning, Barkan and other activists with disabilities joined House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) at a press conference denouncing the tax legislation.There have been hundreds of arrests at the Capitol in the past three weeks, including three occasions where Barkan was arrested. Barkan was among those chanting on Tuesday, but he did not get arrested.The bill is expected to pass the Senate later on Tuesday.In the final hours ahead of the Senate vote, activists ― many of whom traveled long distances to appear in the Capitol ― converged on the offices of a handful of senators to register their discontent one last time.A delegation of over 15 people from Kansas, the vast majority of whom were under age 30, sought to have a meeting with Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.). Moran’s staff told them the senator was unavailable. Moran has at times expressed reservations about the tax bill, but his support for it has never truly been in question.For the group of young activists from Kansas, it was specially disheartening that Moran would support a bill after the state’s experiment with dramatic tax cuts. Kansas’ bond rating was downgraded and its education funding gutted, prompting a revolt against Gov. Sam Brownback (R) from within his own party.“Sen. Moran can’t claim ignorance. He knows what has happened in our state,” said Logan Hoover, a 28-year-old graduate student at Kansas State who drove two days to get to Washington, D.C.Several demonstrators expressed concern about the tax bill’s elimination of the individual insurance mandate, which the Congressional Budget Office estimates would result in 13 million fewer Americans having insurance.Cameron Smith, 19, an undergraduate student at the University of Kansas, flew to Washington for the second time in two weeks to protest the bill. Smith was arrested during a demonstration two weeks ago and again on Monday. Smith has bipolar disorder, which she treats thanks to the health insurance she gets through her father, who is a career military officer. But Smith said, choking back tears, that she couldn’t imagine what it must be like to have a medical issue and no coverage. The GOP tax bill “affects every other person who doesn’t live in that top 1 percent,” Smith said.One of those people is Marlo Dean, 47, who flew in from Virginia Beach, Virginia, to protest the bill and the Medicaid cuts she anticipates it will generate. She brought her 15-year-old son, Dante, with her. He has a rare neurological condition called Batten disease, which requires around-the-clock in-home nursing care.“The cuts to Medicaid and the program that Dante’s in will take his life,” Dean said.Hoover, Smith and Dean congregated with others outside the office of Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), where several demonstrators staged a die-in to mimic the deadly effect they say that the legislation could have. Using the call-and-response technique of the “human microphone,” protesters took turns telling stories of medical hardship. Speaking through a megaphone, the Capitol police warned those who had laid down on the floor that they were violating the law and would risk arrest if they did not move. Then, like clockwork, the police began creating a perimeter around the so-called “prisoners,” obstructing the view of onlookers and reporters hoping to document the dramatic scene.As of Wednesday morning, the Capitol police reported that there were 33 arrests during demonstrations in the Senate office buildings on Tuesday. An additional 12 people were arrested for disruptions during the final Senate vote on the tax bill on Tuesday evening.One of the arrestees was Jenson Larrimore, a 36-year-old who decided to drive up from Richmond, Virginia, to protest the tax bill after seeing Barkan on television last week. Larrimore, a former chef, was riding on a moped during a visit to Maui, Hawaii, about 11 years ago. He lost the use of his body from his midsection down.“I would not have lived and survived to tell the tale in this house had it not been for Medicaid,” Larrimore said before his arrest.Larrimore now lives on Medicare and disability benefits, and he was at the Senate office buildings to defend his benefits as much as anyone else’s. But as the cops wheeled him away, his hands in zip-tie handcuffs in front of him, Larrimore warned able-bodied, gainfully employed Americans that the tax bill would hurt them too.“If you think because you’re not here, or you have a job, or you worked for it, that this won’t affect you, then you’re wrong,” he said, his voice trailing off as the elevator doors closed behind him.This story has been updated with information about the protests on Tuesday evening and more current information on the total number of arrests.

Trump has been accused of some form of sexual misconduct, ranging from harassment to assault and rape, by 21 women. According to the survey, 59 percent of women and 41 percent of men say that Trump should leave office because of the allegations. The findings demonstrated a clear partisan divide on the issue, with 85 percent of Democrats and only 7 percent of Republicans favoring the president’s resignation.Self-identified independent voters were somewhat split, with 52 percent calling for Trump’s resignation and 44 percent saying he should stay in office.More than half (66 percent) of voters believe that Trump does not respect women as much as he does men. The poll surveyed 1,230 American voters through telephone interviews between Dec. 13 and Dec. 18. Trump has denied all allegations against him, most recently tweeting that the accusations are “fake news.” In October, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders suggested that all of Trump’s accusers were lying.Multiple members of Congress, including Sens. Cory Booker (N.J.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.), have called on the president to resign over the allegations. More than 100 Democrats in the U.S. House recently signed a letter urging Congress to open an investigation into the accusations. Four of Trump’s accusers recently held a press conference to call on Congress to investigate their claims. “People are being held accountable for unwanted behavior, but we are not holding our president accountable for what he is and who he is,” Jessica Leeds, who accused Trump of groping her on a plane over 30 years ago, said in a press conference last week.

But school shootings didn’t begin, or end, with Sandy Hook. Yahoo News looks at the aftermath of four of these tragedies and the lives they changed. In this story, we examine how 20 years on, Jonesboro, Ark., is still traumatized by an attack carried out by two middle-school boys — and how survivors deal with the knowledge that the killers are now grown men and free from prison. In other stories we look at the lessons from Sandy Hook that may have helped save lives at a California school just last month and at how the parents of a girl killed in Newtown are coping with their loss._____JONESBORO, Ark. — Sometimes the feeling of anguish comes out of nowhere. Maybe it’s triggered by a certain shift in the wind or when the temperature is warm but not too warm. Sometimes it’s seeing something on television that suddenly brings it all back, a memory of a horrible day that happened long ago but is as vivid as if it were yesterday.For Lynette Thetford, it is the warmth of the early spring that has often proved to be most challenging, and for nearly two decades she has steeled herself waiting for those difficult days, bracing for the pain and memories that inevitably come rushing back no matter how much she prays to God for strength and healing, no matter how far she’s come.Over the years, Thetford has gotten more adept at keeping it together, reliant on her strong Christian faith and protected by a cocoon of family, friends and colleagues who make sure she feels loved and safe. But last February, the darkness enveloped her when she wasn’t expecting it — an unusually mild day in the dead of the winter. It was the kind of day most people live for, especially the kids at Nettleton Junior High, where she works in the library. But in the early afternoon, Thetford felt her heart racing and her emotions plummeting. She struggled to breathe and tried not to cry. Soon she was over “the cliff,” as she put it, back in the emotional abyss.“I wasn’t ready for it,” Thetford recalled, her voice a little shaky. “When it gets to the conditions of the air, when the weather was like it was that day — I know it’s been, like, 19 years, but I still have that relapse.”Thetford can’t help but think of another warm day, March 24, 1998, when she had walked out into the yard behind the nearby Westside Middle School, where she taught sixth-grade social studies. A fire alarm had gone off just after lunch, disrupting the beginning of fifth period. At first it wasn’t clear if it was a drill or a prank. It would turn out to be something far worse. As the students and teachers exited into the back schoolyard, gunfire rang out. From a makeshift sniper’s nest in woods behind the building, two students, Andrew Golden, 11, and Mitchell Johnson, 13, fired dozens of shots at their teachers and peers, using guns stolen that morning from Golden’s grandfather.In a matter of minutes, the boys killed five people — four sixth-grade girls and a teacher — and injured 10 others, including Thetford, who was shot in the lower abdomen as she tried to steer those around her to safety. The bullet ripped through her intestines and severely injured the nerves that control her legs, causing her to fall forward to the ground unable to move. She was dragged to safety and kept from bleeding to death by colleagues who put pressure on her wound, but it took her months to learn how to walk again.Before Columbine and Sandy Hook, before Sutherland Springs and Las Vegas and Orlando and San Bernardino and Charleston and Aurora and Virginia Tech and all the other mass shootings that have stunned and numbed the country over the past two decades, it was Jonesboro in the headlines, a small town that few outside of Arkansas had ever heard of. It was Jonesboro that horrified the nation and stripped away the innocence of teachers and students who had never imagined such evil descending on them, their school and their community.***What makes the Jonesboro case unique is that the shooters survived their rampage and have had the opportunity to explain but simply haven’t. Unlike other killers, such as Adam Lanza in Newtown and Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold in Columbine, Johnson and Golden didn’t turn their guns on themselves, which makes them a rarity among school shooters. The boys were apprehended as they ran away, toward a van packed with camping supplies and food for an apparent escape.Each boy faced five counts of murder, which likely would have merited life in prison or even the death penalty had they been adults. But under Arkansas state law at the time, the two could only be charged as juveniles and held in jail only until they were 18, their records sealed. A little maneuvering allowed federal officials to add on three more years for weapons charges, keeping them in prison until they were 21.In 2005, Johnson was released from prison after serving seven years, though he soon ran afoul of the law and briefly went back. In 2007, Golden was released and changed his name to Drew Grant — a detail uncovered only when he filed for a concealed weapons permit a year later. Arkansas State Police identified him through his fingerprints and denied the application. It wasn’t because of his criminal record — technically he didn’t have one, because the murder charges had been expunged. They rejected him because they said he wasn’t truthful on his application. Asked for his residential history, he had omitted the address of the correctional facility where he’d been locked up for years. Because they were juveniles, their case remained largely shrouded in secrecy, and according to those close to the case, the boys declined to talk to investigators or offer any insight into what led to their deadly ambush. But they were forced to testify in a wrongful death civil case brought by the families and a hard-charging local attorney named Bobby McDaniel who was determined to seek answers from them.In August 2017, hours of videotaped depositions of Johnson and Golden were released after a judge slapped the killers with a $150 million civil judgment — money the families do not expect to see. But they wanted the world to watch and learn from Jonesboro in hopes that their tragedy could produce lessons for other communities. According to McDaniel, they wanted do what they could to stop the tragedy from recurring and to offer something more enduring in the hopes that Jonesboro would be more than just another statistic.“The real important aspect of this case is the why was it done, what did we learn from it, and how can we implement what we’ve learned?” McDaniel said.In the testimony, which dates back nearly a decade, the public can hear and see the boys speaking for the first time about their crimes. The videos still offer no direct answer for the question “why?” The shooters, by then young men, largely blame each other for whose idea it was to ambush their school, as they did when they were first apprehended. Johnson claims Golden made him do it, and Golden testified that Johnson threatened to kill his family if he didn’t participate — dueling testimony that often rings hollow.But Johnson seems more forthcoming than Golden about what led up to the shooting and what pushed him over the edge.“I remember feeling like I was trapped, like no one understood me,” Johnson testified in 2007. “I felt cornered. I felt like I didn’t have anywhere to go, nothing to do. I thought my life, you know, was at an end. … I had a lot of people who were against me then.”Johnson’s testimony included several dispassionate apologies to his victims. But echoing the little boy who felt the world was against him, he also sounds like a young man with his back against the wall, complaining of not being able to hold down a job because everybody knows who he is and what he did. “Society is cruel, you know, especially towards a murderer,” Johnson testified. “It’s just something I live with every day.”Even in a churchgoing community where many believe in forgiving others as God has forgiven them, some survivors found Johnson’s comments chilling and hard to believe. The fact that he and Golden are free today disturbs and frightens many survivors. They worry about running into one or both and fret about the mindset of someone who may someday feel once again that the world is against him.Though public records suggest both men now live out of state — Golden in Missouri and Johnson in Texas — some family members of the victims and survivors declined to speak about what happened in Jonesboro and their experience in the nearly two decades since, in part because they expressed fear of retaliation from the shooters. “Who knows what’s going on with them?” one said.Nearly 20 years later, Thetford, who is 61, still sometimes limps, especially when she’s tired. And some days, in spite of her strong faith in God and her belief that she must have been spared for a reason, Thetford can’t help but feel tired. Tired of the guilt that never quite goes away and the shredded emotions that come with living through something that, back then, was not nearly as common as it feels today.“I find myself glued to [the coverage],” said Karen Curtner, who was the principal at Westside during the shooting. “My husband’s like, ‘Why are you watching that? Don’t watch that.’ But what I find is … and I don’t know why I do this, but I try to figure out, I guess, some type of common denominator among all of these. That’s what I try to do. I analyze it, and I think, ‘What would cause a person to want to do that?’”She’s not alone. Many Jonesboro survivors say they have obsessed over the details of shootings in other cities, looking at those tragedies as they still try to understand their own. Johnson and Golden have never explained exactly why they did what they did — a detail that has made finding a sense of closure much harder, if closure for something like this even really exists. ***When it happened, the shooting ranked as one of the worst in the country’s history and the worst ever attack on a middle school, according to the FBI. Jonesboro, situated about 130 miles northeast of Little Rock, was inundated by media from all over the world, overwhelming the small city of some 50,000.Located on the rural outskirts of town, amid rolling wooded hills that open up into flat farm fields of cotton and wheat, Westside suddenly found its parking lot crammed with satellite trucks. Producers from syndicated talk shows tried to sneak into the hospital rooms of survivors; reporters staked out funerals.The idea that two baby-faced kids whose lives had barely begun had chosen to commit such a coldblooded and adult crime was a shocking and unimaginable concept — until a little over a year later, when Harris and Klebold, high school seniors, shot and killed 13 people and injured more than 20 others at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.After Columbine, Jonesboro slowly began to fade from the national spotlight. The white ribbons people tied on tree trunks in memory of the dead have long ago frayed and vanished. At Westside, where the school looks largely the same as it did 20 years ago, there is a stone bench out front carved with the date — “Mar. 24 1998” — and a small memorial in the shape of a sundial in a park area behind the building, near the sidewalks that were once stained with the blood of the fallen.Engraved on the sundial are the victims’ names: Natalie Brooks, 12; Paige Herring, 12; Stephanie Johnson, 12; Britthney Varner, 11; and Shannon Wright, 32.“Most of the kids who are here now have no idea what happened, what any of this means. They weren’t even alive,” a Westside teacher said on a recent Thursday afternoon after school had let out. “And to be honest, we don’t talk about it much either.”That’s because the community has tried to move on. As at Columbine and Sandy Hook, the anniversary of the shooting was formally marked the first year or two. There was a ceremony around the flagpole in front of Westside to mark the five-year mark. Since then, the date has largely passed without mention, except for informal gatherings of family members and survivors — a decision encouraged by people who believed that moving forward was ultimately the best kind of healing for a town that had suffered so much.But it is a tragedy that has quietly endured in ways that are not always so obvious — through the unimaginable loss still felt by parents and families of the children who were killed, the trauma and guilt that still plague the teachers, students and other survivors and other pain that has rippled in unusual ways through the community.Everybody has a story — the responding paramedics and hospital staffers who were later diagnosed with PTSD, the counselors who tended to the victims who later needed counselors of their own to cope with what they’d heard, the teachers who walked away from the classroom forever because they couldn’t get past a sense of fear or guilt that they had been unable to protect their students from a threat that was not even near the top of the list of bad things that people here believed could happen.“When we thought of safety back then, it was things like making sure that the playground was equipped with safety features,” said Curtner, the former Westside principal, who is now an assistant superintendent at Nettleton Public Schools, also in Jonesboro. “We never thought about people hurting other people. I guess I was naive.”After the shooting, the parents of at least one child killed split up. Others took their surviving children and left town, trying to forge a new start in a new home and at a new school — though for some, it caused more anguish being in a community where there was no one to talk to about what they had been through. Some turned to alcohol or drugs to ease the pain. Others touched by the shooting have suffered serious health problems or died years before they were expected to, developments other survivors attribute to the enormous stress of what they went through. The children who lived through the attack are now adults with their own kids, and though many have been able to deal with the aftermath of that day much better than the grownups, some have told reporters about the fear they have felt in sending their own kids off to school, a place that no longer seems safe.Many of the families and survivors no longer talk to reporters. Along with concerns about Johnson and Golden, some say the subject is too painful to talk about after all these years. Many are still angry at the media about how they were treated in the aftermath of the shooting. And others say they don’t want to be accused of trying to seek some kind of attention for themselves when some in the community have constantly urged them to “move on.”After initially refusing to speak to the media or anyone else about what she had been through, in part because of survivor guilt, Thetford eventually saw the questions as a gift from God to lift the pain and burden she felt. She began speaking to reporters and at churches. After Columbine, she traveled to Littleton, where she met with survivors and others who were on the scene, including police officers, trying to ease their pain by sharing her own. As more acts of violence happened, she reached out to other victims of mass shootings, trying to offer comfort.“I’ve written places and offered to come because when you hear about something like that, the first thing you want to do is put your arms around them and hug them,” she said. “That’s the first thing that comes to my mind is I just want to hold them and tell them it won’t ever be OK, but it’ll get better.”***Thetford knows she was one of the lucky ones, which comes with guilt all its own. She lived. After the hospital, she came home to her husband and her kids. And every year, it is she who takes a ski vacation with her family, who gets to hold her grandkids close and see them grow up. It is she who will finally retire this year, after nearly four decades as an educator, having refused to let one terrible day take away the job she had dreamt of doing since she was a little girl. “I count my blessings every day because I’ve been so fortunate,” Thetford said. But her life since has been anything but easy.She still remembers the little details of that of that day, playing them over again and again in her mind. It was the second day back in class after spring break. Her husband had hit a deer with her old Monte Carlo earlier that morning, leaving a huge dent in the front. It was her dream car, and as she drove to work, she was upset. As she said hello to the secretaries in the front office, one asked her how she was doing. “The day can’t get much worse,” she replied.Today, Thetford cringes at the remark. “I have not said that since,” she said.Before class, she ran into her friend Shannon Wright, a sixth-grade English teacher who was one of the youngest on staff. Married with a 2-year-old son, she was showing off pictures of her family’s trip to Disney World the week before. “They were so bright and beautiful,” Thetford recalled.When the fire alarm began blaring shortly after 12:30 p.m., a student told Thetford she thought she had seen Golden pull the alarm and run out the back door. Thetford was annoyed at the disruption. But she decided to do the drill anyway. Grabbing her grade book, she began walking her students down the hall toward the back exit. Along the way, she thought about Golden, who was one of her students. Thetford knew him and his parents well. His older sister had been in the first class she’d ever taught, and she’d also taught his brother, who was the same age as her son. Andrew, she thought, “is gonna be in so much trouble for pulling that fire alarm.”Thetford was the first person out the back door into the warm sunshine. She began going down her class list, checking off the kids’ names. Around her, the yard was getting crowded with other students who had evacuated. That’s when she heard the first pops. It sounded like firecrackers, and she thought it was an ill-advised attempt to frighten the kids, perhaps to encourage them to take emergency drills more seriously. “What in the world is administration thinking?” Thetford thought.Suddenly, Thetford began seeing students collapse around her, and she realized they were being shot at. Dropping her grade book, she began to frantically wave her arms. “Get down! Get down!” she screamed at those around her. Within seconds, she felt a “whoosh,” followed by horrific pain. She fell prone to the ground. On the sidewalk, she saw a little girl to her left. She had been shot in the head. “I knew she was dead,” Thetford said. Before she could come to grips with what she’d seen, she felt hands grabbing her and picking her up, taking her out of the line of fire.Curtner came out the front door of the school. As she walked around the side of the building, she saw kids running in terror and others who were hurt and bleeding on the ground, including Thetford. She heard a series of pops.For a second, she panicked. The school had practiced for fires, tornadoes and natural disasters. But they had never prepared for anything like this. They had no lockdown plan or security guard to protect them. “Schools were the safest place to be,” she said. “You never thought of needing anything like that. It was unheard of.”The security doors leading back into the school were locked, a fire protection feature triggered by the alarm, so the principal began herding panicked kids and teachers toward the gym next door. Bullets were still flying, until suddenly the shooting just stopped. With little time to think, Curtner ran back to the front entrance, which was unlocked, and began racing through the classrooms grabbing giant buckets and supplies, including medical kits that they had prepared months earlier when scientists suggested a giant earthquake might hit the middle of the country.She had no idea the crucial role those earthquake kits would play in another kind of disaster. Police and ambulances took more than 15 minutes to arrive at the school on the edge of town, and the kits were credited with saving the lives of several of the severely injured.As ambulances arrived to transport the wounded, Curtner knew there were kids that didn’t make it. Nothing in her life had prepared her for what she saw as she ran around trying to assist. She tries not to think about it, but the images linger like a bad dream.From the moment she began training to be a teacher, it had been drilled into her that she was responsible for keeping the kids in her care safe. If she could have stopped the bullets, she would have, but she hadn’t, and for that, she felt like a failure. But the pain and depression she would ultimately feel would only come much later. At that moment, she had the burden of taking on what needed to be done, of being the pillar of strength her kids and teachers needed.Only when the police stopped Curtner and asked her to look through a list of students to mark who had been absent that day did she begin to wonder who had attacked her school. She wondered if it was a disgruntled parent or some mentally ill lunatic. But she checked off who had been out of school that day, a list that included Johnson and Golden.“We’ve got these two in custody out in the car,” the officer told her, pointing to the boys’ names.“For what?” she said.Curtner didn’t get it, even when the officer told her Johnson and Golden had been found with the guns. And when it hit her, she couldn’t believe it. Later, people would ask her if the boys had been troublemakers, if there had been signs of instability or hints that they would become killers. Johnson had been in trouble, but nothing out of the ordinary for a boy his age. Even now, she remembers how unfailingly polite he was — always “Yes, ma’am” and “No, ma’am.” And she’d never even seen Golden in the office. “Not one time,” she said. She could not believe them capable of murder.She knew their parents. The Goldens, who worked in the post office, had been involved with the school and seemed like good people. She was still thinking about it when Dennis Golden, Andrew’s father, rushed through the front door looking for his son.“He thought he was coming to pick his child up. He’s like, ‘I can’t find my kid. Where’s my kid?’” Curtner recalled. “I remember them taking him in my office, and I remember the look on his face.”Like Curtner, he was stunned.***The next few months were, according to Curtner, “a blur.” In a decision that perhaps wouldn’t be made today, classes resumed at Westside that Friday, three days after the shooting. The school administration, acting on the advice of counselors, had made the call in the belief that getting the kids back on a schedule would allow them to find “normalcy.”The school had brought in high-pressure hoses to wash the blood away and tried to patch up bullet holes that had pierced the school building and the gym. They would ultimately bulldoze some of the trees where Golden and Johnson had set up their sniper’s nest and install fences designed to keep the grounds more secure, but that wouldn’t happen until later. Inside, the fire alarm had been temporarily deactivated, amid fears that a false alarm might send school into panic.Some of the students didn’t return in those early days, but many did, even though that Friday also happened to be the day that many of the funerals were held. In every classroom, the state had assigned a counselor to encourage the kids to talk about their feelings, though many struggled to, or preferred talking only to teachers who, like them, had been there and could relate to what they were going through.Nothing was normal. A police officer had been assigned to the building 24 hours a day, guarding what had become a macabre tourist attraction. Every day, there was more mail to open in what was an unbelievable outpouring of support. There were letters, teddy bears, school supplies and boxes of other gifts meant to help the school feel important. In classes, kids were assigned to write thank-you cards. It was just a struggle to get through each day.“We just survived, pretty much,” Curtner said.The following school year was trickier. Some of the teachers didn’t return — though after months of rehabilitation, Thetford did. She was happy to be back, happy to see her kids, but like every part of the journey after the shooting, it wasn’t easy. Many days, she spent time after school talking to Curtner and the other teachers in what became informal therapy sessions where they talked about the emotions and fears.There were days when some of the staff couldn’t get out of bed because they were so depressed or full of anxiety. A few teachers admitted to thoughts of suicide. Thetford struggled with feeling guilty that she had survived while her friend Shannon Wright, who had taken two bullets while trying to shield her students, had died. And at one of her lowest points, Thetford told her mother, “I don’t understand why Shannon got to die, and I stayed here.” She was diagnosed with severe clinical depression.That fall, the school was required to hold a fire drill. Some students and teachers decided to stay home rather than risk flashbacks. But Thetford knew she had to face her fears. Before the bell went off, she recalled how the new superintendent of the school district had approached her and grabbed her hand. “Mrs. Thetford, we’ll protect you,” he said.“I thought, ‘No, he won’t. Nobody can protect you from things like that,’” she recalled.While every day was a struggle, Thetford was determined to stick it out with her students. Instead of sixth-grade social studies, she was teaching the seventh graders, to allow her more contact with those who had been in school that day. She loved teaching history, she loved the school and she believed things would get easier. “To get me out of here, you’d have to blast me out,” she told a colleague.But one day, she was pulling a clip of World War I for a lesson. She wanted to teach the kids about trench warfare, but she couldn’t bear to watch the film clip, because of the violence. How could she do her job without a visual? “I started crying,” she said. “That’s when I knew I’d have to get out of social studies.”When the seventh-grade class that year moved on to the high school, Thetford took a job as a reading teacher at Nettleton and eventually went back to school to become a librarian. For her part, Curtner stayed with the kids, becoming principal of Westside High School, a job she kept until that class graduated. In a move that surprised her colleagues, she took a job as principal at the local high school for troubled youths. Explaining the move, she says she felt she could “make a difference.” But she also admits she felt she needed a change, and to deal with kids who had disciplinary issues felt easier than staying at Westside.“I left that burden there,” she said. Moving to another school “took my mind off of it, and it was a saving thing for me.”***Frustrated by the secrecy of the juvenile court proceedings and the indication that the two boys who killed their kids would serve just a few years in prison, the victims’ families approached a prominent lawyer named Bobby McDaniel shortly after the shooting to ask if he thought there was any other avenue of justice.Regarded as one of the best civil litigators in the state, McDaniel had made national news just two years earlier as the lawyer for Susan McDougal, one of Bill Clinton’s partners in the Whitewater land venture. McDaniel had forced the sitting president to sit for a deposition in a fraud case related to the failed real estate deal.For him, taking the case was personal. Jonesboro was his hometown, and like everyone else he was horrified by what had happened. Nobody was in it for the money — except to prevent the boys from perhaps someday selling their stories or profiting off the crime. While the Golden family reportedly did pay an undisclosed amount of money to some of the victims’ families, what McDaniel and the parents really wanted was information. How could they stop something like this from ever happening to anyone again?In 1998, McDaniel filed a wrongful death suit — naming Johnson and Golden as defendants, along with Sporting Goods Properties, the manufacturer of a Remington 742 rifle that was used by Johnson in the attack, arguing the gun was a risk because it didn’t have a trigger lock. While the gun company was later dropped from the case, in part because the guns were stolen, the attorney still said they had been successful, pointing to the increased presence of trigger locks that gun makers began to add to weapons amid worries of liability after what happened in Jonesboro.“Every time you go into a gun store, every gun on a rack has a trigger lock on it. That was not the case when we filed this lawsuit,” McDaniel said.But it took years to realize the other part of the case: trying to understand what made Johnson and Golden attack their school that day. It was nearly two years before he got to question the boys for the first time back in 2000 — testimony that was limited because they were still juveniles and Golden had filed an appeal to overturn his conviction, claiming he had been insane at the time of the shooting.Then McDaniel had to wait again until the boys were out of prison. Because they had been held as juveniles, there was no reporting on their exact release or where they had gone. It took nearly a decade after the shooting to track them down and complete the depositions. It was another nine years before they were made public this past August — more than 19 years after the shooting.“It was a long, long process, but as I told the families, and I maintained, the consequences of this case are gonna last lifetimes,” McDaniel said. “So what if we have to wait seven years, 10 years, 20 years. I will not abandon ship just because it’s gonna take a long time.”The videos feel extraordinary — not so much for the answers they provide, but rather because they exist at all in a case that for years was marked by silence. It is rare to see killers speaking under oath about their crimes, even if some of the testimony offered by Johnson and Golden is hard to believe, including claims made by both that they had shot at the sky, not at people.There are four separate videos of close to nine hours of testimony. Two of Johnson, one taken in 2000, when he was 15; and another in 2007, when he was 22 and soon to be on his way back to jail after being pulled over in a van with marijuana and an unregistered gun. (Johnson said it was a Christmas gift from a friend worried about his safety.) And two of Golden, one taken in 2000, when he was 13; and another in 2008, when he was 22. By then, Golden had changed his name to Drew Grant in an attempt to “start a new life,” he explained. McDaniel tracked him down after his failed attempt to get a concealed weapons license.In the 2008 video, Golden appears nervous and uneasy. He talks about going to live with his sister in Missouri to change his name and start over and how he once stayed with a pastor of his parents to stay under the radar after his release. He had been taking classes at Arkansas State in Jonesboro under his new name and had been working odd jobs and relying heavily on his parents, who had bought him a truck and were paying for most of his expenses. He had gotten a single tattoo since he had left jail: a cross with the words “Roman 3:23.” When McDaniel asked which Bible verse it was, Golden mumbled, “For all who have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.”Golden speaks of remorse, but never says he is sorry. He testified that he had never apologized or reached out to his victims on the advice of his lawyers and because he “didn’t want to stir anything up.” He delivers pages of testimony about his skills as an expert marksman, the awards he won as a child. But when asked about the shooting at Westside, he repeatedly testified he shot into the air or aimed at the gym, away from people, even though ballistics show bullets from his gun hit Thetford and killed Brooks, among others. It sparked a tense exchange with McDaniel, who, off camera, sounds increasingly incredulous.Golden: “I didn’t ever intentionally shoot anyone.”McDaniel: “That’s a lie, and you know it, isn’t it?”Golden: “No, sir. I never aimed at anyone.”McDaniel: “Oh, it’s purely coincidental that five people lay dead with bullets through their head and their hearts by pure accident, right?”Golden: “I never intended to. I never shot at anybody. I didn’t.”McDaniel: “Do you know what perjury is?”But in a haunting moment, Johnson was asked during his 2007 deposition if he has read about the shootings that have come after Jonesboro, including the attack at Columbine, and what advice he might have to stop future killers like him. After a moment, he responded at length, speaking somewhat dispassionately about the warning signs to look for.“If a person is normally active, a person is doing well in school and not having problems, and he just all the sudden clamps up, don’t want to talk, getting in trouble; obviously that’s a warning sign,” Johnson said. “Deviant behavior, running with the wrong crowd … that’s a bad thing. It is. People who are physically violent and don’t get counseling for it and don’t talk about it, don’t talk about their problems period, stuff boils over, you know.”In the closest answer to a reason given by either one of the boys, Johnson added, “I think that was the main reason why. If there was any reason, that was the main reason why I decided to help Andrew do what he done, do we what done. I felt like I didn’t have anyone to talk to. I didn’t have anyone to open up to. I didn’t know who I could trust.”According to public records, Johnson lives in Houston. Golden got married last year and lives outside Cape Girardeau, Mo. Neither one has ever personally apologized to their victims.“I am incapable of expressing to you the stress, anxiety, frustration, and anger that these parents have that somebody who burglarizes a home, for example, or sells crack cocaine can get 40 years in prison, and these guys were out walking the street in virtually no time,” McDaniel said. “Just like we can’t lock up the drug problem — they tried that and it hadn’t worked — and locking these kids up for 100 years would be great at least in the eyes of the parents, but I don’t know the solution. There’s no answer that will remove their hurt, anger and frustration.”***On that warm day in February earlier this year, when Lynette Thetford felt all the pain and memories coming back, she excused herself from her desk at the Nettleton Junior High library and took a 15-minute drive back to Westside, down that winding road she has traveled so often over the past 20 years. She’s come here alone often or visited some of the students she lost at the cemetery up the street. But this time, she brought one of her assistants, a close friend who has seen her through dark times just like this one. She wanted to tell her the story of what happened that day.As much as it hurts and will hurt, talking about it helps, crying about it helps. That’s what she tells other survivors of mass shootings and families who have lost loved ones. If Thetford had learned anything, it’s that keeping it all inside, bottled up, just doesn’t work.When they got to the school, they walked down that sidewalk, where she was shot, where she saw little girls who had their whole lives before them cut down in an instant. She pointed to where the boys were, to where her friend Shannon Wright died protecting her students. She showed her the place where colleagues carried her out of the line of fire, where she lay on the ground, her colleagues plugging her wound and yelling at her to hang on.There were so many thoughts going through her mind in those minutes after the shooting, weird ones that today she cannot explain. Was her house clean? Why had she just eaten that apple and banana for lunch instead of something better if that was going to be her last meal? As the minutes passed, she was more and more certain she was going to die right there. Wasn’t this the way it always was in the westerns she liked to watch. A bullet in the gut was deadly.She worried about her husband and her kids and how she hadn’t been able to say goodbye to her parents. As she felt herself begin to slip out of consciousness, she saw that bright light people are always talking about. She was sure it was heaven. But something seemed to hold her back. Something in her heart told her she had to forgive whoever it was that did this to her and to her school. She had no idea who had fired those shots, but there on the ground she willed herself to forgive. She wouldn’t be a Christian if she only followed part of what Jesus said.“I didn’t know it was the boys,” she recalled. “I was expecting big men in camo to come running around with the big guns in their hands. I never thought it was the kids. That was one of the biggest surprises.”Thetford later woke up in the hospital. God, it seems, wasn’t done with her yet. The doctor told her she’d lost two 2-liter Coke bottles full of blood. She was lucky to be alive. Someone finally told her who had fired the guns. Andrew Golden and Mitchell Johnson. She thought of her deal with God. She had to forgive, and she had to keep forgiving.Maybe that’s how a few weeks later she found herself comforting Golden’s parents, listening to his mother cry about how her baby was in jail downtown, so close, and she couldn’t hug him or hold him. The boy who had shot and nearly killed her. “I just cried. I cried with them,” she said.This post was originally published on Yahoo News."

Tom Wolf (D) vetoed an aggressive and highly restrictive 20-week abortion ban on Monday. “I just vetoed the most restrictive anti-choice bill in the country because PA women don’t need Harrisburg politicians making their health care decisions,” Wolf tweeted on Monday alongside a photo of him vetoing the bill. The legislation would have also criminalized a procedure called “dilation and evacuation” (D&E), which is the most common type of second trimester abortion procedure. D&E bans are a frequent tactic in the anti-abortion movement, often used to limit a woman’s options when seeking an abortion. SB3 referred to D&Es as “dismemberment abortion.” The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists opposes D&E bans, writing in a December 2015 statement that these restrictions “represent legislative interference at its worst.” “Efforts to ban specific types of procedures will limit the ability of physicians to provide women with the medically appropriate care they need, and will likely result in worsened outcomes and increased complications,” the statement reads. “These legislative efforts are based on non-medical, subjective language. This language will create confusion, thus putting women at risk and, in certain cases, actually leading to abortion later in pregnancy.” Greg Manz, a spokesman for the Republican Party of Pennsylvania, called Wolf a “puppet” of Planned Parenthood after the governor vetoed SB3 Monday afternoon. “Tom Wolf is a puppet of Planned Parenthood, the nation’s number one provider of abortions, and is going to gladly accept their special-interest money for more political favors,” Manz said.Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards applauded Wolf’s move in a statement on Monday. “This bill would threaten women’s safety and punish doctors for using their best medical judgment,” Richards said. “As recent events in Pennsylvania show, it’s essential that we continue to elect champions who will protect women’s access to safe, legal abortion. Each of us deserves the opportunity to control our lives at the most basic level: our bodies, our families, and our life’s path, including whether and when to become a parent.”"

According to Virginia law, the winner will now be determined by drawing “lots” ― a process such as drawing straws, flipping a coin or picking names from a hat.Previously:After a tense recount in a single race on Tuesday, Republicans looked set to lose their 17-year hold on Virginia’s House of Delegates and enter an unpredictable new era of shared power with Democrats.The recount showed Democratic candidate Shelly Simonds ahead by one vote against Republican incumbent David Yancey in the state’s District 94, the Virginian-Pilot reported. Election officials in Newport News reviewed nearly 24,000 ballots on Tuesday.The results still had to be finalized on Wednesday by judges on the Newport News Circuit Court. Yancey challenged the result early on Wednesday, with his campaign claiming that a ballot that should have been counted for him had not been counted, a Republican official told The Virginian-Pilot. With Simonds’ win, the House of Delegates would shift from a 51-49 Republican majority to a 50-50 split, which means Republicans and Democrats must share power. It would be the first time in nearly two decades that the GOP doesn’t control the state’s lower legislative chamber.That 51-49 split was already a dramatic narrowing of the GOP’s margin. Before the Nov. 7 elections, Republicans had held a 66-34 majority in the House. People following the wild recount on Tuesday remarked on Twitter that the one-vote victory was a stark reminder that every single vote counts.Local reporters in Virginia tweeted the recount minute by minute, as the tallies rolled in and the Republicans’ majority seemed more and more likely to topple.Virginia Democrats had filed for recounts in four tight races in November, including a challenge to what appeared to be Yancey’s win by a mere 10 votes, The Washington Post reported.In another contested race ― in which Republican Bob Thomas seems to have defeated Democrat Joshua Cole by a margin of 82 votes ― state officials said some voters received the wrong ballots. If the upcoming recount for that contest goes to Cole, Democrats could win majority control of the House of Delegates.Last month’s elections ushered in a series of historic wins for Democrats across the country, including Virginia electing its first openly transgender state lawmaker, Democrat Danica Roem.“This is the 16th seat flipped from red to blue in the Virginia House this year,” Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez said in a statement on Tuesday evening, adding. “Simply put, every vote counts.” Samuel Levine contributed reporting.

Tim Kaine (D-Va.) for details on taxpayer-funded settlements paid out on behalf of senators or staff members accused of sexual harassment.Susan Tsui Grundmann, executive director of the office that responds to workplace misconduct complaints in Congress, told Kaine there may be inaccurate or incomplete records regarding the number of claims filed or why cases resulted in settlement, so she did not want to provide any of it.″[T]he OOC does not possess reliable information regarding the number of sexual harassment claims that have been filed or settled, the identities or positions of the individuals alleged to have committed sexual harassment, or why the parties reached settlements,” Grundmann said.Here’s a copy of the letter.Kaine wrote to the office on Dec. 6 asking how many harassment claims had been filed in the last decade, the number filed against members of the Senate or their staffs that ended in “some form of resolution,” and the amount of each settlement paid with taxpayer funds.Kaine had planned to make the information public. “If Congress truly wants to fix a broken system, we need to understand the scope of the problem,” Kaine said in a Monday night statement. “I’m disappointed the OOC didn’t release any information to help us do that. I’m going to keep pushing for public release of this data and working on reforms that help prevent harassment and assault.”Grundmann’s decision to deny Kaine’s request is strange given that, earlier this month, her office provided the House Administration Committee with details on taxpayer-funded settlements paid out in the House ― one day after the committee made its request.That data showed the House had paid out six settlements since 2013, including an $84,000 sexual harassment claim against Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Texas). He reportedly told a female aide she could “show her nipples whenever she wanted to,” and said he had “sexual fantasies” and “wet dreams” about another female aide. He is still in Congress, for some reason.Kaine’s push for transparency comes amid a wave a sexual harassment scandals on Capitol Hill. Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) announced he will resign in response to allegations against him. Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) already resigned. Farenthold and Rep. Ruben Kihuen (D-Nev.), also hit with sexual misconduct allegations, have said they won’t seek re-election next year.Some lawmakers have responded by demanding an overhaul of Congress’ secretive process for handling sexual harassment claims. Others are anxiously awaiting the next bombshell news report to take down one of their colleagues.People are “freaking out,” said one Democratic staffer on the Hill said."

In a late November letter to congressional party leaders, GOP Reps. Dave Reichert (Wash.), Brian Fitzpatrick (Pa.), Ryan Costello (Pa.), Patrick Meehan (Pa.), Mark Sanford (S.C.) and Carlos Curbelo (Fla.) ― and six of their colleagues ― said the refuge, also known as ANWR, “stands as a symbol of our nation’s strong and enduring natural legacy.”“Any development footprint in the refuge stands to disrupt this fragile, critically important landscape,” the group wrote to House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). But on Tuesday, Reichert, Fitzpatrick, Costello, Meehan, Sanford and Curbelo all voted in favor of the final tax proposal. The bill includes a provision, introduced by Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), that would require Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to approve at least two lease sales for drilling — each covering no less than 400,000 acres — in the refuge’s coastal plain area. This 1.5 million acre region in northeast Alaska, also know as the 1002 Area, is home to polar bears, moose and caribou, and it has been the subject of a decades-long battle between energy companies and conservationists. The other six signers of the letter — Reps. Frank LoBiondo (N.J.), Chris Smith (N.J.), Dan Donovan (N.Y.), Elise Stefanik (N.Y.), John Faso (N.Y.) and Leonard Lance (N.J.) — were among the 12 House Republicans who voted against the final tax bill. In a statement last week, Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) had dismissed Republican opposition to opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to energy development as “half-hearted” at best.“It is now clear that the letter from twelve House Republicans opposing drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge was pure posturing,” she wrote. “If these Republicans want to stop their party from turning the refuge into an oilfield, they should vote no. Lip service won’t protect the Arctic.”The letter did not specifically mention Murkowski’s measure. However, in an accompanying statement, Costello had urged Congress not to include changes to the refuge in the tax plan. Ultimately, that didn’t stop him and the others from voting in support of that massive legislation. Described by some as “America’s Serengeti,” the refuge covers more than 19 million acres in northeastern Alaska. Scientists, environmentalists and a bipartisan group of former Interior Department officials have warned that fossil fuel extraction there could spoil the landscape and harm the species that call it home.The Trump administration’s fiscal 2018 budget, released earlier this year, called for allowing oil and gas drilling in the coastal plain. In May, Zinke signed an order to “jump-start Alaskan energy production.” He said at the time that the move was an “important first step in a smart and measured approach to energy development in ANWR.” The Congressional Budget Office estimates the ANWR provision would generate slightly more than $1 billion in federal revenue over the next decade — a figure that has been widely disputed. Within the drilling leases, the measure allows for 2,000 acres of the coastal plain to be developed above ground with wells and support facilities.The Senate is expected to vote on the final tax bill later on Tuesday.

And some of them had ― I think these were the initials ― at the bottom of their photograph ‘DRR’ — directors’ rights respected.“In other words, ‘If you give me a job, you can have sex with me.’ That was commonplace for people who proposed that they should be a victim. Madness.”McKellen, who is gay, called Kevin Spacey’s coming-out in response to misconduct allegations “reprehensible.” He expressed hope that predatory behavior could be “eradicated.”“I assume nothing but good will come out of these revelations, even though some people of course get wrongly accused — there’s that side of it as well,” he said.McKellen’s comments last month are coming to light after the Daily Mail posted an article about them. Many of his remarks on sexual harassment occur after the 41:45 mark in the video above."

The steel structure, which was officially dedicated on Sunday, attempts to encapsulate the hope, beauty and light that emerges when people of different beliefs and values come together. The location of the Lighthouse is particularly striking. New Haven’s Town Green has a history that dates back to the 1640s, when Puritan settlers first landed in the area to establish a commonwealth based on their strict religious doctrines and practices. The Puritans planned to build New Haven in nine roughly equal squares, with the Town Green and a meetinghouse at the center. The layout was reportedly inspired by the Bible.But Kathleen Green, the YHC’s executive director, said she hopes people of all faiths ― and no faith ― will cherish the Lighthouse. In particular, she hopes the Lighthouse will be a source of comfort and community for secular people who feel excluded during the holiday season.“We want this to be symbolic, a lighthouse for people who feel a little left out at this time of year with different seasonal displays that don’t represent them in any way,” Green told HuffPost. “We think of a lighthouse as a beacon of warmth and in this case, a beacon of community that lets people know that you’re part of this community, whether you’re religious or not ― wherever you fall on the spectrum, you are part of this community.”The project took more than two years to come to fruition. The YHC’s previous executive director, Chris Stedman, initiated the plan. Stedman, a humanist writer and interfaith activist who now lives in Minnesota, said the idea came to him as he was walking through the Town Green in 2015, admiring how the Christmas and Hanukkah displays brought light to a season of darkness and created opportunities for people to gather together. He realized then that this was an opportunity for New Haven’s humanists to share their own beliefs. Some secular groups have focused their efforts on trying to take down religious displays from public spaces. Others put up displays that mock religion or religious people. When this happens, Stedman said he sees it as a missed opportunity to show others what secular people actually do believe.“I actually think atheist and agnostic and humanist and other non-religious people have a contribution to make to the public discourse on ethics and values,” he told HuffPost. “I would love to see more secular folk articulating their values and talking about what they do believe in, what matters to them.”Stedman pointed out that a large number of Americans still view atheists unfavorably. About half of Americans (51 percent) say they would be less likely to support an atheist candidate for president, compared to other traits like having an extramarital affair or being a Muslim.“I think a lot of people don’t understand atheist, agnostic, secular and other folk very well,” Stedman said. “So I think when we have the opportunity to contribute something and help people have a better understanding of our values, it’s worth taking.” After launching the project in 2015, the YHC raised funds online and from donors in the New Haven community. The group also put out a call for artists to submit their designs. The winning design by Salmon features images of people coming together in different neighborhoods in New Haven. When night falls, the Lighthouse glows from within. In the future, the YHC hopes to raise enough money to make the Lighthouse interactive, so that it shines brighter as more people gather around it. Green said the Lighthouse is meant to complement, instead of overshadow, the other displays in the town square.“YHC is hopeful that our having a seasonal sculpture alongside religious symbols on the Town Green will be an inspiration to other communities,” she told HuffPost. “Rather than choose divisiveness, we are choosing to be a part of the wider community by contributing to the display. We hope others will consider doing the same.”"

She acknowledged that Trump’s privately owned businesses would likely receive major tax cuts.“There are a number of provisions that would negatively impact the president personally,” Sanders said again, after more questions, and again without elaboration.The American public cannot determine exactly how Trump would benefit from the tax bill because of his ongoing refusal to release his tax returns. Sanders brought out the same old dodge on Tuesday, saying that he can’t disclose his financial information because “the president’s taxes are still under audit.”This is false. The IRS has affirmed that “nothing prevents individuals from sharing their own tax information.”In January, President-elect Trump also claimed that “the only one that cares about my tax returns are the reporters.”"

Oprah Winfrey, Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon and newcomer Storm Reid all star in director Ava DuVernay’s film adaptation of Madeleine L’Engle’s science-fiction classic.“Change is coming. Stay tuned,” Witherspoon captioned a photo of the cover on her Instagram account. Kaling wrote, “Watch out 2018.” Reid, who is 14, dedicated the powerful cover to her grandmother, writing, “This one is for my grandma in heaven Hazel Lorraine Richmond R.I.P. You were always a rebel and a true warrior.” In the accompanying magazine article, DuVernay spoke to Time about what it was like bringing the beloved book to the big screen. “I wasn’t just casting for actresses. I was casting for leaders — icons,” she said. “Reese is the hottest producer in town. Oprah’s the most prolific, venerable legend of television and an artist and entrepreneur. And Mindy’s one of the few women running a show with her name, about her. When I think about the three of them together as a unit of celestial beings, it feels right.” Diversity in skin color, size, faith and age was also a major casting focus, DuVernay told Time. The director said she wanted Mrs. Which, Mrs. Whatsit and Mrs. Who ― played by Winfrey, Witherspoon and Kaling, respectively ― to be “black, white and someone who wasn’t either,” and Meg ― the main character, played by Reid ― “to have brown skin.” In a interview with Entertainment Weekly earlier this year, DuVernay said she wanted “to place a brown girl in that role of Meg, a girl traveling to different planets and encountering beings and situations that I’d never seen a girl of color in.” DuVernay’s casting decisions had an effect on Witherspoon, who told Time she’d “never seen somebody demand inclusiveness like that.” “It’s just a different perspective, and you don’t get that unless we start to have powerful filmmakers of different colors, different genders,” she said. “You’re just gonna have the same 20 dudes making the same 20 movies over and over and over again. I looked at [DuVernay] in her jeans and sneakers and those dreads out there calling it. It’s just the coolest damn thing to watch her with those big-ass machines. It just feels like, OK, next generation: There you are.” Head to Time to read the rest of the article. “A Wrinkle In Time” hits theaters March 9."

But some of his nominees have been painfully unqualified.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a37ec7c150000490049c479.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump’s judicial nominee Matthew Petersen has withdrawn his name from consideration after a video went viral of him failing to answer basic questions about law in his confirmation hearing.“It happened,” an aide to a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee told HuffPost on Monday.The White House later confirmed the news. “Mr. Petersen has withdrawn his nomination and the President has accepted,” a White House official told HuffPost.In his letter to the president, Petersen said he’s withdrawing because he doesn’t want to be “a distraction” to the administration.“I had hoped that my nearly two decades of public service might carry more weight than my two worst minutes on television,” he said. “However, I am no stranger to political realities, and I do not wish to be a continued distraction from the important work of your Administration and the Senate.”Requests for comment from Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, also were not returned. A request for comment from Petersen was not immediately returned.Trump nominated Petersen, who is currently a member of the Federal Election Commission, to be a lifetime judge on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. But Petersen’s lack of qualifications were painfully on display last week as Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) asked him about his courtroom experience.KENNEDY: Have you ever tried a jury trial? Peterson also could not explain basic legal terms, when pressed by Kennedy.KENNEDY: As a trial judge, you’re obviously going to have witnesses. Can you tell me what the Daubert standard is? Petersen is Trump’s third district court nominee to get derailed over a lack of qualifications. Brett Talley, a 36-year-old lawyer who had never tried a case and earned a rare and unanimous “not qualified” rating by the American Bar Association, withdrew his nomination last week. Jeff Mateer, who had described transgender children as evidence of “Satan’s plan,” is not moving either.These are embarrassing setbacks to Trump’s otherwise successful push to fill up federal courts with his lifetime judges. The Senate confirmed 12 of his circuit court judges this year, more than any president has gotten in their first year since those courts were created in 1891. That’s in addition to putting Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court and getting six district court nominees confirmed.It doesn’t sound like the president cares if a few of his nominees go down. Kennedy told local news affiliate WWL-TV on Monday that Trump called him Saturday to talk about Petersen and said he agreed with Kennedy’s criticisms that his nominee wasn’t qualified.“He doesn’t interview these guys, he has his staff do it,” said the Louisiana Republican. “He said, ‘Kennedy, I think you’re right.’”Kennedy said Trump has also told him that he’s counting on senators to reject his bad judicial picks.“He has told me, ‘Kennedy, when some of my guys send someone who is not qualified, you do your job,’” the GOP senator said.This post has been updated with White House confirmation of the withdrawal and with details from Petersen’s letter."

Burke, a 44-year-old youth organizer who founded Just Be Inc., created the “Me Too” campaign in 2007, long before hashtags even existed. “I am delighted to be participating in this momentous occasion,” Burke said in a press release. “I think it’s fitting to honor the Me Too movement as we close a historic year and set our intentions for 2018. With the new year comes new momentum to fuel this work and we won’t stop anytime soon.”The #MeToo movement helped lead to the recent wave of sexual harassment and assault allegations against powerful men like Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey, Roy Moore and Louis C.K. The campaign sparked a public reckoning of how we handle sexual violence in our culture.Time Magazine named “The Silence Breakers” its “2018 Person of the Year,” citing change-makers like Burke along with actresses Ashley Judd and Alyssa Milano.“New Year’s is a time when we look at the most significant cultural and political moments of the last year, when we look for inspiration by honoring and giving a global platform to those who have made a difference,” Tim Tompkins, the president of the Times Square Alliance, said in the press release. “Tarana Burke’s courage and foresight have changed the world this year, and, we hope, forever.

Ford during a ceremony at the Naval Station Norfolk in Norfolk, Virginia. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a37f05d1600002100c50983.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In a break with two decades of military planning, President Donald Trump has eliminated climate change from his administration’s list of threats to national security.The White House’s 56-page National Security Strategy report, released Monday afternoon, included the word “climate” four times, thrice referring to business regulations and once to the environment.About one hour later, Trump vowed in a 30-minute speech to defend the nation against new threats, including “cyber and electromagnetic attacks.” He made little mention of climate change, only to list his plan to withdraw from “the very expensive and unfair Paris climate accord” as an achievement. Plugging his assault on fossil fuel regulations, he said his national security policy “embraces a future of American energy dominance and self sufficiency.” “We are declaring that America is in the game and America is going to win,” said Trump, who has previously repudiated global warming as a Chinese hoax. The report emphasized economic growth and “energy security interests.” The text’s one reference to global warming drew a distinction between “traditional pollution” and greenhouse gases, a nod to climate change deniers who dismiss planet-warming emissions like carbon dioxide as “food for plants.” “The United States will remain a global leader in reducing traditional pollution, as well as greenhouse gases, while growing its economy,” the report states. “This achievement, which can serve as model to other countries, flows from innovation, technology breakthroughs, and energy efficiency gains – not from onerous regulation.”The move dispenses with decades of Pentagon policy. It also contradicts Defense Secretary James Mattis, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford and four other former top military commanders who were quoted in the defense bill Trump signed last week saying things such as, “Climate change is a national security issue.”The announcement came nearly a week after Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act, which devotes about 870 words to the “vulnerabilities to military installations” linked to climate change over the next 20 years. The bill warns that surging global temperatures, droughts and famines can lead to more failed states ― “breeding grounds of extremist and terrorist organizations” ― and that the Air Force’s $1 billion radar installation on a Marshall Islands atoll “is projected to be underwater within two decades.”“A three-foot rise in sea levels will threaten the operations of more than 128 United States military sites, and it is possible that many of these at-risk bases could be submerged in the coming years,” the bill reads. “In the Arctic, the combination of melting sea ice, thawing permafrost, and sea-level rise is eroding shorelines, which is damaging radar and communication installations, runways, seawalls, and training areas.”The new national security report comes amid a barrage of extreme weather events that scientists say illustrate the effects of climate change. Wildfires occurring months after the usual season are raging in Southern California. Back-to-back scale-topping hurricanes wreaked havoc on Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands earlier this year. Last month, scientists announced that global fossil fuel emissions were set to hit an all-time high this year as carbon dioxide levels began surging again after staying flat for three years. In September 2016, then-President Barack Obama issued a memorandum requiring all national security policies to “fully consider the impacts of climate change.” The executive action cemented de facto policy at the Pentagon, which had begun incorporating climate change into its training and weapons testing earlier last year. The memorandum was built on a report from the National Intelligence Council, which cited heightened political tensions over diminished resources, increased migration from droughts and extreme weather, and disputes over geoengineering efforts as examples of potential security threats.But climate change became an issue for the military long before Obama took office in 2009.One of the earliest references to climate change dates back to May 1990. That month, the U.S. Naval War College issued a 73-page report, entitled “Global Climate Change Implications for the United States,” which found that “Naval operations in the coming half century may be drastically affected by the impact of global climate change.” The issue gained prominence during George W. Bush’s administration, despite the former oil tycoon president’s rejection of climate change and withdrawal from the United Nations’ Kyoto Protocol deal to curb greenhouse gas emissions. In October 2003, the National Defense University published a report warning that “global warming could have a chilling effect on the military.” “Recent evidence suggests that the oceans already may be experiencing large-scale changes that could affect Earth’s climate,” the report read. “Military planners should begin to consider potential abrupt climate change scenarios and their impacts on national defense.”That same month, the Defense Department’s Office of Net Assessment drafted a report that took a decidedly more skeptical tone, but urged immediate action: “We have created a climate change scenario that although not the most likely, is plausible, and would challenge United States national security in ways that should be considered immediately.”In 2008, the Bush administration’s National Defense Strategy report stated definitively: “[C]hanges with existing and future resource, environmental, and climate pressures may generate new security challenges …. These risks will require managing the divergent needs of massively increasing energy demand to maintain economic development and the need to tackle climate change.”Even so, the military has been faulted for not doing enough to safeguard against climate change. Last week, the Government Accountability Office, the nonpartisan auditing arm of Congress, criticized the Pentagon for exempting dozens of bases from a department-wide climate vulnerability assessment, leaving the military without any consistent data on expenses caused by extreme weather and rising seas. “As a result,” the report says, “the military services lack the information they need to adapt infrastructure at overseas installations to weather effects associated with climate change and develop accurate budget estimates for infrastructure sustainment.”The military has for years evaded partisan battles of climate change by avoiding certain phrases with Orwellian diligence. In one chapter of journalist Jeff Goodell’s new book ”The Water Will Come,” officials at the Naval Station Norfolk ― the world’s largest naval station ― admit that the bill projects to raise docks as maintenance projects without referencing sea level rise. Yet the base suffers from routine flooding even when the sun is shining, and there’s no plan to fix it, according to an InsideClimate News report. Trump’s announcement on Monday may only worsen the problem. But it’s unlikely to signal a substantive shift in military policy. The National Security Strategy report “is mostly seen as a political document with no significant influence on the government’s business,” said Francesco Femia, president of the Center for Climate and Security. “It obviously seems to be consistent with some broader political points the administration has made on climate,” Femia, whose Washington-based policy institute includes former national security advisers, told HuffPost by phone on Monday. “But it’s not consistent with what’s already going on within the administration.” “It sends an oddly contradictory signal,” he added. “It’s unfortunate.”David W. Titley, a retired rear admiral in the Navy, said there is “nothing in this document that precludes the Department of Defense from continuing to do what it’s doing.” “I really don’t see this document as some sort of declaration of war on climate or anything like that,” Titley, now a meteorology professor at Pennsylvania State University, told HuffPost by phone. “In that sense, I’m actually kind of happy. It could have been much worse.”During Trump’s speech, as he railed against past administrations for failing to confront America’s enemies more aggressively, the president made a statement that, ironically, could someday come from the mouth of a future president discussing rising seas and temperatures. “This situation should have been taken care of long before I came into office when it was easier to take care of,” Trump said."

The death toll could have been much higher if the gunmen had forced their way into the sanctuary, he said.

The death toll could have been much higher if the gunmen had forced their way into the sanctuary, he said.
