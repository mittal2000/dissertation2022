Now voters with disabilities are losing access.",2018-02-01,"<p>Kathy Hoell, second from left, joins another activist to advocate for disability rights at the state Capitol in Lincoln. Hoell helped Nebraska become a nationwide leader in voter access for people with disabilities.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a732844160000250013976e.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Matt VasilogambrosFor decades, Kathy Hoell has struggled to vote. Poll workers have told the 62-year-old Nebraskan, who uses a powered wheelchair and has a brain injury that causes her to speak in a strained and raspy voice, that she isn’t smart enough to cast a ballot. They have led her to stairs she couldn’t climb and prevented her from using an accessible voting machine because they hadn’t powered it on.“Basically,” Hoell said, “I’m a second-class citizen.”The barriers Hoell has faced are not unusual for the more than 35 million voting-age Americans with disabilities. As many jurisdictions return to paper ballots to address cybersecurity concerns — nearly half of Americans now vote on paper ballots, counted digitally or by optical scanners — such obstacles are likely to get worse.Many people with disabilities cannot mark paper ballots without assistance, so they rely on special voting machines that are equipped with earphones and other modifications. But the return to paper ballots has made poll workers less comfortable with operating machine-based systems, said Michelle Bishop, a voting rights advocate for the National Disability Rights Network. Under increasing pressure to oversee a smooth, secure election, untrained poll workers have discouraged the use of accessible voting machines, leaving voters with disabilities behind.It’s a constant complaint from voters with disabilities nationwide, Bishop said. In the last election, for example, a voter called her to report that a machine was placed in the corner, turned off, with a flower wreath hung on it.“The message is: You’re not wanted here,” Bishop said. “We get reports of poll workers discouraging their use. They say, ‘I haven’t been well trained,’ ‘It’s intimidating to me,’ ‘We’ll set it to the side and get through Election Day.’ ”Indeed, according to an October study by the Government Accountability Office, nearly two-thirds of the 137 polling places inspected on Election Day 2016 had at least one impediment to people with disabilities. In the 2008 presidential election, it was fewer than half. The GAO also reported that state inspections of voting accessibility had fallen nationally over the same time.Among the infractions: The accessible voting machine wasn’t set up and powered on, the earphones weren’t functioning, the voting system wasn’t wheelchair-accessible, or the voting system didn’t provide the same privacy as standard voting stations.Lack of access to proper voting machines, among several other issues, has led to a decline in participation, according to a survey of voters in the 2016 election by Rutgers University. Voter participation among people with disabilities has gone down over the past two presidential elections — from 57.3 percent in 2008 to 56.8 percent in 2012 and 55.9 percent in 2016.Among non-disabled Americans, voter participation also dropped between 2008 and 2012 — from 64.5 to 62.5 percent, according to the Rutgers survey. But that percentage changed little from 2012 to 2016.The Rutgers study also notes that many polling places have physical barriers, such as steep ramps and poor path surfaces, which block people with disabilities from voting. Political parties don’t target “get out the vote” efforts to people with disabilities and many of them struggle to find transportation to polling places.Other factors that contribute to the problem — such as a lack of training for poll workers, limited access to registration materials, and insufficient resources for election officials — were laid out in a September 2016 white paper from the Ruderman Family Foundation, a disability rights advocacy organization.The proliferation of voter ID laws may compound the problem, since people with disabilities are less likely to drive and to carry a photo ID.“We’re segregating in the way we vote,” Bishop said. “Separate is not equal. That’s a lesson this country should have already learned by now.”Barriers to VotingIn few places is this gap more visible than in West Virginia — a state with the highest percentage of people with disabilities, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, and one of the worst voter participation rates for people with disabilities.Just 46 percent of West Virginians with disabilities who were eligible to vote participated in the 2016 election, worse than any other state but Kentucky, at 42.5 percent, according to the Rutgers researchers. Gina Desmond, an advocate for Disability Rights of West Virginia, said the lack of access has led many people with disabilities to question their role in the democratic process.“It’s surprising how many people don’t think they have the right to vote,” Desmond said.In a predominantly rural and mountainous state, transportation options are limited, said Susan Given, the executive director of Disability Rights of West Virginia. Polling places in the state’s 55 counties are spread out and often located in outdated buildings that aren’t accessible to people with disabilities.People with disabilities who can’t get into polling places often have to vote curbside with assistance from a poll worker, Given said, robbing the voter of a private and independent ballot.The organization also gets complaints that machines for voters with disabilities often don’t work or are turned off, following a similar national pattern.Recently, Disability Rights of West Virginia hired an advocate who will visit polling places this year to see whether they are accessible. The organization also holds outreach events at high schools, psychiatric hospitals, homeless shelters and service providers to explain the voting rights of people with disabilities.Voter participation among West Virginians with disabilities did go up by 3 percentage points since the 2012 election. But, Desmond said, the state has a long way to go.Success in ColoradoIn Colorado, where 69 percent of registered voters with disabilities voted in 2016 — among the highest rates in the country — advocates and state officials have taken numerous steps to make voting accessible, according to Jennifer Levin, a senior attorney at Disability Law Colorado.In the decade following the passage of the 2002 Help America Vote Act (HAVA), Disability Law Colorado went to all 64 counties in the state, met with clerks, checked for accessibility barriers, and used state funding to help polling places meet federal HAVA and Americans with Disabilities Act standards. (Nationwide, physical barriers to voting places have steadily dropped since 2000, according to the GAO.)Now after every election, the secretary of state releases a county-by-county audit on whether localities are meeting standards for accessible polling places. After the 2016 election, for example, Denver satisfied a majority of disability access criteria, while El Paso County, home to Colorado Springs, met every one. Because of this enforcement, Levin said, accessibility shortcomings in the state are rare.In 2015, her organization again partnered with the secretary of state’s office to test five new voting machines. After collecting data, officials settled on one machine that every county will use for voters with disabilities. Now, voters can choose to use a paper ballot or an accessible machine ballot.The state’s adoption of vote-by-mail and automatic voter registration for all voters also has made it easier for people with disabilities to cast their ballots.Other states have taken similar measures. Before the 2016 election, New Hampshire adopted a new tablet-based voting system for the blind, while Rhode Island recently became the ninth state to enact automatic voter registration — which eliminates the need for people with disabilities to submit paper forms that are not accessible to them.Levin finds poll workers are still afraid of new technology. “We get complaints where a person walks in and asks to use the machine, and a worker says, ‘It doesn’t look like you need it,’ ” Levin said. “They were discouraged and intimidated by it.”City officials in Washington, D.C., said they had poll workers ask every voter whether they want to use a paper ballot or a machine, taking away any excuse for unplugged machines or untrained workers. But several polling places still fall short, according to a 2016 survey by Disability Rights DC at University Legal Services, a nonprofit advocacy organization.Some states are trying to bridge the access gap through legislation. In New York state, where the voter participation rate among people with disabilities is 48.8 percent, Senate Democrats in January introduced 13 voter-focused pieces of legislation. One bill would redesign paper ballots to be more readable. Another, written by state Sen. Michael Gianaris, would allow the distribution of voter registration forms at offices that provide services to people with disabilities, while also allowing voters to change their precinct to one whose voting systems are more accessible.“We’re looking for ways to make voting easier at a time when people are trying to make voting harder,” said Gianaris, a Queens Democrat. “Our record for voter participation is abysmal. The fight we’re having right now is to open up the process.”Hoell, now the executive director of Nebraska’s independent living council, which advocates for independent living among people with disabilities, said she was tired of facing obstacles.“Part of my way of dealing with these things is I just go to the top and start yelling,” Hoell said. After HAVA was enacted, Hoell went to John Gale, Nebraska’s secretary of state, to persuade him to invest in accessible voting machines, better train poll workers, and make polling stations compliant with federal disabilities regulations.In the years since, she said, his office has found ways to include people with disabilities in the voting process.As a result, according to the Rutgers study, Nebraska has the highest voter participation rate among persons with disabilities in the country, at more than 70 percent.

On Monday, German media described that study and another involving human subjects. Volkswagen, BMW and Daimler, the owner of Mercedes, financed the group that commissioned the studies, according to the reports.The since-dissolved European Research Group on Environment and Health in the Transport Sector commissioned the tests, which took place in Germany and the United States. According to the Times, the EUGT received all its funding from the auto companies.In one of the studies, at Germany’s Aachen University in 2013 and 2014, 25 human subjects were exposed to nitrogen dioxide for three straight hours once a week, over four weeks.The study noted that “among all nitrogen oxides, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is the most toxic one,” but that it had obtained written consent from its test subjects and was approved by the university’s ethics committee.Like the study undertaken at Aachen University, the EUGT also commissioned an experiment that forced monkeys to inhale car exhaust in 2014, according to the Times’ report.At the Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute (LRRI) in Albuquerque, New Mexico, researchers reportedly placed 10 cynomolgus macaque monkeys in airtight containers and fed them fumes from a running diesel Volkswagen Beetle to compare the fumes’ effects to those from a 1999 Ford diesel pickup. To keep the animals calm, researchers said they gave them cartoons to watch.LRRI’s president and CEO, Robert W. Rubin, said in a statement to HuffPost that the study was ultimately derailed because LRRI’s researchers didn’t know that Volkswagen had rigged its vehicles to produce emissions that were cleaner in laboratory emissions tests than on the road ― a larger scandal that has cost the company billions and has resulted a seven-year prison sentence for a former Volkswagen executive.Rubin said the study had in effect been “compromised” by Volkswagen’s modified engine and it did “not meet our standards for peer-reviewed publication.”“We understood that the EUGT organization was financially supported by automobile manufacturers, but we believed the goal of the study was to advance the scientific understanding of the effects of diesel fumes on our lungs, including the effects of new vehicle technologies that are designed to produce less pollution,” he said.The EUGT shut down last year amid controversy over its work, the Times reported.There’s been an outcry over the studies in the U.S. and Europe, where on Monday the German government spoke out against the testing.“These tests on monkeys or even people are in no ethical way justifiable and raise many critical questions about those who are behind the tests,” Steffen Seibert, a spokesman for German Chancellor Angela Merkel, said at a news conference in Berlin on Monday.All three car companies have distanced themselves from the studies and announced an investigation into EUGT’s work.“The BMW Group in no way influenced the design or methodology of studies carried out on behalf of the EUGT,” a representative for the carmaker said in a statement to HuffPost.Daimler, also in an emailed statement, described its management as “appalled” by the study and said it did not have influence over its design.Volkswagen, also in an emailed statement, issued an apology for “the inappropriate behavior” and “for the poor judgment of individuals who were involved.” The carmaker has also pledged to never test with animals again, Reuters reported.Christopher Berry, an attorney with the California-based nonprofit Animal Legal Defense Fund, told HuffPost on Wednesday that potential legal issues revolve around the engine used in the experiment. Under the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal Welfare Act, researchers are required to provide a detailed report of their precise activities involving animals to the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. That means the researchers would have had to report that the engine being used in the experiment was rigged to release cleaner emissions, instead of what was reported, he said.“Deviating from this protocol without approval would be a violation of the Animal Welfare Act,” Berry said.There’s also the issue of the experiment appearing to have no scientific purpose since the engine was rigged to produce skewed results, he said.Under the federal law, experiments using animals must “make sure that there is scientific value to the experiment,” Berry said. They also must prove that “any pain experienced by the animal is necessary for that scientific pursuit.”The state law is similar, he said.“The New Mexico animal cruelty law prohibits inflicting unjustified injury on animals, however, while there’s an exemption for animal research, that exemption does not apply if the person knowingly operated outside out of a provision in research protocol,” Berry said.Berry said his organization ― which files lawsuits to protect animals from harm and offers free legal assistance and training to prosecutors nationwide ― is looking into the case and that more needs to be done to strengthen laws that protect animals.“Regulatory agencies like the USDA often do nothing at all or at best give those organizations a slap on the wrist,” he said.Rubin defended LRRI’s work with animals in a statement, saying that in addition to the lab being certified with the USDA, all of the facility’s work involving animals is conducted under the supervision of an attending veterinarian to ensure compliance with the Animal Welfare Act and its regulations. “LRRI is committed to the humane and ethical treatment of animals involved in research,” he said.One critic of the lab and its work, however, is Dr. Catherine Willet, director of science policy at The Humane Society of the United States, who expressed alarm not only over the experiment with the Volkswagen fumes ― which she called “absolutely pointless” ― but with the number of safety incidents reported at the facility in recent years.Since March of 2015, the facility has been written up for eight noncritical incidents and five critical incidents involving animals, including dogs, pigs and non-human primates, according to inspection reports released by the USDA and reviewed by HuffPost.The incidents include employees failing to report medical issues, failing to provide proper medical treatment, failing to report procedure changes to the IACUC, and a beagle getting left outside overnight. There were also incidents of primates escaping cages, primates injuring fingers in their enclosures and being given unapproved drug combinations.There were also reports about instances that resulted in death:- In April 2016, a monkey died after the facility’s staff failed to convey its health status to a clinical veterinarian in a timely manner, according to one report.- In March of 2016, six guinea pigs died during transportation. It was later determined that they had been left too long inside an enclosure that was too densely packed and likely had a decreased air flow.- In May of 2015, an unanesthetized dog was killed when its lungs were overinflated by a technician who was neither trained to do the procedure nor directed to connect the device to the animal’s lungs. “When you’re using somebody else’s life, you need to carefully consider what it is that you’re doing with that life,” Willet said. “Especially in the case of primates that are very aware of what’s happening and very aware of their suffering and their pain. There’s a higher bar.”Kathleen Conlee, vice president of animal research issues for The Humane Society of the United States, echoed that assessment.“Lovelace clearly has a poor track record,” she told HuffPost by email. “We have continually pressed for stronger enforcement of the Animal Welfare Act. Animal suffering can’t be seen as a normal cost of doing business.” "

3,WORLD NEWS,Cape Town Slashes Daily Water Allowance But Pushes Back 'Day Zero',Nina Golgowski,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cape-town-water-limits-day-zero_us_5a731a8fe4b06fa61b4dffa9,Officials said the South African city now has until April 16 when its water taps will run dry.,2018-02-01,"Cape Town ordered its residents to slash their water usage on Thursday but pushed back ""Day Zero"" by four days.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a733dd22d00001f009436fa.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After months of pleading with residents in Cape Town, South Africa, to slash their water use, the city this week cut the daily usage limit from 23 to 13 gallons, but extended the day when most people’s taps are expected to run dry.City officials on Tuesday pushed back “Day Zero,” when tap water to businesses and residences will be completely turned off, from April 12 to April 16. The move offered some sense of hope even as the drought-stricken metropolis of nearly 4 million people scrambles to ration its dwindling water supply. “Hearing the message that says we can defeat Day Zero, more people have come onboard, and I’m glad to announce that we’ve started to move Day Zero,” said Mmusi Maimane, leader of South Africa’s Democratic Alliance party, at a press conference on Tuesday. “We anticipate that with the plan working, we can move it further along.”Maimane said in the last few days, water use has dropped from 153 million gallons per day to 143 million gallons and that the city has secured a temporary supply of 18 million gallons of water per day, for 60 days, from a dam southeast of Cape Town, according to local Eyewitness News.Maimane’s “Defeat Day Zero” campaign tweeted credit to a local farming community for providing the water.Although the four-day extension shows some progress has been made, it appears that Cape Town residents are still struggling to conserve enough water.As of Thursday ― when daily water allowances were slashed by nearly 50 percent ― roughly half of the city’s residents were not taking measures to conserve water, according to a tweet from Defeat Day Zero.That estimate is similar to figures released by the city last week, stating that only 55 percent of city residents were curbing their daily water usage to less than 23 gallons, which was then the daily limit.Last month, Cape Town reprimanded wasteful residents while warning that the crisis had “reached a point of no return.” “We can no longer ask people to stop wasting water. We must force them,” the city said while announcing a possible punitive tax on households that use more than 1,585 gallons per month.On Thursday, the city’s dams were reported to be 25.9 percent full and dropping at a rate of 1 percent each week. Once the dams reach a collective level of 13.5 percent, the city said that taps will be shut off and residents will be allocated just 6.6 gallons of water a day, which they have to line up to collect.Those living in old-age homes and care facilities will have water delivered to them in water tankers. There is public concern for vulnerable people who don’t live at such facilities or with family.A video posted to Facebook early Thursday, just after the new water limits went into effect, showed people filling up containers at a public spring and then struggling to carry them back to their cars as law enforcement officers stood by.Amanda Stergianos, a local blogger who filmed the morning bustle, asked one woman collecting water if she thought the elderly would be able to manage.“Even these young people can’t manage,” the woman replied, before sharing that she was personally collecting for two elderly individuals who couldn’t make it to the spring themselves.“One, she can hardly walk and the other is in a wheelchair. I’ve offered and now I can’t pull out,” she said.Stergianos, speaking to CNN, stressed that carrying all that water is “nearly impossible.”“I am strong and healthy, but also a single parent. Carrying 25 liters [about 6.6 gallons] of water is nearly impossible for me for more than five meters without setting it down ― let alone for long walks from the springs to the cars,” she said.Residents are reportedly not finding much relief at the stores either. Shops have been running out of bottled water as the crisis heightens, according to local reports. There has been some price gouging on the precious resource, although not at major retail chains, South Africa’s BusinessTech reported.“Under normal circumstances, demand pressure would have increased the price of the larger sizes, but instead stores have been offering specials which have cleared their shelves, even if only for a short time,” Viccy Baker of consumer watchdog Retail Price Watch told the news site.While organizations in neighboring cities have reached out to help, a potential water crisis in surrounding areas is also looming.South Africa’s Department of Water Affairs has reported that dam levels in Lesotho, a country that lies surrounded by South Africa, are similarly dropping. The dams supply the Gauteng province that includes Johannesburg, Pretoria and much of South Africa’s industry,Lesotho’s levels have been described as “very low,” which is the department’s worst ranking, Reuters wrote.Fears of similar water emergencies reportedly triggered at least one official in Johannesburg, South Africa’s largest city, to warn residents to stop sending its bottled water to Cape Town. The local official reasoned that his city has its own water shortage to worry about.“It might end up with worse situation if we carry on with this practice,” Sputnik Ratau told Eyewitness News."

Carrying 25 liters [about 6.6 gallons] of water is nearly impossible for me for more than five meters without setting it down ― let alone for long walks from the springs to the cars,” she said.Residents are reportedly not finding much relief at the stores either. Shops have been running out of bottled water as the crisis heightens, according to local reports. There has been some price gouging on the precious resource, although not at major retail chains, South Africa’s BusinessTech reported.“Under normal circumstances, demand pressure would have increased the price of the larger sizes, but instead stores have been offering specials which have cleared their shelves, even if only for a short time,” Viccy Baker of consumer watchdog Retail Price Watch told the news site.While organizations in neighboring cities have reached out to help, a potential water crisis in surrounding areas is also looming.South Africa’s Department of Water Affairs has reported that dam levels in Lesotho, a country that lies surrounded by South Africa, are similarly dropping. The dams supply the Gauteng province that includes Johannesburg, Pretoria and much of South Africa’s industry,Lesotho’s levels have been described as “very low,” which is the department’s worst ranking, Reuters wrote.Fears of similar water emergencies reportedly triggered at least one official in Johannesburg, South Africa’s largest city, to warn residents to stop sending its bottled water to Cape Town. The local official reasoned that his city has its own water shortage to worry about.“It might end up with worse situation if we carry on with this practice,” Sputnik Ratau told Eyewitness News."
5,POLITICS,ICE Chief Will ‘Never Back Down’ From Telling Undocumented Immigrants To Be Afraid,Roque Planas,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ice-thomas-homan-immigrants-afraid_us_5a723134e4b09a544b562913,Thomas Homan also lashed out against a standalone Dream Act and sanctuary cities this week.,2018-02-01,The acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement thinks people who haven't walked in his shoes have no business offering him opinions.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a7233fa2d00004900943595.jpeg?cache=CTAEZdESWe&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"SAN ANTONIO ― Thomas Homan, acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, doubled down Wednesday on his controversial comments from last year that all undocumented immigrants should be worried about getting arrested and deported under the Trump administration. “I’ll never back down on those words,” Homan said at the Border Security Expo in San Antonio, a conference that connects law enforcement with companies looking to win contracts. “If you violate the laws of this country, if you enter illegally ― which is a crime ― it’s not going to be OK anymore.”A career immigration enforcement official who started as a Border Patrol agent more than three decades ago, Homan loudly championed some of President Donald Trump’s most contentious immigration positions on Wednesday.That included the White House’s opposition to standalone legislation to grant legal status to young undocumented immigrants who have benefited from Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama administration program that Trump canceled. “If we get a clean DACA bill, shame on all of us,” Homan said.Immigrant rights groups have pressured Congress to pass a bill that would address the plight of these Dreamers, after Trump threw their tenuous legal status into jeopardy last year. But the White House has insisted that any legislation to deal with the cancellation of DACA should also include billions of dollars for Trump’s proposed border wall expansion, along with cuts to legal immigration. The impasse played a key role in the brief shutdown of the federal government earlier this month.Addressing DACA without also cracking down further on immigration would only spur more unauthorized immigration, Homan said ― even as he acknowledged that illegal crossings had plummeted to their lowest levels in four decades.“I 100 percent support the wall,” Homan added.He spent much of his speech lashing out at so-called “sanctuary” cities that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities, often by declining to hold some undocumented immigrants accused of lesser state crimes until federal authorities can pick them up. Homan said it irritated him that politicians who have “never carried a badge and a gun” can limit his agents’ ability to go into local jails to make arrests.Working through the jails, he said, expedites the deportation process and makes it safer for ICE agents, because they don’t have to go knocking on people’s doors. Restricting ICE’s access to local jails, he said, will only drive his agents to target undocumented immigrants in their neighborhoods, which will result in more unauthorized immigrants without criminal records being picked up.ICE under Homan’s watch has received much criticism from immigrant rights groups and some Democratic politicians for an uptick in arrests of unauthorized immigrants without criminal convictions. Those critics deride the Trump administration’s tactics as unfocused, saying they breed fear in immigrant communities. Some local law enforcement officials, including some of the police chiefs and sheriffs for the largest cities and counties in Texas, have also warned that indiscriminate deportation efforts make immigrants distrustful of local cops.Less than a week after Trump took office, his administration tossed out Obama-era guidelines that focused deportation efforts on recent border-crossers, people with serious criminal histories and those who had prior deportations on their records.But according to Homan, the only way to resolve the country’s contentious immigration problems is by cracking down on undocumented immigrants more uniformly. And he characterized critics ― whether local officials, journalists or “people on on the left” ― as unworthy of contradicting him on policy, unless they’ve worked in law enforcement.“When they’ve seen what we’ve seen, then they can have an opinion,” Homan said, addressing himself to the immigration agents and officials in the room. “Until then, we’re going to enforce the law without apology. And I’m not going to stop talking.” "
6,POLITICS,Rep. Adam Schiff: GOP's FBI Memo Could Lead To 'Constitutional Crisis',Carla Herreria,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/adam-schiff-fbi-memo-constitutional-crisis_us_5a725d52e4b09a544b565582,"The Democrat blames House Speaker Paul Ryan for allowing Republicans to carry out a ""conspiracy theory.""",2018-02-01,"Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee, called the memo a ""conspiracy theory"" designed by Republicans.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a727a78160000450013968a.jpeg?cache=CvCbuyIVdS&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) warned of a looming “constitutional crisis” if Republicans in Congress succeed in having a controversial classified memo released that reportedly attacks the FBI and the Justice Department’s Russia investigation.Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, railed against the release of the memo produced by the committee’s chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), in an op-ed for The Washington Post on Wednesday. Schiff called the four-page document, which Republicans claim reveals the FBI’s political bias, a “conspiracy theory” designed by the GOP to undermine the FBI and Justice Department as their investigations into Russian ties to the Trump campaign go deeper. “As [special counsel Robert] Mueller and his team move closer to the president and his inner circle, a sense of panic is palpable on the Hill,” Schiff wrote. “GOP members recognize that the probe threatens not only the president but also their majorities in Congress.”The risk of a “constitutional crisis” is increased, he said, by “setting the stage for subsequent actions by the White House” to fire Mueller or Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.Schiff accused Republicans of attempting to undermine the Justice Department and FBI by painting them as “so tainted by bias against President Trump that they irredeemably poisoned the investigation.”He added, “This decision to employ an obscure rule to order the release of classified information for partisan political purposes crossed a dangerous line.”House Republicans on Monday voted along party lines to release the classified Nunes memo, a move a legal expert called unprecedented on CNN. During that same meeting, Republicans voted against releasing a counter-memo produced by Democrats.During Monday’s meeting, Schiff accused Republicans of breaking the intelligence panel’s nonpartisan tradition by working in favor of President Donald Trump’s political agenda, according to a transcript released Wednesday.“You know, again, I think what we are seeing here is the result of having a President of the United States who does not respect the institutions of our government or a system with checks and balances,” Schiff argued.“And it is hard for me to escape the conclusion that this is anything but doing the bidding of the White House. We are accusing the FBI and the Department of Justice here of wrongdoing without giving them any opportunity to be heard.”Republicans claim they are pushing for their memo’s release as an act of transparency so that the public can assess the information in it for themselves. In a letter to Nunes, however, a Justice Department official said that releasing the classified memo would be “extraordinarily reckless” and could “risk harm to national security and to ongoing investigations.”On Wednesday, the FBI released an unsigned statement expressing “grave concerns” over the memo’s release and inaccuracies it may contain.“The FBI was provided a limited opportunity to review this memo the day before the committee voted to release it,” the bureau said in the statement. “As expressed during our initial review, we have grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo’s accuracy.”Nunes, whose staff wrote the memo, responded to the FBI’s statement saying that its objections came as “no surprise.”Schiff warned that if the memo were to be released, the intelligence community might no longer trust members of Congress with “closely guarded national secrets.”“Intelligence agencies can no longer be confident that material they provide the committee will not be repurposed and manipulated for reasons having nothing to do with national security,” Schiff wrote. “As a result, they will be far more reluctant to share their secrets with us in the future.”“This is a grave cost for short-term political gain,” he added.While Nunes is responsible for the memo’s potential release, Schiff laid the blame on House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) for allowing Nunes to carry on an attack against the Justice Department.“Nunes may have wielded the committee gavel here,” Schiff said. “But the ultimate responsibility lies with [Ryan], who lacked the courage to stop him.”The Intelligence Committee sent the classified memo to President Donald Trump, who has four days to decide whether to release it or block it. Hours after the op-ed was published, Schiff in a letter accused Nunes of secretly making “material changes” to the classified memo before sending it to the White House for Trump to review. Schiff tweeted the letter and claimed that Republicans were being “deliberately misleading” by altering the material in the memo without the approval of committee members. He called on the Republicans in the committee to withdraw the memo sent to Trump because it is “not the same document shared with the entire House and on which Committee members voted.”This article was updated to include quotes from the committee meeting, information on the Democrats’ counter-memo and Schiff’s letter to Nunes on changes made to the memo."
7,WOMEN,Michigan Police Department Apologizes To Nassar Accuser For Not Believing Her,Sara Boboltz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/meridian-township-michigan-apology-brianne-randall-gay_us_5a73368ce4b06fa61b4e413d,"Fourteen years later, Brianne Randall-Gay is getting her due.",2018-02-01,Meridian Township manager Frank Walsh apologizes to sexual assault survivor Brianne Randall-Gay (on video screen) on Feb. 1.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a736d102d00001f00943765.jpeg?cache=Y0MxjGDNQV&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Authorities in Michigan’s Meridian Township issued a public apology on Thursday to Brianne Randall-Gay, a woman who told police that former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar had groped her breasts and buttocks and attempted to penetrate her vagina during an appointment for back pain in 2004. A Meridian detective investigated the report but ultimately took Nassar’s word over Randall-Gay’s, accepting that the actions were part of a legitimate medical treatment.“We let you down, Brianne. And the outcome of that is that we’re all going to be better,” township manager Frank Walsh said at a press conference that Randall-Gay attended via video.Nassar was sentenced in January on seven counts of criminal sexual conduct in one of the largest sex abuse scandals in U.S. history. Meridian police are now planning several steps to improve their response to such reports.“We know we can be better. We will be better, and we are sorry that we were manipulated and deceived back in 2004,” Walsh said. Randall-Gay, then 17, told officers that Nassar’s treatment was unlike the back massages she had been receiving in physical therapy for scoliosis. Detective Andrew McCready interviewed Nassar but did not consult any outside medical experts to confirm his statements. Nassar supplied the police with an informational slideshow on the purported treatment, including photos of a doctor applying pressure between the legs of young women. Walsh said that Nassar also “brought in a stack of medical journals.”The department’s decision not to press charges had left her feeling “disappointed” and “ignored,” Randall-Gay said Thursday.“Although this doesn’t erase the pain I felt,” she said, “this process has been therapeutic for me and allowed me to let go of the anger I have had.”Nassar, who was employed by Michigan State University and USA Gymnastics, is expected to spend the rest of his life in prison. The number of women who have now come forward to say he abused them, usually during medical treatments, stands at 265.Randall-Gay’s partially redacted report to police was made public for the first time this week. She had seen Nassar twice, she said. At the end of her first appointment, to which she went with her mother, Randall-Gay said Nassar asked for a hug. The doctor referred her to another office for physical therapy, but told her to come back for a check-up.At her second appointment, Randall-Gay was alone. She said he massaged her back and crotch for about 20 minutes and then moved on to massage her breasts for 10 to 15 minutes. Asked whether she felt pain, Randall-Gay told him no, even though she did.According to the police report: “He was trying to put his finger in her vagina. She had a tampon in her vagina, and she said that she could tell he could tell that it was there.” Nassar asked for a hug after the second appointment, too, she said.The day after the alleged assault, Randall-Gay told police that she felt “scared” and “uncomfortable” following the second appointment.Nearly two weeks later, McCready interviewed Nassar, who said he’d touched his patient as part of a medical technique called “sacrotuberous ligament release.” Late last year, Walsh and Meridian Township police chief David Hall called Randall-Gay to apologize for how the department had handled her report. Recalling that phone call on Thursday, Randall-Gay said she broke down in tears.She later met Walsh and Hall in person and discussed how the department could change for the better. McCready, now a sergeant, did not participate in the press conference, but Walsh said he had also apologized to Randall-Gay in a “private conversation” and is “extremely remorseful.” At the time of the assault, McCready was a four-year veteran of the department. Hall outlined several new initiatives, including better training for police officers and staff led by outside consultants and a new community outreach program aimed at teaching young people how to recognize and deal with sexual abuse. In November, the department began combing through criminal sexual conduct reports from 2000 to 2018, searching for other mistakes. Hall said they have not found any yet.Nassar’s sentencing hearing for three additional counts of criminal sexual conduct is currently underway in Charlotte, Michigan."

There’s no way to know without looking in your fridge, but that’s impossible. Or is it? New smart technology refrigerators, such as LG’s forthcoming InstaView ThinQ fridge, allow you to use your phone to remotely check on the contents of your fridge. The fridge is also equipped with Amazon’s virtual assistant, Alexa, so you can ask it to create shopping lists, set food expiration dates, or tell you the weather.The LG fridge joins the ranks of products that are connected to the internet and billed as able to make our lives easier by performing automated tasks. The global smart home market is set to explode; one study published earlier this month estimates it will reach more than $53 billion by 2022.Thanks to constant upgrades, the release of new models and tech companies purposefully shortening the lifespan of their products ― a practice known as planned obsolescence ― people are buying new tech items more and more frequently. As appliances like washers, air purifiers, printers and stoves become more like other gadgets, it’s likely consumers will be replacing them more often. And throwing them out more often. That means a fresh glut of used electronics going into landfills and contributing to water, soil and air pollution. Plus, making these gadgets is very resource-intensive, using metals such as lithium, cobalt and aluminum, as well as silicon wafers and plastics. There’s also a human element to consider: Workers risk their health and safety by exposing themselves to hazardous chemicals while processing the waste. Some progress is being made with increased recycling rates and “takeback” schemes, but experts say corporations and the government need to make sure electronics are more sustainable throughout their life cycle. “The market system is set up to ask companies to focus on profit,” said Eric Williams, an associate professor of technology at the Rochester Institute of Technology and an expert on electronics waste. “Performance and price of the product are really the dominant design factors.”Electronics waste — discarded items such as computers, TVs, mobile phones and printers ― has been steadily on the rise, from 41 million metric tons in 2014 to 45 million metric tons in 2016. It is the fastest growing waste stream in the world.And some say the figure is likely far higher than what is being reported.“I am convinced that all available stats for e-waste volumes are understated,” said Bob Houghton, a pioneer of electronics recycling in the U.S. and CEO at Sage Sustainable Electronics. “There are now electronics in everything from toys to cars, which are never included in industry estimates.” But as electronics trash has risen, so, too, has the amount being recycled. Forty-one percent of discarded electronics were recycled in 2014, compared to 10 percent in 2000, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.This is partly because large technology and consumer goods companies have made it easier for customers to recycle their used electronics. Most big brands now offer takeback options for consumers. Apple’s Renew program allows consumers to recycle any Apple device. LG operates a similar initiative that has significantly boosted the company’s recycling rates. It recycled 41 million pounds of electronic devices in 2016, compared to 8 million pounds in 2010. “There’s been a major evolution over the years,” said Rick Goss, senior vice president of environment and sustainability at the Information Technology Industry Council, which advocates on behalf of major technology companies. Energy and the environment are now factored in at the very beginning of product design, Goss said.“[Our customers] want recycling options,” he said. “They are demanding it from us.”Yet huge amounts of e-waste remain in landfills. Only around 20 percent, or 9 million metric tons, of e-waste was recycled around the world in 2016. Companies need to do more to make sure their products are easier to recycle, said Tensie Whelan, director of the Center for Sustainable Business at New York University’s Stern School of Business. This means designing electronics in such a way that the toxic parts, such as lead and mercury, can be easily separated from nontoxic parts for proper disposal.But the onus is not just on corporations. Governments have a big part to play in keeping e-waste levels low. They can pass laws to stop the illegal shipping of used electronics to developing countries like India and China ― countries that often lack the infrastructure to safely recycle toxic waste, which puts people and the environment at risk. Forty percent of e-waste given to recyclers in the U.S. was shipped to junkyards abroad, mostly in Asia, according to a 2016 report from environmental nonprofit the Basel Action Network. There is currently no federal law in the U.S. that bans the export of these goods, even though it’s illegal in many other countries to import e-waste.“We [in the technology sector] are in lockstep with governments, and what we’re all trying to accomplish is to stop the illegal transfer of e-waste to countries that can’t manage it,” Goss said. “It’s a very complex challenge. I won’t sugarcoat it.” Goss acknowledged that the “innovation cycle for our products is rather fast.” The proliferation of products from different manufacturers is also an issue, he added, especially from smaller manufacturers which may lack the reuse and recycling commitments of bigger companies.John Taylor, senior vice president of public affairs and sustainability at LG Electronics USA, said customers ask for upgraded features. People want their devices to be interconnected and controllable with the click of a smartphone button, he said.“We don’t just develop these products because we think they’re cool,” Taylor added. “We’re responding to consumer demand.”But consumers are often forced to upgrade their devices because companies make it difficult for older models to work optimally, said Williams from RIT.“Premature obsolescence is an ongoing issue,” he said. “Devices can be difficult to repair or sometimes need upgrading to keep up with new operating systems, leading to extra purchases of new devices.” That’s not to say that smart home products can’t be used in a green way. “A talking fridge that adjusts its energy use to be less intensive and helps you better manage your food so you have less food waste would be extremely useful,” said Whelan of NYU.The challenge is what happens to the fridge when it is done talking. Clarification: Language paraphrasing Goss’s remarks on the production cycle and obsolescence have been amended to reflect that the author, and not Goss, was suggesting that this results in more devices being thrown away.For more content and to be part of the “This New World” community, join our Facebook Group.HuffPost’s “This New World” series is funded by Partners for a New Economy and the Kendeda Fund.

The memo reportedly accuses the Justice Department and the FBI of inappropriately surveilling Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. Democrats have called the memo misleading, and in a rare public move, the FBI has warned that the memo withholds key facts.“As expressed during our initial review, we have grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo’s accuracy,” the FBI said in a statement.Pelosi, the Democratic House leader, blasted Nunes in her letter, saying the California Republican has “disgraced the House Intelligence Committee.”“It has now come to our attention that Congressman Nunes deliberately and materially altered the contents of the memo since it was voted on by the House Republicans,” Pelosi said. “This action is not only dangerous, it is illegitimate, and violates House rules.”Ryan must “put an end to this charade,” Pelosi said.“Congressman Nunes’ deliberately dishonest actions make him unfit to serve as Chairman, and he must be removed immediately from his position,” she said.

These plants, which already work at feverish speeds of up to 1,106 hogs per hour, would likely use the change as an opportunity to further increase the pace of production. In addition to increasing line speeds, the proposal would allow employees to take over some of the oversight duties that USDA inspectors currently handle on the kill lines.The way it works now, USDA inspectors are expected to examine every animal that comes down the line, and are tasked with identifying diseased hogs and visible fecal matter. Under the proposed rule, plant employees would take over that job before the carcasses reach federal inspectors.The move could potentially help the hog industry’s bottom line. But faster speeds could also put consumers at risk, since inspectors may not be able to examine each carcass adequately for diseases and other issues. Increasing the rate of speed lines could present more risks for plant workers who already face a slew of hazards at the industry’s current pace, including amputations and musculoskeletal injuries, such as carpal tunnel syndrome. But the USDA maintains that it’s not its responsibility to ensure worker safety ― that’s up to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, said Carmen Rottenberg, deputy administrator at the Food Safety and Inspection Service at USDA.The proposal is “a gift to the industry,” said Tony Corbo, senior lobbyist with Washington-based advocacy group Food & Water Watch. “The industry has been pushing to deregulate inspection all the way back to the Reagan administration.”Corbo added that while the proposed rule fits in with the Trump administration’s “deregulatory talk,” the concept actually precedes the current presidency. During the Obama administration, the USDA approved a similar plan for poultry plants in 2014. But after getting bombarded with pushback from activists and the media, the government organization decided to prohibit plants from ramping up the speeds on slaughter lines. Rottenberg told HuffPost that the revised protocol would increase efficiency and free up USDA inspectors to perform other tasks around the hog plants.The organization pointed to the “success” of a pilot program that started in the late 1990s, which allowed five hog plants to operate as their own designated speeds.“For large-volume establishments, this new swine inspection system does make better use of the agency’s resources while also removing unnecessary regulatory obstacles to industry,” said Rottenberg. But a 2013 report from the Office of the Inspector General harshly criticized the USDA for its lack of oversight of pork slaughterhouses in general, and took issue with the five plants involved in the pilot program in particular.The report concluded that between 2008 and 2011, three of the 10 plants with the most citations for food safety and animal welfare violations were part of the USDA pilot program. Those plants, which had 50 percent more citations than the plant with next highest number, continue to run at the same speeds. Workers’ advocates also say that faster line speeds will make an already dangerous job even more dangerous.Serious injuries ― those that require work restrictions or days off from work ― are more than three times higher in meat packing than other U.S. industries, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.While protecting workers is not within the USDA’s regulatory purview, activists say that workers at slaughterhouses – who are often refugees and immigrants that are reluctant to speak up about hazardous conditions ― rely on USDA’s rules to keep them safe.“Food safety regulations have acted as a de facto throttle on line speeds, and has consequently protected workers,” said Nicole Civita, a lawyer, professor, food ethicist and director of the Food Recovery Project.Before moving forward with the proposed rule, the USDA will accept comments from the public for 60 days, through mid-March. Earlier this week, the USDA rejected a petition from the National Chicken Council requesting that poultry processing plants be allowed to do away with line speed maximums. Activists say there’s no difference between the poultry and hog industries: If the USDA rejected the idea of increasing line speed for chickens, they should also reject it for hogs for the same reasons. “Do people really want to eat meat that has not been properly processed? What if they find toenails in their hot dogs, or if hogs were diseased and haven’t been caught because the lines are moving so fast?” Corbo said. “Operating at these excessive line speeds without having adequate inspection will put more product into commerce [and] on people’s tables that are unsafe and not wholesome to eat.”"

Moore was suspended later that week, following a HuffPost report that he fostered a culture of fear in the newsroom, telling employees that he would get rid of anyone who complained about him to HR. HuffPost also reported that Tronc had suspended and begun investigating Jones, after the company received complaints about him as well. At least some of those complaints were sexual in nature.Former employees told HuffPost that Jones, who worked at the newspaper for over two decades, displayed a “pattern” of inappropriate behavior toward young women.Tronc’s investigation into “various complaints” determined that Jones made “unwanted physical contact with female employees such as kissing them, hugging them and/or grabbing their hands,” according to an internal company email obtained by HuffPost.Additionally, the document revealed that Jones had previously been given a “warning” about his behavior and that the decision to terminate his employment was based partially on Jones’ “own admissions.” It was dated Jan. 30. Staffers also told HuffPost that the human resources department did not take proper action on complaints against Jones’ behavior prior to Tronc’s takeover.“Media, as you know, is a tough enough biz to work in these days,” one staffer told HuffPost at the time. “It’s even tougher for women, because you have men like Rob and Doc contaminating the culture.”The New York Daily News has since brought back former Editor-in-Chief Jim Rich after a brief stint as executive editor of HuffPost. The outlet had been searching for a permanent editor-in-chief since at least December, when Arthur Browne retired. "

The accessory replaces a standard rifle stock ― the piece that rests against the shoulder ― and harnesses a weapon’s recoil to slide the gun rapidly back and forth onto the shooter’s trigger finger, firing each time. The gunman who opened fire on tens of thousands of concertgoers in Las Vegas last October had attached bump stocks to at least a dozen assault-style rifles, law enforcement officials said. He was able to shoot more than 1,100 rounds over the span of a few minutes, killing 58 people and wounding 422. More than 400 others were injured in the chaos caused by the shooting.“We saw in Las Vegas the carnage, which far exceeded the carnage of any other mass shooting in U.S. history, and it made it very clear to me that there’s no purpose whatsoever for a bump stock, other than killing a lot of people very quickly,” said John Rosenthal, founder of Stop Handgun Violence, a Massachusetts-based nonprofit that advocated for the measure.Bump stocks “should be banned, and I am proud of Massachusetts to be the first state in the nation to do the right thing,” he said.California and New York had banned the devices before the Las Vegas shooting.In Massachusetts, anyone found in possession of a bump stock or other similarly banned equipment will be subject to prosecution, with sentences ranging from 18 months to life in prison. The law also prohibits accessories known as trigger cranks, which it defines as any device that “repeatedly activates the trigger of the weapon through the use of a lever or other part that is turned in a circular motion.”The measure exempts “any weapon initially designed and manufactured to fire through the use of a crank or lever.”Sales of both bump stock and trigger cranks have been banned in Massachusetts since the legislation was signed into law in November.Although automatic firearms are strictly regulated under a 1986 federal law, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has determined that the statute doesn’t cover bump stocks or trigger cranks because the items aren’t technically “machine guns” ― defined as weapons that fire multiple rounds with a single pull of the trigger.Lawmakers in Congress have introduced legislation to outlaw the devices. But gun rights groups and GOP leaders, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), have instead called on the ATF to re-examine whether it can regulate them under federal law. The agency is considering what additional action it can take and is expected to announce a final decision in the coming months.Although popular models once retailed for under $200, the possibility of a federal ban sent demand skyrocketing, leading bump stocks to sell for as much as $1,500.Meanwhile, at least 15 states and a number of local jurisdictions have taken taken up proposals to ban the devices following the Las Vegas shooting, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.As the first state to officially ban bump stocks amid the recent push, Massachusetts has emerged as a flashpoint in a predictably contentious debate over how the prohibition will be enforced.Prior to the law’s enactment, the Massachusetts Executive Office of Public Safety and Security had sent all 400,000 of the state’s licensed gun owners a notice informing them that they had until Feb. 1 to turn over bump stocks and other restricted devices to law enforcement.“It was very well publicized in Massachusetts and we expect people to, number one, know about the law, and number two, comply with the law,” said state Rep. David Linsky (D), who authored the bump stock ban measure.“Police departments have been working with the Office of Public Safety to develop a protocol for the destruction of any weapons that get turned in,” he added. “People have had several months now, because they knew this ban was coming, to either give away or sell their items to someone out of state who could legally possess them.”It’s unclear how popular bump stocks have been in Massachusetts. Although the state has some of the nation’s strongest gun laws and keeps comprehensive records of firearms sales and transfers, its statutes didn’t cover these sorts of accessories.Bump stocks “tended to be a novelty item” among Massachusetts gun owners, Linksy said, adding that he didn’t think there were many around the state.A representative for the Massachusetts State Police didn’t immediately respond to a request for information on the number of bump stocks that had been turned over ahead of the deadline.Bans on certain types of weaponry often evoke fears of government confiscation, or “gun-grabbing,” among firearms advocates, but Linksy said police wouldn’t be going door to door to proactively enforce the law.“It will be a law enforcement issue the same way if someone is found with contraband of some other sort,” he said.Gun rights groups have cried foul over the law’s lack of compensation for owners who surrender their bump stocks. Some gun rights organizations have floated the possibility of suing over the payment issue.Other gun rights activists say they understand the frustration, but don’t necessarily see the devices as worth fighting a legal battle over.“They’re not used for any sporting purpose, they’re not used in hunting, they would be impractical for self defense. ... They’re toys,” said Brent Carlton, president and co-founder of the Massachusetts-based gun rights group Comm2A. “But the fact of the matter is people spent money on them, they own them, they presumably have a property interest in them.”The state is prepared to defend the law if activists do end up filing suit, said Linsky.“Some of what I’ll call the extremist gun groups out there are calling this confiscation or calling it a taking without compensation, but if they really believe this, there’s a court system that is ready, willing and able to hear this challenge,” he said."

This time, stoners are the recipients.On Thursday, NBC reporter Andrea Mitchell tweeted about the risks of releasing a secret Republican memo alleging FBI bias against President Donald Trump.The president’s son responded with this tweet that seemed to reference The Washington Post’s slogan, “Democracy Dies In Darkness.”However, there was one teeny-weeny, itsy-bitsy typo that changed the meaning of the message.For those not in in the know, the word “dankness” is actually a positive term among marijuana enthusiasts, one used to describe cannabis that Urban Dictionary says is “superdank,” the “stickiest of the icky” and “the craziest of the haziest.”To put simply: really good weed.Many people found the typo hilarious and let Trump Jr. know they approve wholeheartedly.One person wanted the president’s son to make a slight change to the tweet.Sure, some had reservations with the actual message Trump was attempting to send, but why let that get in the way of a giggle, right?Other people had serious questions how the word showed up on Trump Jr.’s phone, considering its status as a marijuana slang term.One man helpfully suggested that both Trump and his dad embrace “dankness” more often.Another saw the opportunity for the Trumps to make a lot of green. The typo sparks memories of one made by the president in May that drew a frenzy of attention. “Despite the negative press covfefe,” Trump tweeted. After much speculation as to the meaning of the tweet, Trump later deleted the message, posting, “Who can figure out the true meaning of ‘covfefe’ ??? Enjoy!”To Trump Jr.’s credit, he has not edited or removed his tweet as of Thursday afternoon.Washington Post reporter Mark Berman appears to prefer this version of the paper’s slogan over the current one.

18,POLITICS,White Supremacists Are Targeting College Students 'Like Never Before',Christopher Mathias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/white-supremacist-college-campus-propaganada_us_5a7317eee4b06fa61b4dfc47,A new report from the Anti-Defamation League found a 258 percent increase in white supremacist propaganda on college campuses between 2016 and 2017.,2018-02-01,"Neo-Nazis and other members of the ""alt-right"" march through the University of Virginia campus on Aug. 11, 2017",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a7333fc160000200013978d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The amount of white supremacist propaganda on college campuses in the U.S. increased 258 percent between fall 2016 and fall 2017, according to a report the Anti-Defamation League released Thursday. There were 147 incidents of white supremacist flyers, banners, posters or stickers found on college campuses during the 2017 fall semester, the report states, compared to 41 such incidents in the fall semester of 2016.The ADL counted a total of 346 incidents of hate propaganda that had been spread on 216 college campuses in 44 states and Washington, D.C., since September 2016. “White supremacists are targeting college campuses like never before,” Jonathan Greenblatt, the CEO of the organization, said in a statement. “They see campuses as a fertile recruiting ground, as evident by the unprecedented volume of propagandist activity designed to recruit young people to support their vile ideology.”The propaganda delivered “a range of messages,” according to the report. “It may promote a white supremacist group, or trumpet the urgent need to ‘save’ the white race,” the report says. “Frequently, the propaganda attacks minority groups, including Jews, Blacks, Muslims, non-white immigrants, and the LGBT community.” The groups responsible for the majority of the propaganda belong to the so-called “alt-right,” a newer generation of organized racists and fascists. The report says one such group, Identity Evropa, targeted college campuses with its propaganda 158 times, accounting for 46 percent of the incidents counted by ADL. Identity Evropa eschews traditional white supremacist imagery and language in favor of more innocuous-sounding slogans like “Our Generation. Our Future. Our Last Chance.” Other groups, however, like the Atomwaffen Division, posted flyers directly threatening minority groups or featuring Nazi imagery. The ADL report offers further evidence of an emboldened and increasingly active white supremacist movement in the U.S. This movement gained international attention in August 2017, when white supremacists held a nighttime march through the campus of the University of Virginia in Charlottesvile before violently confronting counterprotesters.The next day, these same marchers were part of a violent pro-Donald Trump rally in Charlottesville — the largest gathering of white supremacists in over a decade — that turned deadly when a member of the group Vanguard America allegedly drove his car through a crowd of counterprotesters and killed 32-year-old Heather Heyer.White supremacists killed twice as many people in 2017 as they did the year before, according to a separate ADL report published last month. White supremacists made other concerted efforts to make their existence known on college campuses last year. Identity Evropa held a private speaking event at San Diego State University. At Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas, white supremacists associated with Vanguard America tweeted photos of themselves giving Nazi salutes on the campus. And at the University of Texas in Austin, 25 people affiliated with the white supremacist group Patriot Front filmed themselves wearing masks and marching with torches through the campus. Prominent “alt-right” activist Richard Spencer also delivered speeches at Auburn University and the University of Florida. The night before the speech at the UF, HuffPost asked Spencer and Eli Mosely, formerly of Identity Evropa, why they focused so much of their efforts on universities. “This is a young person’s movement,” Spencer said. “Young people matter, and college campuses have been where political battles have been fought since the ’60s and before it,” Mosley said. “This is where political change happens. Fundamentally, it’s where the most anti-white institution is. Academia has become a factory for anti-white individuals, and to teach whites to hate themselves.” “When we go to these schools, we’re not going to intimidate people of color or anything like that,” he added. Spencer’s speech the next day was drowned out by rowdy counterprotesters. Afterward, three white supremacists who had traveled to Florida for Spencer’s speech were arrested for firing a gun at counterprotesters. Spencer is scheduled to speak at Michigan State University and the University of Cincinnati in the next few months. White supremacist groups have already been active in targeting campuses with their propaganda in the first month of 2018.Members of Idenity Evropa tried to disrupt an ethnic studies class at the University of California, San Diego. Last week, Vanguard America vandalized a Black History Month poster at Middle State Tennessee University with its own propaganda. And Patriot Front claimed to have posted its propaganda at San Diego Mesa College in California on Wednesday night. America does not do a good job of tracking incidents of hate and bias.

He wouldn't condemn it for calling the Holocaust a ""hoax.""",2018-02-01,"Joe Arpaio endorses then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump prior to a rally on Jan. 26, 2016 in Marshalltown, Iowa.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a736d702d00001f00943766.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Two weeks after he announced his candidacy for a U.S. Senate seat in Arizona, former sheriff Joe Arpaio gave an interview to a far-right publication that has pushed wildly anti-Semitic claims that the Holocaust was a hoax and that the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks were the result of a Jewish plot. Arpaio talked to the American Free Press on Jan. 21, arguing for his viability as a Senate candidate and defending President Donald Trump’s agenda, according to a report from the liberal media watchdog group Media Matters. It’s at least the fifth time Arpaio has talked to the newspaper, which the Anti-Defamation League describes as “an anti-Semitic conspiracy-oriented publication.”In an interview with HuffPost, Arpaio wouldn’t condemn American Free Press for saying that the murder of 6 million Jews and millions of other people never happened. And although he appeared to acknowledge that the Holocaust was a historical event, he said he wouldn’t comment on American Free Press or its articles claiming the Holocaust was a hoax.“I talk to anybody,” he said. “I have an open-door policy. I don’t research every company that talks to me.”HuffPost emphasized to Arpaio that American Free Press is an extremist and anti-Semitic publication. “Alex Jones,” Arpaio replied, referring to the infamous InfoWars conspiracy theorist who has claimed the massacre of children at Sandy Hook Elementary School was a hoax, that 9/11 was orchestrated by the U.S. government, and that juice boxes make kids gay. “Is he extreme?” HuffPost replied that yes, Jones is pretty extreme. “Well I go on his show,” Arpaio said. HuffPost, he added, is a “very controversial” paper too, that “isn’t nice” to him. American Free Press has served as a platform for Holocaust denial, a prominent anti-Semitic movement often promoted by neo-Nazis that either denies or downplays the well-documented genocide of Jewish people during World War II. American Free Press published an article with the headline “Meet The Man Who Invented The Holocaust” in 2015, referring to Nobel Peace Prize winner and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel. That same year, it published an article with the headline “Why Can We Question Anything But The ‘Holocaust?’” In 2012, the paper published an audio interview titled “Holocaust Hoax Exposed.” In 2011, it published one titled “Jewish Fingerprints All Over 9/11,” about a supposed Jewish “plot” to attack America.And the publication’s bookstore once sold a book titled The Holocaust Never Happened & The CIA Killed JFK, which claims to “destroy the hoax of the 6 million Jewish victims of Nazi Germany.”What happened in World War II, Arpaio told HuffPost, was a “sad” part of history.“I’m not contesting that,” he said, adding that he has a “deep respect for the Jewish people.”HuffPost listed the American Free Press’ Holocaust-denying headlines, and asked whether he would condemn the publication.“I’m not even commenting on that,” he said. “I don’t know what [those articles] said.”Arpaio and his office gained national notoriety during his 24-year tenure as sheriff in Maricopa County, Arizona, for terrorizing the area’s Latino population, unlawfully rounding up and detaining people he accused of being in the U.S. illegally. In a jail he called a “concentration camp,” Arpaio often marched Latino inmates into a segregated tent city surrounded by an electric fence. An estimated 160 people died in Arpiao’s jails, many by suicide. Despite his claims of having an “open-door” policy with the media, The Phoenix New Times — which has diligently covered Arpaio for years — claims Arpaio banned its reporters from press conferences, ignored requests for county records, and threatened to arrest reporters. In 2007, Arpaio orchestrated the arrest of the paper’s co-founders on misdemeanor charges, but prosecutors declined to prosecute. The co-founders sued over the arrest and won a $3.75 million settlement. Last year, Arpaio was convicted of criminal contempt for violating a court order mandating his department stop unlawfully detaining individuals based on suspicions of their legal status. Trump pardoned Arpaio in July 2017, sparing him jail time. This month, he announced his bid for U.S. Senate. Ryan Lenz, a senior investigative writer for the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks extremism in the U.S., called American Free Press one of “the most prominent and insidious far-right publications out there.” The publication, he noted, was founded by Willis Carto, an avowed white supremacist, Nazi sympathizer and Holocaust denier. An American World War II veteran, Carto famously once stated that he regretted fighting against the Nazis. By granting American Free Press interviews, Lenz said, Arpaio assigns an “imprimatur of legitimacy to conspiracy theories and racist and extremist thought.”Arpaio is a hero to many in the far right, and when thousands of his supporters across the country see he talked to American Free Press, the publication’s ideas can appear “legitimate” in their eyes, Lenz said. “The interview serves as a vehicle for these ideas to travel from the margins into the mainstream.” Arpaio is not the only public official to have granted American Free Press an interview in recent years. Last week, CNN’s KFile uncovered an interview Rep. Lou Barletta (R-Pa.) did with the publication in 2006. Like Arpaio, Barletta is now running for Senate. And Jon Feere, now a senior adviser at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, gave an interview to American Free Press in 2012, when he still worked at the Center for Immigration Studies, an anti-immigrant think tank. Arpaio has spoken to American Free Press on at least four other occasions, including in 2014, when he granted an interview to writer Victor Thorn, author of books The Holocaust Hoax Exposed: Debunking the 20th Century’s Greatest Fabrication and Made in Israel: 9-11 and the Jewish Plot Against America.America does not do a good job of tracking incidents of hate and bias. We need your help to create a database of such incidents across the country, so we all know what’s going on. Tell us your story.

20,CRIME,Nassar's Defense Attorney Says 265 Survivors 'Just Feel Like' They Were Abused,Alanna Vagianos,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nassars-defense-attorney-says-265-survivors-just-feel-like-they-were-victimized_us_5a732ef3e4b06fa61b4e27de,"Shannon Smith says she has a ""very hard time believing"" that all of these women and girls are telling the truth.",2018-02-01,"Larry Nassar in court with his defense attorney Shannon Smith on Nov. 22, 2017. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a7333fd2d000049009436d8.jpeg?cache=iGaYod4bJm&ops=crop_0_285_5760_3346%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Larry Nassar’s defense attorney, Shannon Smith, told Detroit radio WWJ on Thursday that she has a “very hard time believing” her client sexually abused hundreds of young girls and women.Smith, who has represented the disgraced doctor since December 2016, commented on his ongoing sentencing that has taken place in recent weeks.“I have a very hard time believing that my client could have even possibly assaulted that many people day in and day out in front of their parents. And that every single one of those things was a crime, but he was such a manipulator he got away with it,” Smith said. “I just can’t imagine that’s true.” Nassar has been accused by over 265 women of serial sexual abuse under the guise of medical treatment. His victims include Olympic gymnasts Aly Raisman and Simone Biles, along with dozens for former Michigan State University athletes. One of his victims was as young as 6 during the time of the abuse.Nassar pleaded guilty to 10 of those accusations in November and was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison last week on seven of those charges. On Wednesday, a sentence hearing for the remaining three counts began. Smith added that she believes many of the survivors are confused and that Nassar never actually sexually abused them. “Some of those girls, to be quite frank, they didn’t even know what to think because they never felt victimized. He was never inappropriate to them. And because of everything they’ve seen, they just feel like they must have been victimized. And I think that’s really unfortunate,” she said.She insinuated that media reports influenced the 156 women who gave victim impact statements in court during Nassar’s first sentence hearing.“As much as they were allowed to speak at sentencing, and that was something we agreed to, even during the sentencing, more and more people were coming forward thinking ‘I was fine my whole life and now all of a sudden I have realized I was a survivor,’” Smith said. “I think that’s really sad.”She went even further, saying that Nassar’s behavior was appropriate because “there is a legitimate medical treatment that involves touching sensitive areas and even penetrations.” Smith added that Nassar’s case should serve as a warning to other doctors because they need to “protect” themselves “from false allegations.” While pelvic floor exams are legitimate and used in instances of bladder leakage and chronic pelvic pain, it is rarely done on women under 18 years old and always requires parental consent. HuffPost guest writer and physical therapist Lori Mize recently wrote about how Nassar’s treatments were nowhere near what a legitimate pelvic floor exam looks like. “Nassar’s victims have described an environment antithetical to standard pelvic physical therapy practices,” she wrote. “There was no chaperone, parent or guardian in the room during his ‘treatments.’ He didn’t use gloves, and one athlete said she was under the influence of a sleeping pill during a ‘treatment’ session. In many cases, Nassar performed intra-vaginal ‘exams’ on athletes whose injuries had nothing to do with the victim’s pelvic area.”“Everyone is entitled to a defense under the constitution,” she told WWJ Radio.

21,POLITICS,'Racist Attack' Stirs Democratic Feud In Michigan Governor's Race,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/abdul-el-sayed-michigan-governor-democrat-eligibility_us_5a729526e4b0bf6e6e219a8d,"Democrats are questioning the eligibility of progressive underdog Abdul El-Sayed, who would be the first Muslim state leader in the U.S.",2018-02-01,"Abdul El-Sayed, the former health director of Detroit, is running a progressive campaign for Michigan's Democratic gubernatorial nomination.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a4d6a802100003e005f6fe5.jpeg?cache=JPl9WzHlrL&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Supporters of Michigan Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abdul El-Sayed are attacking reports questioning his eligibility to run as the work of racially motivated party insiders threatened by his progressive politics.The uproar exposes deep-seated suspicions between warring Democratic Party factions, and threatens to turn Michigan’s gubernatorial primary into an internecine battleground of the kind party leaders hope to avoid in November.“It is pretty obvious to me that this is a racist attack masquerading as a legal concern,” said Betsey Coffia, a Traverse City-based progressive activist, said of a magazine article that raises legal questions about El-Sayed’s eligibility to be a candidate.“Nobody can come out and say something blatantly racist, but I do think there is underlying racism and xenophobia with this kind of attack,” said Kelly Collison, chair of the Michigan Democratic Party’s progressive caucus.The controversy burst into the open with an article that appeared Wednesday on the website of Michigan’s Bridge magazine: “Abdul El-Sayed’s stint in NYC may derail bid for Michigan governor.” It cited an obscure state law requiring any candidate for state office to be a “registered elector,” or voter, in the state for the four years preceding a run for office.El-Sayed, a 33-year-old physician who led Detroit’s Health Department from 2015 to 2017, has maintained continuous voter registration in Michigan, where he was born and raised, since 2003.But Bridge noted that when El-Sayed went to medical school in New York City in 2012, he registered to vote in New York. El-Sayed’s New York registration from 2013 to 2015 made him ineligible to vote in Michigan during that time, according to five out of six anonymous lawyers Bridge said it consulted.Those attorneys told the magazine El-Sayed’s opponents would have strong grounds for a legal challenge to his eligibility to appear on the ballot.“There will be a court case, guaranteed,” an anonymous Democratic official assured Bridge. “The only question is who is going to step up to take him out.” Another nameless Democrat warned of a “nightmare scenario” in which El-Sayed prevails in the primary only to have Republicans successfully challenge his status on the ballot in the general election.The Bridge article also implied that El-Sayed was dishonest when he claimed he tried to vote for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) during the March 2016 Michigan primary, where Sanders upset Hillary Clinton, but the lines at his polling place in Detroit were too long. El-Sayed was actually registered to vote elsewhere in the state at the time, and only registered in Detroit weeks after the primary, Bridge reported.El-Sayed remained officially registered to vote in Michigan throughout this period, according to the magazine. A spokesman for the Michigan Department of State told Bridge that given the cancellation of his Michigan driver’s license, El-Sayed would have been asked to verify his Michigan address if he had tried to vote during this period. He would not, however, have been categorically forbidden from voting.El-Sayed has owned an apartment in Ann Arbor since 2008, allowing him to claim continuous residency in Michigan.It’s illegal to vote in more than one place ― which no one is alleging that El-Sayed did. But Americans are legally permitted to register to vote in more than one state. It’s a question that legal scholars weighed in on extensively in January 2017, when President Donald Trump pointed to multiple-state registration as evidence of widespread voter fraud.El-Sayed’s campaign responded with outrage at the notion that he would be ineligible to run in Michigan.“We have looked at this question closely and are confident Abdul El-Sayed is qualified to run for Governor of Michigan,” Robert Lenhard, an attorney representing the campaign who previously served as chair of the Federal Election Commission, said Wednesday in a statement. “Michigan law has never held that absences from the state for school or work cause you to lose your residence,” Lenhard added. “This issue is just a red herring.”In a private video message to supporters, El-Sayed also addressed his attempts to vote for Sanders. Standing in front of the Detroit church where he tried to vote, El-Sayed explained that he was told twice that there would be at least a 90-minute wait to cast his ballot. El-Sayed said his duties as health director didn’t allow such a time commitment.That he apparently was still registered to vote in Ann Arbor would not have precluded him from using a provisional ballot to vote in Detroit, El-Sayed noted.To hear El-Sayed’s campaign and his backers tell it, establishment Democrats are pushing a whisper campaign about El-Sayed’s eligibility out of a combination of genuine prejudice; fear that El-Sayed’s Muslim and Arab heritage would hurt him against a Republican in November; and contempt for El-Sayed’s left-leaning policy positions and maverick campaign style.“The nightmare scenario here is that the strongest candidate ― with real progressive values and new ideas ― gets kneecapped by a racist, insider smear campaign, only to have the insiders’ pick lose in the general election,” Adam Joseph, communications director for El-Sayed’s campaign, said in a statement that inverted the “nightmare scenario” imagined by an anonymous Democrat in the Bridge article.Upstart progressive candidates often struggle to gain traction against well-funded establishment contenders. An investigation in The Intercept last week documented an elaborate system Democratic elites use to promote congressional candidates they see as more “electable” in party primaries ― even when those candidates have losing records ― and undermine others.The El-Sayed campaign and its boosters compare the questions about El-Sayed’s eligibility to President Donald Trump’s “birther” campaign questioning whether President Barack Obama was born in the United States.“Just like racists attacked President Obama years ago, when many questioned whether he was ‘born in the United States’ and compelled him to produce a birth certificate, the current attacks on El-Sayed’s eligibility are driven by hate,” Khaled Beydoun, a law professor at the University of Detroit Mercy, wrote on Facebook.Another El-Sayed backer argued that a more apt analogy might be the way Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign subtlely insinuated that the country was not ready for someone as “foreign” as Obama.“For a lot of us who paid attention to the 2008 presidential race, these sort of attacks feel treacherously familiar,” said a senior aide to a progressive member of Congress, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “When there was too much steam gathering behind the candidate that the anointed establishment favorite didn’t like, the chosen tactic wasn’t to fight back and argue it on the merits, the chosen tactic was to malign Obama with some vile racist smears.”Coffia, the Traverse City activist, considered the timing of the eligibility questions ― so many months after El-Sayed entered the race ― a testament to his success as a candidate.“They must feel pretty threatened,” she said. “Why else would they go on the attack and dog-whistle that this son of Michigan doesn’t belong?”But some Democratic voters take umbrage at El-Sayed and his allies comparing the ballot eligibility questions to the birther crusade.Obama’s birthplace was never legitimately in question, whereas critics say there are real issues with El-Sayed’s eligibility. And they note that former state treasurer Robert Bowman abandoned his 2010 gubernatorial bid amid questions about his residency. Steve Hood, a black Democratic political consultant and talk show host based in Detroit, called any analogy to birtherism “way out of line, because nobody is being racist.” Gary Ringer, a black firefighter and community activist in Detroit, said the retort represented a lack of “accountability.”“Everybody wants to bring up Obama and other things that aren’t relevant,” he said.Neither Hood nor Ringer said they had been seriously considering voting for El-Sayed prior to the controversy. For Democrats, the stakes are high in Michigan, a one-time Democratic stronghold that narrowly went for Trump in the 2016 election. Now, with two-term GOP Gov. Rick Snyder leaving office and many observers predicting a blue wave in the midterm elections, Democrats are working to claw back a toehold in the state.Although public polling is sparse in the Democratic gubernatorial primary, Gretchen Whitmer, 46, a former Democratic state Senate leader, is widely viewed as the front runner. Whitmer’s mainstream progressive campaign, which has emphasized bread-and-butter issues like promoting the skilled trades and raising the minimum wage to $15, has drawn the backing of the pro-choice group EMILY’s List, influential labor unions and former Gov. Jim Blanchard (D). She has raised over $3 million.El-Sayed, who won acclaim as Detroit health director for pioneering a program that provided low-income city schoolchildren with eyeglasses, has embraced state-level single-payer health insurance.El-Sayed’s strongest support has come from backers of Sanders’ presidential campaign and like-minded voters. His detailed plan to revive Michigan’s struggling cities by curbing speculation and protecting homeowners from excessive property tax assessments attracted favorable coverage in the pages of the Nation. He has raised over $1.9 million.Whitmer also was subject to a report in Bridge featuring anonymous quotes from longtime Democratic fixers complaining about her general election viability, and urging other candidates to enter the race. The grumbling prompted charges of sexism.Asked to respond to questions about El-Sayed’s eligibility, Whitmer campaign communications director Annie Ellison said in a statement: “Whitmer is not focused on chatter about who is or is not getting into the race and frankly there has been way too much distraction from how we fix our roads, grow our economy, and protect health care for Michigan families.“Anything that distracts from how we solve problems and put people first in this state is not something she’s paying attention to,” Ellison added.In a follow-up question, HuffPost asked whether Whitmer’s campaign would rule out challenging El-Sayed’s eligibility ahead of the April 24 ballot deadline. “We take Dr. El-Sayed at his word and the campaign will not be challenging anyone’s eligibility,” Ellison said.However, in response to rising chatter about the controversy, Michigan Democratic Party chairman Brand Dillon on Thursday released a statement acknowledging the legitimacy of the questions about El-Sayed’s eligibility and asking that he “take appropriate legal action, including asking the courts for a ruling on his eligibility as soon as possible.”“Regrettably, we feel this is the only way to put this matter to rest quickly and without ambiguity,” Dillon said. “We hope the court would handle this request swiftly and diligently so all of our great candidates, including Dr. El-Sayed, can put this issue behind them and focus on the issues that really matter to the people of Michigan.”HuffPost pressed Dillon to explain why the state Democratic Party would cite the comments of attorneys quoted anonymously in Bridge rather than conduct its own analysis.He argued that a legal analysis commissioned by the state Democratic Party would still elicit skepticism that the party is playing favorites, especially if it affirmed the idea that El-Sayed’s eligibility is in doubt.“That would only deepen cynicism that we were trying to suggest that we thought he shouldn’t be [on the ballot],” Dillon said.Michigan’s partisan primaries are due to take place on Aug. 7.This article has been updated with additional comment from Ellison, as well as with comments from Dillon, Hood and Ringer.

Ryan Costello (R-Pa) in Pennsylvania's 6th District.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a7362ab2d00001f0094374d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It’s remarkable in 2018 that a state with 12.8 million people and 20 members of Congress could have zero women representing it.Welcome to Pennsylvania, the state with the largest all-male delegation in the country.That depressing statistic may change after this year’s midterm elections. A couple of male congressmen have resigned in the Keystone State after being caught up in sexual misconduct scandals, and four more are retiring at the end of this year. As elsewhere around the nation, a slew of impressive women have stepped up to compete for those open seats, motivated by the #MeToo movement and Donald Trump’s presidency. Democrats are especially excited about Chrissy Houlahan. In late January 2017, just after the first Women’s March, EMILY’s List sent a generic fundraising email to its 3 million members asking for a few dollars to help elect female Democratic candidates.Most people just clicked the button in the email prompting them to donate. But Houlahan, a 49-year-old mother of two from Devon, Pennsylvania, hit “reply” and attached her resumé, hoping someone in D.C. might notice her and help her figure out how to run for Congress. Houlahan, an Air Force veteran, inner-city teacher and successful businesswoman, had spent the days after Trump’s election comforting two distraught family members: her 25-year-old daughter, who identifies as queer, and her father, a 75-year-old Holocaust survivor who fled Poland as a child. Both were terrified of what the election meant for people like them.“My dad, this Holocaust survivor and naval officer ― a pretty tough guy ― was crying, worrying that people like him who came to this country with nothing to offer would still have the opportunities he was allowed,” Houlahan told HuffPost. “That was the beginning of thinking I needed to do something.”Houlahan’s email did catch the attention of a staffer at EMILY’s List, who passed it up the ranks of the Democratic women’s PAC. The powerful fundraising group immediately picked her as a viable challenger to the incumbent congressman from Pennsylvania’s 6th Congressional District, Rep. Ryan Costello (R). “She’s got this incredible resumé,” said Julie McClain Downey, a spokeswoman for EMILY’s List. “We were like, ‘Is this some sort of joke? Yes, of course we’ll help you run for Congress.’” Houlahan is a political strategist’s dream candidate. She studied engineering at Stanford, aspiring to become an astronaut, before becoming a captain in the Air Force. She taught chemistry at an inner-city public high school in North Philadelphia through Teach for America, and served as chief operating officer of a successful basketball shoe company and Springboard Collaborative, a nonprofit that supports childhood literacy. Her policy priority is health care, “making sure people have what I believe is access to a human right.” If Houlahan defeats Costello in the 2018 midterms, she’ll bring some much-needed diversity of perspective and experience to Pennsylvania’s delegation. “It’s not just that it’s all men― it’s all men who are lawyers, for the most part,” Houlahan said. “We have people with one skill set representing us.” (Actually, seven of them are lawyers, but a majority are career politicians.) Six Pennsylvania congressmen are not seeking re-election this year, which has created a real opportunity for women to penetrate the old boys club in a heavily gerrymandered state. (The outgoing lawmakers include Rep. Pat Meehan, a Republican, who is resigning after having sexually harassed one of his staffers, and Rep. Tim Murphy, an anti-abortion Republican who allegedly urged the woman with whom he was having an affair to terminate her pregnancy.)“In the last year, it has become abundantly clear that it is no longer acceptable to have women shut out of leadership positions,” said Stephanie Schriock, president of EMILY’s List, who has endorsed two women so far in Pennsylvania.EMILY’s List is already fundraising for Houlahan and Christina Hartman, an international nonprofit leader who is challenging incumbent Rep. Lloyd Smucker (R). The group is likely to endorse more women candidates in the coming months, which may include former Philadelphia Deputy Mayor Nina Ahmad, who is running for Rep. Bob Brady’s (D) open seat, and Navy veteran Rachel Reddick, who is challenging Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R). Jess King, another Democrat running for Smucker’s seat, has been generating grassroots excitement with her progressive populist campaign.These are only a handful of the women running. Laura Quick, a single mom and UPS package car driver from Lebanon County, is running for the seat being vacated by Rep. Charlie Dent (R). Most of these Republican-leaning districts, of course, will be difficult for a relatively unknown Democratic woman to flip. Houlahan, however, has a very strong shot of winning.Pennsylvania’s 6th District, despite having obviously been drawn to give GOP candidates an advantage (Houlahan likens it to a spiked dragon), broke for Hillary Clinton in 2016. EMILY’s List and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee are funneling resources this year into districts that favored Clinton but are currently represented by Republicans, and Houlahan’s early fundraising numbers have been very strong thanks to the support of those groups. The resistance movement has also given Democrats like Houlahan new momentum this year, as evidenced by the massive, unprecedented wave of women running for office and getting involved in politics who have never done so before.Republicans are nervous about Houlahan. National Republican Congressional Committee Chair Steve Stivers called her race against Costello a “bellwether” that could predict how the party fares nationally in the 2018 midterms.“If [Democrats] win in Pennsylvania against Ryan Costello, they’ve got a shot to take the majority,” Stivers told Politico last summer. Houlahan hopes not only to win, but to bring other women with her to represent Pennsylvania in Congress. “I feel bullish,” she said. “It’s important that there’s not just a token woman or two representing Pennsylvania, but that we really get that critical mass to change the course of history.”CORRECTION: A previous version of this story mistakenly indicated Pennsylvania Rep. Bob Brady is a Republican. He is a Democrat. "

Judge Janice Cunningham announced the updated number on Wednesday in a Charlotte, Michigan, courtroom during Nassar’s second sentencing hearing ― on three additional counts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree. “We have over 265 identified victims and an infinite number of victims in the state, in the country, and all over the world,” Cunningham said in the small courtroom Wednesday morning. The three counts Nassar is being sentenced for include two girls between the ages of 13 and 15 years old, and one who is under 13. The charges focus on specific allegations of sexual abuse at a gymnastics club in Dimondale, Michigan, called Twistars. Nassar pleaded guilty to all three counts in November and is expected to receive a minimum of 25 to 40 years in prison. Last week, the disgraced physician was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison on seven child sexual abuse charges. Nassar is a serial child sexual predator and has pleaded guilty to digitally penetrating young athletes while treating them as a medical doctor. His youngest survivor was 6 at the time of the abuse. He’s already serving 60 years on child pornography charges. A large number of the 265 identified survivors are the 156 women who read their impact statements in court during Nassar’s weeklong sentencing hearing that began on Jan. 16. Another 65 survivors are expected to read impact statements during this hearing, which is expected to go into next week. Cunningham noted in court that she expects that number to increase as the hearing continues. About 30 women read victim impact statements in court on Wednesday, either in person or via video message, or had their statement read by a representative from the attorney general’s office. Many of the women said they were inspired to come forward with their stories after listening to the 150-plus women give their impact statements last week. “No high schooler should have to know the inside of a court as well as I do,” victim and former gymnast Jessica Thomashow said in the first statement. Thomashow, whose sister Amanda was also abused by Nassar, says as a gymnast she had been taught to grit her teeth and simply swallow pain, even during Nassar’s “treatments.”“Larry Nassar is evil,” Thomashow said. “What you did to me was twisted, you manipulated me and my entire family. How dare you. ... For the rest of my life, I’m going to have to heal from what you did.”Watch survivor and victim Annie Labrie give her impact statement below. Another former gymnast, Tiffany Dutton, says she came forward with her story because of the “courage and bravery” of the other women who have already accused Nassar. Dutton said her mother was in the room when Nassar molested her.“It takes a monster to sexually assault a child,” she said. “But it takes a monster backed by ego, experience and power, fueled by multiple institutions, to sexually assault a child in front of their own mother.” An anonymous survivor, identified only as victim No. 124, called out MSU in her statement. “Larry you might not remember me but I certainly remember you,” an assistant to the attorney general’s office read the statement. “You ― Larry Nassar ― used and abused my body for years for your own sexual gratification. ... MSU, I’m looking at you too. Lou Anna I know you resigned but you owe me and the other survivors one hell of an apology.” Several officials at USA Gymnastics, MSU and the U.S. Olympic Committee have resigned in the face of harsh criticism. MSU President Lou Anna K. Simon resigned last week. The entire USA Gymnastics board resigned, and former Olympic coach John Geddert retired. The NCAA also opened an investigation into how MSU handled the Nassar case. On Tuesday, Congress passed a bill that aims to protect young athletes from sexual abuse and regulate governing bodies of amateur sports. Nassar’s sentence will be handed down sometime next week. "
25,ENTERTAINMENT,"At Sundance, The Films Took A Hard Look At Race In America",Matthew Jacobs,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sundance-film-festival-2018-race-movies_us_5a6ba9a7e4b0ddb658c68754,Storytellers behind seven major movies are working through the themes that haunt our national headlines.,2018-02-01,"Clockwise from left: ""Monster,"" ""Tyrel,"" ""Sorry to Bother You.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a70dfc32d00001f009433c6.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"“Representation” has become a buzzword over the past few years, often used to excoriate the limited diversity that Hollywood brings to our big screens. But, with the Sundance Film Festival come and gone, and a new year of movies revving up, it’s clear that when it comes to matters of race, popular culture has taken note of our national talking points.No fewer than seven major Sundance movies tackled race relations in America and the issues related to them ― and that’s not counting documentaries. Storytellers had police brutality (“Blindspotting,” “Monsters and Men”), wrongful imprisonment (“Monster”), the Ku Klux Klan (“Burden”), microaggressions (“Tyrel”), code-switching (“Sorry to Bother You”) and the foster care system (“Night Comes On”) on their minds.We’re witnessing a phenomenon in which socially-minded artists are processing the topics that make headlines almost daily. More than any other Sundance lineup before it, 2018′s was a heady and searing crop, aptly reflecting our national mood.One year after Jordan Peele’s “Get Out” raised the bar for veiled social commentary, “Tyrel” presents a similar premise, sending a young black man (Jason Mitchell) into the woods for a weekend getaway with a batch of white dudes. Meanwhile, “Monsters and Men” evokes the real-life killing of Eric Garner and the persecution of NFL iconoclast Colin Kaepernick, and “Burden” (which won the festival’s audience award) portrays tensions among neighbors sharing turf in the South.“Blindspotting,” a passion project co-written by “Hamilton” breakout Daveed Diggs and performance poet Rafael Casal, is a hip-hop-inflected tour through Oakland, California, where gentrification has tarnished the area’s working-class restaurants, and black residents watch white cops shoot their black neighbors at traffic lights. In “Monster,” racial profiling lands even a college-bound teenager (Kelvin Harrison Jr.) with a bright future behind bars. These movies portray a world, not unlike our own, in which only whiteness gets ahead; just ask the telemarketer Lakeith Stanfield plays in the surreal comedy “Sorry to Bother You,” who is advised to use his “white voice” if we wants to get sales.For Hollywood, indie filmmaking is a platonic ideal, painting a progressive image that puts Sundance and its ilk one step ahead of the wider industry, in terms of style, content and representation. Still, that hip image doesn’t always prioritize women and filmmakers of color. (Women helmed 37 percent of this year’s lineup ― an above-average figure that still lacks parity.) But with 2018′s movies, the festival claimed a newfound sense of topicality. The conversations unfolding on Twitter, in the media and in many Americans’ homes are resurfacing right before our eyes. Artists are doing their best to sort out the issues plaguing the country."

And it can still really mess with a woman.”",2018-02-01,"Aziz Ansari won a Golden Globe shortly before a woman spoke out about a date she had with the comedian that she described as ""the worst night of my life.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a732f112d00001f009436cd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Amy Schumer is weighing in on the allegations against friend and fellow comedian Aziz Ansari stemming from a viral story about a woman who says he coerced and pressured her for sex. Schumer doesn’t believe the piece should have career-ending consequences for the “Master of None” actor, but deems his alleged behavior as “not acceptable” in a frank conversation during a taping of the “The Katie Couric Podcast” released on Thursday.“I don’t think anyone wants to see Aziz’s career ruined or his life ruined or anything like that, but that’s where people’s minds go,” the comic told Couric. “They go, ‘Does he deserve this?’ And it’s really not about that. I think it’s about expressing and showing women that that behavior is not OK and not only can you leave, but you need to leave. Because then the women who come after you, you’re leaving a mark for them too.”“He’s been my friend and I really feel for the woman,” she added later in the conversation. “I identify with all the women in these situations. Even if it’s my friend, I don’t go, ‘Oh, but he’s a good guy.’ I think, ‘What would it feel like to have been her?’”A 23-year-old woman told the website Babe.net about a date she went on with Ansari last September, which she described as “the worst night of my life.” The woman, who used the pseudonym Grace to protect her identity, says the comedian allegedly continued to initiate a sexual encounter despite her giving “verbal and non-verbal cues to indicate how uncomfortable and distressed she was.”In a statement to HuffPost, Ansari confirmed certain details of the story but said he considered the sexual activity to be “completely consensual.”“The next day, I got a text from her saying that although ‘it may have seemed okay,’ upon further reflection, she felt uncomfortable,” the statement read. “It was true that everything did seem okay to me, so when I heard that it was not the case for her, I was surprised and concerned. I took her words to heart and responded privately after taking the time to process what she had said.”Ansari’s alleged sexual misconduct quickly launched a national conversation about what constitutes consent, and even “Saturday Night Live” aired a sketch about the story. Schumer, who’s been open about her history with sexual assault, is hopeful that this dialogue, no matter how uncomfortable, will not only continue, but spur change. “There are so many other kinds of sexual misconduct,” the “Trainwreck” actress said. “We’ve all — every woman I know, every woman in this room — we’ve all had these experiences. And in this current climate, it brings these things up and you go, ‘God, none of that was OK.’ ”“If you have a doctor that makes you uncomfortable, or you get a massage, or you have a date with someone and they coerce you in a situation like the Aziz one, I don’t think there’s any sort of criminal charge, but I think that it’s good for everybody to learn that that behavior’s not acceptable,” she continued. “It’s not a crime, but it’s not cool. And it can still really mess with a woman.”Listen to the full interview with Schumer on “The Katie Couric Podcast” below. "
27,POLITICS,Trump Was Silent On Deficits And Debt In State Of The Union Speech,Igor Bobic,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-deficits-debt-state-of-the-union_us_5a71d823e4b0be822ba25139,Fiscal conservatism takes a hit.,2018-01-31,President Donald Trump was all about spending more money in his first State of the Union address.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a71e041160000450013957c.jpeg?cache=8rSYKnmfE7&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― After years of berating Democrats over deficits and debt during Barack Obama’s presidency, Republicans have put fiscal conservatism on the back burner. In his State of the Union address Tuesday, President Donald Trump didn’t even use the word “debt” ― a striking omission for the leader of a party that until very recently opposed just about any new spending that wasn’t revenue-neutral or offset by cuts elsewhere.The only mention of the word “deficit” in Trump’s speech referred to the lack of investment in the nation’s crumbling infrastructure, which he called on lawmakers to fix by passing an eye-popping $1.5 trillion bill. He did not, however, lay out how he would pay for the legislation.Trump also raised eyebrows by urging lawmakers to “support working families by supporting paid family leave,” which is one of his older daughter’s top priorities. The U.S. is one of a handful of countries around the world that does not mandate paid family leave. Republicans consistently opposed legislation requiring employers to provide paid family leave during Obama’s tenure. “This infrastructure proposal plus a new family leave entitlement are reminders that — on fiscal conservatism — the GOP is unrecognizable: not what conservatives stood for and ran on in 2010, 2012 & 2014. This new direction is fiscally unsustainable,” tweeted Dan Senor, a former adviser to both Mitt Romney and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.).That penny-pinching may no longer be a top priority for the GOP was also evident in lawmakers’ reactions to Trump’s speech. Republicans enthusiastically cheered the many applause lines. Afterward, House Freedom Caucus Chair Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and others gushed to reporters that it may have been the “best” State of the Union address they’d ever heard.The tendency among GOP politicians to overlook deficits and debt during Republican administrations is nothing new, however. During George W. Bush’s presidency, Republicans passed two tax cuts, launched two wars, and passed a budget-busting Medicare Part D program ― all on the national credit card.“It’s a great talking point when you have an administration that’s Democrat-led,” Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.), the chairman of the Republican Study Committee, admitted last year. “It’s a little different now that Republicans have both houses and the administration.”The trend is evident in public polling as well. Since 2013, the height of the tea party movement, the share of Republican voters who say cutting the deficit ought to be a top priority has fallen more than 20 points, from 81 percent to 59 percent, according to the Pew Research Center.FreedomWorks, an influential conservative think tank that advocates for fiscal restraint and smaller government, saw many good things in Trump’s speech but added it would have liked to hear more about the budget deficit.“With the national debt now more than $20 trillion, and only projected to grow as America returns to $1 trillion budget deficits in only a few years, we need to begin to have a serious discussion about entitlement reform,” FreedomWorks President Adam Brandon said in a statement Tuesday. “This is an area where President Trump can provide leadership.”"

But there’s little public perception of a rising tide of goodwill about the nation’s political unity or its standing abroad — and even less enthusiasm for Trump himself, whose approval rating remains historically low.On the economy, nearly 70 percent of Americans say they’re satisfied, a recent NBC/Wall Street Journal survey found, the highest level since the dot-com boom. Most expect the economy to stay the same or further improve. As in previous years, however, a majority also say that the stock market performance is “an indication that corporations and the wealthy are doing better, but not necessarily the economy overall,” that survey found. And despite their positive economic views, “three in four Americans say the country is divided, six in 10 don’t have much confidence in the U.S. political system and six in 10 say racial tensions have increased,” CBS’ polling team wrote earlier this month.Just 36 percent of Americans, according to one January poll, think the United States is “mostly winning at the things it tries to do.” That poll found half of the public optimistic about the next three years, down from 56 percent when Trump was inaugurated; Quinnipiac, which asks a similar question, has found that voters’ pessimism about Trump’s presidency has outstripped optimism since last May.Trump also called for compromise. “Tonight, I call upon all of us to set aside our differences,” Trump said Tuesday, “to seek out common ground and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people we were elected to serve.”But most Americans say Trump has done more to divide than to unite the country. The percentage of U.S. adults proud to be Americans is, thanks to a plunge among Democrats, at a low since 2001.“As we rebuild America’s strength and confidence at home,” Trump said, “we are also restoring our strength and standing abroad.”Americans aren’t so sure of that. Two-thirds think that leaders of other countries “don’t have much respect” for the president, and for the first time in years, a majority now believe the nation is viewed unfavorably in the eyes of the world. They’re right: Global approval of U.S. leadership stands at just 30 percent, down 18 percentage points in a year to its lowest point in the past decade. One other polling number suggests rising hopefulness: The share of Americans who expect 2018 to be better than 2017 outstrips the share who thought that 2017 would be better than 2016. Unfortunately for Trump, that shift was driven mostly by Democrats ― many of whom say that what they’re looking forward to is the midterms congressional elections."

Joe Kennedy (D-Mass.) didn’t bring up global warming, sea-level rise or the surge in global greenhouse gas emissions, which threaten to become worse as the Republican White House ramps up fossil fuel production to unprecedented levels. The 37-year-old former prosecutor and grandson of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy (D-Mass.), who was assassinated in 1968, lamented the Trump administration’s “all-out war on environmental protection,” made a passing reference to a “coal miner” and lionized Americans with the courage to “wade through floodwaters, battle hurricanes, and brave wildfires and mudslides to save a stranger.”Yet, like Trump, the Democrat neglected critical milestones in the climate crisis in his speech. Last year marked the world’s second-hottest year on record. The U.S. racked up a record $306 billion in climate-related damages. And fossil fuel emissions hit an all-time high as the rate of carbon dioxide pollution began increasing for the first time in three years. Drew Hammill, a Democratic spokesman, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.This comes against the backdrop of Trump dismantling U.S. policies to reduce greenhouse gases and slashing funding for research. The president, who has long mocked scientists’ warnings on climate change, announced plans to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord, which has been signed by every other nation on Earth. In October, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed the repeal of the Clean Power Plan, the federal government’s only major policy to reduce emissions.In his inaugural State of the Union address, Trump declared an end to a “war on American energy.” He took credit for the boost in fossil fuel exports that began under President Barack Obama, and he celebrated the end of a “war on beautiful, clean coal,” a bizarre statement at odds with the continued closures of coal-fired plants and the high-profile failure of a carbon-capture coal plant last year. The president noted “floods and fires and storms,” but did not mention the overwhelming scientific consensus that a warming planet has made the weather events worse. The GOP remains the only major political party in the developed world to oppose the widely accepted science behind manmade global warming as a platform issue. Yet Democrats’ criticism has focused more on their opponents’ climate denialism than on policies to drastically curb emissions, leaving the party without any grand vision to address what they routinely call the greatest environmental challenge of a lifetime. A tax on carbon ― the policy proposed by Reagan-era economists and nominally supported by Big Oil ― remains the foremost idea on the table.Kennedy’s dynastic roots and impassioned speeches defending health care laws have made him a rising star in the party. While he isn’t known for his environmental stances, he earned a 96 percent lifetime score on the League of Conservation Voters’ ranking. Even the State of the Union statement issued by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), considered one of the most hawkish Democrats on climate issues, snubbed climate change. He did, however, rail against the Trump administration’s plans to open nearly all federal waters to oil and gas exploration, nothing that the proposal put “the local commercial fishing industry and the Ocean State’s coastal economy in harm’s way.”By contrast, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) pointedly skewered Trump for ignoring climate change. “How can a president of the United States give a State of the Union speech and not mention climate change?” he said in his own rebuttal. “No, Mr. Trump, climate change is not a ‘hoax.’“It is a reality which is causing devastating harm all over our country and all over the world, and you are dead wrong when you appoint administrators at the EPA and other agencies who are trying to decimate environmental protection rules and slow down the transition to sustainable energy.”Sanders is scheduled to participate in a “Climate State of the Union” on Wednesday morning hosted by the environmental group 350.org.

The change could have jeopardized worker safety and caused food safety issues.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a7227552d00001f00943583.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Apparently not all regulated industries are getting what they want out of the Trump White House.On Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that it was rejecting a petition from the poultry industry that would have allowed chicken slaughterhouses to ramp up line speeds. That USDA decision came just two weeks after the government agency proposed a rule that would allow hog plants to do away entirely with maximum line speeds. The poultry proposal came under heavy fire from consumer and work safety advocates, who argued that lifting the speed caps in slaughterhouses could endanger employees and the public because it would require faster work and less time for food safety inspections.Poultry workers and their allies even protested outside USDA headquarters recently while wearing diapers ― a nod to the fact that some plant workers say the pace is so unrelenting they don’t have enough time to use the bathroom.Those groups are now celebrating a rare regulatory victory under the Trump administration. In a letter to the poultry lobby on Tuesday, the USDA said it was not convinced that lifting the line speeds would be safe. Most plants have a maximum line speed of 140 birds per minute under USDA rules. The National Chicken Council wanted to eliminate maximum line speeds altogether for plants willing to take part in an updated inspection program.The speedup would have applied to the zone in poultry plants known as the evisceration section ― the place where the organs are removed from the bird.But safety advocates argued that if more birds are being sent down the evisceration line, then the extra work would spill over into other parts of the plant, too, like the “live hang” section where birds are prepped for killing.The maximum line speeds are supposed to allow USDA inspectors adequate time to visually examine and flag any problematic birds that need to be pulled off the line. USDA inspectors, who analyze each carcass that comes down the line, are tasked with identifying diseased birds. They also examine the birds whose feathers and intestines have already been removed for any visible fecal matter. If the line moves too fast, the worry is that a contaminated bird will make it past inspectors and potentially wind up in the food supply.“We established the [maximum] line speeds because that’s the rate at which we can verify the safety of the product,” Carmen Rottenberg, deputy administrator at the Food Safety and Inspection Service at USDA, told HuffPost. “Line speeds are set up for that purpose.” Rottenberg added that it’s not up to her agency to account for worker safety issues and that it predominantly focuses on food safety concerns.There are 20 plants that can already operate at a higher line speed ― up to 175 birds per minute, rather than 140 ― as part of a USDA pilot program. Rottenberg said other plants could seek the same waiver, and those applications would be considered on a case-by-case basis.The agency is also considering allowing faster line speeds in pork processing plants. Worker safety groups have criticized that proposal as well. They hailed the USDA’s decision to reject the proposal for poultry plants as a step in the right direction.“It’s a stunning rebuke to an industry whose business model is to increase profits by sacrificing worker safety and health,” said Debbie Berkowitz, an occupational safety expert at the National Employment Law Project, which campaigned against the proposal. “The nation’s poultry workers are a lot safer for it, as well as consumers.”The poultry industry has argued that the speed caps should be loosened. The inspectors are looking for fecal matter or blemishes that might indicate a problem with a bird, but the industry says that visual inspections don’t help identify invisible risks like salmonella. The National Chicken Council, a leading lobbying group for the poultry industry, proposed that those caps be waived altogether for plants that have opted into a revamped inspection process that was developed by the USDA.Under the industry plan, if a plant has already adapted to the USDA’s new inspection guidelines, its line speeds should be as fast as they want.Although the line speed limits are set for food safety purposes, worker advocates say they serve another important function: keeping the work pace in check. Poultry processing is a notoriously grueling and often low-paying job, often filled by refugees and immigrants. In 2010, about one-third of workers in poultry plants were made up of foreign workers, the Los Angeles Times reported last year.While injury rates in the poultry slaughtering and processing industry declined from 2004 to 2013, according to a 2016 U.S. Government Accountability Office report, many work-related injuries and illnesses often go unreported. Many workers are reluctant to come forward because they fear losing their jobs, and employers may underreport these cases because of concerns surrounding costs.Amputations are not uncommon in slaughterhouses, and many workers suffer from carpal-tunnel syndrome, nerve conditions, musculoskeletal disorders, and other repetitive motion-related ailments. Plus, there’s exposure to chemicals and pathogens. Workers in poultry plants face the same hazardous risks today that they did back in 2005, according to the GAO.In short, critics of the industry’s proposal said poultry lines already move too fast ― speeding them up would make these jobs even more hazardous.One of the most vocal opponents of removing the line speed caps was the United Food and Commercial Workers union, which represents 70,000 poultry workers in the U.S. The union called the USDA’s decision to reject the petition “a victory for hard-working poultry workers who hold one of the most dangerous and difficult jobs in America.”“It was unbelievable to see major poultry industry groups ignore these well-known risks and lobby the USDA to eliminate line speeds,” said Marc Perrone, the union’s president.When the USDA said last year it would consider the industry’s petition, the loosening of the line speeds seemed very likely. Not only has the Trump administration been taking an ax to labor and environmental rules, but both Democrats and Republicans have targeted this particular regulation in the past.USDA officials under President Barack Obama proposed allowing higher line speeds in poultry plants in 2014, prompting a backlash from worker and consumer groups that were normally on the Democrats’ side. The agency eventually shelved that plan for the remainder of Obama’s presidency, though critics expected it to be revived under the Trump administration.Even though the USDA turned down the poultry industry’s request, the agency is still considering lifting line speed caps in hog processing plants.Under a proposal floated earlier this month, the USDA would take some of the inspection responsibilities from government workers in pork plants and shift them to plant employees. The latter would be responsible for identifying and removing sickly hogs, freeing up USDA inspectors to focus on food safety issues off the processing line, like microbial testing. The USDA has called it an inspection “modernization” plan.If a plant opts into this new system, the typical speed limit ― currently 1,106 hogs per hour ― would be waived. In theory, the plant could then process hogs as fast as it wanted, so long as unfit animals were still culled from the line.The same groups that opposed lifting the line speeds in poultry plants have come out in opposition to the plan for hog plants, saying it would pose the same dangers to health and safety. The USDA said it will put the plan up for a 60-day period of public comment.“We’ll consider comments on that rule,” Rottenberg said. “Any comments we receive, will inform any final rule we move forward with on swine.”"

The pin was courtesy of Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, a New Jersey Democrat whose office had a couple hundred of the pins produced. “Recy” doesn’t have the same cachet as “MeToo” or “TimesUp.” “Recy” isn’t a movement or a cause, at least not yet. “Recy” is just a reminder of how particularly vulnerable black women are to sexual assault and of how little they have figured thus far into the broader culture’s reckoning with misogyny in all its manifestations. It’s an unfamiliar name on a button, reminding you to Google it later on. We were at a dinner Monday night in the back corner of Acadiana, a swanky Creole eatery in Northwest D.C. The event was organized by Watson Coleman, on whose invitation Gunter would be attending President Donald Trump’s first State of the Union address. Sitting around a table covered with oysters, deviled eggs and biscuits were six women who are highly respected in their fields: Fatima Graves, president of the National Women’s Law Center; Kimberly Peeler-Allen, co-founder of Higher Heights for America; Elizabeth Meyer, founder of the Women’s March on New Jersey; Beth Hubbard, a documentary film producer; Enchanta Jackson, the organizing director at Color of Change; and Watson Coleman. It was the seventh woman, Gunter, who got my attention by virtue of her silence. Many of us ― including most of the women at the dinner table ― had not heard of Recy Taylor before Oprah Winfrey name-dropped her in a speech at this year’s Golden Globe Awards. Taylor was kidnapped, blindfolded and raped at gunpoint in the back of a Chevy by six white men in 1944. The men released Taylor after she promised to stay silent about the assault. But Taylor refused to be silenced. She told her family about the assault, and soon the incident had gone national. Me too, she said, years before Gwyneth Paltrow said it. Time’s up, she said, years before Natalie Portman said it.There was nothing abnormal about Taylor’s assault or the lack of justice she and her family received afterward. In fact, the rape of black women was often a counterpart to the lynching of black men, a political tactic used to silence a community. There’s that word again. Silence. Black women have gone missing from the #MeToo conversation, a different but still disconcerting kind of silence. “The absence of black women from the spotlight of #MeToo has historical roots that predate Taylor’s rape,” wrote Soraya McDonald for “The Undefeated.” “Taylor’s story isn’t just about her. It’s about thousands of women just like her whose stories we may never know, who were victimized and brutalized without recognition or recompense for their injuries.” At dinner on Monday, Watson Coleman seemed aware of the absence. “Women are very prominent in this moment and this movement,” she said after taking a swallow of Malbec. “And we had to be very careful that it didn’t just have one face. When [black women] thought about feminism and the feminist movement, we automatically thought of other women. But we were there in it. We were being affected by it.”And black women were in some ways the cause of national feminist movements, Watson Coleman noted. After Taylor told her family what had happened to her, an investigator for the NAACP named Rosa Parks came to the small town of Abbeville, Ala., to push for prosecution of the attackers. Parks was run out of town by the sheriff. But, despite the failure to achieve any legal redress, Taylor’s assault gave rise to a national campaign against the brutal rape of black women by white men.“People don’t think of us as having suffered. People don’t think of us as having the same suffering experiences and no justice,” said Watson Coleman. “This is a classic example of that.”The conversation at the table shifted from Trump’s current policies to how things seemed a bit easier under President Barack Obama to youth engagement in politics. Throughout it all, Gunter didn’t say a word. She’d nod her head. She’d smile. She’d laugh. But she didn’t speak. Finally, Graves addressed Gunter. She said she was excited to share a table with Gunter, “especially right now when our stories are finally being told.” Gunter gave a quiet smile and a nod. “That’s that silent power,” said Hubbard. The conversation stalled as people took bites of their food. And I took my shot. “What are your thoughts on all of this?’ I asked Gunter, who cared for her aunt in her final years. “You haven’t said that much, and I’m interested in what you have to say.” “About this conversation?” she countered.“Yes, ma’am.” “It was truthful,” she said before pausing to collect her thoughts. After a few seconds, she sighed and gave me a smile.“I can’t think of what I want to say right now. I’m not a talker.” That didn’t stop the questions from flying in now that she had spoken. What would Taylor have said about the #MeToo movement, Meyer asked. “I think she’d be relieved in some way,” said Gunter. She’d be overjoyed, Gunter added, and maybe even a little satisfied.We learned Gunter didn’t know about her aunt’s rape until 2010, which sparked a conversation on how the rapes of black women are often “family secrets.” “She’d only talk about that with her baby brother,” Gunter said.“So how did you find out?” asked Meyer. “A newspaper came out when the book came out,” Gunter replied, referring to At the Dark End of the Street, a book detailing Park’s legacy as an activist and Taylor’s assault. Shortly after the book was published, Abbeville’s current mayor, the county government and the Alabama Legislature issued apologies. “Did any of the family members apologize?” asked Watson Coleman. “No.” “In fact, they really acted like it didn’t happen,” said Hubbard. “Yeah, but it did,” said Watson Coleman. Gunter nodded, and as the questions came flooding in, she kept shifting in her seat. She seemed unaccustomed to the spotlight. She preferred her silence.Not all quiet is created equal. There’s a difference between words suppressed and words withheld. On Tuesday night, Gunter will again sit in silence, dressed in all black. This time in front of a man who bragged about grabbing women “by the pussy.” A man whose presidency has been an act of aggression against people of color in general and black women in particular — black women, who suffer from higher rates of sexual and domestic violence than any other demographic, who are the fastest-growing part of the prison population, who are more likely than their white counterparts to be the sole providers for their households and to live below the poverty line. Gunter will sit silently in the face of a further assault on her rights and her aunt’s legacy, and her silence will be power."

PovichLawmakers across the country are moving quickly to legalize sports betting, wagering that the U.S. Supreme Court will allow it by session’s end and set off a race among states to cash in on contests ranging from regular-season college hoops to the Super Bowl.The Supreme Court is expected to rule on Christie v. NCAA, which could invalidate the 1992 Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, or PASPA, banning states from authorizing or licensing sports betting. New Jersey argues the law violates the 10th Amendment, which says that any powers not granted to the federal government fall to the states. And court-watchers think a majority of justices seemed inclined to agree, based on their statements during oral arguments in December.Sports betting bills have been filed in some 20 states, ranging from ones detailing exactly how the sports betting would work, to mere placeholders that would allow for specific language once the case is decided. Some bills, if passed and signed, would become law immediately upon a go-ahead ruling from the high court. Most would use existing wagering structures such as casinos or lottery commissions to oversee some form of betting on professional and college games. Some would allow on-site betting only, as at casinos or racetracks; others would allow betting remotely.The main driver, of course, is revenue. In states where lotteries, casinos and horse racing are already legal, proponents see sports betting as an extension of their wagering reach and a way to cash in on a national mania. Opponents object on moral grounds or say that gambling in general is regressive, in that the poor suffer disproportionately from gambling losses, and leads to addictions that stress state resources, for example by increasing health care and criminal justice costs.The NCAA, which runs the nation’s massive college sports system, opposes both legal and illegal sports wagering, saying in a statement it “has the potential to undermine the integrity of sports contests and jeopardizes the welfare of student-athletes and the intercollegiate athletics community.”Legal gambling in 2015 brought in $27.7 billion to local and state governments, according to estimates by the Rockefeller Institute of Government, part of the State University of New York System.A 2017 study by Oxford Economics, done for the industry group American Gaming Association, estimated that sports betting alone could become a $41.2 billion industry — including “downstream impacts” as well as spending by bettors — and contribute about $3.4 billion in taxes to state and local governments.Wagering on sports is hugely popular — annual March Madness office pools are just one example — but is mostly illegal except in Nevada. The proposed legislation wouldn’t legalize those office pools, but new laws might cut into that market with similar, but legal, betting. Many state lawmakers are concerned that if they don’t get into the sports betting market quickly, gamblers will flow to nearby states and leave theirs behind.“If we are prepared, it will boost our state’s economy, and if we’re not prepared, and the border states are, we’ll take a hit,” said state Sen. Mike Maroney, a West Virginia Republican who authored sports betting legislation that would put the state’s Lottery Commission in charge of sports betting and set a 2 percent tax on the revenue. Many lawmakers are looking to Nevada, where last year a legal $138.5 million was wagered on the Super Bowl alone.But the legal betting market is nothing compared with the potential money now changing hands through illegal wagering. The American Gaming Association, a trade research group, estimated that Americans bet $4.7 billion on last year’s Super Bowl, an 11 percent jump over 2016. According to the association, 97 percent of the bets were illegal.‘Ready to Roll’Maroney said his state’s economy relies on legal gambling revenue from casinos, horse tracks and video lottery machines. “I don’t want to draw the line in the sand and say we are allowed this kind of gambling and not the other kind of gambling,” he said, adding that nearby states of Pennsylvania and Ohio are “ready to roll. If New Jersey wins [in court] it’s going to happen.”Pennsylvania and Connecticut enacted sports betting laws late last year and are poised to get into that market if the Supreme Court allows it. Ohio, which legalized fantasy sports betting last year, is also likely to act.Border-state poaching of gamblers already is at work throughout the country. New Jersey casinos took a hit when Maryland and Pennsylvania built more in-state gambling parlors. Recently Mississippi reported that casino revenue fell in 2017, due mostly to declines in riverboat gambling-sites along the Mississippi River, as many gamblers went to racetrack casinos in Arkansas, just across the water.In most states gambling is a relatively small revenue source: It represents less than 2.5 percent of most states’ revenue, according to data from the Rockefeller Institute. But in a few states — Nevada (10.2 percent), Rhode Island (7.9 percent), Louisiana and West Virginia (6.7 percent) — its role is more significant.Lucy Dadayan, who studies gambling for the Rockefeller Institute, said states should view sports gambling revenue with caution. She predicts a boon in the early stages of a legal industry, but then a decline later. And looking at Nevada as an example, she noted that “tax revenues generated from sports betting won’t be substantial and shouldn’t be viewed as budget savers.”Sports betting makes up a small — but growing — portion of states’ gambling revenue. According to David G. Schwartz, director of the Center for Gaming Research at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, sports betting makes up just 2 percent of the revenue taken in by that state’s casinos. But in 2017, Nevada sports betting at casinos and casino-sponsored “sports books” took in $215 million, an 11.3 percent increaseover the year before.Other states are rushing to get into the game “because they need the money,” Schwartz said. But gambling revenue in general declined during the Great Recession and hasn’t come back to where it once was, he cautioned.Through sports books, gamblers register with casinos and download a wagering app on their phones. This allows them to place bets according to the point spread before games and also to participate in “dynamic wagering” during games.For some lawmakers it’s an attractive industry. In Indiana, state legislators largely followed the Nevada model. Their legislation would allow the dozen or so state-run casinos to expand into sports betting on-site, along with mobile apps.“I anticipate we’re going to see a change, a shift, in sports wagering,” said state Rep. Alan Morrison, a Republican from Terre Haute who sponsored the bill in the House (the Senate has an identical bill). “I would like Indiana to be proactive on it and be one of the first to be up and running rather than be lagging behind and see neighboring states get a jump on it.”The Indiana bill is among the more prescriptive ones, laying out fee structures, revenue predictions and a 1 percent “integrity tax” on wagers involving MLB or NBA games. That tax would go to the leagues, to pay for procedures to assure that the games are played fairly and are not “thrown” by players or anyone else.While MLB and the NBA have signed on to the plan, the NCAA, which is headquartered in Indianapolis, has not, which might mean the state wouldn’t offer wagering on college sports. Indiana has regulated fantasy sports betting, but NCAA games are excluded.West Virginia, the home of a handful of casinos, had a similar bill stall last year, but backers see a renewed energy this year because of the Supreme Court’s upcoming decision.Many states also have Native American casinos, which could be allowed to handle sports betting if the Supreme Court approves it. Indian casinos operate independently of state regulations, but generally under compacts with states that would have to be amended to accommodate sports wagering.In Rhode Island, Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo is so confident that sports betting will be approved that her proposed budget includes $23.5 million in projected revenue from the activity. A bill in Kansas would authorize sports gambling at the state’s racetracks.And in Minnesota, state Rep. Pat Garofalo, who is sponsoring a sports betting bill, said in a statement it’s time to move Minnesota’s sports gambling laws “out of the caveman era and into the 21st century.”“Hundreds of thousands of Minnesotans already wager on sports,” Garofalo, a Republican, said. “Modernizing these laws will move these activities away from” the underground economy “where citizens have few protections, and into a safe, regulated business environment.”Bucking the TrendIn other states, meanwhile, elected leaders are getting ahead of the Supreme Court to block sports gambling within their borders.A broad betting bill to allow casinos as well as sports gambling was introduced in the South Carolina Legislature last year, but it got nowhere, partially because to make gambling legal would require a constitutional amendment.Republican Gov. Henry McMaster said he’s opposed to legalization this year, even if the court rules in favor. State lawmakers’ opposition is even stronger.A bill in Mississippi would outlaw sports betting. The legislation would appear to be unnecessary, as sports betting is illegal in the state as it is. But a quirk in the state’s fantasy sports gambling law seemed to open the door to other kinds of sports gambling. Some lawmakers want to slam it shut. Another proposal, to set up a panel to study sports wagering, might keep the door ajar. Stateline home pageSign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research "

40,POLITICS,"Trump Calls North Korea 'Cruel Dictatorship,' Slams Kim As 'Depraved' In Speech",Nick Visser,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-north-korea-state-of-the-union_us_5a711983e4b0be822ba15de1,"“Past experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite aggression.""",2018-01-31,"“You are powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens our world, and your strength inspires us all,” Trump told the parents of American student Otto Warmbier at the 2018 State of the Union address.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a712ccc1600004500139460.jpeg?cache=zEAYpbetie&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump singled out the “cruel dictatorship” of North Korea during his State of the Union address on Tuesday, calling its leader, Kim Jong Un, a “depraved character” and “menace that threatens our world” while touting his administration’s efforts to prevent the country from developing nuclear weapons capable of reaching the United States.Trump devoted a large segment of his address to criticizing the regime, casting the diplomatic efforts of prior administrations as insufficient, and once again slammed his predecessors as too soft on the Kim regime, saying they “invited aggression.”“Past experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite aggression and provocation,” Trump said. “I will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations that got us into this very dangerous position.”The president pointed to the parents of American student Otto Warmbier, who died last June after he was returned to the U.S. following his imprisonment in North Korea, as evidence of Kim’s brutality.“You are powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens our world, and your strength inspires us all,” he said.Trump’s hard-line stance comes the same day The Washington Post reported that the White House pulled the likely nomination of a respected foreign policy expert to be the U.S. ambassador to South Korea, a key diplomatic position that has been vacant for more than a year. Victor Cha was widely expected to be nominated, but his name was reportedly withdrawn from consideration after Cha expressed concerns over policy decisions related to North Korea, including U.S. consideration of a limited strike on the country in what has been called the “bloody nose” strategy.Cha confirmed late Tuesday that his name was no longer under consideration.Officials had hoped an envoy would be in place before the start of the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang next month.Tensions between North and South Korea have appeared to thaw in recent weeks after Kim offered an olive branch to Seoul on New Year’s Day, saying he would open diplomatic channels between the two countries for the first time in years. Pyongyang later agreed to send athletes to the Olympics in February and said it would hold military talks with the South in an effort to improve relations on the Korean peninsula.Trump took much of the credit for the diplomacy, asking on Twitter earlier this month: “Does anybody really believe that talks and dialogue would be going on between North and South Korea right now if I wasn’t firm, strong and willing to commit our total ‘might’ against the North.”“Fools, but talks are a good thing!” he concluded.South Korean President Moon Jae-In agreed with his U.S. counterpart, saying he gave “a lot of credit to President Trump” and that he wanted to express his “gratitude.”The two Koreas are expected to send their first joint team to the Olympics next month, the women’s ice hockey squad."
41,LATINO VOICES,FEMA Now Says It's Not Ending Aid For Puerto Rico Hurricane Survivors,Carolina Moreno,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fema-now-says-not-ending-puerto-rico-aid_us_5a7216c1e4b05253b2752d18,The agency gave unclear and at times contradictory statements about aid over the past two days as outrage grew in the wake of an NPR report.,2018-01-31,"A U.S. Army soldier tosses bottled water, provided by FEMA, to be passed on to residents in a neighborhood without grid electricity or running water in Puerto Rico on Oct. 17.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a723c951600004500139634.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Federal Emergency Management Agency officials said Wednesday the agency was not cutting off aid to hurricane victims in Puerto Rico, walking back statements one of their officials made in an incendiary NPR report on Monday. In an interview with the outlet, a FEMA official said that food and water provisions to the island would “officially shut off” on Wednesday. But following an ensuing public outcry, which included Puerto Rican officials, the agency released a statement on Wednesday saying there was never a decision made to end aid to the island. “FEMA and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico are not stopping the provision of commodities after Hurricane Maria,” FEMA Public Affairs Director William Booher confirmed in the statement to HuffPost. “FEMA and the Commonwealth will continue to provide commodities to voluntary organizations and local officials who still have a need.” “There is no decision to stop distribution of commodities,” the statement continued. “As progress continues from response to recovery across the island, we will continue to support the needs of survivors supporting the government of Puerto Rico.”Booher told The New York Times on Wednesday that the Jan. 31 deadline was mistakenly publicized by the agency in the NPR interview. The date, he said, actually marked an internal planning date to evaluate if the U.S. territory still needed aid.Booher also reiterated that the “aid is not stopping” and insisted the agency was not backtracking on a decision. FEMA’s newest statement, however, comes after two days of widespread backlash. San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz slammed FEMA over the possibility of ending aid to Puerto Rico at the Latino Victory Summit on Tuesday. Cruz pointed to citizens on the island who still have no power, no water and no financial stability. Nearly 30 percent of Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority subscribers are still without electricity as of Wednesday, according to government data. Booher’s statement to the Times on Wednesday echoed what FEMA spokesman Daniel Llargues told HuffPost the day before.He said the information the FEMA official provided NPR was not false but also “not completely accurate.”“Nothing is changing on the 31st,” Llargues told HuffPost on Tuesday. “If it’s changing in days or weeks to come, it’s because it has been requested with local officials”“Some municipalities don’t need it any longer,” he continued. “Some that don’t have running water or power, we’ll continue to supply commodities to them, always in coordination with state and local officials.”In a somewhat unclear statement to HuffPost on Tuesday, the agency said both that “FEMA provided commodities are no longer needed for emergency operations” and that “FEMA will continue to support any identified needs.”“The commercial supply chain for food and water is re-established and private suppliers are sufficiently available that FEMA provided commodities are no longer needed for emergency operations,” Booher said in the Tuesday statement. “FEMA will continue to support the Government of Puerto Rico to meet the needs they identify.” “FEMA will continue to support any identified needs and will provide supplies to volunteer agencies and other private non-profit organizations who are working with households in rural, outlying areas to address ongoing disaster related needs as power and water is gradually restored,” he added.FEMA’s Wednesday statement does not explicitly say whether there will be any changes in distribution or quantity of aid for the island. State Coordinating Officer and Secretary of the Department of Public Safety Héctor Pesquera released a statement on Wednesday addressing what occurred after initial reports said FEMA would end aid to the island. “We immediately established communication with FEMA’s operations coordinator for Puerto Rico, Mike Byrne, to clarify the situation,” he said in statement to HuffPost. “After the conversation, both teams agreed that at no time had it been agreed upon to begin the transfer of FEMA’s responsibilities to the Government of Puerto Rico as part of the transition process from the response phase to the recovery phase.” “We are confident that FEMA will continue to provide the help that is necessary,” he continued. “Agreements between the federal government and the local government are focused on supporting the people who remain in need after Hurricane Maria.” Sarah Ruiz-Grossman contributed to this report.

42,QUEER VOICES,New 'Queer Eye' Guys Reveal How They'd Make Over Donald Trump,Michelangelo Signorile,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/queer-eye-donald-trump-makeover_us_5a7091d6e4b0a6aa4873a732,"“Well, maybe just a gorgeous facial hair moment to, like ― hide...""",2018-01-31,"The new cast of ""Queer Eye,"" coming to Netflix on Feb. 7.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a71cfd51600002000139535.jpeg?cache=gwAirdZ6r0&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A makeover of President Donald Trump proved to be a bit of a challenge even for the new “Fab Five,” the cast of the reboot of “Queer Eye for the Straight Guy,” the groundbreaking show that premiered on Bravo in 2003 and ran through 2007.But the new cast persevered, offering their suggestions on making Trump great again (even if he hadn’t actually been great before) in an interview with me on SiriusXM Progress this week.The original “Queer Eye” featured five gay style gurus based in New York who taught straight men about fashion, design and culture and helped spark a new genre in makeover shows.Debuting on Netflix on Feb. 7, the new “Queer Eye” has the cast headquartered in Atlanta, with the group of style experts heading into red-state America. The show’s design guru, Bobby Berk, noted that “the old show was ‘Queer Eye for the Straight Guy’” while “the new show is just ‘Queer Eye’” ― and that’s for a reason.“We’re out there not just focusing on straight guys, telling straight guys what they need to do different,” he explained. “We’re out there helping everyone ― straight guys, trans guys, gay guys, women. And [we] really just want to not just go out and create a bunch of metrosexuals ― just teaching guys how to groom. It’s more about transforming them, not just on the outside.”So, on to a proposed Trump makeover.After a few sighs, some laughter and an “Oh, God!” from the group, the show’s grooming guru, Jonathan Van Ness, plunged in.“Sticking with my vertical, I would say, I... ugh, um.” He paused. “Well, maybe just a gorgeous facial hair moment to, like ― hide. You know, give him a little roughness. And make him not like such a freshly-shaven baby head – who is wreaking havoc! Oh, and a lace front [wig]. A nice, dork, natural JFK moment.”The show’s culture expert, Karamo Brown, would take Trump “to a small village in Mexico where he’s trying to build this damned wall.”“And I would say, ‘Let’s go ahead and put you in front of these people,’” Brown said, “‘and I want you to look at them in their eyes and tell them, truly, that you really think they are criminals and rapists.’”“First of all, I would get rid of some of the gold!” exclaimed Berk, the show’s design expert. “All this flashiness. I mean, he is clearly trying to make up for things that aren’t quite adequate, you know, by coating everything in gold.”Food and wine expert Antoni Porowski said he’s “thinking about poor Melania and poor little Barron.”“I don’t know if he ever has, but teach him how to make a meal for his family and show up,” Porowski said. “Because she’s been put through the wringer.”Fashion stylist Tan France, however, said he wouldn’t do much at all.“I haven’t got much bad to say about him,” France confessed to gasps from the rest of the cast. Pushing back, France added, “The only thing I would say is that he needs to get an actual tailor. I think he’s going to God knows where —”Berk interjected: “No, it’s because of his diapers. They make his pants poofy.”In case it’s not evident, a key difference about the new “Queer Eye” is that the new “Fab Five” weigh in on cultural and political issues of the day and get into charged discussions with their “heroes,” as they call their makeover subjects. (France, who is Muslim, is outspoken about being married to a Mormon cowboy.) The show’s creator, David Collins, explained recently that while the earlier “Queer Eye” was about “tolerance,” the new version is about “acceptance.”“Where gay men were in 2003, when the show originally came out, is not where we are in 2018,” Brown, who is African-American, said. “I think the beauty of what we are doing now as a cast is not only that we are diverse, but we’re bringing our true selves and our lives to the show, which is great.”“I don’t think anyone’s ever seen an openly gay Muslim man on television being this proud, and for him to go into the South, that’s obviously going to be [a] conversation,” he continued. “And I think that’s what we all do so well. We have these culturally relevant conversations in a way that is not going to turn people off, but is going to invite them into our community and say, ‘Hey, let’s have some fun, but let’s also learn.’”Pointing to why “Queer Eye” could be even more relevant in 2018, France added: “I think before, we were very much sticking to a whitewashed version. It wasn’t so much diverse. You wouldn’t really talk about our personal lives in the old show, whereas now you find out so much about us.”In Trump’s America, even if the president himself doesn’t get his much-needed makeover, that can only be a good thing.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article said the new “Queer Eye” debuts on Feb. 8. In fact, it debuts on Feb. 7."

Publix, he said, denied the request. “We’ve started over 400 people on PrEP at our clinic alone, and this is the only person that we weren’t able to get PrEP for,” said Holland, who is also an assistant professor of medicine at Emory University.Although the employee, who was not identified, attempted to appeal the decision, the request was rejected two more times, much to Holland’s surprise. “What we found out from the insurance company was that it came, ultimately, from the employer,” he said. “It wasn’t just an insurance issue; it was [that] the employer did not want it covered in the insurance.”According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, daily use of PrEP can reduce the risk of contracting HIV from sex by more than 90 percent. Medical sources estimate that the out-of-pocket cost of the drug without insurance can be as high as $13,000 per year. Publix didn’t immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. However, spokeswoman Brenda Reid told The Body, “Annually, we evaluate benefits covered under our health plans. There are numerous medications covered by the plan used in the treatment of HIV.”She added, “There are some medications that have coverage limitations or require prior authorization.”The response from the Lakeland, Florida-based company has prompted some speculation that it refused to cover PrEP on moral grounds, discriminating against gay and bisexual men, who remain disproportionately susceptible to HIV infection. (It is not known whether the employee who requested the drug identifies as LGBTQ.) When it comes to LGBTQ rights, Publix has a checkered history at best. The chain, which comprises 1,169 stores in seven Southern states, received a score of zero in the Human Rights Campaign’s 2018 Corporate Equality Index, which is used as a benchmarking tool for LGBTQ workplace equality. Because Publix was one of the few Fortune 500 companies that didn’t respond to the group’s request for information, however, that rating was deemed “unofficial” in the HRC survey."

Yet the company is standing by two other men also embroiled in misconduct accusations and related lawsuits. The company’s head of music marketing, Brent Hamilton, is awaiting trial on felony charges for allegedly strangling his ex-girlfriend. Phillip Deitrich, another manager, stands accused of bullying a female subordinate in front of her male colleagues and sabotaging her ability to work.Both men still work at Monster. The female Monster employees involved lost their jobs.Kenneally, a 60 year-old Atlanta-based executive named in two sexual discrimination lawsuits filed last year against the drinkmaker, was gone by Friday, according to one current and one former employee at Monster Energy. A spokesman for Monster would only confirm that the company “accepted his resignation,” meaning it didn’t implore him to stay.His interim replacement is Andrew Wilkinson, another executive at Monster, the company confirmed. A former female employee’s lawsuit describes Wilkinson as enabling Kenneally’s behavior.During his time at Monster, Kenneally started up a romance with a colleague, Page Zeringue, convincing her to take a promotion working for him. When their relationship soured, he turned abusive, sending her lengthy text messages in which he called her a “bitch” and a “whore” and once made a racially charged comment about “black dicks.” He eventually helped engineer Zeringue’s firing, according to her lawsuit.HuffPost published those texts, shocking many current and former employees, who said they hadn’t been aware of the extent of Kenneally’s misconduct. Zeringue, who remains unemployed, was only slightly mollified by the news.“This is only a small step towards greater justice,” Zeringue told HuffPost in an email. “John was enabled by the founders of Monster ― Rodney Sacks and Hilton Schlosberg ― who routinely turned a blind eye to internal abuse while people such as us lost our jobs, life savings, and our futures.” A Monster spokesman disputed some of Zeringue’s claims when HuffPost reached him on Wednesday. “Messrs. Sacks and Schlosberg,” the spokesman said in a statement, “Take these issues seriously.”“Monster Energy has zero-tolerance for discrimination or harassment of any kind,” the company said in a statement to HuffPost. “If the company’s discrimination and harassment policies are violated, appropriate action is taken, up to and including termination of employment.”“It is also worth noting that Mr. Kenneally’s resignation was accepted by the Company,” the statement says.Kenneally was on paid leave pending an internal investigation after HuffPost contacted Monster earlier this month about its forthcoming article. The company, which is partly owned by Coca-Cola, also said the lawsuits women filed against Monster ― five in total ― are unrelated and without merit.A spokesman for Coca-Cola declined to comment on these cases. He did say that the company recently reminded its own employees of its policies on harassment and discrimination and its commitment to not retaliating if someone comes forward to report abuse.The departure of a single man accused of misconduct hardly suggests a culture shift at Monster, a drink company that markets primarily to men, promotes itself with “Girls” dressed in skimpy outfits, makes a beverage called Assault and once produced a Monster-branded condom labeled “unleash the beast.” It’s notable that the company has not chosen to discipline the other men named in these suits. Fran Pulizzi, a former business development manager at the company who also sued Monster over Kenneally’s behavior, alleged in her own lawsuit that Kenneally’s interim replacement, Wilkinson, helped enable Keneally’s misconduct.Pulizzi became the target of vicious retaliation after she reported Kenneally’s actions to Monster’s human resources department, according to her lawsuit, which said that Kenneally directed colleagues to stop working with her and addressed her in abusive and derogatory ways. Pulizzi told HuffPost that Keneally also spread harmful rumors about her personal life.Wilkinson was Pulizzi’s direct supervisor for a few months while this retaliation was ongoing, her suit says. And though he was initially sympathetic to her situation, something quickly changed, according to Pulizzi’s lawsuit. Wilkinson stopped returning her calls and emails, she told HuffPost. He also gave Pulizzi a poor performance review after working with her for only a few months, possibly at Kenneally’s urging, according to the suit.It’s upsetting that the company replaced one man, credibly accused of sexual harassment, with another man who enabled that behavior, Pulizzi told HuffPost. “It tells me nothing’s changed at Monster,” she said.Still, Pulizzi and Zeringue are hopeful that by speaking up about their experiences, something will change.“In the last week, we have heard from scores of Monster employees who are too afraid to speak up,” Zeringue said. “We hope that our continued attempt to seek justice ― will help alleviate their fears.”Do you have a story about harassment or discrimination that you’d like to share?

The mainstream media and the television pundits will surely deem it to be a presidential moment, representative of yet another pivot to the center.But one speech does not erase Trump’s record. The speech’s banality — its embrace of optimism and platitude — is a mask. Do not be fooled: Political extremism, divisive rhetoric and bizarre behavior have characterized the first year of Trump’s presidency and underlie many of the harmless-sounding proposals he talked about Tuesday night.This is the president, recall, who rose to political power on the racist lie that his predecessor was born in Kenya, and he ran for president while calling to ban all Muslims from the country and deriding Mexican immigrants as rapists. He was slow to denounce white nationalists, who have looked to him as a leader and marched openly in the streets of this country. And since last summer, this president has launched an all-out war on the investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election — a war that continued to rage this week. Trump mentioned none of those facts in his State of the Union address. Indeed, the speech was most notable for all of the policies and initiatives of his administration that he downplayed or left out entirely. On immigration, his signature issue, the president called for compromise on the status of undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. But he failed to mention that the crisis that has beset these immigrants, known as Dreamers, is one of his own making. Last year, Trump canceled Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), which granted Dreamers renewable two-year deportation protections and work permits. Thousands of them have already lost their protections. Trump also didn’t talk about his unilateral cancellation of protected status for hundreds of thousands of Haitians, Nicaraguans, Salvadorans and Sudanese — people who have lived in the U.S. for years and will now have to leave. And he didn’t mention his three attempts to ban people from Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S, the third attempt of which is due for a U.S. Supreme Court ruling later this year.On the economy, Trump bragged about job growth and the Republican tax cut bill, but he didn’t mention that those tax cuts were overwhelmingly tilted toward the wealthy and corporations. He argued that the country is undergoing a “new American moment” under his presidency, promising, “There has never been a better time to start living the American dream.” He talked about bonuses and wage gains, but he certainly didn’t mention that the richest 5 percent of taxpayers would see the largest percentage increase in after-tax income under the law.On defense, Trump bragged about U.S. success in the war against ISIS. But he didn’t mention that if he gets his way, transgender members of the military won’t be able to serve openly. On North Korea, Trump described his policy against the hermit kingdom as “waging a campaign of maximum pressure” to prevent Kim Jong Un’s regime from acquiring nuclear weapons. That sounds like a reasonable — even presidential — thing to say. But it obscures the fact that Trump’s actual policy toward North Korea has been erratic and ineffective. Last year, North Korea tested a missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland. Instead of pushing for nuclear negotiations, the Trump administration is reportedly considering a preemptive strike against North Korea — which nonproliferation experts say would do little to deter the rogue state’s nuclear ambitions and would put millions in South Korea at risk of a retaliatory attack. Hours before Trump’s speech, The Washington Post reported that the Trump administration had dropped Victor Cha, a former White House official, from consideration to become the U.S. ambassador to South Korea because he had warned of the risks of a so-called “bloody nose” attack on North Korea. On Iran, Trump asked Congress to “address the fundamental flaws in the terrible Iran deal.” Left unsaid was the fact that Washington’s European allies have already said they will not cooperate with an effort to unilaterally rewrite the terms of the Iran deal. The best-case scenario is that the U.S. ends up isolated as Iran, France, Germany, Britain, China and Russia continue abiding by the nuclear deal. The worst-case scenario is that Iran points to a U.S. violation of the agreement as an excuse to scrap the deal entirely and resumes production of weapons-grade nuclear material. And although Trump praised protesters in Iran “who rose up against the crimes of their corrupt dictatorship” and congratulated himself for voicing his support for the movement, he didn’t mention that he has spent months fighting in court to ban Iranians — protesters or otherwise — from entering the U.S. at all.On nuclear weapons, the president suggested that “someday in the future there will be a magical moment when the countries of the world will get together and eliminate their nuclear weapons.” But privately Trump has expressed a desire for a nearly tenfold increase in the U.S. nuclear arsenal, NBC reported last year. His administration is now pursuing the development of new low-yield nuclear weapons, according to a leaked copy of the Nuclear Posture Review obtained by HuffPost. On Guantanamo Bay, Trump actually described his policy: an executive order that effectively reverses his predecessor’s commitment to closing the offshore prison. But he managed to avoid threatening to send American citizens to the prison where an ad-hoc judicial system has replaced what most Americans would consider due process. And he made no mention of his past threat to restart a now-defunct torture program. On social issues, Trump said hardly anything. His administration is no longer standing behind transgender students who want to use the restroom of their choosing, but you wouldn’t know from listening to his speech. He didn’t mention his support for a ban on all abortions after 20 weeks’ gestation or his decision to reinstate the Reagan-era global ban on funding organizations that offer abortion as a family planning option or Republicans’ multiple attempts to defund Planned Parenthood. He touted “faith and family” as the “center of the American life” but faces sexual misconduct allegations from a number of women — and he backed a Senate candidate who had been accused of sexually pursuing teenage girls.The mood in the chamber ― at least on the GOP side ― resembled a monster truck rally. Republicans said they loved the speech. They enthusiastically cheered the many applause lines. They hooted. They hollered. They chanted “U-S-A,” with Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) pumping his fist to the rhythm of the cheer and Rep. Jody Hice (R-Ga.) holding up a red “Make America great again” hat.But on the Democratic side, many sat when Trump entered the chamber. Many others spent a considerable amount of time on their phones as the speech became the third-longest State of the Union ever delivered, at one hour, 20 minutes and 34 seconds.Democrats hissed during some of Trump’s claims. One line that will likely stick in memory will be his assertion that “a single immigrant” could bring in “virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives” through family reunification. And the only reason it will be remembered is because it is so brazenly dishonest in a speech that contained a number of misleading claims, such as the GOP tax cut being the largest of all time. (It’s not.)Hanging over the whole speech, but never acknowledged, was special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and what role Trump and his associates played in any sort of collusion. Trump mentioned Russia briefly, only once, as a “rival” that challenges U.S. interests. But during the election, Trump’s campaign saw Russia as a potential ally. At campaign events, he repeatedly praised President Vladimir Putin and said he longed for a U.S. president who acted more like the strongman. The Russia investigation is a constant in the White House. Mueller has already indicted four people connected to Trump, and the probe gets closer and closer to the president and whether he tried to obstruct justice by firing the FBI director. And it continues to shape, and undermine, the other actions Trump takes as president. Trump said a lot — his speech was one of the longest State of the Union addresses ever. But what he didn’t say tells you everything.Jenavieve Hatch contributed reporting"
48,POLITICS,Democratic Party Think Tank Quietly Fighting Push To Restore Net Neutrality Rules,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/net-neutrality-progressive-policy-institute_us_5a70f13ee4b0be822ba143f4,"""The Progressive Policy Institute has a history of bending over backwards to do whatever large phone and cable companies ask it to do,"" one critic said.",2018-01-31,A message shared by a Twitter user as part of the Progressive Policy Institute's influence campaign.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a70f2602d00001f009433de.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― A Democratic Party think tank is behind a shadowy social media campaign pressuring Democratic lawmakers to oppose congressional resolutions to bring back net neutrality rules.In the past two weeks, individual Democratic Party lawmakers have received Twitter messages from hundreds of different users urging them to oppose two resolutions that would nullify the Federal Communications Commission’s December vote to end net neutrality rules for internet service providers. Democrats, digital companies and open internet advocates have harshly criticized the FCC decision.Both resolutions received wide support from Democrats. The one offered by Rep. Mike Doyle (D-Pa.) in the House has 110 co-sponsors, all Democrats. A bill in the Senate from Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) is endorsed by all 49 members of the Democratic caucus, as well as Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine).The Twitter messages encouraged lawmakers to drop their support of the resolutions, which were offered under the Congressional Review Act (CRA), and to pass a bipartisan net neutrality bill instead; something that does not exist at this moment.But rather than an organic expression of policy preferences by disparate Twitter users, the wave of messages started as an online advertising campaign by the Progressive Policy Institute, a centrist think tank affiliated with the Democratic Party that has consistently opposed net neutrality regulations imposed by the FCC.Lindsay Mark Lewis, executive director of the Progressive Policy Institute, told HuffPost that the advocacy campaign is meant to target “pragmatic Members of Congress” in pursuit of a “real legislative solution” to net neutrality. Lewis called the Doyle and Markey bills “nothing but a gesture without a solution.” He added that the think tank has long supported a legislative solution to the net neutrality issue, something that Democrats and Republicans in Congress have never agreed on.It is not easy for a casual Twitter user to determine that they might be taking part in the Progressive Policy Institute’s political advertising campaign. The message commonly shared by Twitter users does not note any connection to the think tank. Also, none of the original advertisements appear in the think tank’s official Twitter feed, since Twitter allows advertisers to hide their purchased posts from the general public so that only users targeted by the ads will see them.Supporters of the Doyle and Markey bills, however, believe the Progressive Policy Institute is operating on behalf of internet service providers like AT&T, Comcast and Verizon. (Verizon is the parent company of the corporation that owns HuffPost.) These companies have funded the opposition to net neutrality rules for years and backed the FCC’s recent decision to repeal them.The Progressive Policy Institute “has a history of bending over backwards to do whatever large phone and cable companies ask it to do,” Tim Karr, a senior director at Free Press, a pro-net neutrality nonprofit group, told HuffPost.Free Press and other net neutrality advocates point to the Progressive Policy Institute’s longtime opposition to FCC net neutrality rules and its publication of dubious reports on the cost of net neutrality that internet service providers have used to defend their lobbying against net neutrality.Net neutrality advocates also find the Progressive Policy Institute’s Twitter campaign suspect because it came just as the internet service providers launched a lobbying campaign for what the advocates deem a “fake” net neutrality bill.AT&T ran full-page ads in The New York Times and The Washington Post on Jan. 24, calling for Congress to pass bipartisan net neutrality legislation. That version of net neutrality, however, would be riddled with loopholes that allow practices like paid prioritization, in which websites can pay service providers to move their content faster than the content of their competition. Legislation introduced by Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) is very similar to what AT&T wants. Lewis told HuffPost that the Progressive Policy Institute does not support Blackburn’s bill.“These types of astroturf campaigns are extremely dangerous because they hide the fact that they are corporate lobbying and mislead lawmakers into thinking that there is real constituent support for terrible and unpopular policies pushed by big businesses,” Evan Greer, campaign director at the pro-net neutrality Fight for the Future, told HuffPost in an email.Karr says that the only thing you need to look at is the think tank’s donors, which, he says, “includes extensive support from the broadband lobby.” The Progressive Policy Institute, through its parent nonprofit the Third Way Foundation, has received five- and six-figure contributions from the major trade associations affiliated with AT&T, Comcast and Verizon, including U.S. Telecom, National Cable & Telecommunications Association and CTIA - The Wireless Association. Each of these trade groups vigorously opposed the Obama-era FCC’s net neutrality rules. (The Third Way Foundation has no relation to the think tank Third Way.)Lewis said the Progressive Policy Institute supports net neutrality legislation “that confirms the open internet and aggressively deals with paid prioritization, beyond what any ISP likely would want.” He added, “We would like to see a real bipartisan effort to affirm the rules for the internet that can be defined for a generation.”The Progressive Policy Institute spent “very little” on the initial advertisements to oppose the bills, Lewis said, and that the campaign was funded out the organization’s general support fund, which the industry trade groups have contributed to in the past. He did not respond to questions about whether the group received donations from telecommunications companies or their trade groups this or last year.This story has been updated to include information about the think tank Third Way."

A Gaetz spokeswoman on Wednesday confirmed the invite to HuffPost. Gaetz told The Daily Beast Johnson showed up at his office the day of the speech asking for a ticket. Johnson said several members of Congress invited him, but he took Gaetz’s ticket.Johnson said he had a “wild time” at the speech.“I certainly did a bunch of jumping out of my chair,” Johnson told The Daily Beast. “Trump was straight-up gangster.”Johnson’s website, GotNews, is known for a wide range of false and dangerous writing, and promotes itself with the tagline: “President Trump reads us. You should too.”In 2014, he falsely accused a New York Times reporter of posing for Playgirl. That same year, he published the name and photo of a person he claimed had falsely reported a rape (The photo, taken off Pinterest, showed the wrong person). He maintains that former President Barack Obama is “clearly gay,” and described Eric Garner, the unarmed black man who died in a New York police chokehold, as a “street thug.” Johnson said he identifies with the “alt-right.”Gaetz also has shown a fondness for conspiracy theories. On Monday, he went on Alex Jones’ InfoWars broadcast to claim Special Counsel Robert Muller’s investigation into the Trump campaign’s alleged ties with Russia “is built on a rotten foundation,” and will soon turn to Hillary Clinton."
50,POLITICS,"Trump Spent 49 Seconds Of SOTU On Overdose Crisis That Claimed 64,000 Lives In A Year",Jason Cherkis and Nick Wing,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-opioids-state-of-the-union_us_5a710f6ce4b0be822ba15d39,"One Democratic candidate in opioid-ravaged Ohio clocked Trump's remarks and said it's clear the president ""has no plan.""",2018-01-31,President Donald Trump barely mentioned the opioid crisis in his State of the Union address Tuesday night.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a713f631600004500139466.jpeg?cache=GmRCMfBtJ3&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump briefly mentioned the opioid epidemic during his State of the Union speech on Tuesday night, suggesting he’d address the matter through immigration reform and tougher drug enforcement.“We must get much tougher on drug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this scourge,” Trump said. “My administration is committed to fighting the drug epidemic and helping get treatment for those in need, for those who have been so terribly hurt. The struggle will be long and it will be difficult ― but, as Americans always do, in the end, we will succeed, we will prevail.”During his speech, Trump also paused for applause for one of his guests, Ryan Holets, an Albuquerque, New Mexico, police officer who, along with this wife, adopted a baby from a pregnant homeless mother struggling with opioid addiction. Their baby girl, Hope, now 3 months old, was also in attendance.Trump’s rhetoric echoed his comments from the earliest days of his presidential campaign in 2015 when he visited places hit hard by the opioid crisis. Despite his tough talk, Trump has taken little action to address the epidemic as president, and it has showed no sign of slowing since he took office.Rob Jarvis, a Democratic candidate running for congress in Ohio, a state ravaged by opioids, timed how long Trump spent on the crisis in tonight’s speech. “We got about 49 seconds,” he reported to HuffPost. And most of what Trump said, he noted, was fear-based. “Where was the plan to actually improve the treatment?” he wondered. Or the plan to address the drug companies who helped spur the epidemic through their prescription painkillers. “Should I be happy that he mentioned it? Or should I be upset that he has no plan?” Jarvis said. He decided he was upset.“I think it’s on the back burner,” Jarvis said. He added that residents in his district have all but given up hope of an adequate response from Trump. “I think the best word is despondent,” he said. “The idea of hope right now in our region of the state is not something that people talk about much. Everybody knows somebody that has a substance abuse problem. You are past the point of anger. We feel broken. We feel abandoned.”Ohio’s overdose deaths spiked in 2017, rising by 41 percent between May 2016 and May 2017. Drug overdoses claimed roughly 64,000 lives in the United States in 2016, with the vast majority related to opioids, helping to drive the average American life expectancy down in back-to-back years for the first time since the 1960s. With the crisis showing no signs of abating in 2017, experts predict it will be the third consecutive year of declining longevity, which hasn’t happened in nearly a century, since the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918.Critics have seen Trump’s response to the crisis as slow and muddled. Last spring, Trump created an opioid commission to study the epidemic and make recommendations. Many of its proposals were aimed at organizing a public health response to those suffering from opioid addiction. Trump spent most of the past year unsuccessfully pushing to repeal Obamacare ― which would mean tens of thousands of addicts would have lost access to drug treatment. The commission’s final report was released in early November. “The time to wait is over. The time for talk is passed,” wrote Chris Christie (R), then the governor of New Jersey and chairman of the commission, in a letter addressed to Trump accompanying the panel’s report. “175 deaths a day can no longer be tolerated. We know that you will not stand by; we believe you will force action.”The 138-page document outlines dozens of recommendations across a variety of areas, including drug prevention and treatment strategies, law enforcement and education. The report itemizes federal drug control spending by function, and notes that Trump’s proposed 2018 budget would increase funding on interdiction by 10 percent, while cutting prevention spending by 11 percent.The commission also identifies the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy as a key player in the battle against the opioid epidemic. But it’s not clear the Trump administration agrees. The president has yet to nominate a full-time drug czar to lead the ONDCP, and a 24-year-old former campaign staffer had reportedly been running many of the agency’s operations until earlier this month, when he announced plans to step aside amid scrutiny of his work history and résumé. Trump has also reportedly floated the possibility of slashing ONDCP’s budget by 95 percent and shifting its key responsibilities to other departments.All of these actions have led to questions about whether the White House is taking the opioid epidemic seriously enough. “I think they have highlighted the issue by appointing a commission and having [the Department of Health and Human Services] issue a health emergency,” said Regina LaBelle, the ONDCP’s chief of staff during President Barack Obama’s administration. “But little of substance has been done on the issue to date.”Trump formally designated a public health emergency for the crisis in October. The move came two months after his commission recommended he instead declare a full-on national emergency, which would have opened up billions of dollars of funding. The public health emergency fund currently holds only about $57,000, which amounts to 2 cents for each individual in the U.S. struggling with opioid addiction, according to the progressive nonprofit Drug Policy Alliance.With the White House recently estimating that the true cost of the opioid epidemic topped $500 billion in 2015, critics have accused the administration of dedicating insufficient attention and resources to the crisis. Even during his address on Tuesday, Trump spent far more time discussing other issues, including a handful of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants over the past few years.“His SOTU remarks ring hollow ― no new proposals, no call for substantial new resources,” said Daniel Raymond, policy director at the Harm Reduction Coalition. “If Trump were running a corporation to end this crisis, shareholders looking for results would be ready to oust him.”Although Trump’s opioid commission has put forth some positive proposals, they won’t bear results unless the president funds them adequately, said Dr. Yngvild Olsen, medical director of the Institutes for Behavior Resources in Baltimore.“The resources need to be there to fully implement the good ideas — particularly the ones that focus on expanding access to evidence-based treatment and increasing support for people and families struggling with addiction,” Olsen said. “For this we need more than just the outrage the president expressed in his State of the Union address tonight.”CORRECTION: The headline in a previous version of this story indicated there were 64,000 opioid-related deaths in 2016. That number includes all overdose deaths."

After praising Sharp for a “job well done,” Trump said the boy was also a reminder that all Americans should stand for the national anthem.“Young patriots like Preston teach all of us about our civic duty as Americans,” Trump said during the speech. “Preston’s reverence for those who have served our nation reminds us why we salute our flag, why we put our hands on our hearts for the Pledge of Allegiance, and why we proudly stand for the national anthem.” He put a ham’s emphasis to that last phrase, which was written in all-caps on the version of the speech distributed to reporters, and then grinned.It was a subtler version of the same attack Trump has leveled in the past at athletes and other figures in sports ― all of them black ― who kneeled or protested during the national anthem before NFL games last fall, or who otherwise criticized him. Last year, Trump called on NFL owners to fire any “son of a bitch” who protested before a game; his press secretary also called for the firing of ESPN anchor and journalist Jemele Hill after she called the president a “white supremacist.”While the language may have changed, Trump is continuing a long history of white politicians using black athletes to goose their bases and advance racist political causes. And the president continues to find his own safe spaces for his own counterprotests. Earlier in January, it was college football’s national championship game. Tuesday, it was the State of the Union address. They are places where no one can challenge him, where he is free to wield the anthem, the troops, or a 12-year-old boy like a club against the black voices that would dare speak out against him."

The memo reportedly alleges that the Justice Department and the FBI abused the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to spy on Carter Page, who was associated with the Trump campaign, ahead of the 2016 election.Actual FISA experts have treated that claim with extreme skepticism.President Donald Trump has indicated he supports the memo being made public, telling a House Republican after the State of the Union address that he would “100 percent” release it. Trump’s statement was at odds with the position of his own White House, which had insisted an actual review process was in place. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) on Tuesday urged his colleagues not to use the memo to undermine the Mueller probe, calling it “a completely separate matter.” His statement was a bit late ― Republicans and Fox News anchors had been using the mysterious memo to suggest it was time to fire Mueller or Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who has oversight of the special counsel investigation.Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the chair of the House Intelligence Committee and the man chiefly responsible for the memo, issued a statement on Wednesday saying DOJ and the FBI “stonewalled” Congress for nearly a year and that they issued “spurious objections to allowing the American people to see information related to surveillance abuses.”“The FBI is intimately familiar with ‘material omissions’ with respect to their presentations to both Congress and the courts, and they are welcome to make public, to the greatest extent possible, all the information they have on these abuses,” said Nunes, a member of Trump’s transition team. “Regardless, it’s clear that top officials used unverified information in a court document to fuel a counter-intelligence investigation during an American political campaign. Once the truth gets out, we can begin taking steps to ensure our intelligence agencies and courts are never misused like this again.”Asked if the Justice Department backed the FBI’s position, a department spokesperson noted that the FBI is part of DOJ, and did not immediately respond to a follow-up question. A spokesperson for Mueller’s office declined to comment.Republican attacks on the FBI appear to have had a detrimental impact on the public’s trust in the bureau. The percentage of Republicans who said they had at least a fair amount of trust in the FBI dropped 22 points from 2015 to 2018, according to a recent HuffPost/YouGov poll. The percentage of independents who had at least a fair amount of trust dropped 15 points over that timeframe, while Democrats’ trust of the bureau remained roughly level.Here’s the FBI’s full statement:The FBI takes seriously its obligations to the FISA Court and its compliance with procedures overseen by career professionals in the Department of Justice and the FBI. We are committed to working with the appropriate oversight entities to ensure the continuing integrity of the FISA process.This article has been updated with comment from Nunes, a response from Mueller’s office, and information from the HuffPost/YouGov poll.

53,POLITICS,Hundreds To Protest Potential Safety Net Cuts At GOP Retreat,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/protest-safety-net-west-virginia-gop-retreat_us_5a7232eee4b09a544b562b34,Activists want to put a human face on public assistance.,2018-01-31,House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has long supported scaling back the U.S. welfare state.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a7233fe160000450013962d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Hundreds of activists plan to converge on congressional Republicans’ winter retreat in West Virginia to protest potential cuts to the social safety net, including a recent Trump administration policy allowing states to enact Medicaid work requirements.The protest march, which will culminate at The Greenbrier, a hotel in White Sulphur Springs, is due to include a sizable contingent of people from West Virginia who depend on means-tested assistance programs like Medicaid, food stamps and cash welfare. Buses are also slated to bring protesters to the event from nine other states, including Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Arkansas.“We’re stronger together. And right now, more than ever, we need our elected officials to be looking at how we expand the safety net, how we provide more opportunities and more stability to communities across the country, not less,” said Jennifer Epps-Addison, a co-executive director of the Center for Popular Democracy Action, a progressive umbrella group organizing the event with the help of local partners.Since the overwhelming majority of West Virginians are white, the planned demonstration at The Greenbrier provides an opportunity to dispel the racist misnomer that the safety net is somehow designed to benefit people of color, according to Epps-Addison. The action will also be directed at mobilizing West Virginians, two-thirds of whom voted for President Donald Trump, Epps-Addison noted, and who may not be aware of the threat his policies could pose to their living standards.Trump and congressional Republicans play up alleged over-dependence on the safety net “as a dog whistle to get people like the folks in West Virginia to support an agenda that is going to harm them more than anyone else,” she said. “We’re not gonna let them try to brainwash or confuse the white working class without standing up and having a say and helping people understand how these policies impact them.”CPD Action, which played a key role in mass acts of civil disobedience against the Republican tax bill, is concerned that GOP leaders are gearing up to pay for the $1.4 trillion their tax cuts will add to the debt with massive cuts to social programs.House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said in December that reforming “health care entitlements” ― Medicaid and Medicare ― are a top priority. Later that month, in an apparent reference to safety-net programs like food stamps, Ryan declared, “Welfare reform is our next big lift.” A more immediate worry for progressive groups is the Trump administration’s policy of allowing states to experiment with work requirements for their Medicaid programs.Liberal policy experts see the restrictions as a punitive policy that is likely to cause vulnerable people needless suffering by depriving them of essential health care.The vast majority of non-elderly, adult Medicaid beneficiaries already work or are members of households that work, according to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. Those who do not work are frequently ill or disabled, caring for a loved one, or report being unable to find a job, KFF found.In addition, there is ample evidence that ensuring easier access to health care makes people more, not less, likely to seek work opportunities.West Virginia activists like Sammi Brown, federal campaign director for the West Virginia Healthy Kids and Families Coalition, are already fighting a state-level proposal to add work requirements to Medicaid.“We know that if you did not have to [seek help], you wouldn’t,” Brown said. “We don’t want to add to that feeling of distress when you are trying to make ends meet.”If Congress were to impose additional budget cuts and restrictions on federal funding for social programs, it would hit West Virginia particularly hard. The state has the fourth-highest percentage of people on food stamps, and the seventh-highest rate of Medicaid enrollment, with about 30 percent of residents receiving coverage from the program.Courtney Powell, a 29-year-old single mother of three living in Wheeling, depends on Medicaid to finance medical coverage for her 4-year-old son who has a rare form of hemophilia.Powell has foregone work to care for her son, who needs round-the-clock attention and is frequently hospitalized. Federal disability benefits for his condition allow Powell to make ends meet.“If he didn’t have this diagnosis and they could take it away, there’d be nothing I wouldn’t do for him,” Powell said, imagining the opportunity to put in an 80-hour week. “But right now, the ‘nothing I wouldn’t do’ is being there for him and doing his meds daily and being his advocate for all of his medical problems.”Now, Powell is worried that as an adult who is technically able-bodied, she could be targeted by Medicaid cuts. She hopes to make it to the protest tomorrow“The most important thing is that … they get real stories and they know who is truly, truly being hurt,” she said, choking back tears. “It is not just about the numbers.”CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated Courtney Powell’s first name as Amy."

The island’s 3.4 million residents went days with little water, food, power or gas as acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke described relief efforts as “a good news story.” When supplies finally arrived, they got clogged up at ports and weren’t distributed around the island. Hundreds of thousands of Americans went months without adequate drinking water or power. More than 1,000 people may have died.Trump visited San Juan in October. He threw rolls of paper towels at hurricane victims gathered at a disaster relief center and told reporters his team was doing “a great job.”As of Tuesday, at least half a million Americans still don’t have power, per official government numbers, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency just announced it is ending its food and water shipments to Puerto Rico. Island officials appeared blindsided by the news.Trump mentioned none of this in his national address. Lawmakers who have been urging more attention on Puerto Rico’s recovery were furious.“I was hoping for some sort of apology on Puerto Rico, but I heard nothing,” said Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.). “Puerto Rico is a metaphor for how this president sees all Latinos and people of color: He does not see us as his equals, and he does not see us as fellow human beings.”He added, “If you look at how the president has treated Puerto Rico, you have to conclude that he just doesn’t care and probably thinks of Puerto Rico as just another shithole country.”San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz, who attended the State of the Union address, said afterward that Puerto Rico is not even on “the Republican radar.”While parts of Puerto Rico have stabilized, there are towns in rural areas still struggling to maintain a steady supply of food and water."

Yet he made no mention of the planetary warming ― 2017 was the second-hottest year on record ― that worsened the disasters, instead bolstering his administration’s aggressive fossil fuel push. “We endured floods and fires and storms,” Trump said. “But through it all, we have seen the beauty of America’s soul, and the steel in America’s spine.” The White House made slashing environmental regulations a cornerstone of its agenda over the past year, going as far as to purge government websites of climate data and remove issues like sea-level rise from the administration’s list of security threats. The deregulatory assault came as Trump aggressively aimed to increase fossil fuel production and use.The speech put a glossy finish on the president’s so-called “energy dominance” agenda, as the United States is poised this year to surpass Saudi Arabia and Russia as the largest oil producer.“We have ended the war on American energy,” he said. “We are now very proudly an exporter of energy to the world”In reality, the U.S. remains a steady importer of crude oil, and likely won’t become a net exporter of energy until the 2020s, according to a forecast this month by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Exports, driven by the boom in shale oil brought on by the rise of hydraulic fracturing, surged under former President Barack Obama. “The thing about the U.S. energy picture is as of late it’s very much a success story, but that’s a story that obviously began well before Mr. Trump became president,” Ethan Zindler, a Washington, D.C.-based analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said before the speech. “But it also continued last year.” Trump also boasted during the address that coal made a comeback under his administration. “We have ended the war on American Energy and we have ended the war on beautiful, clean coal,” he said. But the revival fell flat compared to his promises. Coal production and exports increased slightly, but coal-fired plant closures continued apace. Trump has repeatedly portrayed himself as the coal industry’s savior, but the federal agency that controls energy infrastructure rejected the administration’s only plan to subsidize coal plants earlier this month. The Washington Post this month debunked the president’s claims about helping coal miners and stoking demand for fuel, and gave the president three and four “Pinocchios” for his statements on those topics, indicating that they were highly inaccurate. “Clean coal,” meanwhile, remains an oxymoronic myth as experimental projects to capture and contain carbon dioxide emissions at coal-burning plants continue to fail or prove too expensive. Along with boosting America’s production of fossil fuels, Trump vowed — as he has before — to rebuild America’s crumbling roads, airports and bridges. But he offered few details about how he plans to pay for it.“I am asking both parties to come together to give us the safe, fast, reliable, and modern infrastructure our economy needs and our people deserve,” Trump said. Trump is expected to proposed infrastructure plans that could make it easier to obtain building permits. The fossil fuel industry ― especially pipeline builders ― could gain the most from the potential change, but renewable energy producers could also benefit. “That may not please environmentalists, but it’s important not to necessarily conflate the clean-energy industry with the environmental community,” Zindler said before the speech.“It’s so backward,” John O’Grady, president of American Federation of Government Employees Council 238, which represents more than 8,000 people who work at the Environmental Protection Agency, told HuffPost ahead of the speech. “They’re trying to use 1970 as the starting point and work their way backward.”A leaked White House document, which Politico and Axios obtained last week, suggested the government would look to sell off, trade or transfer federal assets, including land, to help pay for infrastructure projects. It also outlined the administration’s plans to use mineral and energy revenues to pay for such improvements. Paul Teller, a special assistant to the president for legislative affairs, told Politico the memo does not reflect the final proposal.A spokeswoman for Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke also dismissed reports that public land is on the table. “The Secretary’s position is unchanged,” she told the Missoulian. Both Zinke and Trump have repeatedly said they oppose selling off or transferring control of federal lands.Adding to environmentalists’ worries, The Washington Post reported Friday on a second leaked draft document suggesting the White House aims to scale back environmental requirements to simplify and fast-track its infrastructure efforts. The plan would require government agencies to adhere to strict environmental review deadlines and limit certain agencies’ abilities to prevent projects from moving forward.In a call with reporters ahead of Trump’s speech, representatives from several environmental groups slammed the White House proposal.“It’s a scam that will gut or significantly change at least 10 bedrock environmental laws to make it easier for corporations to bypass critical protections for air, water and wildlife,” said Christy Goldfuss, senior vice president for energy and environment policy at the Center for American Progress."

Exports, driven by the boom in shale oil brought on by the rise of hydraulic fracturing, surged under former President Barack Obama. “The thing about the U.S. energy picture is as of late it’s very much a success story, but that’s a story that obviously began well before Mr. Trump became president,” Ethan Zindler, a Washington, D.C.-based analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said before the speech. “But it also continued last year.” Trump also boasted during the address that coal made a comeback under his administration. “We have ended the war on American Energy and we have ended the war on beautiful, clean coal,” he said. But the revival fell flat compared to his promises. Coal production and exports increased slightly, but coal-fired plant closures continued apace. Trump has repeatedly portrayed himself as the coal industry’s savior, but the federal agency that controls energy infrastructure rejected the administration’s only plan to subsidize coal plants earlier this month. The Washington Post this month debunked the president’s claims about helping coal miners and stoking demand for fuel, and gave the president three and four “Pinocchios” for his statements on those topics, indicating that they were highly inaccurate. “Clean coal,” meanwhile, remains an oxymoronic myth as experimental projects to capture and contain carbon dioxide emissions at coal-burning plants continue to fail or prove too expensive. Along with boosting America’s production of fossil fuels, Trump vowed — as he has before — to rebuild America’s crumbling roads, airports and bridges. But he offered few details about how he plans to pay for it.“I am asking both parties to come together to give us the safe, fast, reliable, and modern infrastructure our economy needs and our people deserve,” Trump said. Trump is expected to proposed infrastructure plans that could make it easier to obtain building permits. The fossil fuel industry ― especially pipeline builders ― could gain the most from the potential change, but renewable energy producers could also benefit. “That may not please environmentalists, but it’s important not to necessarily conflate the clean-energy industry with the environmental community,” Zindler said before the speech.“It’s so backward,” John O’Grady, president of American Federation of Government Employees Council 238, which represents more than 8,000 people who work at the Environmental Protection Agency, told HuffPost ahead of the speech. “They’re trying to use 1970 as the starting point and work their way backward.”A leaked White House document, which Politico and Axios obtained last week, suggested the government would look to sell off, trade or transfer federal assets, including land, to help pay for infrastructure projects. It also outlined the administration’s plans to use mineral and energy revenues to pay for such improvements. Paul Teller, a special assistant to the president for legislative affairs, told Politico the memo does not reflect the final proposal.A spokeswoman for Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke also dismissed reports that public land is on the table. “The Secretary’s position is unchanged,” she told the Missoulian.

Trump’s executive order will cement the existence of a detention facility that has fueled international disagreements in the 16 years it has been open. The White House announced the move ahead the president’s State of the Union address on Tuesday. The announcement came as the government revealed in court filings its intent to “demolish” part of the detention facility to clear the way for future renovations. “I just signed an order directing Secretary [Jim] Mattis to re-examine our military detention policy and to keep open the detention facilities at Guantanamo Bay,” Trump said during his address to Congress.Trump, shortly after winning the 2016 election, said he’d keep the controversial facility open and “load it up with some bad dudes.” Trump has yet to send any prisoners to the detention center, but he said in November that he’d “certainly consider” sending the suspect of an Oct. 31 New York City terror attack to the facility.But his campaign promises have smacked into reality: Guantanamo is really bad at convicting alleged terrorists. The federal court system regularly convicts terror suspects, but the military commissions system is deeply troubled. The trial against the alleged perpetrators of the Sept. 11 attack has dragged on for years, and there’s not even a firm start date. “Would love to send the NYC terrorist to Guantanamo,” Trump tweeted in early November, “but statistically that process takes much longer than going through the Federal system.”“The notion that Guantanamo is worthwhile would be laughable if it wasn’t so tragic,” Hina Shamsi, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s National Security Project, said in a statement. “In addition to the incalculable human suffering, it costs taxpayers more than $445 million a year to detain the 41 men now there. Congress should prevent President Trump from continuing unlawful detention and unconstitutional military commissions. And we all must pledge — not one person more in Guantanamo, not in our names.”Trump’s move is more of a political statement than a practical change. President Barack Obama’s 2009 executive order to close the prison, which he warned was a recruiting ground for terrorist groups at the expense of taxpayers, faced strong opposition in Congress that prevented him from transferring detainees to the United States. The Obama administration managed to transfer nearly 200 inmates from the facility. There are just 41 inmates at Guantanamo today. Obama, in his final days in office, said that “history will cast a harsh judgement” on the United States for not closing Guantanamo, and said Republicans had “placed politics above the ongoing costs to taxpayers, our relationships with our allies, and the threat posed to U.S. national security by leaving open a facility that governments around the world condemn and which hinders rather than helps our fight against terrorism.” Attorneys for Guantanamo detainees are now trying to use a Trump tweet stating that “there should be no further releases” from Guantanamo as a way to challenge their clients’ ongoing detention. This post has been updated with more details about the order, background on Guantanamo Bay and a statement from Hina Shamsi."

In total, his office will be reviewing, recalling and resentencing up to 4,940 felony marijuana convictions, as well as dismissing and sealing 3,038 misdemeanor cases that were sentenced prior to the ballot measure’s passage. The process could end up helping thousands of people whose lives have been disrupted or derailed over activities that became legal as of Jan. 1. Criminal convictions can have devastating consequences long after the offense was committed, making it difficult to obtain employment, bank loans and housing.Voters approved Proposition 64 in 2016 to legalize marijuana for recreational purposes and reduce criminal penalties for various marijuana-related offenses for adults and juveniles. But the law did more than legalize marijuana, it also authorized a new process for individuals in the state to get previous marijuana-related convictions retroactively reduced, reclassified as lesser offenses or cleared altogether."

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), an independent who caucuses with Democrats, did not mince words in a policy-laden speech responding to President Donald Trump.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a7157ea1d000026006ad49e.jpeg?cache=zuAZOvXAbl&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In a speech indicting President Donald Trump’s vision and policies on Tuesday night, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) lauded an upswell of progressive activism, dubbing it “the beginning of a political revolution.”Rep. Joseph Kennedy III (D-Mass.) had the honor of delivering the Democratic Party’s official response to Trump’ State of the Union address; Virginia Del. Elizabeth Guzman (D) offered the official Spanish-language response.But, in a reflection of the diverse chorus of Democratic voices eager to make their mark, several other progressive leaders, including Sanders, joined the fray.Acting as a de facto spokesman for the left wing of the Democratic Party and the motley mix of disenchanted populists who flocked to his 2016 presidential campaign, Sanders’ speech was, true to brand, far more radical in its proposals, indignant in its tone and saturated with policy details than the two official responses delivered by Kennedy and Guzman. Streamed live online, it was also nearly twice as long as either of their orations ― and, unlike his Democratic counterparts, Sanders chose not to refer to God in his closing.He divided his comments into three parts: a description of the campaign promises Trump has failed to uphold; the “major crises facing our country that, regrettably, President Trump chose not to discuss;” and a discussion of Sanders’ own ambitious progressive vision for the country.Sanders argued that while Trump claims to be helping American workers, the overwhelming share of income gains in the economy continue to go to the richest slice of the country.“Since March of last year, the three richest people in America saw their wealth increase by more than $68 billion. Three people,” he declared incredulously. “A $68 billion increase in wealth. Meanwhile, the average worker saw an increase of 4 cents an hour.”Exposing Trump as a false populist is a favorite pastime for Sanders, whom observers sometimes lump together with Trump as a figure who channeled the anti-establishment zeitgeist in the 2016 election. Sanders’ message was that Trump’s everyman schtick on the campaign trail has turned out to be a fraud. Among other disparities between his campaign promises and governance, Sanders took Trump to task for claiming he would bring down prescription drug prices before appointing a former pharmaceutical executive, Alex Azar, to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. As a candidate, Trump also made noise about taking on the titans of Wall Street, Sanders noted. Not so once in office, the Vermont senator said.“As president, not only has Trump not taken on Wall Street, he has appointed more Wall Street billionaires to his administration than any president in history,” Sanders stated. “And now, on behalf of Wall Street, he is trying to repeal the modest provisions of the Dodd-Frank legislation, which provide consumer protections against Wall Street thievery.”Equally offensive to Sanders was Trump’s omission of climate change and other pressing topics from his State of the Union address. (Democrats also left it out of their two official responses.)“No, Mr. Trump, climate change is not a ‘hoax,’” Sanders said. “It is a reality which is causing devastating harm all over our country and all over the world, and you are dead wrong when you appoint administrators at the EPA and other agencies who are trying to decimate environmental protection rules and slow down the transition to sustainable energy.”Like other Democrats, Sanders spoke passionately about the need to stand up to Trump’s attempts to “divide us up based on the color of our skin, our nation of origin, our religion, our gender, or our sexual orientation.” He also expounded on the need to allow the Dreamers, or undocumented immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children, to stay in the country.But the social-democratic agenda that Sanders advocated in his speech went far beyond that. His vision for the country is one in which all residents have access to an expanded Medicare program, workers earn at least $15 an hour, families have access to paid child care and students can attend public college for free.Concluding on a positive note, Sanders said he saw, in the anti-Trump activism on display during the Women’s March the day after Trump’s inauguration, a grassroots movement to not only take on the president, but enact the comprehensive progressive agenda Sanders advocates.“We are starting to see the beginning of a political revolution, something long overdue,” he said. “And these candidates, from coast to coast, are standing tall for a progressive agenda, an agenda that works for the working families of our country and not just the billionaire class.“These candidates understand that the United States has got to join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee health care to all as a right, not a privilege, through a Medicare for all, single-payer program,” he continued.Of course, the truth is a bit more complicated. The masses of Democratic voters who have taken to the streets, as well as new candidates running for office, include a fair number of mainstream liberals and even moderates. And Democratic Party leaders have remained adept at keeping left-wing mavericks away from the levers of power.But Sanders’ populist agenda has picked up momentum ― and had some successes at the ballot box.In fact, one dyed-in-the-wool progressive who backed Sanders’ 2016 presidential bid is Guzman, the Virginia state lawmaker chosen to deliver the official Democratic State of the Union response in Spanish.In an interview with HuffPost, Guzman recalled Sanders’ virtual town hall speech to convention delegates after conceding the Democratic nomination to Hillary Clinton.“He said if we really believe in his message about the working class ... policies and laws are taking place at the state and local level. And if we really wanted to create change, then we needed to run for office,” Guzman said. And so she did."

Joseph Kennedy III (D-Mass.) denounced the Trump administration’s policies for “turning American life into a zero-sum game” in which the well-being of some Americans must come at the expense of others.Speaking to an audience in the auto body shop of a vocational high school in Fall River, Massachusetts, the third-term congressman described the proposition Trump has offered the country as one in which “we can guarantee America’s safety if we slash our safety net” and “we can take care of sick kids if we sacrifice Dreamers.”“As if the mechanic in Pittsburgh and the teacher in Tulsa and the day-care worker in Birmingham are somehow bitter rivals rather than mutual casualties of a system forcefully rigged for those at the top,” Kennedy said.Democrats offer a more inclusive vision in which one ordinary American’s fortunes do not need to fall in order to make another’s rise, he declared.“We choose both. We fight for both,” Kennedy said. “Because the strongest, richest, greatest nation in the world shouldn’t leave anyone behind.”Democratic policies that exemplify those values, according to Kennedy, include a “living wage, paid leave and affordable child care”; a health care system that “offers mercy”; and an “economy strong enough to boast record stock prices and brave enough to admit that top CEOs making 300 times the average worker is not right.”Switching briefly to Spanish, Kennedy addressed Dreamers, as undocumented immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children are commonly known.“You are part of our history. We are going to fight for you, and we are not going away,” he said.For the millions of Americans whose primary language is Spanish, however, the Democratic Party offered a separate response. Virginia Del. Elizabeth Guzman, a new progressive state lawmaker and immigrant from Peru, delivered a Spanish-language response at the same time as Kennedy on Spanish-language television.Kennedy, a 37-year-old former prosecutor and grandson of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy (D-N.Y.), who was assassinated in 1968, is frequently discussed as one of the party’s rising stars. He drew particular acclaim for passionate speeches denouncing Republican policies, including an indignant response to the claim by House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) that repealing the Affordable Care Act was “an act of mercy.”In selecting Kennedy to deliver the speech, Democratic congressional leaders tapped someone with mainstream liberal credentials who has stopped short of the most ambitious progressive positions and economic populist rhetoric. Kennedy has not signed on to single-payer health care legislation that has the support of a majority of the House Democratic Caucus, and he opposes the legalization of marijuana.Kennedy’s speech reflected the Democratic Party’s effort to at once capitalize on Trump’s unpopularity and focus on pocketbook issues that it believes will appeal to a broad array of voters.By attacking Trump for pitting American workers against one another, Kennedy managed to present a progressive economic message that Democrats might deliver under any Republican president.Still, he made sure to channel the shock of liberals who believe that Trump is a break from American traditions of civility that has given comfort to white supremacists and other extreme groups.Listing especially upsetting developments during Trump’s tenure, Kennedy was sure to include “hatred and supremacy proudly marching in our streets” ― a reference to the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that Trump refused to condemn unequivocally.Many Americans, he concluded, have “that nagging, sinking feeling, no matter your political beliefs: This is not right. This is not who we are.”"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a702af22d00001f00943247.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Weeks of confusion and inconsistencies from immigration officials ended on Monday after authorities deported a Palestinian man who had been living in the U.S. for nearly 40 years.Immigration and Customs Enforcement had kept Amer Othman Adi, 57, in detention for two weeks, ignoring a House Judiciary Committee request that the Department of Homeland Security review his case, which would have allowed him to temporarily remain in the U.S.“In a highly irregular rebuke of Congressional authority by ICE, Amer Othman was ripped from his four daughters, his wife, and the country that he has called home for over thirty years,” Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), who had been fighting his deportation, said in a statement. “Amer was a pillar of the community and brought commerce to a downtown that craved investment. He hired members of our community. He paid taxes. He did everything right. There are violent criminals walking the streets, yet our government wasted our precious resources incarcerating him.”Othman Adi, who arrived in the U.S. 39 years ago and whose wife and three daughters are all U.S. citizens, had his green card revoked after authorities accused him of marriage fraud. He was never granted a day in court to fight the charge, despite his ex-wife signing an affidavit confirming that the marriage was indeed legitimate and claiming that authorities had pressured her to previously say the marriage had been fake. He and his current wife, Fidaa Musleh, have been fighting the charge for years without success.Facing a deport order since 2009, he was spared under President Barack Obama’s administration, thanks to a “private bill” passed in the House of Representatives.President Donald Trump did away with that provision, and in September, Othman Adi attended what he thought was a regular ICE check-in meeting. Instead, agents placed an ankle bracelet on him and told him he had until Jan. 7 to exit the country. He and his wife sold their house in Youngstown, Ohio, and purchased plane tickets to Amman, Jordan ― where he is a citizen. Early this year, he was told that the deportation had been called off.When he showed up for another routine ICE meeting on Jan. 16, he was detained with zero explanation and placed in jail.On Jan. 18, the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security voted to request that DHS review Othman Adi’s case, which would have placed a six-month stay on his deportation. ICE ignored the request.“They didn’t comply, they didn’t release him,” one of his daughters, Haneen Adi, told HuffPost last week. “They denied him a stay and now they are just keeping him in prison and not saying when they will let him out.”Othman Adi’s wife grew increasingly concerned when, on Monday morning, she didn’t receive her daily call from him, she told WKBN. Later that night, around 8 p.m., the family said they finally learned he had been moved from Youngstown to Chicago, where he was awaiting a flight to Amman. Just three hours later and after only a quick goodbye, he left.Othman Adi’s case is one of several recent key moments for Trump’s hard-line immigration policies, where Americans are seeing not just violent criminals deported, but valued members of their communities as well. “His story is in so many ways what Youngstown stands for,” Mayor Tito Brown told WOSU of Adi, a successful small business owner. “He’s what Youngstown needs more of.”Youngstown residents have come out in droves to support Adi, organizing vigils and protests. Former congressman and presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich even joined the demonstrations.“I hope President Trump comes to realize that when his words become public policy in places like Youngstown, families like Amer’s are ripped apart,” Ryan said. “I’m sad that America, and the American Presidency has become a place where politics outweighs doing what is right.”Clarification: Language in this story has been amended to better explain the request to DHS from the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security."
67,POLITICS,Here's The 'Urgent Wish List' Trophy Hunters Sent To Ryan Zinke,Chris D'Angelo,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trophy-hunting-groups-wish-list-ryan-zinke_us_5a6f91fbe4b0a52682feaa55,The administration seemed to be moving forward with the requests — until Donald Trump surprised everyone by stepping in.,2018-01-30,"Bull African elephants sparring at South Luangwa National Park, Zambia.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0f87ab1400004a0050e20c.jpeg?cache=Y7MGMSs3rs&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — Most trophy hunters consider displaying the head, hide or tusks of a kill just as important as bagging the big one. And advocates of this controversial sport wasted little time asking Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to change some policies that would ensure hunters could bring exotic wildlife killed in other countries into the United States.In a July letter, which HuffPost obtained last week as part of a Freedom of Information Act request, eight trophy hunting organizations urged Zinke ― who talks often about the hunting community’s contributions to conservation and was quick to outfit his office with taxidermied creatures ― to take swift action to right the perceived wrongs of the previous administration. Conservation Force, a trophy hunting advocacy group based in Louisiana, spearheaded the July letter. In it, the nonprofit’s president, John J. Jackson III, and executives at several safari clubs and sport hunting advocacy groups called on Zinke to walk back several Obama-era regulations. First, they asked the interior secretary to roll back a pair regulations that prevented U.S. hunters from importing the trophies of lions and elephants killed for sport in certain African countries. The organizations also petitioned the new administration to reform how the Endangered Species Act is applied to species outside the U.S., and to reject a petition calling on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to list all African leopards as endangered under the ESA and restrict hunters from importing their parts. They also called for Zinke to revise seizure and forfeiture practices that they say “discourage lawful tourist hunting.”The letter writers noted the groups’ members annually “contribute tens of millions of dollars to the conservation of wildlife and protection of habitat across the globe.” They warn that failing to implement the recommendations could hurt African economies, incentivize poaching and threaten the survival of iconic species.“This is not an ideological issue to us,” Jackson told HuffPost. “It’s traditional conservation practices.”He called the letter to Zinke an “emergency request” and “an urgent wish list.”A little more than three months after the letter landed on Zinke’s desk, FWS started fulfilling that wish list — be it strategic or by coincidence. FWS quietly began issuing trophy import permits for lions hunted in Zimbabwe and Zambia. And a few weeks after that, in mid-November, the administration lifted a 2014 ban on importing elephant trophies from those African countries. It determined that sport hunting of elephants there would “enhance the survival of the species in the wild,” a spokesperson for the FWS said at the time.The decision sparked widespread public outrage, including from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.But then President Donald Trump tweeted that he was putting elephant trophy imports on hold ― reversing his own administration’s decision less than 15 minutes after FWS released an official announcement. He called trophy hunting a “horror show” and said he was unlikely to allow for such imports.More than two months later, neither the administration nor the Interior Department has made an official announcement. But in an interview with Piers Morgan that aired Sunday, Trump indicated that the ban on importing elephant trophies will remain in place. Jackson is among those who argues that expensive safari hunting is crucial to the conservation of big game species. He says the Obama administration failed to protect African species, interrupting the flow of money that groups in Africa use to fight poaching and protect habitat.“If these elephants’ survival is dependent upon that revenue — those incentives to the government, to the local people — then any delay is detrimental,” he said. “We’re talking about hurting the species.”Jackson said the Trump administration has not lived up to his expectations. “We’re disappointed in the progress that’s been made so far,” he said. “Part of it is because of the president’s hold on the progress that had been made [by Fish and Wildlife].”That Trump would side with the conservation community over gun rights and hunting advocacy groups is surprising. His sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump are avid big game hunters. In a photo that surfaced in 2012, Trump Jr. can be seen holding the tail of an elephant he shot and killed in Africa.Jackson isn’t alone in his frustration. A day after Trump suspended his administration’s decision to allow elephant imports, the Safari Club sent out a “call to arms,” in which the group encouraged hunters to complain to Trump and Zinke and blasted “hysterical anti-hunters and news media outlets.”Conservationists and animal rights advocates applauded Trump for stepping in. “This is the kind of trade we don’t need,” Wayne Pacelle, CEO of The Humane Society of the United States, tweeted in November. The Center for Biological Diversity and the Natural Resources Defense Council filed a lawsuit against the administration Nov. 20, seeking to clear up any confusion about where things stood and to block the Trump team’s effort to roll back the bans on importing elephants and lions. The government’s actions are “arbitrary and capricious,” the conservation groups wrote in their complaint.African elephants have been listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act since 1978. African lions were listed in 2015. A provision of the law, which is intended to safeguard threatened species and the habitats critical to their survival, allows for sport-hunted trophies to be imported if the government determines that hunting will help safeguard the population. The FWS concluded that Zimbabwe, for example, had made strides to improve elephant management and anti-poaching efforts, according to a notice published in the Federal Register.The decision on elephant trophies has raised questions about Zinke’s close relationship with the sport hunting community, in particular the Safari Club. The organization’s political action committees donated a collective $24,500 to Trump’s presidential campaign and Zinke’s 2014 and 2016 congressional bids, according to Federal Election Commission data.Greg Sheehan, principal deputy director of the FWS — who broke the news about the elephant decision to the Safari Club during the African Wildlife Consultative Forum in Tanzania — is a member of the hunting organization.“It would seem that Zinke is letting Safari Club set Interior’s agenda on wildlife just like other industry representatives are setting the rest of Interior’s work, which is a travesty for wildlife and wild places,” Tanya Sanerib, the international program legal director at the Center for Biological Diversity, told HuffPost via email. The Trump administration has not yet moved to fulfill any other demands from the sport hunting groups. But in his time at Interior, Zinke has worked to promote and increase opportunities for hunting and fishing. He installed a “Big Buck Hunter” arcade game in the cafeteria of Interior Department headquarters, which he said would highlight the contributions that hunting and fishing communities make to conservation. And in November he announced the creation of a so-called International Wildlife Conservation Council to advise him on “the benefits that international recreational hunting has on foreign wildlife and habitat conservation, anti-poaching and illegal wildlife trafficking programs.” Jackson told HuffPost he is among department’s nominees to serve on the council.During his interview with Morgan, Trump said “a very high-level government person” was responsible for the “terrible” decision to lift the Obama-era ban, but he didn’t specify who that was. “I totally turned it around,” he boasted. Neither the White House nor the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service responded to HuffPost’s request for comment on which high-ranking official made the decision and on whether Trump is planning to keep the trophy import bans in place.Read the full July 4 letter below. Along with Conservation Force, it was signed by representatives of the Dallas Safari Club, Dallas Safari Club Foundation, Houston Safari Club, African Safari Club, Wild Sheep Foundation, Grand Slam Club/Ovis and Chancellor International Wildlife Fund, Inc."

They were participating in city’s first Gender and Sexuality Alliance summit, sponsored by the local Department of Education.In the school’s auditorium, student whispers echoed from wall to wall. On stage, openly gay former professional football player Wade Davis told how he spent years as a closeted athlete, before eventually coming to terms with his sexual identity.“When did you learn you were enough for yourself?” a teenager timidly stood up to ask him.“Honestly, I’m still learning if I’m being honest,” Davis responded. It’s been a bleak year for LBGTQ youth around the country. Hate crimes against LGBTQ people have creeped upwards. The Trump administration has worked to actively dismantle the rights of trans students. But in New York, the education department has been working to help LGBTQ students better advocate for themselves.The summit was organized by the city school district’s first LGBTQ community liaison, Jared Fox. It featured dozens of workshops on topics such as interacting with police, body image, grassroots organizing, and consent in sexual encounters. Classrooms were labeled with names of LBGTQ icons, like author James Baldwin and tennis star Billie Jean King. A school hang out spot became a coffee shop named for feminist writer and civil rights activist Audre Lorde. In a workshop hosted by LGBT New York Police Department officers, teens asked officers about their experiences being gay in the force.“There’s a stereotype of what are you doing here, this is not the place for you,” said officer Aaron Ayala, before telling the students about the department’s internal fraternal societies.“Ours is an adult GSA,” Ayala said.The day’s participants included middle school students. They did not have the day off from classes, so they attended as a field trip.The afternoon’s events topped off with a drag queen story hour, dance party, and appearance by New York’s first lady, Chirlane McCray. “The number of young people who felt inspired and adults who never could have imagined something like this happening in their lifetimes was amazing,” Fox said.

But besides sending spacecraft into the sky, preparing for the release of the Tesla Semi electric truck and all the other things a genius billionaire businessman does in his day-to-day life, Musk has also launched an actual functional flamethrower for consumers, and he claims he has already sold 10,000 of the $500 weapons.One of Musk’s newest endeavor is The Boring Co., which aims to quickly dig tunnels while “dropping costs by a factor of 10 or more,” according to its website. Tunnels might sound, well, boring, but the company is linked to Musk’s vision for a rapid-transit Hyperloop system that would use tunnels.So far, however, The Boring Co. hasn’t been digging as much as it’s been joking. In late 2017, Musk started selling branded caps through the company’s website, raising $1 million from the sale of 50,000 hats. At the time, he made what was thought to be a joke; now it appears to be very real.And so it has come to pass. Over the weekend, Musk tweeted about the flamethrower several times, including posting an Instagram video of himself using the gun to produce a flame about 2 feet long. The short flame length keeps it from meeting the federal definition of an illegal flamethrower, Musk claimed.“ATF [the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives] says any flamethrower with a flame shorter than 10 ft is A-ok. Our design is max fun for least danger. I’d be way more scared of a steak knife,” he tweeted.In response to a question posed to them online, the Australian Federal Police advised potential buyers to “check with your local police for local laws.” But it’s nothing but enthusiasm on the Boring Co. site: “World’s safest flamethrower!” the product description reads.“Before shipping, aspiring flamethrower aficionados will be sent a terms and conditions rhyme for review and acceptance. Starts shipping in spring.”In more tongue-in-cheek descriptions, the company advises the flamethrower “may not be used on Boring Company decorative lacquered hay bales or Boring Company dockside munitions warehouses” and “fire extinguisher sold separately (for exorbitant amounts of money).”A $30 “overpriced” fire extinguisher is also available on the website. After tweeting about hitting the 10,000 flamethrower sales mark, Musk added that only 3,000 of its fire extinguishers had been ordered.“You can definitely buy one for less elsewhere, but this one comes with a cool sticker,” the website said.A Californian lawmaker isn’t amused, though. He’s criticized Musk’s incendiary new product and has vowed to push for it to be made illegal in the state. California Assemblyman Miguel Santiago (D-Los Angeles) cited law enforcement and public safety issues.“We don’t allow people to walk in off the street and purchase military-grade tanks or armor-piercing ammunition. I cannot even begin to image the problems a flamethrower would cause firefighters and police officers alike,” he said in a statement tweeted by a Los Angeles Times reporter Monday."

Mark Ruffalo, Michael Moore, Common, Amy Schumer, Rosie Perez and others either performed or spoke at the New York City event. Snippets of Leguizamo’s speech were shared by BuzzFeed’s Andrew Kimmel via Twitter. The actor spoke about immigrant rights ― calling America “the best country ever stolen” ― and breaking down why everyone needs to vote in this year’s midterm elections. “As Americans, we are not free unless we are all free and equal,” Leguizamo said. “And until we are all equal ― Latinos, African Americans, Native Americans, Muslims, Jews, Asians, women, LGBTQ ― then we are not truly free. We are still the wretched refuse, we are still the tired, the poor and we yearn to be free. That is the promise of America. That is why we all came to this great country.” Leguizamo then took on Trump, referencing his presidential campaign slogan. “Make America great again, really great ― not just for the white and the wealthy and the male and for a stupid slogan on a hat,” he said. “But for all of us.”Women’s March organizer Paola Mendoza also touched on immigrant rights in her time at the podium. The Latina activist reminded the audience about the president’s hateful rhetoric toward immigrants during his presidential campaign.“This president won the election by hating us,” said Mendoza, who is a Colombian immigrant. “By hating immigrants. By vilifying the undocumented community. We have to protect our community. Our undocumented brothers and sisters can’t vote, so we must vote for them.”"

Unlike Harvey Weinstein and [former Democratic Sen.] Al Franken and others, Steve has denied them. There is an investigation that’s going to take place. He should be allowed due process. If he is found of any wrongdoing, we’ll return 100 percent of that money.”Wynn wasn’t just any donor to the Republican Party. He was the finance chairman for the RNC and part of President Donald Trump’s inaugural committee, and he has donated millions over the years (primarily to GOP candidates and committees).McDaniel insists there must be “due process” for Wynn, although the party had no problem pushing him out as finance chair ― because it did, indeed, look bad for the RNC to have him running its fundraising. But due process is evidently very important when it comes to money he’s donated to the RNC. Wynn has given roughly $1.3 million to GOP campaign committees. The RNC also aggressively went after Democrats ― particularly the Democratic National Committee ― when the Weinstein allegations came out. The RNC insisted that its Democratic counterpart return the $300,000 Weinstein donated.McDaniel said the difference between Weinstein and Wynn is that Wynn is insisting he’s innocent. It’s a distinction the party has made repeatedly, including with Trump, the man at the top of the Republican Party who has also been accused of sexual misconduct by numerous women.The RNC also decided to stand by Republican Roy Moore in Alabama’s recent special election for Senate, even though Moore was accused of pursuing ― and assaulting ― teenage girls when he was in his 30s.In other words, it appears the RNC will stand by any man as long as he denies whatever he’s accused of doing.Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), who runs the group in charge of electing Republicans to the Senate, told MSNBC on Tuesday that he doesn’t know what his National Republican Senatorial Committee will do with the $100,000 Wynn has given them.“We’ll make sure we do the appropriate action,” Gardner said.When pressed, he said he still wasn’t sure what that was.Correction: This piece originally stated that Wynn donated $1.3 million to the RNC. That number is the amount he has donated to the RNC and the House and Senate campaign committees. "

Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) contacted both the Capitol Police and Attorney General Jeff Sessions to ask them to consider checking identification of State of the Union guests and “arresting any illegal aliens in attendance,” he said on Twitter. It was a clear threat to the so-called Dreamers, young people who came to the U.S. as children, whom Democrats invited to watch President Donald Trump’s speech. State of the Union guest lists are typically used to signal lawmakers’ priorities, and Democrats invited Dreamers to show their support for granting them legal status. Gosar showed his support for having them deported. “Of all the places where the Rule of Law needs to be enforced, it should be in the hallowed halls of Congress,” he said in a statement. “Any illegal aliens attempting to go through security, under any pretext of invitation or otherwise, should be arrested and deported.” Gosar also asked police to arrest individuals who used fraudulent Social Security numbers and identification to go through security. There’s no reason to think Dreamers would have done so ― individuals with protections under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, can get legitimate Social Security numbers and driver’s licenses, not to mention other types of valid ID.Capitol Police and the Department of Justice did not immediately respond to request for comment on whether Gosar made the request or whether they planned to act on it.House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) spokeswoman AshLee Strong said that “the speaker clearly does not agree.”But by the time Gosar fired off his tweets, Dreamers were already in the building. Many of them participated in a press conference inside the Capitol complex with Democrats to call for legal status for young undocumented immigrants, who are set to lose protections and work permits because Trump rescinded DACA.They said they weren’t going to be scared off by the congressman. “We feel confident that things are going to turn out for the best, and they can try to intimidate us in any way, scare us in whatever way, but we’re not afraid,” Aldo Solano, a Dreamer attending the address as a guest of Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.), told HuffPost after the press conference. Astrid Silva, a Dreamer attending as the guest of Rep. Ruben Kihuen (D-Nev.), said Gosar’s tweets made her wonder how he acts toward undocumented immigrants in the area he represents. “If that’s what he’s doing to us who are here in the Capitol at the State of the Union, what’s he doing to people in his community? What kind of fear is he inflicting in the people that live in his town, in his state?” she said. “It shows a really horrible notion of what his power is ― or what he thinks it is.” Democratic members who invited Dreamers were similarly undaunted by Gosar’s remarks. Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-N.M.), the chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said during the press conference that she found it “personally offensive” that Gosar would interfere with her ability to represent her constituents. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) said during the press conference that lawmakers were doing their “duty” and guests should not be denied the ability to participate. “I would say to the congressman, you try it,” she said.Gosar even received a jab from a fellow Arizona Republican. Sen. Jeff Flake, who supports protections for Dreamers, retweeted Gosar’s comments with the message “This is why we can’t have nice things...” That led Gosar to jab back about the senator’s upcoming retirement. This story has been updated to include a comment from Ryan’s spokeswoman."

Raisman, a three-time Olympic gold medalist, revealed in November that Nassar abused her under the guise of medical treatment. Fellow gymnasts Simone Biles, Jordyn Wieber and McKayla Maroney also accused the former team doctor of sexual abuse.“He’s gonna die in jail, but any number is never enough,” Raisman said. “I’m glad because so many people are watching and I hope that it does set an example to all the other abusers out there that their time is up and that abuse is never OK.”Raisman has been an outspoken critic of USA Gymnastics, the U.S. Olympic Committee and Michigan State University for allowing Nassar’s abuse for more than two decades. “We have to fix the problem and the organizations,” Raisman said. Before Nassar’s sentencing hearing began on Jan. 16, Raisman tweeted that USA Gymnastics is “100 percent responsible” for the abuse, adding: “We must understand how this happened to make sure it never occurs again... The system has to change so that athletes are safe.” Raisman was one of more than 150 women to deliver victim impact statements in court during Nassar’s weeklong hearing. “Larry, you do realize now that we, this group of women you so heartlessly abused over such a long period of time, are now a force and you are nothing,” she said in court. Nassar was sentenced last week on seven counts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree. He had already been serving 60 years in prison on child pornography charges and awaits sentencing on three additionally counts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree. “When I was little I only thought that I could be hurt by a stranger,” Raisman told Us Weekly. “I mean, you have to teach kids that it could be someone that you’re very close with and... we have to teach them grooming techniques so they understand the warning signs of a predator.” "

O’Connell, a former executive director of the pro-choice Democratic group EMILY’s List, was billed as an experienced professional who could steady the party. A DNC spokesperson maintained that O’Connell was not ousted, and that her decision was personal in nature. O’Connell is due to stay on to help with the transition to a new CEO.O’Connell did not elaborate on her reasons for leaving in a farewell letter to voting DNC members. “I’m proud to have helped to rebuild our party at a time when we needed it most,” O’Connell wrote. “I am grateful to Chairman Tom Perez for the opportunity to serve during such a pivotal moment in our history as we fight with everything we’ve got to protect and promote Democratic values and to elect more Democrats nationwide.”During O’Connell’s tenure, the DNC played an important role in Democratic victories in special elections across the country, as well as the statewide elections in Virginia and New Jersey in November. For example, the DNC invested $1 million to elect Doug Jones to the open Senate seat in Alabama in December.The party body has come a long way since the 2016 presidential election, when it was penniless and mired in perceptions that it had favored Hillary Clinton during the presidential primary. In a bid to restore the health of the Democratic Party at the state level, the DNC increased monthly payments to state parties from $7,500 to $10,000. It also shepherded the proceedings of the Unity and Reform Commission, whose recommended changes to DNC budgeting and the presidential nominating process have drawn widespread praise.“When Jess walked in the door, the Democratic Party was broken,” DNC Chair Tom Perez wrote in a letter to staff. “Less than a year later, and we’ve flipped dozens of state legislative seats from red to blue across the country, we flipped the governorship in New Jersey, we elected Democrats up and down the ballot in Virginia, we’ve elected Democratic mayors in every corner of the country including a slew of black women who now run major American cities and we elected Doug Jones to the United States Senate in beet red Alabama.”Still, nearly a year into Perez’s chairmanship, the DNC continues to deal with staff shakeups and internecine dramas that feed perceptions of party unsteadiness. O’Connell’s departure follows the November ouster of DNC finance director Emily Mellencamp Smith. O’Connell’s exit also comes after griping from some state party chairs about the slow pace at which the DNC was distributing $10 million in promised innovation grants to state parties. Days after a Vice News report about the grants, the DNC announced it would give out its first $1 million bloc of awards. In addition, Perez, who defeated progressive favorite Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) for the DNC chairmanship, has struggled to secure the trust of the party’s restive left wing. In October, Perez sparked uproar from some DNC members and progressive activists when he stripped several Ellison supporters of their posts on key party committees.Several Democratic officials want Perez to appoint Ken Martin, Minnesota Democratic Party chairman and president of the Association of State Democratic Chairs, as O’Connell’s successor. Martin, who backed Ellison’s chairmanship bid, enjoys the confidence of progressive activists.“You need to pick somebody like a Ken Martin to be the CEO because you need somebody who is trusted by state party chairs and who understands the party infrastructure and culture,” said Jane Kleeb, Nebraska Democratic Party chairwoman, and a member of the board of Our Revolution, the legacy organization of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign. “There is no learning curve time.”Chris Reeves, a Kansas Democratic national committeeman, said Martin “would be a great hire.”Wisconsin Democratic Party Chairwoman Marth Laning said Martin would “be at the top of my list.” This article has been updated to include Perez’s letter to staff."

(The all-female rock band’s hits “We Got the Beat,” “Our Lips Are Sealed” and “Vacation” are sure to be showstoppers.) The show follows members of a royal family as they embark on an “extravagant journey wrought with mistaken identities, jealous lovers, sexual awakening, scandal and self-discovery, where everything (and everyone) is not quite what it seems,” according to a press release. Though details about her role are scarce, Peppermint is lined up to star opposite Broadway performers Andrew Durand, Tom Alan Robbins and Rachel York in the musical, which begins a limited engagement at San Francisco’s Curran Theatre in April before opening at the Hudson Theatre in New York on July 26. The show is directed by Michael Mayer, who won a Tony Award for “Spring Awakening,” and co-produced by Gwyneth Paltrow. Broadway should no doubt offer new visibility for Peppermint, who is set to become the second “Drag Race” contestant to appear on the Great White Way after Dwayne Cooper (aka Milan), who starred in the musicals “Motown” and “Hairspray.” In 2007, transgender performer Justin Vivian Bond was nominated for a Tony for a special theatrical event for the cabaret act, “Kiki & Herb: Alive on Broadway.” Peppermint’s stint, however, is set to mark the first time a trans performer creates a brand new role in a musical written for the Broadway stage. Peppermint recalled her decision to open up about her gender identity on “Drag Race” in an April interview with HuffPost. “I didn’t really want to come in and say, ‘Hey everyone, I don’t know your names but I’ve got an announcement to make,’ I just wanted to let my persona and my talent speak for themselves,” she said. “And once I felt comfortable and established in the room and this group of people and knew that it was a safe space then I felt comfortable enough to share personal moments with them – including my trans experience.”She elaborated further in a June interview with Slant, noting, “I’ve had people challenge me, and I’ve heard people declare that transgender people can’t be drag queens, and drag queens are not trans. And that’s certainly true for many people, but for me it’s not.”CLARIFICATION: This article has been updated to include information about previous trans performers on Broadway."

The number of children found at the border has increased sharply since April, after a drop early in the Trump administration.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a70a3961d000039006ad3d3.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After a sharp dip in early 2017, the number of children arriving from Central America has increased almost every month since April. Advocates say fears of gang violence in their home country are outweighing worries about deportation by the Trump administration.By Tim HendersonROCKVILLE, Md. — After a dramatic drop early last year, the number of Central American children crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally has been rising sharply since April.Advocates say the increase is being driven by fears of gang violence at home — fears that outweigh heightened concerns about deportation under the Trump administration.“The reality is these children are not necessarily coming to the U.S., they’re just trying to get away from their home country,” said Catherine Hulme, project manager and attorney for unaccompanied children at the Pro Bono Resource Center of Maryland in Baltimore.During the 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump promised to crack down on illegal immigration. And early in his administration, officials threatened to prosecute parents seeking to bring children from Central America.The number of children crossing the southwest border appears to reflect that. Fewer than a thousand children were caught alone at the border in April, down from 7,346 in November 2016.But their numbers have been increasing more recently, surpassing 4,000 in December. The number of family groups including children has increased even faster, growing from 1,118 in April to 8,121 in December.The vast majority of the arriving children — almost three-quarters of children caught alone and more than 95 percent of those caught with family — are from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.Unlike most Mexican children, children arriving alone from Central America cannot be immediately deported.Instead, they usually are turned over to the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement and live temporarily in a shelter, while their family or other sponsor can apply to gain custody of them. The children still face deportation proceedings in immigration courts.U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement warned last summer that the trip is “dangerous and unlawful” and said “if you have no basis to remain in the United States, you will be identified, apprehended and returned to your home country.”Brian Hastings, the Border Patrol’s acting chief of operations, blamed the increase on federal law that forces the agency to allow Central American children into the country rather than deporting them.“We are creating a draw for people,” Hastings said, adding that the agency is drafting legislation that would address the issue.When it comes to family groups, analysts say it’s not clear why the number is increasing, given that adults from Central America are subject to immediate deportation unless they can claim racial or political persecution to apply for asylum.“If an entire family comes together, you’d just be setting yourself up to be separated at the border and sent back,” said Maryland state Del. Ana Sol Gutierrez, a Democrat and El Salvador native who volunteers to translate for families in local courts. Some parents might feel a need to bring very small children themselves, rather than see them travel alone, Gutierrez said.Randy Capps, research director of U.S. programs at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute in Washington, said it’s possible some Central Americans are trying to sneak across the border with their families to avoid calling attention to relatives already in the United States illegally.“It could have something to do with risks of coming in unaccompanied and identifying potential sponsors,” Capps said.The children have been resettled in every state in recent years, with Los Angeles County getting the most between October 2016 and September 2017, at 2,893. Florida, Maryland, New York and Texas each had two counties in the top 10, and Virginia had one.Those who work with the young newcomers say most of the immigrant children talk of fleeing gang violence. “The gangs have taken over everything,” a 19-year-old told a Maryland magistrate last week, explaining why he fled Honduras in 2015 and is unable to return.Some analysts who favor tighter controls on immigration see the recent increase as a byproduct of moves to give legal status to so-called Dreamers, children brought to the United States illegally by parents years ago — even though the newcomers would not qualify for that status.“Any time there’s talk of amnesty, more illegal immigrants come thinking they can get some kind of status or be part of some future amnesty,” said Andrew Arthur, a fellow in law and policy at the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington, D.C., think tank that favors decreased immigration.Arthur said Border Patrol officers in South Texas told him that smugglers hesitated to bring children in early 2017, thinking the children might be turned back and they wouldn’t be paid. But as it became clear that children would still be reunited with their U.S. relatives, the traffic started up again, Arthur said.At a Maryland circuit court in this Washington, D.C., suburb, the 19-year-old from Honduras told the magistrate his story. He was playing ball in the street one day with five friends, all 13- and 14-year-old boys, and sat on the curb with them afterwards. He got up to leave first, and as he walked away, gangsters dressed as police officers walked up and killed the other five boys. The gang members fled, and he never learned why his friends were killed.“Nobody can live there now,” said the teenager, who now lives in Maryland with his mother. She came to the United States when he was a small child, sending money home to support him and his little brother, who made the trip with him in 2015.One way to get legal status is by gaining asylum, granted in cases in which unauthorized immigrants can show they were persecuted at home based on their religion, race or political beliefs. Another is through state family court rulings, such as those being sought here, that a child has been abandoned by at least one parent, which can lead to a green card for the child.Earlier that afternoon, a 15-year-old from El Salvador told the magistrate how his mother, a fast-food cook in Maryland, had sent for him and his little brother to come to the border last year.Had he waited until his 15th birthday, the boy said, the gangs would have recruited him by force. They scaled security fences at his school and took older boys away, threatening to kill their families if they refused, the boy said.“They say, ‘You’ll never see them again,’” he said in court. Now that he’s here, he said, he’s attending high school, likes science courses, and wants to join the Marines after graduation.Jennifer Alonso, who heads an immigration law firm in Maryland and represented one of the families seeking legal status for a child, said she’s spoken to thousands of children and parents in the past four years and “hears horrifying cases practically every week.” One Maryland man told her this month that his three nephews in El Salvador had been kidnapped and murdered, their bodies dismembered and scattered.“There is a great misconception that Central Americans are coming solely to work and for economic reasons,” Alonso said. “That may have been true in recent decades but right now, I can tell you they are coming out of fear.”Today’s migrant children and the families hosting them face more hostility under the Trump administration, said Valerie Twanmoh, director of the Esperanza Center in Baltimore, a charity that helps families reunite with children who were detained at the border.In Maryland, immigration authorities have contacted families and asked to see homes where children will live, Twanmoh said. This has raised concerns among some about exposing their immigration status, and some have backed out of agreements to host children.In Los Angeles, some parents are afraid to claim their children and turn to surrogate hosts who might be cruel to the children or force them to drop out of school and work, said Mercedes Núñez Roldán, a manager for released youth at an Esperanza center in Los Angeles. The center handled 2,300 children from the border in the past year. “You ask them how they’re related to the child and they say, ‘a friend,’” she said. One child ran away from such an arrangement and ended up sleeping at a construction site so he could stay in school, she said.But worries about deportation aren’t enough to stop many parents.“There’s no price that’s too high, if you’re trying to reunite with children,” Twanmoh said. Families might save for years to pay for the trip, she said, and the children sometimes travel for weeks or months to cross Mexico and get to the border.“You wouldn’t make that journey, as dangerous as it is, if you thought you could survive in your home country,” Twanmoh said. “No rational person would do it.”Stateline home pageSign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research "

They want to see us fighting for the right issues.”“We cannot be centrist any more,” she added. “We have to go back to our values.”The mere fact that Democratic leaders selected an outspoken liberal like Guzman to speak to the country on Tuesday reflects a leftward shift in the party’s balance of power.Guzman, who emigrated from Peru 20 years ago, is both a proud immigrants rights activist and an economic progressive in the mold of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Guzman passionately backed Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign and credits his admonition to run for office with inspiring her bid.Guzman ran for Virginia’s House of Delegates on a platform of raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour, securing paid sick days and universal pre-K. She also supports single-payer health care, commonly known as “Medicare for all,” and was one of 13 victorious Virginia House Democrats who signed a pledge to refuse campaign money from the state’s two largest utility monopolies. (In Virginia, which has no campaign finance limits, many critics believe that large utilities use their largesse to secure favorable legislation that effectively allows them to evade regulation.)“For the Democratic Party ... choosing me to do this speech I think is a message that we are ready to be united,” she said. “There is no more ‘progressive’ and ‘establishment.’ We want to be together.”Below is a complete transcript of her exchange with HuffPost about the matter:Most people would say you are solidly in the progressive corner of the party. You were endorsed by Our Revolution. Do you think it represents a change in the party to give you that platform? And how will you balance the need to address more moderate voters? "

Elizabeth Guzman (D) immigrated to the United States from Peru 20 years ago. As a single mother with a high school diploma and a certificate for bilingual clerical work, it was a challenge to make ends meet.Now, with two master’s degrees, a career as a management analyst for the city of Alexandria, and a watershed election win under her belt, Guzman, 44, is about to make her debut on the national stage. Virginia’s first Latina immigrant lawmaker will deliver the Democrats’ Spanish-language response to President Donald Trump’s State of Union address on Tuesday.“I can’t describe my emotions,” Guzman said. “It is an honor. And I’m happy to be able to be the voice of people that live in this country and are unhappy with the current administration.”A phone call from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who invited Guzman to make the speech, brought home the significance of the moment.“She was on the list of people that at some point I would like to know. But this happened so fast,” Guzman said.Guzman’s speech, which was recorded on Sunday, is expected to be broadcast on Univision, Telemundo and CNN Español. Guzman will attend the State of the Union address as Pelosi’s guest.Guzman first got involved in politics in 2008, when she volunteered for Barack Obama’s presidential campaign. Obama’s vision of making “this country a place that will be more inclusive, more welcoming, to respect each other regardless of your race” inspired Guzman, she recalled.But it was Guzman’s work on Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-Vt.) presidential campaign eight years later that would ultimately motivated her to run for office.Guzman vividly remembers a virtual town hall Sanders held with his convention delegates after he officially conceded the Democratic presidential nomination to Hillary Clinton. “He said if we really believe in his message about the working class ... policies and laws are taking place at the state and local level. And if we really wanted to create change, then we needed to run for office,” Guzman said.Guzman, who hails from Prince William County in the outer suburbs of Washington, D.C., took Sanders’ words to heart. She was tired of Republicans like Trump and then-Prince William County Board of Supervisors chairman Corey Stewart maligning her and her fellow immigrants.It was time, she decided, for a public official who actually represented the area’s growing community of Latino immigrants and could dispel, rather than abet, stereotypes about them.“My goal was to prove that if Latinos just get up and vote and make their voices heard, we could actually have fighters, people who are champions of immigrant issues, minority issues,” said Guzman.Guzman, who lives in Woodbridge with her husband and four children, went on to run for Virginia’s 31st House district and win comfortably. In the Democratic primary, Guzman beat Sara Townsend, the district’s previous Democratic candidate, by about 200 votes.In the general election, Guzman ran as an unapologetic progressive, advocating for issues including immigrant rights, organized labor and Medicare for all. She was one of 13 victorious Democrats who signed the anti-corruption group Activate Virginia’s pledge not to accept money from Dominion Energy or Appalachian Power Co., the state’s two largest utility monopolies. (In Virginia, which has no campaign finance limits, many critics believe that large utilities use their largesse to secure favorable legislation that effectively allows them to effectively evade regulation.)Guzman vowed to fight for working families like hers, emphasizing her support for universal health care, more early childhood education funding and a $15 minimum wage, which she considers a “family issue.”“I want these families to make more money so they can work less and spend more time with their children, so when their children grow up, they don’t make trouble,” Guzman said.As a result of her staunchly liberal positions, Guzman picked up the support of left-leaning groups like the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, the Working Families Party and Our Revolution, the legacy group from Sanders’ presidential run.But unlike some unabashedly progressive candidates, Guzman managed to stay in the good graces of the state’s Democratic Party, which aided her bid. She also had the backing of the Latino Victory Fund, which works to grow Latino political power, regional immigrants rights group CASA in Action, and the digital startups Flippable and Sister District, which helps elect Democratic state legislators. On the strength of small-dollar donations, Guzman went on to raise over $1.1 million ― the third-most of any Virginia House candidate. She defeated eight-term GOP incumbent Scott Lingamfelter by 10 percentage points on Election Day.Guzman and Kathy Tran were the first two immigrant women elected to the legislature; Guzman and Hala Ayala were Virginia’s first two Latina lawmakers.Guzman was part of an unexpectedly large Democratic wave in Virginia’s November election that brought Democrats to within a random name-drawing of a 50-50 tie in the state House.But when the dust settled, Republicans would have a 51-49 majority, ensuring continued GOP control of the lower chamber.Since arriving in Richmond this month for the new legislative session, Guzman has already experienced the limits of being in the chamber’s minority party. A bill she introduced that would require Virginia employers with 15 or more full-time employees to provide their workers with 40 hours a year of paid sick leave died in subcommittee.However, a bill Guzman introduced requiring the state to pay out transition assistance money to wrongly imprisoned individuals within 30 days of a request advanced out of subcommittee. She is hopeful for a similar fate for other legislation she is sponsoring, including an income tax credit for Virginians who install solar panels on their homes. The rough-and-tumble work of advancing a progressive agenda in a GOP-controlled state legislature can be frustrating and unglamorous.But Guzman’s State of the Union response Tuesday night will provide a respite from those complexities. It is an opportunity for Guzman to let her passion for helping ordinary people ring out unfiltered. Speaking directly to Spanish-speaking Americans, she plans to remind viewers that Democrats “will continue to fight for the working class.”“We will continue to fight to maintain programs that have been helping people, like the CHIP program and Medicaid,” she said.Guzman also plans to speak about the need to provide permanent legal protection to Dreamers, the undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children. Former President Barack Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program shielded some 800,000 of those individuals from deportation and allowed them to work legally. Trump announced in September that the program would end in March. Devising a compromise that would protect Dreamers with a legislative fix is currently the subject of heated negotiation in Congress.Guzman hopes Americans appreciate that parents who brought their children with them when they immigrated illegally for work did so to keep their families together.“I am pro-family. I want to have families united,” she said.When asked how she plans to balance her progressive views with the need to address more moderate voters as well, Guzman rejected the notion that a separate message is needed to address such voters.“We are just one Democratic Party,” Guzman said. “We have to be reminded that we are the party of the working class. We need to remember that the Democratic Party was formed by the unions.” “What happened in Virginia was a message that if we stick to our values, we can win elections,” she said. “And that’s what Americans want to see from us.”“We cannot be centrist any more,” she added. “We have to go back to our values.”"
83,POLITICS,Teleprompter Trump To Give His Big Speech. Twitter Trump Likely To Step All Over It.,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-sotu-twitter-teleprompter_us_5a6f8bf5e4b00d0de2230357,Even Republicans understand that Trump’s State of the Union message probably won't survive a few news cycles.,2018-01-30,"Donald Trump speaks in Selma, North Carolina, on Nov. 3, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a6f8d052d000049009431d0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump’s first State of the Union speech on Tuesday night will offer an “optimistic” and “forward-looking” view, according to his White House. He will detail the successes of his first year in office. He will reach out to Americans beyond his base.And, if the past is any guide, within days if not hours, not a word of it will matter in the least.While past presidents have used their highest-profile address of the year to get the nation’s attention and outline their priorities, Teleprompter Trump’s message will likely be stepped on by Twitter Trump and Random Comments to the Press Trump.Even Republicans acknowledge it.“All the talking heads will talk about it,” said one Republican National Committee member, who spoke on condition of anonymity to candidly discuss the president. “Until the next distraction.”And when would that distraction take place? Wednesday? Thursday? Late Tuesday night?“Good subject for an office pool,” the RNC member quipped.Also, if the past is any guide, Trump’s propensity for false statements will keep fact-checkers busy Tuesday night. According to a White House briefing that previewed the speech for reporters last week, Trump will sell the recently passed tax cut plan as “the biggest” ever ― a boast that is not accurate.Both the 1981 Ronald Reagan tax cuts and the 2001 George W. Bush tax cuts (made permanent by President Barack Obama in 2012) were larger. In all, seven tax cuts have been larger than the recent tax package as a percentage of the total economy, and three have been larger in inflation-adjusted dollars.Despite this, the senior Trump administration official hosting the briefing last week ― who spoke on the condition of anonymity at the insistence of the White House ― opened his remarks by calling the new law “the biggest tax cut in history.”The official said the theme of Trump’s speech would be “building a safe, strong and proud America” and that Trump would mention his “record-setting accomplishments.” In addition to bragging about the tax cuts, Trump would also highlight: his infrastructure plan to rebuild roads and bridges; his plan to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and reduce legal immigration while protecting undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children; his views on international trade; and his plan to increase spending on the military while “defeating terrorists around the world.”Trump spoke briefly about the speech on Monday at a White House photo opportunity, saying he hoped Democrats would work with him on the immigration plan because “the Republicans really don’t have the votes to get it done any other way.”He called it “a big speech, an important speech,” that would cover “a lot of territory,” adding: “We have a lot of things to discuss and we’ll be discussing them, and I hope you enjoy it.”Both as a candidate and as president, Trump has enjoyed good reviews with speeches written by his staff that he merely reads off a teleprompter ― despite his frequent ridicule of politicians who used the devices during the GOP primaries.Trump’s speech to a joint session of Congress last February, for example, brought praise from unlikely sources. “He became president of the United States in that moment,” proclaimed Van Jones, a former Obama adviser and now a CNN commentator.Yet within days, Trump was accusing Democratic congressional leaders of having ties to Russia and claiming ― with zero evidence ― that his predecessor had wiretapped him at his Trump Tower headquarters in New York City. Controversy after controversy about Trump’s words and actions followed, quickly burying whatever goodwill he’d earned in his speech.So while previous presidents could rely on days or even weeks of positive publicity for their proposals after their State of the Union addresses, few are expecting Trump’s speech to generate anything similar.“That won’t happen,” said Republican pollster Neil Newhouse. “This is a different kind of presidency.”Rory Cooper, a political consultant who worked in George W. Bush’s White House, said the State of the Union address can be a great opportunity to advance an agenda. Bush, in 2003, pushed the AIDS relief program PEPFAR, which a decade and a half later is recognized for its significant accomplishments in places like Africa.Cooper added, though, that he has no expectation that Trump will follow through on any of his stated goals. “Will President Trump stay on message afterwards and sell the agenda? Of course not,” he said. “But it will be instructive in a way.”"

Diane Keaton, whose career was launched by roles in Allen’s “Manhattan” and “Annie Hall,” is not among them, however. The actress tweeted a video on Monday that shows an interview Allen did with “60 Minutes” in 1992. “Woody Allen is my friend and I continue to believe him,” Keaton wrote. In the interview, Allen addresses allegations that he molested Farrow in her home when she was 7 years old. The incident allegedly happened during Allen’s breakup from Farrow’s mother, actress Mia Farrow. Allen claims Mia Farrow “coached [Dylan] methodically to tell this story.”“I have something very nasty planned for you,” Allen says Mia Farrow told him over the phone several weeks before the allegations came to light. The director also claims during the interview that Mia Farrow told him, “You took my daughter and I’m going to take yours” numerous times. Mia Farrow had recently learned that Allen was having an affair with her 21-year-old daughter Soon-Yi Previn, whom the actress had adopted with her previous husband. But Dylan Farrow has stood by her story.She published an open letter about the alleged incident in The New York Times in 2014. The letter included a personal appeal to Keaton: “You knew me when I was a little girl, Diane Keaton. Have you forgotten me?”That same year, Keaton told the Guardian that she barely knew Dylan Farrow and was not close with Mia Farrow.“I saw her maybe three times,” Keaton said of Dylan Farrow. “I didn’t know her.”"

She was shopping at Magic Carpet, an eclectic gift shop, when she overheard HuffPost asking the owner about Trump.

88,WORLD NEWS,Ireland Takes Major Step Forward In Path To Legal Abortion,Lydia O'Connor,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ireland-abortion-referendum_us_5a6fabbae4b05836a255d452,Voters will decide whether to revoke Ireland's strict ban in May.,2018-01-30,"Protestors against Ireland's abortion ban gather in Dublin, April 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58bde9f51500003b16abd8c0.jpeg?cache=WoYR0VkWNc&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Irish citizens will vote in May on whether to overturn a broad constitutional ban on abortion, lawmakers decided Monday.The ballot referendum, which Cabinet ministers unanimously voted to allow, will ask people whether they want to strike down the Eighth Amendment, a 1983 addition to Ireland’s Constitution that gave fetuses equal rights to people. It is one of the strictest abortion bans in the world and allows for the procedure only in pregnancies that threaten the mother’s life. In place of the amendment, the Irish legislature would take over the responsibility to craft laws on women’s reproductive rights.The exact wording of the amendment is still being worked out, the BBC noted, but last year a cross-party parliamentary committee recommended legalizing unrestricted abortion up to 12 weeks into the pregnancy. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar also agreed last weekend that the current ban needs to be liberalized.Varadkar, speaking to reporters after Monday’s vote, said the ban has been ineffective.“We already have abortion ― unsafe, unregulated, unlawful. We cannot continue to export our problem and import our solution,” he said, according to CNN. “I know this will be a difficult decision for the Irish people to make. For most of us, it is not a black-and-white issue ― it is very gray.”Irish abortion rights activists estimate that each day 10 Irish women on average travel to the United Kingdom for legal abortion services. From 2010 to 2012, there were 1,642 abortion pill packages sent to Ireland, other reports show. The great lengths Irish women must go to to seek out safe and legal abortions are time-consuming, expensive and emotionally taxing, women involved in the country’s abortion rights activism told HuffPost last year.Abortion rights activists celebrated Monday’s announcement, but they remain cautiously optimistic.The organization RepealEight urged the cabinet to set a firm date for the vote in May. Linda Kavanagh, president of the Abortion Rights Campaign, urged supporters to closely examine the final wording in the referendum.“Generations of people have fought too long and too hard for change in our abortion laws, and we will not accept any fudges or half-measures,” she said in a statement. “Modern, accessible and compassionate abortion care must be a guaranteed outcome of the referendum passing ― that is non-negotiable.”Tensions over the strict ban came to a head last March when thousands of women went on strike to urge a repeal of the amendment in honor of International Women’s Day. More than 4,000 protesters gathered at Dublin’s O’Connell Bridge and shut down multiple thoroughfares. Sister strikes took place in other Irish cities. "

Susan Collins (R-Me.), Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley and Sen. John Thune (R-SD) join former champion gymnasts Jeanette Antolin, Dominique Moceanu, Jamie Dantzscher and Mattie Larson for a news conference on January 30, 2018 in Washington, DC. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a70c65b1d000026006ad42b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The House passed a bill on Monday night that protects amateur athletes from sexual abuse by enforcing mandatory reporting regulations and extending the statute of limitations for child victims. The bill, which was sponsored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), came up for a vote one week after Larry Nassar was sentenced in what was the largest sexual abuse scandal in sports history. Congress agreed to use the Senate’s version of the bill to speed up its passage; it passed with a vote of 406-3. It just needs President Donald Trump’s signature to be made into law. Nassar was sentencing to 40 years to 175 years in prison on seven counts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree. The former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University doctor has been accused of sexually abusing more than 150 young women and girls under the guise of medical treatment.“As the Nassar sentencing comes to a close and the Olympic games quickly approach, we are reminded of the importance of protecting the safety and well-being of all of our athletes,” Rep. Susan Brooks (R-Ind.) said. The bill has a three-pronged approach to protecting athletes and regulating governing bodies of amateur athletics.First, it requires coaches, trainers and others to report any sexual abuse allegation to the police within a 24-hour period. Several women said they reported Nassar to MSU representatives and others as early as 1997, but Nassar’s abuse was allowed to continue because no one adhered to mandatory reporting regulations. Secondly, the legislation extends the statute of limitations to up to 10 years after a victim realizes he or she was abused. It’s not uncommon in child sexual abuse cases for survivors to have a delayed realization of the abuse they endured. Many of Nassar’s victims did not realize they had been abused until other women came forward with their stories. Lastly, the bill limits athletes under the age of 18 from being alone with an adult who isn’t their parent. Nassar often abused young girls while he was alone with them during medical visits, and many survivors said the isolation of elite gymnasts allowed the abuse to continue. “How a serial predator like Dr. Nassar could have preyed on so many young girls for a long time in such a flagrant fashion is appalling,” Rep. Ted Poe (R-Texas) said during a House debate of the bill. Rep. Lois Frankel (D-Fla.) addressed several athletes who helped create the bill, including Mattie Larson, Jamie Dantzscher and Jeanette Antolin, during a news conference on Tuesday. “It may be too late to protect these brave young women. But now you are here doing the protecting. You thought you’d be champion of the Olympics, but you are champions of human rights,” she said.Antolin told HuffPost that the bill is meant to protect all amateur athletes, not just gymnasts. “[This bill] goes across all amateur sports, not just gymnastics, not just swimming ― it’s all amateur sports to protect all kids,” she said. “Because all kids should be able to go and do sports without having to worry about adult predators.” Lawmakers from both parties have also called for an investigation into USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic Committee. “The abhorrent abuses associated with this case are outrageous, and raise serious concerns about your organization’s ability to oversee your sport and protect your athletes from abuse and mistreatment,” multiple members of Congress wrote in a letter to USA Gymnastics. Several officials at USA Gymnastics, MSU and the U.S. Olympic committee have resigned in the face of harsh criticism. MSU President Lou Anna K. Simon resigned last week. The entire USA Gymnastics board resigned, and former Olympic coach John Geddert retired. The NCAA also opened an investigation into how MSU handled the Nassar case. Nassar is currently serving 60 years in prison on child pornography charges and awaits sentencing on three other charges of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree.

They brought down the house, but some viewers still criticized the former Miss Universe’s dancing and outfit. Rivera said her time on stage was “a dream come true” and thanked the Recording Academy for inviting her and adding “a touch of sensuality” to the ceremony. “Joy and satisfaction, that’s how I describe my feelings in this instant,” she wrote in Spanish in an Instagram caption on Monday. “Last night I lived another memorable moment in my life, in which the world’s eyes were set on Puerto Rico. An island that has suffered like never before this past year but an island that keeps bringing talent and joy to the rest of the world through art.”The Puerto Rican beauty queen then addressed her critics. “P.S. (The day that all of those who have given negative criticism step on a Grammy stage, is the day their opinions will count. Meanwhile, stay looking pretty sitting on the other side of the television screen),” she wrote. Despite the criticism, a lot of people were very excited to see Rivera on stage and applauded her participation in the ceremony. The “Despacito” performance was a trending Twitter topic Sunday night, and the star-studded crowd responded with a standing ovation. The single was nominated for three Grammys, including Song of the Year and Record of the Year, but was ultimately snubbed. "
91,POLITICS,Only One President Had The Guts To Say The State Of The Union Is 'Not Good',Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/state-of-the-union-not-good-gerald-ford_us_5a70d62ae4b0be822ba12644,"He, of course, lost the next election.",2018-01-30,"President Gerald Ford said the state of the union was ""not good"" in his 1975 State of the Union address.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a70d78a2d00001f009433b2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The State of the Union is one of the most predictable set pieces of political theater in the United States. Washington’s partisan divide will be easily evident by who sits and who stands and claps. Some octogenarian senator will be caught asleep on camera. A military widow or a wounded soldier will be used as justification for continued overseas military operations ― and easy applause. No one will remember what policies were proposed. The opposition party response will doom the career of whoever gives it.And the president will declare, with much unnecessary buildup, that the state of the union is “strong.”Every year, no matter the state of the economy, the health of the people or the still-burning pile of rubble at the site of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the state of the union is “strong,” “stronger than before,” “much improved,” “good,” “sound” or maybe, if you are lucky, the “strongest it has ever been” or even “never been stronger.”That is unless you happen to be Gerald Ford (R), the 38th president of the United States.In January 1975, five months after acceding to the presidency in the wake of Richard Nixon’s (R) resignation, Ford gave his first State of the Union address. He recounted how when he was a freshman congressman from Michigan he sat in the House and witnessed President Harry Truman (D) declare that the state of the union was “good.”“Today, that freshman member from Michigan stands where Mr. Truman stood, and I must say to you that the state of the union is not good,” Ford said. Not good was an understatement. The nation was in the middle of a long recession, inflation ran wild, factories closed, crime rates soared and energy shocks and long gas lines were a recent memory. The continued debate over Nixon’s extreme corruption, which Ford had labeled “our long national nightmare,” still raged. And this is not to mention the continued revelations by congressional investigators about how the nation’s intelligence and law enforcement agencies routinely broke the law to undermine the civil and political rights of Americans.Still, “not good” is the most negative state a president has ever said the union has been in, according to the history of State of the Union addresses delivered to Congress.Not every president has opined on what the state of the union is in his State of the Union addresses, but those who did had never dared declare it anything less than “challenged,” as Lyndon Johnson (D) did in 1968. Ford actually leveled with the American people and said that, in truth, the state of the union was “not good.”No president has ever risked doing so again. Ford lost the election the next year to Jimmy Carter (D), previously the little-known governor of Georgia. (Although not a State of the Union address, Carter would make the same “mistake” in 1980 in his much-maligned “malaise speech.”)Since 1981, there has been a marked rise in the presidential declaration that the state of the union is “strong.” Ronald Reagan (R) declared the state of the union to be “strong” or “stronger” in four of his seven addresses. George H.W. Bush (R) said the state of the union was “strong” only once; he lost re-election. Bill Clinton (D) really formalized the use of the word “strong” in the address. In all seven of his State of the Union addresses, Clinton declared the state of the union to be “strong” or “growing stronger.” Since then, every State of the Union address from George W. Bush (R) and Barack Obama (D) has declared that the state of the union is strong, to some extent. The White House has already announced that President Donald Trump will declare on Tuesday that the state of the union is “strong.”The American people will have to wait 500 (fictional) years for another dose of negativity in the form of President Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho telling them he knows “shit is bad right now with all that starving bullshit.”But until then, we’ll always have Gerald Ford."

95,EDUCATION,Columbia University Refuses To Recognize Graduate Student Union,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/columbia-university-refuses-to-recognize-its-graduate-students-union_us_5a70e0cfe4b0a6aa487426e8,The Ivy League school is digging in for a long legal battle -- and relying on Donald Trump to help them out.,2018-01-30,Columbia's provost issued a letter to the school community on Tuesday saying the university would dispute the legitimacy of its graduate student union in court.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a70e34f160000450013942b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Columbia University’s graduate students voted overwhelmingly to unionize in late 2016, in an election certified by the federal government. But as far as the Ivy League school’s administration is concerned, the whole union thing was just a grad student fantasy ― one that President Donald Trump may help dissipate.In a letter Tuesday, Provost John H. Coatsworth told the school community that Columbia does not recognize the union’s legitimacy and intends to fight it in court. The school has dragged its feet on bargaining with the union, and Coatsworth’s letter makes clear Columbia will take the fight as far as it can, regardless of any damage the university’s reputation may suffer.Coatsworth acknowledged the decision to challenge the union wouldn’t be a popular one among students and alumni.“We recognize the potential, indeed the likelihood, for disappointment and dispute in our community,” he wrote. “Needless to say, we have not come to this decision lightly. Because of the principles at stake ― principles essential to the university’s mission of training scholars ― we have declined to bargain until the legal process has been allowed to run its course.” Coatsworth said the school will ask a federal appellate court to review the dispute. Meanwhile, the National Labor Relations Board ― which paved the way for the union ― could come to the school’s rescue under Trump. Indeed, Columbia and other supposedly liberal schools fighting grad student campaigns ― the University of Pennsylvania, Yale University, and Cornell University among them ― find themselves in the awkward position of hoping the Trump administration will deliver for them.The NLRB ― in one of its biggest decisions in years ― decided in August 2016 that Columbia graduate students were, in fact, employees of the school, and therefore eligible to unionize. The board determined that it didn’t matter whether the graduate students were there to be educated, as Columbia stressed ― they were paid to do work, which made them employees.That decision set up the grad-student vote to join the United Auto Workers. And it opened the door for grad students who teach at other private schools to exert their collective bargaining rights.But the union movement was dealt a major setback with Trump’s election. The president gets to fill open slots on the five-member NLRB, which referees disputes between employers and unions in the private sector. It was a liberal majority that decided the Columbia case in favor of the graduate students. A conservative majority is more likely to side with the schools and determine that grad students are ineligible to unionize.The board is currently split 2-2 along partisan lines due to the expiration of one member’s term. Once Trump names a fifth member and the Senate approves his pick, a full board may well revive the grad student question and rule instead against the right to unionize. It isn’t uncommon for the board to reverse precedent in a matter of years. In fact, the 2016 Columbia decision had overturned a 2004 ruling against grad students.As D. Taylor, the president of the Unite Here union that represents an array of workers in the hospitality and other industries, told HuffPost in October, the schools “are absolutely counting on Donald Trump.”"
96,POLITICS,These 'No Promo Homo' Laws Are Hurting LGBTQ Students Across America,Rebecca Klein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/no-promo-homo-laws-states_us_5a6f9178e4b05836a255ae94,Seven states still have laws that specifically target gay students.,2018-01-30,An Alabama law tells teachers to emphasize “that homosexuality is not a lifestyle acceptable to the general public.”,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a6fb70d1600004500139256.jpeg?cache=FVkNkd5l7I&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In Alabama, a statewide anti-bullying law calls on schools to develop policies that foster environments free of harassment, intimidation and violence.But for gay students, another state law directly impedes this goal. A different Alabama law calls on health educators to emphasize “that homosexuality is not a lifestyle acceptable to the general public.”Alabama is one of seven states that currently has a law barring teachers from positively portraying homosexuality in schools. These laws, sometimes called “no promo homo” laws, affect nearly 10 million public school students around the country. They work to decrease teachers’ support of these students and limit students’ access to necessary resources, according to a research brief released Tuesday from GLSEN, a nonprofit that works to support LGBTQ students. These laws range in severity. Some ban educators from broadly portraying homosexual people in a positive light. Others specifically call on educators to omit information or resources that would benefit gay students. In Arizona, when teaching about AIDS, health educators cannot include portrayals of “homosexuality as a positive alternative life-style” or suggest “that some methods of sex are safe methods of homosexual sex,” a law says.Utah had one of these laws up until July, when it was repealed, but information from the state is still included in the study. Texas, Arizona, Alabama, South Carolina, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Mississippi still have these laws. The anti-gay laws in these states operate alongside anti-bullying statutes, which all 50 states have. At a time when LGBTQ student experiences are improving on many ― but not all ― fronts, these laws represent dark spots of state-sanctioned prejudice.“So-called ‘No Promo Homo’ laws have a deeply disturbing chilling effect. However narrow the actual scope of the laws, teachers in states that have them are less likely to allow vital LGBTQ-related content in their classrooms, no matter the topic,” said GLSEN Executive Director Eliza Byard in a news release.GLSEN mined data from its own surveys of students and teachers along with a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study to glean information on what these laws might mean for students. Although these laws typically apply to health education, they can have spillover effects on an entire school’s attitude toward LGBTQ students, the brief found. Students in these states reported higher rates of bullying and less peer acceptance after accounting for factors like a state’s demographics and state education spending, but these differences disappeared after accounting for a state’s political leanings, measured as the percent of the population identifying as conservative. But in other areas, differences remained after accounting for all these outside factors. LGBTQ students in these states still reported having less supportive teachers, less access to Gay Straight Alliance clubs and less comprehensive anti-bullying school policies.Secondary school teachers in these states ― not just health educators ― also reported using a curriculum that was less likely to represent LGBTQ people or related topics.And health educators in these states were less likely to report having specific mental health services for gay students, or any recent professional development specific to this population. “The very students who need this information the most are the ones getting it the least,” GLSEN’s director of research, Emily Greytak, told HuffPost."
