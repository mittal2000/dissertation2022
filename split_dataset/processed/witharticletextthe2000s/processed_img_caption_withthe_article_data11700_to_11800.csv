En el exterior llevaban el logo de los Brasileros, con el #VamosChape, apoyando a que este pequeño equipo de fútbol se convierta en un gigante.   En el último video que se hizo antes de despegar, a cargo del canal Gigavisión, las risas se apoderan de la imagen, se siente la alegría de todos los que iban en el vuelo 2933, desde Sissy Arias la joven co-piloto, hija del dueño de dicho canal que a último momento decidió subir en el vuelo, hasta el mismo equipo que tomaban al avión Avro RJ85 como un amuleto, y estaban contentos por el buen trato que ya habían recibido. Era un avión familiar, dentro un negocio familiar, en un país que todo funciona de una manera familiar...y parecía que nada podía salir mal.  El martes, el mundo se despertó conmocionado, ante la noticia de que la noche pasada el avión se estrelló contra un cerro cerca a Medellín, donde debían aterrizar. 71 muertos de Brasil, Bolivia, Paraguay y Venezuela enlutaron a Sudamérica. Fue la primera vez que muchos escuchan sobre esta empresa LaMia, una empresa Venezolana, que funcionaba hace tres años en Bolivia y que tenía contratos de vuelos chárter con diferentes equipos de fútbol, empresas de turismo y con el sector de hidrocarburos y minería del país. No era la primera vez que hacía el recorrido de Santa Cruz a Medellín, a pesar de que se sabía que la capacidad de su gasolina no cumplía con las exigencias. Al piloto del avión familiar, le importo poco el volar con la gasolina justa para llegar a su destino, rompiendo con todas las normas de aviación, ""no es su culpa"", la verdad es que esta actitud es parte de la idiosincrasia boliviana. En Bolivia, todo funciona en familia y el profesionalismo vale menos que un pedazo de papel higiénico, al responsable se lo trata de ingenuo y mientras más tramposo seas, te va ir mejor, especialmente, si perteneces a alguno de los clanes familiares que están en el poder. Por eso, no me parece extraño, que el piloto no declare emergencia, sabiendo que ya no tiene gasolina, ""no es su culpa"", es parte de la idiosincrasia boliviana, que en vez de afrontar la responsabilidad de sus actos, el piloto del avión familiar, trate con mucho optimismo lograr aterrizar, sin tener que afrontar un juicio y una multa. Aquí no importa la vida de nadie, con tal de no asumir tu responsabilidad, todo vale.Pero aquí va el dato más importante ¿Por qué dejaron despegar un avión que tenía cinco observaciones en su plan de vuelo? ¿Por qué en Colombia pensaban que el avión, venía de Cobija y no de Santa Cruz? ¿Cómo una empresa que no está registrada en el Ministerio de Trabajo puede funcionar con el permiso de dos entidades gubernamentales como AASANA y la Dirección General de Aeronáutica Civil? ¿Y cómo tiene licencia si no cuenta con los requisitos exigidos? La respuesta es simple, porque era un avión familiar, en un negocio familiar, en un país que todo funciona en familia. El director de LaMia, Gustavo Vargas, es el padre de el director del Registro Aeronáutico Nacional Boliviano, la organización que aprueba licencia a los aviones, emite certificaciones y monitorea los asuntos legales que puedan afectar a los aviones y a las compañías operadoras. El Director de LaMia, un piloto militar retirado, que también fue piloto personal de Evo Morales, Tuto Quiroga y otros políticos bolivianos, ahora dice que ""no es su culpa"", que el ser el padre del que da los permisos de funcionamiento no tiene ""nada que ver"", que el no era socio de la aerolínea, solo su director general. Socio de LaMia, era el piloto, que se dejo llevar por el ""no me importismo"" y la idiosincrasia boliviana, pero fue el sistema corrupto que dio luz verde a que se realice un vuelo que nunca debió suceder. Ojalá que esta investigación no se quede 'en familia', como quisieran todas las autoridades bolivianas, y que caiga quien caiga, esta vez nuestros trapos sean lavados al sol.Encontrar a todos los responsables, no devolverá a la vida a las 71 personas, que confiaron en un sistema que se supone llevaría a una de las promesas futbolísticas de Brasil a cumplir un sueño anhelado, a periodistas a cubrir uno de los eventos deportivos más esperados en la región, a la tripulación que estaba orgullosa que su pequeña compañía sea elegida por extranjeros, a seres humanos de todas las edades que no esperaban morir ese día, pero castigar a los responsables, podría evitar otra tragedia similar y enseñarnos a los bolivianos, que el nepotismo y la corrupción de nuestra sociedad, nos esta costando demasiado caro.Co-Escrito con Andrea Monasterios."

Everyday of my life I will move forward. I will never move on. I have found over the past 3 years, 11 months and 17 days that when something horrible happens in your life it becomes wholly a part of you. So deeply ingrained like the ring a coffee cup makes on a table, or the crack in a bone after it has been broken-it is, you are, never the same. And so, you move forward-but you don't move on. You don't move on because you can't. Because what has happened becomes every second of every minute of every single day. But you do move forward, and if you are lucky you do so in a way that actually strengthens and bolsters you because you come to realize that you are able to move forward in spite of it, in the face of it-regardless of the fact that it consumes every ounce of your being. That's when you realize how powerful you are. You are still standing, breathing, loving, growing, hoping. You. Still. Are.And that's when you learn that life is not the things that knock us down. It's not the moments that literally take our breath away. It's not the moments where we are sure we will not be able to go on. Instead it's the moment(s) after. Where we come to realize that the darkness, the loss, the deep void-is not what defines us. But that it is how we choose to react. The choice to move forward, not on. We can each make that choice for ourselves to decide that the things that happen to us, do not have to define us."
2,POLITICS,North Carolina NAACP Fights Back Against Lawsuit Disenfranchising Black Voters,Julia Craven,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/naacp-north-carolina-lawsuit_us_5841ad4ae4b09e21702e468a,The Civitas Institute is waging a war against same-day registration.,2016-12-02,"The Rev. William Barber holds a press conference in Raleigh, North Carolina, discussing voting rights and voter suppression in the 2016 election, on Oct. 28, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5841b0111200002a00eed300.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The North Carolina NAACP said Friday it will file a motion to dismiss a lawsuit that would potentially allow Gov. Pat McCrory (R), who has been fighting to maintain the state’s highest office, to further draw out the 2016 election process.Francis De Luca, the president of the conservative think-tank Civitas Institute, filed a federal lawsuit on Nov. 22 against North Carolina’s Board of Elections, asking that election results not be certified until 90,000 voters who registered on the same day they voted have their addresses verified.De Luca’s lawsuit asks for an immediate injunction that would stop votes from being counted, claiming county election boards didn’t have enough time to verify same-day registrants’ addresses. Such a halt would stop the state from being able to announce the official outcome of the election until Dec. 7. While that’s only a few days away, the North Carolina NAACP wants the counting to continue because it sees the lawsuit as an attack on black voters, who are more likely to use same-day registration in North Carolina.“The De Luca plaintiff is doing no more than beating a dead horse, and unnecessarily, to extend the voting count in North Carolina,” said Irving Joyner, the legal counsel for the North Carolina NAACP, during a press call on Friday. North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper (D) declared victory over McCrory on Nov. 9 following a tight race. But McCrory did not concede, claiming the race was too close to call.Since then, McCrory has requested that more than 60,000 provisional and absentee ballots ― most of which were filed in Democratic strongholds ― be counted, filed for a statewide recount and logged election protests in 52 counties accusing dead people and felons of voting. A portion of his protests were dismissed, and on Dec. 1, Cooper’s lead over McCrory passed 10,000 votes, the threshold at which a candidate can request a statewide recount. It’s unclear whether the 90,000 votes being challenged by De Luca would help McCrory.De Luca and the Civitas Institute are in favor of eliminating same-day registration and requiring voters to have an ID, two rules implemented by North Carolina’s voter ID law in 2013. A federal appeals court struck down the law in July, after judges determined that Republican lawmakers in the state mandated specific ID requirements, shortened the early voting period and changed registration procedures in order to suppress black voters.The Rev. William Barber, the president of the North Carolina NAACP, said conservative efforts to challenge the election are ironic considering “they have been found guilty numerous times in the federal courts of engaging in voter suppression, voter schemes and race-based quota denial.”“Now they’re trying to suggest and project onto others their own guilt. They ran this election and they’re saying ― it would be laughable if it wasn’t so serious ― that they suppressed themselves,” he said.The current case is similar to another legal battle the North Carolina NAACP won in November. In that case, election officials in Beaufort, Moore and Cumberland Counties canceled voter registrations after mailers sent to voter addresses were returned as undeliverable. The North Carolina NAACP sued in response, claiming many of the voters still lived at the addresses on their registrations or had simply moved within the same county, allowing them to still vote there. The civil rights group said the cancelations were an attempt to suppress the black vote. U.S. District Judge Loretta Biggs, who called the state’s process for challenging voter registrations “insane,” ordered county election boards to restore the registrations on Nov. 4.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story said De Luca’s lawsuit targeted voters who registered on Election Day; the suit focused on voters who registered during an early voting period.Related Coverage:Here’s A Look Inside Election Protection Efforts In North Carolina"

Florida atheist and First Amendment activist Chaz Stevens has made the president-elect the subject of his “Distresstivus” Pole, placed next to a Nativity scene on city property in Deerfield Beach.That’s his version of a Festivus pole, the centerpiece of the secular holiday celebrated on Seinfeld known for its “airing of the grievances.”And when it comes to Trump, Stevens ― founder of the Religious Liberty Project ― has plenty of grievances.“Wrapped with an upside-down American flag (acknowledging the majority of Americans who didn’t vote for the Pumpkin In Chief), this year’s pole is shorter, a shout-out to Donald’s tiny hands,” Stevens said via email. “We’ve donned Distresstivus with the infamous Make America Great Again red cap, and fastened it all together with a big ol’ safety pin.”He is hoping to eventually burn the display and has applied for a fire permit from the city, but said he hasn’t heard back. Stevens has trolled Trump before. Earlier this year, members of his group wore a giant penis costume with Trump’s face as they crashed rallies.But it’s the holiday displays that have gained him national fame ― which may be ironic since his initial goal wasn’t to create a holiday scene, but to have the Nativity display in Deerfield Beach removed on First Amendment grounds.When the city refused, Stevens took a different tack and instead pushed for the inclusion of his own seasonal message ― choosing Festivus, with the pole each year themed to a topical issue.“I thought, ‘If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em,” Stevens told the Sun Sentinel last year, when he erected a rainbow-striped pole topped with a disco ball in celebration of gay rights. Last year’s poles were set up in at least five states, in capitol buildings and other public locations where governments have allowed Nativity scenes and other religious symbols. This year, Stevens has a pole going up in Delray Beach, also in Florida ― the third time it has been placed there ― along with the one in Deerfield Beach. “Additionally, we’re returning late this month to the Florida State Capitol rotunda, planting Distresstivus right down the hall from Gov. Skeletor’s office,” he said, referring to Florida Gov. Rick Scott. Stevens has eight poles ready to go. Supporters who want to see them erected around the country can contribute to the Religious Liberty Project."

Hope Hicks, the spokeswoman for the transition team who informed The Huffington Post that Trump made the sale, did not address a request to provide documentation of it.Barring additional information, it is impossible to verify the Trump transition team’s claim until the president-elect’s next financial disclosure in May 2017, which will show asset sales made in 2016. Trump earned $2,501 to $5,000 in interest income from bonds issued by Carrier’s parent company, United Technologies Inc., according to Trump’s May financial disclosure. That disclosure only shows income and asset sales for the previous calendar year. The Indy Star first reported Trump’s stake in the company. Had Trump not made the sale, he would have had a modest financial stake in the health of Carrier, the company with which he just negotiated a deal to keep 800 manufacturing jobs in the United States.Although Trump treated Carrier as a whipping post during the campaign, now that he has finalized a deal he has spoken about the company favorably, generating it positive national media attention.A Carrier spokeswoman declined to comment on the matter.Trump is already drawing pressure from ethics experts and congressional Democrats who are calling on him to divest from his myriad global businesses, including the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., which foreign governments are already patronizing as a way to curry favor with the incoming administration. They argue that these holdings could inappropriately influence his presidential decision-making."
5,POLITICS,Senate Democrat Urges Obama To Ensure The CIA Torture Report Won't Disappear,Laura Barrón-López,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ron-wyden-obama-cia-torture-report_us_5840d875e4b017f37fe3f262,Ron Wyden is worried the report could be destroyed under the Trump administration if it's not made a federal record.,2016-12-02,"The CIA torture report, an “exhaustive history with hundreds of footnotes,” should “at a minimum” be protected by becoming federal record, said Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.). President-elect Donald Trump promised during his campaign to ""bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding.”",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5840db8e1700002500e7d645.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― If President Barack Obama wants to codify his legacy on banning the use of torture in U.S. intelligence gathering, he should declassify the 6,700-page CIA torture report and make it a federal record, according to a top Senate Democrat. Ron Wyden, a vocal member of the Senate intelligence committee, has long urged the administration to declassify the report with necessary redactions. But now he’s pressuring Obama to make the report a document of federal record before he leaves office ― protecting it from possible destruction under a Donald Trump presidency. With Trump heading to the White House in just under two months, the Oregon Democrat told The Huffington Post it’s “more important than ever” that the American public know what is in the full torture report.Something Obama “can do today on this,” Wyden said, is “make sure the report isn’t destroyed and lost to history.”“All that the president needs to do is direct that the report be a federal record under the Federal Records Act, and an agency record pursuant to [the Freedom of Information Act], and then it can be disseminated widely to appropriate, cleared agencies,” Wyden said in his Capitol Hill office on Wednesday.On his second day in office Obama used his executive authority to ban “enhanced interrogation” techniques authorized by President George W. Bush, but his administration decided not to press charges against individuals involved in the torture program. Prompted by revelations that the CIA had destroyed videotapes of some of its interrogations, the Senate intelligence committee voted in 2009 to investigate the CIA’s detention and interrogation program. In December 2014, the Democrats on the committee released a 525-page executive summary of their findings. They concluded that the CIA’s interrogation program used techniques far more brutal than it had previously disclosed and misled the public about the efficacy of the program in producing intelligence.The full report remains classified. Lawyers who represent detainees at Guantanamo who were previously held at CIA black sites say the executive summary of the torture report reveals only a small part of the abuse their clients endured. The Obama administration has been less than eager to declassify the report, with agencies directed to keep their copies unopened. Even less transparency is expected from his successor. Trump, a real estate businessman with no prior government experience, said earlier this year that he would “bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding.” Trump’s sympathetic stance toward torture is why Wyden thinks the president-elect wouldn’t think twice about the destruction of a report long mired in controversy.“It seems to me ― and this’ll be the argument we’d be making to the administration ― that the president wants a legacy issue,” Wyden said. “This is something he can do today that will be very meaningful, and frankly we’re very concerned that it’s just going to get destroyed and that will be that.”Making the torture report a federal record would not require its declassification, but making it an agency record would open it up to a Freedom of Information Act request. Even then, it can be redacted in part or full. The report, an “exhaustive history with hundreds of footnotes,” should “at a minimum” be protected, Wyden said. He later clarified it has tens of thousands of footnotes.Wyden pointed to Trump’s campaign promises, the views of those he’s surrounding himself with, and comments made by his Republican colleagues as proof there’s a real threat the report could be lost forever.In January 2015, during his first month as chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) requested that the White House return every copy of the document that had been distributed to the administration officials and federal agencies. In a letter to Obama, Burr wrote: “I consider that report to be a highly classified and committee sensitive document.”“It should not be entered into any Executive Branch system of records,” Burr continued. At the time, Burr also said he planned to give back a critical secret document, the Panetta Review, that underpins the entire Senate investigation into the CIA’s torture program.Burr never got the copies of the torture report back; the White House said it would “preserve the status quo.” But once Republicans have complete control of the federal government from the White House on down, it only follows that Burr would again request to have the last copies of the secret report returned. And what he does with them after that is pretty much up to him. That means the fate of the infamous document would depend on individual senators like Wyden fighting to keep it in existence until it can be declassified. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who led the intel committee during the investigation and when the report was released, is also pushing for Obama to declassify the document. She hasn’t always been supportive, however. A New Yorker report published in the summer of 2015 said Wyden, then-Sen. Mark Udall (D-Colo.) and Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) rarely aligned with Feinstein on surveillance and tried to convince her to push for the entire declassification of the report. “Feinstein, concerned that the information in the full report would be too inflammatory, decided that the executive summary sufficed for the time being,” according to the New Yorker. She’s changed her mind since, and handed a letter to Vice President Joe Biden to give to Obama last week, urging him to make it public. “The time has come to declassify the report, allow the general public to make up its own mind,” Feinstein said, according to Politico. At least, those that’ll read 7,000 pages.”So far, the White House response has not been encouraging. “It was not a full-throated: ‘We are gonna declassify the report,” Wyden said of recent statements coming from the administration. “So we’ve got some heavy lifting to do on that.”In the final days of the Obama administration, Wyden says, he plans to focus on preserving the torture report so people understand what the CIA engaged in when interrogating suspected terrorists, and “that it’s contrary to our values; contrary to our laws.”“I want to amp up the concern I have to make sure that this full report is not destroyed,” he said. “That’s all the more reason why the report ought to be put in hands of American people so that you can have a real debate about this.”White House spokesman Ned Price didn’t comment on Obama’s plans for the report or on calls by Democratic senators for it to be declassified or made a federal record. “The President supported the declassification of the Summary, Findings, and Conclusions of the Senate’s report on detention and interrogation, with appropriate redactions for national security, in part to ensure certain practices were never employed again,” Price said. “We also have made clear that U.S. law prohibits torture without exception, and that all U.S. personnel are prohibited from engaging in torture at all times and in all places. Similarly, we reaffirmed our commitment to the Convention Against Torture, and have strongly backed Congressional efforts to codify key interrogation reforms from the Executive Order that the President signed nearly 8 years ago.”“To be sure, we have owned up to past mistakes and helped to right wrongs ―both at home and abroad,” Price continued. “As the President said in 2014, ‘No nation is perfect. But one of the strengths that makes America exceptional is our willingness to openly confront our past, face our imperfections, make changes and do better.’ That is precisely what we have done and will continue to do.”When Feinstein disseminated the copies nearly two years ago there were eight: one sent to the White House, two to the CIA (one for the inspector general, which was “mistakenly” deleted) and the rest to five different agencies. The White House declined to comment Thursday on the status of the various copies. Jessica Schulberg contributed reporting. "
6,POLITICS,The House Science Committee Doesn't Seem To Understand The Concept Of Winter,Nick Visser,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/house-science-committee-winter_us_5840d32ce4b0c68e048022cc,Why bother NASA when you can get your climate news from Breitbart?,2016-12-02,"Rep.

When we talk about climate change, we talk about changes in long-term averages of daily weather.”Scientists almost universally agree that the climate is changing and humans are the primary cause.But even if the House committee were just looking at weather, November was actually particularly warm. Mashable’s Andrew Freedman reports that the ratio of record highs to record lows was a staggering 51-to-1 last month, and 2016 is already expected to be the warmest year in recorded history.Climate scientists took to Twitter to lambast the tweet, as did an apparently livid Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).The Committee on Science, Space and Technology is chaired by Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas), a noted climate change denier with a 7 percent lifetime ranking from the League of Conservation Voters on environmental issues. In recent years, Smith has tried to intimidate and subpoena scientists into submission and has said the landmark Paris climate agreement is based in “science fiction.”Smith has received more than $693,000 from the oil and gas industry over the course of his career. Thursday’s tweet wasn’t the first anti-science message posted on the account. Others allege green groups “value politics and emotion over facts,” question countries’ abilities to meet climate goals and call the Paris climate deal “all pain and no gain.”The Huffington Post has reached out to Smith to see if he has access to the House’s Twitter account.Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Texas), the ranking member of the committee, said the tweet was “par for the course” when it comes to the majority’s actions in Congress.“They attempted to intimidate NOAA’s scientists over climate change research results that they didn’t like, put forth a NASA bill that gutted Earth science, and continuously attacked any effort on the part of the Administration to deal with climate change,” Johnson said in a statement to HuffPost. “This is all while those of us in the Minority have continuously sounded the drumbeat on the reality of climate change and the need for investments in clean energy technologies and climate change research and mitigation.”"

No, you wouldn’t,” taunted Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway. “That’s very clear to me. No, you wouldn’t. Respectfully.”“You guys are pathetic,” added David Bossie, Trump’s deputy campaign manager.The Harvard Institute of Politics’ quadrennial post-election forum is typically a seminar of interest only to political junkies. But Thursday’s discussion re-litigated the Trump team’s scorched-earth strategy of promising criminal prosecution of Clinton and showcasing the female accusers of her husband as a way to deflect attention from Trump’s long history of demeaning women and minorities ― including audio of him bragging of his ability to grab women by the genitals.The Clinton staffers pointed to Trump’s decision to bring in Steve Bannon ― who has boasted that his Breitbart News website had become a platform for white nationalists who call themselves the Alt-Right ― as the campaign’s CEO in August.That was on top of Trump’s use of racially charged language at his campaign events, the Clinton staffers said. “There were dog whistles sent out to people,” said Clinton pollster Joel Benenson. “Look at your rallies. He delivered it.”“You’re not being nice. You’re certainly not being analytical,” Conway responded.She argued that Trump successfully appealed to voters frustrated with their lack of economic progress in recent years, while Clinton failed to connect with them. “How in the world did we have a female candidate whose closing arguments were so negative?” Conway asked. “It was all about Donald Trump. She was obsessed with Donald Trump. Obsessed with calling him a racist, a xenophobe, a homophobe, a sexist. And guess where it got you.”Clinton had held polling leads over Trump through most of the summer and autumn, but saw her advantage narrow dramatically in the final days of the campaign, when FBI Director James Comey revealed he was looking at additional emails in the probe of Clinton’s private email server. He announced the weekend before the election that the new emails had not changed his earlier decision not to file charges.Trump wound up winning the Electoral College by a healthy margin, but losing the popular vote by 2.5 million. In fact, a swing of fewer than 100,000 votes across three key states would have given the presidency to Clinton."

Kristen Ashton, an administrator there, said the canine had no immediately apparent medical issues. Staff estimated he was around three years old, and appeared to be a Jack Russell terrier and Chihuahua mix.The dog has been at Regional Animal Services of King County since Wednesday, according to data on the shelter site. The shelter holds animals for 72 hours to see if anyone arrives to claim a missing pet, employee Chelsea Eykel told The Huffington Post. If no one comes forward, they can be put up for adoption.While he may have been angry when police picked him up, the doggie fashion plate appears to have calmed down. Eykel said the shelter hasn’t given him a formal temperament test, but so far, “he’s been fine.” A much more mellow photo of the little guy is up on the shelter’s site.He’s still wearing the pants and sweater in the photo, but Eykel assured HuffPost that they have since been removed."

The speaker said the two have discussed the Constitution.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58416d6b1700002500e7d6c3.jpeg?cache=2JdoegNROd&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"House Speaker Paul Ryan and President-elect Donald Trump have discussed the Constitution “extensively” in their “almost daily conversations.”In an excerpt of a “60 Minutes” interview that will air Sunday, Scott Pelley asked the speaker if Trump understands the role of the president and his obligation to work with Congress, rather than acting as “CEO of the United States.”“Oh, we’ve talked about that extensively,” Ryan said. “We’ve talked about the Constitution, Article 1, the separation of powers.”Still, it seems there are a few parts of the Constitution the pair could have spent some more time reviewing. Trump’s laundry list of comments about blocking constitutional rights touch on free speech, freedom of religion, due process and more.Earlier this week, Trump suggested Americans should lose citizenship or be jailed for burning the flag ― a completely legal act protected under the First Amendment. In March, he expressed his desire to “open up libel laws” so he could sue media outlets for negative press.Constitutional scholars have said Trump’s proposal to ban all Muslims from entering the United States “would violate the Constitution,” specifically the Equal Protection Clause. Ryan said the ban is “not what this party stands for and more importantly it’s not what this country stands for.”Disagreements between Ryan and Trump have been commonplace. Their rocky relationship has been peppered with name-calling, unflattering accusations and flip-flopping loyalty. Ryan held out on endorsing Trump throughout most of his campaign, though his resistance ultimately buckled in June.“I feel confident he would help us turn the ideas in this agenda into laws to help improve people’s lives,” Ryan announced in early June. “That’s why I’ll be voting for him this fall.”A few days later, he called Trump’s remarks about a judge’s Mexican heritage the “textbook definition of a racist comment.” In October, Ryan said he was “sickened” by Trump’s infamous “grab them by the pussy” hot mic scandal. Trump responded on Twitter by calling him “weak and ineffective.”But none of that matters to Ryan anymore, apparently. He confirmed to Pelley that they’ve “patched it up.”“We’re fine,” he said. “We’re not looking back. We’re looking forward.”"

Apparently it came from the company he has doggedly covered.,2016-12-02,Reporter Rafael Sanchez was denied access to cover Donald Trump's visit to the Carrier factory in Indianapolis.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When President-elect Donald Trump visited a Carrier Corp. factory in Indianapolis on Thursday that won’t be closing following his intervention, a journalist who had deeply investigated the company’s plans to move jobs to Mexico wasn’t permitted inside.The decision appears to have been made by Carrier and not the Trump team, which had regularly denied press credentials to news outlets during the presidential campaign. Rafael Sanchez, the chief investigator at ABC affiliate RTV6 in Indianapolis, told The Huffington Post that he applied for credentials through Trump’s site and received an email Thursday morning that his request had been denied. Sanchez said he was surprised because he’d covered Trump’s rallies in the state and the Republican convention in Cleveland.When Sanchez approached the Trump team, he said he was told to contact Carrier, who, as of Thursday evening, had not responded to his request. A Pence spokesman told Sanchez’s station that the Trump-Pence team hadn’t denied his access, which suggests someone at Carrier did. A Carrier spokeswoman did not respond to The Huffington Post’s request about why Sanchez was denied access. Sanchez has doggedly covered the decision by Carrier to send 1,400 jobs to Mexico, about half of which will now be staying in Indiana. This year, he’s spoken to dozens of workers and traveled to Monterrey, Mexico, to highlight how the company planned to pay workers there around $3 an hour. RTV6 produced a multi-part series on the expected move. Sanchez has clearly been aggressive over the past 10 months, including asking a top executive visiting the statehouse if he’d work for $3 an hour. But Sanchez told HuffPost that he’s always been upfront with Carrier on what he’s reporting and even informed them of his trip to Monterrey. “At no step in this journey has there been any surprises,” he said. In reporting on Carrier’s workers, Sanchez said he wasn’t looking for a “bash session” against the company but wanted to get their personal stories. “They were very honest about their lives,” he said. Sanchez indicated in a video statement Thursday that he’ll continue covering the company as he’s done. “I’m not angry. I’m not bothered,” Sanchez said on the video. “But I am committed today, and every day, to do my job. And if they don’t let me inside, that’s OK, I will still do my job.”"

Though various reports have narrowed the list to a half-dozen or so names, the final selection likely won’t be made for at least another week or two.In the meantime, focus has shifted to the names of the individuals Trump previously tasked to direct the transition of the department as part of his agriculture advisory committee, a group initially headed up by veteran D.C. food and agriculture lobbyist Michael Torrey.Torrey, whose recent clients include Little Caesar’s, the Snack Food Association and the soda-pushing American Beverage Association, abruptly resigned from the post last month after Trump announced a ban on lobbyists serving in the transition effort. Appointed in Torrey’s place was Joel Leftwich, staff director of the Senate Agriculture Committee and a long-time advisor for Senator Pat Roberts (R-Kansas).Leftwich himself is a former lobbyist, having worked for two years as senior director of public policy and government affairs for PepsiCo between 2013 and 2015 and, prior to that, serving for three months as the program manager of federal government affairs at chemical giant DuPont in 2010.Prior to that, Leftwich did work for a year as a congressional liaison to the USDA. (That was between 2004 and 2005, during George W. Bush’s second administration). But the industry ties of Leftwich and many other members of Trump’s ag advisory committee are alarming, if not surprising, to advocates for a healthy and sustainable food system.They fear that advancements on such issues during the Obama administration could be slowed or reversed altogether in the coming years.Jim O’Hara, director of health promotion policy at the nonprofit Center for Science in the Public Interest, told The Huffington Post that Leftwich’s background indicates industry interests may be prioritized by Trump’s USDA. This could mean a rollback of food safety laws or nutrition initiatives.“Obviously, having pro-industry folks on the transition team who are likely to put in place pro-business policies without balancing public health concerns is an issue of concern,” O’Hara said.Tiffany Finck-Haynes, food futures campaigner at the Friends of the Earth environmental nonprofit, agreed. Leftwich’s close affiliation with Sen. Roberts, the lead opponent to legislation allowing states to approve laws requiring genetically modified foods to be labeled, is alarming, she said.“Basically, Trump is replacing a lobbyist with a former lobbyist,” Finck-Haynes said. “That indicates to us that he is much more serious about protecting corporate interests than protecting the American public and the environment.”But other advocates are less concerned with the direction the Trump administration’s ag appointments appear to be heading.Scott Faber, vice president at the Environmental Working Group, described Leftwich’s past connections to industry as an asset given that many companies, including PepsiCo, are working to better cater their products to consumers’ demand for healthier, more sustainable choices.“He sort of straddles the divide where food companies tend to think the customer’s always right, while many farm lobbyists tend to think the customer’s always wrong,” Faber told HuffPost.Further, the revolving door between lobbying and posts like Leftwich’s isn’t particularly unusual — and that’s true of both Democratic and Republican administrations, according to Ferd Hoefner, policy director at the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition.While representing NSAC on the hill, Hoefner took part in meetings with Leftwich on the Senate Agriculture Committee, on issues like authorizing a farm-to-school program as part of the 2010 Child Nutrition Act. He described the experience as positive.“Joel certainly is someone who knows how things work,” Hoefner said. “He has a practical side. We may not always agree on positions, but we can certainly easily work together to move things forward.”Still, it will be too early to know exactly what a Trump administration will mean for our food system until the USDA secretary pick is announced.One apparent front-runner, Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller, a Republican, has raised eyebrows for both his temperament and food policy positions.Miller called Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton a “cunt” on Twitter last month, in a tweet he blamed on an error made by a campaign staffer. And he’s been labeled a “king of cupcakes and deep-fried advocate” for his junk food-inclusive approach to school nutrition.Trump’s selection this week of U.S. Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.) as secretary of health and human services, the agency that oversees the Food and Drug Administration, has also prompted concerns.As Politico reported Wednesday, Price’s congressional record includes voting against the Food Safety and Modernization Act and the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act. He also opposed menu labeling rules for convenience stores and grocers under the Affordable Care Act.Still, food advocates are pressing on.Regardless of whom the Trump administration selects as agriculture secretary, Tom Colicchio, celebrity chef and co-founder of the food advocacy group Food Policy Action, emphasized that his organization will push them to “take care of the health of our country across the board.”“We encourage Washington to keep turning the dial forward towards good food policy because that is what consumers want and every American deserves,” Colicchio said in an email.―-―Joseph Erbentraut covers promising innovations and challenges in the areas of food and water.

The magazine confirmed to The Huffington Post that they misquoted Kelly; the journalist said “staunch sexism.” The article has been updated to reflect this information. PREVIOUSLY:Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly recently denounced the sexism Melania Trump has faced. In an interview for Net-a-Porter’s Porter Magazine that hit newsstands Friday, Kelly said she “doesn’t want to get mired in [feminism]” but took a moment to talk about the “staunch sexism” Melania has experienced. “She’s been subjected to some really staunch sexism and I’ve been really offended on her behalf,” Kelly said. “The New York Times called her a trophy wife and a mannequin which is f-ed up and really offensive,” Kelly continued. “Just because she’s gorgeous doesn’t mean you get to dismiss her. She speaks I think five languages. She’s a mother. She’s a supportive wife. She’s an entrepreneur. I don’t know how successful her businesses are, but she’s out there trying. Screw them for saying that.” Kelly shared a similar sentiment on-air immediately after the NYT piece was published in September. Donald Trump tweeted at Kelly after the journalist had defended Melania. “Thank you [Megyn Kelly] for the nice things you said about Melania,” he tweeted. “You will like her, great heart and smart - always wanting to help people!”"

In early October, just after the Times published the tax documents, Lewandowski suggested that Trump sue the Times “into oblivion.”“There is no national security interest to Donald Trump’s taxes,” Lewandowski argued while also questioning whether the documents were accurate. (The Times verified the documents with Jack Mitnick, an accountant who handled Trump’s taxes for years. Mitnick called the documents “legit.”)In a late October interview with the Financial Times, Baquet criticized CNN for hiring Lewandowski, calling the move “outrageous” and describing Lewandowski as a “political shill.” Baquet said both CNN and Fox News’ coverage of the 2016 presidential election was “bad for democracy and those institutions.”CNN President Jeff Zucker received further backlash about Lewandowski’s time with the company at the Harvard post-election forum Thursday. According to Politico, as Zucker was criticized at the forum, Lewandowski attempted to defend himself, “insisting he was adding value to the CNN airwaves.”"

The gay actor-comedian, 28, has been eliciting howls on the national stand-up circuit for years. He’s also brought his signature wit to television in “Broad City” and “Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp,” and stole scenes on the big screen with small roles in “Other People” and “Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising.”But it’s “Search Party,” TBS’s binge-worthy new series, that’s giving Early his well-deserved breakout. The 10-episode comedy-thriller, which premiered Nov. 21 and is available for streaming in its entirety, skewers the type of Brooklyn-dwelling millennial culture of HBO’s “Girls” and tips its hat to the scares of “Stranger Things” while weaving in “Serial”-style suspense. In the show, the Tennessee native stars as Elliott, a sassy, self-involved New York fashion plate-turned-charity founder who, along with three friends, finds himself entangled in the mysterious disappearance of a college classmate he barely knew. Watch a clip of Early in “Search Party” and continue reading below.Even though Early has a field day delivering Elliott’s cheeky one-liners and eye rolls, he sees the role as a departure from his previous work. “I like to play very nervous characters who can’t string a sentence together, or who are always trying to control the moment, because it’s very easy for me to access,” Early, who described himself as “very nervous” in his offscreen life, told The Huffington Post. “Elliott is extremely confident, especially when he’s around his friends. He’s not afraid to have a sour opinion about things, and I just found that extremely liberating — to play someone who’s not constantly trying to maintain a facade.”It would be easy to dismiss the character as the show’s comic relief — the tried-and-true, classic sitcom “gay sidekick,” if you will — in the first few episodes of “Search Party.” But Elliott’s dark side emerges in the show’s final episodes, and the revelation is so deplorable, it’s amazing that his boyfriend, Marc (played by Jeffery Self), and pals Dory (Alia Shawkat), Drew (John Reynolds) and Portia (Meredith Hagner) don’t disown him on the spot.Acknowledging that Elliott “does some things that are purely for his image and not for the good of others,” Early sees the character’s less-than-savory attributes as a way of keeping him grounded in reality. “He has this really great philosophy, which is that lying and playing dirty is the only way to exist in the world. It’s just a part of being alive,” he said. “If you think you can be totally pure and totally good in your quest for meaning, then you’re naive.”With “Search Party” riding a wave of buzz, Early hopes fans will also take the time to check out a lesser-known Netflix series, “The Characters,” released in March. He wrote and starred in a “Characters” episode, and said it’s the project he’s most proud of to date. Having written his own stand-up material for years, he relished being involved behind the scenes as well as in front of the camera.Early told HuffPost he has no qualms about continuing to represent queer lives on stage and on screen. That dedication, in part, nabbed him a spot on this year’s the OUT 100, Out magazine’s annual list of the 100 most compelling LGBTQ people in the world. And whether or not a second season of “Search Party” gets the green light, however, Early vowed to “keep daring” himself moving forward. “All I can do is stay true to my own sensibility,” he said, “and stay away from projects that I feel are not helpful to the queer community.”It’s safe to say we’ll be watching!

And whether or not a second season of “Search Party” gets the green light, however, Early vowed to “keep daring” himself moving forward. “All I can do is stay true to my own sensibility,” he said, “and stay away from projects that I feel are not helpful to the queer community.”It’s safe to say we’ll be watching!

But now, the documentary is even more necessary, given President-elect Donald Trump’s takes on global warming (hoax invented by the Chinese), the environmental Paris Agreement (bad deal) and his environmental-related cabinet positions (appointing and still considering climate change deniers).If you’ve already seen a few climate change films or read articles about what’s happening, “Before The Flood” probably won’t do much in the way of surprising you about the dire state of the Earth’s environment at the moment. Honorably, that wasn’t the intention, as Stevens sacrificed the chance to make a groundbreaking documentary to instead make one that would educate those who haven’t learned what’s going on yet.“We weren’t going after the people that watch climate change docs and already know all this stuff,” explained Stevens. “We did want to change the mind of people that never would think about it and make them start caring. Make them understand how big this issue is and how important it is. And we wanted this [to be] for young people, kids in high school. Kids in college. That was really our goal.”Due to DiCaprio’s partnership in making this movie, compelling narratives conveying this important information became possibilities. Among numerous climate experts, “Before The Flood” features interviews with Secretary of State John Kerry, President Barack Obama and Pope Francis.Aside from his charisma and celebrity draw, Stevens insists DiCaprio was an invaluable partner in making sure this movie was actually educational. “I think when you see celebrities doing these movies with causes, often you feel like you’re watching a puff piece,” said Stevens. “But with Leo, he knew a lot [about climate change], he’s passionate about it.”Stevens also explained that DiCaprio had a pretty bleak view of the climate’s chances before making “Before the Flood,” but through his access to higher-level officials, the actor was persuaded into thinking we might be able to solve some problems.“He had a much more pessimistic outlook,” Stevens said. “And you get to see Leo [in the movie] ― and in real life this happened ― he became much more optimistic.”Of course, this optimism has been deflated by Trump winning the election, which Stevens expressed on the phone. Still, he wants to remain hopeful.“What we need to do is force Trump to put people in positions of power in terms of the head of the EPA, in terms of our Secretary of Energy, our Secretary of the Interior [and] our Attorney General. People that believe in climate change. And we are going to have to have a united front,” he said.Unfortunately, since our conversation, Trump announced his pick of Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) for the Attorney General spot. Sessions is actually featured in the documentary for being a member of Congress that has been bad for the environment. Sessions is a climate change sceptic.“I’ll tell you what I’m going to do. I’m going to do everything in my power to make this administration understand that climate change is real and it’s urgent and it’s happening now,” insisted Stevens. “Republicans that believe in climate change ― that can lead ― those are the people I’m trying to get to. That’s what we have to do, we all have to work together. It’s our planet.”Recently, Trump has slightly retreated from his oppositional stances on trying to prevent climate change and perhaps there is still hope.“When his son [Barron Trump, 10] is 50 years old, if we don’t do something now, it’s going to be a very, very sad place for him,” said Stevens.If you’ve been justifiably worried about what could happen to our environment under Trump’s presidency, and are unsure exactly what coming challenges will need the most work to solve, watching DiCaprio and Stevens’ “Before The Flood” is an easy way to get involved.

19,THE WORLDPOST,"As Brazil Mourns The Chapecoense Plane Crash, Its Congress Guts Anti-Corruption Laws",Travis Waldron,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/brazil-corruption-law_us_584195a6e4b0c68e04805e8b,"“In the dead of night, they took advantage of a moment of national mourning.""",2016-12-02,Fans of the Chapecoense soccer club gathered to mourn the Monday plane crash that killed 71 people.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5841cc0a1200002a00eed37f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The lead prosecutor of a high-profile corruption case in Brazil is accusing the government of using the tragedy of a recent plane crash to sneakily pass a law that will protect dirty officials.On Tuesday, after a chartered flight carrying the Brazilian soccer club Chapecoense crashed in Colombia and killed 71 people on board, Brazil President Michel Temer declared a three-day period of national mourning.Hours later, the lower house of the Brazilian Congress overwhelmingly voted to gut an anti-corruption bill in a way that public prosecutors and political observers say could ensure lawmakers don’t come under scrutiny.The original version of the proposed 10 Measures law sought to root out political corruption amid Brazil’s ongoing Operation Car Wash money laundering investigation, which could ultimately implicate dozens of lawmakers for taking improper bribes from the state-owned oil giant Petrobras. The scandal, along with the September impeachment of former President Dilma Rousseff, has thrown the country into political crisis.But late on Tuesday night, Congress instead approved a version of the bill that included provisions allowing defendants to sue prosecutors and judges for overstepping their powers. The new version, which passed 450-1, also increases potential prison sentences for prosecutors and judges, a move prosecutors interpreted as an effort to put an end to Car Wash investigations and threaten the independence of the government’s judicial branch.Deltan Dallagnol, one of the lead prosecutors in the Car Wash investigation, criticized the legislation in a Facebook post on Wednesday, saying that it “undermines the independence of the prosecution and the judiciary.”When the plane carrying top Brazilian soccer club Chapecoense to the final of the Copa Sudamericana crashed in the mountains of Medellin, Colombia, late Monday night, it killed all but five on board. The sudden loss led to nationwide sadness. The upstart club’s Cinderella run to the final of South America’s second-largest tournament had enraptured Brazilians.“In the dead of night, [lawmakers] took advantage of a moment of national mourning and shock to subvert the proposals,” Dallagnol told The Guardian of the vote.Paulo Sotero, the director of the Brazil Initiative at the Woodrow Wilson International Center in Washington, also saw the maneuver as a cynical attempt to take advantage of the crash.“These people will use anything and everything to try to save themselves,” Sotero, speaking from Sao Paulo, said. “People here are very hurt, and people are shocked. [Lawmakers] are probably trying to use the fact that people are very emotionally exposed here to try to pass this.”The process in the lower house repeated itself Wednesday in the Brazilian Senate, but with a different outcome: Senate leader Renan Calheiros attempted to push the bill through in a late night vote, only to see it blocked. The Brazilian Supreme Court on Thursday voted that Calheiros should face trial for embezzlement, which he denies. The version of the bill approved in the lower house maintains some of the original anti-corruption measures. But it also removes rewards and protections for whistleblowers and amends the types of penalties lawmakers can face as a result of corruption, and the new, controversial elements undermine the original provisions, some observers said.“The few points of the original proposal that remained are not enough to contain the major damage caused by inserting into the legislation intimidating measures against judges,” Marlon Reis, a judge and founder of the Movement to Combat Electoral Corruption, told HuffPost Brazil.Temer, who is facing growing unpopularity, has previously hinted that he will veto the package of reforms if it shields lawmakers from corruption probes. Top Brazilian public prosecutors, including those in charge of the Car Wash investigations, have threatened to resign en masse if the protection measures become law.“The prosecutors of the Car Wash Task Force hereby express rejection of any attempt to terrorize attorneys, prosecutors and judges in their legitimate exercise of the research activity, processing and prosecution of crimes, especially those committed in the highest spheres of power,” Dallagnol wrote in his Facebook post.Rodrigo Maia, the president of Brazil’s Congress, countered those arguments, telling reporters Wednesday that the process of revising the 10 Measures bill and legislating a new version of it was “very transparent.”Sotero, of the Wilson Center, said the lawmakers’ attempt to force through changes to the anti-corruption bill has only strengthened Brazilians’ resolve to carry through with the Car Wash investigation. He predicted that the efforts to amend the 10 Measures bill the way lawmakers hoped are finished. “That legislation to water down Car Wash will not make progress. It is dead politically,” Sotero said. “The judicial branch and the prosecutors have mobilized, and society is mobilized.”“The tolerance of impunity for people in high places is over,” he added. In another controversial move, Brazil’s Senate on Tuesday approved a package of austerity measures aimed at reigning in federal spending.The measures, a Temer priority, would cap federal spending levels for 20 years, a move that could pose threats to public health, education and other social programs. Ahead of the vote, the possibility of austerity sparked massive protests from students and other opponents of the proposed caps across the capital city of Brasilia.The political turmoil has even begun to spill into Chapecoense’s weekend funeral ceremonies for the players who died.Temer is reportedly planning to skip the services out of apparent fear that disenchanted crowds will boo him. The president instead reportedly asked families of players who died to meet him at the airport so he could share his condolences, angering the father of at least one player.“No, I’m not going to the airport,” said Osmar Machado, the father of defender Filipe Machado, who died in the crash. “He has to come here. Do you think I’m going to leave my son here and go there to give him a hug, just because he is the president? What’s the importance of giving him a hug. It’s even a lack of respect for him to stay there.”HuffPost Brazil’s Marcella Fernandes contributed reporting. This story has been updated with comments from Paulo Sotero and Osmar Machado."

That’s 2 percent of the city’s population, or double the rate that constitutes an “epidemic” in the eyes of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nancy Mahon, global executive director of the MAC AIDS Fund, the philanthropic arm of the cosmetic company MAC, says it’s “shameful” that the infection rate is so high “in the backyard of our nation’s Capitol” ― especially given the United States’ leading role in funding international AIDS work. While D.C.’s infection rate has fallen from its height of 3 percent in 2009 ― a rate that was higher than that of West Africa ― the level of infection is still unacceptable, said D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser at an event Thursday kicking off the city’s newest plan to combat the epidemic. Last year, Bowser and the city’s department of health announced that they would work with the Washington AIDS Partnership and the DC Appleseed Center for Law and Justice on an initiative to end the HIV epidemic in the District by 2020. The effort, they said, would be known as the 90/90/90/50 Plan.They outlined the details of that plan on Thursday, during an event scheduled to coincide with World AIDS Day. The plan stresses four goals: to ensure that 90 percent of D.C. residents living with HIV will know their status; that 90 percent of people diagnosed with HIV will be in treatment; that 90 percent of people in treatment will achieve viral load suppression; and that there will be a 50 percent decrease in new HIV infections, all by 2020.This plan builds on the 90-90-90 goals that UNAIDS, the United Nations organization committed to dealing with the disease, set out two years ago. D.C. joins New York state and San Francisco, which have set similar goals. Those places are leading the charge nationally, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease. “This plan is the kind of thing that leads to a tidal wave of cities trying to copy cities,” Fauci told The Huffington Post. “The goal is that we should be striving for this worldwide, but if we can do this in the U.S. in high-level cities, this is a good step in the right direction.”To achieve those goals, D.C. plans to build on the success of the city’s needle exchange program, which has reduced the number of new HIV cases among injection drug users by 95 percent since it was introduced in 2007. The city’s plans also include educational programs for health care providers, a push to reduce the stigma around the disease, and an effort to increase public awareness and accessibility of treatments like Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis, or PrEP ― a drug regimen used to prevent infections among people who are at high risk for contracting HIV. It also calls for renewed efforts to make sure D.C. residents have access to stable housing, which the plan’s authors say is essential to overall wellness goals.The MAC AIDS Fund has also provided a $1 million grant for a marketing campaign to encourage D.C.’s black women to use PrEP. Black women are the second highest at-risk group in the district, accounting for 1 in 6 new HIV diagnoses.“I don’t think it’s any mistake that both the mayor and the director [of the D.C. Department of Health] are African-American women, and they are the first people in the country to do this,” Mahon said ― a reference to Bowser and to DOH’s Dr. LaQuandra Nesbitt.The MAC AIDS Fund has donated a total of $8.7 million to D.C. over the past decade. The latest grant is part of its $6.6 million initiative aimed at curbing HIV rates in cities around the globe, with campaigns in Paris, Berlin, Mexico City and London.Walter Smith, the executive director of DC Appleseed, a nonprofit organization dedicated to solving public policy problems in the nation’s capital, said Thursday that the innovation in D.C.’s 90/90/90/50 Plan lies in its public and private partnerships, which he hopes can serve as an example for other cities.“Given where we started, we came from a situation where the District of Columbia was setting a bad example for the nation ― we all knew where we were with HIV/AIDS was absolutely unacceptable,” he said. “We have come so far [from] that with this plan. We are on the verge of setting a good example for the nation.”Fauci went even further in his praise.“The dynamics of plans like this,” he said, “can turn around outbreaks.”"

22,POLITICS,Jill Stein’s Recount Campaign Is Winning Her New Fame -- And Losing Her The Green Party,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jill-stein-recount-green-party_us_5840b6f9e4b0c68e048011af,Party leaders are suspicious of their presidential nominee’s post-election strategy.,2016-12-02,"Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein has generated excitement -- and controversy -- with her campaign to recount votes in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein’s crowd-funded election recount is finally underway in Wisconsin ― and it enjoys the cooperation of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. The recount is shaping up to be a huge source of media attention and fundraising for Stein, who barely registered on the national radar during the election. But, ironically, an initiative that has endeared Stein to some of the Democrats who once scorned her is upsetting many of the Green Party leaders who were her most loyal supporters. Mainly, they question Stein’s choice of states and what they say is her willingness to work with ― and serve the interests of ― Democrats. Andrea Merida Cuellar, co-chair of the national Green Party, argues that recounts in states like Texas ― where a Green Party railroad commissioner candidate narrowly missed the 5 percent threshold needed to secure the party 2018 ballot access ― would have been more important for the party as a whole.“This doesn’t really help us in our party-building efforts, in state party building,” Merida said.Merida also believes the party should have higher priorities when it comes to restoring integrity to the voting process. She cites as an example the implementation of ranked choice voting, a process gaining traction in some states and cities.“We have a whole slate of things we need to focus on to make sure that the next time somebody runs, we have a strong state party network to support that candidacy,” Merida said.Kevin Zeese, a senior adviser to Stein’s campaign, longtime Green Party activist and former political candidate, echoed Merida’s sentiments.“There are many other election integrity issues. A lot of them are at the registration and preventing people from voting levels that have a massive effect on the outcome,” Zeese said. Zeese also worries that recounts that simply reprocess the ballots through optical scanners or electronic voting machines, rather than recounting them manually, will not expose issues inherent in the electronic voting process.A Wisconsin judge ruled on Tuesday night that the Stein campaign could not compel Wisconsin counties to recount all ballots by hand. Forty-seven of the Badger State’s 72 counties have nonetheless chosen to count them by hand, and an additional 13 counties will use a combination of manual counting and optical scanners.In Michigan, which uses only paper ballots counted by optical scanners, a pending recount will be done entirely by hand. But Zeese is discouraged by the level of Democratic Party involvement in that effort, which raises his doubts that it will be conducted with complete integrity.Mark Brewer, for example, an attorney Stein has hired to represent the recount effort in Michigan, is a former chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party.LuAnne Kozma, campaign director of the Committee to Ban Fracking in Michigan and a Green Party activist, pointed out several other Democratic Party-affiliated figures involved in the Michigan recount effort in a widely circulated email condemning the recount.“We had a good crew of hard-working volunteers. We built the party,” Kozma wrote, referring to Green Party election efforts. “Now thisnews is devastating us and we’ve been completely sidelined and blindsided.”Even Stein’s running mate, Ajamu Baraka, is opposed to the effort.“It would be seen as carrying the water for the Democrats,” Baraka told CNN on Tuesday.Stein shocked the political world last week when she announced an effort to crowd-fund recounts in the closely fought battleground states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. The Michigan recount was scheduled to begin Friday until the Trump campaign objected, arguing that, as a fourth-place finisher in the state, Stein cannot be considered “‘aggrieved’ by any alleged fraud or mistake.” The recount is now on hold, and Michigan’s Board of State Canvassers will consider the objection on Friday. Meanwhile, in Pennsylvania, the Department of State is estimating that voters have petitioned for recounts in over 200 precincts in counties across the state. Counties, which have the discretion to accept these requests, are now assessing them.No candidate is legally entitled to finance a statewide recount in Pennsylvania unless they demonstrate that there was illegal activity in the way the election was conducted. The Stein campaign is contesting the Pennsylvania election with a lawsuit in Pennsylvania’s Commonwealth Court and has a hearing scheduled for Monday morning.Although Stein faces accusations of suckering disgruntled Clinton voters to enhance her brand and raise funds for unrelated purposes, her decision to pick the three states that narrowly cost Clinton the election appears to have captured some Democrats’ imaginations. Stein, who received no more than 1 percent of the vote in each of the three states, surprised many observers by shattering her $2 million fundraising goal within hours of launching the crowd-funding campaign last week.Stein has since increased its goal several times, citing Wisconsin state officials’ higher estimates of the cost of a recount and other unforeseen expenses. Thus far the campaign has raised $6.8 million of its latest $9.5 million goal. For its part, the Wisconsin Elections Commission maintains that its estimate of $3.5 million was its first real projection and that any previous figures put forward were based loosely on the cost of past recounts.Stein denies that the recount is about anything other than authenticating the results, however. “Verifying the vote through this recount is the only way to confirm that every vote has been counted securely and accurately and is not compromised by machine or human error, or by tampering or hacking,” Stein said in a statement. “The recount does not benefit one candidate over another. It benefits all voters across the political spectrum. This is an essential first step to restore confidence in our elections and trust in our democracy.”In the Wisconsin and Pennsylvania recount petitions, as grounds for concerns about electronic vote tampering, Stein cites the analysis of University of Michigan data scientist J. Alex Halderman and the hacking of emails from the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. Stein also mentioned the disconnect between most pre-election polling and election results.The Stein campaign’s press staff did not respond to requests for comment on the specific criticism of Green Party leaders.In addition to practical concerns with a recount seemingly tailored to solicit Democratic support, Stein’s Green Party critics have ideological concerns about the collaboration with Democrats.For instance, the Wisconsin petition and Pennsylvania lawsuit’s references to the possible involvement of the Russian government in election tampering due to its alleged role in the DNC and Podesta email hacks dismayed Merida. She believes the accusations against Russia have yet to be substantiated and are being used to ratchet up tensions between the two countries ― something Stein stood against during her campaign.“This is a candidate who was in Russia two years ago and was doing this because we are a party of peace,” Merida said. “For her to now say the Russians did it because they supposedly hacked into DNC email servers ― it’s disconcerting to say the least.”Both Zeese and Merida lament that Stein’s campaign did not solicit the input of top Green Party officials before deciding to go forward. The campaign presented it to the Green Party steering committee as a “fait accompli,” according to Merida.“She just did it unilaterally and didn’t talk to people. She could have done New Hampshire or Maine ― small, easy states ― and then it wouldn’t have been about Clinton,” Zeese said. Neither Zeese nor Merida was willing to question the genuineness of Stein’s motives. But Merida made it clear that the future of the party should not be so tied to Stein’s presidential campaign. “Jill Stein is not the Green Party. She is simply a member of the Green Party,” Merida said. “At this point after Election Day, we do have to recalibrate within the Green Party toward the Green Party and away from the Jill Stein campaign,” she added."

The bad news is the uptick, which follows several years of historically low growth in health care spending, means health care made up an even larger share of the U.S. economy, reaching 17.8 percent in 2015, a 0.4 percentage point increase. The independent Office of the Actuary at the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service published the new data in the journal Health Affairs.Total national expenditures grew by 5.8 percent in 2015, the largest year-to-year increase since 2007, and 0.5 percentage points faster than in 2014, when the Affordable Care Act’s expansion of coverage began. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, more than 20 million previously uninsured people have gained coverage from private health insurance or Medicaid since 2014, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported the uninsured rate is at an all-time low.“Our significant progress in reducing the nation’s uninsured rate, while providing strong protections for Americans if they get sick, would not be possible without the Affordable Care Act,” Andy Slavitt, acting CMS administrator, said in a press release. “As millions more Americans have obtained health insurance, per-person cost growth remains at historically modest levels.”From 2009 to 2013, health care spending rose at the lowest annual rates in the more than half-century that the actuaries have produced these annual reports, increasing an average of just 4 percent a year over that time. This followed decades of more rapid acceleration in health care spending that at times reached double digits per year.The consensus has been that this unusually slow growth was mainly a consequence of the Great Recession and slow recovery at the beginning of this decade. Historically, Americans spend less on health care during economic downturns because of job loss and lower income, and expenditures rebound when the economy improves.That pattern appears to have repeated itself, but President Barack Obama’s administration and some economists also believe the cost-containment provisions of the 2010 health care reform law contributed to the slowdown by encouraging efficiencies in the health care system, even as it ramped up spending on medical care for newly covered people. And the nation is spending less on health care than projected before Obama enacted the Affordable Care Act.The coverage expansion is reflected in the 2015 spending patterns. Expenditures on hospital care, physician and clinical services rose faster than during the prior year as people received more medical care. Prescription drug spending growth, by contrast, slowed compared to 2014. Notably, rising prices for medical services and products were less a factor in overall spending growth than was the increase in the amount and intensity of medical care people received in 2014 and 2015. That breaks with historical trends, when price hikes constituted a bigger share of the year-to-year growth.The results of the election make predicting future trends difficult. Prior to Donald Trump’s winning the White House and Republicans’ maintaining control of Congress ― putting them in position to repeal the Affordable Care Act and make other, sweeping changes to the health care system ― the actuaries at the Medicare agency had projected that overall spending would rise by an average of 5.8 percent a year from 2015 to 2025, and that health care eventually would constitute one-fifth of gross domestic product. Doing away with the Affordable Care Act would dramatically change the equation. Eliminating the law’s Medicaid expansion, the subsidies it provides for private insurance and its guarantee of coverage for people with pre-existing conditions will shrink the insurance rolls and reduce costs for the federal government. But repeal also would do away with cost-containment policies, such as not paying hospitals to re-treat patients for the same condition if they must return within 30 days for more care. And some portion of the reduced federal spending will simply shift to individuals paying out of pocket for health care and to hospitals and others that will provide charity care and absorb unpaid bills.Trump and congressional Republicans also vow to devise a new health care agenda that will succeed the Affordable Care Act, but since they currently have no such plan ― and may not for another three years ― evaluating its effects on health care spending is problematic."

The conditions are staggeringly common, yet there’s still a huge stigma surrounding them. This often makes people avoid seeking treatment.Lovato hopes that by sharing her story she motivates her fans to seek support if they’re dealing with a mental illness. And, most importantly, that they stick with their treatment plan outlined by their physician.“That relationship is ongoing — it’s not something where you see a therapist once or you see your psychiatrist once, it’s something you maintain to make sure that you want to live with mental illness,” she stressed. “You have to take care of yourself.”Well said."

26,THE WORLDPOST,Here's Why Trump Should Continue Obama's Progress on the Opening With Cuba,"Abraham Lowenthal, ContributorProfessor Emeritus of International Relations, University of S...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-obama-castro_us_584038f6e4b09e21702cec2c,"If Trump rolls back the rapprochement, it could provoke the Cuban government to further close its society.",2016-12-02,People celebrate the news of Castro's death in Miami on Nov. 26.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58403c7e1a00002500ccaaee.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"With his customary sense of drama, Fidel Castro managed, finally, to exit the stage in Cuba just as Donald Trump emerged to take the spotlight of U.S. politics as president-elect. After taking power in Havana in January 1959, when Dwight D. Eisenhower was president of the U.S., Castro went on to outlast 10 U.S. presidencies.Since his illness in 2006, Fidel has been gradually moving off center stage, but he has still written occasional commentaries, sniping at hints of economic reforms and rapprochement with the U.S., making occasional ceremonial appearances and meeting with foreign dignitaries.Now, finally, Fidel has passed away. Cubans as well as Cuban Americans and others around the world wonder how Cuba will evolve after him, and what role the U.S. can and should play in Cuba’s transition to a post-Castro world. Immediate reactions in Miami to Fidel’s death suggest that there are still a few Cuban refugees who cling to the dream of returning, reclaiming their property and perhaps living there much as they did before the Cuban revolution. But this mirage is ever receding. Others, both in the younger Cuban-American community and in the general U.S. business community, hope for a rapid transition to a new Cuba, open to democratic politics and attractive business prospects.Some, from both these groups, have begun to press President-elect Trump to move things along faster by reversing some of the rapprochement that Cuban President Raul Castro and U.S. President Barack Obama initiated, and conditioning any further expansion of U.S.-Cuban interchange on Cuban concessions to the U.S., both economic and political. They have been urging Trump to insist on immediate and clear steps to open democratic politics, to protect human and political rights and to release the remaining political prisoners, including those convicted of treason against the state. They also call for improved conditions for capitalist investment and the recognition of property claims.Trump has responded by indicating that if Cuba does not make concessions along these lines, offering Cuban Americans and the whole American people “a better deal,” he will reverse the Obama administration’s measures to open up communications. As president, Trump could do that quite easily, as Obama used executive orders, which Trump can reverse, to move normalization along.Although it would be relatively easy for Trump to upend normalization of relations with Cuba and to win kudos from an important voting bloc in a perennial battleground state, it would be a bad mistake for the administration to take this course, one a pragmatic and innovative leader should resist. The idea of using economic sanctions and political pressures to force Cuba to reverse its revolution and bow to U.S. preferences undergirded the U.S. policy of denial and isolation against Cuba for five decades without any positive result.It is only in the past couple of years, since the bold initiatives by Raul Castro and Obama to turn the corner together and seek a mutually respectful relationship, that there has been significant movement toward greater travel, exchange of people and ideas, cultural and educational exchange and measures to open Cuba to new thinking and influences. Expanding these openings will predictably accelerate Cuban reforms over time, not as concessions to Washington, but because of the dynamics Cuba’s opening unleashes. Cutting off these trends would give the Cuban government every incentive and argument to repress and further close its society.Fidel Castro is reviled in many circles in the U.S., to some extent for good reason, a dictator who substituted his ego and ambitions for public consultation and decisions. But he is still a revered figure among many Cubans, especially of a certain age, partly because of his personal charisma, partly because of social and educational programs, but mainly because he stood up resolutely to the Yankees, insisting vehemently on Cuban national sovereignty and rooting out pervasive U.S. influence and domination. Even among young Cubans, Castro is admired for resisting Yankee bullying and interference, so salient in the country’s past. As history evolves, Fidel’s name and legacy in Cuba will not be primarily about the construction of “socialism,” which is bound to give way over time, but rather about the building of a sovereign Cuban nation, able and willing to stand up to Uncle Sam and others.The only way Fidel Castro can be resuscitated as a truly important political influence on Cuba’s future at this point is if the Trump administration attacks or undermines Cuban sovereignty, disrespects its nationalism and offends Cuban sensibilities in ways that unite Cubans against contacts and exchanges with the people of the U.S. That would be a tragic and colossal unforced error, one that Donald Trump can and should avoid."

The participants were separated into two groups: one that performed aerobic activity multiple times per week ― including workouts on a treadmill, elliptical and stationary bike ― and a control group that only engaged in stretching exercises. The researchers then conducted MRI scans on the participants and gave them tests that measured their executive functioning, which controls mental tasks such as paying attention in a meeting.Those who exercised at least four times a week experienced an increase in overall volume and gray matter in some areas of the brain including the temporal lobe, which is associated with short-term memory. Those who only did stretching also experienced an increase, but the exercise group had greater gains. The exercise group also showed a better performance in executive functioning, whereas the stretching group saw no improvement.“Any type of exercise can be beneficial,” study co-author Jeongchul Kim of the Wake Forest School of Medicine said in a statement. “If possible, aerobic activity may create potential benefits for higher cognitive functioning.”This study may be particularly important to dementia research because those with mild cognitive impairment are at an increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease. Exercise is already known to boost gray matter, a major component of the central nervous system; the loss of grey matter is associated with Alzheimer’s. There are some caveats to the study. The sample size is small, for starters. And the average age of the adults who participated was 63 for the exercise group and 67 for the stretching group - approximately the age at which Alzheimer’s symptoms typically appear. This means that the researchers aren’t sure what effect exercise would have on other age groups, and more research is needed in order to make a definitive conclusion.Regardless, it’s a positive step. After all, only good can come from physical activity.Who’s ready to hit the gym?"
28,THE WORLDPOST,Weekend Roundup: Populists Grow Stronger Once in Power,"Nathan Gardels, ContributorEditor-in-chief, The WorldPost",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/weekend-roundup-146_us_5840b093e4b09e21702ddc54,But it all ends badly. History has not absolved the personalist rule of Fidel Castro or any of the others who took the populist path to power.,2016-12-02,Former Cuban leader Fidel Castro passed away last week. He was 90.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/584103fe1a00002500ccad6e.jpeg?cache=XJ1UR2qAYL&ops=crop_3_3_908_566%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Populists, caudillos and strongmen in power don’t fail at the outset, they gain strength. That is because their personalist rule delivers up front to the constituencies that brought them to the top, often challenging bothersome institutional constraints along the way. They worry about the consequences later. The real troubles begin when the consequences arrive, revealing how the short term has eaten the long term. Then the bad overtakes the good.As the classicist Phillip Freeman has written in The WorldPost, this has been true going back to Clodius in the Roman republic, whose popularity soared as he handed out free grain to the plebeians. But the divisive character of his mercurial rule drove the republic to the point of civil war and opened the way for the dictatorship of Caesar to restore order. In the 1950s in Argentina, Juan and Eva Peron fostered many programs to elevate the poor descamisados (shirtless ones) until corruption, debt and inflation overwhelmed any gains and the military ultimately stepped in to stem the chaos. In Venezuela, Hugo Chavez unquestionably lifted the welfare of the poor the elites had ignored through programs like misiones sociales, but in the end squandered immense oil resources, became heavily indebted to China and whose policies now, under the rule of his successor Nicolás Maduro, have ignited 500 percent, if not more, inflation. Store shelves are empty, medicines are scarce, daily protests fill the streets and citizens that see little hope are fleeing economic collapse by the boatload. This pattern also fits Fidel Castro. Though he arrived in power by the bullet instead of the ballot, his rallying cry was populist, nationalist and above all, personalist. He accomplished near universal literacy and free health care for all in that tiny Caribbean island. In the end, though, his caudillo-like rule crushed dissent and personal liberties while his Soviet-style economy, abetted by the U.S. blockade, drove the nation into an impoverished cul-de-sac. History has not absolved Castro or any of the others who took the populist path to power.Whether Donald Trump fits this pattern, as former Mexican President Vicente Fox argues, remains to be seen. As president-elect, Trump has claimed to have saved some 800 to 1,000 jobs in Indiana from moving to Mexico. His pledge of a $1 trillion dollar infrastructure surge has so far helped boost the stock market and will surely create significant new employment with far reaching multiplier effects if it comes to pass. Since no populist politician has ever before occupied the top office of the world’s most powerful nation in modern times, we don’t know what to expect. America is a profoundly pluralist and ethnically diverse society bound by constitutional constraints more hallowed than elsewhere. This context bears little resemblance to where populism has been empowered before.The flashing red light that cannot escape concern, however, is the very personalist style of operation that brought Donald Trump to power through scapegoating invective against the outside world and perceived enemies within. If troubles appear later on, will he revert to the path that brought him to where he is or abide by the norms of civility and restraint that have limited the authority of every previous American president? All who want America to succeed are obliged to give Trump the benefit of the doubt for now since the democratic ballot box has put him in the White House. But that red light needs to remain flashing every step of the way. Emily Peck contends that Donald Trump has “his eye on the wrong ball” by blaming trade for job losses. As true as that may have been in the past, the real threat of job displacement in the future, she writes, comes from Amazon’s takeover of the economy. Ryszard Petru and Guy Verhofstadt, the European Union’s top negotiator on Brexit, take on the populist wave heading to the European continent in the wake of Trump’s victory in the America. “One of the greatest delusions spread by populists on both the left and right,” they argue, “is that turning inwards will empower us. The reality is that in an inter-connected world, no one European country can influence global trade rules. And make no mistake: if we abandon shaping the environment around us, others will shape us.” Writing from Paris, Anne Sinclair worries that “the political future of France has never been more uncertain.” “Time will reveal,” she writes, “if Marine Le Pen will be able to cause the greatest political earthquake in France since the Liberation.”Following Fidel’s death at 90 last week, several contributions evaluate his life and times. Mark Beeson looks as the triumphs and failures of the Cuban revolution in the context of the struggle against inequality across Latin America. Michelle Manning Barish brings a personal family perspective to the Cuban experience. She warns against romanticizing the Cuban revolution, writing that, “the only people who know the real history of Castro in Cuba are the ones who lived it.” Based on recent conversations in Havana, Abraham Lowenthal cautions that a post-Castro Cuba is not likely to change quickly as a result of the Obama opening – and certainly not if Trump reverses course once in office. In other global matters, Sam Stein and Jessica Schulberg report from Washington that foreign policy experts are lining up to press the incoming Trump administration to keep the Iran nuclear deal or risk a nuclear arms race in the Mideast. Former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown calls for an international investigation of the Russian-Syrian role in the deadly bombing of a school in the village of Haas which killed dozens of people, mostly children. Eric Olander and Cobus van Staden report on how Rwanda is positioning itself as a hub for Chinese investment in Africa. Jeffie Lam of our South China Morning Post partner reports on the rise and fall of the independence movement in Hong Kong. Earlier in the week, the Post reported that Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, told journalists that calls for independence should not be confused with the struggle for greater democracy, which he supports. Writing from Perth, Australia Helen Clark reports that Vietnam is looking to the combined weight of the Association of East Asian Nations, or ASEAN, as a way for smaller nations in the region to protect and promote their interests as the U.S. and China battle for influence.Stefano Baldolini writes from Italy that a “no” outcome of the referendum this weekend over key constitutional reforms that diminish the role of the Italian Senate and give more power to the prime minister could spark a new round of instability across Europe. India is rapidly joining the renewable revolution. Elyse Wanshel reports that India has built the world’s largest solar plant in eight months, and it generates enough power for 150,000 homes. The news is not so good elsewhere. Ryan Grenoble reports that, “There’s substantially less sea ice in the world than ever before. The Arctic ― and, for completely unrelated reasons, the Antarctic ― just closed out November with less ice than any other year in history.” There is joy in life if you lighten up and let God’s mercy in. That is the takeaway, Carol Kuruvilla writes, for Pope Francis from his favorite film, “Babette’s Feast.” The film depicts an austere Protestant town of joyless inhabitants disrupted by a generous French cook in exile who brings them all together in happy fellowship around a meticulously prepared meal. Writing from Istanbul, novelist Kaya Genc describes how the ongoing political chaos in Turkey is re-energizing the arts scene. “Young Turks,” he writes, are “turning to art in trouble times.” Finally, our Singularity series this week examines the global contest, especially between the U.S. and China, over the most powerful supercomputer.

29,POLITICS,BuzzFeed CEO Argues Against UK Office Unionizing,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/buzzfeed-ceo-uk-union_us_5840389be4b017f37fe2e6ee,"But under UK law, the unionization effort is effectively a done deal.",2016-12-01,BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti plans to meet with the news site's London staff to discuss their unionization.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/584038ee1a00000b03ccaae5.jpeg?cache=5myxiUqIrU&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti is hoping he can change the minds of British employees who just decided to join a union.A majority of BuzzFeed UK’s editorial staff signed cards announcing they had elected to join Britain’s National Union of Journalists, BuzzFeed reported on Wednesday.Although the announcement amounts to a formal request for recognition of the union from management, United Kingdom labor laws mean workers don’t need their employer’s agreement to form a union, making the effort essentially a done deal.But that is not stopping Peretti from a last-ditch attempt to convince the company’s 80 London-based editorial workers that unionizing is against their interests. Peretti sent BuzzFeed UK staff an email acknowledging that “some” employees had signed union cards. He announced that the company’s head of human resources would be traveling to London to discuss the matter and that he would follow suit next week.“Before any decision is made, it is incredibly important to me that I have a direct line of communication with all of you, that I know about any concerns, complaints, or suggestions for improvement you have, and that we can speak openly and directly with each other,” Peretti wrote. “Lenke Taylor, our Chief People Officer, feels the same way and has worked with the U.S. editorial team to improve clarity of job titles, career paths, compensation benchmarking, benefits, diversity initiatives, and securing additional budget to fund these programs. We were in the process of extending this to the UK when we received the union letter and we’d like an opportunity to talk directly with you before you make any irreversible decisions.”Unions typically view such mandatory, so-called captive audience meetings, which are common in U.S. private-sector workplaces, as attempts to intimidate workers with veiled threats about what unionizing will mean for their future. “Editorial staff are keen to engage positively with management on a range of concerns and see this as a constructive opportunity to do that,” NUJ organizer Laura Davison told HuffPost. “We welcome the CEO’s comment that the people who work at the company are a top priority and would like to reassure him that a majority of editorial staff rather than some support recognition. Staff are the lifeblood of creativity at the company and they enjoy their work. Far from stifling it they want to enhance the success of the company by working together.”NUJ confirmed to HuffPost, however, that in the UK, if the majority of staff in the bargaining unit want recognition, it will ultimately proceed.Peretti has made no secret of his opposition to a union at BuzzFeed. He elicited criticism for remarks in August 2015 in which he said unions were appropriate for workers “on an assembly line” but counterproductive for “new-economy companies... where there’s an alliance between managers and employees.” He claimed at the time that unionizing would actually result in lower pay for BuzzFeed employees.The digital news chief defended and reiterated his argument in Wednesday’s email, maintaining that a union would, among other things, hinder workplace flexibility.“Unions represent employees around a rigid skillset that doesn’t reflect the fluid and flexible way we work, they introduce an extra layer of bureaucracy and process, and they unnecessarily divide our teams, limiting the many benefits of everyone being part of a venture backed tech company,” Peretti wrote. Contrary to Peretti’s assertions, however, digital media workers are often just as eager as their bosses to avoid collectively bargained contracts that limit their workplace opportunities. Some recent contracts negotiated by staff unions at Gawker Media, Vice and ThinkProgress define job titles broadly with considerable room for interpretation.His contention that unions interfere with relations between employees and their managers is a classic union avoidance talking point. In reality, regardless of how fond employees are of their bosses, they typically seek union representation because they realize that without it they are at the mercy of management on a wide array of issues ranging from layoffs to pay and benefits.Peretti’s comments represent an attempt to keep at bay a wave of unionization sweeping the digital media industry. As internet-based news sites have matured in recent years, their workers have begun seeking the protections of collective bargaining enjoyed by many peers in legacy media organizations.The Huffington Post became the largest such operation to unionize, receiving voluntary recognition from management in January.Other news sites’ leaders have, like Peretti, taken a more confrontational approach. Both Law360 and Fusion tried to convince employees not to unionize in captive audience meetings before agreeing to hold secret ballot elections on unionization. The workplaces’ staff voted overwhelmingly to unionize in both instances."

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) on Thursday praised her onetime opponent Scott Brown, who President-elect Donald Trump is considering nominating to be secretary of veteran affairs.In an interview with Boston’s WGBH, Warren offered enthusiastic support for Brown, whom she unseated in the often-contentious 2012 Massachusetts Senate race. “If Scott Brown is the nominee for Veterans Affairs, I have no doubt that he would put his heart and soul into trying to help veterans,” she said. “And I would put my heart and soul into trying to help him do that. You bet I’d support that.”Warren has a personal stake in the Department of Veteran Affairs ― all three of her brothers served in the military.“We obviously spoke about my passion and his passion, which is veterans and veterans issues,” Brown said last month. “And obviously I think the toughest job in the Cabinet is leading the VA, because while it has so many great angels working there, it has great problems as well.” Later Thursday, he thanked Warren for her support:Trump is reportedly also considering 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin for the role. Rep. Jeff Miller (R-Fla.) has been floated for the post as well. Warren’s praise may be more curse than blessing for Brown. The Democrat is fiercely critical of Trump and his nascent administration. In turn, Trump has frequently berated Warren, mockingly calling her “Pocahontas” in reference to a 2012 controversy over her claims of Cherokee heritage. Warren also discussed the potential nomination of 2012 GOP presidential nominee and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney as secretary of state, but stopped short of endorsing him. “I’d like to hear more,” she said. “But I think Mitt Romney is a smart man, and I think he’s got a pretty level headed view of the world.”This story has been updated to include Brown’s tweet."

(Reuters) - U.S. military veterans were arriving on Thursday at a camp to join thousands of activists braving snow and freezing temperatures to protest a pipeline project near a Native American reservation in North Dakota.However, other veterans in the state took exception to the efforts of the group organizing veterans to act as human shields for the protesters, saying the nature of the protests reflected poorly on the participants.Protesters have spent months rallying against plans to route the $3.8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline beneath a lake near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation, saying it poses a threat to water resources and sacred Native American sites.State officials on Monday ordered activists to vacate the Oceti Sakowin camp, located on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers land near Cannon Ball, North Dakota, citing harsh weather conditions. Officials said on Wednesday however that they will not actively enforce the order.Matthew Crane, a 32-year-old Navy veteran who arrived three days ago, said the veterans joining the protest were “standing on the shoulders of Martin Luther King Jr and Gandhi” with their plans to shield protesters.“I bought a one-way ticket,” he told Reuters as he worked to build a wooden shelter at the main camp. “Hopefully we can shut this down before Christmas.”Meanwhile in West Fargo, North Dakota, several members of the North Dakota VeteransCoordinating Council, which represents five veterans organizations in the state, held a news conference to decry the involvement of veterans in a protest that has damaged property and asked veterans not to participate in the demonstration.“We agree that it is our constitutional right to assemble and to peacefully protest,” council President Russ Stabler told reporters at the West Fargo VFW Post 7564 building. “However, protests over the last 100-plus days in North Dakota have been less than peaceful.“Participating in this kind of assembly even as a peaceful bystander or participant will only mar the image of the North Dakota veterans and the veterans of our nation,” he added as he stood surrounded by about a dozen veterans from the region.North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple on Wednesday told reporters it was “probably not feasible” to reroute the pipeline, but he would try to rebuild a relationship with Standing Rock Sioux leaders.Dalrymple said state officials never contemplated forcibly removing protesters and his evacuation order was mainly due to concerns about inclement weather endangering people.The Standing Rock Sioux, in a statement on Wednesday, said that because “the Governor of North Dakota and Sheriff of Morton County are relative newcomers” to the land, “it is understandable they would be concerned about severe winter weather.”They said the camp has adequate shelter to handle the cold weather, adding that the Great Sioux Nation has survived “in this region for millennia without the concerns of state or county governments.”The temperature in Cannon Ball is expected to fall to 6 degrees Fahrenheit (-14 Celsius) by the middle of next week, according to Weather.com forecasts.Veterans Stand for Standing Rock, a contingent of more than 2,000 U.S. military veterans, intends to reach North Dakota by this weekend and form a human wall in front of police, protest organizers said on a Facebook page.The commissioner of the state’s Department of Veterans Affairs, who appeared at the West Fargo event, said he was worried about the involvement of individuals who have been in war situations.“We’re going to have veterans that we don’t know anything about coming to the state, war timeveterans possibly with PTSD and other issues,” Lonnie Wangen told Reuters.“They’re going to be standing on the other side of concertina fence looking at our law enforcement and our (National) Guard, many of whom have served in war zones also,” he added. “We don’t want to see veterans facing down veterans.”The 1,172-mile (1,885 km) pipeline project, owned by Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners LP, is mostly complete, except for a segment planned to run under Lake Oahe, a reservoir formed by a dam on the Missouri River.Protesters, who refer to themselves as “water protectors,” have been gearing up for the winter while they await the Army Corps decision on whether to allow Energy Transfer Partners to tunnel under the river. That decision has been delayed twice by the Army Corps.(Reporting by Terray Sylvester and Alicia Underlee Nelson; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli)"

The scheme was intended to punish the town’s mayor, a Democrat, for declining to endorse Christie’s reelection campaign.(Reporting by Ginger Gibson; Additional reporting by Emily Stephenson; Writing by Susan Heavey; Editing by Bernadette Baum)"
34,ARTS & CULTURE,How Art Helped An LGBTQ Woman Survive Incarceration,Priscilla Frank,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/on-the-inside-lgbtq-artists-prison_us_583de0f8e4b0c33c8e1280f2,"During her six years behind bars, drawing became Jennifer Mayo's identity.",2016-12-01,"Art work by another prisoner, Larry S, titled ""Always Without A Net.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/582c75fd150000db07b0d4dd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"“Art gone bad.” That’s how Jennifer Mayo described the circumstances that landed her in prison. The more technical terms are forgery and fraud. “I was misdirecting my energies and talents,” she joked. Mayo, now 38, was born in Corpus Christie, Texas, where she’s lived pretty much ever since. Her mother was a painter and ceramicist, so Mayo was in the vicinity of creative expression from a young age. Though she herself doodled and painted a bit, she didn’t start creating art in earnest until she was incarcerated. “In there it became a — I don’t know how to say it — a way to survive,” Mayo explained in an interview with The Huffington Post. The artist’s work is now on view as part of “On the Inside,” an exhibition comprised entirely of work by imprisoned LGBTQ artists. The show, curated by Tatiana von Furstenberg ― daughter of designer Diane von Furstenberg ― is currently being shown at Manhattan’s Abrons Arts Center.All of the artworks on view are made from materials accessible to prisoners ― in many cases, dull pencil on letter-sized paper; but in others, more unorthodox materials are used, like deodorant or an asthma inhaler filled with Kool-Aid. The images primarily depict people, including civil rights leaders, Rihanna, Jesus Christ, and a large selection of self-portraits, depicting the artists beyond the bars that physically confine them. “I wanted to engage with LGBTQ prisoners because I know that they feel forgotten, and have the least support outside,” Furstenberg told The New York Times. “Art basically is the highest form of soul expression. Through this art, people really get to express their highest self. And I wanted to do an exhibit to show the world that there are a lot of talented, complex human beings with no voices behind bars.” The exhibition was conceived of in collaboration with Black & Pink, a grassroots organization comprised entirely of formerly incarcerated individuals working to meet the needs of LGBTQ prisoners around the country.Jason Lydon, the national director and founder of Black & Pink, explained the importance of the exhibition in a panel that accompanied the show, as reported by Broadly. “They are creating things to inform our work and what we do on the outside, to ensure that not only this art moves us to feel solidarity but to fuel a call to action,” he said. “This creativity should not just be locked behind walls or in some shows. It needs to be free. It needs to escape back into the community.” For many artists in the exhibition, art offers an opportunity for artists to express their identities on their own terms. This gesture is especially crucial for transgender women who are forced to live out their sentences in male prisons, where they’re often subjected to horrific physical and psychological abuse. For many of these artists, art offered a rare chance for them to escape their physical realities.Mayo, however, had different motivations for delving deeper into her artistic craft after entering the prison system. “It’s a form of currency,” she said. “In a Texas prison, if you have no help from the outside and no money coming in, they supply you with two-inch bars of soap and a package of tooth powder. No shampoo, no deodorant. It’s rough to make it if you don’t have help. If you can make decent things, though, especially in the women’s prison, you can trade your talent for the things you need.”Behind bars, Mayo gained a following for her adroitly constructed crafts, which inmates would then gift to their loved ones and families. She was most proud of her moving greeting cards, which she created by cutting up cereal boxes with a broken down shaving razor, and gluing together parts with adhesive made from powdered milk. “I got a bit of a reputation for those, people would come from all over the unit to get them,” Mayo said. She later taught herself the basics of paper quilling, making small sculptures from hundreds of strips of paper, and figured out how to make shadow boxes from pieces of cardboard. On average, Mayo had a two-week waiting list for prisoners and officers eager to purchase her creations. “Without the art I don’t think I would have made it,” Mayo said. “It gave me an outlet, a way to consume my time. I was never sitting out in the rec. yard or watching TV. I was the one at the table in the back, drawing.”When drawing for herself, Mayo commonly opted for expressive depictions of women. When making art on the job, however, customers usually requested pop culture figures like Care Bears, Spider-Man or Dora the Explorer. Jail bars, hearts, and handcuffs were also common motifs. Mayo, who is a lesbian, added that she’d throw in a gay pride flag in the background when she sensed any sort of homophobia from her clientele. When Mayo entered the prison system, she explained, she was out as a lesbian. With an aesthetic she described as “masculine” and a gay pride tattoo on her leg, Mayo’s sexual preferences, she expressed, were clearly legible to the outside world. Being gay in a woman’s prison, however, yielded immense social capital, and shortly after being locked up, Mayo started receiving love notes from secret admirers written on toilet paper. Determined not to get involved in a relationship, and all the drama that predictably ensues, Mayo kept to herself, drawing in solitude and “taking the high road.”Mayo, who was released from prison after a six-year sentence, was one of the few exhibiting artists to visit “On the Inside” in person. The experience was bittersweet. “It was awesome to see, but very humbling to know that [the other artists] are still [in prison.] There were so many friends I made when I was there that will never leave the system.”Following her release, Mayo had difficulty finding work, and described her departure from prison life just as traumatic as her entrance into it. She got hired at a dollar store, and supplemented her income by selling artwork at local craft fairs. Although Mayo enjoys the occasional museum visit, she never seriously considered pursuing a traditional art career or education.“Someone once told me, ‘Going to art school would probably ruin you,’” she said. “I like to look at other people’s stuff. But for the most part I couldn’t really tell a van Gogh from a Monet. I don’t have a background in it.”These days, Mayo doesn’t draw quite as much. She is busy with what she jokingly called a “grown-up job.” Somewhat incongruously, Mayo attributed her exceptional work ethic to her time behind bars, where inmates were forced to work 45 hours per week without pay. “I will say that prison did make me a very good employee,” she pronounced with a dark sense of humor. “For six years I was never late to work, I never called in sick.”Aside from being featured in her first art exhibition, Mayo’s proudest recent accomplishment is purchasing a sailboat. Her ultimate dream, when parole is up, is to sail around the world. Of all the artists included in “On the Inside,” Mayo perhaps has the story with the happiest ending. Against the odds, she has managed to piece her life together. In part, she has her artistic talent to thank.“I think art has always been a part of who I am,” she said. “In times of stress it was extremely crucial to my identity. When I was incarcerated, I’m the one they went to. That’s who I was.”“On the Inside” runs until Dec. 18, 2016 at Abrons Arts Center in New York. See images from the exhibition below. "
35,MEDIA,Trump Supporters Inadvertently Show How Easily Misinformation Spreads Online,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cnn-trump-supporters-voters_us_58405e9ee4b09e21702d3bc0,"They cited ""the media"" and Facebook as the sources for baseless claims about illegal voting.",2016-12-01,CNN host Alisyn Camerota pushes back on the baseless claim that 3 million people voted illegally.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58405ee11a00000b03ccab99.png?cache=XGmJzParrd&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK ― In a revealing Thursday morning segment on CNN, Donald Trump supporters claimed that 3 million people voted illegally in the recent presidential election and that President Barack Obama had urged non-citizens to cast ballots. Both claims are false. The segment featured just five Trump supporters, but highlighted a broader concern about the spread of fake news during the election, with bogus pro-Trump stories widely shared on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter.Trump has helped fuel conspiracy theories himself, including baselessly claiming Sunday to his 16 million Twitter followers that “millions” of people voted illegally in the 2016 election. Some major news sites initially boosted that unsubstantiated claim, though most responsible news outlets clearly qualified that the allegation has no merit. Like the president-elect, some of Trump’s supporters share the view that widescale voter fraud took place, even if there isn’t evidence to back it up. Trump supporter Paula Johnson told CNN host Alisyn Camerota during the Thursday segment that 3 million undocumented immigrants ― or as she said, “illegals” ― voted in California.When pressed on where she got this information, Johnson said “the media” and suggested CNN might’ve been a source.CNN wasn’t a source for the 3 million claim, and no other major network has found evidence supporting it. But Johnson responded that it was “coming all across the media.”It’s true that legacy news organizations don’t have a monopoly on being “the media” these days, given that anyone can publish in real-time online and on social media.But the response is troubling if any “media” source, without providing facts, is given the same weight as established news organizations reporting that no evidence of fraud was found. Even if a story exists online that supports a person’s suspicions, that doesn’t make the story accurate.A similar situation occurred later during the discussion, when several members of the pro-Trump group said they heard Obama had urged people living in the United States illegally to vote. When asked for evidence, one guest responded that it was “on Facebook” and suggested the host to “Google it.”Camerota looked up the claim, which led her to a report about how Fox Business Network had deceptively edited a November interview Obama gave to actress Gina Rodriguez aimed at Latino millennial voters. The claim also spread on conservative sites and social media.But Snopes, which tracks internet rumors and misinformation, found that the full interview actually shows Obama urging American citizens who have undocumented family members to vote, rather than non-citizens. The Washington Post also debunked the claim. After the segment, Camerota discussed with co-anchor John Berman how Facebook was cited as a source for misinformation. “If you trace the tread back, there is always some nugget that gives them their false impression,” Camerota said after the interview. “But they didn’t trace back enough to see it had been discredited and debunked.”"

The letter, organized by the Union of Concerned Scientists, comes amid growing concern about what a Trump presidency will mean for combatting today’s environmental challenges, namely climate change. Trump and his fellow climate deniers have made it quite clear where they stand on the phenomenon and funding its continued study. Trump has dismissed climate change as “bullshit” and a Chinese “hoax,” and promised to pull the U.S. out of the historic Paris climate agreement. He has also said he would cut all federal spending on the issue, increase America’s production of coal, oil and natural gas, and do away with Obama administration regulations aimed at cutting emissions.In the weeks since the election, Trump has only added to scientists’ concerns by selecting climate change denier Myron Ebell and fossil fuel lobbyist Mike McKenna to lead transition work at the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Energy. Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and oil executive Harold Hamm are front-runners to head the Interior Department, and Trump’s senior adviser on space policy wants to eliminate NASA’s research into climate change.The letter, published Wednesday, features an impressive list of signatories, including David Baltimore, president emeritus of the California Institute of Technology; Eric Chivian, the founder and director of the Center for Health and the Global Environment at Harvard Medical School; and Wolfgang Ketterle, a German physicist and professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The scientists call on Trump and the 115th Congress to “adhere to high standards of scientific integrity and independence in responding to current and emerging public health and environmental threats.”In a news release on the letter, Lewis Branscomb, a physicist and professor at the University of California, San Diego, said: “Americans recognize that science is critical to improving our quality of life, and when science is ignored or politically corrupted, it’s the American people who suffer. Respect for science in policymaking should be a prerequisite for any Cabinet position.”The group also promised to keep a close eye on Trump ― and fight back if necessary. “We will continue to champion efforts that strengthen the role of science in policy making and stand ready to hold accountable any who might seek to undermine it,” the letter states."

Kids bully other students over their racial and ethnic backgrounds. Students as young as fourth grade use words like “pussy” and “slut.” This is what it is like to go to school in Donald Trump’s America, according to a new report from the Southern Poverty Law Center.The report, based on an unscientific survey of educators all over the country, details what 10,000 school employees saw in the days following Trump’s election. The dynamics relayed by the educators “are nothing short of a crisis and should be treated as such,” says the report. A vast majority of surveyed teachers report seeing increased rates of racially charged bullying, increased trauma and fear from targeted students, and less of a sense of community in diverse schools. Those who did not report these dynamics typically came from more racially homogeneous schools.The study follows a similar report from the organization released several months ago, which also provided anecdotal evidence of increased rates of bullying in school as a result of Trump’s campaign. Educators said the new dynamics are unlike anything they’d ever seen before. Ninety percent of educators who participated in the new survey said the president-elect has had a negative impact on their students. Eighty percent reported seeing heightened levels of anxiety from students who come from groups that have been targeted in Trump’s speeches, like immigrants, Muslims and students of color. Over 2,500 surveyed teachers said they have seen specific acts of bigotry since the election, like threats of violence, offensive graffiti and property damage. “White males have been overheard saying, ‘screw women’s rights, fag lover liberal, build the wall, lock her up.’ The rebel flag is draped on the truck of a popular student, and the p-word has been used very casually, citing Trump as the excuse,” said one high school teacher from Michigan cited in the report. Teachers reported seeing ugliness not typically seen after an election.“Words that I have not heard in the past — racist, bigot, pussy, slut — are now used by my fourth-graders,” relayed an elementary school teacher from Minnesota. Schools where most students come from minority groups reported fewer instances of overt bigotry. Still, teachers in these schools have seen signs of trauma in their students, who are nervous about what the next four years hold. “A kindergartener asked me ‘Why did the bully win?’” said an elementary school teacher from Arizona. “Other kids who have been awarded student of the month and considered great examples for our school hid in a classroom after school and drew pokemon fireballs attacking the man. This is a serious issue that we have not clearly addressed.”The report recommends that schools double down on anti-bullying strategies and work to support students who have been wounded by the election’s aftermath. “Every school should have a crisis plan to respond to hate and bias incidents,” says the report. ――Rebecca Klein covers the challenges faced in school discipline, school segregation and the achievement gap in K-12 education.

A mere $20.Working in their chemistry lab, the students synthesized 3.7 grams of pyrimethamine, the active ingredient in Daraprim. That yield is worth about $110,000 in the U.S., according to the BBC.Daraprim is an anti-parasitic medication used to treat malaria and other conditions involving compromised immune systems, such as AIDS. It is listed on the World Health Organization’s list of essential medicines.The boys, all 17, called their project “Breaking Good.” Under the guidance of Dr. Alice Williamson and Associate Professor Matthew Todd, they worked with the Open Source Malaria consortium, which allowed scientists anywhere in the world to view their data and offer feedback.“This Daraprim story has been ingrained in lots of people’s minds,” Dr. Williamson told CNN. “I thought ‘what if we can get these boys to show you can make it from cheap materials and that relatively inexperienced young scientists can make it?’”“We knew it was a good story and the boys have done a good job,” she went on. “It’s really captured people’s imaginations. They made a very pure sample of the active ingredient.”Turing Pharmaceuticals acquired the exclusive marketing rights to Daraprim in 2015 and quickly moved to raise the cost. Shkreli claimed that the decision was a strategy to make money from insurance companies and that the funds would be used to research better treatments.The patents for Daraprim have expired, but Turing still has exclusive rights to sell the drug, meaning the boys from Sydney can’t simply open up a shop in the U.S. and sell their own, affordable version.Shkreli ― who, whatever else you can say about him, isn’t afraid of bad P.R. ― belittled the students’ accomplishment on Twitter this week.Shkreli was arrested in December on securities fraud charges."

Lawmakers hailed the 99-0 vote as a critical step in ensuring that the U.S. would keep its ability to quickly reimpose sanctions if Iran violates the nuclear agreement reached last year. But the Obama administration and several sanctions experts say the extension has no practical effect and risks further straining ties with Tehran.The White House has expressed reservations about the utility and strategic wisdom of the legislation, but indicated the president will sign it into law.“I expect the President will sign the legislation when it reaches his desk, and the Secretary of State will retain the authority to continue to waive all of the relevant nuclear-related sanctions authorized by the legislation,” a White House official told The Huffington Post. The Iran Sanctions Act, passed in 1996, was set to expire at the end of the month. As part of the 2015 nuclear accord, the U.S. waived some of the sanctions on Iran that were authorized in the 1996 bill. Proponents of the extension argued that if they had let the bill expire, the U.S. would lose the ability to put sanctions back into place, making Iran less motivated to hold up its end of the deal. “If the sanctions architecture has expired, then we have no sanctions which we can snap back,” said Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), a hawkish Democrat who opposed the nuclear accord and has co-sponsored a different bill that would authorize new sanctions on Iran in addition to extending the 1996 law.The push for a clean extension of the 1996 sanctions, without any new provisions, was co-sponsored by 20 Senate Democrats, most of whom voted in favor of the nuclear deal last year. “Iran has to know that the threat of snapback sanctions is alive and well,” Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), a supporter of the nuclear agreement, said Thursday in explaining his vote to reauthorize the Iran Sanctions Act.Critics of the nuclear deal praised the outcome of Thursday’s vote. “The ISA is a critical foundation of the Iran sanctions architecture, keeps the snapback option in place and underscores the importance of bipartisan steadfastness in the face of Iran’s continued non-nuclear malign activities,” said Mark Dubowitz, the executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.But sanctions experts say that Menendez and his colleagues on Capitol Hill are vastly overstating the importance of renewing Iran Sanctions Act. Since it was passed in 1996, Congress and the White House have imposed a series of additional sanctions that have had a far greater impact on Iran’s economy. And even if the 1996 law expires, the president could unilaterally reimpose those sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).“The language of IEEPA give the President a virtual carte blanche in imposing restrictions on U.S. persons’ dealings with foreign individuals or entities,” wrote Samuel Cutler, a senior analyst at Horizon Client Access, an energy sector consulting firm. “Congressional action, rather than providing new authorities otherwise unavailable to the Executive, more often serves as a mandate for the administration to enact certain provisions,” he wrote. That makes lawmakers’ vote largely a symbolic display of toughness toward Iran. The actual effects of the extension are “pretty limited” said Erich Ferrari, a lawyer who specializes in sanctions law. But it could create the perception in Iran that the U.S. isn’t committed to holding up its end of the nuclear agreement.“The imposition or renewal of any sanctions are going to be spun by those parties to make it look as if the U.S. is imposing new or stricter sanctions,” Ferrari told HuffPost.While the sanctions extension won’t kill the nuclear deal, it will send a message to Tehran that many in Washington are looking for ways to unravel the accord, said Elizabeth Rosenberg, a former Treasury Department official who is now a senior fellow at the Center For New American Security.“Iranians understand that there are some who support ISA extension because they want to end the deal, and that certainly undermines their confidence in it and will to continue implementation,” Rosenberg wrote in an email. “It will undermine Iranian confidence, and European confidence in the American ability to stay committed to the deal, but it’s not a nail in the coffin.”With the election of Donald Trump, Tehran already has reason to question Washington’s commitment to the deal, known by the acronym JCPOA.“Trump’s ambiguous-to-hostile approach may make the Iranians more nervous and more inclined to express their concerns than they would have been,” said Richard Nephew, a former Iran sanctions coordinator at the State Department. “But even then I think Iran will play this smart: loud complaints, no action that contravenes JCPOA in order to keep the international mood against the US.”A bigger problem with the Iran Sanctions Act extension could come in 2024, when the U.S. will be obligated to terminate rather than temporarily suspend sanctions against Iran. If the extension gets signed into law, it will remain on the books until the end of 2026. “Assuming the deal lasts that long,” said Cutler, “we may be setting ourselves up for a legitimate fight between Congress and the President.”Secretary of State John Kerry made a last-minute plea to Senate Democrats on Wednesday to vote against extending the sanctions, but the White House has stopped short of threatening to veto the bill. “While we do not think that an extension of ISA is necessary, we do not believe that a clean extension would be a violation of the JCPOA,” said a senior administration official.The Iran Sanctions Act extension puts the White House in a difficult position. “I don’t think the White House believed that Congress would have the discipline to just pass a clean authorization,” Tyler Cullis, a policy associate at the National Iranian American Council, told HuffPost, referring to efforts by lawmakers like Menendez to combine the extension with the introduction of new sanctions. If Congress had voted to authorize additional sanctions, said Cullis, the White House would have had an easier time justifying a veto.This article has been updated to include comment from the White House."
40,POLITICS,The Senate Vote To Extend Iran Sanctions Is A Symbolic Move That Could Antagonize Tehran,Jessica Schulberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senate-vote-iran-sanctions-act-extension_us_58406bfce4b09e21702d5ace,Congress doesn't need to act for the U.S. to keep its ability to quickly snap sanctions back into place.,2016-12-01,"Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), one of the most outspoken critics of the Iran nuclear deal and one of few Democrats to vote against it, has led the push for additional sanctions against Iran.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5840703f1a00002500ccabd9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The Senate voted unanimously on Thursday to extend U.S. sanctions on Iran for 10 years. Lawmakers hailed the 99-0 vote as a critical step in ensuring that the U.S. would keep its ability to quickly reimpose sanctions if Iran violates the nuclear agreement reached last year. But the Obama administration and several sanctions experts say the extension has no practical effect and risks further straining ties with Tehran.The White House has expressed reservations about the utility and strategic wisdom of the legislation, but indicated the president will sign it into law.“I expect the President will sign the legislation when it reaches his desk, and the Secretary of State will retain the authority to continue to waive all of the relevant nuclear-related sanctions authorized by the legislation,” a White House official told The Huffington Post. The Iran Sanctions Act, passed in 1996, was set to expire at the end of the month. As part of the 2015 nuclear accord, the U.S. waived some of the sanctions on Iran that were authorized in the 1996 bill. Proponents of the extension argued that if they had let the bill expire, the U.S. would lose the ability to put sanctions back into place, making Iran less motivated to hold up its end of the deal. “If the sanctions architecture has expired, then we have no sanctions which we can snap back,” said Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), a hawkish Democrat who opposed the nuclear accord and has co-sponsored a different bill that would authorize new sanctions on Iran in addition to extending the 1996 law.The push for a clean extension of the 1996 sanctions, without any new provisions, was co-sponsored by 20 Senate Democrats, most of whom voted in favor of the nuclear deal last year. “Iran has to know that the threat of snapback sanctions is alive and well,” Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), a supporter of the nuclear agreement, said Thursday in explaining his vote to reauthorize the Iran Sanctions Act.Critics of the nuclear deal praised the outcome of Thursday’s vote. “The ISA is a critical foundation of the Iran sanctions architecture, keeps the snapback option in place and underscores the importance of bipartisan steadfastness in the face of Iran’s continued non-nuclear malign activities,” said Mark Dubowitz, the executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.But sanctions experts say that Menendez and his colleagues on Capitol Hill are vastly overstating the importance of renewing Iran Sanctions Act. Since it was passed in 1996, Congress and the White House have imposed a series of additional sanctions that have had a far greater impact on Iran’s economy. And even if the 1996 law expires, the president could unilaterally reimpose those sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).“The language of IEEPA give the President a virtual carte blanche in imposing restrictions on U.S. persons’ dealings with foreign individuals or entities,” wrote Samuel Cutler, a senior analyst at Horizon Client Access, an energy sector consulting firm. “Congressional action, rather than providing new authorities otherwise unavailable to the Executive, more often serves as a mandate for the administration to enact certain provisions,” he wrote. That makes lawmakers’ vote largely a symbolic display of toughness toward Iran. The actual effects of the extension are “pretty limited” said Erich Ferrari, a lawyer who specializes in sanctions law. But it could create the perception in Iran that the U.S. isn’t committed to holding up its end of the nuclear agreement.“The imposition or renewal of any sanctions are going to be spun by those parties to make it look as if the U.S. is imposing new or stricter sanctions,” Ferrari told HuffPost.While the sanctions extension won’t kill the nuclear deal, it will send a message to Tehran that many in Washington are looking for ways to unravel the accord, said Elizabeth Rosenberg, a former Treasury Department official who is now a senior fellow at the Center For New American Security.“Iranians understand that there are some who support ISA extension because they want to end the deal, and that certainly undermines their confidence in it and will to continue implementation,” Rosenberg wrote in an email. “It will undermine Iranian confidence, and European confidence in the American ability to stay committed to the deal, but it’s not a nail in the coffin.”With the election of Donald Trump, Tehran already has reason to question Washington’s commitment to the deal, known by the acronym JCPOA.“Trump’s ambiguous-to-hostile approach may make the Iranians more nervous and more inclined to express their concerns than they would have been,” said Richard Nephew, a former Iran sanctions coordinator at the State Department. “But even then I think Iran will play this smart: loud complaints, no action that contravenes JCPOA in order to keep the international mood against the US.”A bigger problem with the Iran Sanctions Act extension could come in 2024, when the U.S. will be obligated to terminate rather than temporarily suspend sanctions against Iran.

Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to head the Department of Justice, argued last year that the fight against climate change is a conspiracy to afflict poor people.In a November 2015 interview with a conservative Christian lobbying group’s in-house podcast, Sessions said investing trillions into clean energy does “almost nothing” to fight global warming and makes it harder for people in poor countries to afford electricity, according to audio obtained Thursday by The Huffington Post. The interview, which has since been removed from Family Research Council’s website, took place as world leaders gathered in Paris for the United Nations climate conference that yielded the historic climate agreement Trump now threatens to unravel. “Just think of a person out in a village,” Sessions told the show’s host, FRC President Tony Perkins. “Somebody once said a lifespan of a person in a society where electricity is readily available is twice that where it’s not.”“We don’t need to be driving up the cost and making it harder for poor people to have the sort of things we take for granted here,” he added.He appears to be suggesting that deals to support solar and wind energy infrastructure prevent developing countries from using cheap fossil fuels to produce affordable electricity, too. Ahead of the climate conference, President Barack Obama pledged to spend $3 billion over five years to support a U.N.-administered Green Climate Fund to help poorer countries build up renewable energy infrastructure and prepare for the impacts of climate change. The fund has been instrumental in convincing less-developed countries, which have been dependent on heavily polluting fuels like coal to grow their economies, to agree to cut back on greenhouse gases. “A huge part of this is that the United States is expected to send billions of dollars around the globe to fund energy projects in poorer countries,” Sessions said. “We are a generous nation. We do a lot to help the poor. We have missionaries and we have government programs that send out billions of dollars.”FRC did not immediately respond to questions about why the interview was removed from its website.The Republican-controlled Congress approved the first $500 million payment installment to the Green Climate Fund last December. But that amount is still expected to fall short of what emerging economies need to develop without reliance on fossil fuels ― and as the global poverty charity Oxfam put it, the Paris deal “failed to include meaningful mechanisms” to guarantee financial support for poorer countries adapting to global warming. Just 16 percent of the $100 billion a year pledged by rich countries in 2009 to help poorer countries deal with climate change has been paid, the report said.Poorer countries are often closer to the equator and disproportionately feel the effects of climate change. The number of impoverished people will grow from 702 million to 900 million by 2030, according to a 2015 World Bank report. When global warming factors in, that number increases to more than 1 billion, due largely to spikes in food prices as farmers struggle to adapt to climate change. But Sessions said that even the relatively little money the U.S. commits to addressing climate change abroad would be better spent supporting victims of terrorist attacks or infectious diseases.“It’s one thing to give money to people who survive attacks by ISIS, to be able to avoid malaria and tuberculosis,” Sessions said. “It’s another to spend hundreds of billions of dollars each year to try to fight this global warming that we’re not even sure exists.”Sessions, like many in the far-right wing of the Republican Party, has long denied scientific evidence of humans’ role in climate change. His routine votes against legislation to protect the environment earned him a paltry 4 percent last year on the League of Conservation Voters’ scorecard. In March 2015, while attempting to downplay the threat of global warming, he quizzed Environmental Protection Agency chief Gina McCarthy on her knowledge of cherry-picked weather and climate trends in what The Washington Post described as a “cringe-inducing … series of ‘gotchas.’” During the interview, Sessions repeated some of those claims, including that fewer major hurricanes have made landfall in the U.S. in recent years.“The predictions aren’t coming true,” he said, ignoring the increase in violent hurricanes and typhoons around the world. “The prediction was we’d have more hurricanes and more devastation.” That may have enhanced his appeal to the incoming administration. Trump has repeatedly called climate change “a hoax” and “a bunch of bunk” fabricated by the Chinese government to dupe the U.S. into making its manufacturing sector less competitive. He signaled his willingness to pull the country out of the Paris agreement, prompting threats of carbon tariffs on U.S. goods, and vowed to shred the Clean Power Plan, the Obama administration’s chief tool for reducing carbon emissions. Later in the FRC interview, Sessions suggested efforts to build clean energy projects in developing countries make it harder to expand their electricity grids. He further insisted that such projects, because they are attached to an international accord, are part of an attack on national sovereignty. “We as decent, good American people need to ask ourselves, should we burden people all over the world, and deny them electricity and cheap energy, in order to follow this theory that I do think, Tony, has a world government background to it?” Sessions, whose state is currently suffering a historic drought. “More and more world government that I think is not healthy for the United States.” A spokesperson for Sessions and the presidential transition team did not respond to a request for comment.

Local NBC affiliate WBIR compiled a list of those who have been reported missing.While a complete “soft search” of the affected areas is expected to be completed by late Friday, Waters acknowledged that more bodies could be found.“I want to make it very clear to everyone that this does not mean the search is complete,” he said.Questions arose at a press conference on Friday about the efficiency of the warning system, though most went unanswered.Notification of a mandatory evacuation was sent to cell phones in the affected area at 9:04 p.m. Monday, said John Mathews, emergency management director for Sevier County. Some people say they never received a notification, while others argue that the mandatory evacuation should have been sent earlier.“If people did not receive the message we sent out, then of course we’re dissatisfied,” Mathews said Friday, adding that power outages and cell tower blockages may have contributed to the absent notifications.Cassius Cash, superintendent of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, denied that anyone “dropped the ball” in allocating the appropriate resources to contain the original flames from Sunday. He said high winds that were forecast to arrive Monday afternoon came Sunday night, greatly expediting the spread of the wildfire. “We’re going to evaluate ... the responses and what went on, but this is not the appropriate time,” Waters said. “We’re working on getting folks help right now and getting people back into their properties.”Sevier County officials created an interactive map to show which structures had been destroyed or damaged by the fire (below). Green circles indicate the structure was affected by the fire, yellow mean minor damage, orange show major damage, and red mean the structure was destroyed.“This is the largest fire in the last 100 years in the state of Tennessee,” Gov. Bill Haslam (R) said at a press conference Tuesday evening. The wildfire burned over 17,000 acres and left more than 1,000 homes and businesses severely damaged or destroyed.Cash said Thursday that fire investigators have determined the forest fire component of the wildfire was “human-caused,” though no other details have been released.

47,WOMEN,Illinois Will Teach Hairdressers To Recognize Victims Of Domestic Violence,Melissa Jeltsen,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/illinois-will-teach-hairdressers-to-recognize-signs-of-domestic-violence_us_583f2717e4b09e21702c3122,All licensed beauty professionals will learn to spot signs of abuse.,2016-12-01,"Under a new law, hairdressers in Illinois are mandated to attend domestic violence and sexual assault training.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/583f42cf1800007b14310aed.jpeg?cache=AXx9ScL4pg&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Starting in 2017, hairdressers in Illinois will learn how to recognize signs of domestic violence in their clients, as well as where to refer them for support services.That’s thanks to new legislation, signed by Gov. Bruce Rauner (R) this past August. The law, which appears to be the first legislation of its kind in the nation, will require all licensed beauty professionals to undergo training on domestic violence and sexual assault.The law amends the Barber, Cosmetology, Esthetics, Hair Braiding, and Nail Technology Act, and mandates that anyone seeking licensure as a barber, cosmetologist, esthetician, hair braider, or nail technician take a one-hour class on domestic violence and sexual assault. Licensed beauty professionals will be required to take the hourlong training every two years to renew their license.The idea for the legislation came out of a steering committee at Chicago Says No More, a regional group seeking to raise awareness about domestic violence. Kristie Paskvan, founder of Chicago Says No More, told The Huffington Post that salon workers often develop close relationships with their clients, putting them in a unique position to offer help.“When someone is essentially grooming you, you build a relationship with them,” she said. “It’s a special relationship. People open up.”Experts at Chicago Says No More partnered with Cosmetologists Chicago to develop the draft curriculum, she said.According to the Centers for Disease Control, 1 in 4 women have been the victim of severe physical violence by an intimate partner. In 2014, more than 65,000 intimate violence incidents were reported to Illinois law enforcement. While beauty professionals will learn how to identify signs of domestic violence and how to connect clients to service providers, they won’t be expected to offer counseling and are not legally required to report abuse when it’s disclosed. The law specifies that they can’t be held civilly or criminally liable “for acting in good faith or failing to act on information obtained during the course of employment.”The goal is not to turn hairdressers into therapists, explained Vickie Smith, executive director of the Illinois Coalition Against Domestic Violence, but to equip them with resources they can share with their clients.“We don’t want to put people in a place where they feel like they have to respond or help beyond knowing where to refer,” she said.Smith told HuffPost that she was in favor of the law because, at its core, it gives survivors yet another way to get critical information about help that is available to them.“The more the public recognizes what domestic violence and sexual assault looks like, the more we are all likely to be able to say, ‘This is not your fault, there is help you can get, you don’t have to live like this,” she said. “It’s a form of prevention.” Paskvan agreed with Smith, and said she was hopeful the law will have a positive impact on domestic violence survivors across the state. “The training is not so that someone intervenes, or tells their client what to do ― it’s so they can learn to listen,” she said. “This can save lives.”Need help?

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) speaks in Glendale, California on Nov. 29, 2016. He blasted President-elect Donald Trump's deal to save Carrier jobs in a Thursday op-ed.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58402f531800009314310cf0.jpeg?cache=OZK93u6Udw&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is not impressed by President-elect Donald Trump’s deal with Carrier Corp. to keep roughly 1,000 jobs at its Indiana plant instead of sending them to Mexico as planned.The former Democratic presidential candidate ripped the apparent terms of the deal in an op-ed for The Washington Post. “Trump has endangered the jobs of workers who were previously safe in the United States,” Sanders wrote. “Why? Because he has signaled to every corporation in America that they can threaten to offshore jobs in exchange for business-friendly tax benefits and incentives.”Sanders’ entirely negative response is significant, as he has been a prominent voice on the issue and the deal has received a lot of mixed reviews so far. One important stakeholder, the United Steelworkers, offered tentative praise on Wednesday but said it needed to see more details. The union represents the company’s workers.Though the specific terms of the agreement haven’t yet been disclosed ― Trump is formally announcing the deal in an event at Carrier in Indianapolis later on Thursday ― Carrier said on Wednesday that tax breaks from the state of Indiana were part of it. “The incentives offered by the state were an important consideration,” the company said in a statement that also said it was looking forward to a more business-friendly climate under the coming Trump administration. Both Trump and Sanders repeatedly bashed Carrier during the campaign after Carrier’s parent company, United Technologies, announced in February that it would eliminate 2,100 jobs, including 1,400 at Carrier and 700 at another subsidiary called United Technologies Electronic Controls. Trump’s deal apparently saves less than half of the total jobs, the rest of which will still be going to Mexico. “It is not good enough to save some of these jobs,” Sanders wrote. “Trump made a promise that he would save all of these jobs, and we cannot rest until an ironclad contract is signed to ensure that all of these workers are able to continue working in Indiana without having their pay or benefits slashed.”Indeed, making a deal with one company does nothing to save jobs for the thousands of workers at other American companies still planning to shift production abroad. And as Sanders noted in the op-ed, Trump promised during the campaign to threaten Carrier with tariffs on products it would import into the United States as a way of dissuading them from offshoring the jobs ― rather than giving them tax relief as an incentive to stay.Speaking at a rally in Indianapolis in April where two Carrier workers were in attendance, Trump boasted of his plans to scare Carrier with the prospect of taxes on imports if it moved production to Mexico.“You’re gonna pay a damn tax when you leave this country and you think you’re going to sell product because we’re all so stupid,” Trump said.Trump made Carrier an example of America’s lost greatness, saying it showed how trade deals had hollowed out the American middle class by allowing companies to fire American workers in favor of cheaper foreign labor. Sanders had pushed Trump to use United Technologies’ revenue from federal contracts as leverage. “I call on Mr. Trump to make it clear to the CEO of United Technologies that if his firm wants to receive another defense contract from the taxpayers of this country, it must not move these plants to Mexico,” Sanders said in a Saturday press release.Though the deal has tax breaks, an Indiana official who has been briefed on its terms said the threat of losing federal contracts may have been more significant. John Mutz, a member of the Indiana Economic Development Corp., a state agency that helps attract business investment, told the Indiana Business Journal that the threat of losing a “favorable relationship with federal contractors” was a bigger factor. Big business has long used the threat of departure to cow state and local governments into giving them favors. Sports teams, which often auction themselves to the city willing to build the most extravagant stadium for them, are only the most notorious example. These companies have a long history of soliciting budget-busting tax breaks or investments from authorities only to fly the coop once the incentives expire or they find a more attractive offer elsewhere. It rapidly devolves into a race to the bottom. Still, Sanders is not alone in panning the agreement as a uniquely dangerous corporate giveaway. Some economists believe it creates a new precedent for companies considering offshoring to shake down the federal government as well.Sanders’ Saturday statement had given encouragement to Carrier workers who were hoping Trump would keep his promise.“Now that he’s even getting involved it’s becoming a bipartisan issue,” Paul Roell, who has worked for Carrier for 17 years, told HuffPost earlier this week. “That’s kinda gonna give us more leverage.”"
49,POLITICS,"Sorry, There's No Reason To Think Ivanka Trump Will Be Our Climate Change Champion",Lydia O'Connor,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ivanka-trump-climate-change_us_5840609ee4b09e21702d3fda,Reporting otherwise is irresponsible.,2016-12-01,"Ivanka Trump speaks at the opening of her father's golf course in Turnberry, Scotland, Britain June 24, 2016.

Her thoughts on climate change are never mentioned again in the nearly 2,000-word piece, which mainly focuses on her appeal to liberal voters and potential role in her father’s administration. There is no clear indication whether she intends to “speak out” for or against the energy policies scientists unanimously agree are necessary to combat climate change, nor is it clear whether she accepts that climate change is caused by human activity, namely the coal industry Trump has vowed to rescue. That sound bite should not give Americans reason to wonder ― as Politico’s question-mark headline presumably aims to do ― whether Ivanka Trump will be America’s climate change champion. “She’s not even in the final stages of exploring how to speak out,” David Kinzer wrote on the Jewish political blog JPUpdates. “Presumably, whenever she does reach that final stage, she will come to the conclusion that actually speaking about climate change would be a very good way to speak out about it ... Stories about her supposed liberal interests just serve to keep liberals purchasing her pumps.”Politico’s piece led to some interesting interpretations by other outlets:“Report: Ivanka Trump wants to fight climate change as first daughter,” Glenn Beck’s conservative outlet The Blaze proclaimed in its headline.“No ‘hoax’ for Ivanka: Future first daughter plans to make combating climate change part of her platform,” the Daily Mail’s headline read. “Politico: Ivanka Warms Up to Climate Change,” Newsmax ran with. “Politico reported Thursday that Ivanka Trump is exploring ways to use her new spotlight and position to advocate for the fight against global warming,” The Hill wrote in its story, despite no mention of a “fight” in the Politico feature.There is no evidence in the Politico story nor in any of her past comments that she’ll be a voice of reason on climate change during the Trump administration. A Google search for her public comments on the issue turns up no results.What we do know is she’s a fierce advocate for her father, whose thoughts on climate change are clear: He picked prominent climate change denier Myron Ebell to lead the transition at the Environmental Protection Agency, promised to undo elements of President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan in his first 100 days, vowed on the campaign trail to withdraw from the 2015 Paris Agreement and called climate change a hoax “created by and for the Chinese” in 2012. The spin on the Politico source’s comments is especially alarming considering the same thing happened with comments the president-elect made about climate change in a sit-down with New York Times staffers just last week, which Grist expertly called out. A review of the transcript, reporter Rebecca Leber found, showed that he had not changed his tune on climate change at all, despite countless headlines celebrating the contrary. Regardless, some environmental activists hold out hope that the president-elect’s children could influence their father on climate change. On the same day the Politico piece came out, the League of Conservation Voters released an open letter to Ivanka Trump and her brothers Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, urging them to make sure their father “steps up to the mark” and addresses global warming concerns. We don’t know with absolute certainty what Ivanka Trump thinks about climate change, and she may prove us completely wrong. For the sake of the planet, we hope she does. "

They’re not really facts,” Trump surrogate Scottie Nell Hughes said on “The Diane Rehm Show” on NPR. “It’s kind of like looking at ratings or looking at a glass of half-full water. Everybody has a way of interpreting them to be the truth or not true. There’s no such thing, unfortunately, anymore as facts.”Hughes, a political commentator and former talk radio producer, was responding to criticism of Trump’s recent claim that millions of people voted illegally in November’s presidential election. Trump provided no evidence to support this assertion, and there’s no sign that any such evidence actually exists.Hughes also denounced journalists for critically reporting on Trump’s lies, saying that the president-elect likes social media because it allows him to “accurately” communicate with voters.Her comments left the show’s other guests ― a group of journalists ― stunned.“First, I got to pick my jaw up off the floor here,” Politico’s Glenn Thrush told Hughes. “Facts are facts. I’m sorry you don’t like the facts.”The Atlantic’s James Fallows, who was also a guest on the show, later wrote that the comment left the rest of the guests “staring at one another in puzzlement.”“This is the world we are now dealing with,” Fallows wrote.There are a head-spinning number of lies and conspiracy theories that Trump has falsely presented as fact, including the idea that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese and the widely debunked claim that vaccines are directly linked to autism in children."

He returned in 2008.“Having him step down as CEO raised the anxiety level,” said Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh, who said that Schultz is the heart and soul of the brand, its entrepreneurial leader and its savior.“We’re in a much better position on every level,” said Schultz, who returned for his second stint as CEO in the depths of the “Great Recession,” when Starbucks’ stock was trading below $10. Late last year, it hit an all-time high above $60. Schultz has put Starbucks in the national spotlight, asking customers not to bring guns into stores and urging conversations on race relations.Many of the campaigns have generated controversy, but analysts have not seen a hit to financial results and the efforts have raised the profile of the coffee company and cemented Schultz’s status as a national figure.“The idea that he’s replaceable, I think that’s erroneous,” said Bill Smead, CEO of Smead Capital Management in Seattle, which owns Starbucks shares. He compared the change to the retirement of long-time McDonald’s Corp CEO Ray Kroc, who turned a handful of hamburger stands into the world’s biggest restaurant company.The announcement on Thursday also came as investors worry about the restaurant industry’s stubborn traffic declines. Starbucks has held up better than most, but it has not been immune.Johnson is a former technology executive who became president and chief operating officer at Starbucks in March 2015.Johnson has been on the Starbucks board since 2009 but most of his career was in the technology industry. He was the chief executive of Juniper Networks Inc from September 2008 to January 2014 and prior to that held several senior positions at Microsoft Corp.On a conference call after the announcement, analysts pressed the company on timing and whether, with Schultz stepping aside, senior management still had the “merchant gene.”“Not having retail experience could be a problem over time,” said Howard Penney, an analyst at Hedgeye Risk Management.“I’m not leaving the company and I’m here every day,” said Schultz, whose office is connected to Johnson’s.Traffic at established Starbucks cafes fell in the last quarter, which Johnson has attributed to a change in the company’s loyalty program, and Starbucks forecast a mid-single-digit rise in 2017 same-store sales.The company dismissed speculation that Schultz could be preparing for a new career in politics.“He has no plans to run for political office, as he has said many times, and will remain with the company as Starbucks executive chairman, focusing on premium coffee,” a spokeswoman said.(Reporting by Gayathree Ganesan and Siddharth Cavale in Bengaluru; additional writing by Peter Henderson; Editing by Bill Rigby and Jonathan Oatis)"

The Arctic ― and, for completely unrelated reasons, the Antarctic ― just closed out November with less ice than any other year in history.But the real cause for alarm isn’t last month’s warming blip in the Arctic that temporarily stalled ice growth, an anomaly that happens from time to time. Nor is it the concurrent loss of ice in the Antarctic ― since, to the best of our knowledge, the behavior of sea ice in one hemisphere has nothing to do with the behavior of sea ice in the other.The scariest part of all this is the long-term warming trend it follows.“The 10 lowest years [of Arctic sea ice] have all occurred in the last 10 years,” said Julienne Stroeve, a senior research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center.Here’s why that matters, in the context of November’s stall in Arctic sea ice growth.Typically, after a warm summer, the Arctic will cool down as it plunges into the darkness of winter. Sea ice will regrow, reflecting sunlight and shielding the waters below from further warming.In mid-November of this year, unseasonably warm temperatures ― upward of 30 degrees Fahrenheit higher than normal ― occurred in the Arctic, chasing away the cooler air that normally settles in the region: So instead of growing rapidly, as it normally does this time of year, the Arctic ice actually spent a couple of days last month shrinking ― as this graph, which shows the extent of sea ice on Nov. 19 (using data from JAXA), illustrates:On Nov. 20, at the height of that odd melt, there were 3.33 million square miles of ice in the Arctic ― nearly 400,000 fewer square miles than there’d been on the same day in 2012, the previous record low year, and approximately 880,000 fewer square miles than the average amount of ice from 1981 to 2010.Here’s a satellite view of the ice growth from Sept. 19 to Nov. 19. For comparison, the orange and yellow lines represent the average ice extents in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s:Alarming as last month’s downward tick seems, however, it is only a tick. “Stalls in ice growth are common,” said Stroeve, and the recent blip in the Arctic is “not necessarily unusual.”More worrisome is the decades-long trend of ice retreating more and more every year.This pattern means that at the start of every summer, not only does the Arctic have less ice coverage than the previous year, but the ice itself is thinner and more easily melted. This leads to a vicious cycle, with even thinner, more easily melted ice the following year.“Slow ice growth in winter means that the ice will not be able to grow as thick as it normally does in winter. We saw this last winter with the warmest winter yet recorded during the satellite record in the Arctic,” Stroeve said. “A thin ice of course more easily melts out in summer, so it’s not a good start to the melt season next year. Thinning ice is certainly part of the reason why summer ice conditions have not recovered.”If the long-term melting trend continues, the Arctic Ocean will likely see ice-free summers by the middle of this century, Stroeve said.The direction of that trend, independent of freak weather events like we saw in November, should worry us more than anything else. It also increases the need for world leaders, including President-elect Donald Trump, a climate-change denier, to maintain existing commitments to global climate change accords.Here’s an animation of Arctic ice thickness from 1979 to the present. Note the sharply decreasing amounts of deeper, older ice beginning around the year 2000:“We are all ice-dependent species, and the shrinking sea ice cover removes that reflective blanket that helps to keep our planet cooler than it otherwise would be,” Stroeve said. “Thus, the loss of the Arctic sea ice amplifies global warming.”The news isn’t any better in the Antarctic, where sea ice is coincidentally also at an all-time low.While the Arctic is an ocean surrounded by land, the Antarctic is just the opposite ― a continent surrounded by water. As a result, notes NASA, sea ice behaves very differently in the two environments, and there’s not much that one can tell us about the other.The sharp decline in Antarctic ice is especially puzzling, since it actually hit record highs in 2013 and 2014.“Why Antarctic extent is also very low right now is something we are still puzzling over,” Mark Serreze, director of the NSIDC, told The Washington Post. “However, there’s really no connection between the extreme mutual anomalies in the two hemispheres that we are aware of. We have to wait and see what happens. Having said this, things are getting weird in the polar regions.”"

Tom Udall (D-N.M.) is calling on President Barack Obama to condemn the recent violence against Dakota Access Pipeline protesters.“I write to urge your renewed personal attention to the pressing issues surrounding the Dakota Access Pipeline,” he wrote in a letter to Obama Wednesday. “There have been far too many dangerous violent confrontations between protestors and state and local law enforcement, with serious injuries resulting.”The letter comes nearly three months after the Obama administration paused construction on the controversial pipeline over water safety concerns that the Standing Rock Sioux and other tribes raised. While some consider pipelines to be one of the most efficient ways to shuttle oil across regions, serous incidents are actually quite common. In 2015 alone, there were a record 132 significant spills, according to CNN.The Dakota Access Pipeline would stretch roughly 1,200 miles from North Dakota to Illinois and transport around 470,000 gallons of crude oil each day, according to the Energy Transfer Partners website. Demonstrations have grown sharply since construction work stopped. While most of the protests have been peaceful, there have been some violent clashes with law enforcement that have resulted in injuries.Udall called the police at Standing Rock “overly militarized.” Their use of rubber bullets and water cannons appears to “violate civil rights,” he added.The Standing Rock Sioux asked the Department of Justice to investigate potential civil rights violations by law enforcement in October, but the department has not taken action to look into this request so far. Though Republicans have asked Obama as recently as Wednesday to allow pipeline construction to continue, opponents are refusing to leave.“Forcible removal of people from federal land where they have been allowed to camp, along with food blockades, would be serious mistakes,” Udall warned. Udall is set to to become vice chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee in the next Congress. He worries the pipeline dispute could “negatively impact federal-Tribal relations” if a “respectful resolution” is not decided, according to the letter.Sen. John Hoeven (R-ND) said Wednesday that overall construction on the pipeline is 86 percent completed, but Udall’s letter pressed Obama to think carefully about the tribe’s concerns with the pipeline.“Tribal rights and interests have taken a back seat for far too long in our nation,” he said. “I trust that you are considering every available option, including altering the pipeline route, to respond to the Standing Rock Sioux’s concerns.”This article has been amended to more accurately paraphrase Udall’s letter."

57,POLITICS,The One House Republican Who Can't Stop Criticizing Donald Trump,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/justin-amash-donald-trump_us_58406d7ae4b017f37fe35a9e,Principle isn't dead everywhere.,2016-12-01,Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) listens during a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58408def1800009314310e85.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Within the Republican rat race to shift core principles and cozy up to the Trump administration, there’s one Republican in the House who seems totally uninterested in running the maze.When Donald Trump proposed a year of jail or loss of citizenship for burning the flag, this congressman said no president should be allowed to “burn the First Amendment.”When Trump said only the media thinks his potential conflicts of interest are “a big deal,” he quote tweeted the president-elect to say that it was indeed a big deal, affixing Trump’s hashtag, #draintheswamp.And when Trump indicated he would nominate Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) to be attorney general, he said he was “deeply concerned” by the pick.Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) says it’s not difficult for him to criticize Trump. He’s just being consistent.“I’m not here to represent a particular political party; I’m here to represent all of my constituents and to follow the Constitution,” Amash told The Huffington Post earlier this week.Amash, a 36-year-old lawyer entering his fourth term in Congress, has quite a bit of experience in breaking with his party. If there’s a bill that passes on the House floor with one member in opposition, there’s a good chance it’s Amash. He’s perhaps the most hated Republican in some orbits of the GOP conference ― Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) once called Amash “Al Qaeda’s best friend in Congress” ― just as he’s perhaps the most respected lawmaker in Libertarian circles. He’s partnered with Democrats to lead the charge against detention at Guantanamo Bay and the National Security Agency’s blanket collection of telephone metadata, and he’s been an outspoken critic of Trump from the very beginning to the very end, when he wrote in Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) on his ballot.At no point in the 2016 election did Amash ever flirt with supporting Trump ― and not because he thought the real estate mogul couldn’t win. He, in fact, said he wouldn’t support Trump because he feared he could win.Take, for instance, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). Ryan ― a pro-trade, pro-immigration reform, anti-cronyism Republican ― has gone out of his way to praise Trump whenever he can. On Thursday, Ryan applauded a deal with Carrier that would offer the company tax breaks in exchange for not moving an Indiana furnace plant to Mexico.“I think it’s pretty darn good that people are keeping their jobs in Indiana instead of going to Mexico,” Ryan said, after years of crying out that the government “shouldn’t be in the business of picking winners and losers.”Amash had a different take.Again, Amash believes he’s just being consistent. “I ran on a set of principles, and it doesn’t really matter which party is in charge or who the president is; I’m going to stick by my principles,” he told HuffPost.He seems unworried by a potential backlash from standing up to Trump. In his congressional district, Amash noted, Mitt Romney did better than Trump ― and Amash did better than all of them. As for Trump going after him, Amash is characteristically unflinching. “Let’s see it happen,” he said. “It’s up to him how he takes it. I’m going to stand by my beliefs and stand up for my constituents and stand up for the Constitution.”Amash says his quote tweets criticizing Trump aren’t personal ― “these are critiques on policy” ― and that he’ll continue calling out his disagreements.One of the biggest areas of discord is national security and surveillance. Trump has taken a number of authoritarian positions, going as far as advocating torture and calling for a Muslim registry. And as much as Trump has tried to bring in every corner of the Republican Party into his transition team, one branch of the GOP has systematically been excluded: Libertarians.Nunes ― the member who tied Amash to Al Qaeda ― serves on Trump’s transition national security team, as does another former intelligence committee chairman: Rep. Pete Hoekstra (R-Mich.), who was instrumental in trying to unseat Amash during a heated 2014 primary. (Amash delivered a scathing victory speech that year where he called Hoekstra a disgrace. “I’m glad we could hand you one more loss before you fade into total obscurity and irrelevance,” he said.)Yet another former intelligence chairman who shares bad blood with Amash, former Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.), was also on Trump’s national security transition team, before internal power struggles cost him his spot.Which is all to say it would be difficult to find three Republicans more ideologically split with Amash on national security and surveillance than the last three Republican chairmen of the intelligence committee. Asked if it was alarming that those were the types of people Trump wanted picking a national security team, Amash was Amash.“Those names are consistent with the positions he laid out during the campaign. It’s not alarming in that sense,” he said. Trump “believes strongly in the surveillance state,” Amash noted, saying those names were “not inconsistent with what he said he would do.”As for other Trump team selections, Amash has repeatedly expressed concern over Sessions becoming attorney general, citing his Senate voting record on civil rights and surveillance issues.“The attorney general has a lot of independent authority, so it’s a position we need to be really careful about,” Amash said.On Twitter (apparently the preferred method of communication for both Amash and Trump), the congressman said Sessions supports indefinite detention, mass surveillance, and civil asset forfeiture.“If a Dem nominee held these views, [Republicans] would be screaming for Senate to reject him. We should be consistent with our constitutional concerns,” he said.Regarding Trump’s financial conflicts of interest, Amash noted that many Republicans were just sort of waiting to see what Trump does. But he also indicated that the president-elect’s current plans of action don’t seem adequate.“He has to explain better how he’s handling conflicts of interest,” Amash said. “It’s not enough to say, ‘I’m the president, the president can’t have conflicts of interest.’”Of course, as comfortable as Amash seems criticizing Trump, there are some topics where he just won’t go.When asked about the prospect of impeaching Trump, should he not solve his conflicts of interest or increase the surveillance that he already believes is unlawful, the Michigan Republican, who already chooses his words carefully, spent some extra time coming up with a response.He thought about what he wanted to say, pausing for a few moments over and over again, and then, three times, said: “I’m not going there.”"

After several days of drinking rum and Cokes from breakfast to midnight, and lounging about in the most beautiful turquoise water anywhere outside of Bora Bora and Fiji, we got an itch to do what Canadians traveling to Cuba rarely do—leave the resort.We rented a tiny car directly from our concierge, Ermano, who told us that his name means Noble Soldier. It might even have been his car, but we didn’t ask.When Ermano handed us the keys, he said with a smile and a slight accent, “There is a curfew for tourists to return back to the property. I will get in trouble. Just be back by sunset and everything will be okay. Okay?”With that, and without understanding anything about the country, apart from the friendly service we had received in the buffet line, we set out to squeeze seven hours of daylight in Fidel’s Cuba.After miles of grass and countryside and wild cows, many of them pure white, we rolled up to our first Cuban town and soon an alternate reality showed itself.The homes were packed tightly together, rowing the street. They were made of concrete blocks, cheerfully painted in blue or yellow or lavender. Each was a simple one-room structure with a rudimentary opening for an entrance. There were no doors and we could see inside: dirt floors and mismatched beds.Every dwelling had a knee-high fence around twenty feet squared of front lawn where women were busy cooking on rusty grills on open fire pits. And although it wasn’t under roof, I understood that this was the kitchen of the house.An old man slept in the gutter of the road. A dusty dog slept beside him. Both were baked brown in the afternoon heat. Children ran outside, squealing and playing, joyfully unaware of a bigger world that they would never know.We parked Ermano’s car and wandered into a bar, drawn in by the sound of slow plucking on a Spanish guitar and a man singing something that sounded like both a romance and a great sorrow at the same time.It was a genuine saloon, with swinging half-doors and all, and it was dark enough to dim what our rose colored glasses could no longer. We took two stools and ordered rum, straight up.The bartender was a happy oldtimer and introduced himself as Johnny. He asked us where we were from and where we were staying and how we liked Cuba. And we asked him about his family and his job, and learned that he played the drums at night in another club down the street.“My wife Analena is a housekeeper there at your hotel, a maid.” He leaned over the bar towards us and lowered his voice, “Sometimes she brings home soap from that hotel. Not the new soap. The pieces that are left once the guests leave. You know, our government gives us soap and shampoo and things like that. Free. But, it’s just one per month for each family. The soap Analena brings home is good.”I thought about how Canadian travelers to Cuba are in the habit of purposefully leaving clothes behind for the maids. In fact, I had packed with it in mind, choosing dresses and products that I didn’t need, knowing that’s what we do for people who don’t have much, but not fully understanding why.We bought Johnny a shot and he knocked it back quickly and put the glass out of sight. He was pleased to tell us much about the Cuban culture and society and lifestyle. The hours skipped by with ease, as if dancing to the elegant beats and percussion.Then, we noticed the light from outside begin to turn pink and blush with the sun setting. We knew our time was narrowing, so we asked him one final line, “What do you think about Fidel Castro?”Johnny’s eyes said much, but with his lips he only whispered this, “Cuban people are, by nature, full of life and love. Fidel fears many things, and when you fear so much, you cannot love at the same time. But he doesn’t have a fear of death. No, because he can control the death of many. And he does. What he fears the most is the people themselves. Fidel has a fear of life.”Visit www.1penelope.com"

President-elect Trump, busily forming his national security team, has been silent thus far on the Afghan challenges. Yet the Afghanistan war is one of the longest American combats and nation building endeavors in history. Over 1800 Americans lost their lives, thousands wounded and billions of dollars spent since 2001. Despite the staggering investment in blood and treasure, Afghanistan cannot sustain herself politically, economically and more importantly security wise. Taliban are on the offensive and ISIS has established a foothold in eastern Afghanistan. Pakistan continues to support the Taliban against Afghanistan and the U.S. interests in the region. All this in the backdrop of a dysfunctional Afghan government could complicate matters for the incoming Trump administration.Afghan National Unity Government is Divided and SputteringIt has been two years since Afghan president Ashraf Ghani and Afghan chief executive Abdullah Abdullah have been in power. Contrary to the rosy pictures painted at the time, progress on many fronts has been dismal at best. The most important failure of the National Unity Government (NUG) has been a lack of progress in the crucial areas of electoral reform and constitutional changes. These reforms are necessary for the legitimacy of the NUG amid the deteriorating security situation, high unemployment, rampant institutional corruption and other problems. The country is divided along ethnic and tribal faults more than ever. To understand the root cause of the government of “national disunity,” it is helpful to recap what transpired at its formation in 2014.Mr. Ghani is a Pashtun, the largest ethnic group in Afghanistan. He had to ally himself with Rasheed Dostom, a notorious Uzbek warlord from the north, to compensate for a shortfall of Pashtun votes. If Afghanistan is divided along ethnic and tribal fault lines and if the Pashtuns are the largest group, why did Ashraf Ghani need Dostom’s support? The reason is that many Pashtuns believe that they have been marginalized and that the international community’s intervention in Afghanistan conspired with the Northern Alliance against them. The Taliban are mostly Pashtuns. The Northern Alliance is mostly Tajik, but at times is in an uneasy coalition with Uzbeks and Hazaras as well. As a result, few Pashtuns participate in the electoral process, which is also grossly flawed. The presidential election of 2014 was mired by accusations of fraud, with both Ghani and Abdullah pointing fingers at each other. Abdullah went so far as to threaten the stability of the government. To prevent a potentially serious situation the U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry repeatedly intervened to bring the warring parties together. The result was the formation of the so-called Government of Unity which recognized Mr. Ghani as the president and appointed Mr. Abdullah as the chief executive, a position which does not exist in the country’s constitution.The discord between chief executive Abdullah and his governing partner became so ugly that last summer Abdullah called Ghani “unfit” for office. But Abdullah toned down his public criticism of Ghani ahead of a crucial conference which took place in Brussels on October 4, 2016. NUG had to convince the donor countries that their continued investment in Afghanistan will be spent wisely. NUG presented a list of accomplishments on various fronts, but nothing relative to electoral reforms and constitutional change to strengthen the institution of the unity government. Abdullah has pledged that the NUG will continue for the entire five-year term of Ghani’s presidency.The Afghan parliament exacerbated the disunity by recently dismissing a number of ministers in a vote of no confidence. It included the foreign minister, Sallahudin Rabbani, who has considerable political clout among the Northern Alliance group. The Afghan president Ghani ignored the parliament’s decision and the sacked ministers are still on the job.Afghan National Security Forces Still Not Up to SnuffTaliban advances in 2016 have shown that the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF), which includes the police as well as the army, is incapable of holding back Taliban attacks without the support of NATO/US forces. The all-volunteer Afghan National Army (ANA) numbers about 170,000 troops, according to the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction’s latest report. Ethnically, the majority of the ANA is made up of ethnic groups such as Tajiks and other groups from the north. The Pashtuns, which constitute the largest ethnic group in Afghanistan, have little representation. Therefore, the ANA is essentially an ethno-tribal army and not a national army like the one that Afghanistan once fielded up until the late 1970s. The Afghan army was then an all conscript army drafted from every corner of the country and consisted of all tribes and ethnic groups (Pashtuns, Tajiks, Hazaras, Uzbeks, Turkmans et al.). ANSF is not able to reverse the Taliban’s gains with the current US support. To recapture territory, US/NATO will have to substantially increase its direct combat support to ANSF.Expanding the U.S.’s role in Afghanistan in terms of more boots on the ground and more taxpayers’ money will be a major dilemma for the Trump administration. During the campaign, Mr. Trump indicated a lack of desire for nation building. He wants the U.S. allies to fend for themselves and pay the US for protecting them. We don’t yet know what Mr. Trump specifically has in mind about Afghanistan. Regionally, the tug of war between Pakistan and India continues unabated, negatively affecting the Afghan situation. Mr. Trump is also against the U.S. rapprochement with Iran. A unilateral abrogation of the recent Iranian nuclear deal could have adverse consequences for the U.S. and Afghanistan. Given these complexities, Afghan challenges may trump Trump’s other foreign policy problems."

Despite my disappointment, the painful election results have led me to fall in love with my wife and our nation all over again.Let me explain: We wept as the results came in on election night and retreated to our own ways of coping. I sulked and my wife Beata went on a shopping spree. She warned me Thursday morning that she had indulged in some “binge shopping” to deal with her frustration, which was not like her. A couple days later, I got home from my job as a high school social studies teacher to find boxes of books for our young children (8 and 4) about multiculturalism, world religions and kindness. One book was titled, “If I were President” with a young girl featured on the cover.This was the shopping binge?Over the course of the next week, more books arrived and the conversations at our dinner table turned to messages of hope and helping others.A child alone on the playground? Invite him to play in your game.A clash of ideas in school? Listen and try to understand, without fighting to be right.If someone is struggling, offer to help.My wife decided in her despair that if the world needed to be made better, we should start with our own family and branch out. While I remained in a fog, Beata took action. With grace, she inspired me to continue my advocacy for American values in my classroom. Beata helped me hang on to hope that with a renewed purpose, we could overcome the terrible setback of a Trump victory.These books and our conversations at home took a profound turn when our son asked us, “Why did people make a bully the president?” and “Can he (Trump) start now so the four years will get done faster?” When our son asked, “Will Trump’s wall keep us from meeting our cousins who live in Iran?” it hit me just how closely my eight-year-old had been paying attention to the hateful tone of Trump’s campaign. Family Lessons: Patriotism, dreams and standing up to hateBeata is the daughter of Iranian immigrants. Her parents worked in the fast food industry in the 1970’s and 80’s as they climbed onto the first rung of opportunity in the United States. They alternated shifts so they could advance their education and raise their family.To me, a white male from rural Michigan, my wife’s parents epitomize the American Dream I never had to think about growing up. With hard work, incredible sacrifice and an unwavering commitment to each other they made a life that we are grateful for every day. Beata and her sister are strong, loving and open-minded. Beata has a successful career and my children are blessed with a wonderful mother.My wife’s parents have both earned advanced degrees and they have achieved professional success. More importantly, they share the beauty of their culture, help others and embrace people of all backgrounds. My Persian family is remarkably loving and kind so naturally it hit a little closer to home when Trump promoted the idea of a “watch list” for Americans from Muslim nations. When Trump spoke with brazen contempt of immigrants and fueled hateful rhetoric toward the various groups he views as a threat, the sting was felt in our home. Each cabinet appointment or ridiculous tweet serves as a reminder that our friends and neighbors were negligent.This election has reminded me that the fight for good starts in our homes and our communities. My wife Beata moved to Southeast Michigan in 2004, a far cry from Portland, Oregon where she grew up. At that time she was a journalist in Flint and we were just beginning our life together. Beata was living a dream afforded by the First Amendment that her father never had the luxury of enjoying in Iran. Her father, once jailed for political expression in his homeland, has always been Beata’s biggest cheerleader. He has taught me first-hand about a father’s devotion to family.I have been a teacher for sixteen years and I use my platform to help students learn American values like equality, the common good and diversity. Strong women influence my teaching and make me a better man. My mother embraces diversity and she has shown me what it means to help others. She is a resilient woman and there’s no doubt that I was attracted to my wife because of the lessons from my mom.Lessons passed on live for a long time. I remind my high school students that when hate and division are employed as a political strategy to promote “otherness” that it is not enough to simply understand that it is wrong. It is our civic duty to push back against hate. Speak out. Be heard. Hillary Clinton, Khizr Khan and Michelle Obama modeled how to stand up to hate.That discomfort felt in the pit of your gut when you confront bigotry or sexism is a sign that critical work needs to be done. Beata helps me resist the temptation to be dismissive or to let up on the vision of America we have for our children. Privilege affords some people a lack of understanding and this election has brought that to light on a grand scale. We need to acknowledge truths and have difficult conversations. No matter our political leanings, empathy is the key to making the world a better place. Well, empathy and a strong commitment to helping others.My family from rural Michigan has strong ties to the Democrat party and community activism. My grandfather served as a Marine and was wounded on Iwo Jima in WWII. He is my hero and he taught us about compassion and love for community. My grandfather fought to advance American progress so that we might live in a nation capable of appreciating the patriotism of my Persian family, and the millions of others like them who make the United States special.At the moment, I can’t help but feel bad about reassuring my Persian family in Oregon that Michigan would deliver and Hillary would be our president. After all, Hillary stands for so many of the values and ideas ideas we embrace as part of our national fabric. I was swept up in my excitement that Michigan would join with millions of voters representing different races, ethnicities, religions and sexual orientations to shatter that glass ceiling and make her our president.I failed to realize that our brand of patriotism is not necessarily understood by others.I was reminded by level-headed friends who voted for Trump that fear can be a strong force to overcome and love needs people willing to fight vigorously for the cause. With humility, Beata has gracefully brought the challenge into focus for me. She has compelled me to share the story of love, devotion and hard work that has been her family’s experience in hopes others will embrace the diverse America we love so deeply.In defeat, we have come together to celebrate the promise of uniting people. Our nation will benefit from optimism and kindness.Beata’s intentional acts to teach our children how to love inspires me to deliver on the promise of our country.We are just getting started."

In this fifth of five special series installments, RaiseAChild contributing writer, Eric Criswell, learns about the internal battles that most parents experience when deciding to be advocates. It has been almost eight months since Lola Shahdadi and Lynne Witmer became what they always dreamed about: a family with their adopted daughter, Ella. As time passes, they reflect on the impact it has had on their lives, and hopefully on the lives of others.Lynne states it simply: “Our lives have become a musical. Everything we do is a song or a dance. That is just how life is right now, and everything we have in our house seems to talk or play music.”“Everything is different, but it is all a good different,” Lola adds. “Every aspect or your life changes when you become a family.”They do know that theirs was not a typical path for the foster adopt system. They started their journey with both preparation and trepidation.“We had both reached the decision that we wanted to be moms, and we talked a lot about what parenting would look like for us,” Lola admits. “I think our planning really helped us from being too shocked when we did become a family.”Like a lot of people, they explored various options for starting their family. But after getting a number of their questions answered by RaiseAChild, the two decided on the path of foster-to-adopt.They began the process, but initially became discouraged. Lola explains, “It can be scary and traumatic. One of the classes we had to take even had ‘trauma’ in its name, and we took a break from the program.”Lynne adds, “We just needed a moment to decide if this is something we really wanted to do.”The two did some soul-searching and realized they both wanted to build a family and make a difference for a child by providing the love they knew they had to give. With continued encouragement from RaiseAChild and support from their social worker at their chosen foster and adoption agency, Penny Lane Centers, they decided to resume their journey to get certified for foster adoption. Lola explains, “Our Penny Lane social worker was with us every step of the way to ease our fears.”One thing they learned, and try to impress on others, is that you have a voice in the life and family you are building. They decided they would be very clear on what they wanted and what their terms were.“It can all be very overwhelming,” Lynne said. “But when you realize you have a voice and that this is your life that is going to change forever, you make decisions from a better place that will serve everyone’s needs.”Lola continues, “I am not going to lie. It is hard, especially when you have to say no to someone. When we got our first call for a possible child placement, we didn’t feel it was a good fit for us. We were wrecked emotionally for a long time.”Though they knew the right fit may never come, it was not long till they got the call about a new born girl named Ella. “When we first got the call about Ella, it just felt right from the beginning. We did all we could to become Ella’s mothers.”Lynne explains, “From the moment we said yes to Ella, everything just seemed to start to fall into place.”Not only did the couple find their parental instincts when Ella was placed in their home, their daughter also helped the women find a passion and a voice that they didn’t know they had. At first, Lynne and Lola volunteered to speak at a few RaiseAChild and Penny Lane Centers events to share their family building experiences with prospective foster and adoptive parents. A few months ago, the women agreed that their family would volunteer again in a photo shoot for RaiseAChild’s National Adoption Month Campaign. Currently, images of Lola and Ella can be found flying high on streetlight banners over Long Beach and Los Angeles as part of the RaiseAChild National Adoption Month campaign across Southern California.“Of course, we agreed to participate in the campaign right away,” said Lynne. “But afterwards, Lola and I talked in depth about logical concerns and risks of what this exposure might mean to our daughter and our family.”“Especially now, these are not times to sit back and unplug,” Lola expressed passionately. “Each of us has a choice to hide and live in fear, or to speak out for what is right. In the case of children in the foster system, the statistics are staggering. Fact is that there are more foster children than foster parents in Los Angeles and across our country. So, if even one parent is inspired to foster or adopt from seeing our image or hearing our story, that means one or more children that will have a better life. That alone is a considerable outcome.”“Yes, advocating is most important to us because of the children,” Lynne admits. “In addition, we also advocate for the benefit of our LGBT community. Numerous studies have proven that LGBT people make great parents. But, only Lola and I know how having Ella has improved our relationship and our lives. So for us, advocating is less about ‘hey, look at us,’ and more about ‘hey, imagine what is possible for you.’”RaiseAChild thanks Tiffany Fierro, Olivia Hope, Giovanna Montoya, and Christen Schaefer of the Cinema Arts Program of Providence High School, Burbank, CA for volunteering to film, edit, and produce this inspiring RaiseAChild “Let Love Define Family®” video.Have you thought about building a family through fostering or adoption?

Stage and screen star Anthony Rapp has joined the cast of CBS’s “Star Trek: Discovery” as Lt. Stamets, an “astromycologist,” fungus expert, and Starfleet Science Officer who also happens to be gay, Entertainment Weekly reports.Also joining the lineup of “Discovery,” which will debut in May 2017 and is the first new “Star Trek” series since “Enterprise,” are Michelle Yeoh and Doug Jones, with additional casting to be announced by CBS in the coming weeks, according to Variety. Rapp, who is best known for originating the role of Mark Cohen in the smash Broadway musical, “Rent,” expressed his excitement about the new project on Twitter. Speaking to Entertainment Weekly in August, “Star Trek: Discovery” writer-producer Bryan Fuller vowed to include at least one gay character in the new series. “Absolutely we’re having a gay character,” Fuller, who is openly gay, said. Noting the amount of criticism his team received while working on “Star Trek: Voyager” when one of the characters was rumored to be gay, he added, “We’ve come a long way since then. I feel like actually gay rights have come a lot further in that time than race issues and women’s issues.”The creation of a brand new gay character should please series star George Takei. The 79-year-old icon, who originated the role of Hikaru Sulu in the original 1960s “Star Trek” series, was notably less than thrilled by the decision to reveal his character as gay in “Star Trek Beyond,” which hit theaters in July.“Unfortunately, it’s a twisting of [’Star Trek’ creator Gene Roddenberry’s] creation, to which he put in so much thought,” Takei, who came out in 2005 and has established himself as an outspoken LGBTQ rights advocate, told The Hollywood Reporter. “I think it’s really unfortunate.” Ironically, writer Simon Pegg and director Justin Lin said their decision to make Sulu (played by John Cho) a gay man in the film was intended as a tribute to Takei. However, a brand-new gay character ― played by a beloved gay actor, no less ― represents the kind of diverse, all-inclusive universe we’d like to live in. "

That’s just not something we can play around with.”The post-Brexit status of prescription drugs will depend on whether Britain requires UK-specific licenses on day one or whether there is a transition period for transferring current product licenses to a new system.Britain faces a two-year countdown to exit once the government gives formal notice of its intention to leave the EU, as Prime Minister Theresa May has pledged to do by March 2017.But there is a growing discussion about possible transition arrangements to avoid a “cliff edge”, which would be damaging for businesses across a range of industries. May hinted last week she might be open to such a transitional deal.The highly regulated nature of pharmaceuticals makes regulatory oversight a top concern for drugmakers, who currently use the European Medicines Agency (EMA) as a one-stop-shop to get drugs licensed across Europe.The EMA is based in London for now but it is likely to move to another city within the EU after Britain leaves the bloc.Leading drugmakers, including GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca, opposed Brexit in the run-up the June 23 referendum and the industry is pushing hard to keep Britain within the European regulatory network in some way.(Reporting by Ben Hirschler; Editing by Alexandra Hudson)"

68,MEDIA,Reporter Sopan Deb Shifts From Chronicling Donald Trump To Covering Culture,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sopan-deb-new-york-times_us_583ee1a5e4b04fcaa4d5dcb9,A 2016 standout for CBS News heads to The New York Times.,2016-11-30,CBS News correspondent Sopan Deb describes getting arrested at a Trump rally.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/583ee2a21800007b1431092d.png?cache=yvOhv6FBGI&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK ― Sopan Deb, who emerged as a standout 2016 reporter for his tireless coverage of Donald Trump, is joining The New York Times culture desk. In a memo to staff, Times Culture Editor Danielle Mattoon said Deb will “cover a spectrum of news – cultural, political, race/gender/class, way-we-live-now – through arts and entertainment lenses in the Trump era.”Deb, 28, joined CBS in 2014 as an associate producer following stints at NBC News, Al Jazeera Media Network, The Boston Globe and Major League Baseball. He became one of the network’s campaign digital journalists, or “embeds,” in June 2015, just as Trump entered the race.He followed the insurgent Republican candidate throughout the country for CBS News and even got arrested at one particularly raucous Chicago rally. But it was Deb’s Twitter feed, a rolling resource for Trump interview transcripts and fact-checks of the candidate’s claims, that distinguished the journalist. When Politico recently named Deb one the “breakout media stars” of the election season, a television executive described the reporter as “America’s representative to the Trump campaign” on account of his Twitter feed. The executive said that “every single person is trying to hire him.”In the memo internally announcing his hire, Mattoon cited Deb’s “ambitious, multi-platform articles, videos, and innovative storytelling” on the campaign trail, including his Twitter feed.“Most notably he pioneered a story form for fact-checking and analyzing Trump: Sopan transcribed the candidate’s remarks at rallies, events, press conferences, and interviews, then highlighted key sections and words and offered spot analysis ― posting it all relentlessly on Twitter,” she wrote. “With this approach Sopan was able to shine a singular spotlight on the most newsworthy, surprising, and troubling parts of Trump’s message. He also put Trump’s language in context so even the candidate couldn’t quibble.”While moving to the culture desk may seem surprising given Deb’s Trump-obsessed Twitter feed, he has interests outside politics. Deb is a classical pianist, as well as a stand-up comedian. “Sopan’s superb reporting during this fast-paced and high-charged election cycle was second to none, and we at CBS are sad to see him go,” CBS News Washington Bureau Chief Chris Isham said in a quote in the memo.Isham added he has no doubt Deb “will bring the same energy to his new beat.”Read the full memo below:I’m thrilled to announce that Sopan Deb of the CBS News politics team will be joining Culture as a general news reporter."

It’s a bad omen for the fight against climate change ― and may portend renewed hope for the controversial Keystone XL pipeline ― considering the president-elect has promised to ramp up fossil fuel production and spurned efforts to halt climate change.But Alberta Prosperity Fund chair Heather Forsyth hailed the move as “a strong signal to Canadians on the importance of this province to the United States” when the super PAC announced the visit on Tuesday.“This visit by such an influential member of a U.S. administration should stand as a call to action for all Alberta industry,” said Barry McNamar, founder and president of Alberta Prosperity Fund, in a statement. “I hope that Ms. Conway receives an enthusiastic welcome here in Alberta and can return to the U.S. with an informed attitude towards Canadian export products.”The tar sands have been a contentious place in American politics ever since the Keystone pipeline was proposed. It would have carried up to 730,000 barrels of Canadian oil into the country a day, but President Barack Obama rejected the project last year after environmental groups raised concerns about how expensive and dirty the fuel is to produce.Refining oil from tar sands is water-intensive and usually involves the clearing of large swaths of land. The finished product also results in substantially higher greenhouse gas emissions than other means of crude production.While Obama said Keystone wouldn’t “serve the national interest of the United States,” many are now looking to the incoming Trump administration to see if the president-elect plans to reconsider the pipeline. TransCanada, the company behind Keystone, said it planned to “engage” with Trump shortly after his election and a spokesman said they remained “fully committed to building” the pipeline. That sentiment was echoed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who has asked Trump to approve the pipeline should a proposal cross his desk.The Washington Post notes that Conway’s visit would “make a powerful symbolic statement about where a Trump presidency might come down on the proposed Keystone XL pipeline that President Obama rejected but which would, if revived, link the oil sands region in Alberta to advanced refineries on the Texas gulf coast.”However, even if Trump is amenable to tar sands, the price of crude oil has plummeted in recent years and the construction of Keystone may no longer be economically viable. Oil cost about $100 a barrel when the project was first proposed, but the price now hovers around $50.Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau approved two other tar sands pipelines on Tuesday, the Kinder-Morgan Trans Mountain and Enbridge Line 3, drawing sharp criticism from groups who said the decision contradicted pledges to mitigate climate change.“We’ve heard clearly from Canadians that they don’t want to see someone trying to make a choice between what’s good for the environment and what’s good for the economy,” Trudeau said at a press conference."

A few minutes before the scuffle, they had approached Deezia and his friends to ask about a companion who appeared visibly intoxicated. Officers say Deezia interfered and ultimately resisted arrest when they returned to question his friend. But Deezia claims the police used excessive force on him when they smashed his face against a glass door and slammed him onto a brick walkway.Video evidence is supposed to provide an objective record of the facts when police, defendants and witnesses present opposing narratives of confrontations like this. That’s just one reason body cameras have arisen as a rare point of agreement in the debate over police reform. But as the technology has grown in popularity around the U.S., cases like Deezia’s show why it’s an imperfect solution for issues of transparency and accountability.The officers who arrested Deezia were equipped with body cameras, but police say they weren’t activated during the incident. At least one body camera was turned on during an initial encounter with Deezia. However, it was off when the officers engaged with the group and the altercation escalated minutes later. The Lincoln Police Department released surveillance footage that appears to show a piece of the scene unfold, but also omits the key moment.With little evidence to go on, it took the jury only an hour to reach a verdict in Deezia’s case: not guilty on all charges. His excessive force lawsuit against the city is still pending.“Without the body cameras, they couldn’t take one person’s word over the other,” Seth Morris, Deezia’s attorney, told The Huffington Post.The fact that the body camera hadn’t been reactivated was a key point of concern for the jury, Morris said. Although the Lincoln Police Department hasn’t crafted an official policy on using the cameras, Morris said it was suspicious that the officer had initially remembered to turn on the camera, only to forget later.“No matter what did or didn’t happen, it just seems like you’re trying to hide something at that point,” he said.Still, it could have turned out much differently for Deezia. Jurors often aren’t so skeptical of police. When asked to choose between a defendant’s word and an officer’s, many will simply side with law enforcement.As the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts and University of California, Berkeley, School of Law argue in a report published Tuesday, this point further underscores just how important it is for police to use body cameras correctly. Such forms of monitoring are supposed to create an unbiased account of what was said and done by each party, which proponents say can keep officers and civilians honest.But as the devices have spread to police departments around the nation, there have been a number of incidents in which officers have failed to record critical incidents, including fatal shootings. Weak or nonexistent disciplinary rules for officers who fail to abide by body camera policies have compounded these problems.The ACLU/Berkeley Law report says courts at the state level should pressure police by instructing juries to disregard any testimony given by an officer deemed to have not recorded an incident or to have tampered with footage in a deliberate attempt to conceal the truth. If the jury were to conclude that an officer’s failure to record was unreasonable ― but not malicious ― the court would instruct the jury to devalue that officer’s testimony and infer that the video would have been beneficial to the defendant.“Courts have a special interest in ensuring that there’s footage available, because they’re the ones responsible for making sure juries reach accurate decisions and don’t lock someone up who doesn’t deserve to be there,” said Catherine Crump, acting director of the Samuelson Law, Technology & Public Policy Clinic at Berkeley Law and a co-author of the report.“If they start imposing those types of consequences, police departments will take more seriously the risk that if you don’t turn these things on, then you’re not going to be able to achieve your law enforcement objective,” she added.Although body cameras are regularly touted as a way to keep tabs on police brutality and use of lethal force, they’re also essential in much more routine law enforcement activity.A client of Washington, D.C., defense attorney George Lyon was arrested earlier this year for allegedly having an open container of alcohol in public. She maintained her innocence and said she was arrested because she had an attitude with an officer. Lyon began to prepare a defense because the city was intent on proceeding with the case. When he requested body camera footage from the arresting officer’s camera, he found that it showed the bottles in question were nowhere near his client. The prosecution eventually dropped all charges.Lyon said he’d be highly skeptical if he were defending a case in which an officer couldn’t provide a good explanation for a deactivated body camera.“If the police officer doesn’t turn on the camera or somehow the video is erased, I would argue that the jury should infer that the evidence that has been spoiled would have been favorable to a client,” he said. Under the proposal from the ACLU and Berkeley Law, courts would officially offer this guidance to juries.There is precedent for these sorts of jury instructions. In police interrogations, for example, officers used to be able to question suspects in custody without recording it. Now, over 20 states impose consequences for failing to record, often by instructing jurors to treat testimony with special caution in cases in which there is no video documentation of the interrogation.States like South Carolina have also passed statutes requiring officers to record audio and video of all DUI field sobriety tests. A failure to do so will typically lead courts to dismiss charges, as they view such oversights as fatal to most cases.“If the footage shows someone stumbling around, it’s hard for them to say that they weren’t impaired under those circumstances,” Lyon said. “By the same token, if they don’t appear to be impaired, the camera evidence is gonna show that as well.”Although courts may be able to help force the hand of police who have shown resistance to calls for change, they’re not a substitute for strong body camera policies designed to compel departments to commit to accountability and transparency. Still, in the current political climate, some legal experts believes it may take creative, unorthodox approaches like this to achieve certain policy goals.“Given what happened in the last presidential election, we may need to look elsewhere for progress on things like police reform,” Crump said. “This is a constructive effort to offer another way forward.” Clarification: Catherine Crump’s title has been updated to reflect that she is no longer with the ACLU."
74,POLITICS,Trump Claims He's Leaving His Company 'In Total' — But Doesn't Provide Any Details,"Steve Holland and Doina Chiacu, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-leaving-company_us_583ec512e4b0c33c8e13145e,"He says it's ""visually important"" to do so.",2016-11-30,"President-elect Donald Trump may turn over his business to his children, which presents conflicts of interest in and of themselves. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/583ee1391a00002500cca6e7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President-elect Donald Trump said Wednesday he’s leaving his business “in total,” but provided no details about who would take over.“While I am not mandated to do this under the law, I feel it is visually important, as President, to in no way have a conflict of interest with my various businesses. ... Hence, legal documents are being crafted which take me completely out of business operations. The Presidency is a far more important task!” Trump said in a series of tweets posted Wednesday morning.Trump said he would hold a news conference with his children on Dec. 15 to discuss the move away from his business.It’s unclear whether he intends to turn daily control of the Trump Organization over to his three oldest children ― Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric ― to run the privately owned conglomerate, or set up a blind trust. In a blind trust, the owner of a business relinquishes management of the company’s assets to an independent party to avoid conflicts of interest in public office.Trump’s lawyer said this month that the three adult children would control the blind trust. But then the president-elect enlisted all three to serve on his presidential transition team’s executive committee. Ivanka, widely seen as one of Trump’s closest surrogates, sat in on a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and on a call with Argentine President Mauricio Macri, casting doubt over the blindness of any trust led by the 35-year-old. Transition team spokesman Sean Spicer said working through the details is taking time, but that Trump is keeping his promise of devoting his full attention to the presidency. “He’s always been very clear that he was going to turn over the business to his adult children to run the family business, and that transition is what’s occurring right now,” Spicer said. But when asked whether Trump intended to divest himself of ownership of his various properties or merely managerial control, Spicer said the president-elect would provide that information next month.“Mr. Trump will walk through the details on the 15th of December. So stay tuned,” Spicer said.What Trump should do is appoint a truly independent trustee to sell his business and manage the trust while he is in office, periodically reporting only the value of the company’s assets, according to an op-ed by two former chief White House ethics lawyers under President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama.“A blind trust is defined by federal law as one in which a federal official selects an independent trustee (with no familial ties) who sells the official’s known assets and purchases investments unknown to the official,” Richard Painter and Norman Eisen wrote. “That is what makes it blind.”The nature of the Trump Organization’s business also makes it difficult to eliminate conflicts of interest in the White House. The company is largely a real estate and licensing company, with an empire of properties across the United States and a portfolio of buildings around the world that pay to brandish the Trump name. Trump’s companies operate in at least 20 countries, according to a hefty New York Times analysis published on Nov. 26.That makes it harder to erase conflicts of interest, or at least the perception of them. Trump may not oversee the day-to-day activities of his company, but a local official eager to curry favor with the White House could easily identify a Trump property to lodge in, host events at or fast-track for development.It’s already happening. Three days after Trump received a congratulatory call from Macri, a long-stalled tower in Buenos Aires got the green light from city officials. Both Trump and Macri denied reports that the incoming president asked for help clearing the permits to build the office tower. But it’s hard not to be skeptical. On a call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Trump touted his Turkish business partner as “a close friend” and passed on remarks that he is “your great admirer,” as The Huffington Post reported last week. The Embassy of Bahrain on Tuesday said it plans to host its annual National Day celebration at the newly opened Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., next month. The hotel became a flashpoint of the president-elect’s conflicts of interest when it suggested this month that foreign officials should stay there during official trips to help their relationship with the White House.Trump’s business interests represent an unprecedented web of conflicts of interest, particularly when compared to his predecessor. Obama’s assets, worth between $2 million and $7 million, are mostly tied up in Treasury bills and index funds. He and first lady Michelle Obama are still paying off a 30-year mortgage on their home in Chicago. S.V. Date contributed to this report.

Rick Snyder testifies at a House Oversight and Government Reform hearing. Snyder is pushing back against a court order to provide bottled water to Flint residents.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/583f37761a00002500cca878.jpeg?cache=nseY7DFa0o&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Nearly three weeks after a federal judge ordered Michigan officials to deliver bottled water to Flint residents who lack access to safe drinking water, the state continues to fight it.The preliminary injunction, issued by U.S. District Judge David M. Lawson on Nov. 10, calls for state and city officials to deliver bottled water to all Flint homes unless residents decline it or it is otherwise verified that the home has a properly installed, functioning water filter.The state appealed that ruling in a Nov. 17 court motion, calling the ordered water distribution a “herculean effort” that “would be on the magnitude of a large-scale military operation” and extremely costly. The state estimates it would cost at least $10.5 million monthly to carry out and is seeking an emergency motion to block the order.A ruling on the state’s motion is expected from the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals any day now. Until then, state and city officials are required to file a status report on their compliance with the order by Dec. 16.In a Tuesday call, representatives of the Natural Resources Defense Council, which along with the American Civil Liberties Union is a plaintiff in the lawsuit, criticized the state of Michigan for “spending its time litigating as opposed to assuring safe water to its residents.”The NRDC filed a brief Monday with the 6th Circuit describing the “harsh, on-the-ground reality” of Flint residents who are still “struggling to obtain enough safe water to meet their daily needs.” The organization is calling on the court to deny the state’s motion for a stay.“We’ve got an ongoing crisis to this day,” NRDC Midwest Director Henry Henderson said. “People do not have access to safe water. This is not consistent with what we expect to happen to residents of the United States of America.”The brief, authored by NRDC attorney Sarah C. Tallman, argues that the city’s and state’s response to drop off water filters at homes and operate water distribution sites is leaving many people behind, particularly residents without cars, the elderly and sick, and those who lack the “tools, strength or know-how to properly install, use and maintain filters left at their doors.”That situation, the brief continues, will only worsen as winter approaches and temperatures plunge.In response to the criticism, Anna Heaton, a spokeswoman for Republican Gov. Rick Snyder, asserted that the state is continuing to provide bottled water and filters to all Flint residents, “as we have been for months now, while also working on the plan for the massive logistics rollout needed to meet the order’s requirements.”Heaton also noted that the state has teams made up of Flint residents hired using Department of Labor grants along with state workers who are going door-to-door to check that provided water filters have been properly installed and maintained by residents.The state previously emphasized that at least 96 percent of Flint’s water customers have filters, so that would mean only about 4 percent of the city’s residents would require ongoing water delivery.Still, in a separate filing to the court Tuesday, attorneys for Flint joined the state in calling the district court’s injunction “overbroad” and noted that the city lacked the resources required to comply with it.State health officials are still urging Flint residents to drink the tap water only after it has been filtered to remove lead contamination that was first confirmed in September 2015 by Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, a pediatrician.Residents of Flint, a high-poverty, predominantly black city, had been complaining about the quality of their water soon after the city left the Detroit water system and switched its drinking water sources to the polluted, highly corrosive Flint River in April 2014.Since then, Gov. Snyder and President Barack Obama have declared states of emergency in Flint, and the city has begun the slow and expensive process of replacing its lead water service lines throughout the city. According to the city, a total of 260 homes through the end of October have either gotten new service lines or had their lead lines capped. In total, at least 30,000 Flint homes need service lines replace.It’s going to take a lot of money to make that happen, and Flint officials and activists alike are hopeful that federal assistance will play a key role.David Goldston, NRDC’s director of government affairs, called on Tuesday for Congress to approve immediate funding to help the residents of Flint before the end of its lame-duck session.The Republican-controlled House of Representatives authorized up to $170 million in aid to address Flint’s ongoing water crisis in late September, $50 million short of the level of funding the Senate proposed as part of the Water Resources Development Act both the House and Senate approved earlier this year.“Congress has done little but dither for the entire duration of the Flint crisis,” Goldston said. “The Republican leadership finally said they would insure money went to Flint, so in the next week or two we will see if they fulfill that promise.”House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said Tuesday that Flint’s aid is on track to be approved “one way or another” ― either through the water act or as part of a broader stopgap spending measure ― before year’s end.――Joseph Erbentraut covers promising innovations and challenges in the areas of food and water.

But if the high court accepts the Obama administration’s argument that neither the Constitution nor current statutes guarantee this kind of relief to a wide class of foreign-born detainees, the stance is sure to govern how Trump handles immigration policy. Trump has bashed President Barack Obama for releasing immigrants from detention while they await their deportations.Justice Elena Kagan, who forcefully challenged the government’s position in the case, known as Jennings v. Rodriguez, set the tone for how the court’s more liberal members might choose to rule in the case.“You can’t just lock people up without any finding of dangerousness, without any finding of flight risk, for an indefinite period of time, and not run into due process,” said Kagan, referring to the constitutional provision that forbids officials from depriving anyone, including non-citizens, of their liberty.There are “constitutional bounds” to keeping people in detention for more than six months without a chance to see a judge, she noted.“Don’t you think due process would require some periodic review to ensure that these people are properly being held?” asked Justice Sonia Sotomayor, observing that many of those who are caught up in immigration detention for long stretches have lived in the United States “for decades.”“What makes it unconstitutional in my mind is the unreasonable delay of detention,” said Sotomayor.Alejandro Rodriguez, the lead plaintiff in the class-action case, is a lawful permanent resident of the U.S. who has lived here since he was an infant. He was detained for more than three years without a substantive hearing, as the government sought his deportation based on two minor offenses ― misdemeanor drug possession when he was 24 and joyriding when he was 19. He challenged his detention and was eventually released, but the proceedings dragged on for seven years before an immigration judge canceled Rodriguez’s deportation and allowed him to remain in the country. But plenty of others who aren’t so lucky are still languishing in detention ― including undocumented immigrants, asylum-seekers and people, like Rodriguez, who are legally in the country but subject to removal.The Supreme Court’s task is to determine whether the complex web of immigration statutes that apply to these different groups of non-citizens affords them an opportunity to see a judge and vouch for their release ― or else whether the Constitution may grant them that right.The government is currently holding more than 40,000 people per day, and aiming to add capacity for 5,000 more who are going through removal proceedings or awaiting deportation. For many immigrants, the proceedings take years, particularly given the lengthy backlogs in immigration courts, where more than 520,000 cases are pending.And although Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials have the power to voluntarily release some immigrants, the agency is “essentially the jailer, said Ahilan Arulanantham of the ACLU of Southern California, who argued the case for Rodriguez and the class, which includes thousands of people. Immigrants should get a chance to go to a neutral party like an immigration judge as well, he said.“This is a class of mostly unrepresented people,” Arulanantham said, stressing the practical barriers non-citizens would face if their only recourse was to litigate their release on their own. “Everybody in the class, in our view, is entitled to an inquiry” by a judge, he said.Many of the members of the class ended up winning their cases, raising questions about whether their long-term detention was necessary in the first place. All members were detained at least 180 days during their pending deportation proceedings, and they spent an average of 404 days in detention. Nearly all of those initially detained at the border sought asylum and two-thirds were granted it, according to a brief supporting the ACLU’s position. Those who sought relief from deportation won their cases at a rate five times higher than the detained immigrant population generally.When Justice Samuel Alito questioned whether such a broad class of immigrants should have been allowed at all, Ian Gershengorn, representing the Obama administration, complained that the move was improper because affected immigrants get a chance to appeal their removal individually.“That one-size-fits-all approach is not the right way to do it,” Gershengorn said, suggesting that the law requires immigrants to challenge their detention individually in federal court. This drew a rejoinder from Kagan.“Wouldn’t it be better to set some guideposts that everybody in the country would know to follow rather than having one suit pop up here and one suit pop up here and another in another place and everybody would be treated differently?” Kagan asked. “That does not seem like a good immigration system.”If a definitive guidepost exists at all, a sweeping constitutional ruling in favor of immigrants might provide it. But the last time the Supreme Court handled an immigration case with constitutional implications, it deadlocked 4-to-4 ― which is also a possibility this time around.Chief Justice John Roberts seemed inclined to avoid a constitutional ruling or even be too aggressive with the law as it now stands.“Our job is to read the statute, and if it presents ― if it’s unconstitutional, that’s our job,” Roberts said. “But we can’t just write a different statute because we think it would be more administrable.”A decision in Jennings v.

Many thought the songwriter, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, would be in attendance at President Obama’s Wednesday meet-and-greet for American Nobel Prize winners at the White House, but instead he was a no-show. “Unfortunately, Bob Dylan will not be at the White House today. So everyone can relax,” White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters, according to The Hill. The outlet notes Earnest did not provide a reason for his absence.Since winning the award, Dylan has stayed pretty quiet. At first, he failed to acknowledge the award and The Swedish Academy (the organization that chooses the winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature) admitted he wasn’t answering their phone calls. Then, the bio on Dylan’s website was updated to include a note about the prize, but was since taken down. When Dylan did finally respond to the accolade, the 75-year-old musician told The Telegraph he would “absolutely” attend the ceremony “if it’s at all possible.”“It’s hard to believe,” Dylan said about receiving the award, adding it was “amazing, incredible. Whoever dreams about something like that?”After plenty of speculation about whether or not he’d actually show up to the Dec. 10 ceremony in Sweden where the prizes are awarded, the Swedish Academy confirmed the songwriter had “pre-existing commitments” and would be unable to attend.Dylan must still give a Nobel lecture, though, within six months counting from the date of the ceremony. Don’t think twice, Bob, just do it."

Mnuchin has drawn liberal criticism.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Progressive lawmakers and groups eager to expose President-elect Donald Trump as a populist in name only have found fertile ground in Steve Mnuchin, Trump’s choice for Treasury secretary.Thanks to his professional record, Mnuchin, a former second-generation partner at Goldman Sachs and hedge fund founder, would likely draw liberal criticism regardless of the president who appointed him.Mnuchin and his partners took over troubled bank IndyMac in 2008, renaming it One West and ramping up home foreclosures with a disproportionate focus on the reverse mortgages typically held by elderly Americans. Civil rights groups have accused the bank of racially discriminatory lending and business practices.If confirmed, which is all but assured, Mnuchin stands to oversee the very financial sector from which he profited handsomely. Perhaps it is no surprise then that Mnuchin has promised to roll back portions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law. Mnuchin’s history and positions would rankle Democrats in any year. But Mnuchin is not just any nominee: he is Trump’s. The president-elect ran as a champion of working Americans and slammed opponent Hillary Clinton for her ties to Wall Street.“President-elect Trump campaigned against big money’s power in Washington and accused Wall Street and hedge funds of ‘getting away with murder,’” Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee said in a statement. “But now he has picked a hedge-fund manager whose Wall Street ties couldn’t run deeper to lead the Treasury Department, which is exactly what this election showed the American people don’t want. This isn’t draining the swamp ― it’s stocking it with alligators.”Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), another member of the Banking Committee, also emphasized the apparent inconsistency of the selection.“If you want somebody to dismantle the protections for consumers he’s just the guy to do it. But that is in fact the opposite of what Trump campaigned on,” Merkley said on CNBC on Wednesday. “This is another broken promise from Donald Trump to ‘drain the swamp’ in Washington and not the change hardworking people in Wisconsin voted for,” Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) said in a statement.Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), widely considered Wall Street’s toughest foe in Congress, was perhaps the most unsparing in her criticism of Mnuchin, calling him “the Forrest Gump of the financial crisis ― he managed to participate in all the worst practices on Wall Street.”“His selection as Treasury Secretary should send shivers down the spine of every American who got hit hard by the financial crisis, and is the latest sign that Donald Trump has no intention of draining the swamp and every intention of running Washington to benefit himself and his rich buddies,” she said in a statement.Warren later issued a joint statement with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) condemning Mnuchin’s nomination.“Steve Mnuchin, is just another Wall Street insider. That is not the type of change that Donald Trump promised to bring to Washington – that is hypocrisy at its worst,” the senators said.The Progressive Campaign Change Committee, a liberal advocacy group, sounded a similar note in a statement condemning Mnuchin as “yet another out-of-touch billionaire who is more concerned with self-dealing for Wall Street than protecting Americans from the too big to fail banks.”“Trump’s supporters did not vote for him to put a second-generation Goldman Sachs banker who made a fortune foreclosing on working families’ homes in charge of the economy,” the organization said.National Consumer Law Center attorney Alys Cohen focused her statement on Mnuchin’s record of “profiting by foreclosing on older homeowners and homeowners in communities of color.”“We call on Mr. Mnuchin, if confirmed, to use his leadership to help Main Street recover from the economic crisis caused by Wall Street, not to benefit the 1%,” Cohen said.Mnuchin’s confirmation is virtually a foregone conclusion since he has aroused no public opposition from the Republican senators whose lack of support would jeopardize his nomination.But seeing a fight over Mnuchin as a long-term organizing tool, at least one liberal group, Demand Progress, is admonishing Democratic lawmakers to vote him down.“As Democrats work to re-establish their party’s credibility as a voice for working people, not one Senate Democrat should vote to confirm Wall Street billionaire Steven Mnuchin for Treasury Secretary,” Demand Progress’ Kurt Walters said in a statement."

That evening was captured for posterity on Busch’s album, “Live at Feinstein’s/54 Below,” which hits retailers Dec. 2.Despite the 62-year-old’s extensive résumé comprising stage, screen and cabaret credits, this is his first album — and he couldn’t be more thrilled with the results.“I can’t believe that I actually have a record out that I’m very, very proud of,” Busch told The Huffington Post. “I think it’s a very good representation of who I am, and where I am right now.”Just weeks after the album’s release, Busch will return to the Feinstein’s/54 stage Below for a special New Year’s Eve performance. That show will feature much of the same material as the album, he said, along with a few additional surprises.Busch told HuffPost that he’s aware that his show will cap off what’s been an incredibly difficult year for many, including those in the LGBTQ community, and as a result, he is planning to conclude the show on an optimistic, forward-thinking note.“I would suspect that my audience tends to be on my political wavelength, but… you never know,” he said. “It’s not really a place for me to be pontificating. But, at the same time, New Year’s Eve is a very profound moment every year.”Although Busch is tight-lipped on the specifics, he’d be remiss if he didn’t wear something fabulous in honor of the occasion, too. “Floating chiffon is good if you’re over 40,” he quipped.Charles Busch’s “Live at Feinstein’s/54 Below” will be released Dec. 2. He returns to Feinstein’s/54 Below on New Year’s Eve. For more information, head here. "
82,POLITICS,Mitt Romney After Donald Trump Dinner: He Can 'Lead Us To That Better Future',,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/romney-trump-dinner_us_583e4b96e4b0c33c8e130346,"Romney, Trump and Reince Priebus dined on frog legs at a French restaurant at one of Trump's hotels.",2016-11-30,"Romney, Trump and Reince Priebus dined on frog legs, scallops, steak and lamb chop at a French restaurant at one of Trump's hotels.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/583e4de11a00000b03cca626.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK, Nov 29 - Republican Mitt Romney made an impassioned statement in support of President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday to try to erase doubts about him among Trump’s supporters and remain in contention for U.S. secretary of state.Romney, a fierce critic of Trump during the Republican presidential primary battle, stopped short of an outright apology but his intention to wipe the slate clean was clear.The former Massachusetts governor, who was the Republican presidential nominee in 2012 and lost, praised Trump for a “message of inclusion and bringing people together” since his Nov. 8 victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton.Noting the appointments Trump has made to fill key cabinet positions for his administration and his desire for greater unity among Americans, Romney said that “all of those things combined give me increasing hope that President-elect Trump is the very man who can lead us” to a better future.Romney made his remarks after a lengthy meal with Trump and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus at a French restaurant at a Trump hotel in Manhattan. They dined on garlic soup with frog legs, scallops, steak and lamb chop.Prior to Trump’s election win, Romney was a harsh critic of Trump.“Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud. His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University. He’s playing the members of the American public for suckers. He gets a free ride to the White House, and all we get is a lousy hat,” Romney said in March.Since Trump began to seriously consider Romney as a potential secretary of state, some on Trump’s team have voiced doubts about bringing in a former critic and rallied around their preferred candidate, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a long-time Trump friend and loyalist.Leading this effort in an unusually public way has been senior Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, who told a round of television interviews on Sunday that Trump supporters would feel “betrayed” if Romney was picked.Trump, however, has kept Romney in contention for the secretary of state position, and a Republican source close to the transition effort said Priebus has been pushing for Romney behind the scenes.“I had a wonderful evening with President-elect Trump,” Romney said in remarks to reporters after the dinner. “We had another discussion about affairs throughout the world and these discussions I’ve had with him have been enlightening, and interesting, and engaging. I’ve enjoyed them very, very much.”Trump is also considering U.S. Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.Corker met Trump at Trump Tower earlier on Tuesday and told reporters afterward that Trump “needs to choose someone that he’s very comfortable with and he knows there’s going be no daylight between him and them.”“The world needs to know that the secretary of state is someone who speaks fully for the president and again, that’s a decision he’s going to have to make,” Corker said.(Reporting by Steve Holland; Editing by Nick Macfie)"
83,POLITICS,Ethics Agency Trolls Donald Trump With Bizarre Tweets,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-government-ethics_us_583f46cee4b017f37fe27a88,"“Brilliant! Divestiture is good for you, very good for America!”  the Office of Government Ethics tweeted.",2016-11-30,"Donald Trump with his children Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump at the Republican National Convention on July 20, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/583f47f21800009314310b07.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The Office of Government Ethics released a stream of odd tweets on Wednesday that praise President-elect Donald Trump’s plan to hand control of his real estate empire to his three eldest children.It was a very strange use of Twitter by a government agency.“We can’t repeat enough how good this total divestiture will be,” read the first tweet from the main ethics agency overseeing the executive branch.Earlier, Trump had tweeted that he was leaving his “great business in total” to his children Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric Trump, following promises to hand them control of his Trump Organization and its subsidiaries after winning the presidential election.Yet he has never stated that he would completely divest from the business, liquidate its assets and put them in a blind trust ― which would actually alleviate concerns about conflicts of interest.Still, the OGE appears to be framing Trump’s decision to consciously uncouple from his business as a “total divestiture” that does “what handing over control could never have done.”Because Trump did not explicitly mention divestiture, which would involve selling his business, it’s possible the tweets were meant sarcastically, as a way to force the president-elect to engage with the agency or admit that he has no actual intention of divesting.Some of the OGE’s tweets appear to mimic the prose style of the president-elect: “Brilliant! Divestiture is good for you, very good for America!” The agency also echoes Trump’s vague claim about leaving his business “in total”: One tweet hinted at conversations the agency has had with Trump’s lawyers: “We told your counsel we’d sing your praises if you divested, we meant it.”Similar tweets sent from the account Wednesday morning were subsequently deleted, causing speculation they were the work of a hacker or a rogue employee. The tweets were re-sent in the afternoon, however. A statement from the agency’s spokesman, Seth Jaffe, confirmed that the agency meant to send them.“Like everyone else, we were excited this morning to read the President-elect’s Twitter feed indicating that he wants to be free of conflicts of interest,” the statement reads. “OGE applauds that goal, which is consistent with an opinion OGE issued in 1983. Divestiture resolves conflicts of interest in a way that transferring control does not. We don’t know the details of their plan, but we are willing and eager to help them with it.”“The tweets that OGE posted today were responding only to the public statement that the President-elect made on his Twitter feed about his plans regarding conflicts of interest. OGE’s tweets were not based on any information about the President-elect’s plans beyond what was shared on his Twitter feed. OGE is non-partisan and does not endorse any individual.”"
84,RELIGION,These Teen Boxers Show Us All The Real Meaning Of Sportswomanship,Carol Kuruvilla,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/muslim-boxer-amaiya-zafar_us_5835fcb7e4b01ba68ac412cf,A Muslim boxer wasn’t allowed to fight in modest clothing. So her opponent shared the win.,2016-11-30,Aliyah Charbonier (left) wears a scarf to show solidarity with Amaiya Zafar.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/583e0c8b1700002500e7ce67.jpeg?ops=crop_0_449_1512_1164%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Amaiya Zafar is a 16-year-old amateur boxer from St. Paul, Minnesota, who has never gotten the chance to fight in an official competition. She’s a Muslim who wears a hijab and covers her arms and legs while fighting ― which isn’t approved by international boxing regulations ― so she’s usually banned from the ring before her matches even begin. When Zafar and her family arrived at the Sugar Bert Boxing National Championships in Kissimmee, Fla. on November 20, they knew she may not be able to fight. But what they weren’t expecting was that a stranger ― Zafar’s opponent, in fact ― would come to her defense.When Zafar was disqualified, her potential opponent, Aliyah Charbonier, was not happy. So Charbonier decided to put solidarity before victory, telling Zafar that she would share the winner’s belt.“She told me that what they did wasn’t fair,” Zafar told The Huffington Post. “That she hadn’t earned the belt.”Charbonier told The Washington Post that she felt “really bad” for Zafar.“It’s just not right,” the boxer said. “It’s not really a distraction for me what she’s wearing. She still had on gloves and headgear.”In the end, both girls reportedly went home with belts. Although they were strangers before, Zafar said they’ve been in touch ever since the championships.“It was an emotional moment. Because it’s been three years that I’ve been training, and I got so close [to fighting],” Zafar said. “When she gave it to me, it felt like she was recognizing ... how hard I worked and how unfair it is.”Sarah O’Keefe, Zafar’s mother, said that after she got disqualified, her daughter was trying her best to stay calm and patient. Zafar isn’t the type to get angry or upset ― instead her mindset is to accept whatever happens as the will of God. So when Charbonier gave Zafar her belt, it was a powerful reminder that in addition to working hard to get these rules changed and trusting in God’s providence from above, there are also people who were willing to stand in solidarity with her. “It showed that even though Amaiya is alone in her request, she’s not alone in action or prayer,” O’Keefe told The Huffington Post. “Aliyah giving her the belt made a bigger statement than we could have planned for. She’s saying, ‘You’re not alone, I stand with you.’”Zafar began boxing about three years ago. She fell in love with the sport after watching a live boxing game. She said she appreciates the discipline that the sport demands. “When I’m in the gym, it’s like the real Amaiya,” she said. “Like dripping sweat and tears and screaming. Just working really hard.”O’Keefe said that it’s been tough for her daughter to find opponents that are suitable to her weight and her age group. In addition, USA Boxing, a national governing body for Olympic-style boxing in the U.S., follows a strict dress code set up by the International Boxing Association (AIBA). Michael Martino, executive director of USA Boxing, told MPR News last year that boxing while wearing leggings and long-sleeved shirts is a “safety issue.”“If you’re covering up arms, if you’re covering up legs, could there be preexisting injury?” Martino said. “And then if someone got hurt during the event, the referee wouldn’t be able to see it.” O’Keefe said that she’s hoping to see these organizations engage in a discussion about this issue, and about how to get more Muslim women involved in boxing.“If it’s about safety, let’s negotiate and think about what we’re trying to accomplish,” O’Keefe said. “So far they haven’t yet had a conversation about what [Zafar] is trying to request and what accommodations to make.”In December last year, USA Boxing indicated that it would request a waiver from AIBA that would allow Zafar to compete. The family hasn’t received an update on that request. Requests for comment sent to USA Boxing and AIBA by The Huffington Post were not answered. The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a national Muslim civil rights organization, is calling for USA Boxing and AIBA to make a religious exemption to uniform regulations ― following the lead set by organizations like the International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) and the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA), which have given Muslim women who wear hijabs a chance to compete in tournaments.“All athletes should be able to compete in their sport of choice without facing roadblocks based on outmoded and discriminatory policies,” CAIR’s National communications director Ibrahim Hooper said in a press release.Zafar is also hoping that the rules will change in time for her to compete in the Ringside World Championships, a competition for amateur boxers scheduled to take place next summer. She said she’s been heading to the gym an average of three to four hours every day to stay on top of her game.“A big part of [my identity] is my religion and boxing,” Zafar said. “I don’t want to lose one of those for the other. I should be able to have both.”"
