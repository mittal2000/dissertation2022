0,LATINO VOICES,Two Of Puerto Rico’s New Overlords Are Accused Of Helping Create Its Debt Crisis,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/puerto-rico-control-board-debt-crisis_us_58544d53e4b0390447088ce4,A new report calls for the former bank executives to quit the island's fiscal control board.,2016-12-17,"Governor-elect Ricardo Rossello will formally lead Puerto Rico starting in January, but the fiscal control board will still have power over key decisions.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58544f6b120000590eeefc3c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Activists are calling for the resignation of two members of Puerto Rico’s fiscal control board over the roles they previously played in boosting bank profits at the expense of the island’s financial health.The control board, which has veto power over major Puerto Rican budget decisions, was created by Congress in June as the island foundered under $70 billion in public debt. A new report, titled “Pirates of the Caribbean,” argues that control board members José Ramon Gonzalez and Carlos Garcia should be held accountable for their part in plunging the island into debt. The paper, released Thursday, comes from two progressive coalitions, Hedge Clippers and the Committee for Better Banks, which both seek to combat the political power of financial institutions.Before they were appointed to the control board, Gonzalez and Garcia moved between top positions in Puerto Rico’s Government Development Bank (GDB), which issues the island’s government bonds, and Banco Santander, the Spanish-owned mega-bank that was buying and structuring the vast majority of those same obligations.The report alleges that Garcia, Gonzalez and other executives at Santander presided over an explosion of lucrative underwriting that allowed the financially strapped island to continue borrowing huge sums, but on increasingly risky terms. The structure of those loans, the report suggests, was more favorable to Santander and other financial institutions than to the government ― and thus the taxpayers.Santander participated in the underwriting of $61.2 billion of the island’s $70 billion in debt, according to the analysis. The report estimates that more than $1 billion went toward management fees for Santander and other banks. The island shelled out another estimated $735 million to the banks to cancel interest rate swaps ― bets the government had made on future interest rates.For the loans it underwrote, Santander frequently set up onerous payment structures using exotic financial tools, the report says. For example, the Santander loans cost Puerto Rico $1.5 billion in “capitalized” interest payments ― that is, the island was also borrowing to pay the interest on its loans. And complicated 2009 bond issue that Santander underwrote netted Puerto Rico $139 million, but required it to pay back $730 million ― five times the value of the loan ― according to the report.Gonzalez and Garcia held top jobs at the private bank as it profited off Puerto Rican taxpayers, when they weren’t running the government entity that was issuing those bonds.Gonzalez, who had been president of the GDB from 1986 to 1989, became head of Santander Securities, the arm of the bank that underwrote Puerto Rican debt, in 1996. In 2002, he moved up to CEO of Santander’s Puerto Rican holding company, a job he held until 2008.Garcia similarly began working in Santander’s Puerto Rican operations in the late 1990s and held a number of leadership roles. He left the bank in 2009 to become president of the GDB and returned to Santander in 2011 for another top executive job.The revolving door similarly spun for others in Puerto Rico’s banking community. Juan Carlos Batlle, another Santander executive, took Garcia’s place as chief of the GDB in 2011. At the same time, Batlle’s brother Fernando left a top post at the GDB to head up Santander Securities.As Puerto Rico’s debt rose, the island’s elected officials began pushing the burden of repayment onto the public. Beginning in 2009, then-Gov. Luis Fortuño instituted major austerity measures, laying off tens of thousands of public employees.“Santander and other banks purposefully manipulated a government desperate to avoid financial ruin and shared in over a billion in collected profit as it pushed Puerto Ricans deeper and deeper into nearly unrecoverable poverty,” Stephen Lerner of the Hedge Clippers coalition said in a statement accompanying the report. “Santander, as well as former Santander executives who now serve on the fiscal control board, must pay the price.”Hedge Clippers and the Committee for Better Banks, which held a press conference to promote the report Thursday outside Santander Holdings USA headquarters in Boston, are asking the bank to refund the underwriting fees it charged Puerto Rico and urging Garcia and Gonzalez to resign from the fiscal control board.They also want the control board and the Puerto Rican government to allow a government-sponsored commission currently auditing the island’s public debt to complete its work with adequate funding. Governor-elect Ricardo Rossello, who will assume office in January, has not been completely clear about his plans for the commission.It is unlikely that Santander, Gonzalez and Garcia will agree to the activists’ demands.Neither Garcia nor Gonzalez responded to a request for comment.Santander Holdings USA declined to address the demands of the report, but offered a general statement about the bank’s interaction with the Puerto Rican government.“In the financial services industry, it is not uncommon for business leaders to work in the private sector and then move on to serve in government,” said spokeswoman Ann Davis. “It is also common industry practice for financial institutions, like Santander, to underwrite bonds and issue financial instruments to support economic growth ...,” she added. “The public and private sectors have guidelines in place to prevent conflicts of interest and Santander has always required strict adherence to these guidelines to ensure ethical business practices.”But Thursday’s report provides new ammunition to the people and groups in Puerto Rico and the mainland United States who have long argued that banks and other financial institutions should be held to account for their role in facilitating and exacerbating Puerto Rico’s debt crisis.“This report provides more evidence that the people who created the crisis also profited from the crisis,” said professor Charles Venator, a specialist in Puerto Rican politics at the University of Connecticut.The average Puerto Rican has not similarly benefited. The austerity measures adopted to address the massive debt ― which many experts believe Puerto Rico will never be able to pay off ― have sparked an increase in poverty and a decrease in public health. Puerto Ricans have flocked to the mainland U.S. to escape deteriorating living conditions. The island’s population dropped almost 7 percent from 2010 to 2015, leaving fewer residents to generate the revenue needed to fund the government.Now the fiscal control board is demanding more austerity, insisting that outgoing Gov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla scale back his proposed budget.To be sure, the authors of the new report have their own stake in how the island chooses to distribute the financial pain. Both Hedge Clippers and the Committee for Better Banks have among their coalition members labor unions representing workers in Puerto Rico, including the American Federation of Teachers and the Communications Workers of America.But the composition of the control board is a matter of concern for all Puerto Ricans, said Bartlett Naylor, a financial policy advocate at Public Citizen.“If Puerto Ricans are required to suffer broken promises as debt is restructured, the least they should receive is oversight from officials completely disconnected from the mess-making, let alone those who profit from it,” Naylor said."

Other Virginians have expressed fear about threats to groundwater, given the porous nature of the karst landscape of the state’s Giles County where some of the pipeline is slated to go.Pipeline supporters include Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) and local business leaders, who say the project would create jobs, lower energy costs and potentially attract new business.A public comment period on the project will run through Dec. 22. Anyone can have file a comment on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission website, or call or write to FERC Secretary Kimberly Bose. The Appalachian Trail Conservancy has also put together a comprehensive guide on how to contact members of the Virginia and West Virginia legislature and representatives of the U.S. Forest Service."

Swinton’s casting was immediately met with resistance from the Asian and Asian-American community, which has historically been erased and stereotyped on screen due to Hollywood selecting white actors to play roles intended for them.“Tilda eventually emailed me and she said that she didn’t understand why people were so mad about ‘Doctor Strange’ and she wanted to talk about it, and wanted to get my take on why all the Asian people were mad,” Cho told actor Bobby Lee on his podcast TigerBelly. “It was so weird.”Cho and Swinton evidently had a “long discussion” about whitewashing in the film industry, which the “Snowpiercer” actress asked her not make public. The conversation struck an uncomfortable note for Cho, an unapologetic critic of Hollywood’s representational deficiencies, who in her own words, ended up feeling like a “house Asian.” In response to Cho’s interview, Swinton’s team released the entire unedited email exchange on Friday for “the opportunity to clarify and with all good wishes to all,” according to Vulture. Later that night, Cho made a statement reiterating that “Asian actors should play Asian roles,” but writing that she remains a huge fan of Swinton’s.The five emails between the two actresses were written in May 2016 months before the premiere of “Doctor Strange,” as the backlash to Swinton’s casting gained traction.

Durst is currently awaiting trial for his alleged involvement in Berman’s killing after he admitted in the final episode of the miniseries that he was responsible for multiple deaths. “What the hell did I do?” he said while in the bathroom and unaware of a microphone on his person. “Killed them all, of course.” Hours before the finale aired, Durst was arrested in New Orleans on a murder warrant under suspicion that me might try to flee the country. He was discovered in a hotel in possession of a firearm, $40,000 in cash and a latex mask. Durst was later charged with Berman’s murder, but has since maintained his innocence.However, he did plead guilty to a federal gun charge which could result in a sentence of more than seven years in prison, if he is not convicted of murder.

Children raised overseas are generally self-confident, open-minded, and resourceful. They learn to make friends easily and to adjust and to adapt quickly.If you're hesitating making an international move because you have children, you're making a mistake.That, however, is not to say that raising kids in another country is easy.When you make a move overseas with children, they, specifically the options for their education, become your priority. Moving with children also means that you must move full-time or at least that you must schedule your part-time life in your chosen haven around their school calendar.My daughter Kaitlin, age 8 at the time, cried herself to sleep every night during our first year living in Waterford. She was fiercely opposed to the idea of leaving her grandmother, her cousins, her friends, and her school in Baltimore behind, and she made sure we were painfully aware of that fact every single day.""You've ruined my life!"" she sobbed night after night as she fled from the dinner table to her bedroom and slammed the door.My husband Lief and I thought we were doing precisely the opposite. We believed we were enriching Kaitlin's life and expanding her horizons. But, I have to admit, some nights I'd lie awake wondering if maybe Kaitlin weren't right. Maybe launching a new life in a foreign country at age 8 would translate into years of psychotherapy down the road.Our first year in Paris it was Kaitlin's little brother Jackson, age 4 at the time, born in Ireland, who struggled through the transition.""Give him six weeks,"" his preschool teacher advised me every morning when I dropped him off. ""At this age, he'll adapt very quickly. In six weeks, he'll speak French, and he'll be fine. You'll see.""Meantime, every morning, as I'd turn to leave, Jackson would wrap his arms around my ankles, crying and begging, ""Please don't make me stay here... they don't have an English voice, and I can't find my French voice.""I'd pull myself free and race out the door and down the street, fighting back tears myself and wondering, again, if this moving around the world with kids thing was really such a good idea. Six agonizing weeks later, though, and,voila, seemingly overnight, Jackson spoke French. He'd adjusted; he'd made friends.In truth, our lifestyle has been easier for Jack to handle than Kaitlin. While Jack was born into it, Kaitlin might say she was yanked. On the other hand, it was Kaitlin's idea to move from Waterford to Paris.Kids in Ireland take what is called a ""Gap Year"" at age 15, between what would be their freshman and junior years of high school in the States. For this year, many study or take internships abroad. As they approached their Gap Year, Kaitlin's friends began making plans to attend school in the United States, Britain, and elsewhere. Kaitlin decided she'd like to spend the year in Paris.We'd been enjoying Irish country life, but, by this time, we were wanting for more cosmopolitan distractions. We took Kaitlin's suggestion, therefore, as an opportunity for another family move.In the essay Kaitlin prepared as part of her admissions application for St. John's College in Annapolis three years later, she wrote, ""I fought against my family's move to Ireland and resisted life in that country completely. But, if not for Ireland, I probably wouldn't have gone to Paris. And now I can't imagine not having had the chance to live in Paris...""As I've mentioned, perhaps the most fundamental decision you must make when relocating overseas with children concerns their education. Will you send your child to a local school (where, unless you're moving to Belize or Ireland, for example, he'll need to learn to speak the local language fluently), to a bilingual international school (where he'll have the opportunity to learn the new language but will take classes, as well, in his native tongue), or to an American school (where he'll be largely insulated from the local culture and community)?In Ireland, Kaitlin attended a local private school. In Paris, we enrolled Jack in the local public school. (In France, public schools are more highly regarded than private ones. Kids get kicked out of public school for not meeting study or discipline standards, not vice versa.) In Panama, Jackson is attending the French school, from which he'll graduate next year with a French bac (fingers crossed).In other words, just as we've chosen to go local with our lifestyles overseas, so, too, we've gone local with our children's education. Why drag the kid to a new country only to enroll him in a school that could as easily sit in any U.S. suburb? We considered this question head-on in Paris, where the American School of Paris was one of our options for Kaitlin's education in this city. Kaitlin and I visited together, and we both had the same reaction.The American School of Paris could be the American School of Any American Town. Every student is from the States, as is every member of the faculty. English is the only language spoken. The curriculum, the calendar, the sporting events, the special events, the locker rooms... everything about the school is as it would be Stateside. Nothing wrong with this, per se, but it seemed a shame to us for Kaitlin to miss out on the chance to learn French, to make friends from all over the world, and to become part of the Paris teenager scene.In addition to schooling options, moving with children you also must consider health care and local kid-friendly opportunities. Are there parks, playgrounds, private tutors, and places where the child could go to study the guitar, to learn to dance, or to take karate lessons?Likewise, you must think more seriously about residency options. With a child, you can't as easily reside under the radar. I don't recommend residing overseas without proper papers under any circumstances, of course, but, over the years, I've known expats in France, Panama, Thailand, and elsewhere who've never gotten around to legalizing their stays. Sometimes, this is not a big deal. With school-aged children, it can be more difficult. This restriction, especially, can take a number of countries off the list of options, as it would be difficult or even impossible to organize legal residency for you and your family.Moving abroad with children, your biggest worry might be their ability to adapt and to adjust. It has been mine. Having now moved my then 8-year-old daughter from the States to Ireland, then my then 14-year-old daughter and 4-year-old son from Ireland to France, and, then, most recently, my then 8-year-old son from France to Panama, here's what I can tell you: Your children will be fine. The truth is, their move will be harder on you than it will be on them. They will learn the new language quicker than you will, they will make new friends more easily, and they will assimilate more readily.If you let them.Our first six months in Paris, Kaitlin would sit at the dining room table after dinner doing her homework--all in French. Before our arrival in this country, she'd never studied the language. Then, overnight, she was studying in the language, doing high school math in French. The work would take her hours, after which she'd retire, exhausted and nearly in tears.Then she'd have to get up the next morning to return to school, where, again, all lectures, presentations, and course materials were in French. This shouldn't be so hard on her, the mother in me couldn't help but observe. I made an appointment to meet with her advisor at school, who said this:""Kaitlin is struggling, yes. But you must let her struggle. It is good for her.""This is the last thing a child wants to hear and the hardest thing for a parent to accept. But I tell you now, it is the right thing, the true thing. After six months of exhausting effort, Kaitlin was bilingual. She retains this asset, which, already, has opened doors for her. Her first year of college back in the United States, it was her overseas experience and her second language that helped her to land a part-time job in a chic photography gallery.Here's my best advice for the parent considering relocating overseas with a family:Don't worry how your children will adjust. Worry how you'll survive the adjustment period.Kathleen PeddicordOriginal Feature: The Truth About Retiring And Living Abroad With ChildrenRelated Articles:Travel With ChildrenMoving To Panama With Kids And The Unexpected ResultsTis' Christmas Season In Panama City, PanamaEarlier on Huff/Post50:"

You'll see.""Meantime, every morning, as I'd turn to leave, Jackson would wrap his arms around my ankles, crying and begging, ""Please don't make me stay here... they don't have an English voice, and I can't find my French voice.""I'd pull myself free and race out the door and down the street, fighting back tears myself and wondering, again, if this moving around the world with kids thing was really such a good idea. Six agonizing weeks later, though, and,voila, seemingly overnight, Jackson spoke French. He'd adjusted; he'd made friends.In truth, our lifestyle has been easier for Jack to handle than Kaitlin. While Jack was born into it, Kaitlin might say she was yanked. On the other hand, it was Kaitlin's idea to move from Waterford to Paris.Kids in Ireland take what is called a ""Gap Year"" at age 15, between what would be their freshman and junior years of high school in the States. For this year, many study or take internships abroad. As they approached their Gap Year, Kaitlin's friends began making plans to attend school in the United States, Britain, and elsewhere. Kaitlin decided she'd like to spend the year in Paris.We'd been enjoying Irish country life, but, by this time, we were wanting for more cosmopolitan distractions. We took Kaitlin's suggestion, therefore, as an opportunity for another family move.In the essay Kaitlin prepared as part of her admissions application for St. John's College in Annapolis three years later, she wrote, ""I fought against my family's move to Ireland and resisted life in that country completely. But, if not for Ireland, I probably wouldn't have gone to Paris. And now I can't imagine not having had the chance to live in Paris...""As I've mentioned, perhaps the most fundamental decision you must make when relocating overseas with children concerns their education. Will you send your child to a local school (where, unless you're moving to Belize or Ireland, for example, he'll need to learn to speak the local language fluently), to a bilingual international school (where he'll have the opportunity to learn the new language but will take classes, as well, in his native tongue), or to an American school (where he'll be largely insulated from the local culture and community)?In Ireland, Kaitlin attended a local private school. In Paris, we enrolled Jack in the local public school. (In France, public schools are more highly regarded than private ones. Kids get kicked out of public school for not meeting study or discipline standards, not vice versa.) In Panama, Jackson is attending the French school, from which he'll graduate next year with a French bac (fingers crossed).In other words, just as we've chosen to go local with our lifestyles overseas, so, too, we've gone local with our children's education. Why drag the kid to a new country only to enroll him in a school that could as easily sit in any U.S. suburb? We considered this question head-on in Paris, where the American School of Paris was one of our options for Kaitlin's education in this city. Kaitlin and I visited together, and we both had the same reaction.The American School of Paris could be the American School of Any American Town. Every student is from the States, as is every member of the faculty. English is the only language spoken. The curriculum, the calendar, the sporting events, the special events, the locker rooms... everything about the school is as it would be Stateside. Nothing wrong with this, per se, but it seemed a shame to us for Kaitlin to miss out on the chance to learn French, to make friends from all over the world, and to become part of the Paris teenager scene.In addition to schooling options, moving with children you also must consider health care and local kid-friendly opportunities. Are there parks, playgrounds, private tutors, and places where the child could go to study the guitar, to learn to dance, or to take karate lessons?Likewise, you must think more seriously about residency options. With a child, you can't as easily reside under the radar. I don't recommend residing overseas without proper papers under any circumstances, of course, but, over the years, I've known expats in France, Panama, Thailand, and elsewhere who've never gotten around to legalizing their stays. Sometimes, this is not a big deal. With school-aged children, it can be more difficult. This restriction, especially, can take a number of countries off the list of options, as it would be difficult or even impossible to organize legal residency for you and your family.Moving abroad with children, your biggest worry might be their ability to adapt and to adjust. It has been mine. Having now moved my then 8-year-old daughter from the States to Ireland, then my then 14-year-old daughter and 4-year-old son from Ireland to France, and, then, most recently, my then 8-year-old son from France to Panama, here's what I can tell you: Your children will be fine. The truth is, their move will be harder on you than it will be on them. They will learn the new language quicker than you will, they will make new friends more easily, and they will assimilate more readily.If you let them.Our first six months in Paris, Kaitlin would sit at the dining room table after dinner doing her homework--all in French. Before our arrival in this country, she'd never studied the language. Then, overnight, she was studying in the language, doing high school math in French. The work would take her hours, after which she'd retire, exhausted and nearly in tears.Then she'd have to get up the next morning to return to school, where, again, all lectures, presentations, and course materials were in French. This shouldn't be so hard on her, the mother in me couldn't help but observe. I made an appointment to meet with her advisor at school, who said this:""Kaitlin is struggling, yes. But you must let her struggle. It is good for her.""This is the last thing a child wants to hear and the hardest thing for a parent to accept. But I tell you now, it is the right thing, the true thing. After six months of exhausting effort, Kaitlin was bilingual. She retains this asset, which, already, has opened doors for her. Her first year of college back in the United States, it was her overseas experience and her second language that helped her to land a part-time job in a chic photography gallery.Here's my best advice for the parent considering relocating overseas with a family:Don't worry how your children will adjust. Worry how you'll survive the adjustment period.Kathleen PeddicordOriginal Feature: The Truth About Retiring And Living Abroad With ChildrenRelated Articles:Travel With ChildrenMoving To Panama With Kids And The Unexpected ResultsTis' Christmas Season In Panama City, PanamaEarlier on Huff/Post50:"

10,ENTERTAINMENT,The Dubai Film Festival Diaries: A Classy End To A Life-Changing Event,"E. Nina Rothe, ContributorCultural Activist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-dubai-film-festival-d_b_13670660.html,,2016-12-17,2016-12-17-1481972376-3167247-150176_gal_968_645_629058522.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-12-17-1481972376-3167247-150176_gal_968_645_629058522-thumb.jpg," OK, I'll just preface this by saying that were the majority of film reviews written by women, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story would never have been made. I'm probably a Star Trek girl through and through because I like a little reflection to go along with my entertainment. Not a whole lot of references to things I know nothing about nor want to particularly find out. But more on the film that closed this year's Dubai International Film Festival later in the blog.The reason that DIFF exists and just celebrated its glorious thirteenth edition is primarily to showcase and support the ever-growing Arab cinema industry. Yet we all know that a festival without international stars, great world premieres and exclusive parties would not be on anyone's radar for very long. And this year, DIFF brought to Dubai Hollywood royalty like Andie MacDowell and Samuel L. Jackson, HBO's Westworld stars Jeffrey Wright and Luke Hemsworth, filmmaker extraordinaire Asif Kapadia, world-class composer Gabriel Yared and Indian superstars of past, present and future Rekha, Om Puri and Ranveer Singh. Along with of course the great auteurs from the Region like Yousry Nasrallah and Magdy Ahmed Aly, as well as world festival favorites like Hedi by Mohamed Ben Attia and Layla M. by Mijke De Jong. The red carpets were plentiful, the atmosphere electrifying and the result of the seven days and eight nights was a festival like no other -- where media, filmmakers and audiences alike could enjoy the beauty of Dubai and absorb as much cinema as their appetite allowed.As I waited one morning to interview Jeffrey Wright and Luke Hemsworth about Westworld, I listened in on their conversation with other members of the media. I have loved Wright's honest acting since I watched him in Julian Schnabel's Basquiat and I follow his blunt yet so needed Tweets on social media. The man doesn't dwindle around serious issues. For example, see below.So, I did what I did back in Berlin with Gianfranco Rosi, at the beginning of his journey with his documentary Fire at Sea -- I used the waiting time to color my interview. The host of the Arabic version of a well-known US entertainment TV magazine asked Wright if he could say a few words in Arabic, and Wright admitted that he'd learned some Arabic twenty years ago and at that time ""I learned to love Umm Kulthum then, I love her music!"" It was warming to hear him say those words as the Egyptian singing legend has become for me inseparable from this Region. Everywhere I go, be it a shop in a mall, a restaurant or even at gala events, her haunting voice is the soundtrack of Dubai, and beyond.When he was asked about the recent US election, Wright also managed to put into words what we've all been feeling by saying, ""America is going through an interesting phase right now. I think it's going to be an interesting next few years."" Most of us have been feeling like the real work begins now and hearing Wright address that by pointing out that the election had brought out ""a real awakening of people who are concerned about tolerance and social justice all the things that the results of this election seem to have cast aside,"" made me hopeful. He finally added, ""America is a big country. And we're stronger than any one person. America is really not defined by its presidents, it's defined by its people. At the end of the day I hope we become a better country and progress forward. I'm hopeful that at the end of the day we'll keep progressing forward as we have.""When the time came for his co-star Luke Hemsworth, the young Australian actor wasn't as lucky with his questions. ""Do you feel bad that you're the shortest of all the Hemsworth brothers?"" The host chimed in. I am often baffled by the complete lack of any class in TV journalism. Not that print media is that much better, but at least we have a time delay from when we formulate stupid questions to when we actually transcribe the interview to realize the errors of our ways... Anyway, Hemsworth was kind, and quick on his feet. ""They stole all my food when I was growing up!"" He replied, and I secretly giggled, at the TV host, while clapping inside for the star.I'd come to DIFF really craving to finally meet in person Shirley Abraham and Amit Madheshiya, as well as watch on the big screen, where it belongs, their masterpiece creation The Cinema Travellers. Back when the film premiered in Cannes, their publicist and our common friend had sent me a link to watch the documentary and write a little something about it. Sitting in my favorite corner of my apartment, holding their jewel of a film in my hands, I felt like I had just been handed a gift. My world became part of theirs for nearly 100 minutes, and I was immersed in the wonderful joy of cinematic magic. But watching it then in Dubai, on the big screen where most films belong, was like discovering a whole new film within The Cinema Travellers, like finding new visual and emotional clues that I could never have imagined on the screen of my laptop. And meeting Abraham and Madheshiya in person finally solved the puzzle of how such a beautiful film could ever have been made... It took two beautiful human beings, that's how!DIFF this year was also about fashion. For me, the festival always holds its finger on the pulse of what Dubai fashionistas are wearing, but for its thirteenth edition, they went one step further. While people lined up for the Middle East premiere of the Will Smith starrer Collateral Beauty, we were all treated to a fashion show on the red carpet, organized by the Dubai Design District, also known as D3, and Fashion Forward Dubai. Five designers who create and sell in the Region -- Zareena, Amato, Michael Cinco, Ezra and Hussein Bazaza -- presented their evening looks in front of DIFF Managing Director Shivani Pandya, the Executive Director of Operations Mahsa Motamedi and yours truly, all sitting in the privileged front row. I loved the flavor of fashion on the red carpet, this time even overshadowing the celebrities and the films for a few minutes. But of course, I always feel fashion provides the perfect frame to cinema and art.There was also an announcement during this year's festival that felt like the right thing at just the right time. As the shortlist for the Foreign Language Academy Awards seems to have completely ignored cinema from the MENA region this year, the Arab Film Institute will hopefully step in. A new entity that promises to ""promote, inspire, preserve, educate, support, influence and engage Arab film professionals under one roof,"" the AFI has brought together producers, filmmakers, political figures and critics to create a database that may eventually give birth to an award platform for the Middle East, from the Middle East and within the Middle East. Of course, there was cinema at DIFF, films to satiate even the hungriest of cinema goer. For me, the event closed with two works, one I loved, and one I could really have lived without.Magdi Ahmed Ali's Mawlana (The Preacher) felt to me like it should have been named ""The Prophet"" since on the day it premiered it hauntingly foretold of the day's events. Mawlana tells the story of a moderate Imam, a religious leader followed and beloved by those around him, yet whose tolerant views are being challenged every day, by what happens in the world. It doesn't hurt that the film stars Egyptian actor Amr Saad in the lead role and his charisma and restrained demeanor as Sheikh Hatem El Shennawi really sell the film to the audience. But perhaps most haunting for me was discovering the scene of a Coptic Christian church bombing which had just occurred before the film's red carpet, sending chills up my spine. When a beautiful, touching film has that prophetic feel to it, I can't help but find it a winner.So now onto DIFF's closing night film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. This felt like an overdrawn, too dark and too full of references to things I know nothing about, video game. Granted, if you are a huge Star Wars fans it will be a treat to find Peter Cushing resurrected by CGI as the Imperial Officer Grand Moff Tarkin from the 1977 original Star Wars: A New Hope. Thrilling? Well it would have been if the 3D glasses I found on my seat weren't used and therefore smudged beyond what any cleaning could do to them and the images of Cushing felt inconsistent throughout. His presence didn't do it for me. I get it that Star Wars fans will celebrate anything to do with the franchise, from T-shirts (even I had to get an overpriced one of Darth Vader dressed as an Arab dictator) to merchandise to yes, tired old films. But what is up with Felicity Jones and those constant ""meaningful"" looks she shoots at her co-stars? Having just watched her in The Tempest, I can't say her acting has gotten any better with age. And don't get me started on Diego Luna, a brilliant actor who is completely miscast here. His accent gives Captain Cassian Andor a Speedy Gonzales feel I just could not get over and I giggled each time he opened his mouth. I did like Riz Ahmed, but I've liked him in each and every role he's played since The Reluctant Fundamentalist. Am I being PC about this? Probably not, but I haven't felt this strongly about how much I hated a film in a long, long while... Yes, the red carpet with the Chewbacca crew was fun, but other than that, as I said, I'm a Trekkie through and through. Finally, a thank you to the festival, its organizers and the publicists who made my life so perfectly organized and pleasant for the past week or so. This edition of the Dubai International Film Festival was indeed a ""Lucky 13"" one for me and receiving the thank you note that I've posted as the header image of this piece, the day after DIFF ended, was the cherry on the cake. From the opening gala and party to the closing night film and big bash, with a live soundtrack provided by the Reyes Heritage (the sons of the Gypsy Kings) there wasn't a dull moment or a sour note for Dubai, throughout. And the logo created by local designer Ash Chagla of Science Sunshine proved to bring just as much luck as it promised. Till next year DIFF, from December 6th to the 13th, 2017 -- Inshallah.Red carpet and portraits photos by Getty Images, all courtesy of DIFF, used with permission. "
11,SPORTS,Nailed To The Chessboard For 50 Years,"Lubomir Kavalek, ContributorInternational Chess Grandmaster",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nailed-to-the-chessboard_b_12717582.html,,2016-12-17,2016-12-17-1481933917-1914399-SpasskyFischerchess77677.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-12-17-1481933917-1914399-SpasskyFischerchess77677-thumb.jpg,"Bobby Fischer became the youngest grandmaster in 1958 at the age of 15. When he faced Boris Spassky in Santa Monica in 1966 under Jacqueline Piatigorsky's watchful eye, his record was still intact. The year 1966 was memorable. It was the first year I played chess as a grandmaster.""A grandmaster title is like a driver's license,"" the Serbian grandmaster dr. Petar Trifunovic once told me. ""You don't yet know how to drive well, you learn on the go.""The World Chess Federation (FIDE) started honoring chess players with the title of Grandmaster (GM) in 1950. There are nearly 1550 chess grandmasters in the world today. A half century ago there were just 94 GM titleholders. In 1966 the Chess Informant published the first volume. The Chess Olympiad was played in Havana. Mikhail Tal turned 30. Fischer faced Spassky in the second Piatigorsky Cup. Spassky challenged Petrosian for the world title and I reported on that event as a journalist. First things first. My graduation from national master and International master took just seven months before I made my last grandmaster norm in December 1965 in Leipzig. The newspaper Večerní Praha (The Evening Prague) announced it the next day with a little drawing. ""You are now nailed to the chess board, young man,"" the nestor of Czechoslovakian chess, Karel Opocensky, told me on the train to Prague. I laughed it off. What did he know?Born in 1892, the same year as the world champion Alexander Alekhine, Opocensky was a player, journalist and the chief arbiter of important events such as the world championship match. He had seen many generations of chess players and compared me to young Salo Flohr. At the same time he told me I would never become a world champion: ""You have no discipline or patience. You only want to attack. Chess is hard work. You have to take care of small details.""The GM title opened some opportunities for me. I started to write chess and cultural columns in one daily and became editor of the final sports editions in two newspapers in Prague. I was also a subject of some interviews. Sometimes the photographers tried to be too original.I went to Bucharest in March 1966 for my first tournament as a grandmaster. It was won by Viktor Korchnoi and I finished third. My game against Milan Matulovic was voted third best in the Chess Informant behind two games between Petrosian and Spassky. Here is the final combination:Kavalek,Lubomir - Matulovic,Milan Bucharest 1966 19.Rxf6!!  A prelude to the combination to win material.  19...Bxf6 20.Nf5!!  Changing of guards. The knight makes the square g3 available to the pawn.  20...gxf5 21.g3!  The final point. The Queen seems trapped. There is only one way to save it.  21...Bc3  A desperation. but other moves do not help.

After 32...Kh7 33.Qd7+ mates.Flohr was the only Czechoslovakian player in history with a world championship contract in his pocket, signed with Alekhine in the Alcron hotel in Prague in May 1938. The World War II intervened, Flohr emigrated to the Soviet Union and never played the match.   Flohr was always one of the best dressed chess players, a draw for advertisers. In the 1930s Flohr was pushing Bata shoes.The famous Czech new film wave started to gain momentum in 1966. Jiri Menzel was making ""Closely Watched Trains"" that won the Academy Award for the best foreign film in 1968. In 1966 he appeared in the fashion column of the most popular Czech magazine Mlady svet (The Young World) and I followed him.""Put your hand in the pocket and don't smile,"" I was told. Magnus Carlsen did it much better 45 years later. He put both hands in his pockets. Eventually, the pictures ended up in the magazine and life returned to normal.Boris Spassky was the strongest player in the world in 1966. He won Candidates matches against Paul Keres, Efim Geller and Mikhail Tal in 1965 and finished first in the 1966 Piatigorsky Cup ahead of Bobby Fischer, Tigran Petrosian and Bent Larsen. In the world championship match Spassky narrowly lost to Petrosian 11.5-12.5.I covered the match together with Flohr. His phone calls from Moscow were full of sartorial details. He even reported on grandmasters' ties, socks and shoes. The articles, typed on a typewriter, appeared in the paper the next day. No live coverage, only occasional photos or drawings were used in the reports.During Game 10 Flohr told me that it was a beautiful Monday and Petrosian would rather go watch his favorite soccer team Spartak than to play Spassky. Instead, Petrosian created one of his most famous combinations. The Exchange sacrifice was one of Petrosian's trademarks. He was not careless with his rooks, he just turned them into great positional weapons. He managed to get rid of both rooks in Game 10 and finished with a splendid tic-tac-toe combination.Petrosian, Tigran - Spassky, Boris World Championship match, Game 10, Moscow 196621.Ne3! Not wasting any time, Petrosian is bringing the knight into the attack.  21...Bxf1?! Spassky accepts the challenge, but weakens the light squares. Instead, he could have simplified with a little combination: 21...Rxf4!? 22.Rxf4 Qg5+ 23.Rg4 Bxg4 24.Nxg4 Nxg4 25.Bxg4 Qxg4+ 26.Kh1, forcing 26...Qd4 27.Rg1+ and now: A. 27...Kf8? 28.Qb1!! threatening a mating attack; 27...Kf7? 28.Qb1!! wins.

This Bishop is clearly stronger than the black Rook on a8. Salo Flohr even argued that White has two light pieces for the Rook because we can't really count the out-of-play knight on a5. 23...Nxf4?!  Opposing the white Queen on the long diagonal a1-h8 leads to a squeeze: 23...Qf6! 24.Be6+ Kh8 25.Qxf6+ Rxf6 26.f5 Ne5 27.Ne4 and the black position is falling apart.  24.Rxf4! The sacrifice of the second Exchange is pretty, but Petrosian could have waited one more move, bringing his knight closer to the black King: 24.Ne4! Qe8 25.Rxf4! winning.  24...Rxf4 25.Be6+ Rf7 26.Ne4 Qh4  After 26...Raa7 27.Nf5! Qf8 28.Qf6! Black can barely move.  27.Nxd6 Qg5+  The black Queen is lost after 27...Qe1+ 28.Kg2 Qxe3 29.Bxf7+ Kf8 30.Qh8+ Ke7 31.Nf5+ Kd7 32.Be6+ Kc7 33.Qxh7+ and White wins. 28.Kh1 Raa7  After 28...Qxe3 29.Bxf7+ Kf8 30.Qh8+ Ke7 31.Nf5+ Kd7 32.Be6+ wins.  29.Bxf7+ Rxf7  30.Qh8+!  A beautiful finale! The knight finishes the job after: 30...Kxh8 31.Nxf7+ Kg7 32.Nxg5 wins. Black resigned.The Chess Informant picked up two Petrosian's wins from the match as the top best games of the first issue. The Yugoslav publication with important annotated games became the single best tool to study openings. Before computers took over, Petrosian called the young generation ""the children of Informant.""Meantime, I finished third at the Zonal in the Hague behind Svetozar Gligoric and Istvan Bilek. I qualified for the 1967 Interzonal in Sousse, where Bobby Fischer played 10 games, including seven wins, before he withdrew. I was one of the three players making a draw against him. The knight sacrifice in that game has been influencing opening theory in the Poisoned Pawn variation of the Najdorf Sicilian for the next 30 years.The Olympiad was played in Havana, Cuba, and I saw Fischer live for the first time. He resurrected the Exchange variation of the Spanish with wins against Lajos Portisch, Eleazar Jimenez and Gligoric.I have selected a fragment from the recently published book ""Checkmate"" by Russell Enterprises. It is a collection of Fischer's Boys' Life columns, a rare look into his way of thinking, and worth reading. Fischer,Robert James - Gligoric,Svetozar  Havana ol (Men) fin-A (8) 1966The position is from one variation not played in the game and avoided by Gligoric. It shows how deadly and precise was Bobby Fischer's mind.  15.Na4! Kb8 [15...Qxd1 16.Rxc7+! transposes.] 16.Rxc7! Qxd1 17.Rc8+!! Ka7 [17...Kxc8 18.Nb6#] 18.Bb8+ Ka8 19.Nb6 mate.  A fairy tale mate.I had the best score on the Czechoslovak team in Havana and on this high note my first year as a grandmaster ended. It didn't cross my mind that 10 years later I would collect a gold medal on the U.S. team that won the 1976 Olympiad in Haifa. It didn't cross my mind that I would be nailed to the chessboard for the next 50 years.Spassky became the world champion in 1969. It turned out that Carlsen was not the only champion to sacrifice the Queen on the square h6. I witnessed how Spassky did it before he won the world title in the last round of the 1960 Student Olympiad.Spassky,Boris Vasilievich - Marsalek,Josef Student olympiad Leningrad (15) 196021.Qh6!!  Like in the last game of the Carlsen-Karjakin World championship match in New York in 2016, the Queen sacrifice on the square h6 ends the game: 21...gxh6 (21...Bf6 22.Bxf6) 22.Nxh6 mate.

15,LATINO VOICES,We Have No Idea How Many Latinos Get Arrested Or Imprisoned In The U.S.,Roque Planas,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/we-have-no-idea-how-many-latinos-get-arrested-or-imprisoned-in-the-us_us_58531d9ce4b08debb7884370,Advocates want law enforcement to start tracking the ethnicity of those who wind up in the criminal justice system.,2016-12-16,"Inmates with mental health conditions are escorted to the the Correctional Treatment Center Hospital at the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department Twin Towers Correctional Facility in Los Angeles on Sept. 23, 2014.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58531ee71800002d00e42e6b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"All law enforcement agencies should track data on Hispanic ethnicity because no one has any idea how many people ensnared by the criminal justice system in this country are Latino, according to a study released Thursday by the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan research organization. Unveiling a new tool that shows the confused patchwork of different policies on collecting ethnicity data across the 50 states, several civil society organizations that participated in the study urged law enforcement agencies to pick one standard and follow it uniformly so the public and the FBI can see how the criminal justice system affects the country’s largest ethnic minority. Some 40 states reported race in their arrest records, but only 15 reported ethnicity, the groups’ survey found. Some reported Hispanic or Latino identity as a race, rather than an ethnicity, contradicting the Census Bureau’s practice. The data collection, however, shifted as people passed through the different phases of the justice system, with different standards for populations facing arrest, imprisonment, parole or probation. The only state that routinely collected publicly available data on both ethnicity and race for people at all four stages of the system was Alaska. Seven percent of Alaska’s 738,000 population was Latino as of last year, according to Census figures. “No one knows how many Latinos are arrested, how many in prison, how many are on probation or on parole,” Ryan King, a senior fellow with the Urban Institute Justice Policy Center, said on a call with reporters. Government bureaucracies have historically struggled to collect accurate data about Hispanics who wind up in the criminal justice system. Law enforcement has long collected data on race, dividing people up as black, white, Asian or Native American. But the terms “Latino” and “Hispanic” refer to a multiracial ethnicity based on country of birth or ancestry. It’s possible to be Latino and belong to any race. That phenomenon has also led to confusion at the Census Bureau. The agency collects information on Hispanic ethnicity, but 36.7 percent of Hispanic respondents said they belonged to “some other race.” While no accurate racial statistics for American Hispanics exist, most Latin Americans are people of color and mixed race. The Census Bureau doesn’t make use of common Latin American terms used to refer to people mixed race, like “mestizo” (Indigenous and European) or “mulato” (African and European) or Afro-Latino. In the absence of a universal standard, many law enforcement agencies simply lump Latinos along with whites for the purposes of racial statistics. A 1987 effort to track data about Latinos by the Federal Bureau of Investigations was quickly abandoned due to the lack of standards in place at the local level. It was only revived three years ago. Juan Cartagena, the president and general counsel of LatinoJustice PRLDF, said conflating the two groups had the effect of masking the criminal justice system’s tendency to disproportionately ensnare people of color. It also makes it harder for reformers to deal with the problem. “When you leave Latinos out of the count, you effectively are taking Latinos out of policymaking decisions,” Cartagena said. Fixing the problem is as easy as asking whether people arrested, jailed or paroled identify as Hispanic, he added. “These solutions are accessible both economically and bureaucratically,” Cartagena said. “It’s 2016. Latinos are the largest minority ethnic group. … To actually have states sit back and not be able to say honestly how many Latinos are in the criminal justice systems that they control and management is an outrageous affront. It’s time that this changes.”"
16,POLITICS,Conservative Group Wants Trump To 'Ferret Out' Pro-LGBT State Department Workers,Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-lgbt-state-department_us_58545b9be4b039044708b7cc,A new twist on old McCarthyism.,2016-12-16,"Donald Trump, next to Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_1634_115_3394_2009%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"A leading social conservative organization is calling on the Trump administration to “ferret out” employees at the State Department who worked to promote LGBT rights and replace them with conservatives. The Family Research Council, in a little-noticed statement on Thursday, accused the Obama administration of having deployed the State Department to advance an LGBT agenda, and argued it was incumbent on the next secretary of state ― likely ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson ― to stop it. “I certainly don’t see Tillerson cut from the same cloth as [Hillary] Clinton or [John] Kerry, but he doesn’t have to be for these anti-life, liberal social policies to continue,” said a statement that appears to be written by the group’s president, Tony Perkins. “He must have the courage to stop the promotion of this anti-family, anti-life agenda, which is very much a question mark given that he capitulated to activists pushing to liberalize the Boy Scouts’ policy on homosexuality when he was at the helm of the organization. “The incoming administration needs to make clear that these liberal policies will be reversed and the ‘activists’ within the State Department promoting them will be ferreted out and will be replaced by conservatives who will ensure the State Department focuses on true international human rights like religious liberty which is under unprecedented assault,” the statement concludes. The Family Research Council is one of the last remaining major interest groups to wage these types of cultural wars. But there is a dark, McCarthyist undertone to the idea that an incoming administration should remove civil servants who have pushed for the advancement of LGBT rights; in part because it’s a slippery slope to removing people who are, themselves, LGBT. Trump has been far more moderate on LGBT rights than many Republicans ― perhaps a reflection of his cosmopolitan, socially liberal upbringing. And it would be an abrupt about-face for him to take this advice after repeatedly criticizing Hillary Clinton for not standing up further to countries that didn’t have strong records on LGBT rights.Indeed, after this article was published, Trump’s transition team released a statement expressing strong opposition to the Family Research Council’s appeal. “President-elect Trump campaigned on a message of unity in order to bring all Americans together. To think that discrimination of any kind will be condoned or tolerated in a Trump Administration is simply absurd,” Trump spokesman Jason Miller said.But Trump’s transition team has also tried a variation of ferreting at another agency. His transition sought the names of Department of Energy employees that worked on climate change matters. The department this week denied that request.This article has been updated to include comment from a Trump transition spokesman."

In 2014, media reports of sharply rising drug prices led to Congressional hearings.Mylan has been criticized for classifying EpiPen as a generic product, which led to its paying significantly smaller rebates to state Medicaid programs for the poor than if the drug were classified as branded.The company said in October that it would pay $465 million to settle questions on the impact of the classification on U.S. government healthcare costs.Mylan said earlier this month it expected to cut less than 10 percent of its workforce to integrate its acquisitions.Mylan’s shares were up about 1 percent in early trading on Friday.(Reporting by Ankur Banerjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Martina D’Couto)"

The award is CAIR’s direct response to the political rise of President-elect Donald Trump, whose rhetoric has targeted Muslims and inspired hate crimes against Americans who are visibly practicing the Islamic faith ― along with Sikhs and others who are mistakenly identified as Muslims. The self-described alt-right movement, which promotes racist and xenophobic views, often suggests that Islam is inherently violent by citing the mistreatment of minorities such as Jews and Christians in the Muslim-majority world.Interfaith solidarity is more important now than ever, the Muslim group’s communications director, Ibrahim Hooper, told The Huffington Post.“In an atmosphere in which many wrongly believe there’s an inherent conflict between Jewish and Muslim communities, it sends a strong message that that is not the case — that members of the Jewish and Muslim community have a tremendous amount amount in common on issues of social justice and civil liberties,” Hooper said. CAIR believes the Jewish group will be a leading advocate to ensure Muslims in America are not left alone to defend their communities, he added.Both Muslim and Jewish people, along with many other groups, have been targets of hate since Trump’s election, making coordination and cooperation between advocacy organizations even more important, JVP member Donna Nevel said.Jewish Americans expressed their concern as Trump received support from former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke and offered a position in his administration to white nationalist Steve Bannon of Breitbart News ― and as vandals defaced U.S. schools, synagogues and homes with swastika graffiti after Trump’s Nov. 8 victory. In addition to its work protesting Israel’s activities in the Gaza Strip, West Bank, and East Jerusalem, JVP has fought bigotry in the United States. In 2013, the group created an initiative called the Network Against Islamophobia to bolster interfaith organizing.“Having work rooted in principles of commitment to furthering justice is critical at this time. But it’s not just about one event or one action ... it’s about being there for the long haul. CAIR and JVP try to exemplify that work,” Nevel said.CAIR will also present a Defender of Liberty award to the Center for Constitutional Rights. Protecting Muslims’ constitutional rights is a top priority for the organization, Hooper said, in light of the Muslim registry and Muslim ban Trump promoted during his campaign.“The American Muslim community is feeling a lot of apprehension and concern about the future, and it’s imperative to build coalitions” with potential partners, Hooper said. “We can learn from them and cooperate to prevent the erosion of civil rights.”The Huffington Post is documenting the rising wave of anti-Muslim bigotry and violence in America.

Donald Trump’s transition continues to stir mixed feelings. And the percentage of the public who see themselves as middle class is on the rise. This is HuffPollster for Friday, December 16, 2016.MOST APPROVE OF OBAMA’S JOB PERFORMANCE - Pew Research: “With just a few weeks left in Barack Obama’s presidency, Americans’ early judgments of his place in history are more positive than negative. Obama is poised to leave office on a high note: Current assessments of both the president and the first lady are among the most favorable since they arrived in the White House. At the same time, many express skepticism about whether Obama has been able to make progress on the major problems facing the nation, and whether his accomplishments will outweigh his failures....Obama is set to leave the White House with a job approval rating only slightly below Reagan’s and Clinton’s. Currently, 58% approve of his job performance, while 37% disapprove….Obama’s average job rating over the course of his presidency is more politically polarized than any president dating to Dwight Eisenhower….Views of Obama’s place in history also are split along racial lines. Blacks are twice as likely as whites to say history will judge Obama as above average or outstanding: Fully 76% of blacks and just 38% of whites say this.” [Pew] ACA seen as a signature achievement  - More from Pew: “In the public’s view, Obama will be remembered more for the Affordable Care Act than other aspects of his presidency — including his election as the nation’s first black president. When asked what Obama will be most remembered for, 35% volunteer the 2010 health care law (or mention health care more generally) while 17% say it will be Obama’s election as the first black president. Notably, mentions of Obama’s domestic policies, including health care and the economy, account for nearly half (49%) of all responses. By comparison, only 9% point to foreign policy, including just 2% who specifically mention the killing of Osama bin Laden and just 1% who cite U.S. military action against ISIS.”AMERICANS THINK THE COUNTRY IS GOING DOWNHILL, BUT THEY’RE PRETTY HAPPY WITH THEIR OWN LIVES - HuffPollster: “Americans largely think the country has headed in the wrong direction during the past eight years, a new HuffPost/YouGov survey finds, but most also feel that their own lives have improved over that period of time. Thirty-six percent of all Americans think things in the U.S. have generally gotten better over the past eight years, according to the poll, while 52 percent say things are on the wrong track….To dig a little deeper, the HuffPost/YouGov survey also asked respondents to rate the direction things have taken in national politics ― presumably the topic many people are thinking about while answering the question ― but also the direction of their state, community, and their own well-being….Americans say by a 33-point margin that national politics have been headed off on the wrong track for the past eight years, and by a smaller 7-point margin that things in their state have gone off-track as well. But they also say by a 13-point margin that things have generally been going right in their community, and by a 27-point margin that things are going right in their own lives.” [HuffPost]NEARLY 60 PERCENT OF AMERICANS CONSIDER THEMSELVES ‘MIDDLE CLASS’ - Frank Newport: “The percentage of Americans who say they belong in the upper-middle and middle class has edged up to an average 58% this year, compared with 50% in 2012 and 51% in 2015….The shifting percentages over the past eight years in those identifying as middle class occurred mostly among those without a college degree. Middle-class identification among those with college degrees has been more stable ― and high….The rise was not confined to just one partisan group and was not a direct result of the election of Donald Trump. Perhaps most importantly, middle-class household incomes rose last year, and the shift from lower- and working-class to middle-class identification could reflect these real-world circumstances.” [Gallup]TRUMP’S POLICIES EXPECTED TO HELP THE WEALTHY - HuffPollster: “Americans widely expect Donald Trump’s presidency to benefit the wealthy, according to a HuffPost/YouGov survey released on Tuesday, although those who voted for him believe he’ll be more egalitarian. A 44 percent plurality of respondents expect Trump’s economic policies to mostly favor the rich, with 15 percent saying he’ll favor the middle class, 2 percent that he’ll favor the poor, and 18 percent believing that he’ll treat all groups equally. Yet more than three-quarters of Trump’s supporters expect him to work mostly for the middle class or to treat all groups equally, with just 6 percent believing he’ll help the rich….While 27 percent of Americans consider Trump a populist and 22 percent don’t believe that he is, the majority, 51 percent, say they aren’t sure.” [HuffPost] More from the latest national polls:-Fox News: “President Obama ends his presidency with positive ratings for his overall job performance as well as his handling of the economy, according to the latest Fox News Poll. Yet while more people feel positively about the economy today than have in more than a decade, not many say their family’s financial situation has improved since Obama took office.” [Fox]-CBS News: “With the inauguration a little over a month away, just over a third of Americans (34 percent) think President-elect Trump will be a good or very good president, and another 23 percent think he will be average. Thirty-six percent think he will be a poor president.” [CBS]-McClatchy/Marist: “At the midpoint of his transition, President-elect Donald Trump faces a nation rife with dissatisfaction of its direction and pronounced partisan and racial divisions. Nearly half of voters nationally express approval in how Trump has been carrying out his transition, and a plurality of voters nationally say they think President-elect Trump is taking the country in a better direction. But, Americans have reservations about whether or not he can unite the country and believe it is more divided than it was before Election Day.” [Marist] -HuffPost/YouGov: “Four years after the Sandy Hook massacre, less than a tenth of Americans think that the U.S. has made any progress toward preventing gun violence, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov survey. Nine percent of Americans say that society has gotten better at preventing gun violence, while 53 percent say it hasn’t changed, and 26 percent that things have worsened ― an even gloomier outlook than in December 2014, when just 18 percent believed things had gotten worse.” [HuffPost] -Pew Research: “[S]ome Americans say they themselves have shared fake news. Overall, 23% say they have ever shared a made-up news story, with 14% saying they shared a story they knew was fake at the time and 16% having shared a story they later realized was fake.” [Pew]HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!

U.S. government officials said the leaders of Congress and the chairmen of the two intelligence committees, known as the “Gang of Eight,” have been briefed on the CIA’s conclusion.Nevertheless, Representative Devin Nunes, the California Republican who chairs the House Intelligence Committee and is a member of President-elect Trump’s transition team, as well as the Gang of Eight, has called for a briefing for his entire committee on the CIA assessment, which the Washington Post reported on last week.“The committee is vigorously looking into reports of cyber-attacks during the election campaign, and in particular we want to clarify press reports that the CIA has a new assessment that it has not shared with us,” Nunes said.Representative Ron Johnson, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said his panel also has asked for a briefing but the CIA refused.“It is disappointing that the CIA would provide information on this issue to the Washington Post and NBC but will not provide information to elected members of Congress,” Johnson said in a statement on Friday.Three U.S. government sources, who all asked for anonymity to discuss classified information, told Reuters that the while the full congressional committees have not been briefed, the congressional leadership has, which is the standard procedure for briefing Congress on sensitive intelligence.The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said in a statement that because President Barack Obama last week ordered the intelligence community to conduct a full-scale “review of foreign efforts to influence recent presidential elections – from 2008 to the present,” the agencies would not comment further until the study is completed.BRIEFING TO FOLLOWODNI, which oversees all 16 U.S. intelligence agencies, said that when the review is complete, the U.S. intelligence community “stands ready to brief Congress.”The office said it also would make the study “available to the public consistent with protecting intelligence sources and methods.”The CIA based its conclusion about Russia hacking to influence the election not on irrefutable evidence but largely on its analysis of the fact that the Russians hacked both political parties while only publicizing information damaging to Democrats and their presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, said a fourth U.S. official familiar with the agency’s work.The FBI, which has responsibility for counterintelligence investigations inside the United States, did not endorse the CIA’s finding because it does not meet the standards of evidence necessary to win a conviction in a U.S. court or identify individuals whose hacking violated American law, the fourth official said.”The CIA’s case would never hold up in court but it is almost impossible to reach a different conclusion than the agency did based on the selective nature of what the Russians did and did not choose to publicize,” the official said.ODNI has not endorsed the CIA’s conclusion but does not dispute it. Two sources said there was “no daylight” between ODNI and CIA on the issue. An ODNI spokesman said the agency would not comment beyond its official statement.The debate over Russian hacking, which three officials said has continued after Election Day and extends beyond the election to multiple U.S. government agencies, as well as to private firms and individuals, also is opening a rift between Trump and some Republican members of Congress.The president-elect continues to dismiss the intelligence agencies’ conclusion that Russian President Vladimir Putin directed the hacking of this year’s election but Republicans such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, are calling for a full investigation.On Friday, Senator Richard Burr, Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, announced his committee will conduct a review in the new year of U.S. intelligence on Russian activities, including the classified information that led to the Obama administration’s Oct. 7 statement that Moscow was behind the hacking of U.S. political institutions.The review also will cover Russian cyber activity more broadly, he said in a statement.Burr said the review will include interviews of both Obama and Trump officials, “including the issuance of subpoenas if necessary to compel testimony.”(Reporting by Mark Hosenball; Editing by John Walcott and Bill Trott)"

It found that while religious views drive Americans’ skepticism of evolution, climate change denial is more dependent on conservative political views and a lack of confidence in the scientific community.The study, published by Rice sociologist Elaine Howard Ecklund and several other researchers, found that about 20 percent of U.S. adults are skeptical that climate change is occurring or that humans play a role in it. Roughly 45 percent of the U.S. population believes evolution to be false.Adherents of many religious traditions ― not including Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, and members of other “non-Western” traditions ― as well as those who said they attend more frequent religious services were more likely to be skeptical of evolution than are those with no religious affiliation.The only religion-related association the study found for climate skepticism was among evangelicals, who are more likely than the religiously unaffiliated to deny that climate change is occurring.“If we compared two politically conservative individuals, one of whom holds a creationist view and the other who does not, there is no reason to predict that the former would be more likely to be a climate change skeptic, unless the individual is an Evangelical Protestant,” the study states.A 2015 study by Pew Research Center found that 37 percent of white evangelicals ― more than any other Christian group or the religiously unaffiliated ― said there’s no solid evidence that the earth is getting warmer.In 2013, Pew found that 64 percent of white evangelical Protestants ― compared to 33 percent of the overall public ― believed that humans have existed in their present form since the beginning of time.In their report, Ecklund and fellow researchers suggested a path forward for concerned scholars, researchers and religious leaders who want to increase scientific literacy in religious communities.First, they said, it’s important to separate climate change skepticism from evolution skepticism, as the two are not always correlated. Next, science advocates should enlist the help of religious leaders to increase overall interest and confidence in the scientific community ― which will act to reduce skepticism about both evolution and climate change.“Science policy experts would do well to try to convince religious leaders of various types to advance science education and confidence in science among their constituents,” the study concludes."

Some of it may be explicit and publicized; some of it may not be.”Obama last met with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G-20 summit in September to discuss the cyberattacks.“He is well aware of my feelings, because I spoke to him directly about it,” he said.U.S. intelligence officials believe that Putin may have directly ordered the hack, according to NBC. On Thursday, NBC reported that government sources said that the Obama administration decided against responding to Russia before the election for fear of a cyber-war. The White House also did not want to appear to be intervening in the election and believed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton would win.Obama did not specify Thursday what actions he might take, citing an ongoing investigation. Earlier this month, he ordered a full intelligence probe of the matter, to be completed before he leaves office on Jan. 20. A bipartisan group of senators has also called for further scrutiny.The president would not confirm a recent CIA assessment that Russia directly intervened to help Trump, but he said that the hack had a definite effect on the election results.“There’s no doubt that it contributed to an atmosphere in which the only focus for weeks at a time, months at a time were Hillary’s emails, the Clinton Foundation, political gossip surrounding the DNC,” he said.Obama asserted that the Trump campaign amplified the cyberattacks to its advantage.“They understood what everybody else understood, which was that this was not good for Hillary Clinton’s campaign,” he said.In an interview with “The Daily Show” on Monday, Obama suggested that there were “very clear relationships between members of the president-elect’s campaign team and Russians, and a professed shared view on a bunch of issues.”Trump has denied the allegations, calling them “ridiculous” and “just another excuse.” This week, he falsely claimed that the hacks never came up until after the election, even though he himself brought them up on multiple occasions.“Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,” he said at a news conference in July, referring to Clinton’s emails from her private server."

Pat McCrory (R) has signed two bills that will drastically reduce the powers of his successor, incoming Democratic Governor-elect Roy Cooper. House Bill 17 and Senate Bill 4 were introduced by Republican lawmakers in the state legislature on Wednesday. Both bills passed in their respective chambers the following day by large margins. McCrory signed SB 4 on Friday and HB 17 on the following Monday. Critics view McCrory’s haste to sign the bills as a power grab by a bitter incumbent and his legislature. Cooper declared victory over McCrory on Nov. 9, but McCrory refused to concede the race because it was too close to call.Cooper was up by 4,300 votes on Election Day and continued to rise in the count. Instead of bowing out graciously, McCrory asked that all provisional ballots be counted, formally called for a statewide recount and made brash allegations of voter fraud before finally conceding on Dec. 5. HB 17 mandates that Cooper’s Cabinet picks receive approval from the Republican-dominated state Senate. It also bars Cooper from making any appointments to the University of North Carolina Board of Trustees or the state Board of Education.The bill will also greatly reduce the number of administrative employees in “exempt positions” Cooper can designate. “Exempt positions” are not subject to the same hiring and firing rules that govern other state employees.SB 4 takes aim at the North Carolina Board of Elections following several board decisions to extend voting hours in certain precincts in the Democratic stronghold of Durham County on Election Day. The bill will increase the number of Board of Elections members from five appointed by the governor to eight, split evenly along party lines. Cooper would appoint four of them, while two would be picked by the state House and another two by the state Senate. SB 4 also increases county election boards from three members ― two appointed by the sitting governor ― to four members, split along party lines. The bill could potentially undermine voting rights efforts in the state by requiring a 6-2 majority to move forward on any motions. The Board of Elections handles a number of questions related to election integrity. Cooper, who is currently the state attorney general, said he is willing to sue Republicans over these bills or any other potentially unconstitutional measures.“They will see me in court,” he said during a press conference on Thursday. “And they don’t have a very good track record there.”CORRECTION: Gov.

HBO is gearing up to release its latest limited series, “Big Little Lies,” which is already gaining attention after the trailer ran during “Westworld” showings this fall. And, according to Reese Witherspoon ― who stars in the series alongside Nicole Kidman, Shailene Woodley and Laura Dern ― we’re in for a wild ride come Feb. 19. The show follows a group of women whose children attend kindergarten together. But motherhood is far from the main focus of the show. “One of the grown-ups kills another grown-up, but you don’t know who. You know in the very beginning that one of us kills another one of us, but you don’t find out until the very end,” Witherspoon teased during an interview with The Huffington Post on AOL’s Build Series. “I just saw the end this week. It’s so good. It’s really ... scary. And real. It’s about these women, moms, who are viciously protective of their children, but also have a lot of secrets in their lives.”Her “Sing” co-star Matthew McConaughey was also present for the interview and discussed working with HBO on the mega-hit “True Detective.” “My experience working with HBO was outstanding,” he said. “As far as them [being] a production company, the way they dealt with us creatively, when they came in, when they stayed back. I had a wonderful experience with them as a studio.” Witherspoon credited McConaughey and Woody Harrelson with pioneering the run of limited series on major networks, and thinks the way viewers absorb content is only going to get more and more technical. “Matthew and Woody really broke that open,” she said. “Having these two amazing actors in that limited series really changed the way that people see television and content, really. It kind of blurred the lines, like, ‘Is this a movie? Or, what is this?’ And I think that’s sort of an interesting conversation that’s going on now in media and entertainment.” Witherspoon and McConaughey’s animated movie, “Sing,” hits theaters Dec. 21.

Since the 1950s, the rate at which carbon dioxide was accumulating in the atmosphere had climbed steadily. It surged from 0.75 parts per million per year in the 1950s to 1.86 ppm per year in 1989. But from 2002 to 2014, the rate stagnated, holding steady at around 1.9 ppm per year. (However, the overall concentration of atmospheric CO2 did rise over this period— just not as quickly as one might’ve expected it to.)A study published in Nature Communications last month suggests the reason for this is that as CO2 levels have risen, plants have been ramping up photosynthesis and, therefore, absorbing more carbon dioxide than usual.More photosynthesis has also meant more plants, which have in turn absorbed more CO2 and so on. For several years, this so-called “greening” of the planet is believed to have helped slow the rise of carbon in the atmosphere.“These results are very exciting,” lead author Trevor Keenan, an ecologist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, told PRI’s Living On Earth podcast in a December interview. “We’ve known for decades that ecosystems have been taking up a lot of the carbon dioxide we emit into the atmosphere. Now, they are not taking up near enough to really stop climate change, but they are slowing it down significantly.”Without the help of plants, the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide would be far higher than it is today, according to Keenan. In September, CO2 levels reached a daily average of above 400 parts per million for the first time in history. We’d already be at 460 ppm if not for the greening effect, a level “we don’t expect until about 2050 or 2060,” Keenan said.But researchers warn this effect is only temporary and will soon start to wane (if it hasn’t already). That’s because though plants take in carbon dioxide through photosynthesis, they also release CO2 through a process called respiration, which is sensitive to temperature increases. “So, as CO2 is going up, plants take more CO2 from the atmosphere,” Keenan told PRI. But as global temperatures rise, plants will “also release more CO2.”“We expect temperatures to continue to increase in the future and they already have over the past two years with the large El Nino event we’ve seen globally, and the net effect of this is a release of carbon dioxide,” Keenan added. “A lot of carbon goes into soils, and these soils are respiring ... [A]s temperature rises, that carbon that has been stored there could be released back into the atmosphere.”Ultimately, Keenan stressed that though the research offers “good news for now, we can’t expect it to continue,” he told The Washington Post. The study should, instead, serve as a reminder of how important it is to protect carbon sinks ― forests, oceans and other natural environments that help absorb CO2 from the atmosphere. Oceans and land plants help remove about 45 percent of the CO2 emitted by humans every year, according to a 2015 study. It should also be another wake-up call for people to immediately reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. “The growth of CO2 in the atmosphere continues to grow. And until we really cut our emissions, that’s what’s going to continue to happen,” Keenan told The Verge.“So plants are helping us out, they’re buying us time, but ultimately it’s up to us.”"
28,TECH,Yahoo Downplays Its Billion-Password Security Breach In Emails To Users,Adam Hooper,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/yahoo-lost-your-password_us_5852cd15e4b054eeaea218ea,Yahoo probably let attackers read your password.,2016-12-16,Yahoo says hackers stole the account information of over a billion accounts.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585325f11800002c00e42e87.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Yahoo is emailing at least some of the 1 billion users whose account information was hacked in 2013. Thursday’s email seems to imply that hackers didn’t acquire users’ passwords. That’s misleading.Here’s a portion of the email Yahoo sent users (emphasis ours):The stolen user account information may have included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords (using MD5) and, in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers. [...] The stolen information did not include passwords in clear text, payment card data, or bank account information.Let’s break it down. First, hackers accessed at least a billion “hashed” passwords (which look like “286755fad04869ca523320acce0dc6a4”); second, hackers did not access “clear-text” passwords (which look like “password”).Yahoo’s email refers to its web page, which says that “passwords that have been hashed can’t be reversed into the original plain text password.”This statement is misleading. There are plenty of tools online that quickly convert a hashed password into a plain text password.“I have to assume any guessable password was guessed quickly,” says Jeffrey Goldberg, who works for the password-management company 1Password. Goldberg estimates the hackers could have calculated 800 million to 900 million Yahoo usernames and passwords within weeks of the breach.So why does Yahoo claim hashed passwords can’t be reversed? Because it’s going with a very specific definition of “reverse.” For readers without math degrees, “you’re getting these two mixed messages,” says Goldberg. For password-security experts, you “know exactly what this means.”It means the attackers probably guessed most passwords very quickly.If Yahoo had “salted” users’ passwords ― a technical process that prevents passwords from being discovered on certain websites ― then reversing them would take far longer. Goldberg assumes Yahoo didn’t “salt” its passwords, because the company’s email doesn’t mention it.When asked Thursday, Yahoo refused to say whether it “salted” passwords in 2013. The company says it “salts” its passwords now, and it did when hackers stole 500 million users’ account information in 2014.The company is now disabling affected users’ accounts until they change their passwords.Goldberg suggests users go one step further: “If the password you used on Yahoo is used on any other service, you should assume it’s compromised there as well.”So ignore the top half of Yahoo’s email. Follow the instructions near the bottom:Change your passwords and security questions and answers for any other accounts on which you used the same or similar information used for your Yahoo account.

This is an understandable fear given how the Trump campaign blacklisted nearly a dozen outlets through much of the election. In addition to denying some news organizations press credentials, the campaign sometimes placed unusual restrictions on journalists once inside. During an interview with Fox News host Megyn Kelly, Spicer said Trump would not “bounce” reporters from the briefing room and “has a healthy belief in the First Amendment.”“If so healthy, why’d he ban them during the campaign?” Kelly responded. Spicer suggested there was a difference between denying access to the White House and events “paid for by the campaign” and held in “private” venues. Though reporters denied press credentials could often attend Trump rallies by entering with the general public, the campaign, at times, prevented ticket-holding journalists from doing so or removed them while they covered the event. “So if the New York Times does a scathing editorial on President Trump, they’re still going to let the New York Times reporters in the press briefing room and have access just the same as all the other news organizations,” Kelly asked. “They’re in the [press] pool right now and they still have scathing editorials and pretty poor reporting,” Spicer responded.“So yes, the answer to my question is yes?” she continued. “Yes,” Spicer said. “Absolutely.”Spicer, who served as communications director for the Republican National Committee during the campaign, is a top candidate for the press secretary job, along with the Daily Mail’s David Martosko and conservative radio host Laura Ingraham.Former Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said she turned down the job, though is expected to land a senior position in the administration. No matter who takes the job, it’s likely the incoming White House team will try to make changes when it comes to the traditional ways of engaging the press corps. Incoming White House chief of staff Reince Priebus said Wednesday that the Trump team is reassessing customs like the daily televised press briefing and seating arrangement (though the latter has traditionally been overseen by the White House Correspondents Association). On Fox News, Spicer said the new White House team has “to look at everything” when it comes to press briefings and suggested they may not need to be held daily or televised. “I think that’s a view shared by a lot of former White House press secretaries, a view by some in the media, in fact, that the White House press briefings have become somewhat of a spectacle,” he said.Mike McCurry, a White House press secretary under President Bill Clinton, has recently said that his decision to allow the briefings to be televised was a mistake. He suggested the briefings have become too much of a show” and also believes they should generally be embargoed until after completion. Spicer said Thursday that “maybe there’s a more effective way of delivering the news and having a more appropriate, adult conversation with the media to inform them of the candidate’s actions.”"
30,POLITICS,Yet Another Donald Trump Pick Has A Habit Of Spreading Dangerous Conspiracy Theories,Hayley Miller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-national-security-monica-crowley_us_58542a74e4b08debb788afc4,A history of peddling debunked theories won't guarantee you a spot in Trumpland -- but it apparently doesn't hurt.,2016-12-16,"Donald Trump and Ivanka Trump exit U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Camden, New Jersey, with David Friedman on Feb. 25, 2010.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585447691200005e0eeefc1c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President-elect Donald Trump announced Thursday that he’s chosen Fox News contributor Monica Crowley as the National Security Council’s senior director of strategic communications. If her conspiracy theory-pushing past is any indication, she’ll fit right in with several of Trump’s administration picks.Crowley promoted a debunked theory that Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin had ties to “Islamic supremacists” ― a claim proven false by The Washington Post, Snopes and other sources.A CNN report found Crowley repeatedly spread this phony information through various channels, including op-eds and guest appearances on radio shows and Fox News. In August, Crowley called Abedin’s parents “essentially tools of the Saudi regime” on Fox News’ “Hannity.” A month later, she wrote that Abedin’s family had “alleged ties to the Muslim Brotherhood” in a Washington Times piece.But Crowley’s unsubstantiated claims aren’t limited to targeting Abedin. She was a vocal proponent of the birther movement, often calling President Barack Obama’s citizenship into question. In 2008, she suggested Obama lied about his blackness. “[Obama is] not black African, he is Arab African,” she said on Laura Ingraham’s radio show. “And yet, this guy is campaigning as black and painting anybody who dares to criticize him as a racist. I mean that is — it is the biggest con I think I’ve ever seen.”Crowley isn’t the first Trump pick with a history of peddling conspiracy theories.David Friedman, whom Trump nominated as ambassador to Israel earlier this week, is another Abedin conspiracy theory believer. At an October rally in Jerusalem, he told the crowd that Abedin has “close connections to the Muslim Brotherhood.”And there’s Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, whom Trump tapped to be his top national security adviser. Flynn tweeted a fake news story in November on the #Pizzagate hoax, an absurd claim tying Clinton to a made-up underground child molestation ring based out of a Washington, D.C. pizza place named Comet Ping Pong.U decide - NYPD Blows Whistle on New Hillary Emails: Money Laundering, Sex Crimes w Children, etc...MUST READ! https://t.co/O0bVJT3QDr#Pizzagate inspired an armed man to fire his weapon inside the restaurant earlier this month (fortunately, no one was injured). When asked about his motives, the accused gunman cited the conspiracy theory, admitting that the “intel on this wasn’t 100 percent.”The Comet Ping Pong incident didn’t stop Flynn’s son, Michael Flynn Jr. ― then a member of Trump’s transition team ― from continuing to push the false claim a day later.Until #Pizzagate proven to be false, it’ll remain a story. The left seems to forget #PodestaEmails and the many “coincidences” tied to it. https://t.co/8HA9y30YfpWhile Flynn Jr. was fired from Trump’s transition for spreading fake news, Flynn Sr. quietly deleted the original tweet and held on to his national security position.And then, of course, there’s Trump himself, who claimed he’d witnessed thousands of New Jersey Muslims celebrate 9/11, accused the father of former presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) of playing a role in the assassination President John F. Kennedy, and gave the birther movement an unprecedented platform ― to name just a few of the conspiracy theories he’s peddled.The paranoia runs deep. But hey, it’s not like the misinformation is being shared by people deciding the fate of our national security or anything."
31,POLITICS,The 'Next Flint' Could Already Be Happening For 4 Million Americans,Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/drinking-water-lead-rural-utilities_us_585434a0e4b039044708516e,"A new analysis shows that utilities in small, rural communities are often skipping crucial tests of their water supplies.",2016-12-16,"Volunteers distribute water in Flint, Michigan. America's lead-contaminated water problem is likely bigger than we currently think it is, according to a new USA Today analysis.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585435a41800002c00e430a7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If you’re looking for the location of the “next Flint” water crisis, you might want to head to the countryside. That’s because small, rural and often poor communities are often served by utilities that either skip required tests for lead contamination in their water or are simply not equipped to properly carry out such testing.According to a thorough investigation published in a new piece by USA Today this week, about 4 million Americans find themselves in such a situation, drinking water that could be contaminated with lead but has not been properly vetted.The reporters’ findings, based on months of analysis of EPA and state records and more than 120 interviews with individuals who have discovered they’d been drinking water that is either lead-tainted or untested, are alarming.About 100,000 Americans are drinking water from utilities that are aware their water has high lead levels, but have delayed properly treating the water to ensure its safety, according to the analysis.Additionally, hundreds of small utilities have been getting away with a documented history of providing lead-tainted water, because regulators tend to be more flexible with oversight of these smaller utilities.The findings came as no surprise to Mae Wu, a water expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council. Many operators of systems serving just a few hundred water customers are typically working just part-time in their role and may not be properly trained.“The technical capabilities of these small systems are not what they are in larger drinking water systems,” Wu told HuffPost. “The people living in these communities are bearing the brunt of that problem.”Lead, a toxic metal, typically gets into drinking water when water service pipes containing lead corrode over time, often due to water that is highly acidic or has a low mineral content. It’s a big problem, considering the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says there is no safe level of lead exposure. Particularly in children, exposure to lead can affect IQ and academic achievement.In Coal Mountain, West Virginia, a very small, unincorporated area spotlighted by the USA Today report, the personification of that problem is 65-year-old retired coal miner Ravin Kenneda.According to the USA Today, Kenneda’s treatment regimen for the community’s water supply — accessed through a wellhead housed inside a shed near church property — consists solely of “pour[ing] bleach into his community’s water once in a while to keep it clean.”That doesn’t appear to be doing the trick, as the Coal Mountain water system has been the subject of 19 water-testing violations since 1988, more than any other water system in the nation. And state officials told USA Today that they can’t do much about it because Coal Mountain, like 15 other utilities in the state, is an “orphan system” with no official owner or operator.While Coal Mountain is an extreme example, many other small water systems find themselves in a similarly difficult position — with few resources at their fingertips to keep up with the water quality standards laid out by the Environmental Protection Agency.According to the EPA, about 84 percent of the nation’s 53,000 drinking water utilities serve 3,300 or fewer customers. Large utilities serving more than 10,000 customers represent about 7 percent of the nation’s total community water systems but serve the bulk (about 80 percent) of the nation’s water customers overall.This tends to concentrate resources and technical knowhow among larger utilities, though smaller utilities can turn to non-profit groups like the Rural Community Assistance Partnership for technical assistance in treating their water and operating their systems, Wu noted.Still, the work of organizations like RCAP can only go so far given how expansive the problem is. And that is particularly true considering that analyses like the USA Today’s primarily focused on just one contaminant, lead. The EPA also regulates dozens of other water contaminants.So the nation’s lead-in-water problems, then, are really just a small sliver of the challenges facing its water supply,“In rural areas, you might have nitrates, pesticides and all other kinds of things that could also be in the water. It’s not just lead,” Wu said. “This could just be the tip of the iceberg.”―-Joseph Erbentraut covers promising innovations and challenges in the areas of food and water.

As the images of your affliction and dire need flood my timeline my mind begins to wonder “But by the grace of God go I.” This morning as I went about my daily routine of getting my children off to school my spirit was overcome with a complex combination of guilt and profuse empathy.“There’s a crippling amount of culpability that comes with silence” was the unceasing mantra that played in my mind on the drive home, not knowing what to do I began to write you a letter. What did you do this morning? I pondered. How did you sleep? Did your children get any rest? (I dare not ask about their mental state as I can imagine the trauma they’ve endured). With every simple question I began to cry, as the mere thought of your reality was too much for me to even fathom, disgusting I know.I prayed for you, for your family, and for your unwavering strength.It was in that moment that I came across 7-year-old Aleppo resident Bana Alabed’s Twitter feed, Bana and her mother have been using the social media platform to share their story. Scrolling further down her page I came across a post that featured young Bana reading. Reading during war?I imagined you having to maintain a homelike atmosphere in an impossible circumstance. Creating distractions when there are bombs or reading to your child during short periods of bone chilling silence. Yet I know that the ability to manifest the illusion of safety is carried in the arsenal of every mothers war chest. We never let our children see us fearful and though we are separated by many miles I would be remiss to indulge in the notion that we are not the same. We may not share the same religion but I believe with you, we may not have the same children but I carried beside you and we may not be standing in a war zone together but it is my duty to utilize every opportunity and western privilege to stand for you. Therefore I STAND WITH THE MOTHERS OF ALEPPO.As mothers embedded in the fabric of our genetic makeup there is the ornate necessity to protect our children. Also as mothers we belong a to an elite sisterhood of women who have brought forth and protected life for generations that stated, there’s strength in numbers. William Ross Wallace once penned a poem entitled ""The Hand That Rocks the Cradle Is the Hand That Rules the World"" and it is in that same spirit that I humbly impress upon the immediate action of every mother throughout our global community, to stand up and denounce the incessant violence against the women and children of Syria.It is my promise to you dear sister, to set aside all personal political views and speak out against the heinous atrocities you and your children have sustained. Just hours ago I watched a video made by a Syrian orphanage which shows a child pleading to the international community. 47 children, parentless asking for our help. ""We are scared of the airstrikes ... Please get us out of Aleppo. We want to live like everyone else,"" 10-year-old Yasmeen Qanouz said while his voice quivered.  Are these not our children? I asked myself.Alone I am just one but it is my sincere wish to stand along side many others and declare loudly “ We Stand With The Mothers of Aleppo.” Continued efforts will be made in your names, through the utilization of social media and ceaseless attempts to contact our elected officials petitioning them to condemn the violence in Syria and donating to relief organizations. No longer are your cries unheard “We hear you Mothers of Aleppo” and together we stand with you.Sincerely,Your Sister in Motherhood#IStandWithTheMothersOfAleppo"

Perry:Welcome to the Department of Energy. It is a cornucopia of scientific wonders, brilliant people and, to be true, some duplication and wasted effort.Oil, natural gas and coal are not the overriding concern of the DOE. Until President Jimmy Carter created it in 1977, fossil fuels were the province of the Department of the Interior.The DOE was preceded by the Energy Research and Development Administration. This was a short-lived agency that combined the non-regulatory functions of the Atomic Energy Commission with the Federal Energy Administration, a policy coordinating body.To be sure, DOE has had a manful role in coal gasification, fracking and carbon capture and storage.But its main role is to be the nation’s armorer; to build and maintain the U.S. stockpile of nuclear weapons, and to detect bad guys testing weapons in places like North Korea and Iran.The department has 17 major laboratories, headed by the three big weapons labs: Los Alamos, Sandia and Lawrence Livermore.In your own state of Texas, as you must know, is the Pantex facility. That is where the weapons are constructed and dismantled. That is ground zero, if you will, of weapons making. That where the “pits” are assembled and disassembled. Weapons are designed and engineered in the weapons laboratories.You will find that cleanup of nuclear waste — much of it from earlier weapons production — in places like Hanford, Wash., and Los Alamos, N.M., is a continuing and seemingly endless task that chews up talent and money.Some of the other work of the DOE may surprise you. It was a major player in the human genome project and it helps U.S. companies improve their manufacturing technology. It has developed ceramics for all sorts of non-nuclear uses, like car engines. Its work with 3-D seismic and advanced drill bits has made the fracking revolution possible.You are, in fact, about to lead the largest science department anywhere in the world.When you get the feel of the place, one hopes that talk of disbanding it will disappear. Likewise wild talk about rooting out climate science, which has the department in shock. The DOE is not part of some climate science conspiracy. Please examine your charge before you trash it.The DOE national laboratory system is a national treasure, the science mind of the nation. It collaborates with dozens of universities.If President-elect Trump is determined to renegotiate the Iranian deal, you will be a player. The present secretary, Ernie Moniz, handled the negotiations brilliantly for the treaty we have with Iran. He knew as much about the workings of a hydrogen bomb and its supply chain as his opponent, Ali Akbar Salehi, who also went to MIT. If there is another negotiation as the president-elect has suggested, you will have to support the chief negotiator, the secretary of state, with expertise from your department.First and foremost, the DOE is a nuclear agency, charged with making the weapons that protect the nation. But it also does some amazingly disparate things at its labs, from improving coal combustion to studying cancer to examining the very nature of matter. And, of course, climate science. It has been said that it takes a new secretary a year to find out what the department does.Because the DOE operates in many states through the laboratory system, Congress rides it hard. Congressmen fight for dollars and projects in their states. An example — and one you will have to adjudicate — is the battle over whether to continue with the construction and operation of the mixed oxide fuel fabrication facility at the Savannah River Site. The Obama administration has said it should be terminated; Congress says no.As there is throughout government, there is waste in the lab system. But it is a small problem compared with its huge value to the nation. A suggestion: work on making it even more user friendly to technology transfer. That is how we assure the future of U.S. competitiveness: science and more science.You have a great charge, Gov. Perry, and it has very little to do with oil."

At the very moment I passed the doorway, two men tumbled out, one black, the other white.The African American man exclaimed, “Don’t call me a [insert n-word]!” He then punched the white guy. It was a hard hit, making a solid “thwack” and causing a nose bleed.“But I didn’t,” the Caucasian man protested. Since I had missed the crucial instant before the incident, I have no means to determine the facts. I would not make any assumption about who was telling the truth. Any speculation would reveal only my own predisposition. Each of them might well trust his own version of events.Ten years ago in Detroit, an hour east of Ann Arbor, I was at the Renaissance Center. The Brutalist fortress of an office complex downtown, mirrored glass cylinders and concrete bunkers, was the site of a fancy wedding as well as a tattoo festival. The guests at the former were primarily black people, dressed in formal, lavish, impressive outfits. They were clean-cut, dignified, and radiated a sense of the festive occasion. The attendees at the latter were an exclusively white crowd, clad in leather, such as vests and chaps that were studded but skimpy. They were the opposite of clean-cut and dignified, though they were festive in their own fashion.When I was riding up an elevator with representatives of both proceedings, including black women attired in ball gowns, an emaciated white gentleman lit up a cigarette. The rest of us backed away ever so slightly as he filled the car with smoke, but nobody said a word. I thought to myself, if you had shown up from Mars, or, for that matter, China, you would have an interesting snapshot image of America. I could not have made up a better contrast to conventional suspicions.Not too long after that, I was driving after dark along Woodward Avenue, the major thoroughfare running from downtown to the suburbs, and I stopped at a service station to fill the tank. You cannot be certain on the desolate streets of the Motor City what businesses you will be able to find. (Shortly after moving back home after twenty years away, I was looking to buy a pair of socks, and I was told the store that sold socks was closed. When I inquired when it would open, the reply was, no, it had closed permanently the year before.)As I stood at the self-serve pump, I noticed that the one other customer was smoking, the cigarette dangling from his mouth. A service station would seem to be an inauspicious place to be doing that. I would have taken it as given that everyone would be informed about the risk of fire associated with vast quantities of gasoline. Enough movies depict the conflagration.Yet it felt unwise to point out the problem to someone who appeared indifferent to his own potentially imminent death. As I drove away, relieved to distance myself from the potential disaster, I wondered if I had been reluctant to shout out my concern because the fellow was black. He was middle-aged and otherwise non-descript.I share these accounts to ask what I — what we — should make of them, in isolation or taken together. I have tried to record these vignettes as accurately as possible, without any judgment of any individual save myself. Perhaps these experiences, other than the one that involved an express allegation about race (according to one aggrieved party), have nothing to do with race at all. Or perhaps they reflect and signal attitudes, fears, and impulses, both spoken and unspoken.Recently a stranger who contacted me for a professional referral addressed me by the wrong name. Although she was “horrified,” since she had confused me with someone else of Asian descent, I assured her I had been called worse.As kids say, I told her, “No worries.”When I was growing up in Detroit, my family among the few “Orientals” to be seen, I used to hear often enough, “You all look alike.” The people who said that then were annoyed rather than apologetic. They could not be bothered to tell us apart.People no longer say that, even as a quip. When I repeat it, “No worries, we all look alike,” listeners hesitate, trying to decide if I am being ironic and if they ought to laugh. (I am acquainted with not one but two Asian American lawyers who could pass, to the ignorant eye, for Judge Lance Ito, the Japanese American who presided over the O.J. Simpson “trial of the century” racial morality play. I am pretty sure they have messed with folks who believe they have sighted a celebrity.)I have been mistaken in print, for example, for the late Chinese dissident Harry Wu. The two of us, who had not even met, visited an Ivy League school to give speeches, back-to-back. A critic somehow had the idea we were the same person. My hosts were embarrassed.Yet once when I was teaching, I committed the same error. I was a visiting professor at a school where I was not known to the students, nor they to me. Despite the seating chart in front of me, I called on one of the two Asian American males enrolled in the class, who was not responsive, until he realized, before I did, that he was not the other man, who was absent that day. “Of all the people to do that, I didn’t figure it would be you,” he said afterward, not as peeved as he could have been. I was relieved he had a sense of humor, especially since I had been irate over his failure to answer the question. So I am persuaded, by my own guilt if nothing else, that too much sensitivity does not serve us well. I m willing to give, and to accept, a pass for the first gaffe. It is the pattern that emerges, which matters. There are phenomenon that can be explained only by race, unless they are to be interpreted as meaningless. To take offense at every slight is exhausting; better to be concerned with what represents the start along a spectrum of attitudes that lead to actions, showing escalating hostility. There is a range, a scale, and identifying everything as morally equivalent renders it incoherent. There hardly be denial though. Race has been the basis for granting and denying privileges and protections. Social systems have been organized with race as the foundation. Jobs, homes, seats on buses, the right to vote, welfare benefits, entry into the country, physical safety walking down the street, and much else has depended on color of skin. Life outcomes vary by race, from infant mortality rates to health care options. Slavery and war, and slavery that inspired war, have been all about race. These are not trivial matters. They do not spring forth at the extremes.When people deny that what they have said or done is racist, they are expressing a range of refusals. For them, and those who would accuse them, subtlety is as necessary as it is difficult. The putative non-racist might mean that they do not acknowledge that an action or policy is related to race. It has a legitimate basis. They are not reacting to someone who is black. They are shunning someone who is criminal. The problem, for objective observers, is that it is clear they have rendered black as criminal, or they have treated the black criminal as a worse — for blacks, a transgression is a felony; for whites, the same, a misdemeanor.Or they might be implying that their racial assumption is of no great consequence. It is what lawyers would deem “de minimus.” Only the politically correct, intolerant-of-intolerance type would bother even to remark upon the matter. It is as if to say “So what?” To call Asian Americans as a group “polite” or compliment them on their English, to ask where they are “really” from after they have already declared where they are from or how they like it in this country, it is all in the spirit of casual chit-chat.The most robust rebuttals contain the claim that the racial generalization is justified, because it is accurate or at least plausible, and the circumstances do not allow for deliberate investigation about each individual and her propensities. Whether it is biology, culture, or merely probabilities, there is nothing wrong with a government program that targets African Americans as criminals or Japanese Americans during World War II as spies, saboteurs, and traitors. The line of reasoning may run from identity to conduct, but inferences are warranted.The crux of the issue is whether it is possible to be racial without being racist. If all racial references are prohibited, they are all equal in the abstract. The point is that racial bias is not the same as sports team rivalries, innocent pridefulness and mutual heckling.If we were aware of what was happening around us, and within our own consciousness, we would recognize that race, if not racism, is pervasive and inescapable. We are all implicated in its influence. We are compelled to pay attention to it. But we become anxious, angry, defensive, uncomfortable as soon as race is called out. We exhaust ourselves, as individuals and as a community such as it is. We lack good will and common interest.That is why I would like to show that we need not have such trouble even talking about race. "

Trump did wind up winning narrowly in three key states, allowing him to defeat Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.Recent reports say that U.S. intelligence agencies are now confident that Russian leaders were trying to help Trump. NBC News reported Thursday that Russian leader Vladimir Putin personally was involved in that effort.Kerry declined to respond to that latest twist. He pointed out, though, that Obama did take action, weeks ahead of the election.“We sat in the Situation Room, I remember, in the White House, with the president of the United States, and the president made the decision, based on the input that was carefully, carefully vetted by the intelligence community and presented to everybody, that he did have an obligation to go out to the country and give a warning, and he did so,” Kerry said.“Back in October, the president authorized the director of national intelligence and the Department of Homeland Security together to make a very clear statement to this nation, to our nation. And they said unequivocally that they assessed with high confidence ― that’s what we said in October ― with high confidence, that the Russian government directed comprises of emails from U.S. institutions, including political organizations, and that these thefts and disclosures were intended to interfere with our election process.”Trump has rejected that assessment, going as far as to theorize at a debate that U.S. intelligence agencies had no idea who had hacked emails from Democrats and given them to Wikileaks, which was releasing them daily in the final weeks of the campaign. “I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, okay?” Trump said.Both Trump and his campaign continue that stance today. Spokesman Jason Miller responds to queries about the matter by calling the discussion an attempt to delegitimize Trump’s victory.Trump himself tweeted Thursday morning: “If Russia, or some other entity, was hacking, why did the White House wait so long to act? Why did they only complain after Hillary lost?”"

37,POLITICS,Labor Secretary Tom Perez Jumps Into The Race For DNC Chair,Sam Stein and Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tom-perez-dnc_us_5852e997e4b012849c05fe9a,"Suddenly, the race has some serious drama.",2016-12-15,"President Barack Obama is reportedly backing his labor secretary, Tom Perez, for DNC chair.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5852e9bc120000c40beef83f.jpeg?cache=fq4HIKjrQU&ops=crop_8_0_3492_2037%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Tom Perez, President Barack Obama’s labor secretary, announced on Thursday that he was entering the race for chair of the Democratic National Committee, transforming a relatively sleepy contest into a pitched battle about the future of the party. “We have a lot of fighting to do. We have a lot of advocating to do. And I’ve been doing that all my life,” Perez said on a call announcing his decision. “We are really in the battle for the future of America. And given what happened last month, I don’t think there has ever been a point in my life where the position of chair of the Democratic Party has ever been more important.”In throwing his name out for chair, Perez complicates what had seemed like a smooth path to the position for Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.). Ellison was the favorite in a race featuring South Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Jamie Harrison and New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman Ray Buckley, primarily because he had the support of numerous luminaries in the party ― both in Congress and in the influential labor community.But party officials close to Obama have worried that Ellison’s brand of unflinching liberalism (both on foreign and domestic policy), and his relative inexperience in building party infrastructure, make him a risky choice to lead a party in exile.Perez is hardly an old hand when it comes to Democratic party-building either, though he emphasized on the call that his focus at the DNC would be on revitalizing a 50-state strategy for the party, strengthening its grassroots organizing and empowering “state and local leadership.”“The party needs strong progressive leadership that can deliver results for all Americans,” he said. “I think I could make a difference, because I’m a proud progressive and I’ve been getting stuff done throughout my career.”Prior to running for DNC chair, Perez worked in the Senate and President Bill Clinton’s administration and served in Maryland state politics before leading the Justice Department’s powerful civil rights division during the Obama administration. In 2013, he took over the Labor Department, where he earned respect within the White House and the admiration of officials outside of it for pushing through regulations that expanded overtime pay and bolstered workplace conditions. He was also on the front line of efforts to increase the minimum wage.Indeed, the ideological gap between him and Ellison is not particularly vast. They differ most notably in their respective positions on Obama’s pursuit of a Pacific trade pact, which Perez supported and Ellison opposed.Ellison called Perez “a great public servant” Thursday and said he welcomed him to the race. “I look forward to discussing how Democrats can speak to all Americans, harness the grassroots to turn out the vote, and strengthen our state and local parties,” the congressman said in a statement.Where the race will be waged, observers predict, is on matters of style, not substance ― with the main dispute over whether the party tries to duplicate Obama’s electoral success or adopts a more combative, unapologetic approach. Ellison was an enthusiastic booster of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the Democratic presidential primary (Perez supported former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton). And many Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), are eager to keep that faction of the party content and inside leadership circles. Ellison’s candidacy certainly seems to share DNA with Sanders. His DNC platform calls for making “labor a full partner” with Democrats. He also emphasizes relying on small-dollar fundraising over big-money donors. One Democratic state party chair backing Ellison said that while they respected Perez, they liked that Ellison already had experience turning out new voters, raising money and understanding what’s going on in the Midwest. The fact that Sanders likes Ellison, this official added, certainly doesn’t hurt.“Having Bernie Sanders’ endorsement? Absolutely that’s important, because there are a lot of people that love Bernie who are watching what he’s suggesting. And Bernie’s really making a difference and being a great voice for our party,” the official said. However, they emphasized that many Clinton supporters are also backing Ellison.Ellison’s defenders often note that he is one of the few elected officials to have walked picket lines with union activists or voiced his disagreements with Obama administration policy ― and his supporters believe this is precisely the reason Obama allies encouraged Perez to run. One Democrat supportive of the congressman’s bid said this is “about the White House picking whatever horse they feel can defeat Ellison.”Perez seemed to acknowledge this line of criticism during Thursday’s call, conceding that members might be wondering, “Is this another guy from Washington who is trying to talk the talk but hasn’t walked the walk?”But his support isn’t limited to Obama allies (though several of them tweeted their excitement with the news of his announcement). On Thursday’s call, he was joined by several state party chairs who praised his past work in Maryland and his capacity as an effective communicator.Perez, who was often discussed as a potential gubernatorial candidate in Maryland, said he made the decision to pursue the party post instead because of the weight of the political moment. He said he was not interested in using the DNC job as a stepping stone to political office in Maryland, because he believes the chair post is “a full-time job.”“I really believe this is one of those ‘Where were you?’ moments on our nation’s journey to form a more perfect union,” he said. “We must resist the Trump agenda, because it’s a scary agenda.” Want more updates from Amanda Terkel?

Again. The city announced on Wednesday night that a back-flow incident in its industrial district had possibly contaminated drinking water with an “unknown chemical substance.” (Update: On Sunday, city officials announced the lifting of the water ban.)Officials said Thursday during a news conference that the chemical had been identified as Indulin AA86, an asphalt emulsifier, the Corpus Christi Caller-Times reported.As a result, the city is telling its more than 320,000 residents to not use its tap water at all — to avoid using it to prepare food, shower or wash dishes or clothes — until advised otherwise. The city called on residents to use bottled water instead, which has caused many stores to sell out of water. Classes at area schools were also canceled Thursday as a result of the water ban.Officials expect results from a water test to come back on Thursday afternoon, according to the city’s website, and they are currently considering water distribution options.On Friday, the city issued an update indicating that some outlying areas of the city, as indicated on a map the city had posted to its website, can resume drinking and using tap water. The city’s water was cleared for limited use — including bathing, showering and washing clothes — in a second area identified on the map, while the water ban remains in effect for a third area closest to the coast.The city tweeted that, as of Friday, it is still awaiting state regulators’ water sample test results to determine next steps.Residents took to Twitter to document long lines of customers who rushed to buy water. Water issues have plagued the city over the last couple of years. In May, residents were advised to boil their tap water before drinking it for a 13-day period. Similar advisories had been issued in July and September 2015.The water problems prompted then-City Manager Ron Olson to resign. The scandal was also cited as a major contributing factor in the defeat of former Mayor Nelda Martinez in November, as hundreds of residents had previously sought to recall her due to the water issues.The current issue is a bit different because it involves a local company and less blame falls on the city itself. Environmental activist Erin Brockovich was in close contact with city officials during the previous water problems, and told The Huffington Post on Thursday that the city is “doing everything they can to isolate the contamination.”The city has been cooperative in addressing both its prior issues with their water system and the current incident, she said. “People are beyond frustrated and they have every right to be,” Brockovich said. “It’s a scary scenario, a sad scenario.”The most important takeaway, she added, is for residents heed the city’s advice to not drink their water. City officials ― including Dan Grimsbo, Corpus Christi’s interim director of water and utilities ― did not immediately respond to requests for comment.―-Joseph Erbentraut covers promising innovations and challenges in the areas of food and water.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5852ed641c00000a070ebc59.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Here at HuffPost Parents, we celebrate parenthood in all its forms, including the beauty of motherhood in the animal kingdom. Which is why we were so excited to hear about Mei the pregnant orangutan, who resides at Cameron Park Zoo in Waco, Texas. The mammal is currently busy riding out her pregnancy in style, complete with (multiple) baby showers and a gift registry at Target. Mei and the baby’s father, KJ, were brought to Cameron Park Zoo in 2009 to be a breeding pair, according to orangutan trainer Laura Klutts. “Orangutans are the first great ape in danger to go extinct, so the expectation of a baby is super exciting,” Klutts told The Huffington Post. “They also have the longest interbirth period of any land mammal ― so you only get a baby about every 7-9 years and that’s if the stars align and you are lucky enough to have no other conditions or issues.”Mei’s pregnancy was planned and she was taken off birth control in 2015. The breeding and pregnancy was then observed and monitored by keepers.18-year-old Mei and 28-year-old KJ are expecting their baby at the end of January. In the meantime, Laura and the other primate keepers asked to do the registry and shower for the public to attend. “Everyone is very invested in the excitement of a new little one on its way. We wanted a way to give everyone a chance to come out and celebrate with the zoo and the parents to be,” Klutt said. Two of Mei’s keepers actually went to the local Target to register items for Mei and KJ, all of which had been pre-approved as safe for the animals to interact with. The registry includes bedding and feeding items, bath items like towels and baby shampoo, toys, picture books and even a GoPro action cam, presumably to document Mei and KJ’s parenthood journey. There are also some seemingly funny items on the list, including music from Simon and Garfunkel and Dolly Parton, DVDS of “The Princess Bride” and “Casper” and Britney Spears’ Fantasy fragrance. Klutts admits that Mei can’t tell her keepers what her favorite music is, so the animals will listen to a wide variety. (Dolly Parton was Klutts’ pick.)Mei doesn’t have a special affinity for Britney Spears either ― the keepers spray different kinds of scents around the animals’ enclosures and habitats to add sensory variation. Kutts adds, however: “Who knows, maybe Mei will love the Britney fragrance. It was purchased off the registry, so we will absolutely be letting her test it out!”The zoo has received a huge outpouring of response from across the country, and they are getting multiple packages delivered from Target daily, including 17 on Wednesday alone. While many of the items on Mei’s registry have already been purchased, there are still some items available, and the zoo itself also has its own wishlist on Amazon.Mei and KJ will open some of their presents at their baby shower this weekend, where keepers will have decorations in the enclosure and cake for guests, and will answer questions from the public. The zoo has actually added a second shower due to inclement weather which will mean celebrants can only view Mei and KJ through a window at the first celebration.The photo above is from Mei’s first baby shower in 2014. She and KJ’s first son Batari passed away at 6 months old, but they were “both great parents,” according to Klutts. Once Mei gets closer to her birth window, she will be under 24/7 watch and monitored for labor complications, with the zoo’s veterinarian and OB-GYN standing by and local hospitals and a neonatal team in place as back-up if assistance is needed. According to the zoo’s Facebook, their pair of pelicans, who were rescued from an oil spill, also have an egg together which will also hatch in January, so spring is in the air at one zoo in Texas at least.

41,POLITICS,Supreme Court Foreshadows Big Constitutional Ruling In Immigration Case,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-immigration-order_us_58530cfce4b0b3ddfd8bd8de,An unusual order indicates that the justices may not be willing to split 4-to-4.,2016-12-15,Is the incoming Trump administration on the justices' minds? Only time will tell.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58530d9e120000c40beef8ae.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Supreme Court on Thursday issued a highly unusual order in a pending immigration case that could limit President-elect Donald Trump’s powers to detain certain noncitizens who may be eligible to be removed from the country.The court heard the case ― a class-action challenge brought by thousands of immigrants, many of whom are in the U.S. legally, who were kept in detention without a real opportunity to vouch for their release in front of a judge ― last month, and the justices appeared deeply torn over how to rule.Federal law grants immigration authorities broad leeway to detain foreign-born people if they are apprehended at the border or have criminal backgrounds. The high court’s task was to determine what limits, if any, exist for that grant of authority. The new order asks lawyers for the federal government and the American Civil Liberties Union to file a new round of legal briefs addressing whether the Constitution would require a hearing in front of a judge ― or even a release, if the government fails to present strong enough evidence that the person shouldn’t be released ― if a detention lasted six months.Like others in his class, the lead plaintiff in the case, Alejandro Rodriguez, was detained for three years without a hearing, even though he was a lawful permanent resident facing deportation over two minor offenses, a drug charge and joyriding as a teenager.At the hearing in November, the Supreme Court’s more conservative members didn’t seem willing to touch this constitutional issue. Instead, they seemed to be opting for a narrower ruling based on current immigration law and a prior appeals ruling that resolved the case in favor of the detainees.“We do not have the constitutional issue before us,” Justice Anthony Kennedy warned Ahilan Arulanantham, the ACLU lawyer who argued the case. The justice authored a concurring opinion in an earlier immigration dispute that’s key to resolving the present controversy.Kennedy is believed to have played a role in a similarly strange order earlier this year, which called for additional briefing in a high-stakes case pitting religious liberty against contraceptive coverage under the Affordable Care Act. In that case, decided a few months after Justice Antonin Scalia’s death, the court ended up punting the issue without a clear resolution.Similar forces may be at play here, and the justices may be signaling a desire to not split 4-to-4 in a case that could directly implicate the authority of the incoming Trump administration in an area that was a linchpin in the president-elect’s campaign. ""I think it's really hard to read the tea leaves here,"" said Arulanantham, a recent MacArthur Foundation fellow, in an interview. He added that the justices' move on Thursday suggests ""the court wasn't yet satisfied with either party's position."""

Evancho has long been in the public eye, coming in as the runner-up on “America’s Got Talent” when she was just 10 years old. But more recently, she and her family have been getting national attention as well for their fight for transgender equality.Jackie Evancho’s sister Juliet is one of three transgender students suing a Pennsylvania school district over its rule that students must use the restroom that corresponds with their anatomical or biological sex.They are currently asking a federal judge to force the school to allow them to use restrooms corresponding to their gender identity until the case is heard by the court or settled.Juliet was born Jacob, and in a new piece for “Teen Vogue,” she says she slowly began to tell people about her gender identity as her family was increasingly under the microscope due to Jackie’s fame: My mom was the first person I told, although she already suspected it. She simply smiled at me, told me she loved me, and said she’d always be there for me. I then told my sister Jackie. She too was not at all surprised and was very supportive and happy that I found my true self, but at the same time she was terrified about the potential ridicule I’d face for the rest of my life. Finally, I told my dad. My dad took it the hardest, and I couldn’t blame him, even if it hurt me a lot. He tried to hide it, but I could tell. He was, after all, losing his oldest son. Not just his, but the son that had his name as a middle name. My youngest siblings Zach and Rachel were a little too young to fully understand, but I told them, too. Not even my best friends knew the real me. Everyone just assumed I was a feminine gay boy.Jackie told local Pittsburgh TV station KDKA in May that she was incredibly proud of her sister’s courage. “The Evancho family is under the microscope enough as it is,” she said. “And for her to come out is just really hard. But she’s so brave and I’m proud of her for that.”A representative for Evancho did not return a request for comment.Under President Barack Obama, federal agencies like the Department of Justice and the Department of Education have been allies in the fight for transgender equality. A handful of states are currently suing the administration over its guidance to schools that if they receive federal funding, they must “treat a student’s gender identity as the student’s sex for purposes of the law.” Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R), the incoming vice president and a long-time opponent of LGBTQ equality, has made clear that in the next administration, the federal government will not be stepping in and fighting for these rights. In October, he told The Christian Post that the matter should be left to individual schools: “Washington has no business intruding on the operation of our local schools.”In April, Trump said he was fine with letting transgender people use whatever restroom they feel most comfortable with, but he later said he supported a North Carolina law that banned them from doing just that.Want more updates from Amanda Terkel?

Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) convened his own hearing on Donald Trump's conflicts of interest after Republicans refused to hold official hearings.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5852e6fa1800002d00e42d81.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Even though they hold no committee gavels in their hands and no subpoena power to command witnesses to testify, House Democrats are going to try and provide oversight of the Trump administration whether Republicans want to or not.On Wednesday, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), ranking member on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, showed what that would look like. In a meeting room in the Capitol Visitor Center, Cummings and four other Democrats ― Reps. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), John Sarbanes (D-Md.) and Del. Stacey Plaskett (D-V.I.) ― convened a hearing with three ethics experts to examine President-elect Donald Trump’s conflicts of interest.Those called to testify included Norm Eisen, ethics advisor to President Barack Obama and former ambassador to the Czech Republic, Richard Painter, ethics advisor to President George W. Bush, and Stephen Gillers, professor at New York University School of Law.Connolly, the ranking Democrat on the oversight committee’s Government Operations Subcommittee, charged the witnesses with answering a question underlies every property the president-elect owns or holds a licensing deal with across the globe: “What could go wrong with that?” Since Trump’s election, there have been numerous examples.Just look at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. What could go wrong with that? Well, the just-opened hotel invited foreign governments to book rooms for their diplomats to curry favor with the new regime.Or Trump’s licensing deal with his Turkish business partners for the Trump Tower Istanbul. What could go wrong with that? Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is demanding that the U.S. extradite the Turkish cleric Fetthulah Gulen, whom he accuses of promoting the failed 2016 coup. Trump’s reliance on the good graces of the autocratic Erdogan to maintain his profits in Turkey is a conflict.The same goes for Trump’s business ties to the Philippines, where his name sits on a new tower in the city of Makati. What could go wrong with that? Trump has praised the murderous rule of President Rodrigo Duterte ― who has appointed Trump’s business partner, Jose E.B. Antonio, as the country’s official trade representative to the United States.These obvious conflicts between Trump’s business and his coming role as head of state have been a major subject of controversy since his election on Nov. 8, yet the president-elect has no apparent plan to disentangle himself from his multi-billion dollar business.While the president is not subject to the federal conflict of interest statute that requires presidential appointees to separate themselves from financial holdings that could create a conflict with their official duties, every president since the 1978 ethics legislation became law has behaved as though it does. So far, Trump has not.This has been a concern for the minority Democrats (and one Republican). Cummings first asked Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, for a full committee hearing to discuss the issue on Nov. 14. Chaffetz did not respond. Cummings followed up again on Nov. 28 and, again, did not hear back.“We were left with no option but to hold today’s hearing ourselves, although we invited our Republican colleagues to attend,” Cummings said.The witnesses all agreed that there needs to be action on Trump’s potential conflicts of interest before he takes office. They also discussed existing ethics laws and constitutional provisions that Trump’s business holdings could violate ― most glaringly, the Constitution’s Emoluments Clause, which forbids U.S. government officials from receiving payment or any benefit from a foreign government.“One of the most grave threats to American democracy is the infiltration of our government by foreign powers,” Painter said. “The founders worried about this. They worried about France and England and Russia and other countries that would seek to influence the United States government.”He noted another provision in the Constitution built on the same principle: the requirement that the president be a natural-born citizen. “We heard a lot about that one over the past several years,” he said, “and the demand, I thought quite frankly, both embarrassing and racist, that suggested that President Barack Obama was not a natural born citizen.”Trump reportedly owes millions of dollars to the government-owned Bank of China, and thus could be violating the Emoluments Clause once he takes office. Further, his Trump International Hotel in Washington has already become a hot spot for foreign governments to spend money.Emoluments could include favorable action by foreign governments beyond simple payments or gifts, Eisen argued. “I believe it can include permits,” he said. “It can include trademarks … Anything of benefit from a foreign government that might distort a judgment.”Past presidents have had significant conflicts of interest that affected both domestic and foreign policy in extremely negative ways, Painter noted.The most obvious and worst example was that prior to 1860, the majority of U.S. presidents owned human beings as slaves and, thus, were incapable of separating their private stake in maintaining slavery from the public good of the country. This conflict brought about the Civil War and cost more than 500,000 lives (not to mention the millions of lives lost and damaged by being enslaved.)Painter also noted that businessmen and politicians in the 1930s were making money in Nazi Germany and did not want the U.S. to get involved in a way that could impact their bottom lines.“Where would we be today if President Franklin Roosevelt had had a Roosevelt Tower in downtown Berlin and in downtown Frankfurt and hundreds of millions of dollars outstanding to Deutsche Bank?” Painter asked.To avoid conflicts of interest, the ethics experts said, Trump should sign his business off to an independent trustee who could then sell his assets and place the profits into a true blind trust.“New York lawyers can unwind his interest in his organization within six months,” Gillers said.Painter suggested that Trump could gift his company to his adult children, but he would have to pay a hefty gift tax. This could, at the very least, protect the president from being in breach of the Constitution, he argued, although it may violate the spirit of the Emoluments Clause.During the two-hour hearing, both witnesses and congressmen agreed that the issue should not be partisan. They touched on legislation Congress could introduce (defining emoluments was one suggestion) and whether the STOCK Act, a 2012 law that bans government officials and members of Congress from using nonpublic information to gain a private profit, applies to the president (the experts agreed that it does). But, does any of this matter to the president-elect?Eisen argued that it does. He noted that Trump took flack for filling his transition team with lobbyists and then, after public pressure, removed them (well, sort of). He tried to get his children security clearances, but then blamed it on an intern. “That same intern has been getting blamed for those security clearances since I got to Washington some 25 years ago,” Eisen said. “He’s bowed once,” Eisen said, referring to those modest concessions. “He bent again just now by saying in his most recent tweets [that he would announce a decision about what to do with his business in January]. He postponed his press conference. Maybe that’s a good thing. He wants to think about these things.” “There are these baby steps,” he added. “The problem is, what we need is a giant leap.”Cummings promised that House Democrats won’t wait for Republicans to convince Trump to take that leap."

It gave no more details but said its findings were sent to prosecutors investigating foul play.“The technical investigation committee ... places itself and its expertise at the disposal of prosecutors,” it said.A judicial source said the prosecution had not received details about the explosives traces but would include the coroner’s findings in its inquiries.An Egyptian source familiar with the matter said Egypt had informed France months ago about its findings but French investigators had requested more time to study them.“That is why it took so long to make an announcement,” the source said, declining to be named as the investigation is continuing.Paris newspaper Le Figaro reported in September that French investigators had seen trace levels of TNT on the plane’s debris but were prevented from further examining it. Egyptian officials denied at the time obstructing French inquiries.France has hinted at its frustration at the pace of the investigation but has stopped short of openly criticizing Cairo, with which it enjoys broadly positive relations and which has ordered French Rafale fighter jets.SMOKEIn a telephone call between the countries’ foreign ministers on Aug. 3, France’s Jean-Marc Ayrault spoke of the “difficult situation for families waiting to recover bodies and personal effects of the victims and to know the causes of the crash.”Two Western sources briefed on the investigation expressed reservations about the explosives findings and said a technical cause remained the most likely.One of the sources said the traces of explosives reportedly found appeared to be identical to samples previously held in stock, whereas there would usually be tiny forensic differences.Neither source agreed to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.A spokesman for France’s BEA air crash investigation agency said it was not involved in the analysis and declined further comment. The BEA is accredited to the investigation as the Airbus aircraft was designed and built in France.It provided help on the sea search and repairs to damaged flight recorders, but Western sources say it has mainly been kept at arm’s length from the rest of the investigation.Planemaker Airbus declined comment on the Egyptian announcement.Audio from the flight recorder mentions a fire on board the plane in its final moments and analysis of the flight data recorder showed smoke in the lavatory and avionics bay.The Paris prosecutor’s office opened a manslaughter investigation in June but said it was not looking into terrorism as a possible cause of the crash at this stage.No group has claimed responsibility for the crash.In October 2015, a bomb brought down a Metrojet plane carrying Russian holidaymakers home from the Red Sea resort of Sharm al-Sheikh, killing all 224 people on board.Islamic State claimed responsibility for that attack, saying it smuggled aboard explosives in a soft drink can."

And it’s upsetting for my brother.”According to a student, “an older looking person” boarded their bus and asked the driver to hand out the “present” to everyone who boarded, which LGBTQ advocate Damien Stevens shared on Facebook.A note written outside one of the envelopes read: “To the wonderful people who care for me everyday! [sic] Merry Christmas.”Kyabram College’s principal, Stuart Bott, said that the pamphlets did not reflect the public school’s position on marriage equality. “We are an inclusive school, and are working with families to say that won’t happen again,” he told Fairfax Media.Marriage Alliance said they didn’t authorize the pamphlets’ distribution and a volunteer was responsible.“This was not an action that was part of a campaign from Marriage Alliance and is not condoned or endorsed by Marriage Alliance,” a spokesperson told BuzzFeed. “This action was taken by an individual who has since been contacted regarding this matter.”Back in October, Marriage Alliance was again criticized for distributing the pamphlets into neighborhood mailboxes.“The problem with the leaflet is that it’s so misleading and untruthful,” one recipient told Australia’s Star Observer at the time. “I was thinking of friends and all the young people I’ve supported over the years – I hope they don’t see this, and that it doesn’t reinforce the ignorant views of some of their family.”"

She claims that the sheriff’s office racially profiled her and unconstitutionally detained her based on a request from Immigration and Customs Enforcement ― even though she is a U.S. citizen. The system that entangled her is the same one President-elect Donald Trump, an Arpaio ally, wants to force upon every jurisdiction: coordination between police and immigration enforcement that, allegedly in this instance, resulted in mistreatment by both.She was arrested in March after obstructing a highway as part of a protest against Trump’s presidential candidacy. Gonzalez said she was taken to a Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office jail, where she told law enforcement that she was a U.S. citizen and showed them her driver’s license, but she was then questioned by an ICE officer. She was arrested with two other protesters who were not Latino and were not questioned by ICE, according to the lawsuit.Gonzalez says in the lawsuit that after she declined to answer questions about her citizenship without talking to an attorney, the ICE officer called her a “pain-in-the-ass illegal.” The officer then issued a detainer request to hold her for immigration purposes, falsely claiming that she was in deportation proceedings and that she had made statements indicating she was undocumented, according to the lawsuit.The jail continued to hold her even after a judge ordered her released the night of her arrest. She was placed in solitary confinement overnight and then taken in the morning to an ICE facility, where she was released once they discovered she was a U.S. citizen, according to the lawsuit. “Because my last name is Gonzalez I was treated differently in Arpaio’s jail,” she said in a statement Thursday. “I was interrogated differently and ultimately I was held in custody with no legal basis all because [of] how the sheriff views people like me.”A spokesperson for ICE said the agency does not comment on pending litigation, even if it is not a defendant. The Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office did not respond to a request for comment. Arpaio, whose 24-year tenure ends next month, is infamous for his treatment of prisoners and undocumented immigrants, including forcing jail inmates to wear pink underwear and conducting sweeps that targeted Latinos. He was charged with criminal contempt earlier this year for continuing immigration patrols in violation of a court order over racial profiling. His defeat by Democrat Paul Penzone on Nov. 8 was a sliver of good news for immigrant rights advocates, who suffered a major blow with the election of Trump last month. Trump has applauded Arpaio’s immigration enforcement efforts and says he will punish so-called sanctuary cities that do not honor all of ICE’s requests to detain suspected undocumented immigrants. Currently, ICE issues detainers to local law enforcement agencies when it suspects that someone in custody is undocumented, but local law enforcement is not required to comply. Some jurisdictions have opted against full compliance, often based on concerns it could hurt community policing efforts by making undocumented immigrants fearful of law enforcement. There are also debates about whether detainers are legal. In 2014, a federal judge in Oregon ruled that a county had violated the Fourth Amendment rights of a woman by holding her based on an ICE request for longer than she would have been held otherwise.The lawsuit filed Thursday seeks a result similar to the 2014 ruling. “Sheriff Arpaio’s office claims that the Constitution applies differently to immigration arrests — this lawsuit is intended to set that straight,” Mark Fleming of the National Immigrant Justice Center, one of the organizations representing Gonzalez, said in a statement. “There is only one U.S. Constitution and the Fourth Amendment applies equally to every arrest.”"

The news media feasted on them, amplifying unflattering details about the Democratic rival to Republican nominee Donald Trump, whom the CIA believes was Russia’s preferred candidate.“Every major publication, including The Times, published multiple stories citing the DNC and Podesta emails posted by WikiLeaks, becoming a de facto instrument of Russian intelligence,” wrote Times reporters Eric Lipton, David Sanger and Scott Shane.The increased scrutiny on the disruptive role Russia played in the election has triggered more reflection on the role of the media itself. And for the trio behind the Times piece, that meant acknowledging that they were subjects ― not just chroniclers ― in the story they were pursuing. “We heard a lot from the folks we interviewed who were angry, frustrated, disappointed with the media and the role it played,” Lipton told The Huffington Post. “We thought it was important to articulate that in the story.” Such bits of introspection may be cheered by critics who argued in real time that reporters need to show more caution when reporting on hacked documents. But for Clinton allies and fellow Democrats, it probably feels too like little and late. The steady drip of Podesta’s emails dogged the Clinton campaign through the final month of the 2016 election cycle. The Times relied on them for a number of stories featuring revelations about the Clinton campaign and prominent Democrats. Other news outlets, including HuffPost, highlighted examples of Democratic infighting, Clinton campaign strategy, petty gossip and spats, and even media entanglements.The frenzy over the WikiLeaks releases, coupled with FBI Director James Comey’s unusual intervention in the race, contributed to Clinton receiving overwhelmingly negative coverage in the home stretch. To this day, her allies argue that those dual developments are largely to blame for her loss. And it wasn’t just the Clinton campaign that suffered. Russian hackers targeted the DNC and House Democrats too, once more taking advantage of a scoop-happy press corps to spread the stolen material. As Lipton and Shane wrote in a separate Tuesday story, in targeting those congressional Democrats, “a de facto alliance” was “formed between the Russian hackers and political bloggers and newspapers across the United States.” The media’s fixation on the contents of the hacked emails, even when Russia was believed to be responsible for making them public, has rankled Clinton allies. Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress and a Clinton backer whose impolitic comments were unearthed in the Podesta hack, told the paper that she “could not believe that reporters were covering” them. Inside newsrooms, however, the decision to cover wasn’t as simple as Tanden’s comment suggests. Reporters and editors may have recognized that by writing on hacked emails they were incentivizing hacking. At the same time, however, the hacks presented journalists with a trove of information that was both accurate and arguably in the public’s interest. How it ended up on the internet was, in some ways, a secondary point.“When these things are put in the public sphere, we’re likely to judge them for their news value, independent of the motive of the leakers,” Times Managing Editor Joseph Kahn told HuffPost.Only covering a leak in which the source’s motives are known to be pure, Kahn suggested, is a slippery slope. He argued that it wouldn’t be journalistically sound to report a leak in which a U.S. ally, like Britain, was believed to be involved, but not do so if a country more hostile to the United States is said to be responsible.“Making those judgments about the motivations of a leaker is not the sort of thing that we should be engaged in,” he said. “What we should be engaged in is making sound judgements about the news value of the information in the public sphere.”Though Kahn stressed that the underlying substance of the documents is what matters most when deciding whether or not to publish, he said that news organizations should be transparent in revealing as much as they can in real-time about who might be behind it. He noted the Times mentioned Russia’s suspected involvement in articles last month pegged to the Podesta emails and recently put together a “crack team of investigative reporters” to examine “how the leak happened and the foreign power believed to be behind it.”Scott Shane, a member of that team, said in an email that it’s “very tricky to abstain from even marginally newsworthy stuff because of a suspected sinister purpose on the part of the hacker or leaker.”“But I suspect it’s something we’ll face again and again,” he continued. “It’s parallel to, but different from, the issues raised when we published the diplomatic cables from WikiLeaks and the Snowden documents.”Journalists, as Shane noted, have been put in these situations before. In 2010, former Army private Chelsea Manning leaked a large cache of U.S. government documents related to the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and international diplomacy to WikiLeaks, which worked with major news outlets on covering the materials. Three years later, National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden provided journalists with documents detailing the sprawling U.S. surveillance state.The 2014 Sony hack, which the U.S. government has said was perpetrated by North Korea in response to a movie mocking dictator Kim Jong Un, was more complicated. In that case, an outside foreign power was suspected rather than a whistleblower with inside access, a more common journalistic scenario. Still, the Times, and other news organizations, covered many revelations in the Sony emails.Lipton, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his 2014 series on the corporate lobbying of state attorneys, reported late that year on efforts by the Motion Picture Association of America to convince attorneys general to build cases against Google. He relied, in part, on emails from the Sony hack.Though Lipton said the news industry is still “coming to terms with what the rules can be” when covering large-scale leaks and hacks, including those believed to be directed by foreign powers, he raised some questions that emphasize why journalists are still likely to cover the newsworthy elements regardless of the source.“How do you turn away from something of real news value that the public needs to know?” he asked. “Are you going to censor that because of how you got it?”"
52,POLITICS,Rep. Peter King Urges Donald Trump To Create A Federal Muslim Surveillance Program,Christopher Mathias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/peter-king-muslim-surveillance-trump_us_5852fdcae4b0b3ddfd8bc377,He said it should be modeled after the NYPD surveillance program -- which yielded no terror leads.,2016-12-15,"Tens of thousands of New Yorkers participated in a silent march on June 17, 2012 to protest the NYPD's religious and racial profiling.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58531956120000c40beef8f0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK ― Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) is encouraging Donald Trump to create a federal Muslim surveillance program that’s modeled after New York City’s failed and likely unconstitutional program.“The main issues I discussed were what we have to do to have the Justice Department and the FBI be more leaning-forward when it comes to investigating Islamic terrorism,” King told reporters in the lobby of Trump Tower in Manhattan after meeting with the president-elect on Thursday.“I suggested a program similar to what Commissioner Kelly did here in New York,” King said, referring to former New York City Police Department Commissioner Ray Kelly, “and that we can’t worry about political correctness.” For over half a decade after the 9/11 terror attacks, Kelly oversaw a surveillance program that targeted New York and New Jersey Muslims because of their faith. Officers in the since-disbanded Demographics Unit infiltrated Muslim student groups, kept track of Muslims who changed their last names, eavesdropped on conversations between Muslims, spied on Muslim-owned businesses, recorded imam’s sermons, and put undercover officers and informants inside mosques. King said Thursday that this program was “very aggressive and forward-leaning when it came to trying to estimate where terror would be coming from.” Kelly’s surveillance program, King added, “which unfortunately the civil liberties union and The New York Times didn’t like ... were very effective in stopping terrorism and they really should be a model for the country.”But after The Associated Press exposed the NYPD’s surveillance program in a series of Pulitzer-Prize winning reports in 2011, the department was forced to admit in court that the program had yielded exactly zero leads into criminal or terrorist activity. Additionally, a 2012 City University of New York School of Law report found that the NYPD’s program had created “a pervasive climate of fear and suspicion, encroaching upon every aspect of [Muslims’] individual and community life.”The program also “severed the trust that should exist between the police department and the communities it is charged with protecting,” the report said.In 2013, the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups sued New York City over the NYPD’s Muslim surveillance program. Earlier this year, the plaintiffs in that case proposed a settlement that is still being negotiated and would prevent the police department from conducting investigations on the basis of race, religion or ethnicity.Another lawsuit, filed by Muslim Advocates and the Center for Constitutional Rights, is currently in pretrial litigation. In October 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit reinstated the case after a previous dismissal, issuing a powerfully worded decision comparing the NYPD’s Muslim surveillance program to some of the worst civil liberties violations in America’s history. “What occurs here in one guise is not new,” the court wrote. “We have been down similar roads before. Jewish-Americans during the Red Scare, African-Americans during the Civil Rights Movement, and Japanese-Americans during World War II are examples that readily spring to mind. We are left to wonder why we cannot see with foresight what we see so clearly with hindsight—that “[l]oyalty is a matter of the heart and mind[,] not race, creed, or color.”The ACLU tweeted on Thursday that it would sue if Trump were to implement a federal Muslim surveillance program. During his presidential campaign, Trump called for the creation of a national database of Muslims, the profiling of Muslims and the surveillance of mosques. (American mosques are actually a great deterrent against radicalization.) And after the terror attack this year in Orlando, Florida, Trump lashed out at New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio for disbanding the NYPD unit that monitored Muslims. “We need justice, we need vigilance, we need great intelligence-gathering systems, which we don’t have,” Trump said at the time. “We had them in New York City, as an example, probably the best in the nation, and the new mayor just broke it all up and disbanded it, he thought it was inappropriate … that was unbelievable, that was one of the best of all systems. We need intelligence gathering like never before.”Asked Thursday how Trump had responded to his proposal for a federal Muslim surveillance program, King said, “I was talking and he was nodding.”Ben Walsh contributed reporting from Trump Tower. The Huffington Post is documenting the rising wave of anti-Muslim bigotry and violence in America. Take a stand against hate."

In the past, their rental homes have been the epitome of laid-back luxury.The U.S. Coast Guard has set up a temporary security zone in Kailua, in effect from Friday morning until Jan. 2, according to Hawaii News Now.The first family’s activities of choice while in the Aloha State typically include golfing, enjoying Oahu’s beaches, dining at favorite restaurants, such as Alan Wong’s, and eating shave ice at Island Snow in Kailua.The vacation will also be historic. Obama will meet with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe after Christmas to visit Pearl Harbor and remember victims of Japan’s attack 75 years ago. Abe will be the first incumbent Japanese prime minister to visit the site.“This will be a visit to console the souls of the victims,” Abe told reporters this month.Abe’s Pearl Harbor visit comes after Obama visited Hiroshima in May to mourn the thousands killed by a U.S. atomic bomb in 1945.

Republican lawmakers hastily introduced Senate Bill 4 and House Bill 17 in the state legislature late Wednesday night. Both bills would heavily limit the governor’s power if passed. The incoming governor would not be able to make appointments to certain departments, the State Board of Elections would be effectively rendered useless and potentially unconstitutional bills would be more difficult to challenge in the courts.But Cooper made it clear during a press conference on Thursday that if he believes any legislation pushed by the Republican-controlled state Congress is unconstitutional, he will sue the parties responsible. “They will see me in court,” he said. “And they don’t have a very good track record there.”Republicans could hinder a multitude of public efforts with these bills, depending on which cabinet appointments they decide to revoke from Cooper.“Most people might think this is a partisan power grab, but it is really more ominous,” Cooper said. “It’s really about hurting public education, working families, state employees, health care and clean air and water.”He said that taking away the governor’s ability to make decisions on education policy could lead to public education being defunded and more emphasis being placed on private school vouchers. Similarly, if Cooper can’t appoint the leader of the state Department of Commerce, the result could be tax hikes for the middle class and small businesses. And if Cooper can’t select the head of North Carolina’s Department of Health and Human Services, it could lead to the end of Medicaid expansion, which could particularly hurt more rural parts of the state.Cooper said he’s open to working with Republicans, but said they’d have to find something else to agree on other than removing money from public education or harming the public’s health. “Regardless of if any of this legislation passes, I will use all of our tools ― and we have a lot ― to lead this state in the right direction,” he said.

56,LATINO VOICES,Pedro Villanueva's Family Is Still Waiting For Answers 6 Months After Cops Killed Their Unarmed Son,"Liz Martinez and Roque Planas, Guest Writers",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pedro-villanuevas-family-is-still-waiting-for-answers-six-months-after-cops-killed-their-unarmed-son_us_5851ad58e4b0e411bfd52842,Undercover California Highway Patrol officers opened fire on the 19-year-old after chasing him in an unmarked car.,2016-12-15,Bullet holes mark the windshield of the Chevrolet Silverado truck that Pedro Villanueva was driving when California Highway Patrol officers opened fire at him on July 3.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5851b036120000c40beef55b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"LOS ANGELES ― Days before he died, Pedro Villanueva asked his mother for permission to go to Tijuana with his cousin over the Fourth of July weekend. She refused, worrying that Mexico would be too dangerous for her 19-year-old son.  Now she wonders if she made the right decision. “I said, ‘Oh no, if you go to Tijuana, what if something happens to you?’” Hortencia Villanueva told The Huffington Post. “You know, [as a parent] you’re always trying to protect your children. And always thinking that the worst things happen in Mexico, not knowing that these things can happen right here. I thought to myself, ‘Why didn’t I let him go, why didn’t I let him go?’”Two undercover California Highway Patrol officers shot and killed Pedro Villanueva on July 3, after chasing him from a so-called “sideshow” ― unauthorized events where truck drivers perform stunts like doughnuts. Neither Villanueva nor his friend riding in the passenger seat were armed. In a year marked by politically charged police killings of unarmed black men, Villanueva’s death at the hands of the California Highway Patrol sparked local protests driven by a similar sense of outrage over what many viewed as a racially motivated injustice. The case also raised questions about whether the undercover patrolmen should have opened fire when they hadn’t identified themselves as law enforcement officers.Six months later, those questions are still churning their way through law enforcement bureaucracies. The Fullerton Police Department launched an investigation into the shooting and the Orange County District Attorney’s Office has yet to determine whether to bring criminal charges against the two officers. The family, in turn, filed a legal claim against the California Highway Patrol that could serve as the prelude to civil lawsuit.In the meantime, the Villanueva family struggles to adapt to life without Pedro. Speaking with HuffPost in their most extensive interviews since Villanueva’s death, Pedro Villanueva’s parents, siblings and friends painted a portrait of an upbeat teenager whose unexplained death has torn a hole in their lives.  “I have all my children, but now one is gone,” Pedro’s father Armando said. “Everything I smiled about, all my joy ― it was taken from me in seconds.” To those who knew him, Villanueva was an upbeat young man who liked to dance, play music and pitch in after school at the family restaurant, the Villanueva Mexican Grill. He dreamed of starting a restaurant of his own and one day buying a house, his father says. The family home in the Canoga Park neighborhood in northern Los Angeles is filled with pictures of him ― Pedro strumming the guitar, Pedro laying out at the beach, Pedro with a mouth full of braces holding his little brother as a baby.“It only seems to get worse,” Pedro’s sister, Erica Villanueva, said. “You miss a person. It’s kind of hard to accept it. You don’t know what to do to make it better. It just comes back and it’s like, ‘It’s real. He’s not gonna come back,’ you know? So I don’t know how to cope with that.”On the night of July 3, Pedro Villanueva took his father’s 2015 Chevy Silverado with a friend out to a sideshow in Fullerton, outside Los Angeles. But California Highway Patrolmen were also there surveilling the event, as part of an investigation into illegal street races ― though the sideshow Villanueva attended wasn’t a race and was held off the street in a parking lot.When Villanueva and his friend, Francisco Orozco, pulled out of the parking lot where the sideshow took place, two undercover patrolmen followed in a car behind them. Both officers wore plain clothes. Their car wasn’t marked as a law enforcement vehicle. The patrolmen chased the young men anyway, alleging that Villanueva’s truck reached a speed of nearly 90 miles per hour, before getting lost, reaching a dead end and then turning around. When Villanueva then drove toward the officers, they opened fired, leaving at least six bullet holes in the truck’s windshield. Villanueva died at the scene. Orozco was hospitalized for a gunshot wound to the arm.The CHP has yet to release the names of the officers involved, citing the ongoing investigation by the Fullerton Police Department that could lead the Orange County district attorney’s office to file criminal charges against them. Both the CHP and Fullerton Police Department declined to comment for this story, citing the ongoing investigation. It’s common for large police departments, including the LAPD, to prohibit officers from opening fire at moving vehicles, according to The Los Angeles Times. But the CHP has not adopted rules prohibiting the practice.“This is an ongoing investigation, and one of the biggest questions that we’re all asking is what was the justification for using deadly force?” the family’s attorney, Paul Kiesel, said. “Because it’s undisputed that neither the driver nor the passenger had weapons … At the time, all the boys knew is that they were being followed out of the parking lot by a dark-colored vehicle. No siren, no overhead police lights. Nothing.” If the investigation results in criminal charges for the patrolmen who shot Villanueva, it will make his case unique. In the decade from 2005 to 2015, only a single police officer faced murder or manslaughter charges for a killing committed on the job, according to The Los Angeles Times. “All I want is justice,” Armando Villanueva said. “And I want other people of the same ethnicity to see that today it was my son ― tomorrow we don’t know.” Whatever the outcome of the case, Armando likens the pain of losing his son to dismemberment ― it’s as if someone had cut his arm off, he said. Pedro’s brother, also named Armando, describes feeling a hole in his chest over his heart. “If there was one thing that I could tell him right now, just one thing, it’s that I love him,” Pedro’s brother said. “I miss him and I wish that I could give him a hug and a kiss. Just a big hug and never let him go.”Watch the Villanueva family remember Pedro in the video above. "

Pat McCrory, on Oct. 18, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5852cf061800002d00e42d03.jpeg?cache=eQNSoddwTU&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Fresh off losing control of the governor’s seat, North Carolina Republicans are now trying to undermine the election results through the state legislature by pushing bills that would limit the power of Democratic Governor-elect Roy Cooper.Cooper declared victory over Gov. Pat McCrory, the Republican incumbent, on Nov. 9, but McCrory would not concede, saying the race was too close to call since Cooper was ahead by slightly more than 4,300 votes. He then called for all provisional ballots to be counted, demanded a statewide recount and accused citizens of voter fraud before finally conceding the election to Cooper on Dec. 5.But apparently, Cooper’s fight isn’t over. If passed, Senate Bill 4 and House Bill 17 would prevent the incoming governor from making certain Cabinet appointments, reduce the power of the State Board of Elections and change the way potentially unconstitutional bills are legally challenged. What’s perhaps more troubling is that the bills aren’t clear about what to do in certain common political scenarios. Take the embattled State Board of Elections. Currently, the governor appoints all five board members. But under SB 4, there would be an executive director and eight board members ― four Democrats, four Republicans ― who would have the power to issue subpoenas and compel witnesses to testify. Cooper would be able to appoint four of the members, while two would be chosen by the state House and another two would be picked by the state Senate. County election boards would also shift from three members ― two currently appointed by the sitting governor ― to four members, evenly split along party lines.SB 4 also mandates that six members of the State Board of Elections agree on a motion before taking any action. But the bill offers no guidance on what should happen if the board is evenly split or if five members agree. “If you call an emergency meeting and only five people could attend, then you can take no action even though you have a quorum,” said state Rep. Darren Jackson, a Democrat. “This creates a board that will be frozen and unable to make decisions in any disputed case. I just don’t know how it would work.”This lack of clarity could curtail voting rights ― an issue that frequently comes before the State Board of Elections. On Election Day, the board voted to expand precinct hours in Democratic-leaning Durham County after there were technical issues with voter check-in machines that caused hour-long delays. The board also investigates voter fraud claims and handles protests of election results. Jackson called the bills “petty.”“I don’t think anyone who’s being honest would say we would be doing any of this if Roy Cooper and Judge Mike Morgan had not been elected,” he said.Morgan, an African-American judge, was elected to the state Supreme Court, giving liberal justices a 4-3 advantage. SB 4 proposes that any appeals to legislation move through the Republican-dominated state Court of Appeals before going to the now Democratic-leaning state Supreme Court. Any Supreme Court and Court of Appeals candidates would also have to declare a political party affiliation during elections. “We don’t look good to our people in North Carolina ― or to the rest of the country ― when laws are passed hastily in the middle of the night,” said Cooper during a press conference on Thursday. “If I believe that any of these laws that they pass hurt working families or are unconstitutional, they will see me in court,” he added. Meanwhile, HB 17 would require any of Cooper’s Cabinet picks to be approved by the Republican-dominated state Senate. It would also prevent Cooper from appointing any members to the University of North Carolina Board of Trustees and the state Board of Education. The bill will also dramatically reduce the number of Democratic policymakers Cooper can hire from 1,500 to 300 ― a maneuver that would undo an expansion gifted to McCrory at the beginning of his term in 2013.“I was just blown away reading through the bills,” said Jackson. “The way they had phrased it in the public was it wasn’t gonna be as bad as people were thinking. I can’t imagine what they decided not to include.”UPDATE: On Thursday evening, the North Carolina House passed HB 17, which would drastically limit the governor’s power to appoint Cabinet members. The bill will now head to the Senate.Related CoverageCORRECTION: A previous version of this article said Durham County was predominantly black. It is in fact only 38 percent African-American. "

He was 65.“Craig Sager was a beloved member of the Turner family for more than three decades and he has been a true inspiration to all of us,” Levy said in a statement. “There will never be another Craig Sager. His incredible talent, tireless work ethic and commitment to his craft took him all over the world covering sports.”“While he will be remembered fondly for this colorful attire and the TNT sideline interviews he conducted with NBA coaches and players, it’s the determination, grace and will to live he displayed during his battle with cancer that will be his lasting impact. Our thoughts and prayers are with Craig’s wife, Stacy, and the entire Sager family during this difficult time. We will forever be Sager Strong.”Sager had been inducted into the Sports Broadcasting Hall of Fame just this last Tuesday in New York City. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement that teams would take a moment of silence in Sager’s honor. “I ― along with the entire NBA family ― am deeply saddened by the passing of Craig Sager. Craig was as vital to the NBA as the players and coaches,” Silver said. “A true original and an essential voice on Turner Sports’ NBA coverage for 26 seasons, Craig chronicled some of the most memorable moments in league history and was a ubiquitous presence with his splashy suits and equally colorful personality. Craig earned widespread respect for his insightful reporting and inspired so many most recently with his courage.”In over four decades as a sports reporter, Sager became a beloved member of the NBA community, leading TNT’s NBA broadcasts with poignant sideline interviews and elaborate suits that only he would dare to wear on camera. While his suits were the source of an incalculable number of jokes in NBA arenas — Kevin Garnett once hilariously told Sager to burn his clothes after a game in 2009 — they were essential to who Sager was and how he gained the affection of so many people involved with the NBA. To viewers, it’s also how he became the most visible face on NBA sidelines. Coaches and players come and go at arenas, but for fans, Sager remained a basketball constant.He’d don outrageous rainbow-colored striped jackets one day and absurd plaid pants the next — every night his suits evolved into something different, fresh and fun. The suits were a gimmick, sure — beginning with a black, white and yellow seersucker suit he bought at a Goodwill store before his first on-air tryout as a weatherman in 1974 — but it undoubtedly made him an instant standout wherever he went. Sager was shameless in his fashion choices, and even won the respect of contrarian commissioner David Stern, whose wife once defended Sager’s suits so vehemently that Stern eventually backed off on insulting Sager’s sense of style. “Sports are supposed to be fun, and so I have fun with the way I dress,” he told Bleacher Report in 2015. The same can be said about his approach to sideline reporting. Mundane questions and a dull sense of enthusiasm — sights that are all too common during in-game sideline interviews with players and coaches — were never an issue with Sager. Players and coaches felt his energy and sincerity, and in return, usually responded with more fervid, detailed answers. Sager brought a special passion to his profession, and the people he covered often redirected those vibes back into Sager’s outstretched mic. Sager’s unapologetic expression of himself and his die-hard commitment to covering sports in a fun-for-the-whole-family, well-intentioned manner earned universal love from the NBA community. He developed a special bond with San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, a surly veteran of nearly three decades of NBA coaching known for giving one-note replies and openly mocking reporter questions during interviews. Popovich can eviscerate any shaky reporter with his overly candid, unfiltered answers, but around Sager, he became personable and goofy — a complete 180 from a coach whose range of emotion tends to drift between stoic and infuriated. Sager gets his pocket picked by Popovich.In an interview with HBO’s “Real Sports,” Popovich summed up Sager’s tangible on-the-court impact perfectly:“He’s just been such a genuine person who really does love the NBA and loves the game, and it comes through and you know that,” he said. “Even though he does what he does design- and fashion-wise, you know it’s part of the shtick. But his questions are always sensible, they’re always answerable and he does it with fun. He does it with humor. I react to that very positively. So we have a good time together.” The pair’s friendship has strengthened in recent years, unfortunately due to Sager’s declining health. He was first diagnosed with leukemia in April 2014, and had to miss covering the NBA playoffs that year. A life-saving bone marrow transplant from his son Craig Jr. saw him recover and come back to covering the NBA in March 2015, but a year later, he announced that his leukemia had returned. He continued to work through the return of his latest cancer, receiving well-wishes and kind overtures from nearly every interview subject. Whenever broadcasters would cut to Sager, he always looked like he was having the most fun in the room, like he felt so lucky and grateful to have the job that he had. At any sporting event, he’d first get noticed for his suit, and then get commended for a job well done, doing work that became ingrained in the memories of fans witnessing classic sports moments.It was Sager who ran the bases with Hank Aaron after he broke Babe Ruth’s home run record in 1974. It was Sager who slept alongside Seattle Slew the night before the horse won the 1977 Triple Crown. It was Sager who bailed Morganna “The Kissing Bandit” Roberts out of jail after she ran onto the field during the 1979 MLB All-Star game. Through his own intuition and love for sports, he wiggled himself into playing a part of unforgettable moments. After less than a decade of covering sports on television in the midwest, Sager signed on to CNN in 1981 as employee No. 343 after being wooed by Ted Turner. He covered the Olympics and the World Cup before joining TNT’s NBA broadcast team in 1991 as the first sideline reporter in NBA history. He’s been making sportscasting history ever since. "

They did not rule out the possibility other attackers were involved.“We have a person who is arrested who may have connections to the event in Stockholm earlier today,” police spokesperson Towe Hagg said.There was no immediate claim of responsibility.“I turned around and saw a big truck coming toward me. It swerved from side to side. It didn’t look out of control, it was trying to hit people,” Glen Foran, an Australian tourist in his 40s, told Reuters.“It hit people, it was terrible. It hit a pram with a kid in it, demolished it,” he said.“It took a long time for police to get here. I suppose from their view it was quick, but it felt like forever.”Part of central Stockholm was cordoned off and the area was evacuated, including the main train station. All subway traffic was halted on police orders. Government offices were closed. (Map of attack location - tmsnrt.rs/2oguW2M)“Sweden has been attacked. Everything points to the fact that this is a terrorist attack,” Prime Minister Stefan Lofven told reporters during a visit to western Sweden. He was immediately returning to the capital.Many police and emergency services personnel were at the scene, said a Reuters witness who saw policemen put what appeared to be two bodies into body bags. Bloody tyre tracks on Drottninggatan (Queen Street) showed where the truck had passed.The truck had been stolen while making a beer delivery to a tapas bar further up Drottninggatan, Spendrups Brewery spokesman Marten Lyth said. A masked person jumped into the cab, started the truck and drove away.“We were standing by the traffic lights at Drottninggatan and then we heard some screaming and saw a truck coming,” a witness who declined to be named told Reuters.“Then it drove into a pillar at Ahlens City (department store) where the hood started burning. When it stopped we saw a man lying under the tyre. It was terrible to see,” said the man, who saw the incident from his car.Police said four people had died and 15 were injured. National news agency TT said those hurt included the delivery driver, who had tried to stop the hijack.Arash Pendari runs Vionlabs, a startup located in an office building just a few hundred feet from the crash. He was working Friday when he heard a loud noise outside his window and saw people “running away in a panic” on the street below.“Police came quickly and started leading people away,” Pendari, 43, told The Huffington Post on Friday. “There was blood on the ground.”“We’re definitely shocked,” Pendari added. “We’re not used to this type of commotion, especially in the central city and on a Friday on such a crowded day.”Several attacks in which trucks or cars have driven into crowds have taken place in Europe in the past year. Al Qaeda in 2010 urged its followers to use trucks as a weapon.Islamic State claimed responsibility for an attack in Nice, France, last July, when a truck killed 86 people celebrating Bastille Day, and one in Berlin in December, when a truck smashed through a Christmas market, killing 12 people.Magnus Ranstorp, head of terrorism research at the Swedish Defence University, told Reuters the attacker’s approach was similar to those in Berlin and Nice: “Hijacking a truck, that has happened before.”“And this is a pretty cunning modus operandi,” he said. “To drive to Ahlens (department store) and stop ... There is a way down to the subway just a few meters away from there, and then you ... can jump on any train you want and quickly disappear.”Sweden’s King Carl Gustaf said in a statement: “Our thoughts are going out to those that were affected, and to their families.”“An attack on any of our member states is an attack on us all,” said European Union chief executive Jean-Claude Juncker.Stockholmers opened up their homes and offered lifts to people who were unable to get home or needed a place to stay.The attack was the latest to hit the Nordic region after shootings in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 2015 that killed three people and the 2011 bombing and shooting by far right extremist Anders Behring Breivik that killed 77 people in Norway.Sweden has not been hit by a large-scale attack, although in December 2010, a man blew himself up only a few hundred yards from the site of the latest incident in a failed suicide attack.In February U.S. President Donald Trump falsely suggested there had been an immigration-related security incident in Sweden, to the bafflement of Swedes.Swedish authorities raised the national security threat level to four on a scale of five in October 2010 but lowered the level to three, indicating a “raised threat”, in March 2016.Police in Norway’s largest cities and at Oslo’s airport will carry weapons until further notice following the attack. Denmark has been on high alert since the February 2015 shootings.Neutral Sweden has not fought a war in more than 200 years, but its military has taken part in U.N peacekeeping missions in a number of conflict zones in recent years, including Iraq, Mali and Afghanistan.The Sapo security police said in its annual report it was impossible to say how big a risk there was that Sweden would be targeted like other European cities, but that, if so “it is most likely that it would be undertaken by a lone attacker”.(Reporting by Stockholm newsroom; Writing by Gwladys Fouche; Editing by Catherine Evans)"

It takes real money.”The measure will increase the excise tax on gasoline by 12 cents per gallon from the current $0.28 and on diesel fuel by 20 cents per gallon, among other fees, over 10 years. The money will be used for repairs to roads and bridges as well as for anti-congestion projects.Owners of electric vehicles, who do not use gasoline and would not pay the gas tax, would have to pay a $100 fee to help repair roads. The fees and taxes should raise about $5.2 billion per year.The average motorist in California will see costs increase by about $10 a month, according to Democrats, the Sacramento Bee newspaper reported.Republicans condemned the plan, saying the state’s transportation taxes and fees were already among the highest in the country.“Democrats want us to pick up the tab for their decades of neglect,” state party chairman Jim Brulte said in a statement. “The liberal Democrat elites are out of touch and Californians should not be used as a piggy bank for the majority party’s failures.”California’s transportation systems have gone unrepaired and unexpanded for decades, as budget constraints and politics have stymied plans by Democrats and Republicans alike.Brown, a fiscal moderate credited with bringing the state back from a $27 billion budget gap, has refused to sign on to plans that involve borrowing money, and Republicans and some moderate Democrats have resisted raising gasoline taxes.But the same Democratic wave that led California to go two-for-one in favor of former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton last November gave the party a two-thirds majority in both houses of the legislature, enough to pass new taxes without Republican support.The deal won support of construction companies and labor unions, and Democratic lawmakers on Wednesday put up a unified front on what had been the divisive issue of raising taxes."

She’s the baby of the popular mountain lion P-23. The kitten’s dad could be P-23’s half brother, P-30, ABC-7 reported Wednesday. The two adults were seen hanging around together for three days three months before the kitten was born. The mating underscores one of the problems of the mountain lion population in the area. It’s difficult for the animals to travel longer distances because highways hem them in, so they tend to inbreed. So far, veterinarians haven’t spotted any physical problems in the population due to inbreeding.A team of experts traveled to P-54’s den while mom was away and sedated the young kitten, took blood and tissue samples, tagged her ear, and planted a tracking device in her abdomen, ranger Kate Kuykendall, of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, told the Los Angeles Daily News. Veterinarians sent a sample of the kitten’s blood to the University of California, Los Angeles, for genetic testing to determine if her father is P-30. If so, P-54 would be the young male’s first known offspring.The new kitten mark’s P-23’s third time being a mom. Only one other previous cub (P-53) survived, however, and was fitted with an adult tracking collar last summer. Littermates were eaten by other animals.This is a video of P-53, earlier surviving kitten of P-23, “chirping”:Last fall, a mother and two of her three cubs were killed over the space of a few weeks as they tried to cross a freeway.Plans are underway now to construct a wildlife corridor bridge that would allow the animals in the Santa Monica Mountains to head north into far larger public lands. The bridge would cross the eight-lane Highway 101 in the Los Angeles suburbs to connect the Santa Monica Mountains and the Simi Hills."

As part of that change, the FCC reclassified internet service providers much like utilities.Pai wants to overturn that reclassification, but wants internet providers to voluntarily agree to not obstruct or slow consumer access to web content, two officials said late Tuesday.The officials briefed on the meeting said Pai suggested companies commit in writing to open internet principles and including them in their terms of service, which would make them binding.It is unclear if regulators could legally compel internet providers to adopt open internet principles without existing net neutrality rules.As part of that move, the Federal Trade Commission would assume oversight of ensuring compliance.Three sources said Pai plans to unveil his proposal to overturn the rules as early as late April and it could face an initial vote in May or June.Internet providers like AT&T Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and Comcast Corp have argued net neutrality rules would make it harder to manage internet traffic and investment in additional capacity less likely. Websites worry that without the rules they might lose access to customers.AT&T and major trade groups sued the FCC in 2015 over the net neutrality rules.Democrats and privacy advocates say net neutrality is crucial to keeping the internet open.Pai in December predicted that net neutrality’s days were numbered. He told Reuters in February he believes “in a free and open internet and the only question is what regulatory framework best secures that.”Pai and congressional Republicans have moved quickly to dismantle Obama-era telecommunications rules.Trump on Monday signed a repeal of Obama-era broadband privacy rules a victory for internet service providers and a blow to privacy advocates.Politico Pro reported some details of the meeting with trade groups on Thursday.(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)"

But the school she chose is a less-than-shining example of the charter school movement. SLAM Academy has a mediocre academic rating and receives operational support from a company with a sketchy past. The school, formally called Sports Leadership And Management Academy, covers grades 6 through 12 with a focus on the business of sports. It was founded by the rapper Pitbull, who appeared alongside DeVos on Thursday.Pitbull currently acts as SLAM’s “brand ambassador,” said Lynn Norman-Teck, executive director of the Florida Charter School Alliance, who was acting as a spokesperson for the school.SLAM, which opened in 2013, primarily serves low-income students of color. It aims to take advantage of kids’ interest in athletics to show them there are other sports industry careers besides playing on a team. “Staying in school and going to college is a great way to stay involved in sports management,” said Norman-Teck. SLAM has a lackluster academic track record, consistently receiving a “C” rating from the state.The school has also partnered with a for-profit education services provider called Academica for operational support. Academica is one of the Sunshine State’s biggest for-profit charter management companies, working with more than 100 schools in Florida, according to the Miami Herald.It has also been the subject of scrutiny over its close ties to lawmakers and possible conflicts of interest. In 2011, Academica was the subject of a Herald investigation titled “Cashing In On Kids,” which looked into its questionable, yet profitable, business dealings. At the time, the CEO was found to be renting space in his real estate holdings for unusually high prices to some of the schools the company operationally supports. DeVos praised Miami’s school district for offering students the option to attend such a school. “I know that many of you are blazing the trails in your family and showing what can be done if you’re just given the opportunity,” DeVos said at the school event, according to the Herald. “I want to encourage you, encourage you in your studies, encourage you to continue to pursue the passion that is inside of you, whatever that may be.”The meeting was set up by the Education Department, which contacted SLAM for a tour, said Norman-Teck. She acknowledged the school has had “its ups and downs.”“It’s moving along. Kids are making progress. Is it a top-performing school? No. But I think there are aspirations to get it there,” she said.As for the Academica connection, Norman-Teck noted that the company “purely handles operations” and suggested that the problems highlighted in the Herald investigation have been “cleared up.” Academica did not respond to The Huffington Post’s requests for comment.DeVos is a charter school evangelist who believes all kids should have access to public charter schools and private schools. Her critics worry that her support for school choice could undermine traditional public schools, which the majority of American students attend. As part of her trip to Miami, she also visited Florida International University and a religious elementary school, which participates in the state’s tax credit scholarship program. That program gives individuals and corporations tax breaks if they donate to an organization that grants school scholarships to low-income children. DeVos is a fan. The Trump administration is even considering instituting such an initiative on the national level, Politico reported. "
64,POLITICS,Senate Confirms Neil Gorsuch To Supreme Court After Historic Blockade Of Obama's Nominee,Jennifer Bendery and Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senate-confirms-neil-gorsuch_us_58e7a139e4b05413bfe244ca,Republicans blew up the rules to force Donald Trump's nominee through.,2017-04-07,"Mitch McConnell gives a thumbs-up after changing the Senate rules to force through President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e7a61516000021004d9527.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The Senate confirmed Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court on Friday, ending an ugly, weeks-long fight between Democrats who demanded a different nominee and Republicans who changed the rules to go around them entirely.Gorsuch was confirmed, 54 to 45. Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) and Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.) were the only Democrats who voted with Republicans to support President Donald Trump’s court pick. Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) missed the vote.Following the vote, the Supreme Court announced that Gorsuch would be sworn in by Chief Justice John Roberts as the nation’s 101st associate justice in a private ceremony on Monday. Justice Anthony Kennedy, for whom Gorsuch clerked as a young lawyer, will administer a public oath later at the White House.Republican leaders were thrilled to chalk up the win, arguably their party’s first major victory since Trump became president.“He’s going to make an incredible addition to the court,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) raved ahead of the vote.In a statement, Trump called Gorsuch’s confirmation process “one of the most transparent and accessible in history.”“As a deep believer in the rule of law, Judge Gorsuch will serve the American people with distinction as he continues to faithfully and vigorously defend our Constitution,” he said. At 49, Gorsuch’s lifetime appointment to the bench is expected to last decades.Democrats had argued that Gorsuch, a conservative Colorado federal appeals judge, was out of the mainstream and too aligned with corporate interests to be a fair justice. They urged Republicans to put forward a consensus nominee. When that didn’t happen, they made history on Thursday by staging a party-line filibuster of the Supreme Court nominee.Republicans retaliated by making history, too: They unilaterally blew up the rules so it only takes 51 votes, instead of 60, to advance any Supreme Court nominee. There are 52 Republicans, so after that rules change, they had the votes to bypass Democrats and move Gorsuch along.The rules change means that majority parties will no longer have to concern themselves, at all, with the opinions or votes of minority party members for any presidential appointments.Senators in both parties are walking away from this fight with a bitter taste in their mouths.“I could not help but notice a number of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle high-fiving each other,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said on Thursday after the rules change. “That image stays with me as I stand here now. It saddens me. There is no cause for celebration in what happened in the Senate just hours ago. No one should sleep well tonight. No one should underestimate the magnitude of what happened here.”“I wish that an important aspect to this process had played out differently. It didn’t have to be this way,” McConnell said on Friday. “But today is a new day. I hope my Democratic friends will take this moment to reflect on perhaps considering a turning point in their outlook going forward.”Gorsuch will fill the seat on the court previously held by conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February 2016. President Barack Obama put forward a nominee, Merrick Garland, to fill that seat in March 2016. But McConnell took the unprecedented step of refusing to give him a hearing ― never mind a vote ― for the entire year, arguing that the next president should get to fill the court vacancy. He took that position literally an hour after news of Scalia’s death broke.Democrats’ anger over Garland’s mistreatment spilled over into the fight over Gorsuch. They watched as Republicans made the case for why Gorsuch deserved a vote by using the exact same arguments Democrats made all last year for why Garland deserved a vote.“Judge Neil Gorsuch has spent more than a decade on the federal bench. He graduated from Harvard Law School, clerked for the Supreme Court, served in the Department of Justice and has received a unanimous ‘well qualified’ rating from the American Bar Association,” Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) said during a Judiciary Committee hearing last month. “If all of those things were sufficient reason to confirm a nominee to the Supreme Court, Chief Judge Merrick Garland would be sitting on the court today.”The partisan mudslinging is certain to affect the public’s perception of the Supreme Court, which will now return to its full lineup of justices and perhaps begin taking up some of the controversial cases it’s avoided while Scalia’s seat was unfilled.Some of the politically charged cases expected to reach the court soon involve North Carolina’s controversial voter ID law, a new challenge to the livelihood of public-sector unions and an appeal of Trump’s beleaguered travel ban targeting several Muslim-majority countries.Gorsuch has given very little indication not just of how he might rule on cases like these, but also of how he views important issues of constitutional law, such as the future of abortion rights, religious accommodations and the role of money in politics. He has asserted that he would rule independently from the man who picked him for the job — despite the president’s promises to his voters that he’d choose a judge who would overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade.“If it looks like I’m giving hints or previews or intimations about how I might rule, I think that’s the beginning of the end of the independent judiciary, if judges have to make effectively campaign promises for confirmation,” Gorsuch told the Senate Judiciary Committee last month.This story has been updated with a statement from Trump."

Johnson also plays the lead role of Eddie Garrett, a small-time, Chicago-based gambler who agrees to hold on to a duffel bag (and not open it) for an acquaintance heading to prison. When his temptation gets the best of him, he opens the bag and discovers that it’s full of cash. Needless to say, Eddie gets himself into a bit of a mess after that. “This is a movie I really love,” Johnson told The Huffington Post. “I love story. I love tension and I love having a character that you care about. And the game of it was, ‘Can we make an indie movie but have a story to it?’ … That was the hope. We want to put him [Eddie] through a hero’s journey.” Eddie is the kind of guy you find yourself rooting for throughout the film as he tries to navigate love, family and holding down a job. Johnson, who grew up in the Chicago area, says he based the character partially on his own family. “I grew up nine brothers and sisters ... My father wasn’t a character in my life until I entered my 20s,” Johnson said. “So, my uncles were these larger-than-life characters to me that I really looked up to. I just thought they were the coolest guys, even if they were doing stuff that wasn’t the most above-board. The guys we saw were always loving and caring and sweet and three-dimensional. So I wanted to create a character who you feel like you’ve seen — the down-and-out gambler guy who was more real, someone you can actually relate to ... These characters for me — my family growing up — my aunts and uncles were really cool. So that was the inspiration for me.” The film co-stars Joe Lo Truglio and Aislinn Derbez, along with Keegan-Michael Key, with whom Johnson had worked previously. Key plays Gabe, Eddie’s mentor and sponsor.“I met Keegan when we did ‘Let’s Be Cops Together’ and he is one of the most talented actors I’ve ever been around,” Johnson said. “His character work, his accent work and his technical acting is so impressive that it’s scary. This is a guy I want to work with 100 times over. So with this movie, we knew the character would be a tough character but would give you laughs at any moment.” Although “Win It All” is considered a drama, Johnson and Swanberg also incorporated comedic moments into the script. “In order for the movie to work you need to believe in the story and believe in the stakes … I don’t want to spend an hour and a half in someone’s home and not make them laugh,” Johnson said.“Win It All,” directed by Swanberg,” is currently available on Netflix.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e7eb9e2c00006268ff2e96.png?cache=m5UzCypiPN&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In the world of “iZombie,” the undead may be, well, dead, but that doesn’t mean they’re not entitled to the same rights as humans like you and me. For actress Rose McIver, playing Liv, a medical examiner who eats the brains of the already deceased to solve their murders, has taken on a more political turn in the third season of the CW series, which premiered earlier this month. The new season raises questions about the state of zombie politics by positioning the walking dead as a quasi-minority group in need of protection. Given the current climate of race relations and immigration, “iZombie” very purposefully uses zombies as an allegory to speak to larger divisions and comment on the experience of the disenfranchised. When asked about the prospect of a real-life zombie outbreak, McIver said that America probably wouldn’t take too kindly to those who appear to be different from their own, zombies or otherwise. “It’s a scary thought because obviously, with our show, we don’t paint zombies as bad guys,” McIver told The Huffington Post during a recent Build Series interview. “We paint them as afflicted peoples and people that have to respond to what they’ve been given.”“You would like to think that people would tolerate, understand and protect [them]. I don’t think we aren there yet at all,” she continued. “I think it’s important to be making material that addresses different lives and completely different worldviews and how they can live together. So I’m not sure if the States is ready for a zombie outbreak, to be honest, but maybe after watching ‘iZombie’ they will be.”In the third season premiere, Seattle’s zombie population is under a constant threat of violence, as humans become increasingly aware of the their existence. Of course, historically in zombie lore, this has not gone well. Enter the shadowy and zombie-run paramilitary organization Fillmore-Graves -(get it? Fill. More.

For actress Rose McIver, playing Liv, a medical examiner who eats the brains of the already deceased to solve their murders, has taken on a more political turn in the third season of the CW series, which premiered earlier this month. The new season raises questions about the state of zombie politics by positioning the walking dead as a quasi-minority group in need of protection. Given the current climate of race relations and immigration, “iZombie” very purposefully uses zombies as an allegory to speak to larger divisions and comment on the experience of the disenfranchised. When asked about the prospect of a real-life zombie outbreak, McIver said that America probably wouldn’t take too kindly to those who appear to be different from their own, zombies or otherwise. “It’s a scary thought because obviously, with our show, we don’t paint zombies as bad guys,” McIver told The Huffington Post during a recent Build Series interview. “We paint them as afflicted peoples and people that have to respond to what they’ve been given.”“You would like to think that people would tolerate, understand and protect [them]. I don’t think we aren there yet at all,” she continued. “I think it’s important to be making material that addresses different lives and completely different worldviews and how they can live together. So I’m not sure if the States is ready for a zombie outbreak, to be honest, but maybe after watching ‘iZombie’ they will be.”In the third season premiere, Seattle’s zombie population is under a constant threat of violence, as humans become increasingly aware of the their existence. Of course, historically in zombie lore, this has not gone well. Enter the shadowy and zombie-run paramilitary organization Fillmore-Graves -(get it? Fill. More. Graves), which has dreams of making the city a zombie safe haven by any means necessary. Now, Liv not only has to worry about how eating the brain of real housewife or a vigilante superhero might affect her personal life, but she also is contending with the growing fear and hostility toward her community. “It’s something that I hadn’t really thought of with Liv.

And as a testimony to her incredible bravery, she’s refused to stay silent about her tragedy.Sanders is a survivor of the Charleston church shooting carried out by white supremacist Dylann Roof in June 2015. Her 26-year-old son, Tywanza Sanders, and her 87-year-old aunt, Susie Jackson, died in the attack, along with seven other people who had come together inside South Carolina’s Mother Emanuel A.M.E. Church for a Bible study.Felicia told her story of survival at Tina Brown’s Women in the World summit on Wednesday. She explained how she had initially mistaken Roof for “just a child coming in to study the Bible.”As the shots rang out, she hid under a table with her granddaughter. She heard her son engaging with Roof, asking the shooter why he was carrying out the attack. Felicia said she heard the man say “he had to, because [black Americans] are raping white women and taking over the world,” a claim that Roof later repeated in a jailhouse white supremacist manifesto.Felicia then turned to the audience with a heartbreaking statement.“I look around this audience and I see so many caucasians in here. And we really don’t mean you harm. We really do not mean you harm,” she said. “The problem is that we don’t take time to know each other.”The shooter was sentenced to death in January on 18 counts, and life in prison for an additional 15. Felicia testified at that sentencing hearing, telling Roof that she still uses the bloodstained Bible she carried the day of the shooting.At the summit, Felicia said that when she first saw Roof, she thought he was “just a child coming in to study the Bible.” After the attack, she heard that he had been a loner.“If he took ten more minutes, maybe twenty more minutes to get to know each one of the people that he killed, he would have had some really great friends.”After that tragic day, Felicia said that she went through the “Our Father,” one of Christianity’s most sacred prayers, and read through it line by line. One of the phrases in that famous prayer is “forgive us our sins, as we have forgiven those who sin against us.”“Forgiveness is through and through the Bible,” Felicia said. “I was not going to give Dylann Roof the opportunity to send me to hell right with him.” She made a plea for racial reconciliation and for people to “get to know one another.”“The only thing that separates us is not knowing one another. We may have different skin colors, but we all bleed red. Imagine yourself getting to heaven. There’s no segregated area. What are you going to do?”“God is love. We made this mess, we divided one another. This is not the plan God has for us.” "
69,POLITICS,Goldman Sachs Is About To Swallow Donald Trump,"Zach Carter, Ben Walsh, and Christina Wilkie",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-white-house-gary-cohn_us_58e80609e4b00de141039aa3,Elevating Gary Cohn to chief of staff would be a major win for the Wall Street wing of the White House.,2017-04-07,"Gary Cohn arrives at Trump Tower for meetings with Donald Trump on Jan. 2, 2017 in New York City.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e808642c00006568ff2f03.jpeg?cache=NKFzMk9Mdr&ops=crop_121_148_3248_1764%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"In an attempt to rebut reports that he is governing ineffectively and beholden to a small group of fringe right-wing aides, President Donald Trump is reportedly considering yet another White House staff shakeup just 11 weeks into his presidency.Axios and The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that Trump is thinking of dismissing or demoting his current chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and his key adviser, Steve Bannon. Both outlets reported that former Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn ― who currently serves as Trump’s top economic adviser ― is a key contender to replace Priebus. “Gary Cohn would be the top pick for chief of staff,” if Priebus is fired, a White House official told The Huffington Post.In an internal struggle for Trump’s good graces, Cohn has a strong hand: He’s rich, close to the Trump family and has ex-employees who now work for the Trump family in the White House. Perhaps most importantly, his promotion could salve Trump’s ego, which has been bruised by his relatively small inauguration crowd and a series of political failures that began with his attempt to ban Muslims from traveling to the United States and continued through his catastrophic attempt to repeal Obamacare. Cohn “speaks the language of ‘business,’ which is what Trump understands,” the White House official noted. The language of business is money: Cohn walked away with $285 million when he left Goldman Sachs for the Trump administration, and is in many ways a stand-in for the kind of New York businessmen who have shunned Trump for years. After years of being spurned by the American banking elite ― Trump famously had to turn to Deutsche Bank for cash after burning his creditors in bankruptcy ― he appears to enjoy being part of the club. The White House denied the reports of a staff shakeup, writing in a statement that “the only thing we are shaking up is the way Washington operates as we push the President’s aggressive agenda forward.” Cohn is personally close to Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and adviser, and Trump’s daughter and aide Ivanka, the White House official notes. Cohn’s status in the White House is also bolstered by Goldman Sachs veteran Dina Powell, who was effectively hired as an aide to and proxy for Ivanka and now serves on the National Security Council. “Dina Powell is going to be a big, big person in the White House” the official said. “She can boost Cohn, and Cohn can do the same for her.” After spending a decade as the president and COO of Goldman Sachs, Cohn also has the boardroom skills to use those connections to his advantage. Bannon’s most recent managerial efforts focused on leading the relatively small newsroom at Breitbart, a website popular with white nationalists. Everyone who works on Wall Street does it for the same reason: the money. But high finance attracts a host of different personality types (like Cohn, Bannon is a Goldman alum). For the last half of the 20th century, big banks were a socially acceptable career choice for people with strong appetites for personal financial gain who were also interested in deploying their fortunes to support liberal causes. Banking summoned Democrats from the ether the way the oil and gas industry drew Republicans. There are still some Democrats on Wall Street today, but many of them changed teams after the financial crisis, including Cohn.During the presidencies of Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, Cohn was a heavyweight Democrat, offering up over $136,000 to official party organs while supporting individual candidates, including stalwart liberal Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.). His only donation to a Republican prior to the financial crisis, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics, was a $2,000 check to Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) in 2004. But in December of 2009, Cohn’s donations took a dramatic turn. He started giving to right-wing darlings like Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), former Rep. Eric Cantor (R-Va.) and Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), while pouring tens of thousands of dollars a cycle into the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the National Republican Congressional Committee and the Every Republican is Crucial PAC. Though Cohn is often described as a political moderate, and his opponents in the Trump White House even deride him as a “Democrat,” his partisan transformation occurred as Republicans were making a dramatic shift to the right. Cohn’s pattern of contributions doesn’t fit that of an opportunist looking to buy access to winning candidates. Prior to December 2009, he gave to Democrats whether the party’s political fortunes appeared good or bad. But that month, the House of Representatives passed its version of what would become known as the Dodd-Frank Act, and did so without the support of a single House Republican.Since then, Cohn has not flexed any particularly impressive liberal ideological muscles. During his tenure in the Trump administration, his work has included efforts on a health care bill that would have rescinded coverage from 24 million Americans ― not exactly the Wellstone-ian ideal.Cohn didn’t suffer any meaningful personal financial consequences from Dodd-Frank ($285 million, the amount he left Goldman Sachs with, is more than 5,100 times the median household income). But many on Wall Street felt attacked by the regulatory restructuring, which shifted some political and economic power away from the private sector and into the hands of federal authorities.“One of the major things people want from politicians is psychic income,” former House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank (D-Mass.) told HuffPost in 2014. “They want to be told that they are wonderful people, that their jobs are important for the human race, that they contribute greatly. Lloyd Blankfein was not really kidding when he said that, ‘We are doing God’s work.’ That’s his inner feeling. I don’t think that the [Dodd-Frank] legislation really hurt them much …. But we really hurt their feelings mightily.” Wall Street had, of course, caused millions of foreclosures and created vast human suffering by throwing the global economy into the most severe economic calamity since the Great Depression. Many families have yet to recover, but Cohn and other top bankers survived with padded pockets thanks to federal support. Cohn’s appointment as White House Chief of staff wouldn’t just be a boon for bank lobbyists seeking lucrative new loopholes. It would be a restoration of finance to the center of American politics."

Gabrielle McGrath, who is in charge of the Ice Patrol, told Popular Science the phenomenon is unprecedented.“I have about a decade of experience with the Ice Patrol, and in my time here, and talking with people who have been here longer, I’ve never seen anything like this or heard of anything like this before,” she said.Experts say strong winds are mostly to blame for the icebergs, blowing them further into the shipping lanes faster than they have before. Climate change may also play a factor, however, as warmer temperatures lead to weaker ice, which more readily breaks off and blows away.Last week, a study published in the journal Nature Communications found that tens of thousands of square miles of glaciers and ice caps along the coast of Greenland ― the primary source of ice forming the icebergs we’re currently seeing ― have reached a “tipping point” and are in rapid decline.“Most of the icebergs that enter the North Atlantic shipping lanes come from the tidewater glaciers of the west coast of Greenland,” notes the Ice Patrol. “Once an iceberg is calved from one of these glaciers it completes a 1-3 year journey to arrive in the area that the International Ice Patrol (IIP) monitors.”"

Medically speaking, leprosy is a chronic, progressive bacterial infection caused by the bacillus Mycobacterium leprae. M. leprae is a microorganism belonging to the same genus as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the pathogen that causes TB, and was discovered by Gerhard Henrik Armauer Hansen, a Norwegian doctor, in 1873. Hansen’s disease, as leprosy is also known, gets its name from Dr. Hansen. The disease is of extremely low infectivity, with over 95% of people immune to it. Even if exposed to the bacteria, it is rare for someone to develop leprosy. It has a long incubation period; it takes an average of three years, in some cases 20 to 30 years, for the disease to manifest itself. One of the early signs of leprosy are patches on the skin that have no feeling. If treated at this stage, leprosy is not disabling. Left untreated, however, the disease continues to damage nerves and destroys the body’s ability to feel pain, resulting in injury and festering wounds that cause secondary infections.

Medically speaking, leprosy is a chronic, progressive bacterial infection caused by the bacillus Mycobacterium leprae. M. leprae is a microorganism belonging to the same genus as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the pathogen that causes TB, and was discovered by Gerhard Henrik Armauer Hansen, a Norwegian doctor, in 1873. Hansen’s disease, as leprosy is also known, gets its name from Dr. Hansen. The disease is of extremely low infectivity, with over 95% of people immune to it. Even if exposed to the bacteria, it is rare for someone to develop leprosy. It has a long incubation period; it takes an average of three years, in some cases 20 to 30 years, for the disease to manifest itself. One of the early signs of leprosy are patches on the skin that have no feeling. If treated at this stage, leprosy is not disabling. Left untreated, however, the disease continues to damage nerves and destroys the body’s ability to feel pain, resulting in injury and festering wounds that cause secondary infections. This in turn can lead to the deformities characteristically associated with leprosy and result in permanent disability, including blindness. For a long time, leprosy was treated with chaulmoogra oil. The oil is made from the seeds of the fruit of the chaulmoogra tree and was widely used in Southeast Asia and India as a folk remedy.

And the president’s denial about what is happening, just feet from his luxury Florida property, doesn’t make the threat any less real.Trump has chosen Mar-a-Lago as the place to “break the ice” with Chinese President Xi Jinping, as a senior White House official put it during a background briefing Tuesday. Starting Thursday afternoon, Trump will host Xi for a highly anticipated two-day summit. It will be the first face-to-face meeting for the leaders of the world’s two largest economies and biggest emitters of greenhouse gases.The two have a lot to discuss, including trade tensions and the North Korean nuclear threat, a White House official said. But if Tuesday’s briefing was any indication, climate change — a critical issue on which the U.S. and China recently parted ways — won’t be on the agenda. Bob Deans of the environmental group Natural Resources Defense Council told The Huffington Post that the summit presents an opportunity for the two countries to strengthen their relationship and “make real progress on the central environmental challenge of our time.” And to walk away from that would be a big mistake. “We’re all counting on these two leaders to take this issue seriously and to take it up at Mar-a-Lago,” he said.In many ways, the location is perfect. South Florida, including Palm Beach County, is already taking steps to prepare for the effects of climate change, namely sea level rise. A 6-foot rise, on the high end of possible scenarios that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted by 2100, would put a significant portion of Trump’s oceanfront resort below the surface. “Even though he’s president, Mar-a-Lago is not invulnerable to sea level rise,” Palm Beach County Commissioner Steven Abrams, a Republican, recently told Florida’s Sun Sentinel newspaper.Under former President Barack Obama, the U.S. and China forged a strong partnership in the fight to combat global climate change. Obama and Xi met at the G20 Summit in Hangzhou, China, last September, where they fortified commitments to reduce carbon emissions by formally joining the Paris Agreement and pledged a “continued bilateral climate cooperation.” That move, along with India’s ratification of the agreement later that month, proved key to the pact taking effect in November. Today, the story is strikingly different. Obama ― who believed that “no challenge poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change” ― has been replaced by a president who has dismissed the phenomenon as “bullshit” and a “hoax” that was “created by and for the Chinese.”And where China and the U.S. only months ago found common ground, Trump has chosen to take the country in an opposite, dangerous direction. Since taking office, he has worked feverishly to roll back Obama-era climate policies, and has promised to save America’s dying coal industry, increase oil and gas production and make sweeping cuts at the Environmental Protection Agency that target climate programs. Meanwhile, China is forging ahead with efforts to move away from coal and reduce emissions, announcing in January that it will invest $360 billion on renewable energy, including solar and wind power, through 2020.China hasn’t shied away from calling out Trump, both for his Chinese hoax remark and his campaign promise to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate pact. At the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, in January, Xi stressed that tackling climate change is a responsibility owed to future generations and urged then president-elect Trump to keep the U.S. in the pact, calling it a “hard-won achievement” that “all signatories should stick to.”“It is important to protect the environment while pursuing economic and social progress ― to achieve harmony between man and nature, and harmony between man and society,” Xi said at the time.Climate change was mentioned only once at Tuesday’s White House briefing about the Trump-Xi summit ― by a journalist, who asked on what the U.S. and China hope to collaborate now that Trump has reversed course on climate. A White House official said that North Korea is something the U.S. and China could work together on and that there are still “a lot of areas of cooperation,” including public health.Though there are many unanswered questions about the U.S.-China relationship going forward, one thing that’s become increasingly clear is that China looks poised to lead where Trump is choosing not to.“Since Donald Trump’s election victory, China has emerged as a potential new leader on the global stage — and today’s address does little to soften the impression that President Xi is taking an increasingly assertive stance on matters of global trade and climate change,” the World Economic Forum noted in a press release about Xi’s January address.Given Trump’s actions since taking office, it is unlikely he or his team members will strike up a conversation about the threats of climate change. Which means that if the two are to have such a discussion, Xi will have to bring it up. The two will need to look no further than out one of the club’s many windows for the proof. NASA research shows that global sea levels rose an average of 3 inches between 1992 and 2015. And a University of Miami study last year found that the rate of sea level rise in South Florida had tripled, to about 3/4 inch a year, over the previous decade.In 2015, in an effort to better prepare for and minimize the effects, Palm Beach County, where Mar-a-Lago is located, hired a “climate change and sustainability coordinator,” urban land use planner Natalie Schneider.Harold Wanless, chair of the University of Miami’s geological sciences department, understands the situation facing Florida’s coastal areas well. He has co-signed at least four letters to Trump, Mar-a-Lago or a member of the president’s administration, each stressing the urgent need to accept and combat the realities of climate change. None of the letter signees received a response, he told HuffPost.Wanless can’t understand how Trump could disregard the evidence. “This is so real,” he told HuffPost. “And it’s so imminent to begin having serious effects on the stability of our coastal environments and its communities and its people. And it doesn’t matter if somebody believes in it or not, it’s happening. And it’s going to be happening at an accelerated rate.” In a post Wednesday, Melanie Hart, director of China policy at the liberal Center for American Progress, listed climate change among the five issues Trump must handle correctly during the summit. She wrote that she expects Beijing will bring up the issue, if for no other reason than to “needle” the Republican president.“On this issue, the Trump administration is setting the United States up to be the global bad guy, and that will give China leverage to push back against U.S. initiatives on other issues,” Hart wrote. “If the Trump administration denies climate science or refuses to acknowledge the positive role Beijing is playing, that will undermine Washington’s credibility when it claims to be seriously considering new measures on North Korea or trade.”"

The Russian Ministry of Justice last week added the photo to its index of extremist materials ― a list that now includes more than 4,000 images that are illegal to share. The offending image is number 4,071, which the ministry describes a “man resembling the president” whose makeup “hints at the Russian president’s allegedly nonstandard sexual orientation.”The Putin in makeup picture’s addition to the list of extremist materials stemmed from a court case in May in the city of Tver. The ruling outlawed a number of images posted on Russian social media platform Vkontakte by defendant A. V. Tsvetkov. Among other now-banned images that Tsvetkov posted were Putin as a Nazi, and overtly racist and anti-Semitic materials.Tsvetkov’s Vkontakte account is no longer accessible. The government’s description of the extremist image of Putin mentions painted eyelashes and lips, as well as a caption that uses a homophobic slur. The depiction of Putin in brightly colored cosmetics began to crop up following the Kremlin’s 2013 gay propaganda law, which effectively banned the distribution of materials giving information on LGBTQ rights. Human rights groups and activists widely condemned the discrimination, and protests around the world featured images of Putin in makeup.Russia has restrictive laws on the depiction of public figures. The Kremlin is sensitive to criticism and protests, and has banned certain opposition news sites and blogs. Last month, authorities cracked down on nationwide anti-corruption protests and arrested hundreds of demonstrators.Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov on Wednesday addressed reports of the Putin picture being added to the banned list, saying that such images don’t have an effect on the president. “As a person, he might be stung, but as president he is quite resilient to these vulgarities and has learned to brush them off long ago,” Peskov said, according to Russia’s state-run Tass news agency.Peskov added that he had not seen the image in question, but would take a look at it and consult with the Ministry of Justice."
81,POLITICS,Devin Nunes’ Replacements Aren’t Exactly Eager To Investigate Trump-Russia Ties Either,Igor Bobic and Jessica Schulberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/house-intelligence-nunes-russia-trump_us_58e658f8e4b0917d3477f4b1,"GOP Reps.

Mike Conaway (R-Texas) will take over the House Intelligence Committee investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. He'll be assisted by Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) and Tom Rooney (R-Fla.).,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e66bf71500002000c7e4ed.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) announced on Thursday that he will temporarily step down from leading the panel’s investigation into Russian meddling in the U.S. election. But if Democrats and others are hoping this will enable a no-holds-barred examination of possible ties between the Kremlin and President Donald Trump’s campaign, they may be in for a bit of disappointment. Nunes’ decision to recuse himself came amid questions over his independence from the White House and his commitment to uncovering possible collusion between the Trump campaign team and Moscow. In his place, Reps. Mike Conaway (R-Texas) ― assisted by Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) and Tom Rooney (R-Fla.) ― will take control over the inquiry.The three men have voiced similar doubts about ties between Russia and the Trump administration.Last month, the House Intelligence Committee convened a high-profile public hearing in which members had the chance to question FBI Director James Comey and National Security Agency head Adm. Mike Rogers about the intelligence community’s assessment that Moscow interfered in the 2016 election to help Trump win. Conaway told the witnesses he was skeptical of the conclusion by 17 U.S. intelligence agencies that Russian President Vladimir Putin favored Trump.“The logic is because he really didn’t like candidate Clinton, that he automatically liked Trump. That assessment is based on what?” Conaway asked Comey.“It’s based on more than that, but part of it ... is the logic,” Comey said, before borrowing a sports metaphor. “Whoever the Red Raiders are playing, you want the Red Raiders to win. By definition, you want their opponents to lose.”“I know, but this says that you want her to lose, and him to win,” Conaway said of the assessment.Comey appeared perplexed. “They’re inseparable. It’s a two-person event,” Comey said.“When did you decide [Vladimir Putin] wanted him to win?” Conaway asked.“Logically, when he wanted her to lose,” Comey said, to laughter.Intelligence officials acknowledge that ascribing motive to an action is one of the harder parts of their jobs. But Conaway has cast doubt on whether the action in question ― Russian meddling in the election ― even took place. In an interview in January with the The Dallas Morning News, the congressman compared foreign cyber attacks and leaks targeting Democrats to efforts by the Democratic party to get out the vote among Latino communities in Nevada. He noted that Democrats last year brought in a famous Mexican singer and Mexican band as entertainment for a “fiesta” following the third presidential debate in Las Vegas.“Those are foreign actors, foreign people, influencing the vote in Nevada. You don’t hear the Democrats screaming and saying one word about that,” he said in an interview with The Dallas Morning News.Asked whether his example was truly on par with an unprecedented foreign intrusion into a U.S. election, Conaway replied, “Sure it is, it’s foreign influence. If we’re worried about foreign influence, let’s have the whole story.”The seven-term Texas congressman was a vocal Trump supporter during the presidential campaign, standing by him even after video emerged last year of Trump bragging about sexual assault. Conaway’s wife, Suzanne, also helped campaign for Trump in North Carolina.Gowdy, one of the panel members who will be assisting Conaway, honed his investigative skills as the head of the two-year, multi-million dollar probe into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s role in the Benghazi attacks ― which ultimately found no evidence of wrongdoing by Clinton. For all of Gowdy’s enthusiasm for investigating Clinton, he appears less concerned by the intelligence community’s assessment that Russia interfered in last year’s election in an effort to help Trump win.During last month’s hearing with Comey and Rogers, Gowdy used a significant portion of his allotted time to question the witnesses about the possibility of prosecuting journalists who publish classified information and their sources.“Is there an exception in the law for current or former U.S. officials requesting anonymity? Gowdy asked Comey, referring to a statute that forbids classified leaks. There is no exception for U.S. officials, Comey responded. “Is there an exception in the law for reporters who want to break a story?” Gowdy continued.Comey appeared unsure of how to respond. “That’s a harder question,” he said, explaining that it was not something that had been prosecuted in his lifetime. Rooney, the other committee member who will assist Conaway in leading the Russia investigation, is not a close Trump ally. Unlike Conaway and Gowdy, he withdrew his support for Trump in October when the video emerged of the then-candidate bragging about assaulting women.But in past comments, Rooney appears to have prejudged the outcome of his committee’s investigation. “We have zero evidence that the Russian government and Trump campaign coordinated in any way,” he told constituents at a town hall meeting last month.

82,POLITICS,Democrats Filibuster Donald Trump's Supreme Court Nominee,Jennifer Bendery and Michael McAuliff,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-filibuster-neil-gorsuch-supreme-court_us_58e65ab6e4b0917d3477f9da,It won't stop Neil Gorsuch from being confirmed. Republicans are expected to change the rules to force him through.,2017-04-06,Democrats succeeded in blocking Donald Trump's conservative Supreme Court nominee. But it was only temporary. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e65b0d16000021004d91e6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Democrats on Thursday followed through with their threats to filibuster Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, setting the stage for Republicans to unilaterally change the rules to force through his confirmation.Nearly all Democrats voted to block President Donald Trump’s court pick. They needed 41 to pull it off, and they had 44. Four Democrats sided with Republicans to end the filibuster: Sens. Michael Bennet (Colo.), Joe Donnelly (Ind.), Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.) and Joe Manchin (W.Va.).It was a dramatic move by Democrats, and one that their base was demanding from them. But it won’t have any effect on stopping Gorsuch. Republicans have been signaling for weeks that they are prepared to take the extreme step of blowing up Senate rules so it only takes 51 votes, instead of 60, to move forward on a Supreme Court nominee. There are 52 Republicans, so that would allow them to bypass Democrats and confirm Gorsuch themselves.Nobody likes the idea of changing the rules. It will be historic if the Senate waters down its rules so it only takes a simple majority to confirm Supreme Court nominees. But Republicans are determined to get Gorsuch through. Even GOP senators who said changing the rules will harm the Senate and the courts, such as Arizona Sen. John McCain, have said they will go along with the rules change.Ahead of the vote, senators in both parties chastised each other for dragging the Senate into such an ugly, partisan fight.“You know that he’ll be confirmed,” Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) scolded Democrats. “That’s why this is an especially sad state of affairs.”He called it “ridiculous” that Democrats would filibuster Gorsuch given his “outstanding qualifications” to be on the Supreme Court.Democrats pointed out that President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, also had outstanding qualifications, but Republicans refused to move his nomination forward all last year. Indeed, GOP senators’ arguments for why Gorsuch deserves an up-or-down vote echo the same arguments Democrats made last year for why Garland deserved a vote.“There must have been a hacking into his computer because he can’t print the name Merrick Garland to include in the speech … That name is the reason we are in this spot today,” Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said. “For the first time in the history of the Senate, for the first time ever, this Republican-led Senate refused to give this nominee a hearing and a vote. It had never, underline the word never, happened before.”Democrats have insisted their opposition is not simply partisan and that they are trying to block Gorsuch on principle. While they haven’t said he is unqualified, they have said he is too ideological, siding time and time again with big money interests over regular people.“His record shows, far from being the kind of mainstream candidate for the Supreme Court that could earn 60 votes, he may very well turn out to be one of the most conservative justices on the bench,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Thursday.Schumer said the answer was not to change Senate rules, but to come up with a nominee that at least eight Democrats could support."

Chris Coons said.",2017-04-06,Sen. Chris Coons tried to broker a deal to avert the nuclear option.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e68d251500002000c7e5a2.jpeg?ops=crop_106_13_3274_1400%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Senate Republicans on Thursday ignited the so-called nuclear option, lowering the effective threshold for Supreme Court nominees to be confirmed from 60 votes to a simple majority.It was a dramatic, albeit expected, step along the way to putting President Donald Trump’s nominee, Judge Neil Gorsuch, on the high court. And if the chamber had just waited another week or so, it could have been avoided. That’s according to one senator who was trying to broker a deal to stave off the nuclear option as recently as this week.In an interview with The Huffington Post, Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) said he had talks with about 12 to 15 fellow senators about preserving the filibuster in some form for Supreme Court nominees. While Republicans and Democrats couldn’t settle on the right formula for an agreement, he believed the impasse had more to do with scheduling than substance.“I think if you’d put 10 of us on a plane and sent us on a CODEL [congressional delegation] together to Afghanistan, by the time you came back you’d have had an agreement,” Coons said. “Maybe that just proves I’m an optimist.”But he said, “The amount of concern about the future of the Senate is that strong and ... the distractions of our very demanding schedules are that strong. I mean, it is very hard to catch people more than 5 minutes or 10 minutes here or there.”As the Gorsuch nomination battle unfolded, Coons was one of the few senators willing to be publicly associated with the idea of a bipartisan compromise. That came with a cost. The senator, who noted that he talked about his concerns with Democratic leadership and former Vice President Joe Biden, said he was targeted by liberal activists who opposed Gorsuch not only on jurisprudential grounds but because they believed the opportunity to fill the vacant seat had been stolen from President Barack Obama. Senate Republicans refused to hold a hearing, let alone a vote, on Obama’s nominee, Judge Merrick Garland.Beyond Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and John McCain (R-Ariz.), few Republicans were willing to talk publicly about a bipartisan compromise either. But Coons said “a half-dozen” members of the opposite party approached him privately with concerns and proposals.“At no point did a group of 10 senators sit down in a room, hand pieces of paper back and forth, look at each other, nod, and say, ‘Yes, we can sign this,’” Coons explained. “That never happened. But there were a lot of emails and phone calls. ‘Could you do this? Could you be comfortable with that? How about this?’”While more time may have led to an agreement, Coons conceded there were major hurdles to clear on the substance of any deal. Senators did propose nominating Garland alongside Gorsuch ― an idea literally cribbed from a “West Wing” episode ― but that proposal didn’t get far. A top GOP official in the Senate told HuffPost there was talk of confirming Gorsuch in exchange for codifying, in some way or another, the ability of Democrats to permanently block the next Supreme Court nominee, if they chose.One idea that gained some traction, according to Coons, involved lowering the filibuster threshold without eliminating it entirely. He described this as a “swap.” The Senate would restore the option to filibuster nominees to Cabinet and sub-Cabinet posts and district and circuit court seats ― which then-Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) had eliminated when he went nuclear in 2013. But instead of requiring 60 votes to break those filibusters, the bar would be dropped to 55 or 56. In exchange, the filibuster bar for Supreme Court nominees would also be lowered to 55 or 56. “Given the number of Democrats already committed to Gorsuch, you’d get him through and not have to change the rules” significantly for Supreme Court nominees, Coons explained. “There were a number of senators interested in that, but none that say, ‘Yeah, let’s take it.’”Ultimately, the pressure on lawmakers weighed far more toward creating a nuclear option confrontation than finding a deal to avert one. Outside groups weren’t the only people agitating for a standoff, Coons suggested. The senator said it was certainly his “impression” that “some folks in the Republican leadership didn’t want a negotiated solution” either.A Republican leadership aide dismissed that suspicion, saying that no deal was offered that would have been alluring enough that GOP leadership had to act to keep their members in line.“It didn’t require any discouragement not to take a bad deal,” the aide said.Want more updates from Sam Stein?

The musician and actress discussed the need for diversity in entertainment and advertising during a panel for Tina Brown’s Women in the World Summit on Thursday afternoon. Latfiah was joined by moderator Katie Couric, advertising executive Madonna Badger, Chief Brand Officer of AT&T Fiona Carter and Chief Brand Officer for P&G Marc Pritchard. After breaking through as a rap artist, Latifah said she began to realize the stark sexism so many women face in the music industry.“When you get to a record company and you realize that you’re not getting the same marketing dollars as your male counterparts in the same business — you’re already fighting,” she said. “You’re fighting, number one, to be a female rapper. You’re fighting to get the same dollars and marketing that your male counterparts would get, an uphill battle. I was always fighting from the beginning, so getting in a comfortable position to fight was no big deal — let’s go, who want it?”Once Latifah got into a position of power, she realized she needed to represent the underserved communities she used to be a part of. This time, it was through her influence as an executive producer. “I could make a movie like Beauty Shop, that shows a woman just trying to become a successful beautician against all odds and employ other people,” she said. “Each one of these things is an opportunity to make change, and it doesn’t have to be huge but each little step and choosing to show that image of a woman trying to make it with a young child and being able to go against all odds and be able to pull it off, those are the women I know and their story needs to be told.”Toward the end of the panel, Latifah asked the audience to also remember our young boys when it comes to fighting sexism across industries.“We have to think about our young men and we have to think about some of the pressures we’re putting on them,” she said. “It is about women and the power that we have and what we deserve, but we also have to think about the images we’re putting out there for our young men. And some of our grown men are apparently still boys and they need to get the proper re-education about how to look at women.” Watch the full 30-minute panel below. "

The list of hard-hit states also includes California, New Jersey and Illinois, carried by Democrat Hillary Clinton.The report is the latest in a long-running assault on the centerpiece of a Republican tax reform plan, backed by House Speaker Paul Ryan, from a network of groups associated with the billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch, who are major supporters of conservative political candidates and causes.Opposition to the border adjustment tax, or BAT, from the Kochs and import-dependent industries suggests a rocky road ahead for Trump’s next top priority: passing the biggest tax reform package since the Reagan era.The Koch network also opposed Trump’s failed health care legislation, pledging campaign support for conservative lawmakers who refused to vote for the bill last month.BAT is already opposed by a number of Senate Republicans who could prevent its passage, should the House approve a tax reform bill that contains it. The Koch report’s state-by-state breakdown could help reinforce opposition among House and Senate lawmakers.The proposed tax would exempt U.S. export revenues from federal corporate tax but levy an implicit 20 percent tax on imports by preventing U.S. companies from deducting the cost of imported goods and supplies.Koch organizations, including the brothers’ privately held conglomerate Koch Industries, have warned that the border adjustment tax could devastate the U.S. economy by raising prices on consumer goods, including gasoline.The groups made their assessment by comparing the value of each state’s 2014 imports to its gross domestic product.The Koch groups say they support tax reform but oppose BAT. Refineries owned by Koch Industries rely on oil imports from Canada."

With their endless jabs that have often concealed sober criticisms, shows like “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,” “The Daily Show,” “Jimmy Kimmel Live!,” “Full Frontal With Samantha Bee” and “Saturday Night Live” have provided their audiences a way to laugh off political anxiety.If a labor dispute between networks and studios and the Writers Guild of America continues, however, all of those shows will immediately go off the air over nine years after a writers’ strike disrupted production on dozens of shows, a union official stated in a letter provided to The Huffington Post.The strike would begin May 2, the day after the entertainment writers’ current contract with The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents their employers, expires.WGA West executive director David Young sent the letter to media buyers, who purchase time slots to run commercials on TV networks, warning that the potential strike could affect programming for the 2017 to 2018 TV season. (Late-night shows, which reflect the issues of the day, would be affected instantly.) A writers’ strike that lasts for months would not benefit advertisers, as networks would be forced to adjust their schedules to include reruns or other, less popular programming. The letter comes as media buyers prepare for upfronts, a period where networks debut their upcoming programming at large galas to sell commercial space.Unlike the writers’ strike that began in November 2007, however, this protest would fall during many shows’ summer breaks, Deadline points out. That’d leave mainly late-night shows vulnerable to production disruptions, although Young warned that any delays in production caused by a strike could easily “postpone fall season premieres and reduce the amount of new programming available to advertisers and audiences.”Young added that “some scripted series scheduled to air in the summer of 2017 may be affected” by a strike, too, on shows where production is currently ongoing.The WGA represents 12,000 writers in the entertainment industry who produce content for traditional networks and online services including Netflix. The Huffington Post is unionized under the auspices of the WGA-East.Union members claim their pay has declined in recent years as networks produce shorter TV seasons because of a shift in television trends: While many of today’s popular shows include just around a dozen episodes, they take a similar amount of time to write as traditional, two-dozen-episode seasons. Writers, then, end up with less compensation.Late last month, WGA called for a strike authorization vote, which is set to take place April 19, per Variety. If passed, the vote would give the union authority to enact a strike.Earlier this week, the AMPTP issued a response to ongoing criticisms by the writer’s organization, stating, per Variety, “Our objective continues to be to reach an agreement with the WGA at the bargaining table.”The 2007 strike lasted 100 days, ending in February 2008, as writers sought a larger share of digital revenue.

90,POLITICS,Bipartisan Opposition To Trump's Water Cuts Is Already Growing,Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/usda-rural-water-cuts-letter_us_58e66122e4b0773c0d3ebc2c,Dozens of Democrats and Republicans in Congress are fighting cuts to a program that rural communities rely on for clean water.,2017-04-06,Rural communities voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump in November. Now a key program that supports the safety of their water is at risk.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e681092c00006268ff2abe.jpeg?cache=cQyDYxGBs0&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump plans to eliminate a popular federal program that helps small, rural communities — many of them Trump strongholds — to upgrade and maintain their water infrastructure systems. But his plan just got a bit more complicated.This week, a bipartisan group of more than 60 U.S. representatives issued a letter to the House’s Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, writing in defense of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s water and wastewater loan and grant program.The letter, signed by 49 Democrats and 13 Republicans as of Wednesday, calls for increased funding of the USDA rural water program, arguing that it and two other related initiatives are “essential in helping small and rural communities overcome their limitations in providing safe and affordable drinking water and sanitation.”A failure to protect the program, the letter says, would result in “irreparable and long lasting harm to these water systems and the Americans who rely on them.”In a statement, Mike Keegan, a spokesman for the National Rural Water Association, applauded the lawmakers who signed the letter ― a group led by Reps. Colleen Hanabusa (D-Hawaii) and John Katko (R-N.Y.) ― and expressed optimism that a majority of Congress would also back the threatened program.“This federal initiative is a priority for [a] very diverse and large group of members of Congress, both regionally and politically,” Keegan noted in the statement, “and I think that bipartisan and broad support projects very positively for Congress funding the initiative this year.”The USDA program, last funded with an annual budget of $498 million, was deemed “duplicative” of the Environmental Protection Agency’s state revolving water funds in Trump’s budget blueprint. The document called on small, rural water utilities otherwise served by the USDA program to turn to the EPA revolving funds, which are slated for a slight budget increase, for help.But rural advocates like Keegan note that the EPA programs have typically allocated the bulk of their funding — as much as 77 percent — to larger, urban water systems. And smaller systems are less enticing candidates for private financing because they often lack the resources to repay the loans at the interest rates and on the payment schedules that private institutions prefer.This makes the USDA program these utilities’ best — and often only — shot at support, as evidenced by its high level of demand. The lawmakers’ letter notes that the program already has a backlog of 805 applications from utilities requesting a total of $2.2 billion in loans and grants.Leaving these small utilities to compete with larger systems for EPA revolving funds would leave many struggling to get the help they need to comply with federal standards, advocates say.As seen in recent investigations, many of these utilities are already struggling to do just that, and their customers are paying the price.“Elimination of the USDA rural water program will disproportionately impact the most economically disadvantaged communities in the country,” Keegan noted.Other USDA initiatives are also slated to take a hard hit under the president’s budget blueprint, and rural communities would feel the brunt of the proposed 21 percent reduction in spending.Among the additional cuts are $95 million in funding from supposedly “duplicative and underperforming” programs at the agency’s Rural Business and Cooperative Service, which provides job training and supports business development in rural communities.Sonny Perdue, Trump’s nominee for agriculture secretary, could also play a part in determining the fate of initiatives like the water program.In his confirmation hearing before the Senate’s Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee last month, Perdue appeared to share multiple senators’ concerns about the administration’s proposed cuts to the agency.The former Georgia governor vowed to be a “strong and tenacious advocate” for farmers and small towns, though he did not speak in detail about any of the proposed cuts at USDA.Perdue’s nomination is scheduled for a vote on April 24, following the conclusion of a two-week congressional recess.―Joseph Erbentraut covers promising innovations and challenges in the areas of food, water, agriculture and our climate.

91,POLITICS,Alaska Lawmakers Shut Down Colleague Who Opposed A Bill Honoring Black WWII Soldiers,Dana Liebelson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/an-alaska-republican-opposed-a-bill-honoring-black-wwii-soldiers-so-his-colleagues-from-both-parties-shut-him-down_us_58e67d5ce4b0773c0d3ef1a3,“This is part of our history.”,2017-04-06,A photo from 1942 shows black soldiers working on the Alaska Highway. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e67e6f1500002100c7e55d.jpeg?cache=boKeNEdwNa&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― When a Republican lawmaker in Alaska opposed a bill commemorating black soldiers who helped build the Alaska Highway during World War II, his colleagues from both sides of the aisle called out his views for being misguided. State Rep. David Eastman (R) represents Wasilla, the town that once claimed failed vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin as its mayor. Eastman, a freshman lawmaker who previously served in Afghanistan, gave an impassioned speech on Wednesday to fight against a bill establishing Oct. 25 as a day to officially honor African-American soldiers who worked on the road stretching more than 1,000 miles from British Columbia to Alaska. The Army assigned thousands of soldiers to construct the highway during World War II, with the aim of connecting the contiguous U.S. to Alaska. The state was considered a potential Japanese target at the time. The Army was still segregated, and black soldiers were typically relegated to non-combat duties at the beginning of the war. The black soldiers working on the road construction project faced open racism and weren’t given the same resources as white soldiers to forge through the harsh terrain.Katrina Beverly Gill, the daughter of one of the black soldiers who built the highway, testified that her father “had to endure the treacherous weather while living in substandard conditions such as living in tents with ice approximately one inch thick on the inside while white soldiers lived in buildings.”Still, black soldiers surpassed the government’s expectations. Historians have pointed to the project as one of the events that facilitated the military’s subsequent desegregation, according to The New York Times. The U.S. government has referred to the highway as “the road to civil rights.”But Eastman said a bill honoring those accomplishments didn’t honor everyone who contributed to the highway. “Let us recognize those veterans for their service, not the color of their skin,” he said, later adding that “we don’t recognize African-American Firefighter Day, and I don’t think we should.”State Sen. David Wilson (R), who is also from Wasilla, introduced the bill, which passed the Alaska Senate unanimously last month. It passed 39-1 in the House on Wednesday, with Eastman the only lawmaker to vote against it. Prior to casting their ballots, a number of lawmakers took time to explain why they thought Eastman was wrong. “I don’t have a rousing speech prepared,” said state Rep. Delena Johnson (R-Palmer). “I think we should recognize mistakes we made in the past, and to ignore them would be a mistake.”The bill acknowledges that “the government made that racial division,” she added, noting that “these people that the government already separated out did a fabulous job.”House Majority Leader Chris Tuck, a Democrat, pointed out that black soldiers had to use hand tools and sleep in tents when it was colder than 20 degrees below zero. The bill is “recognizing people who have not had the same recognition,” he said. The history has “been almost skipped over,” added Rep. Geran Tarr (D-Anchorage), who noted that the official 759-page U.S. Army history of the Corps of Engineers only recognizes African-American troop involvement in a one-sentence footnote.In response to questions from The Huffington Post, Eastman pointed to a Facebook post he wrote defending his vote. “There is nothing right about elevating one group of Americans at the expense of another,” it reads. But his colleagues aren’t buying it. “I, too, was not inclined to speak on this bill,” said state Rep. Matt Claman (D-Anchorage). “I remember my father and my two uncles who both served in WWII, and they served in segregated units, they would want us to vote yes.” Republican state Rep. Gabrielle Ledoux added, “this is part of our history.” "
92,POLITICS,House Republicans Were Handed A Historic Opportunity. They're Blowing It.,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-trouble-governing-vacation_us_58e6aef4e4b0cdad578e49b9,"But from the GOP's angle, ""It's going great!""",2017-04-06,"House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) holds a news conference after a House Republican Conference meeting April 4. He says the legislative timeline has ""lots of flexibility built in.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e6b2fa16000020004d9377.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― House lawmakers are heading out of town for two weeks with a health care bill in tatters, a government funding deadline looming, and a White House and congressional leadership apparently unable to find consensus or face reality. But, according to House Republicans, everything is just fine.“It’s going great! We’re making America great again,” Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.) told The Huffington Post on Thursday when asked how things in the House were going.That appears to be the honest assessment of Republicans right now. They aren’t bothered by their inability to pass a health care bill, or by Trump or Speaker Paul Ryan’s sinking poll numbers, or by the unprecedented dollars flowing into Democratic candidates’ coffers. And they firmly believe that, yes, they will find agreement on health care. Any day now.“We’re making progress on all those things,” Rep. Jody Hice (R-Ga.) said. “When you have a bill that’s not ready for prime time, the best thing for the American people is that we back up and get it right.”Time and again, Republicans praised leadership for slowing down the health care debate, and they insisted that no part of their agenda had slipped.Even Speaker Ryan (R-Wis.), who presented Republicans with a timeline at the beginning of the year that had them finished with their health care bill before the Easter break, said Republicans were still on schedule.“We have in our timeline lots of flexibility built in,” Ryan said. “You know why? Because we have to work with the United States Senate.”But all the flexibility on timing won’t account for the inflexibility of Ryan’s conference. Conservatives insist the GOP health care bill eliminate regulations that protect people with pre-existing conditions from being charged more for insurance. Moderates have said they can’t go along with that. And Republicans appear to have no way to break those disagreements.If Republicans really do insist on passing health care, it’s easy to see how their entire agenda could be foiled. There are only 47 legislative days before the August recess after House Republicans return from their April break. The omnibus spending bill will chew up the first week of the schedule. Then, if they somehow broke the logjam, they’d still have to debate and pass their health care bill. And then pass another budget ― which doesn’t look like it’ll be automatic ― so they can do tax reform. And then Republicans would actually have to do tax reform, an issue that has evaded Republicans arguably for the last 30 years.And they’re supposed to pass a massive infrastructure bill. And a defense supplement. And 12 appropriation bills.Things are certain to slip.Meanwhile, the White House already appears to be lashing out at Ryan, unable to accept that he and other congressional leaders can’t just make Republicans pass the health care bill.In the sense that Republicans aren’t being jammed into voting on a bill with a 17% approval rating, maybe lawmakers have a right to be encouraged.For Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.), Republicans pumping the brakes on their health care legislation is a good sign.“It’s weird to be worried about not rushing enough, which is what they seem to be worried about,” Amash said Thursday. “We should take our time with it.”But there’s still no evidence Republicans can bridge the divide in their conference on much of anything. Lawmakers appear no closer to passage than they were two weeks ago when GOP leaders pulled the health care bill from the floor, and members are heading back to their districts for two weeks. Presumably, dissatisfaction with what Republicans are discussing will further drive the conference away from a functional majority.One of the most noteworthy critics of Republicans has been reliable Republican Rep. Tom Rooney of Florida. He recently told The Atlantic that, if Republicans can’t accomplish something, then it’s hard to justify why they’re in power.“I’ve been here for eight years,” Rooney told HuffPost on Wednesday. “And for the Republican Party, we need to start passing bills that are positive, rather than just being an opposition or stopping things from happening.”Again, however, most Republicans haven’t given up hope on their health care bill.“Most people that I talk to realize that health care is the biggest problem in America,” freshman Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.) said Thursday. “It was a problem before Obamacare. It’s gotten worse after Obamacare. And they realize it’s not going to be solved in a matter of a few weeks; it’s going to be a several month process.”One member who spoke on the condition he not be identified said that, although there were conservatives and other members who were “not happy” with Ryan, no one seemed to be talking about a coup.“It is not Paul Ryan’s fault at all,” Rep. Buddy Carter (R-Ga.) said. “This is just simply the process.”When Hice was asked at what point Republicans would start clamoring for leadership changes, he said, “We’re not at that point.”But reality is about to smack Republicans in the face.The odds of them actually repealing and replacing Obamacare look worse every day. When they return from their Easter break, they’ll have four legislative days to debate and pass an omnibus spending bill that no one has seen ― with obvious pitfalls all over the legislation. (Will the omnibus fund Planned Parenthood? Will it fund a border wall? How much money above previously set spending caps can Congress accept?)And, unlike the health care bill, Republicans need Democratic votes ― at least in the Senate ― to get a spending measure to President Donald Trump’s desk. If conservatives insist on funding the border wall and Democrats say no, who will blink first? And whose side will Trump be on?While there are easy criticisms you could make of Ryan, senior GOP aides were eager to point out that, ultimately, the GOP’s inability to get anything done was a reflection on Trump.“Despite what Paul Ryan’s detractors think, at the end of the day, this is Donald Trump’s Washington now,” one senior GOP aide said.“You can’t just come in 24 hours before a vote, make some phone calls and expect anything to change,” the aide continued, referring to the ill-fated health care bill.“Paul Ryan is the only thing holding this place together. It’s just one distraction after another.”One distraction has been Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes and his questionable Russia probe. After Nunes seemed to be coordinating with the White House, the California Republican stepped aside from leading the investigation on Thursday. Aides ask how those sorts of wounds are Ryan’s fault.For Democrats, the answer is easy: Everything is a reflection of the speaker.“They’re in the majority,” Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) said Thursday. “Speaker Ryan is the speaker. So one would think if they want to get something done, they would lead to get something done. And that’s not what they’re doing.”Other Democrats were happy to pile on and point out how poorly things are going for House Republicans. “The definition of dysfunction” is how Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) described the House GOP conference.“They can’t govern,” said Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.). “I mean, they may have more members of the House and more members of the Senate, but one thing they don’t have is a majority.”Democrats urged Republicans to reach across the aisle to work out legislation.“It’s not the House of Republicans; it’s the House of Representatives,” Rep. Scott Peters (D-Calif.) told HuffPost. “And if they want to solve these problems, they might as well talk to a few Democrats.”He added that the answer on health care was obvious: “If they want to deal with real problems, they can sit down with some of us. I see more of Speaker Ryan on TV than I do in the chamber.”But Republicans, miraculously, blame Democrats for not working with them. Natural Resources Committee Chairman Rob Bishop (R-Utah) said Thursday that it was difficult for Republicans to pass legislation because “you have the other side of the aisle that refuses to do anything whatsoever.”“Not an idea, nothing, not even a vote,” he continued.When it was pointed out that Republicans didn’t seek input from Democrats on the health care bill ― they literally hid the bill from their counterparts, adopted zero of their amendments and Ryan proudly said he didn’t want to work with the other side ― Bishop called it “cute spin.”“Our side did go. And they refused to do anything,” he said.Bishop implored Democrats to come up with a health care alternative, and he said it was one of the “sad elements” of the Affordable Care Act that Democrats didn’t come to them in 2010 when Congress was working through Obamacare.That line of attack doesn’t exactly square with reality. Democrats point out that President Barack Obama held summits with Republicans, Congress debated the health care bill for over a year and more than 100 Republican amendments were ultimately incorporated into the bill.Lee even suggested she was a little uncomfortable with how much Obama was asking for their ideas and incorporating their input. “Oftentimes I would just not have to say anything,” she said.There is a growing chorus of moderate Republicans who say Republicans should reach across the aisle. Tuesday Group Chairman Charlie Dent (R-Pa.) suggested on Wednesday that working with Democrats was the best path forward for health care, and Rep. Leonard Lance (R-N.J.) essentially said the same thing.That continues to be an option of last resort, however, partially because Republicans are holding out hope that they can come together and partially because leaders know it would further weaken them.That dynamic isn’t exactly new, but with the implosion of the health care bill, it’s maybe worse than ever. Still, aides didn’t think much had changed.When one senior GOP aide was asked for comment on this story, the aide shrugged it off.“Sounds like your story is a real barn burner, but the barn has been on fire for seven years now,” he said."
