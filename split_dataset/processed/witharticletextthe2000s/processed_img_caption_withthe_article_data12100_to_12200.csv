(REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/596213912100003400fc5f99.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(Reuters) - A few dozen Ku Klux Klan members and supporters shouted “white power” at a rally on Saturday in Charlottesville, Virginia where they protested against a city council decision to remove a statute honoring Confederate General Robert E. Lee.The group was guarded by scores of police and outnumbered by hundreds of counter-protesters who waved signs denouncing racism. Anti-KKK protesters raised their voices in chants and shouts, drowning out speeches from the white supremacists, live video feeds on social media showed.There were no initial reports of violence at the rally that lasted less than an hour. The Klan group that brandished Confederate flags and signs with anti-Semitic messages was separated from crowds by a ring of fencing and a heavy police presence.Later police fired tear gas cannisters when some protesters refused orders to disperse. Twenty-three people were arrested, but officials could not confirm their affiliations.In February, the Charlottesville City Council voted 3-2 to remove the statue from the park once named for Lee and make plans for a new memorial to remember the southern city’s enslaved population, The Daily Progress, the local newspaper reported.At least one person who participated in the Klan rally against the statute removal could be seen with a holstered pistol.Confederacy statues and flags have been removed from public spaces across the United States since 2015, after a white supremacist murdered nine black parishioners at a South Carolina church.Critics of the monuments say they foster racism by celebrating leaders of the Confederacy in the pro-slavery South during the U.S. Civil War. Supporters say they represent an indelible part of U.S. history and part of regional heritage.The bronze figures of Lee and his horse, Traveller, atop an oval-shaped granite pedestal has been in the park for nearly a century, the city of Charlottesville said.Torch-wielding white nationalists rallied in the college town that is home to the University of Virginia’s flagship campus in May to protest the move. A legal battle is going on over the statue’s removal and no date has been set.(Reporting by Jon Herskovitz and Chris Michaud; Editing by Alistair Bell and Himani Sarkar)"
1,POLITICS,"Trump's Voter Fraud Investigation Is A Mess, But It's Still Frightening",Sam Levine,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kris-kobach-donald-trump-voter-fraud_us_5960efe9e4b0d5b458eac01d,"States are rebelling, a commissioner resigned and the panel is facing legal scrutiny.",2017-07-09,Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R) is the vice chairman of the Presidential Advisory Commission On Election Integrity. The panel's work so far has been chaotic.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5960f5071500002000bfca32.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When the 10 members of President Donald Trump’s Presidential Advisory Commission On Election Integrity met each other for the first time during a June 28 conference call, Vice President Mike Pence and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R), the panel’s leaders, made it clear they wanted the committee’s work to be unbiased. That same day, Kobach sent a letter to all 50 states, requesting any “publicly available” information on voters, including highly sensitive information such as their voting history, information regarding felony convictions and the last four digits of their Social Security numbers. The letter immediately prompted a bipartisan backlash as Democratic and Republican election officials declined to provide sensitive voter information. The White House has tried to downplay resistance to the probe, releasing a statement saying reports that nearly every state was resisting the probe were “fake news.”Now, after less than two weeks of activity, the commission, convened after Trump’s unsubstantiated claim millions voted illegally last year, is under fire before it has even looked at a single voter file. The backlash has undermined the work of commissioners, as election officials have openly questioned why the commission needs highly sensitive personal information. Trump himself has also undermined the suggestion the probe was convened to look broadly at confidence in elections, calling it a “voter fraud panel” in a tweet.A member of the commission has mysteriously resigned, and the panel is already facing legal challenges.Despite the chaos of the commission’s first days, its direction is scary.Kobach’s ultimate goal appears to be weakening the 1993 National Voter Registration Act. The law mandates certain state agencies provide citizens with the opportunity to register to vote and outlines specific conditions states must meet before removing people from the voting rolls. On the same day Kobach sent a letter to states requesting voter information, the Department of Justice also quietly asked 44 states to send them information on their compliance with that act ― a request many said signaled the department was gearing up to force states to kick people off their rolls.Kobach has described the refusals to hand over voter “data” as idiotic, but it’s clear the commission’s work so far has been at best sloppy. In some cases, Kobach didn’t send the letter to the agency that oversees elections in the state. In his initial letter, Kobach told states any documents they gave to the commission would be turned over to the public, but later said in a court filing that no identifiable voter data would be released. He also told states they could submit information through email or a secure file exchange, but amid a lawsuit about security concerns, said the email option applied only to non-sensitive responses. Many have expressed alarm that the commission hasn’t offered a careful and thoughtful plan for storing what will essentially be a national database of voters, particularly after Russian hackers penetrated the U.S. election last year.The White House revealed this week that the committee intends to compare the voter data it collects against federal databases (it has not said which ones) to try to flag people who are registered to vote in multiple places as well as dead and non-citizens who are on the voting rolls. Such an effort could produce unreliable results. The Department of Homeland Security has warned its database of noncitizens is not a reliable way to verify voter rolls.And Kobach has championed a similar program to compare voter rolls between states, called Crosscheck, for years, but it’s known to produce a lot of false positives and flag people who have similar identifying details but are otherwise eligible to vote. One recent study found the Crosscheck program identified 200 false positives for every instance of double registration it found.Michael McDonald, a political science professor at the University of Florida, suggested in an interview with Slate that Kobach intentionally made a request he knew states couldn’t answer without passing legislation to allow it to be shared.“They wanted to make an argument that these states were hiding their data so they could conceal the massive voter fraud that, if uncovered, would legitimize Trump’s claim of 3 million to 5 million fraudulent votes. Kobach set the states up. He knew many wouldn’t be able to respond,” he said.The commission will meet in person for the first time on July 19 in Washington, D.C. The public will be allowed to watch only via a livestream."

3,POLITICS,Sheriff In Heart Of Ohio's Opioid Epidemic Refuses To Carry Overdose Reversal Drug,Nick Wing,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/richard-jones-butler-county_us_595fb129e4b02e9bdb0c3b78,More than 150 people died of heroin- or fentanyl-related overdoses in Butler County last year.,2017-07-08,"Many police officers now carry naloxone overdose reversal kits like this, but not in the Butler County Sheriff's Department.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/596005da2100003400fc5e08.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Drug overdose is the leading cause of death in Butler County, Ohio, but Sheriff Richard Jones says he has no plans to equip his deputies with naloxone, an opioid overdose reversal drug that saves hundreds, if not thousands, of lives around the country every day.Jones, a vocal supporter of President Donald Trump who has expressed skepticism about naloxone in the past, reiterated his opposition in a recent interview with the Cincinnati Enquirer. Reached by HuffPost on Friday, he stood by his comments.“My officers don’t carry Narcan, nor will they,” Jones said, referring to a brand name of naloxone, which is typically administered nasally and works by essentially blocking the opioid receptors that heroin, fentanyl and other narcotic painkillers target.Jones cited high costs and concerns about officer safety, noting that some overdose victims revived with naloxone can be unpredictable and hostile.In a recent interview with Ashleigh Banfield on HLN’s “Primetime Justice,” Jones said his position would change only if “the courts order” him to begin carrying naloxone.Jones has made a name for himself as an outspoken advocate for a variety of extreme anti-drug views, including once suggesting the U.S. should drop one of its largest bombs on Mexican drug cartels. He told HuffPost that most of the responses he’d gotten to his latest remarks on naloxone were positive, from people “disgusted by the drug problem” and tired of inaction from national politicians.“This Narcan, all it does is save people’s lives for another day,” said Jones. “You enable these people when you give them this Narcan.”Jones said he disagrees with experts who say addiction is a disease, and is frustrated because “nothing that is being done is fixing the problem.” He said he’s seen an increase in the number of women giving birth to opioid-addicted babies in jail and heard countless horror stories about young children being directly affected by the ravages of addiction. He also described speaking with one man who’d been using intravenous drugs for so long that he now had to inject them into his penis in order to find a vein.Jones noted that just because his deputies won’t carry naloxone doesn’t mean overdose victims won’t get revived.“The life squads aren’t just going to stop giving them Narcan, but it’s pushing the resources out so bad and our government has no response, they have no cure, they’re all too busy,” said Jones. “Nancy Reagan, as silly as it might sound, you gotta just say no and you gotta teach kids and you gotta start in the 7th grade.”Butler County is now the only sheriff’s department in Southwest Ohio not equipped with naloxone, according to the Enquirer. Advocates have been working with the Butler County Health Department to give free overdose reversal kits and training to relatives and friends of people struggling with addiction, as well as users themselves, who are often nearest to the scene of an overdose.Southwest Ohio has been hit especially hard by the opioid epidemic in recent years, with some counties seeing exponential growth in overdose deaths amid an influx of increasingly powerful opioids. Nearly 200 people in Butler County died of drug overdoses last year, with 153 related to heroin or fentanyl, a potent synthetic opioid that along with other analogues has fueled surging drug deaths around the nation. The county is on pace to see 263 overdose deaths this year, according to a June report by The New York Times. In neighboring Montgomery County, overdoses will claim 800 lives this year if they continue at the current rate.The crisis has led to some differing opinions on how best to respond. Last month, a city councilman in Middletown, which is located in both Butler and Warren counties, asked officials to explore the possibility of denying emergency medical services to certain individuals who had sought a medical intervention twice before.“I want to send a message to the world that you don’t want to come to Middletown to overdose because someone might not come with Narcan and save your life,” said Middletown council member Dan Picard. “We need to put a fear about overdosing in Middletown.”Picard expressed concern about the mounting cost of overdose reversal kits, citing estimates showing the city is on pace to spend 10 times the amount it had initially budgeted for naloxone in 2017. Middletown officials have since said emergency medical services personnel will continue to revive overdose victims.In Ohio and around the country, officials have been giving voice to similar forms of compassion fatigue. Some have suggested that death is a foregone conclusion for many people addicted to opioids, and that reviving them repeatedly is therefore not worth the resources.These positions may speak to the deep frustration of communities in the grips of the opioid epidemic, but drug policy advocates say they’re not representative of most officials in charge of responding to it.“We see a lot of consistency and buy-in from law enforcement, fire and EMS on the importance of overdose response and harm reduction, and the importance of an enhanced overdose response,” Kelly Firesheets, senior program officer at the Cincinnati-based Interact for Health, told HuffPost.“There are hundreds if not thousands of departments that are now carrying naloxone and are happy to carry it because they generally say it’s a good thing for the communities and for the officers, because they like being able to do something at the scene of an overdose,” said Corey Davis, deputy director for the Network for Public Health Law, which supports increased access to naloxone.Interact for Health takes a “naloxone-plus approach” to dealing with overdoses, treating overdoses as opportunities for intervention and to connect victims to treatment.“A lot of times we get confused and forget that naloxone is not treatment for addiction,” said Firesheets. “This is a crisis intervention we’re talking about ― we’re talking about keeping a person from dying. And then there are other systems and processes and services that people need as treatment for the disease that is threatening their lives.”Firesheets also expressed concern that Jones’ decision not to equip officers with naloxone would limit the department’s ability to protect deputies who may come into contact with a number of synthetic opioids, some of which are so lethal that amounts equivalent to just a few grains of salt can be deadly.There have been numerous instances in recent months, including in Ohio, of officers being revived with Narcan after accidentally touching synthetic opioids and overdosing. Jones said the emergency medical personnel who typically respond to overdoses along with his officers would be able to administer naloxone should that happen.To Firesheets and others, Jones’ remarks are evidence of the lasting stigma around addiction, which has become deeply engrained amid 40-plus years of the U.S.-led war on drugs. One of the chief policy prescriptions of this era has been that law enforcement should be a primary solution to drug use.“The humanness of this sometimes gets lost in our discussion about policy and practices,” said Firesheets. “These are real people with families and friends and kids and co-workers, and they’re part of our community. That makes this challenging to wrestle with sometimes.”The views of people like Jones show that police shouldn’t be leading the public health policy response to the overdose epidemic, said Michael Collins, deputy director of the Drug Policy Alliance, a nonprofit that advocates for the progressive reform of drug laws.“They’re not social workers, they’re not doctors, and so they’re often not best equipped to deal with the challenges of drug use,” Collins told HuffPost. “Police will not get us out of the overdose epidemic. There has to be a public health approach, and it has to be an approach that’s grounded in science and health and human rights and not enforcement.”Although treatment is a vital part of this equation, people have to be ready to get treatment, said Collins.“We have to recognize that there are individuals who aren’t ready for treatment, don’t want treatment right now, aren’t willing to get treatment, and the question is, how do you reduce the harm associated with their drug use?” he said.Collins brought up proposals like syringe exchange programs and safe-injection facilities, both of which have shown promising results, and both of which Jones told HuffPost he’s skeptical of.Although these programs can be opportunities to connect drug users to treatment, Collins believes that even if they don’t succeed in getting people to seek help, it doesn’t mean they’ve failed.“The bar for the success of all these interventions shouldn’t be have we gotten the user into treatment, it should be have we saved their lives?” he said."
4,POLITICS,"The Death Penalty And Mercy: Dear Governors, Can You Spare A Pardon?","Austin Sarat, ContributorWilliam Nelson Cromwell Professor of Jurisprudence & Political...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-death-penalty-and-mercy-dear-governors-can-you_us_5960eaeae4b0cf3c8e8d58f6,William Morva was executed by the state of Virginia last Thursday. He became the 14th person to be executed this year and,2017-07-08,"<p> Convicted murderer William Morva, right, talks with his attorney Tony Anderson, in Washington County Circuit Court in Abingdon Va. March 13, 2008. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5960ec4e18000020006734c6.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"William Morva was executed by the state of Virginia last Thursday. He became the 14th person to be executed this year and the 1,456th person put to death since 1976, when the United States resumed using capital punishment.Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe turned down Morva's request for clemency Thursday afternoon. Morva asked for mercy because he suffers from serious mental illness, and because the jury that sentenced him was not correctly informed about his condition. McAuliffe received pleas to spare Morva's life from the daughter of one of his victims, from 18 Virginia state legislators and from the United Nations.McAuliffe said he believed Morva had received a fair trial, and that mental health professionals testified that they didn't believe his mental illness prevented him from understanding his crimes.McAuliffe's decision is another indication that the well-established power of governors to spare life is in danger of withering from lack of use. I've studied the history of clemency in capital cases from 1900 to the present. At the start of the 20th century, my research shows, governors regularly used this power in capital cases. In some cases, governors stayed executions because they had moral objections to capital punishment; in others, they believed condemned prisoners had been rehabilitated while on death row; or they wanted to remedy some injustice that had not been recognized or addressed by the courts.Indeed, by the middle of the century, as many as 1 in 5 death row inmates received a commutation or a pardon.Yet all this changed with the dawn of the “law and order/ tough on crime era” in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Since 1976, governors have granted clemency in 282 death cases. But that number hides the actual infrequency of clemency. Most of those 282 cases — 171 — came from a single decision, by Illinois Gov. George Ryan, in 2003. He granted clemency to everyone on that state’s death row, as he questioned the fairness of the capital punishment system.Not only has there been a decline in the use of clemency in capital cases, but, with few exceptions, governors now use that power only when there is evidence that a death row inmate has been falsely convicted or the sentencing process was demonstrably flawed. As a result, they are reluctant to spare the lives of people like Morva. He was sentenced to death for murdering two people in 2006 during an attempt to escape after he had been jailed for attempted robbery. While there, he showed many symptoms of mental illness, including paranoia and detachment from reality. When he committed the murders, he was suffering from a delusional disorder which led him to believe that his life was in danger. He told his mother in a phone call just before his escape attempt, “Someone wants me to die.”Like McAuliffe, neither the jury in his trial nor the court which heard his appeal believed that he suffered from a “true mental illness.” However, even if they had, it is unlikely that they would have spared Morva’s life.In capital trials, evidence of mental illness is frequently introduced by the defense to persuade juries not to hand down a death sentence. However, jurors often know little about mental illness and do not fully understand its links to criminal behavior. Widespread misperceptions about mental illness mean that the mentally ill murderer is often seen as uncontrollable, potentially dangerous and, because of his illness, likely to be violent in the future. The result is that a disproportionate number of mentally ill murderers end up on death row.Writing about clemency almost 200 years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court described it as “an act of grace, proceeding from the power entrusted with the execution of the laws.” Governors don’t see it that way. As George W. Bush outlined his view of the clemency power when he was governor of Texas, “In every case, I would ask: Is there any doubt about this individual’s guilt or innocence? And, have the courts had ample opportunity to review all the legal issues in this case?”McAuliffe embraced Bush’s view. He commuted a death sentence to life imprisonment only once, earlier this year, because jurors heard false information in the sentencing phase of the trial.McAuliffe says he is morally opposed to the death penalty, but that he must enforce the laws of his state, even if he disagrees with them.McAuliffe’s excuse rings hollow. In Virginia, as elsewhere, the death penalty is never mandatory, and a governor may stop an execution any time he believes it is right to do so. As the Florida State Supreme Court once wrote, “An executive may grant a pardon for good reasons or bad, or for any reason at all, and his act is final and irrevocable.”Those in whom the clemency power is lodged must exercise their own moral judgment in deciding whether and when to spare life. The citizens of Virginia and of the United States are entitled to that exercise of judgment.And, they are entitled to ask whether we are better off when someone as ill as William Morva is put to death.I think that the answer is clearly no. Mentally ill killers deserve mercy, not death.And all of us deserve to live in a society in which mercy does not disappear in cases where lives are on the line.Originally published by Cognoscenti on July 6, 2017"

Everybody knows that they’re not just meddling in the United States’ election,” Haley said in an interview on CNN’s “State of the Union” that is set to air Sunday morning.“They’re doing this across multiple continents, and they’re doing this in a way that they’re trying to cause chaos within the countries,” she continued, according to a transcript of the exchange released by the network. Haley’s certainty is a striking contrast with Trump’s remarks on the matter during a trip to Poland on Thursday.“I think it could very well have been Russia, but I think it could well have been other countries,” Trump said at a joint news conference in Warsaw with Polish President Andrzej Duda. It is not clear when CNN taped its interview with Haley. But it was undoubtedly after Trump’s comments in Poland. CNN host Dana Bash asked Haley about details of Trump’s meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which occurred on Friday at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany.The Trump administration and the Kremlin have offered somewhat different accounts on the two leaders’ discussion about the question of Russian electoral interference. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who was also present at the meeting, said that Trump pressed Putin more than once on the Russian government’s role in the hacking and selective leaking of sensitive e-mails that U.S. intelligence agencies believe the Kremlin masterminded to undermine Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton’s presidential bid. At the same time, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov claimed Trump accepted Putin’s denial of any Russian involvement. And Tillerson said “there was not a lot of relitigating of the past” during the two leaders’ discussion.Haley, who has taken a firm line against several Russian policies from her perch at the U.N., claimed Trump did not tread lightly on the matter.“What he did was bring up right away the election meddling, and he did that for a reason,” Haley told CNN. “One, he wanted him to basically look him in the eye, let him know that yes, we know you meddled in our elections. Yes, we know you did it, cut it out. And I think President Putin did exactly what we thought he would do, which is deny it. This is Russia trying to save face. And they can’t.”Asked why Trump has publicly equivocated about Russia’s role in the election meddling, Haley deferred to the president.“You can ask him,” she said. “Everybody’s trying to nitpick what he says and what he doesn’t, but talk is one thing. Actions are another. He confronted President Putin. He made it the first thing that he talked about. And I think we have to now see where it goes from here.”Haley has diverged from White House talking points on at least one other occasion in the past. In June, Haley told CNN that “Trump believes the climate is changing. And he believes pollutants are part of that equation.” Prior to that, White House press secretary Sean Spicer and Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt had avoided clarifying Trump’s views on climate change. Trump had previously described climate change as a hoax perpetrated by China and “bullshit.”"

Dr. Travis Bradberry offers 16 ways you can make your workplace a happy one.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59541c012900003a003b19f4.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Let’s face it, happiness and work do not tend to go hand in hand. A 2013 Gallup study, which reported data from more than 180 million people, found that just 13% of us consider ourselves to be “happily engaged at work.”Those who do rate themselves as happy are 36% more motivated, six times more energized, and twice as productive as their unhappy counterparts.The good news is that just 50% of happiness is influenced by genetics—the rest is up to you.When it comes to making yourself happy, you need to learn what works for you. Once you discover this, everything else tends to fall into place. And making yourself happy doesn’t just improve your performance; it’s also good for your health.A critical skill set that happy people tend to have in common is emotional intelligence (EQ). At TalentSmart, we’ve tested the EQs of more than a million people and know what makes high EQ people tick. So, we went digging until we found 16 great ways that emotionally intelligent people create their own happiness at work.1. Remember That You Are In Charge of Your Own HappinessYou have two choices in any dead-end job: find another one or make the most of the one you’re stuck with. Either way, your happiness is up to you and no one else. Remind yourself of this anytime you’re feeling stuck.2. Don’t Obsess over Things You Can’t ControlIt’s good to know how Greece’s economic troubles might affect US markets or that your company could merge with its largest competitor, but there’s a big difference between understanding these larger forces and worrying about them. Happy people are ready and informed, but they don’t allow themselves to fret over things that are beyond their pay grades.3. Don’t Compare Yourself to Other PeopleWhen your sense of pleasure and satisfaction are derived from comparing yourself to others, you are no longer the master of your own happiness. When you feel good about something that you’ve done, don’t allow anyone’s opinions or accomplishments take that away from you.While it’s impossible to turn off your reactions to what others think of you, you don’t have to compare yourself to others, and you can always take people’s opinions with a grain of salt. That way, no matter what other people are thinking or doing, your self-worth comes from within. Regardless of what people think of you at any particular moment, one thing is certain—you’re never as good or bad as they say you are.4. Reward YourselfWorking hard is important, but never allowing yourself to take a break is detrimental to your happiness. A study of radiologists found that they made more accurate diagnoses when they received small rewards prior to reviewing patients’ charts. A Cornell study found that small rewards make people more generous, friendly, and happy. These small “thrills” also made people more productive and accurate in their work. Rewards activate the pleasure pathway in your brain, even if they are self-induced. Effective rewards can be small things such as taking a walk down the hall or eating a snack.5. Exercise During the Work WeekGetting your body moving for as little as 10 minutes releases GABA, a soothing neurotransmitter that also limits impulsivity. A University of Bristol study showed that people who exercised on workdays reported improvements in time management, mood, and performance. The benefits of exercise always outweigh the time lost in its pursuit.6. Don’t Judge and GossipJudging other people and speaking poorly of them is a lot like overindulging in a decadent dessert; it feels good while you’re doing it, but afterwards, you feel guilty and sick. When you’re tempted to speak of someone else in a way that might be negative, just ask yourself if you’d want someone saying the same about you.7. Choose Your Battles WiselyEmotionally intelligent people know how important it is to live to fight another day. In conflict, unchecked emotion makes you dig your heels in and fight the kind of battle that can leave you severely damaged and unhappy for some time to come. When you read and respond to your emotions, you’re able to choose your battles wisely and only stand your ground when the time is right.8. Stay True to YourselfCrossing moral boundaries in the name of success is a sure-fire path to unhappiness. Violating your personal standards creates feelings of regret, dissatisfaction, and demotivation. Know when to stand your ground and express dissent when someone wants you to do something that you know you shouldn’t. When you’re feeling confused, take some time to review your values and write them down. This will help you to locate your moral compass.9. Clear the ClutterI don’t need to remind you of how much time you spend at work. Take a good look at your workspace. You should create a space that’s soothing and uplifting. Whether it’s a picture of your family, a plant, or an award that you’re proud of, display them prominently to keep them on your mind. Get rid of the junk and clutter that hold no significance and do nothing positive for your mental state.10. Give Someone A HandTaking the time to help your colleagues not only makes them happy, but it also makes you happy. Helping other people gives you a surge of oxytocin, serotonin, and dopamine, all of which create good feelings. In a Harvard study, employees who helped others were 10 times more likely to be focused at work and 40% more likely to get a promotion. The same study showed that people who consistently provided social support were the most likely to be happy during times of high stress. As long as you make certain that you aren’t overcommitting yourself, helping others is sure to have a positive influence on your happiness.11. Let Your Strengths Flow A University of Chicago study of peak performance found that people who were able to reach an intense state of focus, called flow, reaped massive benefits. Flow is the state of mind in which you find yourself completely engrossed in a project or task, and you lose awareness of the passage of time and other external distractions. Flow is often described as an exhilarating state in which you feel euphoria and mastery simultaneously. The result is not just happiness and productivity but also the development of new skills through a heightened state of learning. The key to reaching flow lies in organizing your tasks such that you have immediate and clear goals to pursue that play to your strengths. As you begin working on these tasks, your focus increases along with your feelings of adequacy. In time, you reach a flow state, in which productivity and happiness flourish. Set clear goals each day and experiment with task order until you find the secret formula that gets you flowing.12. Smile and Laugh MoreA study at Mannheim University in Germany demonstrated that we can actually manipulate our emotions by changing our facial expressions. One group of participants held a pen in their mouth horizontally, which forces a smile. When asked to rate how funny a cartoon was, the participants holding pens in their mouths found the cartoons much funnier than participants without pens.As the study shows, it doesn’t matter if your smile is genuine because your facial expression can precede the feeling. If you find yourself in a negative spiral at work, slow down and smile or watch a funny video on YouTube. This mood boost can turn your day around.13. Stay Away From Negative PeopleComplainers and negative people are bad news because they wallow in their problems and fail to focus on solutions. They want people to join their pity party so that they can feel better about themselves. People often feel pressure to listen to complainers because they don’t want to be seen as callous or rude, but there’s a fine line between lending a sympathetic ear and getting sucked into their negative emotional spirals. You can avoid getting drawn in only by setting limits and distancing yourself when necessary. Think of it this way: If a person were smoking, would you sit there all afternoon inhaling the second-hand smoke? You’d distance yourself, and you should do the same with negative people. A great way to set limits is to ask them how they intend to fix their problems. The complainer will then either quiet down or redirect the conversation in a productive direction.14. Laugh at YourselfWhen you take yourself too seriously at work your happiness and performance suffer. Don’t be afraid to show a little vulnerability. Something as simple as laughing at yourself draws people to you because it shows them that you’re humble and grounded (it also keeps them from laughing behind your back). Happy people balance their self-confidence with a good sense of humor and humility.15. Cultivate an Attitude of GratitudeIt’s all too easy to get caught up in things that could have been different or didn’t turn out the way you wanted them to. Sometimes the best way to pull your mind away from negativity is to step back and contemplate what you’re grateful for. Taking time to reflect on the good in your life improves your mood because it reduces the stress hormone cortisol by 23%. Research conducted at the University of California, Davis, found that people who worked daily to cultivate an attitude of gratitude experienced improved mood, energy, and physical well being.16. Believe the Best Is Yet to ComeDon’t just tell yourself that the best is yet to come—believe it. Having a positive, optimistic outlook on the future doesn’t just make you happier; it also improves your performance by increasing your sense of self-efficacy. The mind has a tendency to magnify past pleasure to such a great degree that the present pales in comparison. This phenomenon can make you lose faith in the power of the future to outdo what you’ve already experienced. Don’t be fooled. Believe in the great things the future has in store.Bringing It All TogetherApplying these strategies won’t just improve your happiness at work; most of them will also improve your emotional intelligence. Pick those that resonate with you and have fun with them. And please share what makes you happy at work in the comments section.Want to learn more from me?

8,POLITICS,Former Congresswoman Pens Emotional Plea To Colleagues For Affordable Health Care,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donna-edwards-multiple-sclerosis-health-care-letter_us_5960de92e4b0615b9e91cbe8,Maryland Democrat Donna Edwards revealed that she has multiple sclerosis.,2017-07-08,"Maryland Democrat Donna Edwards left Congress in 2016 after a failed bid for the Democratic Senate nomination. On Saturday, she revealed that she has multiple sclerosis.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5960dfa01500006303bfca2a.jpeg?cache=eC3H47OSp2&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In an open letter revealing she has multiple sclerosis, a former congresswoman appealed to her congressional colleagues to consider her story when deciding whether to repeal the Affordable Care Act.Former Rep. Donna Edwards (D-Md.) argued in the letter, published Friday evening in The Washington Post, that the Republican attempts to repeal the landmark law endanger her personally given both her medical condition and the economically precarious position in which she finds herself. Edwards made the case that her diagnosis of a chronic illness despite having a healthy lifestyle demonstrates the importance of protecting people with pre-existing conditions.“I pray that as you finish doing whatever it is that you are doing with health care, you remember that I was one of your colleagues, that I worked hard and that I don’t have a preexisting condition because I was a bad person who led an unhealthy life,” she concluded the missive. “I have a preexisting condition simply because I do; and I, like millions of other Americans in the same situation, deserve quality, affordable health care.”Edwards described a life as an avid runner and biker, who began experiencing muscular pains last year that she would later learn were symptoms of the autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis. While she was participating in a Democratic sit-in for gun control legislation on the House floor in June 2016, a House physician called her into his office and told her the diagnosis. Though she was shaken, Edwards recalled, she returned to the sit-in.Edwards, a senior fellow at New York University School of Law’s Brennan Center for Justice, nonetheless described herself as “not employed.” She currently pays $800 in COBRA payments to keep the health insurance she had as a member of Congress, but that option will run out in June 2018.“I’m not sure what I’ll do then,” Edwards wrote.Edwards, who is a single mother, recounted that her financial struggles as a young woman prevented her from affording coverage for a time. Now, Edwards wrote, she again has a personal stake in the debate.“One reason I ran for Congress was to help make sure no one would have to go through that, and I was proud to be one of the presiding officers when the Affordable Care Act passed. I did not think the law was perfect; I believed it was a good start,” she wrote. “I never thought I could have to go back to a time when I would not have health-care coverage.”Edwards, a progressive stalwart, ran for an open Maryland Senate seat in 2016. She lost in the Democratic primary to fellow Maryland congressman Chris Van Hollen, who went on to win in the general election. She subsequently retired from the U.S. House, where she had served since 2008.As an attorney, veteran liberal activist and former member of Congress, Edwards’ career prospects ― and consequent opportunities to receive employer-sponsored insurance ― would appear to be bright.But many other Americans in her predicament would not be as fortunate without the ACA, commonly known as Obamacare. Obamacare ensured that insurance companies could not deny people coverage for preexisting conditions and created community rating regulations requiring insurers to set premiums regionally, rather than based on individuals’ medical histories.It also enabled workers living above the poverty line without coverage from their employers to purchase insurance on regulated exchanges. The vast majority of people who buy that coverage benefit from major financial subsidies available to Americans below a certain income threshold.The Obamacare repeal bill currently being considered by the Republican-dominated Senate would dramatically reduce the subsidies available to Americans who purchase coverage on the exchanges. Much of the savings from those reductions and massive cuts to Medicaid would go toward the cost of undoing taxes on the wealthy and corporations that were part of Obamacare.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that as a result of the changes in the Senate bill, 22 million fewer Americans would have insurance over a ten-year period. That is only a modest improvement over a bill that passed the House in May, which CBO projects would result in 23 million fewer insured Americans.The CBO score of the bill late last month spooked many Republicans, prompting Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to delay a vote until after the July Fourth congressional recess."
9,POLITICS,Can California Assemblyman/Surfer Travis Allen Ride A Wave Of Voter Discontent Into The Governor's Office?,"Chris Epting, ContributorAuthor and award-winning journalist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/can-california-assemblymansurfer-travis-allen-ride_us_595ef401e4b085e766b5118c,"Back in 2013, as a newspaper columnist for the Los Angeles Times here in Huntington Beach California, I took up a cause. For",2017-07-08,<p>CA Assemblyman Travis Allen with his wife and daughter.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59624fb718000020006735ec.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Back in 2013, as a newspaper columnist for the Los Angeles Times here in Huntington Beach California, I took up a cause. For years up until then I had focused on little-known human interest stories and lots of local history. However, when I learned that the South Coast Air Quality Management District (AQMD) was making a move to ban fire rings all across Southern California, I became a man on a mission. Over the course of more than a dozen columns, I documented and fought against what I (and many others) considered to be draconian tactics that would’ve eliminated one of the most wonderful aspects of California beach culture: beach bonfires.The battle of the bonfiresThe AQMD governing board, nothing more than a bunch of political appointees with lots of power and apparently way too much time, was apparently trying to appease a couple of wealthy property owners that were put off by the sweet scent of the nearby evening beach bonfires. Now, that may not seem like a big deal or cause to fight for. But understand, here in Huntington Beach, we have more than 600 of these fire rings. They are not just an evocative and lovely part of the beach experience and heritage; they are also a significant part of our local economy. People pay to park on the beach at night to enjoy these fires. They buy tons of marshmallows and graham crackers and chocolate bars and hot dogs to enjoy near these fires. It amounts to millions of dollars each summer for our local economy. But, perhaps most importantly, the beach bonfire experience is something that brings people together. It’s a low-cost way for families of any and all financial means to enjoy something truly special. So I took up the fight and began what became an epic battle.That said, a man with a newspaper column can only do so much and so the day I was contacted by Assemblyman Travis Allen (whose district includes all or portions of Seal Beach, Huntington Beach, Fountain Valley and Garden Grove), I felt both relief and exhilaration. “I’ve watched what you are doing and I want to help,” he told me enthusiastically. “This is wrong. As a Californian, I want to help you fight this. We are doing this, dude. I’m getting involved.”And get involved he did. Travis and I worked closely together to protect and preserve fire rings all over the state and thankfully, they are all still here. But he took things further than I could have and what I saw in him was truly inspiring. This issue brought together people of every political persuasion. I’ve never seen anything like it. It was a common sense fight and Travis fought like a warrior, rallying and unifying and galvanizing a community, regardless of political differences.He also introduced AB 1102, which was designed to ""protect the Southern California tradition of beach bonfires by requiring the South Coast Air Quality Management District to work with local cities and other coastal oversight agencies to prove that there will be no loss of beach access or harm to local economies and that any environmental concerns are addressed before a city can remove the fire rings from the beaches in Orange and Los Angeles counties.""Travis throws his hat in the raceWhen I heard that he recently threw his hat in the ring to become the next Governor of California, I was happy. In general, I am wary of politicians and I rarely, if ever, express much public opinion in support of them. But we are living in serious times here in the Golden State.When I started reading about his campaign, it reminded me of all of his passion and enthusiasm on the fire ring issue. The New York Times profiled Allen the other day, and the piece included this quote:“I’m a Southern California surfer and investment adviser for 20 years. I first ran for office in 2012 because I had seen my family, my clients and their business leave the state. My best friend moved to Texas. But I believe that California’s best days are ahead of us if only we had real leadership once again.”I remember Travis telling me the same thing several years ago. About how his family had left, too. It was just getting too hard to make it here and that bothered him intensely. He is a native Californian.A piece in the Sacramento Bee included this:Travis Allen, a conservative assemblyman from Orange County, said Thursday that he plans to enter next year’s contest for California governor. Allen, who announced his intentions to his large social media following, could pair his uphill candidacy with his existing proposal to repeal the recently signed $52 billion vehicle tax and fee package designed to pay for the state’s aging roads and transportation projects. “I’ve seen our taxes increase to be among the highest in the nation,” Allen said in his announcement, where he also bemoaned the rise in crime and general expansion of state government bureaucracy. Ready to fight backI hadn’t spoken with Allen for a while so we got on the phone shortly after I read about his announcement.Just as he was on the fire rings issue, his enthusiasm, confidence and passion crackled over the line. I mentioned to him that a lot of people will probably dismiss any chance of a Republican taking over the seat. He laughed and told me, “I’m not worried about that at all. This whole myth of ‘democratic dominance’ is perpetuated by them. They run a political machine out of San Francisco and you have to look no further than Jerry Brown, Gavin Newsom, Barbara Boxer, Dianne Feinstein - to see what is going on - it’s all out of San Francisco. It reminds me of what Tammany Hall must have been like in New York City; a well-oiled political machine that is out of touch with honest, hard-working Californians. We’re paying our highest taxes in ages, schools are failing, they want single-payer healthcare and sanctuary cities - I just don’t think that’s what most Californians want.”He was born near San Diego and has lived throughout the state, including the last 20 years or so in Huntington Beach. He’s driven by the surf and his love of the water plays into his own personal politics. “As a surfer, I want clean beaches and clean water and clean air. That’s not extreme environmentalism, it’s just common sense. A lot of this stuff is just common sense. People get so hung up on party loyalty but sometimes I think they forget just look at their lives and wonder, how can I vote to make this better? How can I help take back my beautiful state?”I get what he’s saying. When I look at Travis and his record, I think less about him being a conservative Republican and more simply him just being a concerned Californian. And the voting numbers in a blue state don’t scare him.“That’s just another myth,” he says. “Last election for governor we had 10 million registered voters who didn’t go out to the polls. They simply didn’t vote. If 700,000 people have voted differently, you could’ve had a Republican governor. That’s all. What matters is taking back the state and fixing what is wrong. We have the sixth largest economy in the world and look how high our poverty rate is. We have more water than we can ever use, but no way to store it. I believe we have the best workforce in the nation but our roads are terrible and we have the worst traffic in the country. As a financial advisor for over two decades, I know firsthand how to make tough financial choices. Our 13.3% income tax rate is the highest in the nation. Our state sales tax of 7.25% is also the highest in the nation – and when you factor in local taxes, sales tax in some cities can reach as high as 10%. We also pay among the highest gas taxes and highest car registration fees in the nation. Let’s not forget we also have to repeal Jerry Brown’s gas tax and cut taxes for all Californians. I’m running for governor to help fix these things on behalf of the people.”Can he really do it?With a new baby on the way this November, it’s an exciting time for Allen, his wife and their eight-year-old daughter. And things will only get more crazy in the next few months. “It’s all good,” he laughs. “I wouldn’t be doing this if I wasn’t ready to deal with everything this experience is going to bring. I find it really exciting and I’m ready to get to work. I’m committed to help lead this state back to where it needs to be.”Allen is a social media maven who knows how to communicate with the electorate. He (like his wife) speaks fluent Spanish which is certainly an asset in California. In my opinion he seems as qualified, if not more so, than anyone else currently in the pack. I’ve written about eight books on California and literally hundreds of articles. But outside of my book on Teddy Roosevelt and my fire ring fight, I don’t usually write about politics or politicians. It’s not what I do. But the more I see what happening here, the more it feels like it’s time to take a stand. I love this state and I think it’s time the people start to take it back. I’ve been talking to a lot of friends recently about local politics. Some on the right and some on the left. Everybody seems to agree. Things could be better in California. A lot better. And that maybe it’s time to rethink the way things have been getting done, regardless of political party. Is the answer a passionate local Assemblyman who loves to surf? Who loves his state and is tired of so many moving away in frustration? I can just tell you firsthand, I’ve seen this guy fight for what he believes in and I’ve seen him pull people together. Even when we don’t agree on certain issues, the debates are fair, honest and open minded. He listens. Whatever the game, when they choose up sides, you want this guy on your team. The first written documentation of surfing in Hawaii was written by the English explorer Captain James Cook in 1778. He was the first European to visit Hawaii and this is how he summed up what he observed: “I could not help concluding this man had the most supreme pleasure while he was driven so fast and so smoothly by the sea.”I see that same quality in Travis Allen not just in how he talks about surfing, but also in his passion to help take back California from politicians that have ignored the most basic needs, wants and dreams of an increasingly frustrated electorate.I am anxious and excited to see how his campaign develops."
10,WEIRD NEWS,Praying Mantises Are Killing Birds And Eating Their Brains Worldwide,Hilary Hanson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/praying-mantises-eating-birds-brains_us_59610ff4e4b0d5b458eac95e,"Mostly hummingbirds, based on the documented cases.",2017-07-08,A mantis eats a black-chinned hummingbird in Colorado.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5961108d2100003700fc5ee5.jpeg?cache=VoemhqQiTz&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Nature is beautiful, but it can be kind of messed up.As an illustration, we’ll refer you to a press release this week from Switzerland’s University of Basel, titled “Praying Mantises Hunt Down Birds Worldwide.” Carnivorous mantises feed most frequently on insects or spiders, but zoologists from Switzerland and the United States have published research indicating that mantises also kill and devour small birds on all the continents except Antarctica.For those unaware that praying mantises eat small birds, this news is surely alarming. But honestly, the title of the press release doesn’t convey the true horror of the situation.Newsweek did some additional reporting, interviewing two scientists (unaffiliated with the research) who told them about the method mantises typically employ in their avian consumption.The mantises usually “pierce the skull to feed on brain tissue,” said biologist William Brown of the State University of New York at Fredonia.Retired ecologist Dietrich Mebs also provided some color about the process.“They just hold [their prey], and they eat them while they are still alive, slowly and slowly until there is nothing left,” he told Newsweek.Great!So how did the zoologists determine this is a worldwide phenomenon? Live Science explains that researchers pored through records — including published studies, academic papers and even social media posts — to find records of mantises capturing birds. In all, they found 147 documented cases, spanning 13 countries. The earliest case they include was from 1864, but 67 percent of the cases were between 2000 and 2015.Since they were relying only on cases documented by humans, it was tough to determine exactly how often mantises eat birds. But the researchers’ most relevant finding was that mantises engage in the behavior all over the world.The most frequently documented victims of the mantises were ruby-throated hummingbirds in the United States. More than 70 percent of the cases found were mantises eating hummingbirds in the U.S., often when the birds were visiting hummingbird feeders or home gardens. (Since people often watch their feeders at home, it also makes sense people would be easily able to document these cases.)In their press release, researchers link the high proportion of hummingbird encounters to several non-native species of large mantises that people released across North America decades ago in an attempt at “pest control.” They note there are also native mantises that prey on birds.A quick Google search shows plenty of people still release mantises in the hopes they’ll eat insects such as aphids and flies. The downside is that they also consume creatures people want to have around, like butterflies and, yes, sometimes hummingbirds.“Our study shows the threat mantises pose to some bird populations,” Martin Nyffeler, the lead author of the study, said in a statement. “Thus, great caution is advised when releasing mantises for pest control.”"

Their aim is to assist local students in the difficult task of finding resources in war-torn Syria.ISTANBUL – The sight of people sifting through rubble – searching for survivors of an attack or rummaging for belongings – is not uncommon in rebel-held parts of Daraa province. But in the southern Syrian town of Inkhel, roughly 34 miles (55km) north of Daraa city, a group of volunteers is scavenging for something else entirely.Since the start of this year, teachers and volunteers have collected roughly 7,000 books from houses and libraries destroyed by Syrian government attacks in the rural town in Daraa. Rather than letting them wither away in moldy cellars or stuffy storage rooms, the rescued volumes are being used to stock the newly founded Ajyal Public Library.“The main goals of the library are to fight the regime with education … and serve college students in opposition-controlled areas,” Loai Abu Abdou, a 34-year-old math teacher and one of the founders of Ajyal (Generations), told Syria Deeply.Rebel-held parts of Daraa, once the seat of 2011 protests against Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, have been the target of an intense government campaign over the past two months. Roughly 600 barrel bombs, 200 airstrikes and 91 napalm bombs have been dropped on the province in the first two weeks of June alone, according to estimates by Syrian Civil Defense, also known as the White Helmets.Inkhil, classified by archaeologists as one of the most important ancient towns in the Houran Plain and one of it oldest inhabited cities, has been hit hard by the government’s aerial campaign. But enthusiasts in the town cling to life as they dodge shells and bullets to preserve what remains of the town’s cultural legacy.Qassem al-Jabawi, a 40-year-old judge, was aong the dozens of volunteers who helped collect books in Inkhil. He told Syria Deeply that the books were collected from dangerous areas “where the bombing rarely stops,” and that the volunteers’ goal was to preserve the books and protect them from damage.According to Jabawi, most of the books currently in the library were rescued from the Inkhil Cultural Center, which he said had been devastated by years of war.Syrian troops used the center in 2012 as a base for operations against Inkhil’s rebel groups. Videos posted on social media networks in 2012 showed sniper positions set up on its roof and along its walls. Another video published in 2013 by a rebel-run media outfit showed the center in tatters after it was captured by opposition groups, who went on to use it as a military base.By March of this year – just three months after collection efforts began – volunteers from the Dawn of Syrian Women Association and the Ajyal Educational Foundation had managed to collect 7,000 books from the center and other damaged areas. The Ajyal Library was opened that same month, carrying books on just about every subject imaginable. And volunteers continue to dig through the rubble to salvage yet more texts.The library helps students navigate the maddening maze of finding books in war-torn Syria, particularly in Daraa’s countryside, where libraries are scarce. The reality of the conflict means that it is not easy for students to travel between different parts of the province to get the resources they need for their studies. This pressing need for reading material among students in Daraa’s countryside was the main impetus behind the initiative.“The project began when a college student was looking for sources to write a paper for a class, but could not find what he needed,” Hayat al-Abd, director of the Dawn of Syrian Women Association and another of the library’s cofounders, told Syria Deeply.“People can now borrow books for free. An identification card is deposited until the book is returned to the library. The center relies solely on volunteers, and is open from 8 a.m. to 12 p.m.,” she explained.While students may be the primary target of this initiative, teachers and instructors in rural Daraa have also gained from the project.“In light of the scarcity of libraries in the liberated areas in rural Daraa, and because it is very hard to download books online due to poor internet connections, this library is a gem for me,” said Abdul Rahman al-Naser, a 31-year-old Arabic teacher.Naser added that the library attracts a plethora of people from other villages in the area, especially students from the nearby city of Nawa, roughly 12 miles (20km) south of Inkhil. Though the library stocks books on Arabic grammar and syntax as well as classical Arabic literature, Naser has opted instead for books on Roman, Greek and Islamic civilizations. “I am interested in the history and traditions of old civilizations,” he said.As well as providing access to books, the library also organizes workshops and seminars for students in rural Daraa province.Earlier in June, the library’s Facebook page announced a number of summer classes and seminars for high-school students in the area, covering topics such as chemistry, math, English, communications and Arabic, among others. The seminars and courses were slated to start on June 18 and will run for most of the summer.The founders now hope to further develop the library by securing missing volumes and equipping the center with additional tables and storage, making it easier and faster for visitors to find the books they need.This article originally appeared on Syria Deeply.

Vardaman was the governor of Mississippi from 1904 to 1908.“As an educational institution, it is imperative we foster a learning environment and fulfill our mission by pursuing knowledge and understanding,” Chancellor Jeffrey Vitter said in a news release.Ole Miss famously became embroiled in racial tension and violence in 1962, when James Meredith became the first black student to attend the institution as the result of court-ordered integration.The move is part of an ongoing process on the campus to reconcile with its past, provide historical context, and create a more welcoming environment for a diverse student body. In recent years, the university has had several instances of racism, including a 2015 incident in which a noose was placed around the neck of a James Meredith statue on campus."

But County Commissioner Les Miller said he has recently see a “major groundswell of people who want it removed.” That now includes the Rays and Tampa Bay Mayor Bob Buckhorn. “We understand and believe that these decisions belong in the hands of elected officials,” the team said in a statement sent to the Tampa Bay Times. “At the same time, we are supportive of its removal from the courthouse.”The monument, “Memoria in Aeterna,” honors the soldiers of the Confederate States of America, according to the Historical Marker Database. Last month, county commissioners decided, 4-3, to keep the monument. But Miller said he plans to ask his colleagues again to remove the monument when they are set to meet July 19.During the monument’s dedication in 1911 to a crowd of 5,000, the keynote speaker called blacks “an ignorant and inferior race,” according to the Tampa Bay Times.“There have been people that said it’s a slap in the face to everyone,” Miller told the publication. “To put a mural showing diversity behind a monument constructed in 1911 and the person made the comments that blacks were inferior, that does not make any sense at all.”The Rays are considering moving from their current location in St. Petersburg to Tampa, and the monument’s removal could sway their decision. Part of the team’s criteria is choosing a site with “iconic elements that positively impact the ballpark brand, the brand of the team and the image of the region.”A monument to racism is not part of that image, the team has decided."

But a new bill could soon allow even us mere peasants to enjoy the same luxury as New Jersey’s Republican Gov. Chris Christie.A new bill introduced Friday by Democratic Assemblyman John Wisniewski would allow the public to rent out Christie’s Island Beach State Park home. The bill comes after photos surfaced of the governor lounging with his family on a beach that he had shut down to the public because of a budget standoff. NJ.com photojournalist Andrew Mills captured Christie from a private plane after making two passes.The governor later denied being on the beach, saying he “didn’t get any sun.” “That wasn’t true,” Mills said in a piece about the incident. “And we had the irrefutable evidence.”Christie spokesman Brian Murray then backtracked by saying Christie “did not get any sun. He had a baseball hat on.”On Monday, Christie stood by his decision to post up on the beach he closed to everyone else.“I don’t apologize for it,” Christie said at a press conference. “I don’t back away from it. I think my poll numbers show I don’t care about political optics.”Christie’s poll numbers have plummeted in recent months, with The Washington Post reporting that “by mid-June of this year, his net approval rating was a stunning minus-66, with only 15 percent of the state viewing his job performance positively.”A second bill would also prevent any New Jersey governor from using the beach house during a state shutdown."

Just under 80,000 people were ordered to evacuate, down from more than 400,000 at the peak of the rains, with tens of thousands more advised to leave their homes.“At first, it wasn’t raining that much,” said Sumie Umeyo, a resident of Asakura.“But they spoke of record-breaking rain and it started raining heavily, then they began closing the roads. We looked outside and the roads were like rivers,” Umeyo said. Around 12,300 soldiers, policemen and firemen waded through mud and climbed over piles of splintered wood to reach several hundred people cut off by landslides. Large boulders and uprooted trees littered the landscape.Fukuoka and neighboring Oita, the hardest hit by the rain, are both largely rural prefectures but rivers were also rising in the city of Kitakyushu, which has a population of some 950,000 and issued evacuation orders for several districts. The rain was caused by a low pressure area over the Pacific that fed warm, moist air into Japan’s seasonal rainy front.(Writing by Elaine Lies; Editing by Paul Tait)"

An estimated 100,000 demonstrators acted peacefully, Reuters reported.The extent of the damage remains unclear at this time.The rallies have resulted in the injury of nearly 200 officers ― some of whom were reportedly attacked with metal bars ― and led to more than 80 arrests so far, according to Hamburg authorities, who requested reinforcement to support the tens of thousands of police workers already on duty. Dressed in riot gear, they deployed water cannons, smoke grenades, tear gas and armored vehicles to quash the protests.Under the motto “Welcome To Hell,” far-left demonstrators protested against global capitalism and the leadership of U.S. President Donald Trump, who is attending the summit, as well as the lack of global initiative on climate change.Members of the anti-capitalist movement, Black Bloc, were visible in Thursday’s clashes, HuffPost Germany political correspondent Jurgen Klockner reported.“I have every understanding for peaceful demonstrations,” German Chancellor Angela Merkel said, condemning the violence. “But violent demonstrations put human lives in danger.”U.S. first lady Melania Trump was also denied police clearance to partake in a tour of Hamburg as tensions escalated on Friday.“Half the city is burning,” HuffPost Germany journalist Maximilian Marquardt said during a Facebook Live report from the scene in Schanzenviertel, a district nearby. “I think the worst is still to come,” he added, standing in front of flames in the street. Police have since urged people to leave the area.“The situation here is getting very, very tense. People are building street barriers in order to stop the police,” Marquardt said, before he was hit by tear gas.Earlier in the day, a 70-year-old woman told HuffPost Germany she had hoped Friday would be calmer, following Thursday’s clashes.“I never experienced something like this,” she said.“It is very difficult for the police, because we stand between politicians and protesters,” a policeman told HuffPost. “We cannot please both of them.”Take a look at some of the photos from Friday below.HuffPost Germany’s Leonhard Landes contributed reporting."

That refers only to the narrative responses,” he said in the court filing.A White House official elaborated on the filing, saying the “narrative responses” refer to seven questions Kobach posed to state officials about election administration, and that the commission “will not release any personally identifiable information to the public.”Republican and Democratic election officials have expressed skepticism over Kobach’s request for publicly available voter roll data. Some states have outright refused to comply, while others say they will only provide information that is already public. A few officials have said they are barred by state law from sharing any information from the public.The Kobach filing came in response to a request by the Electronic Privacy Information Center for a federal judge to issue a temporary restraining order against the commission. In justifying their request to stop the committee’s work, EPIC lawyers argued the commission hasn’t conducted a legally required privacy impact assessment. Collecting this kind of information, lawyers argued, could cause “irreparable injury” because the commission does not have a secure way of storing voters’ data.Bob Gellman, a privacy consultant who worked on Freedom of Information Act issues on Capitol Hill for two decades, said he believed the commission was not subject to FOIA because it was not an agency and its purpose was to advise the president. While Gellman believes the commission has discretion to choose what kind of information to release, it’s less clear what public disclosure obligations they have under the 1972 Federal Advisory Committee Act, a separate law.Regardless of whether personal details are released, building a massive national database of voter data would raise serious privacy and security concerns, said William McGeveran, a privacy expert and professor at the University of Minnesota Law School.“One of the reasons that a lot of privacy advocates are concerned is that they keep changing their story about what they’re collecting, what they’re releasing and how they’re storing it,” McGeveran told HuffPost. “As a matter of just sound judgment, information that includes things like [the] last four digits of Social Security needs to be held in a really secure way. And the more information like that you aggregate together, the more attractive a target it is for hackers.”Michael Chertoff, the former secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, voiced a similar concern in a Washington Post op-ed on Wednesday, arguing that compiling a massive amount of voter information in one place could pose a national security threat.In his initial letter to states, Kobach said officials could “submit your responses electronically to ElectionIntegrityStaff@ovp.eop.gov or by utilizing the Safe Access File Exchange (‘SAFE’), which is a secure FTP site the federal government uses for transferring large data files.” Some raised concerns that the request to transmit information over email meant the information could be vulnerable to hacking. But in this week’s filing, Kobach said he only intended for states to submit the eight narrative responses by email. EPIC noted that Kobach offered no explanation for the discrepancy, and said that even the file exchange program Kobach wants to use doesn’t present enough protections for voters’ data.“The Commission has not provided any evidence that the File Exchange system is designed, or even permitted, to be used to transfer sensitive personal information,” EPIC lawyers wrote in their filing. “The Commission also has not established that it has the authority to use the File Exchange system for this purpose, or that it has the authority to use ‘the White House computer system’ to store the personal data of hundreds of millions of voters.”The prospect of storing information on White House computers is also notable because the original executive order said the committee would be supported by the General Services Administration. If GSA held the data, Gellman said, it would be subject to additional privacy requirements. McGeveran said the commission’s cavalier attitude toward storing sensitive voter information is alarming. “Of course we know the federal government has been hacked for personal information multiple times,” he said. “The fact they are being so flippant about how it’s going to be transmitted and where it’s going to be stored and [changing] their story... I have concerns about this plan not being carefully thought out and presented in advance.”"

When Williams asked Headey what it was like welcoming her son when filming for “Game of Thrones” began, Headey said it was “really horrendous” and explained she had postnatal depression.“I saw a doctor for the medical check, and I just burst into tears,” she said. “She said I was postnatally depressed and I went, ‘Am I? Why is that?’ I saw a great guy and he sorted me out, but I did the first year [on ′Game of Thrones’] in that space, figuring out motherhood and going through a weird time personally. It was tricky.”In 2014, Headey briefly mentioned her experience with postpartum depression in an interview with The Telegraph. She explained that she was unaware she had the disorder for “a long time.”“I went a bit nuts and eventually went to a guy who mixes Western and Eastern philosophy in terms of medicine and he put me on a course of something that changed everything,” she said.While speaking with Williams for The Edit, Headey, who has a son and a daughter, also stressed that she and her character are “very different” and offered an important list of things she wants for her children.“What I want for my children is for them to be kind and conscious and happy and that’s it, really,” she said. “I don’t want them to think, ‘You have to achieve that in order to have that,’ because that’s not true anymore. And I want my daughter to have a good voice and to use it, to not feel restricted by being a woman in any way, to make her choices freely.”"

That is, unless giant waterslides are involved.Officers Carrie Lee and Joe Jones of Asheville, North Carolina, took a ride down a homemade slip-and-slide on Sunday after responding to complaints that the slide was blocking the road, according to the Charlotte Observer. The officers reported to the block party to assess the danger, but once they determined there was no problem, they decided to join in on the fun.“The first thing I said [was], ‘I’m not here to come break up your fun,’” Lee said she told partygoers, according to a video tweeted by the Asheville Police Department.That’s when Lee made the call to ride down the slide, which was built on a hill in the neighborhood. According to the officers, Lee put on a trash bag and scooted herself down the water slide.“When the female officer asked for a garbage bag, we almost didn’t believe it. But she took off her radio and went for it!” Katlen Joyce Smith, a resident who was at the party, told ABC News. “They told us to have a great day, posed for some pictures and thanked us for the fun!”Knowing he couldn’t fit in a trash bag as easily as Lee could, Jones thought their mission was complete. Then the neighborhood kids brought out a large inflatable raft.“I’m too big to fit in a trash bag so I was like, ‘I’m getting out of it,’” Jones explained. “But then the kids pulled out this big raft, and so I had no choice.”Jones took his place in the raft along with a neighborhood kid and, with more weight, the two slid easily down the hill and landed in a small pool.Jones’ splash landing ended up being the most memorable one of the Independence Day weekend.“He was the only one that made it all the way from the top to the bottom,” Travis Eagledove, the resident who filmed the video, told ABC News. “It was the best slide from the three days of it being there.”Ashville Police shared the moment on Facebook on Monday with advice for other law enforcement officers.The department wrote on Monday: “When it’s hot...and your [sic] responding to a street complaint...and there’s a fun way to cool down...you take advantage of a giant slip and slide.” "

The entire incident, which occurred on June 28, was caught on security footage.Rhonda Sapp, president of the Mint workers’ union, confirmed to the Times that she was inundated with calls from horrified employees. The perpetrator was placed on administrative leave.U.S. Mint officials released a statement on the incident, according to CBS Philadelphia:We have absolutely zero tolerance for the kind of misconduct reported at the Mint. [Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin] has directed that this matter be handled swiftly and seriously. The investigation is moving ahead quickly. We strive every day for a workplace environment that is welcoming and safe for all.Nooses, a common and blatant symbol of hate used to intimidate African Americans, have been found in public places across the country this year.In June, a noose was found hanging from a lamppost outside the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. Also in Washington, on May 31, tourists found one lying on the floor inside the National Museum of African American History and Culture, and a week earlier, there was another hanging from a tree at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden.Nooses were also found at a frat house at the University of Maryland, a middle school in Florida, and at two high schools in separate incidents in North Carolina. A Walker, Louisiana, police officer resigned in March after leaving a noose in the department’s squad room.Meanwhile, bananas were found hanging from nooses at American University in D.C. in May, following reports in September of bananas being used to harass students in two other incidents (no nooses were involved).“While this incident targeted AU’s chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority ... and occurred after the first black woman and AKA member was sworn in as the Student Government president—our entire university community has been adversely affected by this cowardly, despicable act,” university President Neil Kerwin said at the time.Though current data on the frequency of these acts is hard to come by, the FBI documented a 6.7 percent increase in reported hate crimes in 2015, and other groups have documented a much more dramatic increase over the course of the last election cycle.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/595fc1cb2100003700fc5d21.jpeg?cache=Zm4dAH42oK&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) asked U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions in a letter Friday whether any White House employee or adviser to the president had contacted the Department of Justice regarding the proposed merger of AT&T and Time Warner. Klobuchar’s request follows reports this week that administration officials have considered interfering in the $85 billion merger over President Donald Trump’s frustration with CNN, a Time Warner subsidiary, and the news network’s president, Jeff Zucker. The New York Times reported Wednesday night that White House officials viewed the AT&T-Time Warner deal as “a potential point of leverage” over CNN. The Daily Caller reported Thursday the White House wouldn’t support the deal unless Zucker was let go in the process. And Politico also reported Thursday that chief White House strategist Steve Bannon had “pushed the idea of blocking the merger.”AT&T’s acquisition of Time Warner has been expected to be approved by the Department of Justice, which enforces antitrust violations, and reportedly could be completed within 60 days. Some analysts have voiced skepticism that the the merger could be rejected simply due to the president’s animus toward CNN given that the Department of Justice would be expected to defend its decision on legal grounds. Regardless of whether Trump officials follow through with any plans to disrupt the deal, the notion they’ve discussed punishing companies over critical coverage, or see the proposed deal as leverage in battling a news organization, is alarming.A DOJ spokesperson declined to comment on the letter. Klobuchar, like several of her Democratic Senate colleagues, has expressed concerns that the merger could be bad for consumers and previously urged Sessions to closely scrutinize the companies’ plans. But Klobuchar, who serves as ranking member of the Senate’s antitrust subcommittee, wrote that “any political interference in antitrust enforcement is unacceptable.” “Even more concerning, in this instance, is that it appears that some advisers to the President may believe that it is appropriate for the government to use its law enforcement authority to alter or censor the press,” she wrote. “Such an action would violate the First Amendment.”Read Klobuchar’s letter below:Dear Attorney General Sessions:"

(“I asked Cricket if she knew what F-O-U-R spelled and she confidently said ‘YES! MOANA,’” reads one recent caption.)Despite all her accomplishments, the 38-year-old actress still keeps it real enough that you can’t help but relate to her. Like that time she thought she had a shoulder injury and then realized she might just be just an overloaded parent:Philipps recently found time to speak with us on behalf of Pull-Ups, whom she teamed up with for Potty Training Awareness Month and to encourage moms to to donate their stockpiled diapers to a local diaper bank. Since we knew she’d marched for her two daughters in the L.A. Women’s March last year, we thought she’d be the perfect person to ask about raising strong feminist women. Read on for her thoughts on parenting girls in the age of Trump, mom-shaming and of course, potty-training.So did you have any major potty-training disasters?Cricket had a pretty major accident during her school play last year when we were just in the middle of potty training. She was unphased by it. That’s the thing. And none of the other kids cared because they’re all new to potty-training themselves. I just felt terrible, like I had failed her, you know.And I think that that’s one of the things that parents should be able to take away from it ― that it’s not really about you. We put so much expectation on these little people, but they’re cool man. They’re just living their lives trying to figure it all out. They don’t care, they’re fine. We asked the HuffPost Parents community if they had anything they wanted to ask you and they wanted to know: Have you ever been mom-shamed?Yes I have been for sure. I think everybody has been, right? I make these cakes ― pretty intense cakes. I’m known for that. So I made Birdie a cake for her birthday and they were doing her birthday celebration at her school and I was working at the time and running around and so I went and picked up two dozen cupcakes to bring for the school celebration.And the valet at the place where I was picking up the cupcakes asks me what the cupcakes were for and I told him, “Oh it’s my daughter’s birthday at school.” And he goes, “Oh, you don’t make your kid’s cupcakes for her birthday?”Like seriously? And I turned away and I was just so annoyed. I mean first of all you don’t know my life, dude, and secondly I made a huge cake and third the fact that I felt like I needed to explain it to this guy anyway was such a crazy moment and it made so so mad.  Do you have concerns about raising girls in this political climate? I would be more concerned about raising boys, to be honest with you, and the messages that they’re being sent. You know what I mean? I have really strong ladies and I feel like the messages that they get at home, and also in the community that we live in and the people that we surround ourselves with and our family members all send very similar messages about what’s appropriate. I think that it’s incredibly troubling, but it’s also been an opportunity to open up a lot of different dialogues about a lot of different things that truthfully weren’t even talked about when we were growing up.How do you talk to your kids about those things?We try to start with the basics of treating others the way you want to be treated and kindness and what’s an appropriate way to talk to one another what’s an appropriate way to talk about one another. And certainly some messages are going to permeate the culture and they’re going to get them because they’re living in this world. Our job as parents of young women is to counteract that as much as possible with our own messages of empowerment.How do you handle things like body image?Birdie’s recently gotten into rock climbing, which I love because it really makes her body feel strong. And I try to emphasize in terms of body image that strength is so important and feeling strong and good and healthy is really important. They see me, and I try to live my life as such. I’m not perfect. I’m also an actress. I succumb to a lot of things that I wish I didn’t in terms of body image and the way that I feel about myself. But we do the best we can, all of us. And that’s ultimately what I hope my girls get across. They also have a really awesome dad who gives them a lot of physical attention and tells them how beautiful and smart and how wonderful they are all the time.Sounds like you’re raising a couple of feminists. I know what some of the messages are culturally. Obviously I’m aware of a lot of the messages that are being spread in the media, and by the president of the United States. But I think that we can counteract it. I do. It’s not easy. It’s never gonna be easy for women. It just isn’t.The HuffPost Parents newsletter, So You Want To Raise A Feminist, offers the latest stories and news in progressive parenting. "

Pat Toomey (R-Penn.) and now lobbies on health care issues as vice president of government and legislative affairs for Lehigh Valley Hospital and Health Network. Tirrell’s most recent lobbying report from the first quarter of 2017 shows she advocated for repealing the Affordable Care Act and replacing it with the House of Representatives’ American Health Care Act. Her past lobbying reports show a history of involvement with various health care issues. Previously, Tirrell served as director of community and economic development for Rick Santorum when he was a senator for Pennsylvania.Another revolver also worked for one of the Senate’s “swing votes.” Amanda Makki was a legislative aide to Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) for almost eight years, and eventually became her top health care adviser. Before that she was a health policy adviser to Rep. Jeff Fortenberry (R-Neb.). In 2014, she left her work in Congress to become a lobbyist. Now, she is director of external affairs and FDA for Novo Nordisk, a global diabetes care company.

Although many of these lobbyists have diverse client rosters, with clients from other sectors besides health care, the spike in donations to Republicans in 2016 is striking. While the partisan breakdown of giving during the past few cycles by health care lobbyists who are not revolvers is similar to that for revolvers, the likelihood of giving is much lower. Of the 1,121 health care lobbyists who have not been through the revolving door just 262, or less than a quarter, have given a total of $2.4 million to members of the relevant congressional committees since 2007. By contrast, almost two-thirds of revolvers made contributions to committee members. Another notable difference – prior to 2014 non-revolvers gave considerably more of their money to Democrats, while revolvers gave equally to both major parties, even slightly favoring Republicans.See more data on the health care debate here.Dan Auble provided the data for this story, Sara Swann and Ashley Balcerzak contributed reporting."

As many news reports pointed out, we had proposed a “border of solar panels” in a December op-ed in The WorldPost that had more than one million social interactions. Although we are encouraged that the president has drawn further attention to the colossal potential of solar energy in the U.S.-Mexico border region, we wish to clarify that our vision is fundamentally different from Trump’s — and much more rewarding.Rather than a concrete slab with a coating of solar panels, we propose building a conventional — but vast — series of solar parks along the Mexican side of the border: a “solar border.” Instead of wasting around $70 billion on a wall that would be an ecological nightmare and easily traversed in two minutes with a handmade ladder and a rope, the solar parks we propose would create a different kind of structure between the countries, one funded by private investors that would capitalize on some of the best sunlight territory on the planet. This approach would provide copious benefits. 1. Affordable clean energy could power the cities and industries near the border and also, with the help of low-loss, high-voltage transmission lines, distant areas across North America, with an environmental footprint minuscule by comparison to fossil fuel plants of the same capacity.2. A massive, long-term infrastructure program would provide thousands of jobs, many of them high-skilled, to potential border crossers.3. A physical obstacle equipped with sensors and other security measures would offer an effective way to impede the illegal traffic of drugs, arms and people across the border.4. Solar-powered desalination plants would provide freshwater for desert and agricultural areas that will be ever-more desiccated as the planet warms.5. Enough renewable energy would make an impressive contribution toward reducing global warming, one that could enable both Mexico and the U.S. to significantly exceed their original commitments under the Paris climate change accord.6. Unlike a wall, such a border would be a shining symbol of shared purpose and comity among neighboring nations and a model for other states of the world to emulate.Solar parks, in contrast to walls with solar panels, can produce vast amounts of clean energy with comparatively minimal environmental impact, and they actually do pay for themselves relatively quickly. That’s why, as Mexican Energy Secretary Pedro Joaquin Coldwell said earlier this year, dozens of companies have invested more than $6.5 billion in solar and wind parks in Mexico in the past year, at record-breaking low costs for consumers. These companies and others are expected to bid another $4 billion before November. If Mexico can raise over $10 billion in two years for renewable energy in parts of its territory, it stands to reason it could do the same along its northern border, especially since that energy could be sold either to Mexico or the voracious markets north of the border at lower prices than are currently available. This is because the costs of construction, maintenance and operations in Mexico are far lower than in the U.S. Southwest, and the sunlight is even more intense.Building a strip of solar parks along the Mexican side of the border would be paid for not by taxpayers of either country but, as the Berggruen Institute’s Nicolas Berggruen and the WorldPost’s editor-in-chief, Nathan Gardels, have suggested, by private investors. And since such investors would pay rent to the owners of the land on which the parks would be built, a lot of which does not currently generate revenue, they would mollify fierce local resistance to the current wall proposal and, more importantly, provide training and employment at diverse skill levels for thousands of workers, some of whom might otherwise try to enter the U.S. without permission. Our proposal would also curb the cross-border traffic of drugs, arms and people far more effectively than a 30-foot-high wall. Solar arrays ten rows deep, surrounded by chain-link fences, are not as high or imposing as a wall, but they would constitute a much more formidable obstacle course, one that would be decisively more strenuous and time-consuming to cross over or under than a single concrete wall. Sensors in these sprawling arrays would detect crossers and give authorities much more time to arrive. Vehicles carrying heroin, cocaine and crystal meth in one direction or firearms and ammunition in the other — a major concern for communities like the Tohono O’odham tribe, whose territory spans both sides of the border and is about the size of Connecticut — would be completely cut off from border areas by the solar parks. And any tunnel dug under the solar parks would have to be at least as long as the parks are wide, requiring much more time, money and risk than a tunnel under a wall that’s only a foot or so thick. In other words, to impede unauthorized crossing, we are proposing a series of broad structures, rather than a tall but thin structure. Broad structures are simply better for this purpose.Furthermore, solar arrays have an exemplary track record in the protection of delicate ecosystems ― they use mitigation techniques such as land bridges, tunnels and passing areas for threatened species, including Mexican gray wolves, jaguars and ocelots; these causeways could be carefully monitored by authorities to ensure that wildlife, but not traffickers, can pass through. And in some areas, as ethnobiologist Gary Nabhan has suggested, the solar arrays could be used to provide shade and water collection for heat-sensitive food crops, thus deriving a double economic benefit from the land.In others areas, they could be used to create what scientists have described as a “solar reef,” in which local flora and fauna avail themselves of the shade provided by the solar panels. Along the U.S.-Mexico border, such reefs could protect ecosystem vitality in habitats increasingly jeopardized by climate change. An additional benefit, one that Saudi Arabia and others have pioneered, is solar-powered desalination plants that could be placed on the coasts of the Pacific Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico and the northern Gulf of California. Via pipelines, these facilities would provide fresh water for people, agriculture and wildlife preservation, thus alleviating the worst ravages of climate change that have been forecast for the border region in the decades to come.We have been asked why Mexico would ever want to build such a structure, since it is said that the Mexican government is eager for its people to sneak into the U.S. so they can send home remittances and is secretly delighted with the large quantities of drug money that enter Mexico from the north. But this is a distorted stereotype. The reality of modern Mexico is that government leaders from all political parties sincerely lament that thousands of vulnerable Mexicans, many of them from indigenous communities, have died horrific deaths in their attempts to cross the border.Mexico’s leaders would prefer that their 130 million citizens build good lives at home, where they have access to universal health care, tuition-free public universities and a growing economy. Furthermore, Mexico’s foremost political and humanitarian crisis is the brutal drug war, which has claimed 175,000 lives in a decade. Mexican leaders are aware that reducing the porosity of the border would greatly diminish the appeal of Mexico as a corridor for drugs from South America and Asia and would also make it harder for cartels to smuggle weapons from the U.S. into Mexico, where almost all guns are illegal for civilians.Moreover, Mexico’s leaders have shown a strong commitment to reducing global warming, pledging 35 percent clean energy generation by 2024. They know that whoever builds the most powerful solar array on the planet, one servicing two economies that together represent 16 percent of the world’s carbon emissions, would be feted as a hero in the epic battle against climate change and, not incidentally, benefit from an investment that solar experts Vasilis Fthenakis and Ken Zweibel argue would not only be “technically and economically feasible” but also, potentially, “wildly profitable.”The question we ask, therefore, is why wouldn’t Mexico want to invite private investors to build the solar border? For that matter, why wouldn’t the U.S. want to let them build it on the northern side? If either nation were to adopt our proposal, many of the worst problems afflicting the bilateral relationship would be ameliorated, thousands of good jobs would be created, an immense return on investment would be guaranteed and an unprecedented abundance of cheap, clean energy would be generated.In fact, if both the U.S. and Mexico were to adopt this plan in collaboration, it would be nothing less than the deal of the millennium. Mexico doesn’t need a new wall ― it needs a New Deal. Instead of a wall symbolizing enmity, the solar border would be a lasting monument to hope, friendship and the entrepreneurial spirit, a glittering strand that could be seen by an astronaut standing on the moon, and one that could help save our little blue planet."

Affordable clean energy could power the cities and industries near the border and also, with the help of low-loss, high-voltage transmission lines, distant areas across North America, with an environmental footprint minuscule by comparison to fossil fuel plants of the same capacity.2. A massive, long-term infrastructure program would provide thousands of jobs, many of them high-skilled, to potential border crossers.3. A physical obstacle equipped with sensors and other security measures would offer an effective way to impede the illegal traffic of drugs, arms and people across the border.4. Solar-powered desalination plants would provide freshwater for desert and agricultural areas that will be ever-more desiccated as the planet warms.5. Enough renewable energy would make an impressive contribution toward reducing global warming, one that could enable both Mexico and the U.S. to significantly exceed their original commitments under the Paris climate change accord.6. Unlike a wall, such a border would be a shining symbol of shared purpose and comity among neighboring nations and a model for other states of the world to emulate.Solar parks, in contrast to walls with solar panels, can produce vast amounts of clean energy with comparatively minimal environmental impact, and they actually do pay for themselves relatively quickly. That’s why, as Mexican Energy Secretary Pedro Joaquin Coldwell said earlier this year, dozens of companies have invested more than $6.5 billion in solar and wind parks in Mexico in the past year, at record-breaking low costs for consumers. These companies and others are expected to bid another $4 billion before November. If Mexico can raise over $10 billion in two years for renewable energy in parts of its territory, it stands to reason it could do the same along its northern border, especially since that energy could be sold either to Mexico or the voracious markets north of the border at lower prices than are currently available. This is because the costs of construction, maintenance and operations in Mexico are far lower than in the U.S. Southwest, and the sunlight is even more intense.Building a strip of solar parks along the Mexican side of the border would be paid for not by taxpayers of either country but, as the Berggruen Institute’s Nicolas Berggruen and the WorldPost’s editor-in-chief, Nathan Gardels, have suggested, by private investors. And since such investors would pay rent to the owners of the land on which the parks would be built, a lot of which does not currently generate revenue, they would mollify fierce local resistance to the current wall proposal and, more importantly, provide training and employment at diverse skill levels for thousands of workers, some of whom might otherwise try to enter the U.S. without permission. Our proposal would also curb the cross-border traffic of drugs, arms and people far more effectively than a 30-foot-high wall. Solar arrays ten rows deep, surrounded by chain-link fences, are not as high or imposing as a wall, but they would constitute a much more formidable obstacle course, one that would be decisively more strenuous and time-consuming to cross over or under than a single concrete wall. Sensors in these sprawling arrays would detect crossers and give authorities much more time to arrive. Vehicles carrying heroin, cocaine and crystal meth in one direction or firearms and ammunition in the other — a major concern for communities like the Tohono O’odham tribe, whose territory spans both sides of the border and is about the size of Connecticut — would be completely cut off from border areas by the solar parks. And any tunnel dug under the solar parks would have to be at least as long as the parks are wide, requiring much more time, money and risk than a tunnel under a wall that’s only a foot or so thick. In other words, to impede unauthorized crossing, we are proposing a series of broad structures, rather than a tall but thin structure. Broad structures are simply better for this purpose.Furthermore, solar arrays have an exemplary track record in the protection of delicate ecosystems ― they use mitigation techniques such as land bridges, tunnels and passing areas for threatened species, including Mexican gray wolves, jaguars and ocelots; these causeways could be carefully monitored by authorities to ensure that wildlife, but not traffickers, can pass through. And in some areas, as ethnobiologist Gary Nabhan has suggested, the solar arrays could be used to provide shade and water collection for heat-sensitive food crops, thus deriving a double economic benefit from the land.In others areas, they could be used to create what scientists have described as a “solar reef,” in which local flora and fauna avail themselves of the shade provided by the solar panels. Along the U.S.-Mexico border, such reefs could protect ecosystem vitality in habitats increasingly jeopardized by climate change. An additional benefit, one that Saudi Arabia and others have pioneered, is solar-powered desalination plants that could be placed on the coasts of the Pacific Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico and the northern Gulf of California. Via pipelines, these facilities would provide fresh water for people, agriculture and wildlife preservation, thus alleviating the worst ravages of climate change that have been forecast for the border region in the decades to come.We have been asked why Mexico would ever want to build such a structure, since it is said that the Mexican government is eager for its people to sneak into the U.S. so they can send home remittances and is secretly delighted with the large quantities of drug money that enter Mexico from the north. But this is a distorted stereotype. The reality of modern Mexico is that government leaders from all political parties sincerely lament that thousands of vulnerable Mexicans, many of them from indigenous communities, have died horrific deaths in their attempts to cross the border.Mexico’s leaders would prefer that their 130 million citizens build good lives at home, where they have access to universal health care, tuition-free public universities and a growing economy. Furthermore, Mexico’s foremost political and humanitarian crisis is the brutal drug war, which has claimed 175,000 lives in a decade. Mexican leaders are aware that reducing the porosity of the border would greatly diminish the appeal of Mexico as a corridor for drugs from South America and Asia and would also make it harder for cartels to smuggle weapons from the U.S. into Mexico, where almost all guns are illegal for civilians.Moreover, Mexico’s leaders have shown a strong commitment to reducing global warming, pledging 35 percent clean energy generation by 2024. They know that whoever builds the most powerful solar array on the planet, one servicing two economies that together represent 16 percent of the world’s carbon emissions, would be feted as a hero in the epic battle against climate change and, not incidentally, benefit from an investment that solar experts Vasilis Fthenakis and Ken Zweibel argue would not only be “technically and economically feasible” but also, potentially, “wildly profitable.”The question we ask, therefore, is why wouldn’t Mexico want to invite private investors to build the solar border? For that matter, why wouldn’t the U.S. want to let them build it on the northern side? If either nation were to adopt our proposal, many of the worst problems afflicting the bilateral relationship would be ameliorated, thousands of good jobs would be created, an immense return on investment would be guaranteed and an unprecedented abundance of cheap, clean energy would be generated.In fact, if both the U.S. and Mexico were to adopt this plan in collaboration, it would be nothing less than the deal of the millennium. Mexico doesn’t need a new wall ― it needs a New Deal. Instead of a wall symbolizing enmity, the solar border would be a lasting monument to hope, friendship and the entrepreneurial spirit, a glittering strand that could be seen by an astronaut standing on the moon, and one that could help save our little blue planet."

You never really hear anyone say, “I need my life to become more hectic!” In these very turbulent times, people",2017-07-07,<p>Angela Buttimer and Dennis Buttimer- TEDx 2017</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/595ff0841800001d006733ba.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It’s funny. You never really hear anyone say, “I need my life to become more hectic!” In these very turbulent times, people are searching for relief from their high levels of stress.In our recent TEDx talk entitled “Defusing Stress With Mindful Mojo,” we discussed four proven strategies to reduce stress effectively.Did you know that stress is the #1 health epidemic in the United States? And the World Health Organization (WHO) informs us that by the year 2020, stress, anxiety and depression will be the #1 disability in the world! This epidemic is costing American businesses $330 billion a year. 75% of employees report that stress is adversely affecting both their professional and personal lives.But it doesn’t have to be that way. Mindfulness or what we call mindful mojo really can make a difference. Think of it as calm but dynamic energy. By practicing mindfulness, you transform your stress so that you have more calm, clarity, energy and creativity.When you get overwhelmed with stress, the fear center in the brain, the amygdala, hijacks the rational part of the brain. The hippocampus, associated with learning and memory, is also greatly affected. What we’ve observed as coaches and trainers is that you end up not being able to think straight. You can’t remember and you tend to make bad decisions.During our recent TEDx Talk, we share four hacks to overcome stress:Practice deep belly breathing. Try this now: breathe in through your nose into your belly filling it up like a balloon. On the out-breath, exhale through the nose or the mouth as your belly flattens toward the spine. Do that very slowly three times. Feel a difference? This simple technique alone can lower you stress level because it engages the parasympathetic nervous system eliciting the relaxation response. It’s helpful whether you’re in traffic, a board meeting, or a doctor’s office.Relax the body. Probably sounds too easy, right? Try this: With both feet grounded on the floor, systematically relax the body. Slowly scan the body from head to toe, relaxing each part as you proceed : the face, neck and shoulders, chest and belly, arms and hands, hips and pelvis, legs and feet. By gently placing your focus on each part of the body, you cause it to shift from a held tension state into a more relaxed condition. When you are relaxed in your body, you are more effective in everything you do.Unplug from technology. This is a difficult one as we all love our technology! But you can become easily overwhelmed and overstimulated with communication and information. This results in wasted time and poor decisions. By taking brief breaks, you’ll find that you return feeling calmer and clearer, with more energy and creativity. Make a pact with yourself to initiate break times throughout the day away from all technology. Just making this adjustment will go a long way in lowering your stress levels!Work with your thoughts. Scientists tells us that we think about 60,000- 70,000 thoughts a day and most are repetitive! You can “drive yourself crazy” with all the chatter in your head. In our work, we have found that most people have a critical, judgmental voice in their heads. It might sound like “I’m such an idiot,” or “I don’t have what it takes,” or “I’m too overwhelmed.” Ever have a voice like that? We can relate to it. As a teenager, Angela struggled with depression and Dennis with anxiety. As teenagers, we learned to meditate, and it has served us well ever since. What we learned then and now teach is that you are not your thoughts. They are just thoughts. Think of them as clouds floating by. Lean back and witness them without fusing with them. Don’t let your thoughts think you. Take charge. This is where your authentic power resides.Implementing these four strategies on a daily basis really can make a difference. From a place of self-honor, self-respect and self-care, utilize these exercises to transform your stress states into peace, happiness and well-being.Can we help you or your organization defuse stress and access mindful mojo?

Growing up, I spent so much time in church, I was oblivious to what being a ho even meant. My other classmates laughed, and someone even played that Ludacris song, and I laughed along with them. After school, I went home and researched what it meant. I was devastated – how could I be a ho? I didn’t even share my first kiss until I was 16. As I continued to grow older and into my body and self, it was a term that I heard often, along with “bitch,” “slut,” “whore” among other offenses from both men AND women. There would be times when I would reject a pass or invitation from a guy, and I would be met with these terms and aggression. There were times when “mean girls” would make rumors up about me, and I was left defending myself and dispelling those rumors. Becoming LiberatedI have always believed that a woman has the right to choose what to do with her body and how she uses her body. My sophomore year in college, I had a conversation with one of my best friends about what it meant to become liberated as a woman. As a survivor of sexual assault, it was even more important for me to reclaim and take full control of my body: physically, mentally and spiritually.I didn't feel comfortable having multiple relationships at once, but still wanted to walk with authority and with an understanding that my body is mine, and that only I could define me. I journeyed towards making this a reality, and was met with a lot of backlash. Becoming liberated is a state of mind that is unfortunately met with a society that is not ready for it. In a country that is moving away from being religious, there is still a conservative worldview that exists on what's appropriate in society. Whether it's running for Congress as a former stripper or posting pictures on Snapchat, seeking liberation means being intentional about who you are, being aware that people will talk about you, and understanding that what they say does not make you who you are.I learned lessons from people like:Blac Chyna and Amber Rose who exhibited this during the VMAs when they chose to wear outfits with words people had used to describe them to raise awareness about slutshaming and decided to host Slutwalks in Los Angeles.Revisiting Double StandardsI remember having a conversation about the double standards that exists in society. There’s a song by Christina Aguilera featuring Lil Kim called Can’t Hold Us Down (this song was my introduction to feminism before I knew what feminism was). In the song, Lil Kim rapsHere’s something I just can’t understand/ If the guy have three girls then he’s the man/ He can either give us some head, sex a roar/ If the girl do the same, then she’s a whoreI have always felt at odds knowing I lived in a society that subconsciously (and consciously) discriminates against women, especially women of color. We know about the way society approves guys sexual behaviors and dismisses the ones of women. Guys are often met with dabs, high fives and fist bumps of excitement from their bros, and many women are met with eye rolls, whispers and stares. The same can be said about equal pay for women, and job growth opportunities in the workplace for women. Women statistically have more degrees than men, but the wage gap between men and women is so wide, the AAWU believes it won’t close until 2152.Moving Beyond the Names and Loving YouIt took some time, but once I became confident and comfortable with who I was, I saw the world a lot differently. Life is too short to be worried about the lady in Fashion Nova jeans and cropped tops or who is taking the “walk of shame” in the morning. I began to focus on ways to become more productive in addressing these issues.In college, I sat on the committee as a representative of Dillard University and keynoted the Take Back the Night event in New Orleans to raise awareness about sexual assault, rape and shaming of women. In graduate school at Yale, I coordinated the Its On Us event for graduate students learn more about ways to support those who have been assaulted.Most recently, I co-founded Jobs R 4 U, a nonprofit organization that works to ensure economic equity and empowerment for all, especially women, youth and people of color. I truly do believe that people can succeed when given the right resources to become gainfully employed, despite who they are and where they come from.Although it took some time for me to move past being called a ho and seeking liberation, I did it. My mother told me that, ""People will always have something to say about you, but what matters most is how you feel about yourself."" Those words guided me through college and beyond. I was proud of who I had become: the mistakes, heartbreaks, and negative energy, in addition to the love, affirmations and opportunities pushed me forward.I wrote this letter to you, because I remember what it was like.

But his followers maintain that the guru is in a state of deep meditation, called “samadhi,” and will eventually return to life.Disciples at Maharaj’s well-guarded, 100-acre ashram in northern India have kept the guru’s body in a commercial freezer since 2014.“He is not dead,” the guru’s spokesman Swami Vishalanand told the BBC shortly after his death. “Medical science does not understand things like yogic science. We will wait and watch. We are confident that he will come back.”State officials who were permitted entry to where the guru’s body is being kept described the body as dark and shrunken, “like an Egyptian mummy,” The Independent reported in 2014.Once news of the guru’s death became public, a man claiming to be Maharaj’s son came forward with a petition to cremate his alleged father’s body in line with Hindu rituals. The guru’s followers assert Maharaj didn’t have a family, according to The Tribune. But Dalip Jha, his alleged son, has offered to do a DNA test to prove his identity.A man named Puran Singh, who claims to be a former driver for the guru, filed a petition shortly after Maharaj’s seeking a post-mortem examination. Singh has accused followers of holding onto the guru’s body in an attempt to maintain control of his wealth.Maharaj’s sect, reportedly established in Jalandhar, Punjab, in 1983, has attracted millions of followers and amassed a wealth of roughly $120,000,000, according to the BBC.On Thursday, the Punjab and Haryana High Court ruled in favor of the guru’s followers, citing religious freedom in their decision to allow disciples to keep his body in a freezer indefinitely.The court also argued that there are no laws requiring disposal of a body after death.“We thus, find ourselves in a piquant situation where in the absence of any law or obligation flowing therefrom, to give any directions to dispose of the body even if one were to venture considering to do so,” stated the 40-page ruling, according to CNN."

In a Thursday interview with Grindr’s new online publication, Into, the 43-year-old musician opened up about her identity for the first time. “This is my fifth decade being alive,” she explained, “and in each of those decades, there’s been a time where I’ve tried to say, ‘Hey, I think I’m transgender!’ This was even before that word existed.” For now, she’ll continue to go by “Gavin,” but said that may change in the future. Russom joined LCD Soundsystem shortly before the band recorded 2010′s “This Is Happening,” which was then intended to be its final album. Since then, she’s stayed active in music with a handful of solo projects as well as collaborations with Delia Gonzalez and The Crystal Ark. She’s slated to make her public debut as a trans woman July 13, when she’ll DJ at the Femme’s Room party at Chicago’s Berlin nightclub. Russom’s decision to come out just months before LCD Soundsystem returns with a new album, “American Dream,” was a deliberate one. As a public figure in the mainstream music scene, she’ll embrace being a role model to young people who may be struggling with coming to terms with the gender identity. “For anybody who is struggling with their gender identity or who wants to come out and is afraid to, what would be better than giving someone permission to do that through my performance? That’s the ultimate,” she explained to Into’s Nico Lang. “It’s what other people gave to me, so I’d love to pass that along to other people, too.”Russom said she’s well aware of the challenges she’ll face as a newly-out transgender woman at a time when many members of the LGBTQ community feel uncertain about their future under President Donald Trump. “For people of transgender experience, walking out of the house in a way they feel comfortable is a revolutionary act. It’s resistance,” she said. The ongoing debate whether or not trans people should be legally permitted to use public bathrooms that best correspond with their gender identity, she said, is a very specific concern. “I’m the happiest I’ve ever been, but I have my good days and my bad days,” she said. “On my bad days, it really sucks and I wait until I get home to go to the bathroom—which is such a basic thing.”Read Into’s full interview with Gavin Russom here.

Just 46 percent have a similar level of confidence in Trump.Merkel also received significantly higher ratings than Trump in a dozen other countries, while Trump fared substantially better in only two of the countries surveyed, India and Russia.Trump and Merkel, who met in a tense encounter in March, held an awkward reunion Thursday in advance of the upcoming G-20 summit in Hamburg, Germany on Friday. The two have sparred openly: Trump previously described Merkel’s refugee policy as a “catastrophic mistake,” while Merkel criticized Trump’s travel ban and trade policies. The German leader also disparaged Trump’s decision to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement on reducing carbon emissions, calling the agreement “irreversible and non-negotiable.”Two-thirds of Americans disapprove of the idea of withdrawing from the agreement according to Pew’s survey, which was taken before Trump’s decision on the Paris accord was made.

Fearing that the state’s elections could be put under federal oversight, lawmakers made small changes to the law in June: They extended the expiration date for some acceptable forms of ID and said voters could confirm their identity with certain documents if they would also sign a sworn affidavit stating they had a “reasonable impediment” blocking them from getting a photo ID.Plaintiffs in the ongoing lawsuit say the new legislation, SB 5, does not go far enough to eliminate discrimination. But the Department of Justice ― which sided with the plaintiffs in the case under the Obama administration and switched positions to side with Texas in February ― said the changes were adequate and that SB 5 “eradicates any discriminatory effect or intent.”Gerry Hebert, a former DOJ lawyer who is among those representing the plaintiffs in the case, accused the department of siding with “racists.”A big issue in the 2011 Texas measure was that it required voters to have identification that black and Hispanic voters were much less likely to have. Critics of the measure pointed to the fact that people could vote if they had a concealed handgun license but not a student ID card. About 600,000 of the state’s 15 million voters lacked an acceptable form of ID, according to ProPublica.Amid ongoing litigation, Texas reached an agreement with the DOJ last year to soften its voter ID law with changes similar to those that were made permanent in the legislation passed in June. Despite those changes, however, there was still significant confusion among voters and poll workers during the 2016 election. The Texas Civil Rights Project logged over 4,000 election incidents reported to a hotline or to volunteers, 8 percent of which dealt with confusion over voter ID requirements.DOJ lawyers said in their filing that they were convinced of Texas’ commitment to educate voters partly because it had allocated $4 million to the effort over two years ― an increase from the $2.5 million allotted under the 2011 law. But that $4 million figure is misleading because it will be spread out over a longer period of time, noted ProPublica’s Jessica Huseman, who has written about Texas’ failure to educate voters about the law.Lawyers for the plaintiffs wrote in their filing that SB 5 failed to address the underlying discrimination in SB 14, and they asked the court to block its photo ID requirements. The plaintiffs argued SB 5 actually “escalates” the discrimination in the original law because the new legislation imposes a prison sentence of up to two years for someone who makes a false statement on an affidavit and doesn’t have acceptable ID.“SB 5 fails to eliminate either SB 14′s racially discriminatory origins or results and, therefore, SB 5 must fall with SB 14. Not only does SB 5 fail to repeal SB 14 in its entirety, but also it fails specifically to remove or meaningfully modify any of the offending voter provisions of SB 14, which this court must enjoin,” lawyers for the plaintiffs wrote.

Perry echoed those concerns, and said one of the only attractive options left, although difficult, is what he called “coercive diplomacy.”“Our diplomacy needs to be coercive, but we need other elements to coerce with. And I think that’s why it’s so important to have China,” Perry told NPR’s Robert Siegel. “We can’t simply point to China and say, ‘China, you solve this problem.’ But they need to be solved jointly with China. They provide the coercion element.”As secretary of defense, Perry worked with Clinton to oversee American policy toward North Korea and helped craft coercive diplomacy to temporarily halt the country’s nuclear development. In 1994, the U.S. threatened a military strike against a North Korean nuclear reactor to stop the production of plutonium. Perry wrote in an April article for Politico: “We were serious, and the North Koreans knew we were ― an exercise of coercive diplomacy that yielded an agreement, imperfectly implemented, that did effectively halt the regime’s nuclear progress for a time.”Such strategies, Perry says, are no longer credible now that North Korea has an array of nuclear weapons and non-nuclear artillery aimed at Seoul, and an ICBM that may be capable of reaching Alaska.Now, he says, the U.S. needs to forge a successful partnership with China rather than focus on ineffective sanctions. “The kind of sanctions we can impose ― I would not say they’re pinpricks, but they do not compare in any way with the intensity of the actions that China could take,” Perry told NPR. “They are the primary trading partner of North Korea. They provide their food and their fuel. This missile program could not have proceeded this far without cooperation from China. So we have to have China’s cooperation.” However, President Donald Trump has grown increasingly agitated with China, and prospects for such a plan are tenuous. The White House has been pressuring Beijing to increase sanctions on North Korea, a prime trading partner. Shortly after the ICBM launch on Tuesday, Trump called on China to “put a heavy move on North Korea and end this nonsense once and for all.”But China has failed to appease the U.S. president, and Trump has warned that he may pressure North Korea on his own.Perry declined to comment on Trump’s ability to handle the situation, but said his hopes for a diplomatic strategy to form are quickly waning.“To be honest with you, I’m not hopeful. I’m not optimistic that we will be able to do this,” Perry told NPR. “I think it can be done. I think we can describe a path to success. But that path is a difficult one, and I am not at all confident that we will take it.” Listen to the full interview on NPR here."

Since the fall of communism in 1989, every U.S. president and vice president visiting Warsaw has stopped at this memorial, according to the New York Times. On Thursday, Trump delivered a speech at Krasinski Square, the site of a monument symbolizing the resistance led by the general Polish population in 1944. The Jewish memorial is located about one mile away, close to a museum dedicated to the history of Polish Jews. Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter and advisor, visited the Warsaw Ghetto Heroes Monument in her father’s place. The first daughter, who is Jewish, laid a wreath and recited a prayer, called the Kaddish, before visiting the museum. In a statement given to White House reporters, Ivanka described the visit as “a deeply moving experience.”Poland’s chief rabbi Michael Schudrich accompanied Ivanka during her visit. Schudrich told the AFP that Ivanka’s visit was “very, very important… not only because she’s a Jew, because her grandparents-in-law are survivors of the Holocaust, but also as a human being it’s important.”“But it’s sad because her father President Trump is the first US president in 25 years not to visit the Warsaw Ghetto Heroes Monument,” he said.A spokesperson for the POLIN Jewish museum told the AFP that museum officials heard about Ivanka’s visit on short notice. On Wednesday, one day before Trump’s visit to Krasinski Square, Jewish leading figures in Poland’s Jewish community expressed their disapproval after finding out the president had no plans to visit the Warsaw Ghetto Heroes Monument. Schudrich, along with Anna Chipczynska, Jewish Community of Warsaw president, and Leslaw Piszewski, president of the Union of Jewish Communities of Poland said in a joint statement that past presidential visits to the Jewish memorial were very important to Poland’s Jewish community.  “For the Jews of Poland, rebuilding in a democratic Poland their communal life, after the horror of the Shoah and the devastation of Communism, this gesture meant recognition, solidarity and hope. We deeply regret that President Donald Trump, though speaking in public barely a mile away from the Monument, chose to break with that laudable tradition. We trust that this slight does not reflect the attitudes and feelings of the American people.”"

If all $400,000 of the president’s annual salary were set aside for Interior, it’d take about 3,750 years of checks to make up for that shortfall.​“As both the Secretary of the Interior and a military veteran, I’m deeply honored and humbled to deliver the donation to Antietam National Battlefield on behalf of President Trump,” Zinke said in a statement announcing the donation. “Visiting the hallowed ground the day after Independence Day is incredibly moving and it underscores the importance of why we must preserve these historic grounds. The President’s donation will allow generations of Americans to learn about our history and heritage on this sacred site.”Zinke also announced grants totaling $7.2 million “to help identify, preserve and protect America’s battlefields” in nine different states. They will be administered through NPS’s American Battlefield Protection Program.Trump’s donation follows through on campaign pledges that he would work for free during his presidency (he said during a meeting in 2015 the promise was “no big deal for me”). But the National Park Service will likely be forced to dramatically scale back its ability to serve the public under the White House’s proposed budget.If passed, the budget would cut 13 percent of funding from the NPS, which would result in 1,200 full-time employees losing their jobs. Outside magazine notes almost all funding for land acquisition would be cut, and the $12 billion backlog needed for park maintenance likely would be pushed off even further.“If enacted, this budget would represent the largest cut to the National Park Service since World War II,” Theresa Pierno, president of the National Parks Conservation Association said in May. “Agencies like the National Park Service and EPA are already operating on shoestring budgets, and this budget, if enacted, will only make a bad situation worse.”In April, Zinke himself noted many of America’s battlefields were among the areas protected by the NPS that had a backlog in maintenance.“We’re about $229 million behind in deferred maintenance on our battlefields alone,” the secretary said.Conservation groups slammed the president’s initial salary donation announcement as a “publicity stunt.”“If Donald Trump is actually interested in helping our parks, he should stop trying to slash their budgets to historically low levels,” the Sierra Club said in April. “This publicity stunt is a sad consolation prize as Trump tries to stifle America’s best idea.”CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article and headline said Trump’s proposed budget would cut $1.5 billion from the National Park Service. It would slash that amount from the Interior Department overall and $296 million from the National Park Service."

His sentencing has remained in limbo amid ongoing allegations that county prosecutors and sheriff’s deputies improperly used a jail informant in his case.Superior Court Judge Thomas Goethals, who has presided over the Dekraai proceedings, has said he is holding the hearings in order to decide if the sheriff’s department can be trusted to hand over evidence to the court. He’s also deciding whether he will throw out the death penalty against Dekraai, and instead sentence him to life in prison without the possibility of parole.Hutchens, who has long denied the existence of a jailhouse informant program, said that if some of her deputies did improperly use jail informants, it was limited to a small number of them. She also testified that neither she nor any sheriff’s department commanders were aware of her deputies working informants in the jail.“There may have been a few deputies who took their duties to different levels than were authorized,” Hutchens said. Her assessment of the situation is similar to that of a recent ― and controversial ― Orange County Grand Jury report that concluded there was no jailhouse informant program and that only a few “rogue” deputies were at fault for using jail informants outside the understanding of their managers.This determination stands in contrast to Goethals’ own findings, which were backed by the state’s 4th District Court of Appeals and said that the “magnitude of the systemic problems cannot be overlooked.”It also contradicts damning evidence unearthed by assistant public defender Scott Sanders, Dekraai’s attorney. Sanders presented Hutchens with multiple internal sheriff’s department memos that detail her deputies using jailhouse informants for more than a decade. The memos, which were all sent to or from management-level OCSD officials, identify “cultivating” and “handing” informants in the jail as key duties of sheriff’s deputies and indicate that sheriff’s deputies had been rewarded for cultivating and managing jail informants.Hutchens said she had not read or been informed of the memos prior to her testimony. She also testified that she hadn’t read either the primary motion in the Dekraai case or the supporting documents filed with it. Moreover, she testified that she never read the transcripts of her deputies’ earlier testimony on the matter ― which Goethals said showed deputies had “either intentionally lied or willfully withheld information” ― even though she publicly vouched for their truthfulness in both 2014 and 2015.Hutchens testified on Wednesday that the scandal largely comes down to a misunderstanding of the legal definition of what a confidential informant actually is.Goethals questioned Hutchens about the sheriff’s department’s continued failure to disclose all records related to the informant issue ― even now, more than four years after he issued his first order that it do so. Goethals has repeatedly lambasted Hutchens for indicating that all pertinent documents have been turned over, only to additional documentation “wash ashore” into his courtroom later.Hutchens responded that she’s aware of the “embarrassing” criticism, adding that the agency has changed some policies pertaining to training deputies in how to use informants and disclosing evidence gleaned from them. Goethals acknowledged the importance of those changes, but said, “The fact that the barn door has closed on this after the horse has left the barn doesn’t help me so much.”Sanders then confronted Hutchens about a letter she sent to staff following the release of the grand jury report. Sanders, who obtained the letter through an unnamed source within the sheriff’s department, emphasized that Hutchens used a very different tone in the letter than she did during her courtroom testimony. In the letter, Hutchens blasted the allegations against the department, the critical statements of “public officials” and the fact that the Dekraai litigation was continuing to probe informant issues. Although she initially said she couldn’t remember which “public officials” she was referring to, she said later that she had been talking about legal scholars who called for a U.S. Department of Justice probe into the informant allegations. The Justice Department announced an investigation into official use of jail informants in the county last year."

And appearance matters as much as reality. So even aside from whether or not that’s actually happening, we need to send a message to the world that the United States is gonna have the gold standard for an ethics program in government, which is what we’ve always had.”Shaub added that it “almost doesn’t matter” if the Trump family is or isn’t making financial gains. “America should have the right to know what the motivations of its leaders are, and they need to know that financial interests, personal financial interests, aren’t among them,” he said.The clip below, which aired Thursday evening, is part of a longer interview with Shaub. CBS News will run another portion on Friday morning. Shaub is planning to join the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit that works on voting rights and campaign finance issues.His resignation, effective July 19, marks the culmination of a months-long battle between the federal government’s top ethics official and Trump, who once promised to “drain the swamp” of corruption in Washington.In his resignation statement, Shaub appeared to be sending a message to the White House. He quoted federal law, praising ethics officials for their commitment to protecting “the principle that public service is a public trust, requiring employees to place loyalty to the Constitution, the laws, and ethical principles above private gain.” Shaub said he was not pressured to resign, according to The New York Times.The White House said it “accepts Mr. Shaub’s resignation and appreciates his service.” The statement added that “the President will be nominating a successor in short order.”The Office of Government Ethics, which was created in the wake of the Watergate scandal, typically works closely with presidential administrations to resolve possible conflicts of interest. But Shaub, who joined the ethics office as an attorney during the George W. Bush administration and was appointed director by Barack Obama, struggled to connect with the Trump transition team after the election. At one point, he resorted to sending out a series of desperate-sounding tweets to get Trump’s attention.Trump announced in January that he would give control of his business empire to his adult sons, becoming the first president in the modern era to refuse to divest or separate himself from holdings with potential conflicts. Shaub sharply criticized the plan for failing to meet the standard that “every president of the past four decades has met.”In his CBS News interview, Shaub also addressed the claim by Trump lawyer Sheri Dillon at a January press conference that if Trump sold off his assets, that “would greatly diminish the value of the assets and create a fire sale.” “I have no sympathy for that,” Shaub told CBS. “He’s in a position where he’s going to have to send young men and women to die in combat, potentially, or risk their lives at least. They’re paying a much higher price. So no, it’s not too much to ask for somebody to incur a bit of a financial loss if they have to sell things off.”Shaub, whose term was set to end in 2018, persisted in trying to do his job under the Trump administration, becoming something of an unlikely bureaucratic hero. When White House counselor Kellyanne Conway urged Fox News viewers to buy products from Ivanka Trump’s fashion line in February — a pitch that appeared to flagrantly violate federal ethics rules — Shaub told the White House that disciplinary action was warranted. (The White House didn’t follow his advice.)Trump also nominated people with enormously complex financial holdings to key Cabinet positions. Reince Priebus, Trump’s chief of staff, tried to publicly blame Shaub’s office for the slow rate at which the White House was filling key positions. But Shaub noted that some of the Trump administration’s nominees pushed back against the government’s ethics requirements with “a ferocity we’ve not previously seen.”Another clash with Shaub’s office came after it directed officials in April to release information about ethics waivers that may have been granted to former lobbyists working in the Trump administration. Instead, the White House questioned the OGE’s legal authority to request the information and sought to stay the inquiry. (The OGE does not conduct investigations or have enforcement power.) This action drew a lengthy response from Shaub, who declined to suspend the ethics inquiry, calling the request “highly unusual.”Shaub said that he didn’t believe there was “much more I could accomplish at the Office of Government Ethics, given the current situation,” according to The New York Times, and that the timing was right for his departure. His new position with the nonprofit group, he reportedly said, will allow him to openly advocate for government ethics reforms. Trump will have the opportunity to appoint a new OGE director and shape the office in his image, a move that is sure to trouble Democrats worried about conflicts of interest in the Trump administration.This article has been updated with more details about Shaub’s resignation and with his remarks to CBS News.Chris D’Angelo contributed to this report."
48,HEALTHY LIVING,Alec Baldwin’s Latest Film Blasted For Treating ‘Disability As A Costume’,Elyse Wanshel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alec-baldwin-blind-disability_us_595e64fce4b0615b9e8fecc2,But the problem is bigger than this film.,2017-07-06,"Actor Alec Baldwin attends the premiere of ""Blind"" in New York City.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/595e676b1800003500673005.jpeg?cache=xXZ2dIUVCC&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Disability advocates note that people with disabilities are often left out of conversations about diversity – and Hollywood is no exception. So it wasn’t a surprise when Alec Baldwin was cast as a blind novelist who loses his wife and his sight during a car crash in the new film, “Blind.”Members of the Ruderman Family Foundation, an advocacy organization that focuses on disability representation, are condemning the film for casting Baldwin, an able-bodied actor, to portray someone who is blind.The group said on its Facebook page that Hollywood is “once again overlooking the opportunity to cast actors with disabilities.”The organization released the Ruderman White Paper on Employment of Actors With Disabilities in Television in 2016 and found that 95 percent of disabled characters on television are played by able-bodied performers.Yet, the issue goes deeper than casting.“Alec Baldwin in ‘Blind’ is just the latest example of treating disability as a costume,” Jay Ruderman, the foundation’s president, said in a statement. “We no longer find it acceptable for white actors to portray black characters. Disability as a costume needs to also become universally unacceptable.”Hollywood could also benefit from the inclusion of people with disabilities, especially since its portrayal of people who are not able-bodied is often problematic.For example, the 2016 movie “Me Before You,” received massive backlash from the disability community due to the film’s romantic lead — a man who becomes quadriplegic after a motorcycle accident — decides to die by suicide because living with a disability is a life that is not worth living. “There is something wrong with this picture,” Marlee Matlin, a deaf Academy Award-winning actress, said during a roundtable discussion about disability inclusion in 2016. “We as an industry keep talking about diversity — we know we have a problem. But, sadly, when we start speaking about diversity, disability seems to be left out far too often.”The male lead, Sam Claflin, in “Me Before You,” like Baldwin, is an able-bodied actor. In other recent examples, so are Eddie Redmayne, who won an Oscar for his role as Stephen Hawking, who has ALS, in “The Theory of Everything” and Jamie Foxx, who is not blind, but portrayed the blind musician, Ray Charles in 2004.“It’s clear that audiences want to see stories about people with disabilities,” Ruderman said in his statement. “And it’s about time we start actually casting the thousands of available, talented actors with disabilities to fill these roles.” "

He is joined by (left to right) Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, Vice President Mike Pence, senior adviser Steve Bannon, press secretary Sean Spicer and then-national security adviser Michael Flynn.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/595ea63d1500006303bfc6ce.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― If President Donald Trump wants to make a good first impression with Russian leader Vladimir Putin when they meet Friday, two words he might consider starting with are “thank” and “you.”Without Putin’s decision to interfere in last year’s presidential campaign on Trump’s behalf, there’s a good possibility he would not have won, given how few votes swung the outcome in the three critical Rust Belt states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.Rick Wilson, a Republican political consultant and frequent Trump critic, said the Russian assistance likely swayed 2-to-3 percentage points in those states that proved crucial to the election’s outcome.“It certainly kept the national Republican base in Trump’s camp,” Wilson said. “Yeah, he should say thank you to Putin. I think this is Donald Trump going to the home office for his quarterly review.”Tim Malloy, an assistant director of polling for Connecticut’s Quinnipiac University, shied away from ascribing a hard number to the Russia effect ― like most in his profession. But he said the impact’s existence was undeniable.“There was a blizzard of negativity thrust at [Democratic nominee] Hillary Clinton. With that intense a blizzard, it follows that some of the snow is going to stick,” he said.Trump himself, many Republicans and even some Democrats dispute that the meddling was determinative, arguing there is no indication that actual votes were altered by Russian-sponsored hackers.“Intelligence stated very strongly there was absolutely no evidence that hacking affected the election results. Voting machines not touched!,” Trump tweeted on Jan. 7, the day after U.S. intelligence agencies stated that Russia had interfered in the campaign, and had done so on Trump’s behalf.Trump’s narrow claim, though, ignores the benefit he received both from hackers as well as an army of pro-Trump bloggers working out of Russia and eastern Europe.The hackers, according to U.S. intelligence agencies, stole emails from the Democratic National Committee and from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, then released politically damaging ones in the campaign’s final weeks. The bloggers wrote and frequently posted false articles about Clinton on Facebook and other social media ― accusing her of corruption, even murder ― in the hopes of flipping her “soft” supporters to Trump or dissuading them from voting at all.Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told reporters in March: “There were upwards of 1,000 paid internet trolls working out of a facility in Russia.”His committee, the House Intelligence Committee and the FBI are all investigating Russian involvement in the election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign.In a June interview with CNN, Warner said “a lot of smoke” on these matters was worth investigating. “It does seem strange, it appears, that Russian-paid internet trolls who created bots were then able to put forward fake news, selective stories in a way that seemed targeted,” he said.In early October, shortly after The Washington Post published a story about an “Access Hollywood” tape featuring Trump bragging that his celebrityhood allowed him to grab women by the genitals, the WikiLeaks group released the first of its emails stolen from Podesta’s account.“Weird how that happens. What a remarkable coincidence,” GOP consultant Wilson said. “There was always something there the same day from Russia with love to bail him out.”Few political observers disagree that Clinton was a weak candidate, or that her campaign didn’t, in retrospect, make serious strategic mistakes. For example, she and her staff appeared to take Michigan and Wisconsin for granted, failing to make large voter outreach and turnout investments in them.“The Clinton campaign’s hubris may have contributed more to her defeat than any action the Russians took in this election,” said Neil Newhouse, a Republican pollster with the firm Public Opinion Strategies. “The fact that she represented ‘more of the same’ in a change environment, the campaign’s decision to essentially ignore key states and the inability to communicate a coherent economic message to middle-class voters are all at the root of her loss.”Still, her losing margins in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania were less than a percentage point – a total of about 78,000 votes in all three. Had she won those states, she would be president. Thus, every element in Trump’s favor was by definition a determinative factor ― be it Russian meddling or the announcements by then-FBI director James Comey that he was re-opening, and then re-closing, his investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state. “In the closely contested races, it was apparently just enough,” said Quinnipiac’s Malloy.Trump as of Thursday morning was still disputing Russia’s role in the U.S. election. At a news conference in Warsaw, Poland, he claimed: “I think it could very well have been Russia but I think it could well have been other countries.” He then added: “Nobody really knows for sure.”That view goes against the consensus analysis of the major U.S. intelligence agencies. The Office of National Intelligence released a report on Jan. 6 stating that Russia not only meddled in the presidential campaign, but specifically wanted Trump to defeat Clinton.“We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election. Russia’s goals were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump,” the report said. “We have high confidence in these judgments.”During his 17-month presidential campaign, Trump frequently praised Putin as a strong leader, even calling him a better one than then-President Barack Obama. When MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough pointed out that Putin has reportedly had political opponents and journalists murdered, Trump answered: “I think that our country does plenty of killing, too, Joe.”Trump’s Friday meeting with Putin will be his first as president and possibly his first ever, although that is unclear because of Trump’s conflicting statements in the past.In October 2013, Trump told late night host David Letterman that Putin was a “tough guy” and that he had “met him once.”In February 2014, Trump told Fox News that Putin had contacted him during his visit to Russia for his beauty pageant.In October 2015, he told talk radio host Michael Savage that he’d met Putin “a long time ago.”But at a July 2016 news conference, Trump said he had never met the Russian leader. “I never met Putin,” he said. “I don’t know who Putin is. He said one nice thing about me. He said I’m a genius. I said thank you very much to the newspaper and that was the end of it. I never met Putin.”Wilson said Trump’s continued kind words for the Russian strongman will come back to haunt Republicans, eventually. “Guys on my side just don’t care,” he said. “If we want to make GOP stand for the ‘Guys Of Putin,’ we’re well on our way.”"

He’s been in this game for more than two decades and has had a hand in casting just about every non-superhero blockbuster of the last few years. He’s also won two Emmys and is a member of the Casting Society of America, which set up our interview.The pride of being a trusted part of high-stakes projects is what he believes truly matters. “That’s a unique thing, and to me, that’s the reward,” Papsidera said. “You know, to have those relationships and ultimately have people trust you.” Papsidera is still a part of the Nolan family at this point because he’s reliable.Casting this second season of “Westworld” and maintaining that trust has been a new kind of challenge, though.“In any kind of fanboy world, you take extra care when people want to get that information out on the internet,” said Papsidera, who explained he’s had to give potential actors auditioning for the show fabricated scenes to read.He doesn’t reveal character arcs during the audition process, either.“We don’t really talk about where [the role] goes and what they do because there’s so many intricacies in ‘Westworld,’ and stories, and secrets,” said Papsidera. “You got to be very careful to navigate those waters correctly so it doesn’t get ruined for anyone.”Even more challenging this season is that new theme park “worlds” are entering the story in the new season. As expected, fans are already speculating what this will entail. The show revealed the existence of a shogun-themed world in the Season 1 finale, but it remains unclear which parks — or how many — will be involved in the second season.Papsidera has had to figure out a way to not reveal anything even in his casting calls, while still somehow finding the right actors for the roles.“If somebody’s aware you’re looking for Japanese actors that could play a period piece, you don’t [want fans to] figure out or discuss how that world is now fitting into ‘Westworld.’” Papsidera has used the utmost precaution and discretion. But this wouldn’t be a worthy article about “Westworld” if it didn’t have some wild reading of Nolan-related tea leaves.Co-showrunner Lisa Joy has already said that the show would “ultimately encounter other worlds,” but it has been unclear if that would mean multiple worlds as soon as Season 2.“It’s a huge cast, and it’s a monumental task,” said Papsidera. “Especially when you start to delve into different worlds, because then you’re pulling from entirely different talent pools.”Seems like “Westworld” might soon have a more global cast of characters.But finding the very best version of the new cast will continue to be the main challenge at hand. Papsidera fondly remembered a moment from earlier in his career when he was a bit more naive to the challenges of the task.“I brought up Daniel Day-Lewis for a project once, and somebody said, ‘If you can get Daniel Day-Lewis, you’re the most brilliant casting director in the world.’” (Day-Lewis is known for being extremely picky about which roles he chooses.)“Um, and ... I didn’t get Daniel Day-Lewis,” continued Papsidera. ”[This job] is about trying to expand your creativity as much as you can, but at the same time problem-solve and be realistic. We certainly have a big ambition with who we’re going to cast in ‘Westworld,’ but we felt we had the material and the team that people would be excited and want to be a part of.”Any chance the recently “retired” Day-Lewis might come out of retirement for the second season? That would be ambitious, but ultimately unlikely.“We’ll have to find out who the next Holy Grail is,” said Papsidera."

It noted, however, that the committee still has “serious concern” about the devastating bleaching that decimated the reef in 2016 and 2017. Federal and state governments need to “accelerate efforts” to meet the targets of Reef 2050, paying particular attention to land clearance and water quality issues, UNESCO added.Government officials in Australia celebrated the United Nations agency’s decision on Thursday, though appeared to disagree over who deserved more credit for the positive outcome.Federal Environment Minister Josh Frydenberg called the announcement a “big win for Australia and a big win for the Turnbull Government,” referring to Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. The Queensland government, however, disagreed with this assessment. The state’s environment minister, Steven Miles, told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. that Queensland had done most of the “heavy lifting” to prevent the reef, which is located off the state’s coast, from getting the “in danger” listing.This is the second time in recent years that the Great Barrier Reef, which was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1981, has escaped the “in danger” label. As The Sydney Morning Herald reports, the reef “narrowly avoided” the designation after lobbying efforts by the Australian government in 2015.UNESCO’s criteria for the “in danger” listing includes looking at how much deterioration of “natural beauty or scientific value” has been suffered by a natural site and whether human encroachment threatens its “integrity.”On Thursday, environmental groups disagreed with the UNESCO decision, with climate scientist Will Steffen saying if the severe bleaching it’s endured “isn’t enough to put the Great Barrier Reef in danger, I’m not sure what is.”“We’ve had 67 percent mortality on the northern section of the reef, the most pristine section,” Steffen, a professor at Australian National University, told ABC. “There is only one reason why that happened and that was the high ocean temperatures caused by the burning of fossil fuels.” The Reef 2050 plan has been criticized by environmentalists as inadequate as it doesn’t currently address the need to limit greenhouse gases to mitigate climate change.Greenpeace Australia expressed its disdain of the plan this week, sharing this statement on social media:The Great Barrier Reef, the world’s largest living structure, has suffered from severe mass bleaching four times in recorded history ― in 1998, 2002, 2016 and 2017. Scientists said earlier this year that, because of climate change, decline of the reef is now inevitable. "

The Chinese region reported Thursday that its customs agents had seized about 7.9 tons of ivory tusks valued at approximately $72 million. The ivory was concealed under a layer of frozen fish in a 40-foot container mailed from Malaysia.“This is a record high in quantity for a seizure of ivory tusks over the past 30 years,” the announcement of the seizure read.Authorities have arrested the owner of a Hong Kong trading company and two of his employees in connection with the discovery. They could each face up to $7 million in fines and nine years in prison for violating the territory’s Import and Export Ordinance and Protection of Endangered Species of Animals and Plants Ordinance.Under current Hong Kong law, residents can freely import and export any ivory removed from the wild before 1976. Ivory legally imported to Hong Kong between 1976 and 1990 may be traded within the territory with a special license to do so.Activists working to stop the poaching of elephants for their ivory tusks commended Tuesday’s seizure, but said it shines a light on the need to better crack down on organized ivory trade syndicates and strengthen Hong Kong’s laws, which they believe are widely flouted. “These tusks represent the lives of hundreds of elephants,” said Margaret Kinnaird, the head of the World Wildlife Fund’s global Wildlife Practice initiative, noting that nearly 90 percent of elephants in one part of Tanzania have disappeared due to poaching in the last four decades. “The magnitude of recent seizures in Asia only serves to highlight the enormity of the task ahead,” she added.Hong Kong is facing pressure from WWF and other conservation groups to strengthen its policies against the ivory trade.The territory ― which Save the Elephants, a nonprofit group, believes has more ivory items for sale than anywhere else in the world ― is weighing a bill that would ban the import and export of both worked and raw ivory by 2021 and would ban the possession and sale of any ivory obtained before 1990.Conservationists applauded the number of anti-poaching activists who showed up outside a hearing for the bill last month. “We are happy to see the Hong Kong community turn out in force today to protect elephants, to support the government’s plan to ban the ivory trade and increase maximum penalties for wildlife crime, and to firmly oppose any attempts to compensate the ivory traders for their stolen goods,” Alex Hofford of WildAid said at the time. “This level of support is a vindication of the tremendous efforts made by Hong Kong lawmakers to ensure a future for elephants.”"
54,ENTERTAINMENT,There Are Some Rumblings That TV Networks Are Fudging The Numbers,Maxwell Strachan,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/abc-nbc-cbs-retitling_us_595e74f2e4b0615b9e900603,The situation is evidently serious enough that Nielsen is meeting with TV industry executives next week.,2017-07-06,"Suddenly, there are rumblings that TV networks might be using the strategy more frequently as a way to gain an unfair edge over competitors.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/595e899f180000380067308a.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For years, major networks have quietly used a trick called “retitling” when trying to keep their ratings on a level playing field with competitors.It works something like this: When a popular show receives a ratings hit due to forces outside its control ― say, a big football game that pushes the show’s starting time back, or a holiday that sends viewers away from their TVs ― a network will slightly misspell the show name, for that day only, when logging it into Nielsen, a global information company that tracks ratings around the country.Historically speaking, the misspellings logged in Nielsen’s database allowed shows to correct for inconsistencies or irregularities unrelated to the show itself, and everyone, for the most part, was fine with it. “Retitling” was used sparingly, and the slightly higher numbers evened things out.Plus, “retitled numbers” were (and are) used only for publicity. The numbers are straightened out before they are handed over to advertisers.But, suddenly, there are rumblings that TV networks might be using the strategy more frequently as a way to gain an unfair advantage over competitors.Joe Flint of the Wall Street Journal published a story Thursday contending that lately networks have been retitling at a higher clip. ABC has logged the show “Wrld New Tonite” into the Nielsen system seven times during this TV season. But CBS has told Nielsen about a show called “CBS Evening Nws” 12 times. NBC has evidently broadcast 14 episodes of the “NBC Nitely News,” many more times than in previous years. The situation is evidently serious enough that Nielsen is meeting with TV industry executives about it next week. In a statement to HuffPost, the ratings company said it would not tolerate any networking working outside the “rigorous set of policy guidelines for how network clients can and should receive program and commercial ratings credit.” ″If we find a network working in contrast to this agreed-upon policy, we address the issue in a direct fashion as a way to maintain fairness and balance over all of our clients and the industry as a whole,” Nielsen added. Behind the scenes, the issue came to a head in early June, when NBC retitled the “NBC Nightly News” over five straight days between June 5 and June 9 ― a stretch in which there were two NBA Finals games and two Stanley Cup Finals games. In a statement to HuffPost, NBC defended the decision:Due to sports, all three evening newscasts [on NBC, ABC and CBS] would have been rated on the same day only once during the week of June 5: Tuesday evening. One head-to-head night does not accurately reflect an entire week of ratings, so Nightly News was retitled for the full week.It’s a fair point, and it’s not the first time a network has made such a decision. ABC retitled “Good Morning America” for a week back in 2011. And CBS retitled “Face the Nation” for an entire month last year. (Both those networks declined to comment when we contacted them.)But the difference here lies in the context, and the context is this: “World News Tonight” is besting “NBC Nightly News” in viewership for the first time in 21 years, creating an old-school ratings war and a dogged fight for every viewer.And someone evidently is unhappy enough with the use of “retitling” that a boring old TV tactic has suddenly been pushed out into the public sphere.

They also brought along the helmet that the character Kylo Ren wears in “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.”“The week we found out Hannah was pregnant, I discovered the Kylo Ren helmet on clearance,” Ariel told HuffPost. “Once we determined the due date was December, the release month of Episode VIII, the idea for the announcement snapped into place.”While posing with the helmet makes sense considering Kylo’s parents are Leia and Han, “Star Wars” fans will immediately notice a somewhat morbid twist to the announcement because (spoiler alert!) Kylo kills his father in “The Force Awakens.”Ariel’s brother, Zach, accompanied the couple to the park to help take the photo and later got the OK to post the final announcement on Reddit. Users quickly pointed out the Kylo Ren reference, but Ariel made it clear to HuffPost that he knew what he was getting into.“Whenever something like this pops up on the internet, snark will be snark; you can’t take it too seriously,” he said. “But at least in the case of the troubled Han/Kylo relationship, I’m in on the joke. I actually started throwing around this ’30 Rock’ Jack Donaghy quote soon after we settled on the announcement idea: ‘I want a family. A son I can throw a ball to and, when he’s older, have power struggles with.’ It’s all in good fun.”Ariel said Hannah, who is “less of a fan” of the galactic franchise, was “a huge sport” while they created the pregnancy announcement. The couple will welcome their first child in December.“I’m a big fan of Star Wars, and this seemed like a fun, silly way to break the news,” Ariel said."

Bruce had complained he was awakened by two automated calls about a missing teenager. Bruce’s email read, in part:“TRY to exercise some judgment and common sense about the timing of random calls to citizens … what do you expect me to DO at midnight about some juvenile in the city who does not tell her parents where she is? I have no role in finding other people’s thoughtless or runaway children.

The outlet noted that Bruce supplied them with a copy of the emails and that the police department confirmed that Carey’s response was authentic.Bruce, 67, is a former state representative, county commissioner and convicted criminal. He served jail time in 2012 for several felony crimes, including tax evasion and trying to influence a public servant.Carey said he does not regret sending out the alert and that it assisted in finding the missing teen. Bruce told Colorado Springs’ KKTV News he was “shocked” by Carey’s email, which he reportedly forwarded to Mayor John Suthers.However, Colorado Springs City Councilman Dave Geislinger told the Gazette he does not anticipate city involvement.“Incivility begets incivility,” Geislinger said. “And it’s kind of unrealistic to expect that somebody can send an email in a clearly uncivil tone and expect a civil response, that’s not the way humanity works.”David Lohr covers crime and missing persons.

The long July 4th weekend ― routinely a lucrative time for blockbusters ― suffered an 11 percent dip from last year, while summer grosses at large are down by 8 percent, according to Variety. So far, “Despicable Me 3” (this year’s 4th of July heavyweight), “Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man Tell No Tales,” “Cars 3,” “Transformers: The Last Knight,” “Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie,” “The Mummy,” “Alien: Covenant,” “Baywatch” and “King Arthur: Legend of the Sword” have all opened with established name recognition but lukewarm fanfare. Each suffered weaker grosses than its predecessor or did little to herald a promising new series. Meanwhile, “Baby Driver” and “All Eyez on Me” are the only original titles to pull in more than $20 million over a single weekend.That puts a lot of pressure on the rest of July’s upcoming movies to prove that stateside audiences don’t have total franchise fatigue.Good thing there’s a few heavy hitters on the horizon: This weekend brings “Spider-Man: Homecoming,” the delightful romp that’s on track to open northward of $100 million. (You can see the caution in the air, though: Sony, which needs a box-office win after “Rough Night,” “Life” and “Smurfs: The Lost Village” faltered, is reportedly predicting a more conservative $80 million.) One week after Peter Parker slings his webs, we’ll get the acclaimed “War for the Planet of the Apes,” which is expected to debut in a noble $50 million to $70 million range. The rest of summer’s releases are more of a crapshoot. Christopher Nolan tends to strike box-office gold, but his World War II epic “Dunkirk” could be cannibalized by the competition it faces in “Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets.” Meanwhile, “Girls Trip,” “Atomic Blonde” and “The Emoji Movie” have mainstream potential, but each will need favorable press and decent staying power to attract receipts that outpace the summer’s setbacks. The long-anticipated “Dark Tower” will be tasked with leading the charge in August, typically a dumping ground for second-tier blockbusters while studios prepare to pivot toward Oscar season and the holidays. There’s no other film on the calendar that’s poised to rescue 2017′s flailing summer statistics, though “Detroit,” “Annabelle: Creation,” “The Glass Castle,” “The Hitman’s Bodyguard” and “Logan Lucky” pine for decent grosses. This state of affairs forms roughly the same narrative that hit the 2015 and 2016 summer seasons. Both logged decent overall grosses thanks to a few key movies (“Jurassic World,” “Avengers: Age of Ultron” and “Inside Out” in 2015; “Finding Dory,” “Captain America: Civil War” and “The Secret Life of Pets” in 2016), but the bulk of sequels and spinoffs fizzled out in comparison to their predecessors. Eight percent is a big dip for 2017, leaving the second half of summer with a significant deficit to fill and no animated sleeper hit to help.It’s been 14 years since a movie not based on an established property ― 2003′s “Finding Nemo” ― ruled the summer box office, once the terrain of “Jaws,” “Grease,” “E.T.,” “Ghostbusters,” “Top Gun” and “Men in Black.”It’s fine, though: Get ready for “The Nut Job 2: Nutty by Nature,” coming soon to a theater near you for no good reason."

In a city like Miami, where a lack of public transportation makes driving a necessity for working class people, that fear is palpable.I grew up undocumented here with my family. My heart dropped if my parents called me to say they had been involved in a minor traffic incident or pulled over by police. We understood that the simplest interaction with the police could potentially lead to detainment and possible deportation. And my family would be split apart.Those fears have exacerbated because of the harsh anti-immigrant policies espoused by the Trump administration. Trump has threatened to pull federal funding from “sanctuary cities,” which choose not to turn over suspected undocumented immigrants to federal immigration agencies. Miami-Dade County was the first municipality to comply with Trump’s executive action and is currently facing a lawsuit by the University of Miami Law Clinic and the ACLU over its decision to put immigrants living in the County at risk.Officials, such as the Miami Dade County mayor, have claimed when making the decision to comply with Trump’s order on sanctuary cities that police officers would not act as immigration officials.Reality has shown otherwise. Law enforcement officials in jurisdictions in South Florida have turned undocumented immigrants over to federal officials for deportation after traffic stops. Marcos Antonio Huete, a 31 year-old Honduran immigrant, was riding his bike to work when he was hit by a pickup truck. As he lay injured on the side of the road, a police officer from the Monroe County Sheriff’s office showed up at the scene and questioned him about his immigration status before offering medical care. “You illegal? Are you illegal? Citizen or no? You speak English? You got ID? You got a passport, visa, what,” the officer is seen asking Huete in the footage taken by his body cam.After his release from the hospital, Huete was fined $75 and detained by federal immigration agents who took him to the Krome Detention Center in Miami Florida, where he awaits deportation proceedings.Not long after the incident with Huete, the same officer, identified by Univision as David Lariz, pulled over another undocumented immigrant for an alleged traffic violation and questioned him regarding his legal status.“So why don’t you have your legal documents?” Officer Lariz is seen asking Nestor Alfredo Duarte, who he forced to repeatedly say he was “illegal” and only had an Argentinean ID on his possession. “Sixteen years you’ve been in the United States and you haven’t bothered to do anything to get anything?” Officer Lariz is shown asking Duarte. After their interaction, Officer Lariz reported Duarte to border patrol. Duarte now also faces deportation proceedings.In similar fashion, father of two Raul Quiroga ended up detained and facing possible deportation after a fender bender. Quiroga, who lived in the United States for 15 years, was driving a pick up truck when he was involved in minor collision. A state trooper showed up and asked Quiroga for his driver’s license and registration.Florida is not among the states that enacted laws permitting undocumented immigrants to obtain a drivers license, so Quiroga was detained and eventually taken to the Broward Transitional Center, a private immigration detention facility. His family is now left to make ends meet without Quiroga.It’s clear that politicians have broken promises that police would not act as immigration enforcement agents. Now, immigrant families are suffering the consequences of the cruel and inhumane anti-immigrant policies that have trickled down from the Trump administration to our local governments. At a time when Congress is voting on harsh anti-immigrant legislation like the “No Sanctuary for Criminals Act” or “Kate’s Law,” which seek to erode the trust between the public and authorities, we need local governments to stand up for what is right and protect vulnerable immigrant communities.Thomas Kennedy is a writing fellow for the Center for Community Change."

I have known Dave since 2004 or 2005 when he opened a small gun shop in Connecticut just over the Massachusetts line. Dave had previously been in the car business as a broker, he had done quite well, but, being a gun nut, once he had some dough in his pocket he did what we all do, he bought some gun inventory and opened a shop.One thing led to another and within three or four years Dave had moved to a much larger location and now had a gun shop that was maybe the second largest store in the whole state. And since Connecticut is a fairly small state and Dave’s store was situated right off an exit of Interstate 91 ― “easy on, easy off” ― he got customers from as far away as the Danbury area, one of whom was Nancy Lanza, who showed up some time in 2011 or 2012 with her young son, Adam, and purchased an AR-15.Two days after the Sandy Hook massacre, as Dave was about to close for the night, a squad of helmeted ATF agents carrying rifles and wearing body armor drove up in two Humvees and charged into the shop. Oh yes, they were immediately followed into Dave’s store by some media folks who had been alerted by the ATF that something connected to the Sandy Hook mess was about to go down.Let me interject one point here that needs to be understood. I heard about Sandy Hook while I was standing behind the counter of my gun shop; I closed the shop immediately and went home. But later that night after the shooter was identified, I went back to the shop and pored through my records to find out whether or not I was the dealer who had sold the gun. Since it was a rifle, Nancy Lanza could have come into Massachusetts and bought the gun from me. I would have been required to ship the gun to a Connecticut dealer, so I was able to quickly check and I knew that the gun hadn’t come from me. I can guarantee you that every gun dealer in Connecticut and Massachusetts was looking through their books that same night in the hopes that the AR wasn’t sold by them.The ATF spent the next several weeks examining every gun sale that Dave ever made. They also suspended his license which he never got back. Eventually they found a sale of a hunting rifle which was improperly made, but it was still a violation of 4473 law so they could now build a case. A year later, having absorbed the loss of his entire business, Dave took a misdemeanor plea for the sale of the hunting rifle and also agreed never to go back into the business of selling guns. All the result of a legal sale of an AR-15.Back in 1995 my good friend in Fairfax, Wayne-o LaPierre, took a lot of flak for calling the ATF a bunch of ‘jack-booted thugs.’ Wayne-o has never been known to be as a master of the understatement, but when I think about how Dave LaGuercia was treated by the ATF, I have to say that Wayne-o was right. And by the way, every, single gun-shop owner throughout the Northeast knows what happened to Dave because every shop is visited on a regular basis by the sales reps for S&W, Ruger and Glock, so news gets around.I’m not trying in any way to justify Sandy Hook or the lethal dangers of an AR-15. What I am saying is that there are reasons why people in the gun business don’t trust the government to regulate their industry in a proper and positive way. Something to think about the next time an advocate for gun violence prevention gets into a discussion with a gun nut about his guns."

For answers, I turned to security and disarmament experts Miriam Struyk, programs director at PAX, and Richard Moyes, managing director of Article 36, both of whom have participated in efforts to ban landmines, cluster munitions, nuclear weapons and autonomous weapons.The following interview has been heavily edited for brevity, but you can listen to it in its entirety here.The United Nations is about to complete negotiations that are expected to result in an international ban on nuclear weapons as early as July 7. Why is this ban important, even if nuclear weapons states don’t sign?Moyes: The use of a single nuclear weapon would potentially kill hundreds of thousands of people. The use of multiple nuclear weapons could have devastating impacts for society and the environment as a whole. These weapons should be illegal because their effects cannot be contained or managed in a way that avoids massive suffering. By changing that legal background, we’re potentially in position to put much more pressure on [the nuclear] states to move towards disarmament as a long-term agenda.Struyk: For too long nuclear weapons were mythical, symbolic weapons, but we never spoke about what these weapons actually do and whether we think that’s illegal. This treaty brings back the notion of what do these weapons do and do we want that? It also brings democratization of security policy. This process was brought about by several states, by NGOs [nongovernmental organizations], the ICRC [International Committee of the Red Cross] and other actors. It’s so important that it’s actually citizens speaking about nukes and whether we think they’re acceptable or not.What is an autonomous weapon system and why are you worried about them?Moyes: Autonomous weapons are really an issue of the challenges that new and emerging technologies present to society, particularly when they’re emerging in the military sphere — a sphere which is essentially about how we’re allowed to kill each other or how we’re allowed to use technologies to kill each other. Autonomous weapons are a movement in technology to a point where we will see computers and machines making decisions about where to apply force, about what objects to destroy, or about who to kill.One of the ways we’ve sought to orientate to this is by thinking about the concept of meaningful human control. What are the human elements that we feel are important to retain? We are going to see more and more autonomy within military operations. But in certain critical functions around how targets are identified and how force is applied and over what period of time — those are areas where we will potentially see an erosion of a level of human, essentially moral, engagement that is fundamentally important to retain.Struyk: It depends a lot on your definition of course. I’m still, in a way, a bit of an optimist by saying that perhaps we can prevent the emergence of lethal autonomous weapon systems. But I also see some similarities between lethal autonomous weapons systems and what we had with nuclear weapons a few decades ago — this can lead to an arms race, to more global insecurity, and also to warfare.An argument in favor of autonomous weapons is that they can ideally make decisions better than humans and potentially reduce civilian casualties. How do you address that argument?Struyk: We’ve had that debate with other weapon systems, as well, where the technological possibilities were not what they were promised to be as soon as they were used.It’s an unfair debate because it’s mainly from states with developed industries who are most likely the ones using some form of lethal autonomous weapons systems first. Flip the question and say, ‘what if these systems will be used against your soldiers or in your country?’ Suddenly you enter a whole different debate. I’m highly skeptical of people who say it could actually be beneficial.Moyes: I feel like there are assertions of “goodies” and “baddies” and our ability to label one from the other. To categorize people and things in society in such an accurate way is somewhat illusory and something of a misunderstanding of the reality of conflict.Any claims that we can somehow perfect violence in a way where it can be distributed by machinery to those who deserve to receive it and that there’s no tension or moral hazard in that — that is extremely dangerous as an underpinning concept because, in the end, we’re talking about embedding categorizations of people and things within a micro-bureaucracy of algorithms and labels.Violence in society is a human problem, and it needs to continue to be messy to some extent if we’re going to recognize it as a problem.What is the process right now for getting lethal autonomous weapons systems banned?Struyk: We started the international Campaign to Stop Killer Robots in 2013 — it immediately gave a push to the international discussion, including the one on the Human Rights Council and within the [Convention on] Conventional Weapons (CCW) in Geneva. We saw a lot of debates there in 2013, 2014 and 2015 and the last one was in April.Unfortunately, we’re in a bit of a silence mode right now. But that doesn’t mean there’s no progress. We have 19 states who called for a ban, and more than 70 states within the CCW framework discussing this issue. We know from other treaties that you need these kind of building blocks.What is most important for people to understand about nuclear and autonomous weapon systems?Struyk: Both systems go way beyond the discussion about weapons systems: it’s about what kind of world and society do we want to live in. None of these — not killer robots, not nuclear weapons — are an answer to any of the threats that we face right now, be it climate change, be it terrorism. It’s not an answer. It’s only adding more fuel to an already dangerous world.Moyes: Nuclear weapons — they’ve somehow become a very abstract, rather distant issue. Simple recognition of the scale of humanitarian harm from a nuclear weapon is the most substantial thing — hundreds of thousands killed and injured. [Leaders of nuclear states are] essentially talking about incinerating hundreds of thousands of normal people — probably in a foreign country — but recognizable, normal people. The idea that that can be approached in some ways glibly or confidently at all is I think very disturbing. And expecting that at no point will something go wrong — I think it’s a complete illusion.On autonomous weapons — what sort of society do we want to live in, and how much are we prepared to hand over to computers and machines? I think handing more and more violence over to such processes does not augur well for our societal development."
65,WOMEN,From 'Handmaid's' To Hillary: How Women Are Empowered (Or Controlled) Via Fashion,"Jennifer Rand, ContributorLawyer, political activist, middle-aged mom of two teens, and ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/from-handmaids-to-hillary-how-girls-and-women_us_595eaa40e4b08f5c97d06845,How we humans clothe ourselves has historically been a cultural landmine.,2017-07-06,"<p>Posted in a high school bathroom, a girl expresses her frustration with the school’s sexist dress code.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/595ebce12100001a00fc5b43.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Overheard last week in my car as I shuttled around my 15-year-old daughter (DD) and 17-year-old son (DS) for some last-minute vacation shopping:DS: Jake and some other friends said I need new shirts. They’re not fashionable.This is the first time I had ever heard my son utter the word “fashionable.” Since babyhood, I could literally buy him anything and, as long as I didn’t drag him shopping, and it didn’t make him itch, he’d be good with it.DD to DS: Well, maybe that one Hawaiian shirt you wore last week…Me (explaining, to no one in particular): I got that for a Hawaiian luau. For that one purpose―DD to DS: Fashionable for boys is about brands. It’s easier for you than for girls.Me: <sigh>That’s for damn sure.How we humans clothe ourselves has historically been a cultural landmine, particularly when it comes to gender. It begins almost from birth, when baby leaves the hospital with either a pink or blue blanket. While societal norms shift over time and across geography, males and females have been expected to fall neatly into one or the other gender, and dress accordingly.When I was very young, a girl who wore pants and short hair might be seen as a “tomboy.” When I was a teen, a boy who took special care of his hair and wore pink might be seen as “gay” and a girl who dressed in a way that revealed too much skin (in someone else’s opinion) might be seen as a “slut.” In all of these cases, such labels were certainly not considered to be complimentary, and a stigma often attached.At least in some parts of the country (read: Trump country), views have not changed that much. In my part of the country — a blue county in a blue state — tolerance for individuality when it comes to dress and gender has come a long way, and gives me hope for the future. Nevertheless, as Americans, we still have a long, long way to go.Now: If a young girl dresses in so-called boys clothing or looks “boyish,” we might leap to the assumption that she is “transgender,” and maybe she/he is. But maybe we should just let her be a human being, and not feel the need to lock her in to one of two genders when she’s only six years old.Now: If a girl wears a “revealing” costume and heavy makeup on stage for a dance or other competition, we might take her mother to task for inappropriately “sexualizing” her daughter. But maybe it is really the adult onlookers who are inappropriately sexualizing an innocent, young girl.Now: Many high schools, even in progressive counties throughout the United States, have dress codes that are more restrictive of girls than of boys. A girl who violates a dress code may be sent home from school to change her clothes. These sexist dress codes presume that it is more important for a high school boy not to be distracted by a girl’s bare shoulders or thighs, than for the girl to be allowed to dress as she chooses. For the girl, it is demeaning to be called out in class for how she is dressed and disruptive to her education to be sent home and miss school. But maybe we should consider the girl’s needs and feelings, and put responsibility on others not to sexualize and stigmatize her choice of how to express her individuality.Now: We continue to ask what the victim of a rape was wearing when she was assaulted, as if the answer might somehow exculpate the rapist. “She was asking for it” is a typical reaction from some if they hear the rape victim was wearing something they consider to be “sexy.” In this worldview, choice of clothing apparently equals consent for sexual assault. Maybe though, we should simply hold rapists accountable for their violent and criminal acts. Do we let off a murderer if he grabs a gun out of his victim’s hand and shoots her with it? Do we let off a burglar if he walks through an unlocked door and steals a priceless work of art off of the wall?There is power in expressing one’s individuality. It is empowering to a girl or woman to be permitted to choose how to dress, regardless of how unconventional it may seem to society. Just ask some of our most famous cultural icons, from Marilyn and Madonna to Lady Gaga and Miley Cyrus. Ariana Grande has defiantly informed her legions of fans on Twitter that a woman’s choice of clothing is part of her freedom of choice as a woman, and an expression of her own unique personality: On the other hand, rules restricting freedom of dress can have the opposite impact, with negative consequences. Cultural and symbolic examples of this can be found everywhere, including two fictional protagonists, who are currently featured in motion pictures.At one end of the extreme is the puritanical dystopian world depicted in “The Handmaid’s Tale.” Women in this Margaret Atwood novel/Hulu series have been stripped of all power and control over their lives and the handmaids’ sole function in life is to bear children. To symbolize their total subservience to men, the story’s protagonist, Offred, and the other handmaids must wear red and are required to be covered from head to toe at all times. Extreme or fundamentalist religiosity in one form or another is similar in that complete modesty in dress is a requirement for women, and sexuality exists only for procreation. Given conservative political trends, such as the assault on women’s rights to choose for themselves when they bear children, women who have recently protested state measures infringing on abortion rights have taken to wearing handmaids’ costumes. The symbolic meaning is clear: When powerful men strip women of some of their rights, where does it end?Then, at the other end of the extreme, we find Princess Diana, also known as Wonder Woman. Diana is born on a utopian island, where women reign supreme (and indeed there are no men to interfere with or control them). They wear revealing clothing—a strapless bodysuit—all the time, including during battle. Wonder Woman is a mythical superhero with superhuman powers. She is virtually invincible and indestructible. She also doesn’t rely on men to achieve success in life and, indeed, the character was originally inspired by some of the earliest American feminists, such as Margaret Sanger. In the movie, to further highlight the dichotomy between the women of Themyscira and the real world, a blissfully naïve Diana takes her feminist sensibilities with her to World War I-era Great Britain. She negotiates the outfit she must wear to walk the streets of London (finally deciding on an unusual but still more conventional look, with black hat, modestly long skirt, and belted jacket), but as soon as she starts her heroic assault on the German forces as Wonder Woman, she’s back in her badass bustier. Symbolically, part of her power is in her ability to break free of society’s attempts to keep her in check and under wraps, so to speak.Returning to “real life,” a beach resort town recently fought back against a woman who had asserted her right to go topless on the “family” beaches of Ocean City, Maryland. Surely this woman had a point. Why is it legal for a man to go sunbathing topless and not a woman? The traditionalist answer—to protect families from seeing bare breasts—is mired firmly in our own puritanical sensibilities, whether we realize this or not. The sexualization of female but not male nipples (many bikinis reveal plenty of flesh but the nipples always remain under cover) is a cultural and societal construct and modesty laws blindly follow this construct. Indeed, many if not all of the children on the beach have likely been breastfed by their mother. How does this law protect them? So what if they see a bare-breasted woman on a beach? We effectively send the message to these children that female body parts are taboo and shameful sexual objects, a belief that will continue to be perpetuated.Symbolism when it comes to women and clothing pervades real world business and politics as well. Men can simply wear a nice suit and tie with a crisp white shirt, and call it a day. No one notices or cares (or asks about the designer). By contrast, Hillary Clinton made an enormous splash back in the ’90s when she famously (infamously?) began eschewing traditional dresses or skirt suits for pantsuits. She continues to be known for her multitude of pantsuits, and last November, many women and their daughters showed up to the polls in a symbolic pantsuit as they cast their vote for a woman to hold the most powerful office in the free world.Ironically, when I was a young attorney at a large, conservative law firm back in the 1990s, hardly any women dared to wear pants to work, but wearing short skirts was considered perfectly fine. Compare that with today’s high school girls, who are expected to cover themselves up during school hours, apparently to avoid distracting boys. And if there’s any doubt to how extreme these modesty rules can be, just take the recent case of a North Carolina high school senior with a 4.4 GPA, who was suspended for a dress code violation and missed her own graduation.Dress or decorum codes have also been imposed in the U.S. House of Representatives by the Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan. Specifically, female journalists are not permitted to go sleeveless.The double bind with which we women have always had to navigate continues on—be “feminine,” but “sexy,” but not too sexy, and dress accordingly. But wouldn’t it be Wonder-ful if we could all express our individuality through clothing and not be endlessly judged in an attempt to suppress our superpowers?This article has been updated to include the decorum rule in the House of Representatives that has been used to exclude women reporters wearing sleeveless tops or dresses."

And we mean this in the best possible sense.The mayor of a small fishing village in southern Mexico recently fulfilled one of the duties of the job by marrying a crocodile.Victor Aguilar, mayor of San Pedro Huamelula, got hitched to a fairly small reptile on June 30, as part of an indigenous tradition supposed to bring good fortune to local fishermen.No crocodile tears were shed when the bride showed up in a beautiful white wedding dress perfectly tailored to her dimensions. A white ribbon was tied around her mouth to prevent any injuries, according to the Spanish language website Zocalo.com.mx.In the strictly symbolic ceremony, the mayor represents the prince of the Chontales, while the crocodile represents the princess of the Huaves. Tradition has it that the two indigenous groups battled over fishing rights until a Chontal prince fell in love with a Huave princess, according to CNN.The ceremony has been conducted since 1789, and is currently incorporated into a festival honoring the town’s patron saint, St. Peter, according to the Spanish language site Imparcial Oaxaca.This year, the chosen crocodile was given the name Ema Narváez Muñoz, after Aguilar’s real wife, who held the reptile during the ceremony, Zocalo.com.mx reported.After the nuptials, the couple did enjoy a first dance.

70,SCIENCE,'Bergxit': One Of The Largest Icebergs On Record Set To Break From Antarctic Shelf,Chris D'Angelo,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/larsen-c-ice-shelf-iceberg_us_595d1c68e4b02734df359334,Experts say the chunk of ice will be larger than the island of Bali.,2017-07-05,An image released by NASA in November of the rift in the Larsen C ice shelf.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586f47aa1200002e00ad5e6c.jpeg?cache=L7XAVxl1hJ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — When it splits off, the Delaware-sized chunk of ice now barely clinging to one of Antarctica’s largest ice shelves will become one of the most massive icebergs in recorded history, scientists say.For over two years, the U.K.-based Project MIDAS has been monitoring a large, fast-moving rift in the Larsen C ice shelf, located on the northern end of the Antarctic Peninsula. On Wednesday, researchers with the European Space Agency released a detailed analysis of the soon-to-be iceberg. Data collected from ESA’s CryoSat satellite, which measures and monitors polar ice in Greenland and Antarctica, shows the iceberg will likely have an area of more than 2,500 square miles — larger than the island of Bali in Indonesia.It’s expected to be about 620 feet thick and contain about 277 cubic miles of ice, according to ESA. Below the surface, the iceberg could reach a depth of nearly 700 feet. “This is a single piece which is remarkable I guess because it’s of somewhat biblical proportions,” Mark Drinkwater, head of the mission science division at ESA’s European Space Research and Technology Centre, told Mashable. In a post to Twitter, Drinkwater said the hype around the impending separation has given rise to the term “bergxit.” Researchers warn the iceberg will likely be so large that it could pose a risk to maritime traffic. “Whole or in pieces, ocean currents could drag it north, even as far as the Falkland Islands,” located east of South America’s southern peninsula, Anna Hogg of the University of Leeds said in a statement. “If so it could pose a hazard for ships in Drake Passage” ― a stretch of ocean between South America’s Cape Horn and Antarctica.At 21,000 square miles, Larsen C is the largest ice shelf in the region. In recent years, however, what started as a small fracture has moved rapidly through the frozen structure, widening to more than 1,000 feet.During the month of December, the rift grew by more than 10 miles, followed by another 6 miles in the first few weeks of January. Between May 25 and May 31, it grew by an astounding 11 miles — over 1.5 miles per day.Today, the fissure is over 120 miles long, and only about three miles from reaching the ocean, according to ESA’s new analysis.“The iceberg remains attached to the ice shelf, but its outer end is moving at the highest speed ever recorded on this ice shelf,” researchers with Project MIDAS wrote in a blog post last week. “We still can’t tell when calving will occur — it could be hours, days or weeks — but this is a notable departure from previous observations.” Project MIDAS estimates the calving event will remove more than 10 percent of the Larsen C shelf, leaving the ice at “its most retreated position ever recorded.”Along with fundamentally changing the Antarctic Peninsula, scientists worry a break-off could destabilize the entire shelf, meaning Larsen C could be headed for a similar fate as nearby Larsen A and Larsen B, which collapsed and disintegrated in 1995 and 2002, respectively. Larsen B’s vanishing act is highlighted in the NASA video below: In 2014, over a decade after Larsen B’s collapse, scientists determined the event was triggered by rising air temperatures.Since ice shelves float on the ocean’s surface, the impending calving event won’t immediately raise sea levels. An event of this scale, however, could destabilize the entire shelf, resulting in its disintegration and the release of the glacier ice it holds back ― which ultimately would raise sea levels."

72,WORLD NEWS,Newly Discovered Photo Suggests Amelia Earhart Survived Plane Crash (UPDATED),David Lohr,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amelia-earhart-survived-plane-crash-photo-japanese_us_595cfac6e4b0da2c73265d82,Researchers believe the famed pilot may have been captured by the Japanese.,2017-07-05,"Front page of the New York Daily News dated July 3, 1937.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/595cfc941500006303bfc227.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Investigators trying to determine what happened to Amelia Earhart more than 80 years ago now believe a newly discovered photograph shows she survived her final flight and was captured by the Japanese.“When you see the analysis that’s been done, I think it leaves no doubt to the viewers,” Shawn Henry, former executive assistant director for the FBI told NBC News.The photo shows a woman who resembles Earhart and a man who appears to be her navigator, Fred Noonan, on a dock in the Marshall Islands. The Japanese ship, the Koshu, can be seen in the background towing what investigators believe could be Earhart’s Lockheed Electra plane.The photo was discovered by Les Kinney, a retired U.S. Treasury agent who has spent more than a decade searching for clues in the case. He found it in a former “top secret” file at the National Archives, and believes it was taken in 1937, the same year the legendary pilot vanished during an attempted round-the-world flight.However, officials at the US National Archives told Gizmodo the photograph is undated and they have yet to uncover any evidence that the photo was taken specifically in 1937.“There is no confirmation on either a date or content in the photograph from the National Archives,” said James P. Pritchett, the director of public and media communications at the National Archives.Kinney, though, said the image “clearly indicates that Earhart was captured by the Japanese.”“It was misfiled,” Kinney says of the photo in a clip from the documentary. “That’s the only reason I was able to find it.”Kinney’s work and Henry’s analysis will be presented in the two-hour documentary Amelia Earhart: The Lost Evidence.They believe the photo was taken by a spy before the pair of aviators were imprisoned in Saipan, where they ultimately died.Other researchers have speculated that Earhart did not die in a plane crash, but instead spent her final days surviving as a castaway on the island of Nikumaroro, Kiribati. As evidence of this theory, the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery told CNN last year that an unidentified skeleton found on the island in 1940 ― initially misidentified as male ― strongly resembled Earhart. However, no definitive identification has been made.Japan’s Foreign Ministry, Defense Ministry and National Archives said they have no records of Earhart or Noonan being in their custody. However, many records from that time did not survive World War II, WTVJ News reported.The History Channel is running the documentary on July 9 at 9 p.m. ET.Tips? Feedback?
