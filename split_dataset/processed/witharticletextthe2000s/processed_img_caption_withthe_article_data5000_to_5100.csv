In fact, even the tiniest Falcons fans are getting in the spirit. Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta (CHOA) posted photos of young patients decked out in their Falcons gear on Facebook. One special fan is 17-month-old Wyatt Keeton.Wyatt was born at 37 weeks and diagnosed with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, a rare form of dwarfism. He was later diagnosed with spinal cord stenosis, a condition that commonly occurs in dwarfism when a child’s head is disproportionate to his or her smaller frame and causes pressure on the spinal cord. “Cervical collars were used to reduce pressure and avoid surgery,” CHOA representative Chrissie Gallentine told The Huffington Post. “Today, thanks to a fashionable set of 30 collars, Wyatt’s spinal stenosis is almost completely resolved ― and there is no surgery in his future.”Another little Falcons fan in the hospital is 15-month-old Ella.When she was 7 months old, Ella was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer called Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). She’s been living at the Aflac Cancer Center of CHOA for about two months. During the NFC Championship game, Elle wore a special Falcons hospital gown that her grandmother made. CHOA has a special relationship with the Atlanta Falcons. Before the NFC Championship game, the network of hospitals made a special “hype video” starring patients and staff.“Matt Ryan and the Atlanta Falcons have been big supporters of Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta,” Gallentine told HuffPost. “To celebrate, we hosted a pre-Super Bowl Pep Rally on Tuesday in support of our Atlanta Falcons.”Atlanta Falcons cheerleaders and Freddie the Falcon joined CHOA patients and staff for the pep rally, which featured arts and crafts, a photo booth, special T-shirts and a dance party with a live DJ.

But did you know parents now have a new way to introduce Beyoncé’s music to their babies? Rockabye Baby ― a company that produces lullaby versions of pop and rock songs ― announced that it will release an album of baby-friendly Beyoncé hits.“Beyoncé is a cultural icon ― a socially conscious artist, feminist, business woman, mother and obviously so much more,” Rockabye Baby co-creator and VP Lisa Roth told The Huffington Post. “Who she is makes this release special for us. The fact that our release is happening close to her pregnancy announcement is purely coincidental, but also special.”Though Rockabye Baby began as a purely rock-focused series, over time the creators have realized that “every genre has its rock stars,” Roth explained. She added, “I can’t think of a more relevant rock star right now than Beyoncé.”One of the icon’s many hits that will appear on the album is the lullaby version of”Single Ladies,” which is available for listening online ahead of its Feb. 24 release date. “What we always hope is that our albums bring some joy and fun to the experience of parenthood, that we provide music parents recognize and love, and that they can share with their little ones,” Roth explained.“Beyoncé is a cultural touchstone for many, especially right now,” she added. People care about her. With everything going on in the world, how great that her pregnancy announcement appears to be providing a little light and hope.”Parents can pre-order the 13-track album on iTunes. "

4,POLITICS,Republicans Look To Block EPA From Tackling Climate Change,Chris D'Angelo,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gary-palmer-bill-epa_us_58949441e4b0406131365066,"“This is the legislative equivalent of trying to ban fire trucks while your house is burning.""",2017-02-03,"Rep. Gary Palmer (R-Ala.) claimed last year that <a href=""https://www.huffpost.com/entry/gary-palmer-climate-change_n_6673388"" role=""link"" class="" js-entry-link cet-internal-link"" data-vars-item-name=""global temperature data has been manipulated by the government"" data-vars-item-type=""text"" data-vars-unit-name=""58949441e4b0406131365066"" data-vars-unit-type=""buzz_body"" data-vars-target-content-id=""https://www.huffpost.com/entry/gary-palmer-climate-change_n_6673388"" data-vars-target-content-type=""buzz"" data-vars-type=""web_internal_link"" data-vars-subunit-name=""article_body"" data-vars-subunit-type=""component"" data-vars-position-in-subunit=""7"">global temperature data has been manipulated by the government</a>. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5894a3981900003400e09d9a.jpeg?cache=xHJG4q0TKu&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"GOP lawmakers have their sights set on stripping the Environmental Protection Agency of its power to take action on climate change.Last week, Rep. Gary Palmer (R-Ala.), a climate change denier, introduced the “Stopping EPA Overreach Act of 2017,” a resolution that seeks to rein in what he and dozens of other Republicans see as an abuse of statutory authority.“No Federal agency has the authority to regulate greenhouse gases under current law” and “no attempt to regulate greenhouse gases should be undertaken without further Congressional action,” it reads. Initially introduced as H.R. 3880 in 2015, the measure would rewrite the Clean Air Act to exclude greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, from air pollutants the EPA is able to regulate. Additionally, it would repeal two Obama administration climate regulations: the Clean Power Plan and a rule setting methane emission standards for oil and gas operations.Liz Perera, climate policy director at the Sierra Club, said the resolution would make it all but impossible for the federal government to combat a climate crisis that is already driving extreme weather.“This is the legislative equivalent of trying to ban fire trucks while your house is burning,” she told The Huffington Post in an email, adding its sponsors “should be embarrassed for so blatantly ignoring reality and ashamed of themselves for so recklessly endangering our communities.”Since President Donald Trump’s surprise election win, the EPA has found itself facing an uncertain future.Both Trump and his nominee to lead the agency, Scott Pruitt, appear set on dismantling it. The Trump team is looking to cut the EPA’s budget by $815 million, including $513 million from states and tribal assistance grants and $193 million from climate programs, according to a report last week by Axios. Last week, the EPA froze its grant programs and told its staff not to post to social media or communicate with the press, as HuffPost reported. The agency has not posted to Twitter since Trump took office.Clearly unsatisfied with the idea of gutting the agency, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) has drafted a bill to “completely abolish” it.In an email Friday, Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University, expressed his disgust with what’s happening in Congress. “With the sideshow of Donald Trump serving as a distraction, the real damage is being done quietly by congressional republicans as they ram through a Koch Brothers-driven agenda to undermine efforts to combat climate change and to incentivize the environment-damaging fossil fuels they profit by,” he wrote. “It is obscene—it is an attack on the American people and indeed humanity, and it must be stopped.”As of Friday, Palmer’s resolution had 114 co-sponsors ― all of them Republicans. It has been referred to four separate committees but not yet been scheduled for a hearing.Neither the EPA nor Palmer’s office responded to HuffPost’s request for comment Friday. "
5,COMEDY,This 1979 'SNL' Script Is Basically The Blueprint For Trump's Women In The Workplace Talk,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-women-in-the-workforce_us_5894be84e4b040613136ab1d,Why are two men tackling this topic?,2017-02-03,Bill Murray and Dan Akroyd in a 1979 sketch that seems ripped from today's headlines.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5894bf7e25000034080b6c28.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On Friday, two male CEOs were scheduled to speak about women in the workplace at a meeting with President Donald Trump. We weren’t there to hear it, but perhaps their discussion kicked off like this:“Any woman who wants a career, she’s got two problems ― one, her career; two, this baby thing. I don’t care who she is, what she says ― there isn’t a broad alive who doesn’t feel unfulfilled if she doesn’t have a baby.”That’s Bill Murray playing “Brad” in a 1979 “Saturday Night Live” sketch called “Women’s Problems,” in which six guys tackle the women’s issues of the day on a fake TV show. Another character in the sketch, “Craig,” was played by Gary Busey, now a vocal Trump supporter. We couldn’t dig up the video, but here are some highlights from a transcript: Steve (Dan Akroyd): We’ve got a lot of women’s problems to discuss..Also this:Craig: If they could just make a decision and stick to it! Steve: There you go. Mike: Exactly, Craig. You get tired of hearing it, man? Brad: I think I may want a kid.. when I’m 40, late 40’s, something like that. If that happens, I’ll divorce my wife and marry a girl in her 20’s. Mike: Right on! Brad: I’ll take that chance. That’s life. But you’re not gonna hear me whining about it all the time. Steve: Well, that brings up another terrible women’s problem - whining. That is a problem.[the men argue this point between themselves]And so on.Thirty-eight years later, Trump is employing a similar strategy in real life. Doug McMillon, CEO of Walmart, and Mark Weinberger, CEO of the consulting firm EY, were set to speak about “Women in the Workforce” at a meeting of Trump’s CEO advisory board on Friday, The Wall Street Journal reports.Seventeen business leaders were reportedly in attendance, including three women ― General Motors’ Mary Barra, IBM’s Ginni Rometty and PepsiCo chief Indra Nooyi. But they were there to speak about tax, trade and regulatory issues, according to the Journal. (Ivanka Trump, the president’s elder daughter, was also there. She often promotes herself as a supporter of “women who work.”)On the one hand, it’s refreshing that Barra, Nooyi and Rometty don’t have to carry the burden of speaking for all women ― often a problem when there are so few in a company or running Fortune 500 businesses. But it’s still ridiculous to ask two guys to lead a conversation about women in the workplace.It’s also worth noting that while EY has been very outspoken in its efforts to promote and advance women, it’s still struggling to reach equality in its uppermost ranks. Walmart, meanwhile, is not known for its efforts on this issue. A few years ago it fought off a class action suit filed by 1.5 million female employees who accused the company of systematically paying them less than men. They lost their case in a 5-4 decision at the Supreme Court.Fifty-seven percent of Walmart’s U.S. workers are women. But if you look at the people who make the most money, they’re primarily guys. The company’s seniormost leaders are all men, including McMillon and the CEOs who run Walmart International, Walmart U.S., Sam’s Club and Walmart’s e-commerce business."
6,MEDIA,Mike Pence Skipping CNN On Sunday Show Circuit,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mike-pence-cnn-sunday-shows_us_5894bae8e4b09bd304bb14f0,"""State of the Union"" host Jake Tapper last grilled the vice president nearly two months ago.",2017-02-03,"Vice President Mike Pence will be hitting four Sunday shows, but skipping CNN. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5894ecf91900003400e09f0b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Vice President Mike Pence will hit the Sunday show circuit this weekend, with stops on NBC’s “Meet the Press, ABC’s “This Week,” CBS’s “Face the Nation,” and “Fox News Sunday.” But CNN’s “State of the Union” is noticeably missing from what would otherwise be a “full Ginsberg,” a term for when a newsmaker appears on all five major public affairs programs. A White House spokesman told The Huffington Post the administration “offered multiple guests for State of the Union and they declined.”But Pence wasn’t one of them, according to a CNN spokeswoman. Instead, the White House offered presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway, CNN said. The network declined that offer. The Trump White House has notoriously bad relations with CNN already. And the decision to make Pence available to CNN’s Sunday show rivals, but not CNN itself, is likely an extension of what Politico recently reported as a “freezing out” of the network. The White House hasn’t provided any administration officials for “State of the Union” since Jan. 8, an absence the show’s host, Jake Tapper, has noted on the air. The freeze doesn’t appear solid. On Wednesday, Sebastian Gorka, a former Breitbart News editor who’s now deputy assistant to the president, appeared on Tapper’s weekday afternoon show, “The Lead.” And the White House offer of Conway as a substitute guest shows CNN is no longer getting shunned on Sunday mornings. But Pence’s unavailability suggests the animus remains. Tapper last sat down with Pence on Dec. 6 on “The Lead,” an interview in which the CNN host repeatedly pressed the vice president about why Trump’s transition team had sought security clearance for Michael G. Flynn, the son of national security adviser Michael T. Flynn. The younger Flynn, who had served as a top aide to his father, had sparked controversy at the time by helping to fuel the bogus “pizzagate” conspiracy theory. A day before his interview with Pence, Tapper had privately tried to get Flynn Jr. to stop lending credence to the baseless story on Twitter. On “The Lead,” Tapper said Pence was “downplaying” Flynn Jr.’s role in the transition and questioned the decision to seek a security clearance for him. “I want to move on to other issues, but I’m afraid I just didn’t get an answer, which is: Were you aware that the transition had put in for a security clearance for Michael Flynn, Jr.?” Tapper asked. Tapper again pressed the issue. “I’m sorry, it’s just that you’re not answering the question, which is: Were you aware that the transition team had put in for a security clearance?” he asked.Since then, CNN has grown as a target of Trump’s routine attacks on the media. At a Jan. 11 news conference, Trump refused to take a question from CNN correspondent Jim Acosta, a day after the network reported that top U.S. intelligence officials had briefed the then-president elect on an unverified dossier claiming he’d been compromised by Russian intelligence. Trump called CNN ― which did not publish the contents of the 35-page dossier ― “fake news,” along with BuzzFeed, which did publish it. Trump has continued calling CNN “fake news,” including at a Wednesday event honoring Black History Month.On Friday morning, Tapper tweeted that CNN hasn’t been hurt by Trump’s attacks. "
7,POLITICS,MTV News Staff Announces Plan To Unionize,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mtv-news-to-unionize_us_5893d8a5e4b09bd304ba9464,"Staffers opted to join the Writers Guild of America, East.",2017-02-03,"MTV News staff announced its plans to unionize with the Writers Guild of America, East on Friday, Feb. 3, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5893dfda1900003400e09c2f.jpeg?cache=BqdF6zEJoO&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The majority of digital staff of MTV News has opted to unionize, leaders of the organizing drive said Friday, joining a growing roster of digital publications that have unionized in the past two years.“There has never been a more critically important time in our lives to have the protections of a union, especially for those of us in media,” the MTV News union organizing committee said in a statement announcing majority support. The statement was also an homage to the MTV brand, waxing nostalgic about childhoods spent watching “The Real World” and “Total Request Live.”“There’s never been a more necessary time for MTV News to talk about music, pop culture, and politics with the teenagers of America,” the statement said.More than 80 percent of MTV News’ approximately 50 eligible writers, reporters, producers and social media professionals signed cards electing the Writers Guild of America, East, as their representative in collective bargaining, according to culture writer Teo Bugbee, a member of the organizing committee.MTV and its parent company, Viacom, will now decide whether to recognize the union voluntarily and begin collective bargaining talks, or demand a secret-ballot union election. Companies that request an election sometimes take advantage of the delay to hold closed-door meetings with staff trying to dissuade them from joining.Staff demands include access to “adequate” health care and benefits, a role in crafting editorial policy, an “equitable and transparent compensation” policy, and a “fair” severance package, the organizing committee said in its statement. Health insurance for all staff is a particularly important demand, since the majority of workers are full-time freelancers without access to such coverage and other benefits. Staff members also are seeking legal protection for the era of President Donald Trump, according to the statement.Bugbee emphasized that she and her colleagues are happy with their jobs and are merely looking to make them “better.”“It’s relatively rare to encounter a situation in which what is morally right is also what is practically expedient, and I think we’ve found ourselves in that situation,” Bugbee said. “That’s one of the foundational reasons we’ve moved forward with this union.” Viacom launched an effort to rebrand MTV News for the digital era with major hiring and investment beginning in the fall of 2015. Many employees participating in the union drive have joined the site in the past year.Since June 2015, over half a dozen digital media outfits have unionized, including the group of sites formerly known as Gawker Media, Vice Media, Salon, ThinkProgress, The Guardian U.S., and Law 360. The Huffington Post, the largest such workplace to unionize, on Monday ratified its first collective bargaining contract under the representation of the Writers Guild of America, East."

Solange’s nomination in new artist category is a bit eyebrow-raising, considering she’s had a music career for the past fourteen years. But more interesting than all that: Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez, and The Weeknd are each nominated for an award too. Could this mean Bieber will end up in the same room as Selena and her new man? That would be quite the reunion. Regardless, be sure to vote on your favorites before the show premieres on March 11.And by the way, here are some of the other nominees this year:Favorite TV Show – Kids’ Show"

World Hijab Day started in 2013 in response to discrimination against Muslim women who wear the hijab. The event celebrates religious freedom and Muslim women’s right to wear a head covering.The intention behind the tradition is to give non-Muslims and non-hijab-wearing Muslim women an opportunity to experience the hijab for a day, said founder Nazma Khan on the World Hijab Day website.Not all Muslim women agree that such solidarity actions are effective in combating bias. Some argue that the media’s focus on the hijab only serves to further marginalize Muslim women, many of whom take issue with the hijab’s complicated social and political history.But for many Muslim women, National Hijab Day offers a chance to celebrate the religious freedoms enshrined in the U.S. Constitution ― especially at a time when it seems some of the country’s leaders have lost sight of them.Olympic fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad tweeted her support of the event on Wednesday, ending her comments with hashtag the “#resist.”Scroll down to see photos from World Hijab Day in New York City:"

The United Nations said this week that 5 million Somalis are facing food insecurity because of an ongoing drought.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58919b951b0000260004db22.jpeg?cache=8yaJG6bAUK&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"More than two decades of civil war alongside recurring drought has compounded an already-dire food security crisis for Somalians. And as the country and larger region face water shortages once again, U.S. President Donald Trump’s refugee and travel restrictions are leaving its people with even fewer options for escape.On Friday, Trump signed an executive order that, among other things, suspends refugee admissions to the U.S. from all countries for four months and restricts travel from seven countries ― Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen ― for 90 days.Just a few days later, the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization announced that, after months of lower-than-average rainfall, more than 17 million people are in “crisis and emergency food insecurity levels” in several east African nations, including Somalia and Sudan.Two million Somalis are currently seeking refuge outside their homeland, making it the world’s third-largest source country for refugees ― behind only Syria and Afghanistan. According to USA Today, nearly 15,000 Somali refugees who had planned to resettle in the U.S. are currently stranded in Kenya’s Dadaab, the world’s largest refugee camp, after Trump’s immigration order went into effect.More than 130 Somali refugees had already been approved to enter the U.S. and had been poised to leave the camp when Trump’s directive was announced. The administration said Tuesday that it would admit 872 pre-approved refugees into the U.S. this week, but it’s unclear whether these people are part of that group.In Somalia, 5 million people, or about 40 percent of the population, are facing hunger because of both drought and fighting between the Islamist militant group al-Shabaab and Somalia’s African Union-backed government. More than 300,000 children under the age of 5 are acutely malnourishedIn recent years, drought has become a frequent visitor to east Africa. In 2011, a devastating drought, said to be the worst in the region in 60 years, threatened the livelihoods of almost 10 million people. Almost 260,000 died of starvation in Somalia alone — half of them were children under the age of 5.Last year, drought devastated the region again. Exacerbated by one of the strongest El Nino events ever recorded, the dry spell left millions facing hunger across southern and eastern Africa.“We don’t have food, water, and clothes,” Quresha Abdi Ali, a displaced Somali woman, told Africa News this week. “Our farms are barren, our livestock are dead, and our men cannot find any work to do. I lost my son because I couldn’t find any food or water to give him … I also lost 12 members of my family. We are in so much despair.”The FAO warned that an “immediate and sufficient” humanitarian response is needed to prevent the current drought crisis from “becoming a catastrophe.”“This is, above all, a livelihoods and humanitarian emergency — and the time to act is now. We cannot wait for a disaster like the famine in 2011,” FAO Deputy Director-General, Climate and Natural Resources, Maria Helena Semedo, told a high-level panel during the African Union Summit, which kicked off in Addis-Ababa, Ethiopia, on Monday.An FAO spokesperson, speaking from Kenya, told HuffPost on Thursday that this drought crisis could be as devastating for Somalia as the 2011 disaster. “Famine is a real possibility in 2017” for the country, which is forecasted to experience lower-than-average rainfall this year, the spokesperson said.Climate change has been linked to the increase in severity and frequency of drought in the Horn of Africa, which in turn threatens food security for millions of people. Peter deMenocal, Columbia University’s dean of science who co-authored a study in 2015 on this topic, said this week that there is an “accelerating trend toward even greater aridity” in the region due to carbon emissions.Suleimn Yussuf Muhumed, 24, is one of the Somali refugees in Dadaab who had been on the verge of coming to the U.S. He had fled Somalia with his father and younger sister after armed men killed three of his siblings. Drought later ruined a small plot of land the family owned.Muhumed told USA Today that life in the refugee camp is “filled with difficulties,” and he had been looking forward to his new life in Ohio. He said he’d heard Ohio “is a very cool place, a very nice place for life, and the people are very welcoming.”Sudan, another country affected by the drought and the ban, had just signed a deal with the Obama administration in January to lift a 20-year-old U.S. trade embargo.“We feel sorry that the decision was taken at a time we started cooperating and the sanctions were lifted,” Sudan’s Foreign Minister Ibrahim Ghandour told reporters during the African Union Summit earlier this week. Also speaking at the summit, chair of the African Union Commission and South African politician Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma had strong words for Trump.“The very country to which many of our people were taken as slaves during the trans-Atlantic slave trade has now decided to ban refugees from some of our countries,” Dlamini-Zuma said on Monday, addressing the union’s 54 member states.“What do we do about this? Indeed, this is one of the greatest challenges to our unity and solidarity,” she continued.______Dominique Mosbergen is a reporter at The Huffington Post covering climate change, extreme weather and extinction.

Stat. Their outraged reaction became a viral photo.On Jan. 31, a picture of a doctor holding a sign that reads, “I am taking care of your mom … but I can’t go see mine,” was posted to Twitter by Khaled Beydoun.The photo has received over 21,000 likes and 11,000 retweets — including a retweet by J.K.

When he got to the airport in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, on Saturday, he initially thought everything was fine. He got a boarding pass, made it through an immigration checkpoint and was waiting at his gate when he heard his name being called over a loudspeaker. “When I got to the counter, they said there was a notice from Customs and Border Protection that ... they had to offload us from the flight.” Fadlalla told the Los Angeles Times. “I was shocked.”He waited at the airport for four hours before returning to his family’s home in Sudan.After Fadlalla’s colleagues heard the news, doctors at Interfaith Medical Center and members of the Committee of Interns and Residents union held signs at the hospital in support of his return, a spokesperson at CIR told The Huffington Post.They posted pictures of themselves holding their signs on social media sites.The signs’ messages include:“Kamal belongs in Brooklyn,” “Bring Kamal back” and “Immigrants keep hospitals running.”One of the doctors who participated in the show of support was Dr. Mazin Khalid, who holds the sign in the viral photo.Khalid went to medical school in Sudan with Fadlalla, and the two are friends, CIR told HuffPost.Yet, Khalid didn’t even write the sign featured in the viral photo, per CIR. It was another doctor, Dr. Sumit Dahal, who got camera shy and asked Khalid to hold the sign for him in the photograph.Yet, this doesn’t mean that Khalid doesn’t also hold strong convictions about what happened to his friend and colleague.“The executive order basically bans entry even for those already established and who have been vetted and practicing medicine for years,” Khalid said in a Facebook post. “I know that if I leave the country I won’t be allowed back in, and that my family can’t visit me anymore. I just hope that nothing happens to my family and I wish that I would be able to see them soon.”Khalid added: “For the time being I will continue to work among my Muslim, Christian, Jewish, Hindu, Sikh, atheist friends who are my family here, who are concerned about our banned colleague and are praying for him day and night.

17,THE WORLDPOST,Romanian Government To 'Press Ahead' Despite Massive Anti-Corruption Protests,Jesselyn Cook,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/romania-corruption-law-protests_us_58937573e4b05c775abe6cb5,"A new law decriminalizing official misconduct has triggered nationwide outrage, but the ruling party isn't listening.",2017-02-02,"People protest corruption in front of government headquarters in Bucharest, Romania, on Feb. 1, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5893a36f1900003400e09b21.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"The Romanian government adopted an emergency law this week to decriminalize official misconduct, dealing a major setback to the country’s ongoing fight against corruption and sparking the largest nationwide protests since the fall of communism in 1989.Prime Minister Sorin Grindeanu issued the decree, which decriminalizes graft offenses that result in less than 200,000 lei (about $48,000) in financial damage, on Tuesday. The new measure could free dozens of officials jailed for abuse of power and halt current corruption-related investigations, including the trial of Social Democratic Party leader Liviu Dragnea. Grindeanu is also a member of Dragnea’s party, known as the PSD.Calls for Grindeanu’s immediate resignation grew louder after he decreed the new law, but the prime minister has defended it and vowed to “press ahead.”The center-left PSD retook power in late December, just over a year after former party leader Victor Ponta resigned amid corruption and plagiarism allegations. The PSD says the decree is necessary to reduce overcrowding in prisons.Thousands of Romanians disagree. On Wednesday, at least 150,000 protestors filled Bucharest’s Victory Square, chanting “Resign!” and “Thieves!” Police fired tear gas and arrested about 20 demonstrators.

They suggest that U.S. foreign policy under Trump will be unpredictable, and that when the president feels challenged, there are international repercussions.Trump’s most unexpected fight so far came during his call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Saturday. Trump apparently became irate when Turnbull attempted to confirm that the U.S. would uphold an Obama-era agreement for the U.S. to take in up to 1,250 refugees from an Australian detention center, according to a report by The Washington Post. Turnbull allegedly hit a nerve and Trump reportedly flew off the handle, accusing Australia of trying to export the “next Boston bombers.” Trump and Turnbull then entered into a heated exchange that Trump told the Australian prime minister was the “worst call by far” he’d had with world leaders. According to the Post, Trump hung up 20 minutes into what should have been an hour-long chat. He tweeted out a statement on Wednesday referring to the refugees as “illegal immigrants,” and calling the agreement a “dumb deal.”Australia and the U.S., close and longtime allies, now face a diplomatic dispute over the refugee agreement. On Thursday, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) tried to mend some of the damage by calling Australia’s ambassador to the U.S., Joe Hockey, to reaffirm the two countries’ alliance. The fate of the refugees, who are living in harsh conditions in island detention camps, is unclear. Trump also had a testy diplomatic call with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto last Friday, according to an explosive Associated Press report published on Wednesday. During an hour-long phone conversation with the Mexican leader, Trump reportedly said he was ready to send U.S. troops to stop “bad hombres down there” if the Mexican military didn’t step up. The AP said it had based its report on an excerpt of a transcript of the call that didn’t include information about Trump’s tone or Peña Nieto’s response.According to an excerpt of the transcript of the call provided to CNN, Trump said, “You have some pretty tough hombres in Mexico that you may need help with. We are willing to help with that big-league, but they have [to] be knocked out and you have not done a good job knocking them out.” Mexico denied the report, insisting that the conversation between both leaders was respectful and constructive. Relations between the U.S. and Mexico have been particularly rocky in the past week. Last Wednesday, Trump ordered the construction of a wall on the U.S.’ southwest border and tweeted that Mexico would foot the bill, a promise he made throughout his presidential campaign (and one that Mexican leaders have repeatedly derided). Peña Nieto canceled a planned visit to Washington D.C. over Trump’s remarks, while Trump insisted on Twitter that both leaders had mutually agreed on the cancellation.Finally, Trump’s national security adviser, Michael Flynn, took aim at Iran on Wednesday, putting Tehran “on notice” over a ballistic missile test it conducted over the weekend. The president echoed the threat on his Twitter account on Thursday. “Iran has been formally PUT ON NOTICE for firing a ballistic missile. Should have been thankful for the terrible deal the U.S. made with them!” Trump tweeted. Flynn’s statement did not include details about any steps the administration is considering. A Pentagon spokesperson said on Wednesday that the U.S. military did not change its posture toward Iran. Iran did not waste time in hitting back. It wasn’t the first time “an inexperienced person” has threatened Iran, Ali Akbar Velayati, an adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, said on Thursday. “The American government will understand that threatening Iran is useless,” Velayati added, according to Fars News. Trump has routinely vowed to take a hard line on Iran and described the multilateral agreement to limit the country’s nuclear abilities as “the worst deal ever.”Despite the fiery statements and revelations, Trump’s White House team has reported on numerous “constructive” communications with foreign leaders ― and Trump himself has tried to downplay the reports of his more negative interactions with foreign governments.“When you hear about the tough phone calls I’m having, don’t worry about it.

However, a less-heralded, Off-Off-Broadway play will break fresh ground as an exploration of queer life under President Donald Trump. “Boys of a Certain Age,” which opens Feb. 8 at New York’s Theaterlab, follows four gay Jewish men who are bound by identity and family, but nonetheless struggle to find a common ground. Directed by Dan Dinero, the play begins with a familiar conceit: a middle-aged gay man, Ira (played by R. Scott Williams), is hosting a weekend gathering at his beach home outside New York. On the guest list are childhood pal Larry (Joseph J. Menino) and son Bryan (Marc Sinoway), as well as a conservative nephew, Christopher (Brian Gilgor), who happens to be an ardent Trump supporter. Needless to say, what was intended as a retreat ends up being a comedic collision of personalities and politics, compounded by the fact that Ira and Larry used to be lovers. Watch Fingerman talk about his play below, then scroll down to keep reading. When “Boys of a Certain Age” premiered at the 2016 Fresh Fruit Festival last July, the prospects of Trump stepping foot into the White House seemed doubtful. In order to reflect a new and indeterminate reality for the LGBTQ community, playwright Dan Fingerman told The Huffington Post that he’s shifted the timeline of the piece to February 2017, just weeks after Trump’s inauguration. Even though the time period was changed, Dinero opted to keep its seaside setting intact. “We found that this idea of a beach in winter – stark, desolate, a bit ‘end of the world’ in feeling – somehow feels exactly right for where we, as a country, are right now,” Dinero, who also directed Fingerman’s previous play, “The Austerity of Hope,” said. “I hope this doesn’t sound callous, [but] if fascist regimes are a bitch to live in, their inherent conflict and uncertainty makes great fodder for dramatic conflict.” But both Dinero and Fingerman felt that “Boys of a Certain Age” should avoid an overtly partisan message. To that point, the gay Republican character “isn’t a villain, a capitalist pig, or an ignorant rube” but rather “someone who cares deeply for the world he lives in,” Dinero said. At its 2016 premiere, the show drew viewers from both sides of the political spectrum and, according to Fingerman, “both related to something and enjoyed it.” Although the political climate in the U.S. has arguably become even more divided since the election, Fingerman hopes those who see “Boys of a Certain Age” in its revised incarnation will appreciate the multiple perspectives the show presents. “I think it’s very important in this time of great uncertainty about our future to keep proudly telling gay stories,” he told HuffPost. “Even though there’s a lot of despair and hopelessness in our world, we’re not alone, we’re in this together, and any attempts to roll back our rights as gay people, or more broadly Americans are not going to go unnoticed.

26,TECH,This Anti-Bullying App Helps You Brighten Someone's Day In Seconds,Hayley Miller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/anti-bullying-app-brighten_us_58853303e4b070d8cad367e7,Because we could all use some good vibes right about now. 😊,2017-02-02,Lauren Naselli's third grade students wrote thank you notes to the Brighten staff on homemade iPhones.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/588f7ea917000026002d93ef.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Austin Kevitch was in high school when he first came up with the idea for an app that would allow users to send compliments to each other anonymously. But it wasn’t until tragedy struck years later that he decided to turn that idea into reality. Kevitch was studying abroad in South Africa when his friend, Oliver Pacchiana, died in a rock climbing accident. Soon after, positive and loving messages flooded Pacchiana’s Facebook wall. The tributes moved Kevitch deeply, and he imagined how much they would have meant to his friend if he’d received them while he was alive.“Just hearing one of those comments could change your life,” said Kevitch, now 25 and the CEO of the app Brighten. “I learned a lot about him just from what people were sharing. It was a wake-up call that the world needs something like [Brighten].”Today, Kevitch runs Brighten out of Santa Monica, California, with a six-person staff. The app, downloaded over 1 million times since its 2015 release, allows users to send out anonymous compliments called “brightens,” although Kevitch says most people choose to identify themselves. Users can also send a snapshot of their smile to the person who complimented them. Social media can be a minefield of anxiety for many, so Kevitch has made it his mission to create a space that’s focused on spreading positivity.“It’s all about establishing a positive culture,” he said. “No one is inherently bad. People just have bad days and project that negativity onto someone else.” The positivity is now spreading through communities and classrooms, with many educators embracing the app as an anti-bullying tool.Lauren Naselli, a third-grade teacher in in Bridgewater, New Jersey, began using Brighten with co-teacher Courtney Rothkugel last year, after their principal encouraged them to test it out with students.Since the school uses Chromebooks, students couldn’t work with the actual app (Brighten is currently available only to iOS users), but Naselli came up with a low-tech way to teach the concept.Each day, a different group of students received pieces of paper with hand-drawn iPhones on them. The students would write their own “brightens” on the papers and hand them out to different students each day.“They loved it,” Naselli said. “It created a warm and comfortable environment. ... Our class really lifted each other up and supported one another.”She reached out to Brighten to see if there was a version of the app she could use in her classroom. Kevitch said his team was so touched by her story that they sent Naselli’s students free Brighten t-shirts. An Android version of the app is currently in the works. Naselli said she’s “super sensitive” to bullying and was pleased to see how the Brighten-inspired activity created class unity. “There are people with good hearts everywhere,” she said. “And I think this app can help bring that out.” Tim Cannon, who has been friends with Kevitch since high school, left his corporate job in Chicago to lead Brighten’s community outreach program. He now works with more than 1,000 high school and college students who volunteer to promote the app on their campuses. “To know that I’ve at least given it my all to put something good out in the world ― I wake up every day feeling grateful and appreciative and happy,” he said.Brighten recently partnered with the gun violence prevention organization Sandy Hook Promise for “Start With Hello Week,” a weeklong effort to fight social isolation. Students in more than 1,700 schools will be introduced to the app. More than 20 percent of students ages 12 to 18 report being bullied, according to a 2015 survey conducted by the Department of Education.Anti-bullying expert Dr. Malcolm Smith is optimistic about Brighten’s “power to use social media to do good,” though he is hesitant to embrace the app’s anonymity feature as a way to combat cyberbullying.“Anytime a child can say something positive to someone ― even if it’s someone they don’t know ― it causes a very positive brain interaction,” Smith said of the app. “But it’s so much better for a person’s soul to give compliments in person.”First lady Melania Trump announced her desire to tackle online bullying in November. Though President Donald Trump frequently engages in cyberbullying on Twitter, Kevitch said he would gladly partner with the White House if it would spark positive change in society at large. “I think it’s going to benefit the current generation of high schoolers,” Kevitch said. “Melania, if you’re reading this, text me. Send me a Brighten compliment.”"

But none have been quite as cool as this clothing collection by designer Joe Freshgoods, which launched on January 20. If you, like us, missed the first release of “Thank You Obama,” a collection of T-shirts, posters and sweatshirts all dedicated to the Obama family, all of that changed when Chance the Rapper tweeted photos of himself wearing the restocked goods on Thursday. “I’m a model now. #ThankUObama droppin in like 15 minutes. ThankUObama.us,” he captioned the group of images. He’s seen wearing a T-shirt featuring Obama in a crown, an airbrushed “Barack and Michelle wedding T-shirt” that looks like it came from the coolest amusement part of all time and oh, right ...A T-shirt that has the name Malia emblazoned across it. Said T-shirt, called “a message to Malia,” also says, “We all smoke, it’s OK.” The design and color appear to be an homage to Harvard, where Malia will study after a gap year.On the Thank You Obama website, Freshgoods explained the inspiration for this extremely important project. “The night Obama won his first term gave me so much hope, especially and most importantly as a black man. I decided to make a collection saying ‘thank you’ and give me something to smile at every now and then when i look in the closet,” he wrote. According to Casual Fridays, the line sold out quickly when it first dropped, and this restock is already on a 1- to 2-week backorder, so you’d better move fast if you want to score some of this iconic memorabilia.

28,POLITICS,Donald Trump Thinks He Can Endure More Controversy And Pain Than You,Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-chaos_us_5893ad79e4b0c1284f25105c,"The fear, for Democrats, is that he's absolutely right.",2017-02-02,Donald Trump believes his pain threshold is his key to success.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5893aeec280000200099689b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Just two weeks into his administration, Donald Trump’s presidency is off to a rapid pace. But even by his standards, Monday was especially frenzied.With protests still simmering over the refugee and immigration ban he’d imposed days prior, Trump that morning mocked the Democratic leader of the Senate for shedding what he deemed “fake tears” for those affected by the ban. That piece of mockery alone would have been enough in the past to stir a day’s outrage and news coverage. But it was followed by so much more. There were the rumblings of a constitutional crisis as customs agents reportedly disobeyed court orders to let the detained see lawyers. Trump signed another executive order dramatically curtailing regulations. His White House continued bickering with the press over his top political aide being named to the National Security Council. Jewish groups denounced his refusal to specifically mention Jews in his Holocaust Remembrance Day statement.And then came the night. The acting attorney general announced that she would not defend Trump’s ban on grounds it may be unconstitutional. So Trump fired her, finding a replacement who would do his bidding. Then he fired the director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. And to cap the evening, he let it be known that the next day, he’d be nominating a justice to the Supreme Court. The political universe was left trying to simply catch its breath.“There are so many fires burning in so many different places that there is sensory overload,” said David Axelrod, President Barack Obama’s longtime adviser. “There was a lot of action at the beginning of the Obama administration. But it was focused on dealing with a crisis. This is of a different nature and magnitude. I wouldn’t say an order of magnitude, because order is not necessarily part of it.”It’s often said that the office of the presidency ages the president. But in the era of Trump, the public and Congress are aging as well. His first two weeks have been the equivalent of a political sugar rush, repeated on a daily, sometimes hourly basis. It’s left government officials both invigorated and exhausted. It’s overwhelmed staffers on Capitol Hill. And it’s made Democrats nervous that they’re playing whack-a-mole, chasing the last Trump controversy as a new one inevitably emerges. Some suspect it all may be by design.“We have not seen anything like this,” said Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) “And I’m sure some of the older people who have been here a longer period of time would say that. It’s moving at a very rapid pace. I would hope they would wait until they got their feet under them, to a certain extent, and the ban was one instance of that.”“We know what’s going on,” said Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.). “But I worry that sometime this speed is to make sure the American public doesn’t know what to do.”For Trump’s aides, confidants, and biographers, this has a familiar feel. The Trump they know thrives on drama and chaos. When, during the campaign, he spoke about the importance of stamina and energy, it was meant both as code to mock Hillary Clinton’s health and Jeb Bush’s verve, but also in the strictly literal sense.“It is not about physical stamina. It is about psychological scar tissue,” said Timothy O’Brien, a Trump biographer who was unsuccessfully sued by Trump, and a former top editor at The Huffington Post. “He really is like the Energizer bunny of the political landscape, and people have to recognize that about him because he is formidable in that way. The weakness he has is his vanity. He cares about ratings and cares about center stage. And he needs, always, to be the winner on that center stage.”In the portrait that Trump paints of himself, perseverance is a central theme. His books are littered with boasts of steely resolve, painfully few hours of sleep (a myth, O’Brien suggested), and political and legal hurdles he has overcome. One telling anecdote comes in The Art of the Deal, Trump’s bestselling business book. He describes how his mentor, the bare-knuckled lawyer Roy Cohn, resorted to homophobia to mask his homosexuality. Instead of feeling empathy for Cohn’s psychological torment, Trump was awed at his cold-blooded drive. “Roy never talked about it. He just didn’t like the image. He felt that to the average person, being gay was almost synonymous with being a wimp,” Trump wrote. “That was the last thing he wanted to project, so he almost went overboard to avoid it.”In the spirit of Cohn, Trump believes that toughness ― or, better put, the ability to endure more pain and discomfort than the competition ― is what begets his success, his aides said. It is the best explanation they have for his kinetic, chaotic first days in office. “I could not stop laughing when the mainstream media said, ‘Oh my God, the Mexican president has canceled his visit with Trump,’” said Sam Nunberg, a former Trump aide, in reference to the dust-up in the president’s first week. “I think Trump loved it. If I had to guess, he is negotiating. … The idea that the president of Mexico will affect Trump or scare Trump because he won’t attend a meeting with him at the White House is hilarious. Trump has plenty to do. I don’t think he cares.” On the Hill, Democrats worry that the incredible backlash that Trump has engendered will eventually fade; that the executive order banning certain immigration from Muslim-majority countries will outlast the will to protest it.But others see genuine opportunity. The ACLU, for instance, received an unprecedented amount of donations after Trump signed the order. And Adam Jentleson, a senior strategic adviser leading the anti-Trump campaign at the Center for American Progress, said his organization had been inundated with donations, offers of pro-bono help and leaks from inside the government. “We can do this all day,” Jentleson said. “We are flourishing in this environment.” Already, there is evidence that the public is tiring of Trump’s pace. Forty-seven percent of respondents in a Gallup poll said he was moving too fast, while just 10 percent said not fast enough. Whether Trump has it in him to pump the brakes is another matter entirely. The rigors of the job do seem to be taking a toll. In reports about a seemingly disastrous call Trump held with the Australian prime minister over the weekend, one excuse offered by Trump’s aides was that it had come at the end of a long day of conversations. The call took place around 5 p.m.But there is a difference between an appetite for work and an appetite for controversy. And, as Democrats were left shocked that the president offended a close ally and Republicans scrambled to clean up the mess (Sen. John McCain called the Australian ambassador to patch things over), Trump simply moved on to other matters, meeting with CEOs to talk jobs, provocatively threatening Iran on Twitter, and asking the National Prayer Breakfast to pray for Arnold Schwarzenegger’s ratings on “The Apprentice.”“I think the pace is obviously very fast because of the methodology used by this administration,” McCain told The Huffington Post. “I don’t comment on that methodology. I’ve given up on that long ago.”Want more updates from Sam Stein? Sign up for his newsletter, Spam Stein, here."

University police said that a crowd of roughly 1,500 people had toppled light poles, started fires and hurled objects at officers before the event. Security had been heightened, as students had announced demonstrations against Yiannopoulos. “The violence was instigated by a group of about 150 masked agitators who came onto campus and interrupted an otherwise non-violent protest,” a university statement said. As the violence escalated Wednesday night, police placed the campus on lockdown and advised students to shelter in place, then ordered demonstrators multiple times to leave the area.The university and its police department had placed “dozens of additional police officers” on duty and attempted to use various methods of crowd control, to no avail. “It was simply impossible to maintain order given the level of threat, disruption, and violence,” the administration said in a statement.Yiannopoulos styles himself as a free-speech libertarian, and under that guise peddles provocative commentary saying “rape culture” is a myth and transgender people have mental illnesses. His scheduled visit exposed the difficulty that Berkeley, like colleges across the country, has in balancing its commitment to freedom of expression with diversity and tolerance. The question is more potent for Berkeley, which prides itself upon the student-led Free Speech Movement that began in 1964 with students protesting against university rules that limited political activity on campus. Berkeley Student Sai Dulla, 30, disagreed with the violence, favoring instead peaceful debate and “free speech.”Allie Smith, 22, a Berkeley City College student, said the small numbers who committed vandalism tarnished an otherwise positive experience. As she spoke, a brass band played and a crowd danced.“This is what I came here for ― people who want to be together,” said Smith, who advocated “creating safe spaces rather than meeting hate with hate.”Members of Berkeley College Republicans said the protesters trampled First Amendment rights.“The Free Speech Movement is dead. Today, the Berkeley College Republicans’ constitutional right to free speech was silenced by criminals and thugs seeking to cancel Milo Yiannopoulos’ tour,” the group said in a statement afterward. “Their success is a defeat for civilized society and the free exchange of ideas on college campuses across America.”Students and faculty members demanded the cancellation of the event. In response, Chancellor Nicholas Dirks said last week that it would be unconstitutional to quash it based on anything that Yiannoplous might say. Only the Berkeley College Republicans could call off the talk, he said. “Mr. Yiannopoulos is not the first of his ilk to speak at Berkeley and he will not be the last,” Dirks’ statement said. “In our view, Mr. Yiannopoulos is a troll and provocateur who uses odious behavior in part to ‘entertain,’ but also to deflect any serious engagement with ideas.”Yiannopoulos was permanently banned from Twitter after inciting racist and misogynistic bullying of “Ghostbusters” star Leslie Jones. He gained thousands of followers on social media as an anti-feminist during the Gamergate controversy, when male video game players targeted female game developers for harassment. Yiannopoulos’ writing arguably emboldened the subculture of gamers who complained there was a feminist conspiracy to make their pastime more politically correct. Critics from Berkeley’s faculty and students said Yiannopoulos lacks any intellectual argument worthy of an academic setting and that his tendency for harassment, such as his role trolling Jones, is not a meaningful way of exercising free speech.“While the First Amendment protects him, he intentionally baits marginalized voices so that he can bully them and exploit the angry backlash in front of his fans,” an editorial in the Daily Californian student newspaper said. “In inviting him, [the student Republicans club] demonstrates it is not a club dedicated to the preservation of free speech and open dialogue on campus. This is a club hiding behind the right of free speech as an excuse to legitimize — and even laugh at — hate speech and shirk responsibility for any resulting damage.”Controversy and mayhem have followed Yiannopoulos on his college tour this winter. One man was shot in the abdomen at a protest outside of Yiannopoulos’ event at the University of Washington on Jan. 20. A College Republicans club at the University of California, Davis canceled his appearance with “Pharma Bro” Martin Shkreli after protesters blocked access to the venue on Jan. 14.

31,POLITICS,Republicans Find It Inconceivable Trump Nominees May Lie To Them,Michael McAuliff,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-trump-nominees-truth-lies_us_587fad94e4b0cf0ae881692c,Even in the post-filibuster world where they're the only people that need to be convinced -- and after two nominees have been caught in falsehoods.,2017-02-02,"Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), left, is welcomed by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) prior to testifying before a confirmation hearing on his nomination to be Health and Human Services secretary on Jan. 24.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5892a76328000020009965b4.jpeg?cache=PnoVnyDsIa&ops=crop_36_131_3046_1124%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― A day after President Donald Trump delivered yet another denunciation of NATO, calling it obsolete and putting himself at odds with most of the GOP, Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) sat down with Trump’s nominee for secretary of state, former Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson.Did Tillerson, the man who was confirmed by the Senate on Wednesday to carry out Trump’s foreign policy, believe that NATO was obsolete, Durbin asked him.Tillerson, who had publicly disagreed repeatedly with his would-be boss during his confirmation hearing, came down in line not with Trump, but with the rest of the GOP, saying NATO was not obsolete. What Trump really meant, he explained, was that the venerable alliance needed to be made stronger.“I hope that’s true. It doesn’t sound like a consistent interpretation, but I hope that what Mr. Tillerson said was true,” Durbin said after the meeting in his office last month.But since Democrats eliminated the filibuster on all nominations except for the Supreme Court in 2013, nominees no longer need to worry very much about the minority party or its senators’ opinions. They only need to satisfy the party in power.Normally, that shouldn’t be a problem for a Republican president’s picks in a Republican-run Senate. As long as nominees reflect the opinions of their party’s leader, all is well. But Trump is not normal. His views on the world often differ from those of mainstream Republicans, diverging on a gamut of topics such as NATO, Russia, the intelligence community, free trade and the acceptability of torture, to name a few.Yet, like Tillerson, numerous nominees have been asserting positions contrary to the president’s time and again, lining up more with GOP orthodoxy. It raises a conundrum: How do lawmakers know if nominees are telling the truth, or just telling Republicans what they want to hear? “I don’t know the answer to that,” Durbin said.“Many of [President] Trump’s statements and tweets are irrational and irresponsible. And if his nominees for these Cabinet positions came and repeated them as the policy of the United States of America, their chances of winning even Republican votes are in doubt,” Durbin said. “So they’ll come in and publicly disagree.”The issue would seem to pose a difficult problem for Republicans who don’t want to hamstring their new administration, but also presumably would like to be sure they are getting a government that aligns with their values and won’t embarrass them come the next election.Nevertheless, no Republican asked by The Huffington Post over the last couple of weeks expressed the least bit of doubt about the sincerity of Trump’s nominees or whether their disagreements with their boss might be purely strategic. “No,” said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who has been notably cool toward Trump. “I trust them. When you trust people, you take them at their word.”“No. I think the nominees are answering the questions fully from their perspectives,” said Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho). “I think they’re telling us what they believe.”“No. These are big-time people. They know they’ve got to be truthful,” said Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah). “Listen, I work them over pretty hard when they come into my office. They know they’ve got to tell the truth to me.”But it is more than a theoretical question. In the past week, two secretary nominees ― Steve Mnuchin for the Treasury Department and Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.) for the Department of Health and Human Services ― were caught saying things that were not true.Mnuchin said his former bank’s aggressive foreclosure efforts did not include robo-signing, one of the practices that sparked the mortgage meltdown in 2007 and 2008. But his OneWest Bank used the mechanism extensively. Price said that he paid the same for a stock as anyone else, when really the $50,000 to $100,000 he invested was part of an insider deal only available to a few.Angry Democrats blocked the two appointees’ votes Tuesday before the Finance Committee, which Hatch chairs, by boycotting the proceeding.Hatch was incensed and suspended committee rules on Wednesday to advance the nominations to the Senate floor anyway.He said he saw no attempts to deceive ― except maybe by Democrats, who he said were just out to derail the Trump administration.“These two candidates are about as honest and decent as you can be,” Hatch said, with particular contempt for the worries that Price’s activities, involving a company that benefited from his legislation, amount to insider trading.“Oh, come on. They found $300,” Hatch said, although he misstated the amount of the investment. “He invested $300 in this company, and it’s probably not going to be profitable. I mean, that’s bush-league crap. It really is.”“You could find something wrong with everybody’s finances if you want to. The question is, is it substantially important? Is it something that indicates they lied? Is it something that is justifiably serious enough to stop their nominations? If it was, I would have stopped it,” he continued. “I don’t even know if it was true.”In that, he’s in a spot not too dissimilar from Durbin, although Mnuchin’s and Price’s statements are clearly untrue to people who have checked, and Durbin can only guess at the truthfulness of Tillerson’s words.“So where does that leave us?” Durbin asked rhetorically, musing over the possibility that Trump’s Cabinet choices are just saying what they need to say.He was not sure, but he suggested the answers matter more in a Trump presidency than they usually do amid the typical partisan gamesmanship that accompanies nominations and new administrations.“We don’t know what President Trump is going to do, whether he is going to insist on his irrational and unreasonable positions, or whether he’s going to listen to these cooler heads and more experienced people and come up with a more reasonable approach,” Durbin said. “All we can hope is that those who do make it through the confirmation process have the strength to confront him and those in his administration who harbor these ridiculous positions.”If Republicans feel the same way, they’re not saying so. One, Sen. Pat Roberts (Kan.), allowed that there could be a downside if nominees are freed from the need to please at least some members of the other party, but he still cast it in the familiar partisan fashion.“Well, there’s always a downside,” Roberts said. “But [Democrats] have got to cooperate first. They’ve been AWOL.”How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you? Sign up for our weekly newsletter and get breaking updates on Trump’s presidency by messaging us here.

32,POLITICS,Some Democrats Worry A Vicious Fight Over Supreme Court Seat Could Further Damage The Senate,Laura Barrón-López,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senate-democrats-supreme-court-neil-gorsuch_us_589369a3e4b06f344e4067ba,"“It is, of course, only human to want some revenge.""",2017-02-02,"Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), pictured at right, warned that a battle over President Donald Trump's Supreme Court pick could further harm the already deeply divided Senate.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58936de71900003400e09a5a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Senate Democrats have about a month to figure out what they want to do about Neil Gorsuch, President Donald Trump’s pick to fill the Supreme Court seat left vacant by the late Justice Antonin Scalia.Right now, they’re being pulled in different directions: On one end is a base calling out for absolute obstruction, and on the other are moderates who fear that picking this fight could ruin their ability to stop Trump at a more critical juncture in his presidency. If Democrats filibuster Gorsuch, it’s likely Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) will invoke the nuclear option ― disrupting the rules of the Senate in order to push through Trump’s nominee with only 50 votes. That opens the door for McConnell to make a few other rule changes and further hurt the Democratic minority. Almost immediately after Trump announced Gorsuch as his pick, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Democrats would hold the nominee to the 60-vote threshold needed to clear a filibuster. But it’s unclear if Democrats will stay united and vote in bloc against Gorsuch. “Those who say at the end of this process there are only two possible results — that the Senate will confirm this nominee or the Republicans will use the nuclear option to change the rules of the Senate — are dead wrong,” Schumer said Wednesday on the Senate floor. “That is a false choice.” But Schumer’s game theory relies on McConnell sending Gorsuch back to the White House and not using the procedural weapon he has handy. The Republican leader has said repeatedly in the past 24 hours that “Gorsuch will be confirmed,” apparently betting that Trump’s nominee will somehow clear the 60 votes needed ― meaning at least eight Democrats will vote to confirm him. Many Senate Democrats were still processing the pick in the hours after Trump’s announcement, but the divisions were already starting to show. Liberals want Gorsuch denied the seat; moderates want the process to work its will and warn that a bitter fight ending in rules being changed could damage the institution and further widen the already gaping chasm between the two parties.Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) said he wants Gorsuch to get what former President Barack Obama’s nominee, Merrick Garland, never did: a hearing, a committee vote and a floor vote. He wouldn’t say how he plans to vote, but voiced concern over the possibility that McConnell will use the nuclear option.“I think it’s premature to come out and say I oppose this nominee,” Coons said, adding that the current political atmosphere makes him wonder if Republicans and Democrats will ever find a way to work together again.“If all we do is continue to exact a pound of flesh from each other, we will eventually strip our republic bare to the bone,” Coons said when asked why Democrats should be reasonable after Republicans blocked Obama’s nominee for 11 months. “It is, of course, only human to want some revenge for this unprecedented theft of a vacant [justice] seat,” he said. “Our challenge is to not act in a petty way but to try and act in a more balanced and constructive way because this institution is so important. To further deconstruct it puts all of us at risk.”  The Huffington Post talked to about a dozen Democrats on Wednesday, who all said Gorsuch should be held to the 60-vote threshold. But they were split over whether the nominee should be blocked as revenge for what Republicans did to Garland.“It was horrific the way they handled Merrick Garland,” moderate Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin (W.Va.) said. “I’m going to meet with Gorsuch and I will have a lot of questions to ask and we’ll see how it goes.”As for his colleagues who have announced opposition to Gorsuch without meeting the nominee, Manchin said, “they have a right to do what they want to.”“I know they’re still fuming over what happened and how it was handled, but two wrongs don’t make a right,” he added. “I like to think we’re bigger than that.”Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said she has been inundated with more than 50,000 phone calls from constituents about Trump’s nominees and agenda, but that she plans to give Gorsuch a chance to explain his record.“I really believe in the process, particularly for the Supreme Court,” she said, adding that she hopes McConnell doesn’t resort to the nuclear option because it “would change the whole dynamic of the court.” Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), along with Manchin and Feinstein, is a likely target for Republicans as they try to corral votes in Gorsuch’s favor. “I have to do my due diligence on him,” Tester said.  Then there are the Democrats who want to make Republicans pay for what they did last year. Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) said he isn’t counting votes among fellow Democrats against Gorsuch, but knows that many consider this a “stolen” seat.“If the seat is filled in this manner, it’s going to undermine the integrity of the court, the legitimacy of the court for decades to come,” Merkley said. “I said the only nominee I could support was Merrick Garland because that way we could heal this assault that has occurred on our Constitution.”Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) also plans to vote against Gorsuch, but didn’t want to discuss the possibility that McConnell could change the rules of the Senate, or that that could affect the upper chamber.“I think that he has an obligation to show a breadth of support to get 60 votes ― period,” Brown said. “Whatever happens after that, we’ll see.” But there’s no denying the uneasiness among Democrats as they chart the path ahead. Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) wouldn’t say how she plans to vote, but is “concerned about the rules.”“No question it’s important for the future of the Senate,” she said of preserving the filibuster. “That’s how we get people to work together.” "

34,SPORTS,"This Season, The NFL Got Political. Roger Goodell Is Still Trying To Pretend It's Not.",Travis Waldron,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/roger-goodell-nfl-politics_us_58938b6de4b09bd304ba3812,"After a season defined by players' political stances, the NFL commissioner refused to talk politics before the Super Bowl.",2017-02-02,Colin Kaepernick (7) and teammates Eli Harold and Eric Reid kneeled during the national anthem before a game in October.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5893945a2800001f00996821.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The 2016-2017 season was perhaps among the most openly political years in NFL history, as Colin Kaepernick’s protest of the national anthem, Tom Brady’s tacit support for Donald Trump, players’ reactions to Trump’s victory, and even the election’s potential effects on the NFL ratings dominated headlines.But during the final week of such a tumultuous season, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell chose to say nothing when politics came up at his annual pre-Super Bowl news conference on Wednesday.“As commissioner of the NFL, I’m singularly focused on the Super Bowl right now,” Goodell told a reporter when asked for his thoughts on the executive order President Donald Trump signed Friday to temporarily ban refugees and travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries. “We have a unique position to have an event on Sunday that will bring the world together.”When Goodell announced that next season the NFL would once again play a game in Mexico City, a Hispanic reporter asked what the NFL could do “to help build a better relationship between Mexico and the U.S., and not necessarily build other things” ― a not-so-subtle reference to Trump’s plans to erect a wall along the southern border. Goodell chuckled, but avoided any comment on the wall.“One of the things that we truly believe in our hearts is that the NFL really does bond communities together and can be a bridge in that way,” Goodell said. “It unites people. We’re going to see it this weekend with the Super Bowl, where millions of people are going to tune in and they’re going to celebrate and they’re going to all forget about other things for at least a short period of time and really focus on having fun and being entertained by the Super Bowl.”Given the year the NFL has had and everything going on around him, Goodell’s unwillingness to even remotely address the issues at the forefront of seemingly everyone’s minds was striking — and possibly revealing.It started in the preseason, when Kaepernick, the San Francisco 49ers quarterback, refused to stand for the national anthem to protest racism and police killings of African Americans. His protest continued throughout the season, and players across the league and in other sports joined him. Many of Kaepernick’s actions ― he wore a Fidel Castro shirt; he denounced both Trump and Hillary Clinton; he didn’t vote ― sparked repeated rounds of political discussion inside and around football. In November, a group of NFL players visited Congress to discuss police brutality and race relations with lawmakers. In week 13, the league allowed players to dedicate their cleats to charitable causes ― many of which were inherently political.Patriots quarterback Tom Brady made his own statement when reporters noticed a “Make America Great Again” hat in his locker. Though Brady shied away from talking about politics after that, Trump, who has referred to him as a “friend,” didn’t: At a late campaign rally in New Hampshire, Trump touted Brady’s support and read a letter he received from Patriots coach Bill Belichick (Patriots owner Bob Kraft, too, is a friend and possible supporter of Trump). And New York Jets owner Woody Johnson served on Jeb Bush’s presidential campaign, before last month accepting an ambassadorship representing the Trump administration.The aura of politics hasn’t lifted just because it’s Super Bowl week, for obvious reasons. Border politics are a major issue across Texas, and the refugee ban is a specific concern in Houston: As SBNation observed this week, Houston is “a haven for refugees” — no American city welcomes more each year, a fact that has helped make Houston one of America’s most diverse cities.As the NFL’s celebrations kicked off Monday, demonstrators rallied against Trump’s immigration policies outside the Super Bowl media center. Inside, it remained an issue on the minds of players and the media. Falcons owner Arthur Blank criticized Trump, while reporters badgered Brady and Belichick about the president (neither really said anything). A number of players said they would speak out on the order and other political issues after the game. Martellus Bennett, the Patriots tight end, said he won’t visit the White House if New England wins Sunday. Goodell, incidentally, said he had no knowledge of mentions of Trump disappearing from post-media day transcripts.Goodell’s silence on controversial issues is, ultimately, misleading. He and his league, whether they like to admit it or not, have always been political. The NFL has its own political action committee and has spent millions lobbying Congress. It begs voters to throw hundreds of millions in taxpayer money toward new stadiums. And as much as Goodell tried to root his personal opposition to Kaepernick’s protest in an appeal to patriotism, his and his league’s open embrace of that ideal — often in the form of unquestioned deference to law enforcement and the military — is itself a political position.This season and the actions players took during it should finally bury the idea that the NFL is disconnected from politics. “Political issues” such as police brutality and refugee bans and even the outcomes of elections affect its players and teams and the communities they are a part of. Goodell seems to believe he can only achieve his goals — $25 billion in annual revenue by 2027, and further growth internationally — by staying mum on divisive political issues and uniting people in their desire to consume more football (NFL regular season ratings, likely affected by an all-consuming presidential election, dropped 8 percent from a year ago). But in an era of newfound athlete activism, it was unrealistic to think NFL players, coaches and teams (and the media that covers them) wouldn’t eventually begin to speak out.The NFL, and Goodell, love to talk about how “football is family” — presumably for everyone. But sitting atop a league that has become more outspoken, in a city home to so many people who now feel more vulnerable than ever, Roger Goodell used his platform to stick to sports. The refugees and immigrants in the city hosting his Super Bowl don’t have that privilege.Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

The Pats, after all, haven’t lost since before Thanksgiving, and quarterback Tom Brady just completed the single greatest touchdown-interception ratio for a season in NFL history.Atlanta, one could argue, is playing just as well, having won six straight games and accumulating points at a nearly unheard-of rate. (Don’t say we didn’t warn you!) Quarterback Matt Ryan is the likely MVP and finished the regular season with the best passer rating in football ― a healthy 117.1. To put that number in perspective, consider that it’s the fifth-best clip in league history.His 38 touchdown passes trailed only Aaron Rodgers, whom he completely outperformed in the NFC Championship, while he also led the league in total quarterback rating (83.3) and yards per pass attempt (9.26) ― the most in NFL history.So, the game pits two teams with elite quarterbacks anchoring some of pro football’s most powerful offenses. However, the Falcons, as I’ve chronicled, have a vastly improving defense, which undoubtedly will come in handy on Sunday. And Brady’s weaknesses may help the Dirty Birds bring the first-ever Super Bowl win to Atlanta. (It will also be the city’s first pro sports championship since the 1995 Braves won the World Series.)While every quarterback hates to be hit, Brady might just hate it the most. In three of his Super Bowl appearances, he’s been sacked at least twice ― and the Patriots lost two of those. So, keeping him upright and comfortable in the pocket is paramount.Fortunately for the Falcons, they have an assortment of different ways to get to Brady. The most obvious choice is the league’s sack leader, first-team All-Pro selection Vic Beasley Jr. However, Beasley has failed to record a single quarterback hit or sack in the playoffs. In other words, he’s a great player, but he’s not Von Miller. A Beasley spark would be enormously helpful for Atlanta, but two areas where Dan Quinn’s defense may also have success getting after Brady are its linebackers and secondary.Rookie safety Keanu Neal is a Kam Chancellor clone who runs like a gazelle and hits as solid as a lion. He leads all rookies with his five forced fumbles, and is second with his 106 tackles. Don’t be surprised to see him blitz ― and get home ― from a variety of different spots.Additionally, don’t be surprised if Dwight Freeney becomes a factor. The 36-year-old is one of the greatest defensive ends ― a future first-ballot Hall of Famer ― and he was brought in last summer precisely for these moments. Expect him to make an impact rushing on crucial third downs.The other area where Quinn may be creative with his blitzes is from the cornerbacks. Losing Pro Bowler Desmond Trufant for the year back in November was a killer, but second-year man Jalen Collins and rookie undrafted free agent Brian Poole have picked up the slack in coverage ― though the Patriots are a different animal. Even still, Trufant is a terrific corner blitzer. Neither Poole nor Collins have been asked to do it yet, but both are sound, physical tacklers who play bigger than their frames suggest (see below).Should Quinn send one of his corners on a blitz, expect the Falcons’ defense to use more Cover 3 looks ― the style that Quinn brought from his days coordinating the Seahawks’ dominant defense. The 46-year-old head coach has shifted to more man-to-man coverage looks this year, but isn’t afraid to run zone when the situations dictates it. Brady, to be sure, is as smart as they come at identifying what the defense is doing ― especially in his pre-snap reads ― and thus is a challenging chess match for Quinn and his staff.Defense, you see, has been the difference during Atlanta’s run. We can talk about Julio Jones, Ryan and the dual threat running backs all we want, but during the Falcons’ last eight games ― seven of which they’ve won ― the defense has given up only 20.5 points per matchup, totaling 17 sacks and 16 forced turnovers.

Tom Price (R-Ga.) as head of the department of the Department of Health and Human Services, a small but vocal cohort, the newly formed Clinician Action Network, has vowed to advocate for patients beyond the exam room. “We’re going to be very responsive to legislation that is being introduced and voted on in Congress, both at the state level and the national level,” Dr. Jane Zhu of the University of Pennsylvania, one of CAN’s founders, told HuffPost in December. “This is the time for clinicians to take part actively in a process that’s always been dominated by politicians.”Among the group’s demands: barring insurance companies from discriminating against patients with disabilities, maintaining subsidies to keep health insurance affordable for vulnerable populations, expanding Medicaid coverage and ― at the top of CAN’s to-do list ― maintaining essential health benefits, such as mental health services, treatment for opioid use disorder, prenatal and reproductive care and access to contraception.Regardless of their politics, health care providers want patients to know they support them.“People need to know that we’re not going to go away, we’re not going to stop resisting. We’re a loud voice, and we hold a lot of power as clinicians and we’re here for the long haul,” Nisen said. “These people, these are the future of medicine,” she said, referring to the protesters around her. “These are students and young doctors. That gives me hope.”How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you? Sign up for our weekly newsletter and get breaking updates on Trump’s presidency by messaging us here."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/589358532800001f00996707.jpeg?cache=OobWLlTj5n&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A search is underway for a Canadian filmmaker and shark conservationist who vanished Tuesday during a dive off the Florida Keys.Rob Stewart, 37, who directed and produced the award-winning documentary “Sharkwater,” was last seen near Alligator Reef off Lower Matecumbe Key around 5 p.m., the U.S. Coast Guard said in a statement.The Toronto resident was using closed-circulation rebreathing equipment while exploring a shipwreck with a small team, his friend Paul Watson wrote on Facebook.This rebreathing system eliminates bubbles by removing carbon dioxide from recirculated air, making a diver less likely to scare off fish. However, the equipment can carry more risks than conventional scuba tanks, the Miami Herald reported.Speaking to CTV News on Thursday, Stewart’s sister said that after surfacing from their third expedition of the day, one team member passed out. During the rescue, the boat “lost sight” of her brother, she said.Stewart, who had been working on a sequel to his film, likely also passed out before floating away, Watson wrote.“When last seen Rob was wearing a drysuit and a rebreather apparatus,” Watson added. “Hopefully the drysuit will keep him afloat but the fear is that he sank near where he was last seen. Divers with deep water experience are participating in the search.”Stewart’s father, Brian, confirmed details of his son’s disappearance to Florida’s Sun-Sentinel, noting that Rob is a “very, very experienced diver” who has dedicated his life to conservation efforts.“His mission in life is to save the world’s oceans from the devastation being wreaked upon them,” his father said.Stewart’s friends and family have asked the public to help with the search. A GoFundMe page to help cover the costs has been set up. As of Thursday it had raised more than $115,000.“All excess funds not used will be donated to www.finfree.org to help address the global slaughter of sharks,” the page reads."
41,POLITICS,Trump Team Sent Federal Watchdogs An Ominous Message That Has People Worried,Ryan J. Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-inspectors-general-firing_us_5890e1e2e4b0522c7d3d95be,Democrats want to know if inspectors general really are in the firing line.,2017-02-02,"President Trump's transition team told inspectors general that they were staying ""on a temporary basis.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5890e3501700002f001d17c7.jpeg?cache=6eftbF1RC2&ops=crop_13_0_3487_2086%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― It was a week before President Donald Trump’s inauguration, and hockey fans in D.C. were watching the Washington Capitals take on the Chicago Blackhawks. The Justice Department’s top watchdog, Inspector General Michael Horowitz, was in the crowd at the Verizon Center when he received a disturbing call.Just a day earlier, Horowitz’s office had announced that he would be examining the actions of Justice Department and FBI officials in connection with the investigation of Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. FBI Director James Comey’s handling of that investigation had come under intense scrutiny, with many Democrats blaming Comey for Clinton’s election defeat.Now, on the evening of Jan. 13, Horowitz answered a call from Inspector General John Roth, his counterpart at the Department of Homeland Security. Roth told Horowitz that he’d just been informed by the head of the Trump transition team’s Homeland Security landing team that his job was temporary.That Trump official “had assumed that I was already in the process of looking for another job,” Roth testified before the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday.Horowitz, who heads the independent Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, was surprised by the call. Although the inspectors general serve at the pleasure of the president, politics aren’t supposed to come into play in the selection of these watchdogs. There is a long tradition of inspectors general sticking around through a presidential transition, and they are expected to play a crucial role in the Trump era.“I spoke with him from the game, then got word on two other IGs who had received calls that evening,” Horowitz said.“We were trying to figure out what was going on here,” Horowitz testified Wednesday. “I think it’s fair to say everyone was concerned.” Roth was, in fact, not the only inspector general to receive a phone call. Several others took similar calls or were left voicemail messages that put their job security in jeopardy. A transcript of one such message, obtained by the House Oversight Committee, read like this:I’m calling on behalf of the presidential transition team to inform you that you are being held over on a temporary basis to continue working in the capacity as inspector general following the inauguration.Those calls were a result of a Jan. 13 email titled “TONIGHT: Inspector Generals Notification.” The email, which was first reported by The Washington Post, directed Trump’s “team leads” to call their IGs and let them know they were being “held over on a temporary basis.” It also mentioned that the current inspectors general would be vetted based on information the team leads had provided.As The Huffington Post noted in December, it’s only tradition that has secured the IG jobs through past presidential transitions. Trump could replace all of them if he chose, although he’d have to give Congress 30 days’ notice and provide some sort of explanation. But given the backlash that occurred when President Ronald Reagan fired most IGs as he took office, it wasn’t a scenario that seemed particularly likely.At Wednesday’s hearing, Democrats and Republicans offered much different interpretations of the Trump transition team’s actions. GOP members chalked up the messages left with inspectors general as the unremarkable missteps of a chaotic transition period.“I think it’s safe to say that was a mistake. They wish it hadn’t happened. It’s not their approach. It’s not their intention,” said Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the Oversight Committee, adding that the person who sent the original email was a low-level staffer. “With each new administration, I’m sure, there’s a learning curve, and hopefully they’ve learned that lesson.” Chaffetz said that White House Counsel Donald McGahn told him that the inspectors general have since been directed to disregard the messages.While Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) admitted he was “concerned” that the transition team hadn’t done a better job communicating with government officials about whether they would stay, he said the inspector general effort appeared to have been driven by a “very junior person.” When he Googled the name Katie Giblin, the individual who’d sent the email, the congressman said he didn’t find anything other than LinkedIn and Facebook pages. “I can’t find that this is a high-ranking person,” Issa said. “It appears that this is someone who, quite frankly, was put on the transition team like hundreds of other people.” Democrats think that something potentially more sinister was happening. Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, and Rep. Gerald Connolly (D-Va.) sent a letter to McGahn seeking clarification on the situation.“This email demonstrates that these calls were not isolated incidents,” Cummings said at the hearing on Wednesday. “This was a coordinated campaign to target inspectors general that someone in the Trump team planned, approved, organized and executed across multiple agencies.”Whoever approved the calls, Cummings said, “had absolutely horrendous judgment and should not be allowed anywhere near the reins of power.”The email itself may indicate the involvement of a more senior member of the transition team. Although the version displayed at the committee hearing was redacted, a person who had seen the full email told HuffPost that Justin Clark, now the White House director of intergovernmental affairs, was named as one of two individuals to be informed once the inspectors general were notified of their “temporary” status.Horowitz isn’t the only IG currently conducting an investigation with considerable political consequences. The Intercept reported Wednesday that Roth’s office is looking into the botched rollout of Trump’s executive order banning travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries.Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

42,POLITICS,That Time Neil Gorsuch Stood Up For The 'Grossly Mistreated' Merrick Garland,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/neil-gorsuch-defended-merrick-garland_us_58920a00e4b02772c4ea822e,Senate Democrats have a tough choice ahead.,2017-02-02,Mitch McConnell wasted no time in meeting with Neil Gorsuch. He never gave Merrick Garland a hearing.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/589219631800002300b3c0bc.jpeg?cache=br21rKN9xC&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump’s newly announced Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, has begun to make the rounds in Washington ― meeting with senators, posing for pictures and hoping to get support from those on the fence about him.Sound familiar?That’s the same ritual Merrick Garland ― former President Barack Obama’s choice to fill the seat of the late Justice Antonin Scalia ― embarked on for several months after getting the nod for the job. It was a futile exercise: His nomination died with the old Congress, without a hearing or an up-or-down vote.How Senate Democrats respond to this unprecedented blockade is something their base will watch closely. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), the Senate minority leader, seems to be listening: He suggested he’ll insist on 60 votes to confirm Gorsuch ― the number of senators needed to break a filibuster, which Democrats may very well attempt once the nominee’s name comes to the Senate floor.Many years ago, when he was still in private practice, Gorsuch himself decried this spectacle.“Responsibility for the current morass does not rest with any one party or group; ample blame can be doled out all around. But litmus tests, grudge matches and payback are not the ways forward,” he wrote in a 2002 column, years before he became a judge. “Excellence is.”To make his point, he singled out two judges who at the time had been subject to partisan delays: Garland and John Roberts, who in time would become colleagues on the federal appeals court in Washington. Both of them, Gorsuch wrote, were “grossly mistreated” by senators from both parties, despite being amply qualified.Fast forward 14 years, and Gorsuch seems to have recognized that Garland was grossly mistreated again: As soon as he learned Trump picked him for the Scalia vacancy, he reportedly gave Garland a call “out of respect.”That speaks well of Gorsuch, who, by all accounts, is a highly regarded judge with the credentials to prove it, much like Garland is. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConell (R-Ky.) has already vowed, matter-of-factly, that Republicans will “get the judge confirmed.” But the ball really rests with Senate Democrats, who, as the minority, have a tough choice to make: Be respectful of the process, give the judge a fair hearing, and save the fire ― and the filibuster ― for when one of the more liberal justices retires or vacates their seat.Or the other choice: Burn the process to the ground once and for all. Which even Trump seems to support.After all, Republicans played dirty with Garland. They might think it’s only fair to do the same with Gorsuch. Gross mistreatment all around."
43,LATINO VOICES,Teen Plans To Tell The Immigrant Stories Trump's Administration Never Would,Carolina Moreno,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/teen-plans-to-tell-the-immigrant-stories-trumps-administration-never-would_us_5893856fe4b06f344e409326,Because you can't judge a whole community on the actions of a few.,2017-02-02,"Valeria Alvarado at the Woman's March in Houston, TX, January 21, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5893901c2800001f00996810.jpeg?cache=EVP947HJkv&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For HuffPost’s #LoveTakesAction series, we’re telling stories of how people are standing up to hate and supporting those most threatened. What will you stand up for? Tell us with #LoveTakesAction.When Valeria Alvarado learned that President Donald Trump had called for a weekly list of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants, she took action.The 19-year-old Villanova University student decided to create an organization that would fight Trump’s actions by highlighting positive immigrant stories. Alvarado recently started the Facebook page “We, Too, Are America,” a name she acknowledges has also been used by other pro-immigrant movements on Twitter and to celebrate Black History Month. “When I read [Trump’s executive] order, I knew it would unfairly define a community of over 11 million people by the actions of a few,” Alvarado told The Huffington Post on Thursday. “Being close to the community, I decided to do a counter-list where we would publish a weekly list of accomplishments by the undocumented community.”The positive response she received over the initial idea prompted her to open up the platform to not only include stories about undocumented immigrants but also feature achievements by refugees and the immigrant community as a whole. The student says these groups are also negatively affected by Trump’s recent directives. Alvarado is an immigrant herself; she moved from Monterrey, Mexico to the United States at the age 4. The teen is currently spending a semester abroad in Rwanda studying post-genocide restoration.“I could not believe my eyes when I first read Trump’s plan to publish this list,” Alvardo told Remezcla in a recent interview. “This ‘crime list’ idea is not new. The Nazis used to publish a list of Jewish crimes before the genocide started. The RTML radio in Rwanda used to convince people that Tutsis were to blame for the crimes of the few. I am not trying to homogenize these situations with each other, but it is unbelievable that we are repeating history’s same mistakes.” Alvarado, who is a U.S. citizen, recognizes that not all immigrants have the opportunity to become legal. “I was lucky enough to become a citizen in 2013,” she told HuffPost. “I use the word ‘luck’ because I believe the citizenship process requires more than just hard work, it requires luck. There are so many in our community still stuck in the process, after years and years of working hard towards becoming a citizen.”The “We, Too, Are America” Facebook page has accrued more than 1,000 followers in its first six days. Alvarado and her small team plan to publish their first weekly list of immigrant stories on Monday, Feb. 6. “We, Too, Are America wants to publish stories from all walks of life and all professions,” she said. “Our goal is not to build the ‘model minority’ image, but instead, counter a false image with a positive and more diverse image of our community.”The 2016 election was the first time Alvarado had the opportunity to vote for a presidential candidate, a privilege she took seriously. While the outcome was not what she expected, she intends to keep fighting for her ideals. “Voting for the first time was a bittersweet moment,” she told HuffPost. “I was happy I was able to go in the voting booth to exercise my rights. I also had to think about the privilege I have as a citizen; our undocumented friends and family did not have an opportunity to vote in an election that would alter their lives. The three million more Americans and I that won the popular vote are disappointed in the outcome, pero como siempre me ha dicho mi papa: ‘es tiempo para ponerte las pilas’ (which translates to, ‘but like my dad always told me: ‘it’s time to get to work’’). A Trump presidency will not bring us down. We will not stand by silently.”How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

44,ENTERTAINMENT,How Train’s Pat Monahan Continues To Create Hit After Hit,Lauren Moraski,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/train-pat-monahan-continues-to-create-hit-after-hit_us_5892015ae4b02772c4ea6d51,"You might recognize the tune that inspired the group's latest, ""Play That Song.""",2017-02-02,"Pat Monahan of Train attends Build Series on Jan. 27, 2017, in New York.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5893488225000021000b6788.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Train frontman Pat Monahan doesn’t quite have a formula for creating a hit song. But somehow he’s managed to do it time and time again ― and for nearly two decades. Just last week, Train released a new studio album, called “A Girl, a Bottle, a Boat,” which features the single, “Play That Song.” The track, about getting a single played on radio, can, in fact, currently be heard on the national airwaves. It’s also climbing the Billboard Top 100 singles chart. And if the song sounds somewhat familiar, there’s a pretty good reason for that: “Play That Song” is inspired by a very popular tune. “The only reason why I thought that maybe this song would [get radio play] is because I took ‘Heart and Soul’s’ melody and was like, ‘OK, that’s a pretty good start.’ It’s one of the most memorable melodies of all time and made it into a new version,” Monahan told The Huffington Post at Build Series.The singer says he went through the proper channels to make sure Train had the rights to use the melody from “Heart and Soul.” “We talked to those people to make sure that we can figure out a way to use it. And they were ecstatic. It’s 81 years old!” Monahan said.The song’s upbeat sound reflects the vibe of the entire album, which is Train’s first new studio album with new material since 2014’s “Bulletproof Picasso.”“It’s really a beach, summertime, grab a bottle of wine and be with your favorite person on a boat kind of album. So it just made sense that my favorite things are girl, a bottle and being on a boat,” Monahan said. Monahan felt pretty confident that listeners would gravitate to “Play That Song,” but that wasn’t necessarily the case in the late ‘90s when Train first came on the scene to release the single, “Meet Virginia.” Monahan had no idea that the song would stick. “It was too weird and too new. And it was not something that was on the radio. A ukulele and a vocal, that was weird, too,” he said, adding, “I think it was a weird lyric. And I think the guitar part was so weird, too. Everybody’s like, ‘I think I’m going to be a guitar player from now on.’ It wasn’t that complicated.”Over the years, Train went on to have hits with “Drops of Jupiter,” “Calling All Angels,” “Cab,” “Marry Me” and “Hey, Soul Sister.” Monahan says he doesn’t feel too much pressure to snag a hit these days, though, of course, it’s nice to see. He just wants to challenge himself, work hard and make songs that fans dig, he says. But that doesn’t mean writing and coming up with new material always easy. “It’s hard to get inspired sometimes when you feel like you’ve said … like how many times can you say something in an original way? But I’m trying. I’m gonna keep doing it,” he said.Watch the full Build Series interview below."
45,MEDIA,Donald Trump’s ‘War’ With The Media Isn’t Enough To Kill The White House Correspondents' Dinner,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-white-house-correspondents-dinner_us_5893877de4b05c775abe8b68,"""We will celebrate the First Amendment and the role an independent press plays in a healthy republic,” WHCA president Jeff Mason said.",2017-02-02,"Despite Donald Trump's attacks, he White House Correspondents Dinner will continue as planned. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/589389ef25000032080b68e0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK ― President Donald Trump declared “war” on the press during his first full day in office and has since echoed chief strategist Steve Bannon’s description of the news media as “the opposition party.”But why should that get in the way of a good party. Jeff Mason, a Reuters correspondent and president of the White House Correspondents’ Association, informed members of the organization in an email Thursday that the annual event will take place on April 29, as had been previously announced. “This year, as we do every year, we will celebrate the First Amendment and the role an independent press plays in a healthy republic,” Mason wrote. “We will also reward some of the finest political reporting of the past year while using our scholarship program to highlight and support up-and-coming journalists who are the future of our profession.”Mason told The Huffington Post that he issued the statement after receiving questions about whether the dinner was still happening or would be changed in any way. Journalists might have understandably wondered if the show would go on given how Trump vilified the press during the 2016 election campaign, and as president, has continued attacking the media and suggesting legitimate news outlets produce “fake news.”Trump’s routine ridiculing of the press from the White House is unprecedented, leading some journalists to suggest skipping the dinner. “Faced with these attacks on our doing our job, we’re going to invite this guy to come and mock us in person?” Slate chairman Jacob Weisberg said at an NYU panel last week. “It’s abhorrent.”The president is traditionally invited to the dinner and usually gently roasts reporters before also saluting the work they do and role they play in a democracy.A White House spokeswoman did not immediately respond for comment on whether Trump plans to attend.Trump, like many celebrities, has attended the glitzy dinner in the past. It was President Barack Obama’s on-stage mockery of Trump at the 2011 gala ― coming after the reality star’s birther crusade ― which reportedly helped drive him to run for president. Even before the Trump era, some journalists have argued against the so-called “Nerd Prom,” from the unseemliness of news organizations jockeying for celebrity guests to the image of black tie clad reporters mingling at the Washington Hilton with the political elite they’re expected to hold accountable. “This is a moment when people already think the press is too cozy with government,” Dean Baquet, then-Washington bureau chief of the New York Times, said in 2007. “And I think these events confirm that.”The Times, now led by Baquet, has not attended since. The WHCA dinner will also have competition this year across town. Samantha Bee, host of TBS late-night show “Full Frontal” announced this week that she will be hosting a counter event ― “Not the White House Correspondents’ Dinner” ― at The Willard Hotel. “The evening is sure to bring plenty of surprises, music, food, and laughter—and if you’re not careful you just might learn something,” Bee said in a statement. “Specifically, you’ll learn how screwed we’d be without a free press.”While the White House Correspondents’ Association may be best known outside Washington for the celebrity-packed dinner, Mason emphasized in his statement that the group’s primary role is advocating on behalf of the press. “In the meantime, the WHCA will pursue its core mission of advocating for journalists’ ability to ask questions of government officials, push for transparency from the presidency, and help Americans hold the powerful to account,” he wrote. “This is a responsibility that we have taken seriously for more than 100 years and will continue to uphold.”"

She has since recanted, stating that she was counseled to file a report of abuse during divorce proceedings. Puzder has consistently denied the allegations. The Riverfront Times, a newspaper in St. Louis, first published claims in 1989 that Puzder was physically abusive and resurfaced the story after he was picked by President Donald Trump in December. According to court documents obtained by the paper, Puzder’s wife, known as Lisa Henning at the time, alleged that he hit her and threw her to the kitchen floor during an altercation in 1986.She also filed for a protective order, claiming that Puzder “attacked me, choked me, threw me to the floor, hit me in the head pushed his knee into my chest twisted my ar​m and dr​agged me​ ​on the floor, threw me against a wall, tried to stop my call to 911 and kicked me in the back.”Court records obtained by Politico found that Fierstein filed at least three legal documents accusing Puzder of assaulting her in 1986.In one petition, her injuries were described as “bruises and contusions to the chest, back, shoulders and neck” and “two ruptured discs and two bulging discs,” and “all of the muscles, bones, ligaments and soft tissue of [Fierstein’s] face, chest, back, shoulders, and neck were violently wrenched, strained, swollen, contused and otherwise injured.”She also allegedly went on “The Oprah Winfrey Show” in disguise to talk about her experience as a survivor of domestic violence. The date of that television appearance is unclear.A spokesperson for Puzder, speaking to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, called the lawsuit a “shameless attempt to smear an individual who has shown nothing but dedication to creating jobs.” After being pushed back for a fourth time, a Senate committee hearing on Puzder has been delayed indefinitely until he provides the required paperwork.Puzder is not the only man Trump has chosen to wield immense power who has been accused of abusing women. White House chief strategist Steve Bannon also faced claims of physical abuse by his wife, and Trump himself has been accused of sexually assaulting multiple women.______Related Coverage"
47,POLITICS,Dems See Pat Toomey As 'Best Option' For Sinking Betsy DeVos' Confirmation,Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pat-toomey-betsy-devos_us_58927b1ee4b0af07cb6b7d0a,"They're flooding the Republican senator with calls, but nobody is answering.",2017-02-02,This is the face of a senator that progressive groups think they can persuade to vote with them.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58936a291900003400e09a40.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Democrats have singled out Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) as their best hope for sinking President Donald Trump’s education secretary nominee, Betsy DeVos ― whose confirmation is hanging by a thread ― and they’re flooding his phone lines to the point where nobody is answering calls at any of his offices.The Senate is expected to vote on DeVos’ confirmation on Tuesday, and it could be a nail-biter. Two GOP senators, Susan Collins (Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), stunned observers Wednesday by saying they won’t support her, which means it takes only one more Republican to deny her confirmation. If all Democrats vote no, as expected, and all other Republicans vote yes, which looks likely but isn’t definite, that produces a tie vote. Vice President Mike Pence is prepared to come to the Senate to break a tie.That’s where Toomey comes in. He’s called DeVos a “a great pick” and, feeling some outside pressure on Wednesday, told a Pennsylvania paper, “I will absolutely be voting for Betsy DeVos.” On Thursday night, he issued a statement declaring again, “I am pleased to vote to confirm Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education.” That doesn’t sound like a person ready to oppose DeVos, but some Democrats think they can pressure the GOP senator to flip. One congressional Democrat said Toomey has emerged as their “best option.”Progressive activists see the next few days as their window for wearing down Toomey. Keystone Progress, a Pennsylvania progressive advocacy group, spent Thursday morning urging DeVos critics to call the senator and make the case for why he should oppose her confirmation. But people calling in are all getting a busy signal or being diverted to a full voicemail box. The Huffington Post called all eight of Toomey’s offices in D.C. and around Pennsylvania, and got the same results each time too.“It’s a testimony to our grassroots organizing, if I can brag a little bit,” said Mike Morrill of Keystone Progress. “I’ve never had this happen in my decades of organizing. The congressional phone systems are designed to handle huge volumes of calls.”Toomey spokesman E.R. Anderson confirmed their call volume has intensified, but didn’t say whether it was because of people opposed to DeVos.“There is a lot going on in Washington right now,” Anderson said. “As such, many Pennsylvanians are calling to make their voices heard on a lot of issues. Senator Toomey’s staff in both Pennsylvania and Washington are taking an ‘all hands on deck’ approach in answering as many calls as possible while also attending to other responsibilities, such as helping veterans, seniors, and attending to legislative concerns. Voicemail accounts are being emptied regularly, but with call volume as heavy as it is, mailboxes do fill quickly.”Pennsylvania’s other senator, Bob Casey (D), has been flooded with calls about DeVos, too. Casey himself started answering the phones Thursday to relay his concerns to constituents about her confirmation.Casey spokeswoman Jacklin Rhoads said their office has received about 80,000 emails and letters this week about DeVos ― and that’s not even including the calls they’ve gotten. She said most constituents are calling to oppose DeVos.Progressives are still trying to get through to Toomey. Keystone Progress emailed supporters later Thursday to say they’d “generated so many calls that Toomey has turned off his phones! Don’t let him get away with ignoring us!” The email directs readers to a page where people can email his office instead. Daily Kos also published Toomey’s contact information in a Wednesday post titled “Let’s Go After Pat Toomey (R) On Betsy DeVos And Get Him To Vote No.”There’s even a Philadelphia teacher raising money online to “buy” Toomey’s vote. Since DeVos previously gave $55,800 to Toomey’s Senate campaign, Katherine Fritz started a GoFundMe campaign on Wednesday, as a joke, to match that amount and give it to Toomey in exchange for him agreeing to oppose DeVos. The joke campaign took off, and Fritz has already raised $12,731 as of Thursday afternoon. Her effort is “getting more traffic than any other active campaign,” said Bobby Whithorne of GoFundMe.Senators opposed to DeVos, a billionaire Republican donor, say it’s because she lacks the qualifications for the job and is not committed to public education. Education groups in Toomey’s state, such as the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers, have strongly condemned her nomination, saying, “the only experience she’s ever had for public education is a commitment to destroy it.”DeVos had a rocky confirmation hearing last month, during which she didn’t seem to understand a key federal law involving students with disabilities. She also suggested guns belong in schools for fighting off grizzly bears.Laura Bassett contributed reporting.This story has been updated with information about Katherine Fritz’s GoFundMe campaign, and to reflect DeVos’ vote will be on Tuesday instead of Monday. It has also been updated to include a statement from Toomey released Thursday night."

The Supreme Court ruled in November, after a lengthy legal battle, that settlers had to leave Amona because their homes were built on privately-owned Palestinian land.With no weapons visible, but wearing backpacks, hundreds of police walked past burning tyres and pushed back against dozens of nationalist Israeli youths who flocked to Amona in support of the settlers.Several protesters were detained by police during the scuffles and there were a few instances of stone-throwing. A police spokesmen said at least 10 officers were injured slightly by rocks and caustic liquid thrown at them.“A Jew doesn’t evict a Jew!” the youngsters chanted.The Amona settlers themselves stayed largely put inside their homes after erecting makeshift barriers in front of their doors and vowing passive resistance to eviction.“We won’t leave our homes on our own. Pull us out, and we’ll go,” one settler told reporters. “It is a black day for Zionism.”On a nearby hilltop, Issa Zayed, a Palestinian who said he was one of the owners of the land on which Amona was built, watched the scene through binoculars. “With God’s help, it will be evacuated and our land will return to us,” he said.NEW SETTLER HOMESEarlier, Israel announced plans for 3,000 more settlement homes in the West Bank, the third such declaration in 11 days since U.S. President Donald Trump took office. Trump, a Republican, has signaled he could be more accommodating toward such projects than his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama.An announcement a week ago by Israel that it would build some 2,500 more dwellings in the West Bank, territory captured in a 1967 Middle East war and where Palestinians now seek statehood, drew rebukes from the Palestinians and the European Union. It followed approval a few days before of over 560 new homes in East Jerusalem, also taken by Israel in 1967.“The decision ... will place obstacles in the path of any effort to start a peace process that will lead to security and peace,” said Nabil Abu Rdainah, a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.Palestinians want the West Bank and Gaza Strip for an independent state, with its capital in East Jerusalem.

50,WOMEN,Teen Girls React To Trump's Muslim Ban In Powerful Snapchat Story,Antonia Blumberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/teen-girls-react-to-trumps-muslim-ban-in-powerful-snapchat-story_us_5890e8e5e4b0c90eff009e79,Because their voices deserve to be heard.,2017-02-01,"Snapchat influencer Anna Russett, aka ""bananapotatos."" ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5890f8961700002f001d1879.jpeg?cache=Qorj0fxsC7&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump has been making a lot of decisions lately surrounded by other middle-aged, white men. When he signed an executive order on Friday halting the U.S. refugee resettlement program and blocking the entry of people from seven Muslim-majority countries, social media influencer and strategist Anna Russett wanted to make sure his voice wasn’t the only one being heard.Russett, 25, issued a callout Monday night through her Snapchat profile, “bananapotatos,” and invited her audience to send in short videos expressing their thoughts and reactions to what’s come to be known as the “Muslim ban.” Her audience is largely comprised of teenage girls and college-aged women, with a handful of young men and gender fluid individuals, Russett said. And they, too, have something to say.“Rarely do people take teen girls seriously,” Russett told The Huffington Post. “But their voices are so strong and they have so many opinions and want to do a lot of good for the world.”Russett posted the callout Monday evening and had received over a thousand videos by Tuesday afternoon, she said.“I’m a Muslim, and to see this going on in our world is scary and sad,” one girl said.Another young woman commented: “That Trump identifies with a denomination of Christianity is disgusting because this is not Christ-like.”Many of those responded from countries outside the U.S., including Ireland, Colombia, El Salvador, Canada, Australia, South Africa, and more. They expressed a range in opinions, from denouncing Trump to saying they felt the president acted with the country’s safety in mind. “I was really interested in all those opinions,” Russett said, “and in facilitating a conversation in a respectful way, letting these girls listen to each other and really understand where each other is coming from.”Russett was actively watching and curating the videos back in her Snapchat story on Tuesday, which meant the influencer could choose which voices she wanted to include. Namely, Russett said she wasn’t willing to “give hate a platform.” Instead, the stories that stood out to her most were the ones with a personal angle. “Hearing very visceral, real accounts of how this is affecting people is really moving and really powerful to hear,” Russett said.“I want to thank Trump for bringing to light the racists in my high school,” commented one Muslim young woman who said she’d lived through the recent civil war in Libya and emigrated to Canada with her family to escape from violence.Stories of families being split and travelers turned away at airports and even detained put a human face to the news. And they’re especially important to remember as White House officials attempt to downplay the effects of the executive order.But more and more, social media users and influencers are taking the administration to task for its discriminatory actions. With public demonstrations like the recent Women’s March, grassroots protests and airport rallies, Russett suggested that the role of influencers and even the average person with a smart phone is more critical than ever.“For people with a platform right now I do think it’s their responsibility to think about speaking up,” Russett said. But she added the caveat that “anybody who does speak out about current events should have an informed opinion.”"

The president has claimed that the new restrictions honor the lives lost on that tragic day.Now, some victims’ family members are speaking out against Trump’s order ― and claiming that his administration is using their loved ones’ deaths to stoke fear. A group of eight individuals involved with the organization September 11th Families for Peaceful Tomorrows came together on Tuesday to denounce Trump’s ban as thoroughly un-American.Terry McGovern, whose mother Ann McGovern died in the South Tower, said that she was “sickened” by Trump’s use of September 11 to justify “hatred, bigotry, and religious discrimination.”“Don’t use our loved ones, and especially my mother, to turn away refugees,” McGovern said during a press conference call arranged by the group. “This is not about protecting Americans. This is about bigotry. I for one am really tired of the exploitation of 9/11 for agendas that have nothing to do with our loved ones.”The stated purpose of Trump’s executive order, which was announced last Friday, is to “protect the American people from terrorist attacks by foreign nationals admitted to the United States.” The order suspends all refugee resettlement for 120 days and indefinitely blocks Syrian refugees. It also temporarily bans people from seven Muslim-majority countries ― Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen ― from entering the United States. Notably missing from that list are the countries the terrorists involved in the September 11 attacks originated from: Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Lebanon. The order resulted in legal challenges, confusion and protests across the country. Hundreds of travelers were reportedly detained at airports over the weekend. The Department of Homeland Security announced on Tuesday that it is planning to make some exceptions to the ban.The president has denied that the executive order is a Muslim ban. However, the order prioritizes Christian applicants over Muslim applicants, even though many victims of terror attacks are Muslim. Talat Hamdani is an American Muslim whose son, Mohammad Salman Hamdani, lost his life at the Twin Towers as a first responder to the attacks. During the call, she said she believes Trump’s order amounts to “religious persecution” and that she fears it will eventually lead to more stringent attacks on the American Muslims’ freedoms.“There is a lot of fear, intimidation and anxiety among the community,” Hamdani said. “This order has disrupted our lives.”September 11th Families for Peaceful Tomorrows began in 2002 as a critique of U.S. military action in Afghanistan that claimed civilian lives.There are currently about 30 active members who participate regularly in the organization, although its official membership count is 241. The group has come together over the years to speak out whenever the tragic events of that day are used by politicians to justify other deaths.The group does not represent all families of 9/11 victims. Kathleen Ganci, whose husband was the highest-ranking New York City Fire Department killed in the attacks, expressed her support for the ban to The New York Times.“Walk in my shoes, is my point,” Ganci said. “You can’t just let people into this country because you have a big heart.” But Emma Barker-Lasar, whose great-uncle Abraham Zelmanowitz died in the attacks, spoke of Trump’s order as a fresh injustice that is “unacceptable to any reasonable person.” “We cannot and should not allow them to be carried out in our names, or in the names of our loved ones,” Barker-Lasar said during the call.Other family members against the ban included Terry Rockefeller, John Sigmund, Andrew Rice, Barry Amundson and Adele Welty.Welty, who lost her firefighter son Timothy Welty in the attacks, expressed concerns about the Islamophobic rhetoric Trump has used to target both refugees and American Muslims. She pointed out that this kind of discrimination against minorities has happened before in American history ― in the way the United States treated Japanese Americans and Jewish refugees during World War II. Welty spoke of own experiences as a child growing up in an Italian immigrant family. She said she remembered being associated with stereotypes about the mafia, just because of her heritage.It’s that same “bigoted paranoia” in American society today that refuses to distinguish between terrorism and religion, she said.“I get very emotional about it because it’s very real to me from my own childhood and I see it happening now to poor [American Muslim] children,” Welty said. “It’s wrong, it’s moronic ... We want to welcome everyone onto our shores. This is supposed to be a safe haven.”"

Susan Collins (Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) announced Wednesday that they would not be voting for Betsy DeVos as education secretary, potentially imperiling the nominee’s confirmation. No Democratic senators are expected to vote for DeVos. If no other Republicans vote against DeVos, Vice President Mike Pence would be the tie-breaking vote. DeVos needs a simple majority to be confirmed. If Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) is confirmed as attorney general before DeVos comes before a full Senate vote, it could further complicate her chances for confirmation. In that scenario, Sessions would not be eligible to vote.When speaking on the Senate floor, Collins said that while she thinks DeVos is a good person, she questioned her commitment to traditional public schools ― which a majority of children in the country attend. Murkowski said she has been inundated with calls from constituents who questioned the nominee’s lack of experience working with public schools. DeVos ― who comes from a conservative, billionaire Michigan family ― is an education activist and has championed alternatives to traditional public schools, like charter schools and voucher programs. Voucher programs enable taxpayer money to be used to help kids go to private schools.In recent weeks, grassroots opposition to DeVos has grown, and protests against her have broken out across the country. Collins and Murkowski voted for DeVos to advance through the Senate HELP committee on Tuesday, but expressed reservations about the nominee. The Senate HELP committee deals with health, education, labor and pensions. UPDATE: 5:00 p.m. ― Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.), who was thought of as a potential no vote on DeVos, confirmed on Wednesday that he will support her confirmation.Feb. 2 ― Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.), who was being floated as a possible no vote among Democrats, will support DeVos, according to Ryan Bernstein, the senator’s chief of staff. This increases the odds that she will narrowly make it through the Senate, with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) having set the stage for a final vote this Friday. "

When President Donald Trump announced Tuesday night that his Supreme Court pick would be Neil Gorsuch, they were, by and large, preparing for the normal Senate process and ready to consider the nominee on his merits.But they can’t forget about Merrick Garland.That was President Barack Obama’s pick for the Supreme Court seat that opened up in February 2016 ― the same seat Trump is now filling. Republicans prevented Obama from filling the seat all year by denying Garland a hearing, insisting that, because Obama was in his final year in office, the next president should get to fill the seat. It was a cynical strategy hatched by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to hold the seat open for Trump, and it worked. Republicans now get to fill the seat with a GOP nominee.Though they say they’re ready to move on, it’s clear that Democrats view their role in considering Gorsuch’s nomination, and the Senate’s processes, more cynically. They remember the unprecedented level of obstruction Republicans waged on Garland, a Supreme Court nominee who GOP senators didn’t even oppose on his merits. Perhaps more importantly, they remember how McConnell violated the norms of the Senate, an institution the prides itself on its adherence to rules and decorum.“The ghost of Merrick Garland still floats around part of this place,” said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.).“I’m going to take a look at his nominee … but let’s make it clear: This is a different process now because of what they did last year,” he said. “They made the decision to politicize the Supreme Court process, and ultimately they’ll have to own that.”Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), who was the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee last year and led the push to get Garland a hearing, said he still can’t believe the way Republicans treated Obama’s nominee.“I’m the longest-serving senator. I’ve never seen anything like that with either the Republicans or the Democrats,” Leahy said. “We all take an oath to uphold the Constitution. The Constitution says the president shall nominate, says we shall advise and consent. The president followed the Constitution. The Senate violated it.”“It’s still a painful memory,” added Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (Ill.). “But we’re committed to doing what Mitch McConnell would not do, and that is giving the nominee a hearing.”The Huffington Post talked to several Democratic senators to gauge how deeply the past year’s Supreme Court fight may have tainted their views on how the Senate is supposed to work. Their initial responses were pragmatic and reasoned, like Durbin’s, emphasizing the need to treat all nominees fairly. A Supreme Court confirmation may be the most important vote they take in their entire Senate career, some argued, and these types of nominations require thoughtful, apolitical vetting.But probing a little deeper, there was a simmering anger.“Of course it does,” Durbin snapped, when asked if the Garland fight soured his perspective on how the Senate is supposed to function.“This has never happened before in the history of the United States. Never. Durbin said never, yes he said never,” he continued. “And [McConnell] did it gleefully. McConnell announced the day after the election, ‘I won! We kept the vacancy open and now President Trump gets to fill it.’ Do we remember? Sure.”Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) said Tuesday before Trump’s announcement that she wanted to wait to learn about the nominee before saying much about the confirmation process. She stepped into an elevator as a HuffPost reporter asked if she had lingering bad feelings from Garland’s fight.“What do you think?” she asked as the doors closed.Some Democrats said Republicans’ treatment of Garland did lasting damage to government operations, and not just the Senate.“We now have, in effect, an acceptance of deferring consideration of a Supreme Court nominee simply for political purposes, and that politicized and degraded the United States Supreme Court as an institution,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.).It’s not unheard of for one party to torpedo another party’s Supreme Court nominee. Democrats did it to Republicans in 1987, when they rejected Robert Bork’s nomination by President Ronald Reagan in a 42-58 vote. There were 54 Democrats in the Senate at the time. The difference, though, is that Bork got a hearing and a vote. Garland didn’t get either.Shortly after Trump’s announcement, Democrats were already citing Garland in their statements.“Before Senate Republicans waged the unprecedented blockade of Chief Judge Garland’s nomination to the Supreme Court last year, the Senate took seriously its constitutional duty to provide advice and consent on nominees to the highest court in the land,” said Leahy. “But Republicans abdicated the Senate’s constitutional role by choosing politically-charged obstruction, so that a president who lost the popular vote could nominate extreme candidates to the Supreme Court.”Despite their frustration, Democratic leaders’ strategy is to tread lightly for now, in part to make sure Republicans keep the Senate’s filibuster rule in place as the confirmation process unfolds. That rule requires 60 votes, versus 51 votes, to advance a Supreme Court nominee. There are currently 52 Republicans and 48 Democrats (that’s including the two independents, who caucus with them) in the Senate, which means that if Democrats stick together, they have the ability to sink or confirm Trump’s nominee.Senators in both parties have debated over the years whether to get rid of that rule and make all Senate actions require 51 votes. The point of the filibuster, as envisioned by its founders, is to give the Senate a mechanism to slow down and ensure bipartisan support for matters that the House may pass hastily. Democrats infuriated Republicans in 2013 by nixing the rule for lower-court nominees in response to ongoing GOP obstruction of Obama’s court picks. They left the rule in place for Supreme Court nominees, though.Trump, sensing a close fight ahead on his court pick, has already signaled he wants McConnell to get rid of the filibuster. But McConnell, an institutionalist at heart, seems unwilling so far. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) wants to keep it that way.“We have no intention of getting rid of the 60-vote hurdle. We didn’t then; we didn’t now,” Schumer told reporters at the Capitol. “When we made a rules change after Republican obstruction … we explicitly put forward that 60 should stay on the Supreme Court. The reason for that is simple: We thought this was such an important position that it ought to be bipartisan and mainstream in terms of the nominees.”Time will tell if the Garland standoff did lasting damage to how the Senate operates. For now, Democrats say they are committed to preserving the institution and its mission over politics, even if that means considering a nominee for a Supreme Court seat they don’t think belongs to Republicans.“They stole the seat, clearly, a year ago,” said Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio). “I think it’s a betrayal of what this country is and the values it stands for.”This story has been updated to include a comment from Leahy after the announcement of Gorsuch’s nomination."
59,WOMEN,This Muslim Mom Was Targeted By Hate. Her Neighbors Refused To Stay Silent,Carol Kuruvilla,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ohio-muslim-woman-flyers_us_589206c8e4b02772c4ea757d,"“We will show up, stand up, and stand against any hateful act in our community.”",2017-02-01,Rawd Saleh speaks at a rally in front of the Mason Community Center.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/589253721c00002e004b84ac.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"An attempt to spread Islamophobia through an Ohio neighborhood backfired last weekend, resulting instead in numerous acts of love and solidarity.Ohioans have been rallying around Rawd Saleh, a 41-year-old mother of three from Mason, Ohio. Saleh came home from a weekend away to find out that flyers had been posted in houses in her neighborhood that falsely accused her family of having ties to terrorism. The anonymous “neighborhood terrorist warning” had Saleh’s name, address, photo, and even a map showing exactly where her house was located.“It was an awful feeling for me, to know that someone out there thinks that my life and my children’s lives are not valuable at all, someone who would put my name and address out there for anyone who could possibly want to hurt us,” Saleh, who has lived in America for 35 years, told The Huffington Post. But Saleh soon learned that this wasn’t a fight she would have to face alone. When Saleh’s neighbors found the notes in their mailboxes, they leapt into action ― alerting the police and reassuring Saleh’s family that they supported her and her kids. Saleh told The Huffington Post that the neighbors have even pointed security cameras in the direction of her house in case anything suspicious were to happen. “They reassured me that they were here for me and for my children,” Saleh said. “And that we’re in this together.” But the support didn’t end there. As news of the flyers spread online, Saleh was contacted by two Ohioans, Sarah Martin and Cyndi Ritter, who offered to help. Within two days, the three organized a rally at the Mason Community Center.“I just started thinking about the women that wear hijab that are not as outspoken as me, or who haven’t been here for 35 years, and who don’t know their rights as Americans,” Saleh said. “The more and more I thought about it, I realized this really isn’t about me, it isn’t about Muslims. This is about hate. No one should have to go through something like this.”Over 300 people, hailing from Mason and from other towns across Ohio, attended the rally on Sunday. They held signs, brought their children, and chanted their support for Saleh. Martin told The Huffington Post that she wasn’t expecting such a large turnout. “Mason is a very diverse community but also a very conservative community so I was worried not many people would attend,” Martin said. “Once the event was created on Facebook, it just kept getting shared and people from outside the Mason community came to show support too.”Ritter was inspired to get involved after attending the Women’s March in Washington, D.C.“The message we wanted to send to the community was that Hate would not be tolerated,” Ritter wrote in an email. “We will show up, stand up, and stand against any hateful act in our community.”Saleh said was surrounded by support from the moment she joined the rally. It was “humbling” for her to see so many people she didn’t know come out to stand in solidarity. “There’s so much negativity right now in our country, but there’s still so much goodness and kindness and people who are willing to help and stand up for what’s right and support those who are being targeted,” Saleh said. The Mason Police Department told The Huffington Post that they have no information about who was responsible for the flyers, but that they’re conducting extra patrols in the area.The flyers were distributed a few days after President Trump signed an executive order targeting Muslim immigrants and refugees. The White House has denied that the order is a Muslim ban, although Trump has made it clear that Christians refugees would be prioritized over Muslims.In an interview with The Washington Post, Ohio’s governor, John Kasich, agreed that Trump is right to be concerned about vetting refugees who enter the country. However, he criticized the confusion the executive order has created and the fact that it sends “a message that somehow the United States was looking sideways at Muslims.”Saleh said she still feels nervous at home, since she’s not sure if anyone out there still has ill intentions toward her family. She’s had to warn her children to be extra vigilant, to lock doors and windows, and to keep the alarm system on. If she could speak to whomever distributed the flyer, Saleh said that she would forgive them. She hopes that the person will come forward soon.Saleh said that the outpouring of solidarity has given her hope. “Out of this one hateful act, I’ve gained over 100 new friends. Neighbors who I usually wave to as I run by are actually coming over to get to know me, and I’m inviting them to have breakfast with me,” Saleh said. “The outcome has been the opposite of what this person wanted it to be.”"

Created by two titans of the television industry, pro wrestling magnate Vince McMahon and NBC’s Dick Ebersol, the eight-team league was everything that the NFL still tries not to be: brash, abrasive and crazy.Before it was disbanded after a lone season, the XFL set a record high ― and multiple record lows ― in viewership. Players were mostly an odd collection of has-beens and never-weres, earning no more than $5,000 per week. As ESPN gets set to release the new “30 for 30” documentary, “This Was The XFL,” on Feb. 2, The Huffington Post caught up with Ebersol and his son, director Charlie Ebersol, to discuss the film and why the league still resonates with sports fans despite its failure 15 years ago.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.Walk me through the process of creating the XFL.Dick Ebersol: Vince and I had been business partners starting in 1985 for five years, and then I had taken the sports job at NBC, so I couldn’t be in a private sports enterprise simultaneously, but we had maintained a really good personal friendship. So here he was, announcing a football league, and it seems interesting enough to me. He called me on the phone and I said, “I heard enough to tell you that I have some interest, because I know that we could have good fun with all this, but I need to understand better what your plan is. So don’t talk to anybody about TV.” Or he definitely hadn’t talked to anybody about TV anyway. And within ― believe it or not ― I think six weeks, we had a deal to be 50-50 joint ventures.Putting the on-field product aside for a moment, the XFL revolutionized the way sports were sold. DE: As you’ll see in the show, the greatest thing about the league was the way that it was sold. The anticipation became so enormous that it blew us away. I’ll never forget going into the first game. I actually thought that there were a lot of people out there who thought our brand of football was going to be so radically different that the linebackers ― in a defensive set ― would be allowed to have chairs to hit the quarterbacks over the head. Because, if you remember, that was the standard wrestling thing, grab a ring-side chair and go back and hit somebody over the head and supposedly knock him out. I don’t think I’m wrong in telling you this: You’ll laugh your ass off, if nothing else, and it’s great fun with something that ended up being such an oversized flop. The skycam ― now a staple at marquee sporting events ― was first introduced at scale by the XFL. How did that even come about?  Charlie Ebersol: You know the Orange Bowl, about 15 years earlier, was the first time we’ve ever seen professionals use it during an event. The thing was when they tried to use it, the NFL the NBA said they never allow a camera to fly above the field. So when the XFL came along, the big premise of the league was that this is a league created for television.Look, it proved it: Every piece of technology that was applied to the XFL is now standard. In 18 months, everyone was using that technology in the NFL, and I think that’s sort of been the definition of my father’s and Vince’s careers, that they were always the first to market this thing, and in doing so, they defined the market. When the XFL failed, it also revolutionized television broadcasting, so I weigh that against the larger picture.DE: This was never anything to replace football in the fall. We were never going to run football against the NFL. So it was never looked upon as a bad business risk by anybody, it was just an enormous, you could say, fun failure.Fun to be sure, but definitely a failure.DE: Saturday night was then as it is now, the least-watched night of the week for network television. The networks today average not even a 2 rating on Saturday night. We would have been happy then with a 5 rating.The very first [XFL] game was a 10 rating, which was higher than any Saturday night had been in more than a decade at that point. So it showed the anticipation for an interesting, new type of league. It showed players training for games as if there were Green Berets, and mortars going off on the field and everything. The public got so caught up in it, we probably ― we definitely ― over-hyped it.The quality of the football also was very poor. That made it very hard to continue selling, right? DE: I think enough of them would have stayed if the caliber of football was good. I figured that out by the end of the first quarter of the first game, that this was not going to work because of the quality of the football. And then it became how to shepherd this thing through the first season, knowing we would probably never get a second season. Is it simple enough to assume, then, that the league would have lasted had the actual football been better?CE: Absolutely. I would take this so far as to say, if they had not decided two weeks before the first game to broadcast the Vegas game and instead stuck with their original plan, which was the Orlando game ― which turned out to be like 37-34 [actually, it was 33-29] and was a barnburner with tons of touchdowns scored and violence.I think that the only thing that surprised me about the XFL is that it failed. I really felt watching the XFL, and I think most fans felt watching it, “Wow, they’re doing this crazy stuff. Why the hell is the NFL not doing this?” Yet even still, the league pushed so many envelopes. Was that a positive?CE: The marketing was their greatest strength and their greatest weakness. They did such a good job marketing, they just didn’t market the thing they were actually going to give people. So when people tuned in and the defensemen didn’t have folding chairs to hit the offensive players with ― I think there was a certain level of disappointment among the fans.I also would say that six months of the best marketing campaign, maybe, in the history of sports television [couldn’t compensate for only] one month of practice for the players to practice together.DE: By the halfway point of the season, it was setting all-time lows. How important was it for the XFL to establish itself as an entirely separate entity from the NFL? I mean, this was still pro football, but not what sports fans were accustomed to.CE: People forget that the NFL is a juggernaut now, but in 2001, they were really suffering. The league had become restricted in terms of what players were allowed to do and the quarterback was being treated like the Shah of Iran and no one was allowed to touch him. The [XFL] wanted a [different] version of football.They wanted this thing to have the bones of football, but they wanted to build out the rest of it to do something much more dynamic. They were willing to try new stuff in every single facet of the game.Like the customized player names? DE: Well, the names were something in theory that Vince was talking about months before the first game, but when we were about to play the first national television game, it was actually during the course of that day that those names were being created. So, the beauty of anything you do with Vince is that anything is possible at any time. In fact, we’d never had lawyers between us ― that’s how trusting we’d become of each other and still are today. Nothing that I’ve ever done with Vince has been more fun than humans should be allowed. We just have this relationship.One of the odder things I remember was the concept of a hot tub in the end zone full of strippers. CE: The XFL was really unique in the sense that the league owned all the teams. So everybody was an employee of the XFL.So, in each city, the GM had a lot of leeway because there were so many things going on at the league level, with teams having to figure out how to get people to come to games. So about halfway through the season, a mandate came down from WWE/NBC/XFL headquarters and they said, basically, “Push the marketing envelope, you can be controversial, knock yourself out.”The LA GM and his marketing person came up with the idea of putting a hot tub in the end zone.How was the idea received? CE: It started with cheerleaders, and they went to the head cheerleader and said, “Hey, we’re going to put this out there” and she was like, “No. My cheerleaders are professional dancers, and they’re not going to do that.”So they were like three days out [from the game] and didn’t know what to do, so they went to ― I swear to God, I think they went to the Spearmint Rhino ― and hired some girls to be in the hot tub. And the players didn’t know until they arrived at the game, and so a bunch of players told me later that they were like warming up and there were girls in an inflatable hot tub in one of the end zones.So many things, too, that could have gone wrong and did. It always felt like the league was snakebitten.DE: We just had a succession of things [and bad luck], including the second week with a huge game out in LA. The truck power failed and we lost the signal all the way across the country for like 20 minutes, and it turned out someone had forgotten to put gas in the generator. CE: In the middle of the league, they changed the rules. So all of a sudden, they had motion behind the line and a bunch of other things like that. Once they got to week four or five and the ratings really slipped to historic lows, they really tried just about everything, but I think they were incredibly unlucky.The league had already shown the viewers really crappy football, and the viewers weren’t going to come back ― they weren’t going to be fooled for a second time.From an individual standpoint, what did you struggle with or what challenged you during the documentary production?  CE: First of all, it was terrifying interviewing my father and Vince. Talking them both into doing the film was a funny shell game, which was Vince saying, “Yeah, I’ll do it if Dick does it,” and my dad saying, “I’ll do it if Vince does it,” and getting one of them to jump off the cliff first.I think the bigger challenge was trying to deliver an hour-and-a-half film. Our first cut was two and a half hours long and had the same pace as the final film. We wanted the film to convey the chaotic and hair-on-fire pace which really produced the league. That pacing of one thing after another after was an important choice for me, but it meant that we had to cut a lot of stuff out.As a whole, how rewarding was making this documentary for you? DE: The best thing about this show, other than having lived that part of my life, is that my son produced and directed it. Of all the things I’ve ever done in my career, there’s nothing I’m as proud of than seeing what he pulled off with this, because this is really first-rate entertainment and I’m overwhelmed that ESPN is as supportive of this as they are ― because I competed against ESPN for a very long time.“This Was The XFL” airs on ESPN on Feb. 2 at 9 p.m. Eastern.Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com, ask me questions about anything sports-related on Twitter at @Schultz_Report, and follow me on Instagram at @Schultz_Report."

We were never going to run football against the NFL. So it was never looked upon as a bad business risk by anybody, it was just an enormous, you could say, fun failure.Fun to be sure, but definitely a failure.DE: Saturday night was then as it is now, the least-watched night of the week for network television. The networks today average not even a 2 rating on Saturday night. We would have been happy then with a 5 rating.The very first [XFL] game was a 10 rating, which was higher than any Saturday night had been in more than a decade at that point. So it showed the anticipation for an interesting, new type of league. It showed players training for games as if there were Green Berets, and mortars going off on the field and everything. The public got so caught up in it, we probably ― we definitely ― over-hyped it.The quality of the football also was very poor. That made it very hard to continue selling, right? DE: I think enough of them would have stayed if the caliber of football was good. I figured that out by the end of the first quarter of the first game, that this was not going to work because of the quality of the football. And then it became how to shepherd this thing through the first season, knowing we would probably never get a second season. Is it simple enough to assume, then, that the league would have lasted had the actual football been better?CE: Absolutely. I would take this so far as to say, if they had not decided two weeks before the first game to broadcast the Vegas game and instead stuck with their original plan, which was the Orlando game ― which turned out to be like 37-34 [actually, it was 33-29] and was a barnburner with tons of touchdowns scored and violence.I think that the only thing that surprised me about the XFL is that it failed. I really felt watching the XFL, and I think most fans felt watching it, “Wow, they’re doing this crazy stuff. Why the hell is the NFL not doing this?” Yet even still, the league pushed so many envelopes. Was that a positive?CE: The marketing was their greatest strength and their greatest weakness. They did such a good job marketing, they just didn’t market the thing they were actually going to give people. So when people tuned in and the defensemen didn’t have folding chairs to hit the offensive players with ― I think there was a certain level of disappointment among the fans.I also would say that six months of the best marketing campaign, maybe, in the history of sports television [couldn’t compensate for only] one month of practice for the players to practice together.DE: By the halfway point of the season, it was setting all-time lows. How important was it for the XFL to establish itself as an entirely separate entity from the NFL? I mean, this was still pro football, but not what sports fans were accustomed to.CE: People forget that the NFL is a juggernaut now, but in 2001, they were really suffering. The league had become restricted in terms of what players were allowed to do and the quarterback was being treated like the Shah of Iran and no one was allowed to touch him. The [XFL] wanted a [different] version of football.They wanted this thing to have the bones of football, but they wanted to build out the rest of it to do something much more dynamic. They were willing to try new stuff in every single facet of the game.Like the customized player names? DE: Well, the names were something in theory that Vince was talking about months before the first game, but when we were about to play the first national television game, it was actually during the course of that day that those names were being created. So, the beauty of anything you do with Vince is that anything is possible at any time. In fact, we’d never had lawyers between us ― that’s how trusting we’d become of each other and still are today. Nothing that I’ve ever done with Vince has been more fun than humans should be allowed. We just have this relationship.One of the odder things I remember was the concept of a hot tub in the end zone full of strippers. CE: The XFL was really unique in the sense that the league owned all the teams. So everybody was an employee of the XFL.So, in each city, the GM had a lot of leeway because there were so many things going on at the league level, with teams having to figure out how to get people to come to games. So about halfway through the season, a mandate came down from WWE/NBC/XFL headquarters and they said, basically, “Push the marketing envelope, you can be controversial, knock yourself out.”The LA GM and his marketing person came up with the idea of putting a hot tub in the end zone.How was the idea received? CE: It started with cheerleaders, and they went to the head cheerleader and said, “Hey, we’re going to put this out there” and she was like, “No. My cheerleaders are professional dancers, and they’re not going to do that.”So they were like three days out [from the game] and didn’t know what to do, so they went to ― I swear to God, I think they went to the Spearmint Rhino ― and hired some girls to be in the hot tub. And the players didn’t know until they arrived at the game, and so a bunch of players told me later that they were like warming up and there were girls in an inflatable hot tub in one of the end zones.So many things, too, that could have gone wrong and did. It always felt like the league was snakebitten.DE: We just had a succession of things [and bad luck], including the second week with a huge game out in LA. The truck power failed and we lost the signal all the way across the country for like 20 minutes, and it turned out someone had forgotten to put gas in the generator. CE: In the middle of the league, they changed the rules. So all of a sudden, they had motion behind the line and a bunch of other things like that. Once they got to week four or five and the ratings really slipped to historic lows, they really tried just about everything, but I think they were incredibly unlucky.The league had already shown the viewers really crappy football, and the viewers weren’t going to come back ― they weren’t going to be fooled for a second time.From an individual standpoint, what did you struggle with or what challenged you during the documentary production?  CE: First of all, it was terrifying interviewing my father and Vince. Talking them both into doing the film was a funny shell game, which was Vince saying, “Yeah, I’ll do it if Dick does it,” and my dad saying, “I’ll do it if Vince does it,” and getting one of them to jump off the cliff first.I think the bigger challenge was trying to deliver an hour-and-a-half film. Our first cut was two and a half hours long and had the same pace as the final film. We wanted the film to convey the chaotic and hair-on-fire pace which really produced the league. That pacing of one thing after another after was an important choice for me, but it meant that we had to cut a lot of stuff out.As a whole, how rewarding was making this documentary for you? DE: The best thing about this show, other than having lived that part of my life, is that my son produced and directed it. Of all the things I’ve ever done in my career, there’s nothing I’m as proud of than seeing what he pulled off with this, because this is really first-rate entertainment and I’m overwhelmed that ESPN is as supportive of this as they are ― because I competed against ESPN for a very long time.“This Was The XFL” airs on ESPN on Feb. 2 at 9 p.m. Eastern.Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com, ask me questions about anything sports-related on Twitter at @Schultz_Report, and follow me on Instagram at @Schultz_Report."

In November 1987, The Federalist Paper published an unsigned editorial that argued against using college writings against public figures."

While the mainstream is slowly but surely widening its standards of beauty, high fashion runways are noticeably taking longer to adjust. Now the pressure to become more inclusive feels especially palpable. On Tuesday, 43 models wrote an open letter and an accompanying petition demanding diversity and safe health practices at New York Fashion Week later this month. As of Wednesday morning, over 1,000 other industry insiders and members of the public have signed it.Their “#DearNYFW” letter follows the publication of research that confirms what many people in the industry already know to be true: “that unhealthy weight control practices are a serious problem in the industry. Too often, models are being pressured to jeopardize their health and safety as a prerequisite for employment.”Published in partnership with the National Eating Disorders Association and the industry advocacy group Model Alliance, the letter and petition also call on designers to prioritize diversity ― an area that’s improved in recent seasons but is still a glaring problem.The demand is not specific to the inclusion of varied bodies, the letter notes, stating its authors will be looking out for “diversity of race, size, age, and gender status, and we hope to see diversity within and across all of those categories.”Body positivity advocate Iskra Lawrence, who has three million followers on Instagram, is among the 43 models who have signed the letter. The hope is that power in numbers helps spread the message.“Through our social media platforms, which collectively reach millions of people, we will recognize the industry leaders who step up to this challenge,” the letter reads.Also on the list are Sabina Karlsson, a model who walked in the Chromat and Christian Siriano shows last season, and Madison Schill, who left the modeling world in 2013 and serves as assistant producer on the upcoming body image documentary “Straight/Curve.”“I remember being afraid of going into my agency to grab comp cards during the hectic casting season ― afraid my hips would be too big, or that the steps I’d been advised to take in restricting my development would have shown up on my skin overnight,” Schill told The Huffington Post. “I don’t want other girls to have to go through that, I want them to realize that health is never something we should deny ourselves in order to book a show, and that they can be appreciated and loved and beautiful when they aren’t depriving themselves, too.” Here’s hoping designers keep the message in mind for many seasons to come.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story referred to Madison Schill as a producer of “Straight/Curve.” She is an assistant producer.

The measure will now move to the Senate, where GOP leaders are expected to quickly follow suit.Earlier this week, lawmakers in both houses announced bills to block the stream protection rule, an update to regulations that the Department of Interior finalized toward the end of President Barack Obama’s tenure. The update overhauled requirements for coal mining operations in order “to avoid mining practices that permanently pollute streams, destroy drinking water sources, increase flood risk and threaten forests.”The stream protection rule mandates testing and monitoring of waterways before, during and after mining operations, and requires companies that have used controversial practices like mountaintop removal mining to restore land to its “previous condition” after operations are finished. It updates regulations that were more than three decades old. The House also voted to overturn a Securities and Exchange Commission regulation, passed last June, called the “extraction rule.” The provision would require energy companies to disclose payments made to foreign governments for oil, gas and mineral developments and were intended to promote “greater transparency” among the sector. Fossil fuel interests rallied hard against the rule, including now Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who fought it while he was still the head of Exxon Mobil.Republicans, particularly those from coal states, strongly object to the new rules. Shortly after Obama signed the regulation, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) announced his plan to overturn the stream protection rule using the rarely invoked Congressional Review Act. The CRA grants Congress 60 days to vote to overturn executive branch regulations with a majority in both houses, with the approval of the president. That deadline is sometimes extended, and Congress may be able to roll back any law signed by Obama after mid-June of last year under some interpretations of the act.The act is rarely used except during transitions of power, as presidents would be unlikely to overturn a rule that they or a predecessor in the same party had already signed. President Donald Trump’s arrival in the White House, however, has given Republicans an opening. The CRA has only been used successfully once before ― to block a Clinton-administration ergonomics rule shortly after President George W. Bush took office. The New York Times notes that while congressional Republicans tried to use the CRA to nullify regulations five times during the Obama administration, Obama vetoed the legislation each time. McConnell lambasted nearly all of Obama’s environmental regulations, and called the stream protection rule “just one example of the former administration’s policies that have jeopardized jobs and taken power away from state and local governments in order to grow the federal bureaucracy.”“This regulation, like many others of the Obama era, does not take into account the negative consequences these policies would have on hardworking Americans and the families they support,” McConnell said in a statement this week.Scott Slesinger, legislative director at the Natural Resources Defense Council, disputed McConnell’s claims, saying the rule has had “virtually no impact on jobs.” He argued that Republicans are invoking the CRA simply so they can “show something on coal,” given Trump’s campaign promises to revive the industry. But the fuel isn’t as cheap, or as desirable, as it once was ― and that’s not because of the new regulations.“As everybody really knows, the number of jobs in the coal industry is not a factor of environmental rules, despite local claims to the contrary, but of the competitiveness of coal to natural gas,” Slesinger said. “It’s a myth that these are coal states anymore.”Coal production has fallen steadily since 2006 as cleaner-burning natural gas has become cheaper, according to the Energy Information Agency. Many industry analysts have expressed doubt about the fossil fuel’s resurgence as other leading coal users, such as China, have vowed to end their reliance on coal in an effort to tackle climate change.Congress is expected to overturn the rule regardless of those other concerns. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) sent out a press release ahead of Wednesday’s anticipated vote saying the rule “will” be overturned and calling it “an ineffective attempt to improve the environment as mines saddled with this regulation already have virtually no off-site impact.”“It’s just another way the unaccountable bureaucracy is imposing all pain for no gain,” he said."

There should be no doubt about that,” said one of the officials, who added that Iran is “absolutely not” violating that agreement, despite the missile test.The officials said Trump’s National Security Council and other agencies are reviewing the details of the missile launch, which they said violated a United Nations Security Council resolution prohibiting such tests. They said they would develop options for “an appropriate” response ― with the hope that none would be required.“What we sincerely hope is that the Iranians will take this notice and will cease that kind of behavior altogether,” a second official said.The officials would not specify what options are under consideration, or say whether they might include military force.“We do not want to be premature or rash or take any action that would foreclose options or unnecessarily contribute to a negative response,” the first official said.During his presidential campaign, Trump called the 2015 nuclear agreement “one of the dumbest deals ever made.” Last spring, speaking to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, he said that his “number one priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran.”"
68,POLITICS,Neil Gorsuch Was An Outspoken College Conservative With A Disdain For Activists,Sam Levine,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/neil-gorsuch-college_us_589242a4e4b0bf5206e5d97a,"As a Columbia University undergraduate in the 1980s, he complained the school had been taken over by liberals.",2017-02-01,"Neil Gorsuch, Donald Trump's pick to serve on the Supreme Court, was an outspoken conservative in college.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5892466218000067001110b7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In 1987, activists at Columbia University began a campaign to boycott Coors Brewing over its treatment of workers and the Coors family’s funding of conservative groups such as the Heritage Foundation. Posters popped up around the New York City campus urging students to reject Coors beer and The Federalist Paper, a conservative campus publication that activists claimed was funded by Heritage.The accusation irked Neil Gorsuch, an undergraduate who who helped found The Federalist Paper. “If we find out who did it, there’s a possibility of a libel suit,” Gorsuch told the Columbia Spectator, the campus newspaper, at the time. “I think the real issue is why these people are so fucking chicken and won’t put their names on this poster.” President Donald Trump on Tuesday tapped Gorsuch, a conservative judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, to fill a Supreme Court vacancy. A review of Gorsuch’s commentary during his time at Columbia shows he was an outspoken conservative even then. He wrote columns and granted interviews to the Spectator criticizing campus activism on issues that included divestment in South Africa, neighborhood gentrification, and military recruiters on campus. He frequently argued that Columbia had been taken over by liberals and was hostile to conservative viewpoints.In a 1987 column, for example, he accused Columbia students and faculty of rushing to embrace a liberal perspective without considering the alternative point of view or consequences. Divesting from South Africa, he argued, would hurt the school’s endowment, which supported its need-blind admissions policy.“Pro-divestment students call for the immediate withdrawal of University funds from all companies conducting business in South Africa. But in their haste to do the Right Thing, they are willing to overlook such mundane things as facts,” he wrote. “Namely, that many of these companies are themselves in the act of divesting. Committee and coalition members seem willing to sacrifice the large income from the endowment ― which goes to pay for our need-blind admissions policy, among other things.”In the same column, Gorsuch asked: “Why don’t we hear arguments that the modernization of our neighborhood might actually be good for the community?”“Is it because such arguments would be Immoral, False, and Heartless? Or is it because it is not fashionable at Columbia to be anything other than a pro-Sandinista, anti-Reagan, ADHOC, uraniumpilfering protester? Truth is: Columbia does have a moral responsibility. It has a moral responsibility to overcome the tyrannical atmosphere of ‘ideas’ that has so dominated life on Morningside for the last 20 years; it has a responsibility to make the political, philosophical, and ethical experience here as diverse and varied as the cultural and ethnic experience.”Gorsuch also argued in favor of intellectual diversity in 1986, when former United Nations Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick declined to accept an award on campus because of objections from Columbia faculty, students and staff. He added that students protesting Kirkpatrick were a “radical fringe element.”“The crux of this issue is why can’t we be open to an intellectual dialog with those with whom we disagree,” Gorsuch told the Spectator.As Gorsuch pushed conservatism on campus, an undergraduate activist named Jordan Kushner emerged as his liberal foil. It was Kushner whom Gorsuch accused of spreading the Heritage rumor. In a separate incident, Gorsuch said Kushner deliberately got arrested while protesting so he could get his picture in newspapers.“He was the the most prominent right-wing campus activist,” Kushner, now a civil rights attorney in Minneapolis, said in an interview with HuffPost. “We were obviously political rivals ― or not rivals, political enemies. We were on opposite sides.”Gorsuch was on the board of The Federalist Paper in 1987 when it published a story that said Kushner was dragged away by campus security while kicking and screaming near kegs of Coors beer in a grocery store. The Federalist Paper later partially retracted the story, but Kushner wrote a letter to the Spectator claiming the article was filled with “lies and distortions” and was authored by Gorsuch. Kushner said Gorsuch was embarrassed and apologized.Despite their different political views, Kushner said Gorsuch was always kind.“My memory of him personally was positive,” Kushner said. “He was very affable and cordial and personable and humorous and witty, and so my conversations with him were fun conversations. When his name first came out, I actually had fond thoughts about him because he was such a decent guy in person. But then the positions he took, including his defamations of me, started to sink in, and then I started to think about what was substantively relevant to the whole situation.”In 1987, Gorsuch wrote a column defending then-President Ronald Reagan during the Iran-Contra scandal. The administration secretly sold arms to Iran, which had been sanctioned with an arms embargo, and used the money to fund Nicaraguan militants, whose aid had been cut off by Congress. Gorsuch weighed in on the power of the president ― an issue he may have to examine if he is confirmed to the high court. He conceded that the affair was a mess, but argued Reagan was acting within his authority.“Jefferson, with his word alone, bought the whole of Louisiana and sent Louis and Clark off to explore it. More recently, FDR freely sent dozens of U.S. Navy vessels and arms to England before our entry into World War II,” Gorsuch wrote. “These presidents did not ask, nor did they need to ask, Congress, Sam Donaldson, or those precious presidential pollsters. Simply because members of Congress, news commentators, and folks at Columbia may not like Reagan’s action does not, believe it or not, make it illegal.”Early in his time at Columbia, Gorsuch ran for a seat on the University Senate, but was disqualified for breaking the school’s rule against putting up posters. The school newspaper asked candidates about military recruiting on campus. Gorsuch framed it as a First Amendment issue.“The question here is not whether ‘the Marines should be allowed to recruit on campus’ but whether a University and its community, so devoted to the freedom of individuals to pursue their own chosen lifestyles and to speak freely, has the right or obligation to determine who may speak on campus or what may be said,” Gorsuch told the Spectator. In the same interview, he said AIDS patients shouldn’t have to disclose their diagnosis.“It would be, to my mind, a violation of AIDS patients rights and privileges of privacy to demand that they report their illness,” he said. “I would hope, however, that the University will develop a positive and intelligent policy to ensure that all AIDS patients may receive competent medical attention.” Kushner said Gorsuch insisted to him during college that he was a moderate, but the positions he took showed otherwise.“He told me he was very moderate,” Kushner said. “I guess you take a look at the positions her took, like denouncing South African divestment, and you know the kind of nasty attacks he made on people engaged in protest. I don’t think the facts bear that out. “We’ve got a very appealing face covering up a right-wing agenda.”"
69,POLITICS,People Are Rushing To Get Critical Prescriptions Out Of Fear Over Obamacare Repeal,Julia Craven,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obamacare-repeal-prescriptions-stocking-up_us_5890cf56e4b0522c7d3d7375,It’s not just long-term birth control.,2017-02-01,Protesters gather outside Trump Tower on Jan. 13 to remind the president why Obamacare matters.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5890d2ac1700002f001d1760.jpeg?cache=zMjS64xrQo&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Vicki Murphy can’t afford to pay for her blood pressure medication if she loses the health insurance she obtained through the Affordable Care Act. That’s why the 55-year-old is planning to stock up on her medications now.In the first wave of health-related worry after the election of President Donald Trump, women rushed to get IUDs and other long-acting forms of birth control out of fear that the new administration would eliminate Obamacare’s birth control coverage.But an ACA repeal threatens more than reproductive care. Women around the country are trying to stockpile a range of medications and find substitutes for other treatments that allow them to function in their daily lives ― just in case the entire law is shelved and an adequate replacement isn’t enacted. People who enrolled for Obamacare coverage in 2017 should have insurance through the end of the year. But no one is sure what actions the Trump administration may take to undermine the program in the coming months. The president has already issued an executive order that could potentially weaken the ACA before repeal, leaving people worried and searching for alternatives. While some people stand to benefit from ACA repeal ― either because their premiums would decrease or they’re among the well-off who would get large tax cuts ― Murphy and other women who spoke with The Huffington Post won’t.A three-month supply of the blood pressure medication Murphy needs to reduce severe swelling in her legs has a market price of $157.99. She can’t afford that. “I live on just about $600 a month. That’s for rent, utilities and food,” said the Long Beach, California, resident. Without Obamacare, Murphy said she also can’t afford the physical therapy sessions she needs to alleviate back pain from a severe spinal injury. Her surgeon has even ordered her a back brace, she said, just in case.“When the ACA passed, I qualified for free Medi-Cal [Medicaid],” Murphy said. “It covers my medicine for blood pressure, cholesterol, physical therapy and my overall medical needs. If I lose my coverage, I will not be able to afford any of my medications. None of my doctors will say that I’m disabled [but] I’m only able to handle working for my parents for three to four hours, four or five days a week.”Medical decisions should be driven by current medical needs and conversations with health care providers instead of potential policy changes, said Dania Palanker, a health policy expert at Georgetown University.One risk in stockpiling medications, Palanker noted, is that the drugs that are the right choice for a patient today may not be tomorrow.Murphy was uninsured for more than five years before the ACA expanded Medicaid. The law has been critical to better health care for her and for many others. Researchers studying the impact of Obamacare have consistently found that people who obtained insurance under the ACA gained better access to care as well.Those gains haven’t always been huge, but they have been real ― as Megan Rodriguez can attest. On election night, Rodriguez started making plans to get some key medical needs addressed before Republicans could finalize a repeal.The 29-year-old Chicago medical student said she won’t be able to afford the prescription glasses she needs to see without insurance. She is also hoping to obtain a long-term form of birth control. “I’m really nervous and worried that they’re going to be able to take all of this away, so I’m trying to get as much done as quick as possible,” she said.“I don’t know when the next news update is gonna come that they’ve repealed some provision that I’m counting on or they’ve repealed the whole thing,” Rodriguez added. “It’s adding to my anxiety.” Rachel, a 37-year-old mother who lives outside Baltimore, said she is ordering an emergency 90-day supply of her medications, including anti-depressants. Her primary concern is that she won’t be able to afford the Adderall she needs to alleviate chronic fatigue.“When I didn’t have health insurance, [Adderall] costs me about $400 a month. And with my daughter — luckily she’s not on it now — but she had to be on a special formula that was $600 a month,” Rachel said. That’s a financial burden Rachel can’t handle herself. After her divorce, she said, she went without insurance that covered mental health costs for a year. The cost of her medical bills exceeded what she made that year, leading her to file for bankruptcy. She has never quite bounced back.“The times when I haven’t had the care I needed, I’ve gone into a lot of suicidal thoughts and making attempts even,” she said. “Obamacare saved people’s lives.”Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

70,POLITICS,Paul LePage Says There's No Way Republicans Will Repeal Obamacare,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-lepage-obamacare_us_5892576be4b070cf8b807a0b,The conservative Maine governor said the GOP won't take away the state exchanges.,2017-02-01,"Maine Gov. Paul LePage thinks Americans will be able to continue relying on the Affordable Care Act, despite GOP plans for a repeal.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/589258951c00002e004b84ba.jpeg?cache=r7DG5Meq4Y&ops=crop_0_153_3000_1790%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Maine Gov. Paul LePage (R) said he doesn’t think congressional Republicans will actually repeal the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, acknowledging that it would be too risky to upend the current system that people are already using.“I’m not sure you’re going to have anyone in Washington with the courage to repeal the ACA,” LePage, an outspoken supporter of President Donald Trump, said at a town hall meeting on Tuesday, according to Seacoast Online. “I do not believe for a minute that now that we have exchanges they will take them away.”LePage’s comments are an example of how much the talk around repeal has shifted since Republicans took control of both Congress and the White House. During the 2016 campaign, many Republicans called for an immediate repeal. Now, the party is dealing with the reality of putting a plan in place if Obamacare is scrapped so that people don’t lose coverage.Republican lawmakers are increasingly calling for caution on a repeal, saying it needs to happen simultaneously with a replacement plan.“I don’t think we can just repeal Obamacare and say we’re going to get the answer two years from now,” Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) said last month. “Look, this is a very complicated problem. Health care is a very complex issue. We haven’t coalesced around a solution for six years, in part because it is so complicated. Kicking the can down the road for a year or two years is not going to make it any easier to solve.”Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) said his office has been flooded with calls from people who are anxious about losing their health coverage if Congress repeals Obamacare.GOP governors are especially nervous, since their states have received significant federal resources under the Affordable Care Act ― most notably to expand Medicaid to more of their residents. “There’s room for improvement,” Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval (R) said recently, “but to repeal and not to replace, I just want to know what’s going to happen to all those people who find themselves left out in the cold.”LePage, whose state did not expand Medicaid access, also said on Tuesday that he believed “a one-payer system” was most likely. He did not elaborate on how that would happen. A single-payer system, which would be run by the government rather than private health insurers, has long been a dream for progressives, but it has not had any real momentum in Congress.The audience at the governor’s town hall included some supporters of a single-payer system, and Seacoast Online reported that the crowd burst into “spontaneous applause” when he mentioned it. LePage clarified that he did not support such a system.Want more updates from Amanda Terkel? Sign up for her newsletter, Piping Hot Truth, here."

Robinson, American Enterprise Institute Mr. Earl Matthews, Lt.

President Barack Obama held numerous meetings on criminal justice reform and the environment, for example. But those generally brought together local stakeholders ― public officials, business leaders, educators ― who could provide input on domestic policy.Ben Carson, Darrell Scott, Armstrong Williams, Paris Dennard, and Omarosa Manigault all played prominent roles on cable boosting Trump’s presidential candidacy. Lynne Patton, who is set to advise Carson at HUD, is the former vice president of Eric Trump’s charity, which suspended operations last month amid concerns over potential conflicts.In his public remarks at the meeting, the president vowed to work to improve wages and reduce violence in inner cities, which he called “terrible.” He turned to Carson, who will be tasked with housing policy, as someone who could address crime and violence.“It’s a big job. And it’s a job that’s not only housing, it’s mind and spirit,” Trump said.The president also paid tribute to some of the biggest names in the historical fight for civil rights, including Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, Abraham Lincoln, Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass. “Frederick Douglass is an example of somebody who has done an amazing job that is being recognized more and more, I noticed,” Trump said. When Scott, whose main church is in the Cleveland area, told Trump that Chicago’s top gangs had reached out to him seeking a “sitdown” with the president about decreasing the violence in that city, Trump sounded receptive. “I think it’s a great idea because Chicago is totally out of control,” he said. “They want to work with this administration,” Scott said of the gangs.“Good,” Trump responded."

After being elected in 1968, President Richard Nixon showed his support for cutting federal funding in half for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB). Rogers responded to the president’s proposal in 1969 with a passionate speech in front of the Senate’s Subcommittee on Communications.Speaking to chairman John Pastore, Rogers explained how he and his team operated on a budget of $6,000 for his show. According to him, that amount would cover less than two minutes of cartoons, or what he called animated “bombardment.” Rogers explained how he was “constantly concerned” about what kids saw on television and told Pastore he finished his program with an uplifting message for the children watching. “I end the program by saying, ‘You made this day a special day by just you being you. There’s no person in the whole world like you and I like you just the way you are,’” he said.The beloved host also made an important case for teaching children how to express feelings by sharing his song “What Do You Do With The Mad That You Feel?” with Pastore. “I feel that if we in public television can only make it clear that feelings are mentionable and manageable, we will have done a great service for mental health,” he said.February marks the anniversary of the first episode of “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood.” The beloved host’s moving speech also seems timely after The Hill reported that President Donald Trump plans to make cuts to CPB funding and eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts and National Endowment for the Humanities. Back in 1969, Rogers convinced Pastore of the importance of public programming. “Well I’m supposed to be a pretty tough guy,” Pastore said. “And this is the first time I’ve had goose bumps in the last two days.”Though the results weren’t instantaneous, Congress increased funds appropriated for the CPB to $23 million in 1971, compared to $5 million in 1969.

He remained vocal after former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election, and on Wednesday joined a group of House Democrats and civil liberty advocates at the steps of the U.S. Capitol to denounce the ban.“We will not be withdrawing. We will not be pushed back. We will remain standing. This country is with us,” Khan said in a fiery speech. “Don’t take me there yet, we are not willing to go that way yet. But this needs to stop. If it doesn’t stop here, the world is waiting to join us. We will boycott everything, and anything, Trump if this continues.”“Because of his malice toward Muslims, [Trump] has endangered their lives,” he added. “He has alienated patriotic Americans in the United States.” Democrats rushed to catch up with the anti-Trump fervor among their base this week, after a few party officials joined protests in the first week of his presidency. Democratic lawmakers joined protests at the nation’s airports, voiced their opposition from the steps of the Supreme Court, and even boycotted a Senate hearing on two of Trump’s Cabinet nominees.Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), who was the first Muslim elected to Congress and is now running for the chair of the Democratic National Committee, followed suit at Wednesday’s press conference.“If [Trump] can ban Muslims, he can ban Seven Day Adventists, he can Catholics, he can ban Jews. We’ve gotta take a stand right here, right now,” he said at the event, which was organized by the American Civil Liberties Union.Trump’s administration has continued to defend the ban ― which also halted all refugee admission ― in the name of national security. The president tweeted on Wednesday that it was “about keeping bad people (with bad intentions) out of country.”The likelihood of an American being killed in a terrorist attack caused by a refugee is 1 in 3.64 billion per year, according to the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank in Washington."

Instead, on Sunday, he scrapped the idea. As he watched protests break out across the country over President Donald Trump’s executive order on immigration, he decided to take the opportunity to tackle more pertinent subjects. Rademacher, who hails from Minneapolis, teaches mostly students of color. The past year has been tough for them. In July, a local police officer shot and killed Philando Castile during a traffic stop, highlighting already fraught tensions between police officers and minority communities. In recent weeks, amid the election of Trump, Rademacher has fielded worries from students about people getting deported, about an outbreak of war, about the national guard getting sent to Chicago and potentially disrupting the lives of family members. His students have continually expressed concerns over the value ― or seeming lack of value ― society places on their lives and experiences. On Monday, these anxieties only felt heightened, said Rademacher, whose students also include several Muslims.“To summarize the general feeling, it was: This is the beginning,” he said.“No student was looking at this weekend thinking, ‘This is the worst thing that’s going to happen.’ It’s more like, this is the first step, and they’re really worried about what comes next.”In the weeks following Trump’s election, teachers reported seeing higher rates of trauma and fear from immigrant students and students of color, according to a Southern Poverty Law Center report. On Monday, just a few days after Trump’s immigration order ― which halts the U.S. refugee resettlement program and temporarily bars people from seven countries from entering the U.S. ― teachers had to find ways to help students face these fears head-on. Some educators, like Rademacher, refused to let the concerns of pupils go unnoticed, turning them into teachable moments.Students in Rademacher’s classes spent Monday looking at a poem called “Home,” by British Somali poet Warsan Shire. The poem, which includes the famous line “No one leaves home unless home is the mouth of a shark,” has become a rallying cry against the immigration order. Rademacher focused the discussion around the lived experiences of refugees, taking pains to emphasize points of shared humanity. The aim, says Rademacher, was not to have students debate current events or convince them to feel a certain way, but to give students a space to share their worries, while looking at multiple perspectives.“I think especially in the leadup to the election, kids weren’t exactly hopeful about the future, and weren’t necessarily seeing the world as a positive place or great place for them,” said Rademacher. “That’s only gotten stronger, they only carry that heavier now.” At another Minnesota school, Mark Westpfahl’s middle school history classes have been thinking about these issues for weeks, even before Trump’s executive order. The kids are in the middle of a unit on immigration, which looks at European migration to America at the turn of the 19th century. For these students, Trump’s actions don’t just relate to abstract history in a textbook. Many of Westpfahl’s students come from immigrant families, some of them Somali. Under Trump’s order, Somalis are barred from entering the United States for the next 90 days. Kids spent some of Monday discussing the past weekend’s events. In the next few days, they will be drawing connections between Trump’s order and older, historical actions on immigration. Westpfahl hopes to help students look at other sides of the issue ― even those they may not intuitively agree with. Westpfahl said he plans to ask students questions like: What if kids from the classroom next door started using our space, desks and chalkboards? How would that make students feel?If students are able to see all perspectives, it will make them able to better advocate for whatever side they choose, Westpfahl hopes.But these classes have also paved the way for difficult, sometimes painful discussions. A number of students have told Westpfahl that they’re unsure of their immigration status, and they don’t know what is going to happen to their families. They say they’re scared.“Seeing my students have to go through it with that worry and concern and fear ― it pulls at you,” said Westpfahl. “The things we talk about often appear in just a textbook, but these are textbook examples from 50 years ago. What we are going to be learning and talking about years from now are the stories of these kids.”Whitney Scott-Jones, who teaches English as a second language in Texas, also scrapped the lesson she had planned for her sixth-grade students Monday amid Trump’s immigration order. Instead, she had her kids ― who come from a range of countries like Somalia, Kenya and Ethiopia ― make signs that emphasize pride in their heritage. She told them that they are welcome in America, that many citizens disagree with the president and that people know what great things they bring to the community. Scott-Jones says she wants the world to know how “wonderful” her students are.“How strong and courageous, how kind and considerate, how they’re just here, just wanting a better life, wanting to learn to read, to write, to make friends, play sports, get a good education, like any other American kid,” she said. ― ― Rebecca Klein covers the challenges faced in school discipline, school segregation and the achievement gap in K-12 education.

It compared that event with two of the worst days in American history: the attacks on Pearl Harbor and the World Trade Center.Hubbuch has since deleted the tweet, but a screengrab appears below:Hubbuch later sent out an apology tweet, also since deleted, calling the comparison of Trump’s inauguration to 9/11 “insensitive and wrong.” He added, “I shouldn’t have done it,” according to Philly.com.Contacted by The Huffington Post, Hubbuch declined to comment further. “Unfortunately, I can’t say anything more than my pinned tweet at this time.”The New York Post confirmed that Hubbuch was no longer employed there in a statement to ProFootballTalk.com. The statement suggested that the sportswriter’s tweet was not the sole reason for the paper’s decision:“We expect our reporters to interact with the public, including on social media, in a professional manner,” the Post said in a statement sent to PFT. “Unfortunately, Mr. Hubbuch has engaged in a pattern of unprofessional conduct and exhibited serious lack of judgment, including most recently showing disrespect for the victims of Pearl Harbor and 9/11.”Back in September, Hubbuch temporarily deleted his Twitter account due to backlash over another post, according to AwfulAnnoucing.com.

78,POLITICS,White House Makes Another Tweak To Trump's Ban On Refugees And Certain Foreign Nationals,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-ban-green-card_us_58925893e4b070cf8b807b98,Green card holders will no longer need waivers to enter the United States.,2017-02-01,President Donald Trump has said his refugee and travel ban is going great.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58925c271c00002e004b84cb.jpeg?cache=tsBhzvNVy7&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― It’s been less than a week since President Donald Trump signed a sweeping ban on certain foreign nationals and all refugees entering the U.S., but his administration has already had to make multiple tweaks to account for its vague language. The administration made another change on Wednesday. A counsel to the president issued guidance to government agencies saying the executive order does not apply to legal permanent residents, also known as green card holders, and that they will no longer need special waivers to re-enter the U.S. White House press secretary Sean Spicer announced the “update,” as he put it, during a daily briefing with reporters. Trump’s initial executive order, which he signed Friday, was phrased so broadly that it affected green card holders who had left the country only to find out later that the president had tried to block their return. The order bars most nationals of seven Muslim-majority countries ― Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen ― from entering the country for at least 90 days. It also suspends refugee resettlement for 120 days, and indefinitely blocks Syrian refugees from the United States.The ban was applied to legal permanent residents originally from those seven countries, many of whom were initially detained upon returning to the United States. More than 1,000 of them were admitted under special waivers. Now, based on the White House guidance, those individuals will not need a waiver. The Department of Homeland Security announced additional exceptions to the ban on Tuesday, including Iraqis who worked for the U.S. government in positions such as translators. Officials also said the ban does not apply to dual nationals of the seven countries. For example, someone with Syrian and French nationality can enter the U.S. using their French passport.The exceptions only apply to a small fraction of the population potentially affected by the order: tens of thousands of refugees and millions of citizens of the seven countries who are still barred from visiting the U.S. to work, study, see family or receive medical care. The initial language allowed for very few exceptions. Some Republicans particularly balked at the inclusion of legal permanent residents and Iraqis who assisted U.S. troops. Members of Congress said they received little guidance about the order, even after it went into effect. Trump has denied that there were any issues with implementing the order. “It’s working out very nicely,” he said Saturday. The latest change to the order came after Donald McGahn, counsel to the president, advised that there was “reasonable uncertainty about whether those provisions apply to lawful permanent residents,” Politico first reported."

The man was then killed at the national police headquarters, according to The New York Times, and officers extorted ransom money from his family by saying he was alive.Dela Rosa estimated that about 40 percent of officers are corrupt and as “lousy as drug lords,” Reuters reported.More than 7,000 people have died at the hands of police and others in extrajudicial killings since President Rodrigo Duterte took office last summer and announced a renewed focus on halting drug dealers and users. The irony of the no-holds-barred war on drugs is that it turned enforcers into criminals at least as bad as the people they aimed to punish.Dela Rosa announced that a counterintelligence force would be created to catch corrupt officers, the Los Angeles Times reported.“You policemen involved in syndicates, let’s see what happens now. Fight back so you’ll end up dead,” Dela Rosa said. “You will be killed by this counterintelligence task force.”Most of the drug eradication work will now shift to the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, which has a much smaller staff.“This is a momentary victory on your part,” Dela Rosa said, referring to drug kingpins. “Go ahead and enjoy, but there is always a time for reckoning.”The rogue cops are proof of a breakdown of the rule of law under Duterte, wrote Phelim Kine, Asian deputy director of Human Rights Watch, on the organization’s website. “Philippine police have good reason to believe that they can literally get away with murder,” Kine added. Duterte surged to power on the promise that he would rid the nation of drug dealers by killing them and dumping their bodies into Manila Bay.A self-confessed former assassin testified in September that Duterte had personally ordered extrajudicial killings — and, in one case while serving as mayor of Davao City, had pulled the trigger himself. Even Duterte has admitted that the police force is “corrupt to the core.” Still, he said he doesn’t plan to abandon his war on drug dealers."

A year ago, nearly 600,000 people signed a petition requesting that Trump, who was a presidential candidate at that time, be barred from entering the United Kingdom. "

Security Council resolution endorsing the pact.Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif spelled out Tehran’s stance after a U.S. official said Iran on Sunday test-launched a medium-range ballistic missile that exploded after 630 miles (1,010 km).In light of this, the United States requested the U.N. Security Council hold “urgent consultations” on Tuesday, after its scheduled session on Syria’s conflict.French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault told reporters in Tehran that had voiced its concerns over the Iranian test, adding that it harmed the international community’s confidence in Tehran and contravened Security Council Resolution 2231.That resolution ratified a July 2015 accord between Iran and six world powers under which Tehran curbed its nuclear activity to defuse concerns it could be put to making atomic bombs; in return, Iran won relief from crippling economic sanctions.Zarif neither confirmed nor denied the U.S. report that it tested a ballistic missile on Sunday but added: “The missiles aren’t part of the nuclear accords. Iran will never use missiles produced in Iran to attack any other country.”“No Iranian missiles have been produced to carry nuclear warheads,” said Zarif, speaking at a joint news conference held with Ayrault in Tehran. The Security Council resolution called on Iran not to carry out activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, condemned Iran on Monday and said he would work with other lawmakers and the Trump administration to hold Iran accountable. “COMMON INTEREST”Ayrault said at the start of his two-day trip to Tehran on Monday that France would act as a defender of the nuclear deal that new U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to tear up.“We hope that that question of Iran’s defensive program will not be used as a pretext for the new U.S. administration ... to provoke new tensions,” Zarif said.Ayrault added it was imperative the Islamic Republic abide strictly by the conditions of the accord. He said it was in the “common interest” that all sides heeded the deal.Ayrault is looking to reassure Tehran of France and Europe’s support for the nuclear deal, and to increase commercial ties. The deal was engineered two years ago by the United States, Russia, China, Britain, Germany and France.“This deal has to be rigorously kept to,” Ayrault said. “I want this deal to last and that no badly chosen initiatives are taken that could put the accord in jeopardy.”During the U.S. election race, Trump branded it “the worst deal ever negotiated”, telling voters he would either rip it up or seek a better agreement.Paris took one of the hardest lines against Tehran in the talks, but has been quick to restore trade relations since then.Major French corporations including planemaker Airbus (AIR.PA), oil major Total (TOTF.PA) and car companies Peugeot (PEUP.PA) and Renault (RENA.PA) have all signed contracts.Ayrault said trade between the two countries had surged by 200 percent since the July 2015 deal.He added that a deal between Turboprop maker ATR with IranAir for the sale of at least 20 aircraft was “practically sealed”, and that a contract with construction group Vinci (SGEF.PA) for two regional airports was also making progress.Ayrault also sought to reassure Zarif over the potential return to Iran of major Western banks, which have hesitated for fear of possible U.S. fines if they do business with Iran.“Some banks are reticent, but we are working on this,” Ayrault said.(Editing by Mark Heinrich)"

They made the announcement on Tuesday, following a period of confusion over the executive order that began when Trump signed it on Friday.Kelly also went to Capitol Hill to speak to members, who said as recently as Monday evening that they were unable to get information from the government about the order, and some Republicans joined Democrats in criticizing the inclusion in the travel ban of legal permanent residents and people who assisted U.S. armed forces in Iraq.The executive order puts a 90-day bar from entry on nationals of seven countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. It also halts refugee resettlement from all countries for 120 days and indefinitely blocks Syrian refugees from entering the United States.Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly announced Sunday that waivers would be provided on a case-by-case basis to legal permanent residents, also called green card holders. On Tuesday, he and other DHS officials announced additional exceptions to the order. Iraqi nationals will now be eligible for entry using Special Immigrant Visas, which are granted to people who worked for or on behalf of the U.S. government in Iraq, officials said. DHS officials also said that dual nationals with visas and passports from a non-restricted country are eligible to apply for entry into the U.S., such as someone with citizenship from Iran and Britain.Even after the changes, millions of people from the seven affected countries, along with all refugees not scheduled to enter the U.S. this week, are subject to the ban. Kelly insisted to reporters that he was kept in the loop about the order, contrary to reports that he found out about it at the same time it was signed. He said that in a sense everyone knew about the plan, since Trump had talked about it during his campaign.Members of Congress felt they were inadequately consulted, and his meeting with both House and Senate members left many with more questions than answers.Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who earlier in the day said he is bracing himself for more problems to emerge from the order, left the briefing with little to say and appeared troubled.“Uhh, it was somewhat insightful ― somewhat,” Corker told reporters after an abnormally long pause when asked if Kelly was reassuring.Asked if Kelly appears to have the situation under control now, after the chaotic weekend, Corker said the White House seems to think so and doesn’t plan to revise the order.“They feel like from their perspective they have it where they want it to be and are not expecting additional iterations,” Corker said, adding that he’s “not really in a place” where he wants to talk about if he thinks changes still need to be made.Senate Democrats came out of the briefing agitated.“Candidly, this briefing leaves me with a lot more questions,” Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) told reporters Tuesday evening.“I have never seen in all my years in government ― being the governor, senator ― actions like this that are so poorly thought through,” Warner added when asked if any concrete plan was shared with lawmakers on how the order would be carried out going forward.Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) said limited information was shared given the size of the briefing will all members, and not all questions were answered.“Kelly understands that this was not perfectly implemented [and] indicated that it could have been done differently,” McCaskill said. “But did state that the White House was the one insistent upon it being implemented immediately. So they did the best they could.”Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin said Kelly acknowledged that some of the things that happened in crafting the order and rolling it out “will never happen again.”Kelly gave the impression that the order was driven largely at staff level and from White House, but DHS knew it was coming, according to the Democratic senators.How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

85,POLITICS,"If Trump Wants To Get Tough On Trade, He Should Prioritize China, Study Says",Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-china-trade-jobs-report_us_588fe2e8e4b0c90efeffafba,"Opening up trade with China cost the U.S. 3.4 million jobs, according to a new report.",2017-01-31,Then-presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks in Mexico City in Aug. 2016. Trump is considering using a 20-percent import tax to get Mexico to fund the border wall.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/588fe65517000026002d96aa.jpeg?cache=G9KNKZb4EW&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump has made Mexico the central focus of his push to reform U.S. trade policy, singling out the neighboring nation Thursday with a proposed 20 percent import tax that the White House subsequently walked back.If Trump is truly committed to saving American jobs lost to unfair trade practices, though, reshaping trade with China should be the priority, according to a new report by the Economic Policy Institute, a progressive think tank.The report, authored by EPI senior economist Robert Scott, estimates that China’s admission into the World Trade Organization, which vastly expanded U.S.-China trade, cost the U.S. 3.4 million jobs from 2001 to 2015. Three-quarters of the losses ― 2.6 million jobs ― were in manufacturing, according to Scott’s analysis.“We need to be targeting the countries that generate the vast majority of our trade surplus: China, Japan and Germany,” Scott told The Huffington Post. “Mexico is not engaging in unfair trade,” he added. “We are an integrated North American economy, and Mexico helps us compete against China. So to the extent we discriminate against them, it is going to hurt, not help.”To come up with his figures, Scott first calculated the net U.S. goods trade deficit with China by industry, subtracting the value of American exports to China from Chinese imports to the U.S. over the period he examined. Using official data, he then estimated how many jobs it would take for those industries to generate the equivalent of that amount if the those goods were produced domestically instead.Within manufacturing, Scott found that trade with China displaced over 1.2 million computer and electronic parts-making jobs, 204,900 apparel jobs and 57,100 jobs in the steel and aluminum industries, among other affected sectors.Workers directly affected by trade with China typically must settle for lower-paying jobs. Displaced workers lost a total of $37 billion in wages in 2011 alone, according to a 2013 analysis by Scott that he cited in Tuesday’s paper. And that figure likely understates the impact, since the threat of offshoring to China also diminished the bargaining power of workers whose jobs remained in the United States. Scott’s findings are consistent with those of other studies. An August 2014 paper by MIT economists estimating that trade with China cost the U.S. 2 million to 2.4 million jobs from 1999 to 2011. A feature that makes Scott’s study stand out, though, is his inclusion of interactive digital maps showing the effect of the job displacement on every state and congressional district. The states hardest hit by these losses as a percentage of total state employment may come as a surprise. Oregon, California, New Hampshire, Minnesota and North Carolina lead the pack. The three most affected congressional districts are in California. The fourth-most affected district is in Texas and the fifth is in Oregon.Scott acknowledged that if trade with China had not opened up, some companies would have introduced automation or otherwise modernized their factories in ways that reduced employment anyway.But he insisted that without the goods trade deficit there would nonetheless be millions more domestic jobs than there are now. “There has been productivity growth in manufacturing for generations,” he noted, which is often the result of technological upgrades. But those changes did not result in such precipitous employment drops until recently, he said. Scott’s paper is not an argument against trade with China ― or any other country ― however. He instead points to myriad ways that China games the international trade system to give an unfair advantage to its products, and Scott calls for taking a tougher stance on its tactics.The accusations are by now familiar. China subsidizes its manufacturing exports, allowing its companies to “dump” goods overseas, or sell them at below-market prices. Its system of subsidies also encourages Chinese firms to maintain excess production capacity that in turn creates an incentive to dump goods. And China’s longstanding policy of stockpiling U.S. Treasury bills and other foreign assets to devalue its currency has allowed its companies to suck up massive market share, Scott argued.Many economists claim that China has stopped artificially devaluing ― or “manipulating” ― its currency in recent years. But Scott and others, including Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, maintain that the Chinese central bank’s massive reserves of foreign assets, including U.S. bonds, continue to depress its currency.In the short term, Scott recommends that Trump immediately bring dumping cases against China at the U.S. International Trade Commission, where those claims can be processed faster than at the WTO. Like many progressive experts, Scott is cautiously optimistic that Robert Lighthizer, Trump’s pick for U.S. trade representative, who is a staunch critic of Chinese trade policies, will be willing to press these cases judiciously.Trump can also use the threat of tariffs on Chinese imports to pressure China to scale back excess production and take measures to dramatically reduce the value of its currency, such as selling its Treasury bonds. The U.S. could then broker a multilateral agreement to boost China’s currency that included Japan and other nations that Scott said also devalue their currencies to compete.In the long term, Scott believes that the president should work with Congress to rewrite U.S. trade law, much of which was written before China’s rise as a global trade power and does not give the U.S. government adequate enforcement powers.One thing the U.S. cannot wait for, according to Scott, is for American companies to take on China’s trade policies on their own. American companies that produce in China are already too dependent on Chinese subsidies and incentives to stand up to the government, he argued.“It is a case where we have a conflict between what is in the interests of the United States and in the interests of the companies, who we have in the past relied on to bring these cases,” Scott said. “That’s the reason we need the government to intervene.”"

He was 91.The Associated Press reported Monday that game maker Bandai Namco, which includes the company Nakamura founded in 1955, confirmed his death, which occurred Jan. 22. Company officials did not reveal a cause, The New York Times reported. Nakamura’s company, Namco, introduced “Pac-Man” in 1980, as the video game industry was in its infancy. The game became an instant hit with arcade players, who enjoyed racking up points by moving a chomping, circular Pac-Man around a board with an insatiable appetite to eat gold balls and elude ghosts. Versions of “Pac-Man” were later made for home-gaming systems like Nintendo. Its popularity led to “Pac-Man”-themed merchandise and apparel, a short-lived animated television series, and spinoff games like “Ms. Pac Man.”Nintendo, which worked with Namco for years, tweeted a tribute to Nakamura on Monday. Nakamura Manufacturing originally operated mechanical rides at a Tokyo department store. The company, later renamed Namco, partnered with the retail chain that wanted children’s rides in all of its locations. In the 1970s, Namco delved into video games with “Galaxian,” a shooter game, and acquired Atari Japan.Namco engineer Toru Iwatani invented “Pac-Man,” but it was reportedly Nakamura who came up with the name. Pac is short for “pakku,” which in Japanese denotes a munching sound.The A.V. Club reported an alternate history of the game’s creation. It said Nakamura renamed the creation “Pac-Man” after recognizing that the original title, “Puck Man,” would inevitably lead vandals to deface the arcade game by replacing the P with an F. In 2005, Namco merged with Bandai, forming a huge company specializing in toys, video games, and amusement facilities. It reported sales of 575.5 billion yen in 2016 ― more than $5 billion by the current exchange rate. Nakamura held an honorary position with the company until his death, C-Net reported. Nakamura, born in 1925, studied shipbulidng at the Yokahama Institute of Technology. "
87,THE WORLDPOST,Austria Will Ban Full-Face Veil In Public Places,Nick Robins-Early,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/austria-face-veil-ban_us_5890c8cee4b0c90eff006675,A number of European countries are planning similar bans as far-right parties gain support.,2017-01-31,"Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern and Vice Chancellor Reinhold Mitterlehner at a news conference in Vienna on Jan. 30, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/589105ab17000030001d18dd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Austria plans to institute a ban on wearing full face veils in public as part of a series of reforms to shore up support for the country’s coalition government.The ruling Social Democratic Party, along with the Austrian People’s Party, worked on the 35-page package of proposals that Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern announced with his vice chancellor on Monday. “We are committed to an open society, which also presupposes open communication. A full-face veil in public places stands in its way and will therefore be banned,” the document states.Austria’s ban represents an attempt to cater to supporters of the populist right-wing Freedom Party, which saw its candidate lose in last month’s presidential election but still has significant support in the polls.It also makes Austria the latest country to embrace policies closely associated with Europe’s rising anti-immigrant, anti-Islam parties. In addition to banning full-face veils, the reforms will restrict foreign workers and add new requirements for people to receive asylum in Austria.Critics of the face veil ban, like Ibrahim Olgun, president of Austria’s Islamic Faith Community, said it would undermine the relationship between the Austrian government and Muslims.However, a number of other European countries ― especially where anti-immigrant or anti-Islam parties are gaining support ― are considering similar face veil bans.The Netherlands is currently considering legislation for a partial ban on full face coverings that its lower house of Parliament approved last November. The niqab and burqa would be banned in certain public institutions, including schools, hospitals and government buildings, as well as on public transport. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte’s party backed the ban. Earlier this month, Rutte wrote an open letter telling people in the Netherlands to “act normal or leave.”Observers saw the letter as a fairly transparent attempt to court populist right-wing voters ahead of parliamentary elections in March.Dutch polls show that anti-Muslim politician Geert Wilders’ party is expected to gain a significant portion of the vote, although the Netherlands’ multi-party system makes it very unlikely it will actually govern. Wilders, who is sometimes compared to U.S. President Donald Trump, praised Trump’s Muslim ban on Tuesday.In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel announced last December that she would back a face veil ban “wherever legally possible.” Merkel is aiming to secure a fourth term as chancellor later this year, as the far-right Alternative for Germany party gains support on an anti-immigration platform.Some areas of Switzerland have also banned face coverings, and Belgium has had a full face veil ban in place since 2011. France instituted a full face veil ban for public places the same year, and last year, some French mayors passed bans on full-body swimsuits. These so-called “burkini bans” were overturned in France’s highest court after lawyers argued they were unconstitutional and discriminatory. Meanwhile, Austria’s plan to partially ban full face veils could go even further. The country’s minister of foreign affairs and integration, Sebastian Kurz, stated earlier this month that he favored a ban on headscarves for public servants.An estimated 100 to 150 women in Austria wear full face veils out of a population of around 8.5 million people."
