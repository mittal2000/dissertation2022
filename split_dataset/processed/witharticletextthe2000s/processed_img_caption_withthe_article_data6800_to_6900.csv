Chicago, the nation’s third largest city, is poised to be one of those climate leaders.Trump announced in June that the United States would pull out of the Paris Agreement, a nonbinding accord to reduce carbon emissions signed by nearly every country. He claimed the agreement would hinder economic growth and take jobs away from Americans.Hundreds of mayors immediately came out against Trump’s decision, pledging that their cities would still work to meet the goals laid out in the climate change pact. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel (D) was one of the dissenting voices.“The President’s decision to pull out of the Paris Accord is a poor attempt to pit environmental protection and economic growth against each other,” Emanuel said at the time. “It’s a false choice. Chicago has proven you can create jobs while reducing your carbon footprint, and we will continue to do both.”This week, Emanuel reaffirmed his city’s commitment to address climate change, even as the Trump administration took another step toward doing nothing.The Environmental Protection Agency proposed a rulemaking on Tuesday to abandon the Clean Power Plan, a move that would make good on Trump’s promise to scrap President Barack Obama’s signature rule curbing emissions from coal-fired power plants and focusing more on renewable energy. “The war on coal is over,” EPA chief Scott Pruitt said at an event with Kentucky coal miners the previous day.Emanuel drew the line again. “The Trump Administration’s attempt to roll back the Clean Power Plan is shortsighted and does not make climate change any less real,” he said.The mayor’s stand is backed by Chicago’s recent history. Over the past 20 years, the Windy City has made strides toward wasting less energy and worked to transition to renewable sources such as solar and wind. A better bike lane network across the city is just one of the more visible aspects of the city’s changes.In the 1990s, Mayor Richard M. Daley vowed to revamp Chicago’s image ― from a city trapped by Rust Belt decay to the “greenest” in the country. By the time his 22-year run as mayor ended in 2011, Chicago had planted more than 600,000 trees and developed more than 7 million square feet of planted roofs, the most of any U.S. city at the time.Emanuel built on his predecessor’s work, streamlining and coordinating existing initiatives. In 2012, he launched Retrofit Chicago, an effort to reduce energy use in public and private buildings, municipal operations and residences. This year, the program earned the city an Energy Star Partner of the Year Award, bestowed by the EPA and the U.S. Department of Energy.As of 2015, Chicago had already reduced its carbon emissions by 11 percent from 2005 levels, which is nearly halfway to the city’s Paris Agreement goal of a 26 percent reduction by 2025. The city managed this even as it saw a 7 percent increase in jobs.In April of this year, Emanuel said that all public buildings in the city would be powered by 100 percent renewable energy by 2025.Energy policy experts lauded Chicago’s efforts to reduce carbon emissions, although they pointed out there’s still more the city can do. Chicago is doing “a pretty good job,” said Jessica Collingsworth, a Midwest energy policy analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists.Targeting energy efficiency makes sense since 70 percent of the city’s emissions in recent years have come from its aging residential, commercial and industrial buildings.“It’s the best, the fastest, the cheapest and most environmentally sound way to reduce carbon pollution,” said Howard Learner, executive director of the Environmental Law Policy Center, a Midwestern legal advocacy organization.But Learner thinks Chicago could be more aggressive in its goals. With Illinois producing abundant wind and solar power, he’d like to see all municipal buildings in the city powered by renewable energy by 2022 ― three years ahead of schedule.Before Chicago pledged to meet the emissions goals outlined in Paris, Collingsworth said the city had its own Climate Action Plan ― but that hasn’t been updated since 2010. She also noted that the city could improve its public transit system beyond the Loop business district and the affluent North Side.Chicago could also expand its focus on cycling, Collingsworth said. Although Bicycling magazine named it the most bike-friendly U.S. city in 2016, partly for its bike-sharing program and new park and trail system, she said some bike lanes are not as visible as they should be to both cyclists and drivers. She’d also like to see bike-sharing made more available throughout the city.Emanuel’s sustainability office did not immediately respond to questions about these critiques.Of course, there are limits to how far the city can cut its energy use. Chicago’s weather extremes, particularly in winter, are challenges that cities in more temperate climates don’t face. And it is shouldering billions of dollars of debt, in part of the city’s own making and in part caused by the state going two years without a budget, Collingsworth said.Looking ahead, implementation of the state’s Future Energy Jobs Act should offer a big boost to Chicago’s sustainability efforts, according to Collingsworth, Learner and Mohammad Shahidehpour, a professor at the Illinois Institute of Technology who focuses on sustainable energy integration. Among other key steps, the Future Energy Jobs Act will create a community solar program to allow entire neighborhoods to enjoy the benefits of solar energy, provide job training and help people pay for efficiency upgrades through their utility bills. Learner said it could also drive renewable energy and efficiency investments, to the tune of 3,000 megawatts of additional solar energy and 1,350 megawatts of additional wind power in Illinois.In December, Chicago will host the North American summit of the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, where municipal leaders from the U.S., Canada and Mexico will discuss their commitments to the Paris Agreement and announce city-specific climate programs and policies.Learner wants to hear how the mayors of Chicago and elsewhere will match their deeds to their words.To reduce the carbon emissions that drive climate change, he said, “We want to see those words be followed up with actions that produce strong meaningful results.”"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59de6ce22d0000265e309d2d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Mandy Gonzalez belongs to an elite group of performers who can casually ask Lin-Manuel Miranda for an original song and feel confident he’ll deliver.The Broadway singer-actress, 39, has enjoyed a working relationship with Miranda for more than a decade. In 2005, she starred in the Off-Broadway incarnation of the Emmy-, Grammy- and Tony-winning “Hamilton” composer’s breakthrough musical, “In The Heights,” as Nina Rosario, and reprised her role three years later when the show moved to Broadway. She made the leap into “Hamilton” in September 2016, and has been thrilling New York audiences as Angelica Schuyler since then.So when it came time for Gonzalez to record her debut solo album, she knew she had to collaborate with Miranda, who is currently one of Broadway and Hollywood’s hottest commodities, once more.“I feel like my voice is synced with Lin after doing so many projects together, so I just called him,” she said. “I said, ‘Lin, I’m putting together an album, here’s what I’m thinking, and I wouldn’t want to have my voice out there without something written by you.’ His heart and soul is in everything he writes.”The result is “Fearless,” a pop and R&B-tinged anthem inspired, in part, by a social media effort Gonzalez launched in May after she posted a photo with her “Hamilton” co-stars with the hashtag #FearlessSquad on Twitter and Instagram.Watch Gonzalez perform “Fearless.” Story continues below. “So much of what is happening in the world right now is fear-based,” she said. “A lot of my followers wanted to have a place where they could gave a sense of belonging, a place where they could have a support system.” The original image racked up over 5,500 likes on Instagram and has since “turned into something more incredible than I could have imagined,” she explained. “I wouldn’t be where I am today without my fearless squad, so I wanted people who didn’t have one to feel like they could have one.”Before she hit the studio, Gonzalez shared her parents’ love story with Miranda, who then incorporated references to their relationship into the song’s lyrics. Her California-born Jewish mother began corresponding with her father, a Mexican American migrant worker, as pen pals during the Vietnam War. They’ve since been together for 45 years.Gonzalez’s uniquely American background is another reason she’s proud to count Miranda, who is of Puerto Rican descent and has written his musicals for racially diverse performers, among her “fearless squad.”“Lin has opened so many doors, because he’s written our story,” she said. “I’ve opened the door for other Latinas, but I also respect [stars like] Priscilla Lopez, Rita Moreno, Chita Rivera, who’ve opened the door for me in the theater world. It’s because of them that audiences see us as people with stories everybody can identify with.”Gonzalez’s album, which is also titled “Fearless” and due out Oct. 20, features music by Jennifer Nettles, Tom Kitt and Bill Sherman, who serves as her musical director. Four days after the release of “Fearless,” Gonzalez will kick off a two-week residency at New York’s Café Carlyle, where she’ll perform many of the new songs live for the first time. She said she feels “ready” to make her Carlyle debut, joining Elaine Stritch, Bobby Short and other stars who’ve taken the stage at the iconic supper club.“When you move to New York, it’s the place you want to play,” she said. “I’m sure that my father, who worked in the fields, never thought he’d have a daughter [on Broadway]. I want people to see my name, Gonzalez, and know that it’s from a long line of hard workers, and I worked very hard to be there.”She added, “Being fearless, to me, means going after what moves your heart. I’m not afraid to fall because I have a lot of love that surrounds me.”“Fearless” is due out Oct. 20. "

The United States. So, with 28 states and Washington D.C. having legalized medical cannabis, why or how is it federally illegal? This is because the government is allegedly controlling commerce, using a controversial 1942 decision Wickert v. Filburn as their excuse. Wickert v. Filburn has long been attacked by the far right as infringing on the rights of the states.Satirist Paul Kramer’s position about states’ rights not just being for racists anymore was confirmed by the dissents in Gonzalez v. Raich by Sandra Day O’Connor, then-Chief Justice Rehnquist and Associate Justice Clarence Thomas. The case in the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) could have been a landmark trial in affirming a human’s right to use cannabis as a medicine.Instead, the SCOTUS decision in Gonzalez v. Raich overturned its victory in the 9th Circuit court. The decision enjoined the government from arresting brain cancer patient Angel Raich for growing and using cannabis to treat her symptoms, in California where it is and was legal at the time.Allegedly, the government attorneys informally told her and her attorneys that they would not go after patients, just growers and dispensaries. The Obama Administration amended this policy to only enforcing federal cannabis in states that were not well regulated (2009’s Ogden Memo).In 2014 the Rohrbacher-Farr budget amendment was passed allocating no money to enforce federal cannabis laws in states where medicinal cannabis was legal. This budget amendment has been passed in each subsequent year. On June 26, the Senate Appropriations Committee renewed the budget amendment that blocks the Justice Department from undermining state medical marijuana laws. The amendment passed by voice vote, and individual votes were not recorded. Voice votes are normally used for non-controversial issues.However, the amendment has yet to be included in the final appropriations bill for 2018. Republicans in congress have successfully voted to prevent a vote to renew Rohrbacher-Farr, putting the cannabis industry into a very uncertain place. This is a small victory for anti-cannabis attorney general Jeff Sessions. Sessions’ position is confusing because as an aggressive supporter of states rights, particularly to suppress the rights of African Americans, one would assume that he would support the exercise on states rights. Nevertheless, Sessions personally requested that Congress eliminate this amendment. Apparently, the federal department wanted to prosecute medical marijuana patients.It is hard to see how a states’ rights supporter such as Sessions can take this position, expanding federal power at the expense of the state, but never be surprised by the lengths a man shrouded in bad ideology would go to protect it."

Candidate at Georgetown University Law Center. Imagine waking up tomorrow and having to flee your home with only the food and supplies you can carry, not knowing when or if you will ever be able to return. Your homeland could be a paradise: its climate dips into lush tropical temperatures, and its mountain ranges soar to beautiful heights. But as a displaced person, heavy rains and heat slow your escape, and the mountains become a death trap, stranding thousands of your people without food. No matter how dangerous escape is, you can’t go back: there is only “fires, bullets, knives” from where you came. So, you keep forcing yourself forward, stumbling onwards for miles over rough terrain. There is no end in sight, and the hope of finding safety as a refugee beyond your own borders seems idealistic at best. This situation is playing out in the lives of hundreds of thousands of people fleeing Myanmar. Conflict has erupted in Mynamar's Rakhine state. The government is driving out members of the Rohingya minority: more than 200 villages have been burned and refugees have recounted harrowing stories of mass murder and rape.Desperate for survival, the Rohingya people are fleeing into Bangladesh. Waiting for them there is the World Food Programme (WFP), the largest humanitarian organization fighting hunger. After a physically treacherous escape involving crowded boat rides across rain-swollen rivers and exhausting treks through swampy fields, the rice and high energy biscuits provided by the WFP begin to restore energy: for children, the elderly, and the injured, these supplies could be the difference between life and death. At the WFP camps, refugees finally have access to food, water and shelter after the horror they have been through. Many have lost family members and loved ones back in Myanmar; food can now prevent more casualties. Young children receive Supercereal plus, which helps fight off potentially deadly malnutrition. In a conflict like this, getting food aid to the very young is especially crucial, as their future depends on timely aid to prevent the irreversible effects of malnutrition.We must support the oppressed Rohingya minority, and the first step now is humanitarian aid.History has demonstrated, time and time again, the desperate need for humanitarian aid that arises during massive internal conflicts and refugee crises. In 1999, President Bill Clinton responded to the ethnic cleansing of Albanian Muslims in Kosovo not only with promises of military action, but with a pledge to increase U.S. funding for food and supplies delivered to the Albanian refugees, stating “Just as important (as military readiness), we need to sustain humanitarian relief and support.” That statement was delivered in response to war atrocities unfolding in “Europe’s backyard:” the western Balkans. Myanmar is farther from the United States geographically, and perhaps this distance makes it easier to ignore the humanitarian crisis erupting in Rakhine.Now is the time to look beyond our borders and ask ourselves how we can best use our resources to fight a growing humanitarian nightmare. We must not abandon those in need today.The World Food Programme and its partners must get the funding needed to provide supplies for this fast-growing refugee crisis. This emergency is another reason for Congress to support increasing our international aid budgets, including Food for Peace, the McGovern-Dole global school lunch program, Feed the Future and other initiatives.The tragedy and hunger in Myanmar is one of many crises across the globe currently. Four nations (South Sudan, Nigeria, Yemen and Somalia) are on the brink of famine and demand massive resources as well.The scale of the crisis in Myanmar can be daunting: in the face of suffering so great, it is easy to feel paralyzed and ineffective. Thankfully, history has provided us with examples of humanitarian aid alleviating crises, and groups like the WFP are already working to provide food and aid supplies to Rohingya victims on the ground. It is now up to us to support their efforts in any way that we can.We must feed the hungry refugees and strive for a settlement of the conflict so the Rohingya people can be free from fear and want."

In a conflict like this, getting food aid to the very young is especially crucial, as their future depends on timely aid to prevent the irreversible effects of malnutrition.We must support the oppressed Rohingya minority, and the first step now is humanitarian aid.History has demonstrated, time and time again, the desperate need for humanitarian aid that arises during massive internal conflicts and refugee crises. In 1999, President Bill Clinton responded to the ethnic cleansing of Albanian Muslims in Kosovo not only with promises of military action, but with a pledge to increase U.S. funding for food and supplies delivered to the Albanian refugees, stating “Just as important (as military readiness), we need to sustain humanitarian relief and support.” That statement was delivered in response to war atrocities unfolding in “Europe’s backyard:” the western Balkans. Myanmar is farther from the United States geographically, and perhaps this distance makes it easier to ignore the humanitarian crisis erupting in Rakhine.Now is the time to look beyond our borders and ask ourselves how we can best use our resources to fight a growing humanitarian nightmare. We must not abandon those in need today.The World Food Programme and its partners must get the funding needed to provide supplies for this fast-growing refugee crisis. This emergency is another reason for Congress to support increasing our international aid budgets, including Food for Peace, the McGovern-Dole global school lunch program, Feed the Future and other initiatives.The tragedy and hunger in Myanmar is one of many crises across the globe currently. Four nations (South Sudan, Nigeria, Yemen and Somalia) are on the brink of famine and demand massive resources as well.The scale of the crisis in Myanmar can be daunting: in the face of suffering so great, it is easy to feel paralyzed and ineffective. Thankfully, history has provided us with examples of humanitarian aid alleviating crises, and groups like the WFP are already working to provide food and aid supplies to Rohingya victims on the ground. It is now up to us to support their efforts in any way that we can.We must feed the hungry refugees and strive for a settlement of the conflict so the Rohingya people can be free from fear and want."

He was 2.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59dbd12c200000654d085e10.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"War was all 2-year-old Adnan had ever known. Born and raised in Syria’s Idlib province, the little boy’s first years of life were marked by food shortages, suicide bombings and inadequate medical care.Last week, Adnan had developed a cough and looked fatigued, his aunt, Amal Mohammed, told HuffPost. Fearing her son might have come down with a cold, Adnan’s mother took the boy to the doctor Sunday morning.On their way home, they stopped at the Maaret al-Numan market, one of the busiest outdoor fruit and vegetable markets in the province. Adnan’s father and three siblings were waiting for them at home. Then the airstrike hit. The blast tore Adnan from his mother, Mohammed said. The impact of the blast killed him instantly.“His siblings are in disbelief over the loss of their baby brother,” Mohammed said. “Every day there is an attack on a market or a hospital. The situation goes from bad to worse. We are exhausted and terrified. Every day, we live in fear.” HuffPost is withholding Adnan’s last name and his mother’s name ― and has changed his aunt’s name ― for safety reasons, as both families are still trapped inside Idlib. Sunday’s airstrike killed at least 11 civilians, including two children, according to the U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an organization that gathers data and reports from inside Syria.The death toll from the bombing is expected to rise amid ongoing efforts to recover the dozens of people still missing after the bombardment. SOHR believes the strike was carried out by Syrian regime warplanes.Photos and videos from the market show destruction where there had once been produce stalls, shoppers and cart owners. Vehicles at a taxi stand are burned down to bare metal.“This is a vegetable market. There are no terrorists positions here. I saw a man burning in his car and another had his head blown off,” a Syrian man told the Syrian Media Action Revolution Team, a France-based, Arabic-language opposition media network on the ground in Syria. Idlib and the surrounding areas serve as strongholds for opposition groups fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, which makes the region a frequent target for regime strikes. Idlib city is currently controlled by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, Syria’s former al Qaeda affiliate. Civilians are often caught in the middle of the intense fight. Almost 100 civilians were killed by regime strikes there just last month, according to SOHR. Thousands of families have fled the region over the past month to areas less exposed to daily bombing and shelling by the regime. The United Nations estimates that up to 1 million people are internally displaced in the region. Multiple hospitals in the region have been repeatedly targeted, killing medical professionals and patients alike. Medical charities such Doctors Without Borders have been forced to close due to the constant shelling. Humanitarian groups cannot make it into the province to deliver crucial aid to civilians, thus driving up the prices of local produce ― like the goods being sold at the Maaret al-Numan market on Sunday.Civilians in the region face threats on both fronts of the war. Militant groups like Tahrir al-Sham employ brutal tactics, kidnapping civilians and carrying out car and suicide bombings, according to a recent U.N. report. Among militant groups, infighting for control has intensified over the last three months, resulting in a dramatic rise in internal displacements.The same report also describes constant shelling of the area by government forces and occasional chemical weapon attacks against civilians. On April 4, Syrian warplanes dropped chemical bombs on the town of Khan Skeihoun, killing more than 70 people. The majority of the victims were women and children. The government is also accused of besieging several towns, cutting off food, health items and other essential supplies. The report notes that government sieges have “affected civilians more tragically than any other tactic.” Frustrated with the international inaction over the war crimes occurring in Idlib and other parts of Syria, U.N. chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte resigned shortly after the release of the report.Amal Mohammed says she, like many others, is desperate to flee Idlib but fears being targeted in an airstrike or kidnapped along the way. She says she doesn’t have enough money to pay a smuggler for herself and her two children.“Our world is destroyed in Idlib,” she said.For the Mohammed family, the difficult process of mourning Adnan has just begun.This isn’t the first life the war took from this family, Mohammed told HuffPost. Adnan was named after his uncle, who was also killed in regime strikes in Aleppo during the beginning of the war in 2012. The elder Adnan was protesting the Syrian regime when the government responded with force. He was 27. To honor him, Mohammed named her own son Adnan, and her brother named his baby the same.“We are so afraid for our kids. We are confused and at our wit’s end as to what to do now,” Mohammed told HuffPost. “We lost two Adnans in this war. We lost others. We pray we don’t lose any more family members.” "

Today I was honored to join an event",2017-10-11,"<p>Mary Anne Hitt, Michael Bloomberg, and Michael Brune join Sierra Club staff and volunteers at the October 11 announcement.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59de5a761400007a23494451.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Take heart, friends – all hope is not lost for our climate, and our clean air and water. Today I was honored to join an event in DC where the Sierra Club and Michael Bloomberg, United Nations Special Envoy for Cities and Climate Change and former Mayor of New York, announced we are doubling down once more to continue retiring America’s coal plants and transitioning the US economy to clean energy. On the heels of the Trump administration’s decision to repeal the Clean Power Plan, President Obama’s signature carbon pollution standards, our message is clear - together with dozens of partner organizations, we will continue to advance our nation’s overwhelming commitment to expand clean energy and fight climate disruption, even when the Trump administration chooses denial and inaction.As storms and wildfires worsened by climate change ravage our nation, and as Trump and his Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt again put polluters over public health, the grassroots power of the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal campaign and our allies won’t back down. Coal is not coming back, and the renewable energy revolution is here to stay.The pace of coal retirements and renewable energy growth haven’t slowed since the election, and this renewed support from Bloomberg Philanthropies will allow us to ensure that progress continues. Seventeen coal plants have announced their retirement since Election Day 2016 - one plant every 20 days - including some of the nation’s biggest and most polluting coal plants. That’s 9,822 megawatts of dirty power that pollutes our air and water, makes our families sick, and worsens climate change. Tens of thousands of parents, students, public health officials, business owners, Tribal leaders, clergy, community leaders and more have banded together nationwide to get those results by organizing, rallying, contacting their elected officials, and more - and those results are just from the past year.Since the Beyond Coal campaign started focusing on existing coal plants in 2010, our grassroots activists and partners have helped retire 119,417 megawatts of proposed dirty coal power, or 259 coal plants, which means that almost half the coal plants in the US are now slated for retirement. By continuing this progress, we’ll provide the primary engine for meeting the US Paris climate commitment, regardless of TrumpIn this next chapter of our work, we’re going to keep slashing carbon, build an ever stronger and more powerful movement to move the electric sector to clean energy, and help decarbonize the remaining sectors, giving us a fighting chance to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. It’s also essential that we diversify the economy in communities that have historically relied on coal, like my home state of West Virginia. Our nation must provide the financial resources, political leadership, and other needed support to ensure no one is left behind as we make this shift to clean energy.The Sierra Club’s Ready For 100 campaign will continue demonstrating the amazing support for expanding clean energy. More than 150 mayors and 33 cities have now committed to powering their communities with 100 percent clean energy, and we’ll keep adding to that list in the months ahead. Cities and towns are stepping up where the national leadership is lacking on clean energy and climate action.As I said in my column earlier this week, the fight against the dangerous Clean Power Plan repeal is only just beginning. We have every intention of mobilizing to make our voices are heard when the EPA conducts its legally required comment period and of fighting any new rule that does not comply with the Clean Air Act in court. That work extends to making sure the clean energy transition continues as well, by continuing to retire coal plants and replace them with renewable power, as solar and wind energy continue their exponential growth nationwide.The Sierra Club and our allies are committed to making sure the U.S. remains as a leader on climate action, despite Trump. In the leadership vacuum created by the Trump administration, the grassroots are rising. Join us. "

Her home was left in stable condition after the hurricane, but Marathon was hit hard. This motivated Langley to start the MM50 Relief Project, also known as Mile Marker 50 Relief Project, which is run by Marathon High School graduates.

Keeney told HuffPost that Langley saw the post and reached out to see if she could help.While planning for the festival, Keeney had the idea to ask for costume donations. She realized that in past years, most students wore their costumes to the festival, but this year would likely be different because of the devastation. Langley’s garage is now half full with new and gently used Halloween costumes.

Keeney said the response to the festival has been “overwhelming.”“I initially did it to see if I could get some candy and prizes from Target,” she told HuffPost. “Then when Krystal got involved, she reached far more people than I ever could.”Both women know the recovery is far from over, but are happy to help provide a break from the chaos. Langley filed for MM50 Relief Project to become a nonprofit and has plans for a site as well as events for the upcoming holidays in November and December. She told HuffPost that many larger agencies have already left the state, but she hopes her relief project will continue even after Florida has recovered from the damage brought by Irma.“This will go on much longer than the rebuilding after Irma,” she said. “If someone’s home burns down or they have some type of unforeseen circumstance, this relief project can reach out and help others and reach beyond the Keys once they’ve been rebuilt.” To learn how you can help, head to MM50 Relief Project’s Facebook and Instagram pages."

18,POLITICS,Mitch McConnell Is Keeping The Senate Rule That Lets Dems Block Trump's Judges,Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mitch-mcconnell-blue-slips-trump-judges_us_59de3683e4b0b26332e87e42,"The GOP leader may not personally be a fan of blue slips, but he's not getting rid of them, says his spokesman.",2017-10-11,"Mitch McConnell is feeling the heat from conservative groups to do more to confirm President Donald Trump's judicial nominees. He does not appear willing to axe the so-called blue-slip rule to appease them, however.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59de3ac3140000dd4a4943b7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) will continue to honor the blue slip rule ― an arcane but hugely consequential Senate tradition that lets lawmakers block a president’s judicial nominees from their home states ― even though a news article suggested he would get rid of it, his spokesman said.The Weekly Standard reported Wednesday that McConnell said in an interview that Democrats would no longer be allowed to use the rule to deny some of President Donald Trump’s judicial nominees a committee hearing or a vote.The Senate Judiciary Committee currently requires both home-state senators of a judicial nominee to turn in a blue slip ― literally, a blue piece of paper ― to signal support for moving forward with the nominee. Without blue slips from both senators, the nominee won’t get a hearing and the nomination is effectively dead. Blue slips amount to giving a single senator veto power over a president’s court pick.In his interview, McConnell said that, from now on, Republicans will treat a blue slip “as simply notification of how you’re going to vote, not as an opportunity to blackball.”The article’s author, Fred Barnes, wrote that that means the blue slip rule now “won’t be honored at all.”But McConnell spokesman Don Stewart said McConnell was talking about his own view on blue slips, and was not saying that Republicans won’t uphold the rule anymore.“No, he’s been talking about HIS position on the matter for some time now,” Stewart told HuffPost in an email. “If you mean he’s not announcing a committee position, then yes, he’s not announcing a committee position.”He mentioned a September article where McConnell said his personal view is that senators shouldn’t be able to use blue slips to block appeals court nominees, but should be able to for the lower district court nominees.Both parties have used blue slips to block a president’s court picks. Sens. Al Franken (D-Minn.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) have said they won’t turn in blue slips for some of Trump’s judicial nominees from their states. Republicans routinely used blue slips to block President Barack Obama’s judicial nominees, even when it meant blocking people they had originally recommended to Obama (looking at you, Marco Rubio of Florida and Richard Burr of North Carolina).It’s ultimately up to Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the Judiciary Committee’s chairman, to decide whether to honor blue slips as he schedules hearings for Trump’s court picks. So far, he has, and Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), the panel’s former chairman, told HuffPost in June that Grassley gave him his word he would keep the rule.“This should be, and has historically been, the decision of the chair, and Chuck Grassley has been trying to be as fair as possible,” said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond who specializes in judicial nominations.A Grassley spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment on whether the senator had any plans to nix the blue slip rule.McConnell is under tremendous pressure from conservative groups to do more to confirm Trump’s judges. The right-leaning Judicial Crisis Network was planning to launch a $250,000 ad buy in Washington this week calling on the GOP leader to either change the Senate rules to force through judges or keep the chamber in session to wear down Democrats into confirming a spate of them. McConnell’s aides contacted the group to defuse the situation, per Politico.Another group, the Conservative Action Project, released a memo this week signed by more than 100 conservative activists demanding that McConnell “IMMEDIATELY schedule committee and floor action every Thursday and Friday for the foreseeable future” to confirm judges and other presidential nominees.Trump has been nominating judges at lightning speed since taking office, outpacing both Obama and former President George W. Bush in the number of nominated by this point in their White House tenure. The White House has been working closely with the right-leaning Federalist Society to pick his appeals court nominees, many of whom have been young, conservative, and opposed to LGBTQ rights and abortion rights.The Senate hasn’t confirmed many of Trump’s picks, though ― a total of six district and appeals court judges so far ― hence the pressure on McConnell to do more. That’s due in part to the Senate’s packed legislative schedule, as well as general chaos emanating from the White House and Democrats delaying or blocking action on nominees they oppose.McConnell told The Weekly Standard that’s going to change.When nominees “come out of committee, I guarantee they will be dealt with,” he said. “Regardless of what tactics are used by Democrats, the judges are going to be confirmed.”It should be relatively easy for Republicans to confirm judges. It only takes 51 votes to confirm a district or appeals court judge, and there are 52 GOP senators. It also only takes 51 votes to clear a filibuster for those nominees. That used to require 60 votes, but when Democrats controlled the chamber in 2013, they lowered the threshold after Republicans routinely used the filibuster to block Obama’s nominees."

The facilities will provide affordable access to primary and preventive care ― including behavioral health, physical therapy, social work, oral health and family planning ― to those with little-to-no health care. “Through my years of working with Novant Health, I have been impressed with their approach and their commitment to the community,” Jordan, who was raised in Wilmington and attended UNC-Chapel Hill, said in a press release. “It is my hope that these clinics will help provide a brighter and healthier future for the children and families they serve.”Estee Portnoy, a spokeswoman for Jordan, told the Charlotte Observer that he was largely motivated to contribute after a 2014 study found that compared to other big cities in the country, Charlotte’s poor children have the worst chance of making it out of poverty. Over five years, the two clinics are projected to serve nearly 35,000 underserved children and adults, according to the press release. “This gift will transform the lives of thousands of families and children living in poverty-stricken communities,” Carl Armato, president and CEO of Novant Health, told the Associated Press. “We are thankful to Michael for his generosity. The gift will remove barriers to high-quality health care in some of the most vulnerable communities.”ESPN reports that this is the former NBA star’s largest philanthropic gift ever. In 2016, Jordan gave $5 million to the National Museum of African American History and Culture; he also pledged $1 million to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and the Institute for Community-Police Relations to help “build trust and respect between communities and law enforcement.”"

Justin credited Sophie for helping him realize that teaching their daughter, Ella-Grace, about the impact of her own voice was a fine start, but gender equality can only be achieved by teaching it to their sons, Xavier and Hadrien, as well.“I was talking about teaching Ella that she can be anything she wants to be,” Justin wrote. “Sophie said, ‘That’s great, but how are you raising your sons to be strong advocates for women and girls, too?’”Justin wrote that it’s “maddening” that his “brilliant, compassionate daughter” will face obstacles simply because she is a girl. He also noted that although society has come so far in gender equality, it still has a long way to go. “It’s 2017, yet in Canada and around the world, women and girls still face violence, discrimination, stereotypes that limit them and unequal opportunities that keep them from achieving their dreams,” he wrote. This motivates Justin and Sophie to teach Ella that she has a “strong voice” and “intrinsic worth,” while simultaneously teaching their sons to be allies and “walk through the world with openness, love, and a fierce attachment to justice.”Justin made it clear that a world where gender equality exists doesn’t only benefit women. In that world, while women fulfill their potential, men can be comfortable rejecting traditional norms of masculinity. “I want my sons to escape the pressure to be a particular kind of masculine that is so damaging to men and to the people around them,” he wrote. “I want them to be comfortable being themselves, and being feminists who stand up for what’s right, and who can look themselves in the eye with pride.”As Justin put it, “Feminism is not just the belief that men and women are equal. It’s the knowledge that when we are all equal, all of us are more free.”"
21,WOMEN,Sexual Assault Survivors Aren’t Just Daughters. They’re Actually Humans.,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sexual-assault-daughters-hollywood_us_59de298fe4b0b26332e86301,Matt Damon and others dehumanize women when they invoke daughters and sisters in public statements condemning Harvey Weinstein.,2017-10-11,"""As the father of four daughters, this is the kind of sexual predation that keeps me up at night,"" actor Matt Damon said of the allegations against producer Harvey Weinstein.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59de2c7b2d00009717309bee.jpeg?cache=dmwyW2BR6k&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"“As someone who knows fans of country music, I was horrified by the mass shooting at a concert in Las Vegas” ― said no one ever. That’s because you only need to be human to understand that fatally gunning down 58 people and wounding hundreds of others is a heinous, immoral act.In the same vein, you should only need to be human to understand that it’s wrong when a man sexually harasses and assaults a woman, grabbing her body without her permission, demanding she put her hands on his naked flesh, blocking her from leaving a room, or pushing her head down to his crotch. These are all things that Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein did to young women who were looking to him as a potential mentor and boss, according to accounts in The New York Times and The New Yorker. If they didn’t comply, Weinstein reportedly threatened that he’d end their careers.Clearly bad stuff.Yet at least a couple of celebrity men put out statements or gave interviews about these revelations with a qualifier ― emphasizing that as fathers of daughters, they found this behavior abhorrent.“Look, even before I was famous, I didn’t abide this kind of behavior,” mega-star Matt Damon said in an interview with Deadline Hollywood in which he condemned Weinstein’s behavior and denied reports that he had helped cover it up. “But now, as the father of four daughters, this is the kind of sexual predation that keeps me up at night. This is the great fear for all of us.”Later in the interview, Damon says, “We have to be vigilant and we have to help protect and call this stuff out, because we have our sisters and our daughters and our mothers.”Ben Affleck also took care to mention that we need to do better in “protecting our sisters, friends, coworkers and daughters.” (Weinstein has several daughters, and that doesn’t seem to have checked his behavior in any way.)Singer Vanessa Carlton urged actress Gwyneth Paltrow to speak out because she has a daughter ― as if the pain of Weinstein’s other victims and possible future victims wasn’t enough. Daughter qualifiers played an even bigger role in Pussygate one year ago, when Republicans rushed to condemn Donald Trump’s statements on the now-infamous “Access Hollywood” tape. “Such vile degradations demean our wives and daughters,” tweeted former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney at the time.“As the grandfather of two precious girls,” Jeb Bush said, “I find that no apology can excuse away Donald Trump’s reprehensible comments degrading women.”As I wrote back then, the implication behind these kinds of statements is that women are only worthy of basic respect in relation to men. If a man is killed or murdered, it’s much harder to find similar quotes from politicians talking about their sons and fathers and grandsons. That’s because men see each other as humans. And a lot of men still don’t view girls or women that way. Indeed, almost from birth, boys and girls are taught that they’re very different from each other. And stereotypes about how girls are weak and boys are strong are drilled into kids. It’s no wonder that some boys grow up to sexually assault women and others grow up wanting to protect them.In a sense, sexual assault is the flip side of the “daughter statement.” In both situations, a woman is an object ― to grope or to protect from groping. She’s not a person, but a thing that men have power over.Of course, having children is extremely meaningful. And, yes, some parents feel a heightened urge to guard their offspring that also leads them to feel heightened empathy for other kids. At least, that’s been the case for me personally. And the truth is, for men, having a daughter can be somewhat transformative.But that’s simply not a prerequisite for feeling empathy for victims of sexual assault.Not everyone felt compelled to mention their offspring in their recent statements about Weinstein. Former President Barack Obama, whose own daughter interned for the producer, made no mention of the fact that he is the father of girls in his statement on Tuesday.“Michelle and I have been disgusted by the recent reports of Harvey Weinstein. Any man who demeans and degrades women in such fashion needs to be condemned and held accountable, regardless of wealth or status,” Obama wrote. “We should celebrate the courage of women who have come forward to tell these painful stories,” he added. “And we all need to build a culture, including by empowering our girls and teaching our boys decency and respect, so we can make such behavior less prevalent in the future.”Decency and respect. You don’t need a daughter to understand that."

Trump claimed that the U.S. has the highest level of corporate taxation in the world ― a statement that is misleading.“When it comes to the business tax, we are now dead last among developed nations,” Trump said. “Our rate is the least competitive rate. We have the highest tax rate anywhere in the world. How foolish is this? Our business tax rate is 60 percent higher than our average economic competitor.”While the U.S. does have the highest nominal corporate rate, of about 39 percent, that’s not what most corporations actually pay. The Congressional Research Service has said the effective corporate rate is closer to 27 percent, roughly in line with the rate of other advanced countries. As for the general level of taxation for both business and individuals relative to the size of the economy, data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development put the U.S. in the middle of the pack at about 25 percent, well below the average of 34 percent for developed countries.The Republican tax framework would lower the corporate rate to 20 percent while reducing the number of individual income tax brackets and lowering the top rate to 35 percent. The plan would also simplify the tax code by eliminating most deductions. Trump insisted Wednesday that the middle class would get a tax cut under the Republican outline. “You’re going to have so much money to spend in this wonderful country,” Trump promised. “We will cut taxes for everyday, hardworking Americans.”Though the details are sketchy, other Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Trump’s own chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, have said that not every middle-class household would necessarily benefit from the plan. An analysis by the Tax Policy Center found that nearly a third of households with annual incomes between $50,000 and $150,000 would face higher taxes under the plan, which would disproportionately benefit the wealthiest Americans. Trump and other Republican leaders have touted an increased “standard deduction” in their framework for reform. The standard deduction currently allows a family to reduce the amount of their income subject to taxes by $12,700. The Republican plan would bump the deduction to $24,000 while eliminating most itemized deductions, including the “personal exemption” of $4,050 per person.Some families would lose out with the bigger standard deduction because they benefit more from the current deduction plus personal exemptions for family members that would be eliminated. Republicans have suggested a larger child tax credit to make up the difference, though they haven’t specified an amount. Another key component of the GOP plan would eliminate a tax on inheritances ― a provision that would benefit only a small number of extremely wealthy families each year but which Republicans have tried to sell as a small-business benefit. Wednesday night, Trump called it the “crushing, unfair and horrible estate tax, sometimes known as the death tax.”He added that eliminating the inheritance tax would specifically benefit the Ewells, a Pennsylvania family that’s been in the trucking business since 1946 and owns H.R. Ewell Inc.Trump said that eliminating the estate tax would allow Calvin Ewell to pass the business to his son the way it had been passed down to him.However, estates worth less than $5.4 million are exempt from the tax ― a threshold considerably higher than the $675,000 that was in place before the George W. Bush tax cuts of the early 2000s.Arthur Delaney and S.V. Date debated the likelihood that Congress will actually pass tax reform on the HuffPost Politics podcast. The conversation starts at 28:50. "

24,CRIME,MGM 'Confident' That Police Are Wrong About Las Vegas Shooting Timeline,Carla Herreria,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mgm-resorts-dispute-las-vegas-shooting-timeline_us_59dd822be4b0b26332e7c94f,"Mandalay Bay's parent company offered its own timeline of events, which differs from the one released by police.",2017-10-11,Stephen Paddock shot at a Las Vegas country music festival from a shattered window in his 32nd-floor suite at the MGM-owned Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59dd9b82140000a6234942b8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"MGM Resorts International, the company that owns the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, is disputing police officials’ timeline of events leading up to and during the mass shooting in Las Vegas last week.During a Monday news conference, Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said gunman Stephen Paddock first shot at a hotel security guard six minutes before opening fire from his 32nd-floor room at the Mandalay Bay onto an outdoor country music festival below, killing at least 58 people and injuring hundreds of others. Lombardo also said Paddock had checked into the Mandalay Bay on Sept. 25, three days earlier than police first reported.This timeline replaced officials’ previous belief that the shooting was already underway when security guard Jesus Campos approached Paddock’s door to his corner suite, spurring Paddock to cease firing on the festival and shoot at Campos before turning the gun on himself.But MGM offered its own version of the events Thursday.“We know that shots were being fired at the festival lot at the same time as, or within 40 seconds after, the time Jesus Campos first reported that shots were fired over the radio,” MGM said in a statement to the Washington Post. “Metro officers were together with armed Mandalay Bay security officers in the building when Campos first reported that shots were fired over the radio.”MGM had expressed doubt in Las Vegas police earlier this week after officials announced they were changing their timeline of the events that played out in Paddock’s room on Oct. 1.“This remains an ongoing investigation with a lot of moving parts,” MGM spokeswoman Debra DeShong said in a statement sent to HuffPost on Tuesday.“As evidenced by law enforcement briefings over the past week, many facts are still unverified and continue to change as events are under review. We cannot be certain about the most recent timeline that has been communicated [publicly], and we believe what is currently being expressed may not be accurate.”An investigator told the Los Angeles Times last week that police now believe Campos, who was wounded by Paddock, first alerted hotel security officials of a gunman on the 32nd floor before the massacre began. Clark County Assistant Sheriff Tom Roberts told the Times that Campos, who possibly used a hallway phone, “called it in before” Paddock turned his guns onto the music festival.“He manually called down and he used his radio to call,” Roberts told the newspaper, later adding, “We just don’t know how long it took him to call. He’s getting shot at, he’s running, he’s getting shot, he finds some cover, that’s when he starts calling in.”MGM argued that police officials’ timeline was “derived from” a report manually created by Mandalay Bay “after the fact without the benefit of information we now have.”“We are now confident that the time stated in this report is not accurate,” MGM said in its Thursday statement.As the Post pointed out, MGM’s statement claims police and security officers “immediately responded to the 32nd floor,” where the shooting was carried out, but Lombardo has said police didn’t get to Paddock until 12 minutes after the shooting began.Paddock, 64, a reportedly wealthy high-stakes gambler, is responsible for one of the deadliest mass shootings in modern U.S. history. While firing at Campos, Paddock shot more than 200 rounds down the hotel’s hallway, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Campos was shot in the thigh.Lombardo told the Las Vegas Review-Journal on Tuesday that investigators have been in contact with Paddock’s entire “family tree,” including his two ex-wives, combed through Paddock’s suite and reviewed security footage, but have found no information on why Paddock carried out the attack.Police believe Paddock was the only shooter involved. Lombardo told the Review-Journal on Tuesday that the timeline “could change even more.”In the statement to HuffPost, MGM’s DeShong said, “We understand the public’s desire for information and the importance of getting our community and the public at large the information they deserve, and we are doing everything we can to support law enforcement’s efforts to do so. Therefore, it is not appropriate for us to comment further at this time on what remains an open matter for law enforcement.” This story has been updated throughout with information from MGM's Thursday statements."
25,POLITICS,France’s Biggest Bank Becomes The First To Cut Off Funding For Natural Gas Fracking,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bnp-paribas-fracking_us_59de7f41e4b00abf3646192f,But BNP Paribas is leaving loopholes open.,2017-10-11,People pass a BNP Paribas bank logo in Singapore's central business district in a photo shot in January 2016.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59de8faa2d0000265e309dc6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BNP Paribas on Wednesday became the first big bank to pledge to stop financing natural gas fracking projects as part of a new policy cheered by environmentalists as having the greatest impact of any financial giant yet. Under the new policy, France’s largest bank will refuse to lend to companies who generate more than half their revenue from fracked oil, gas or liquefied natural gas export terminals. The rules also apply to tar sands, considered one of the dirtiest sources of oil. Multinational banks, including BNP Paribas, began putting strict limits on funding for coal projects in 2015. At that point, coal was becoming an unprofitable investment, and banks faced mounting pressure from environmentalists to stop supporting the dirtiest fuels in the lead up the Paris climate agreement. Last month, JPMorgan Chase became the target of a new campaign urging it to end financing for companies that drill tar sands, a particularly dirty source of oil that forms the backbone of Canada’s industry. Until now, no financial giant has clamped down on natural gas, which produces far less carbon dioxide than oil or coal. The fuel now provides most of the United States’ electricity and is credited with reducing emissions by weaning the country off coal. That has allowed advocates to tout the gas as a critical tool in the transition from heavily-polluting fuels to renewable energy. Natural gas also has critical geopolitical significance, as President Donald Trump moves to increase pipelines and build up export infrastructure to start selling the fuel to overseas buyers, including energy-hungry China.But fracking ― an extraction technique that involves shooting a highly-pressurized chemical and sand-laced water into shale rock to extract oil and gas ― has become a lightning rod for environmentalists. It produces toxic wastewater and leaks emissions of methane, a far more most potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. And the process of liquefying natural gas from vapor requires so much energy it ends up being as dirty as coal.“The scientific literature on the climate impact of gas, especially fracked gas, is emerging,” Jason Disterhoft, a senior campaigner at Rainforest Action Network, told HuffPost by phone. Now that the prices of solar and wind energy were plummeting, there’s less need to use natural gas as a stepping stone between dirtier fossil fuels and renewables, he added.“The bridge-fuel argument has a lot of holes in it, and at this point, it’s a false choice, especially with the rapidly declining cost of renewables.”BNP Paribas offered few details on its new policy, including when it would go into effect, though it said it should have an update by the end of the year. Europe’s second largest bank also said that companies could continue to receive backing if they lower the amount of revenue earned from fracking or tar sands to less than half their business. The exact ratio has not yet been decided, a spokeswoman said.“Even though we’re going to have this policy in place doesn’t mean at the same time we’ll right away cut all the clients that don’t fall under it,” Mylene Benmoussa, a BNP Paribas spokeswoman, told HuffPost by phone on Wednesday. “It’s going to be a gradual and shared transition.”The bank had not not yet calculated how many clients would be affected by the new policy, and could not immediately respond to questions about how much money is invested in the targeted sectors.France banned fracking in 2011. The country generates 11 percent of its electricity from gas, according to data from RTE, the French transmission operator. And the government in Paris announced plans last month to prohibit oil and gas production by 2040. For a bank in the regulatory environment BNP Paribas is facing, an aggressive climate policy makes business sense.Yet the announcement garnered praise from four environmental groups that teamed up to pressure BNP Paribas to curtail support for fossil fuels that pose a particular threat of exacerbating climate change. The foursome includes the San Francisco-based Rainforest Action Network, the French chapter of Friends of Earth, and Save the Rio Grande Valley from Liquefied Natural Gas, a local Texas group protesting the construction of a liquefied natural gas terminal in the state’s southern region. As part of the new policy, BNP Paribas will continue to serve as a financial adviser to the Texas project, but will not provide funding. Still, the move represents a public relations victory for a bank plagued by scandals in recent years. In 2015, the company was ordered to pay $8.9 billion to the U.S. for violating sanctions against Sudan, Cuba and Iran. In June, three human rights groups accused BNP Paribas of complicity in the 1994 Rwandan genocide that killed more than 800,000 people. In July, the Federal Reserve fined the firm $246 million for its “unsafe and unsound practices” in foreign currency trading division, failing to crack down on employees who violated rules on sharing information with competitors.“We’re a long-standing partner to the energy sector and we’re determined to support the transition to a more sustainable world,” BNP Paribas CEO Jean-Laurent Bonnafé said in a statement. “As an international bank, our role is to help drive the energy transition and contribute to the decarbonization of the economy.”"

Starting late Sunday, at least 22 wildfires swept through several counties, including Napa and Sonoma, killing at least 23 people and injuring more than 100. As of late Wednesday, the Sonoma Sheriff’s Office told HuffPost that hundreds of people are still unaccounted for. They said that power outages and intermittent cell phone service may be preventing people from contacting friends and relatives.California Gov. Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency Monday, and thousands of people have since been forced to flee their homes in mandatory evacuations. By Wednesday morning, at least 3,500 homes and businesses had been destroyed and nearly 170,000 acres burned, according to Daniel Berlant of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.For those who are evacuating, some will have friends or family to stay with, others can afford a hotel for a few nights ― but for the most vulnerable groups, such as the elderly and the poor, many are staying in one of the dozens of Red Cross shelters that have been set up in the region.At one such shelter at the Sonoma County Fairgrounds in Santa Rosa ― one of the hardest-hit cities, where smoke still hung thick in the air Tuesday afternoon ― about 300 people had spent the night, according to Jim Bray, Red Cross volunteer and assistant manager at the shelter. Many of those staying at the fairgrounds were older residents from retirement communities.“We haven’t heard anything ― we think that’s a good sign,” said Candace Hayes, who evacuated from Vigil Light, an affordable housing community for the elderly and disabled, on Monday. Hayes, who is blind, said her biggest concern was “going home. I’d like to go home.”“That’s the one thing I don’t like: We don’t know what’s going on or what’s going to happen,” she added, as she petted her service dog on the head. “It’s all kind of up in the air.”HuffPost spoke to several evacuees at the shelter, and a common concern was simply that people wanted to see their homes again, to make sure they were still standing.“There’s a large evacuation area in Santa Rosa, and even if your house isn’t destroyed, the police are not letting people back in there. That causes a lot of consternation for people, because they don’t know,” Bray told HuffPost, noting that over 500 homes have been lost in the city, about 50 miles north of San Francisco. “Other people know their houses have been burned, but they’re still being kept out.”One couple, Marion and Lloid Heim, who had evacuated from Santa Rosa on Monday and stayed overnight at a hotel, managed to get back to their house Tuesday only to find it burned to the ground. It was one of many houses on several blocks near Coffey Lane and San Miguel Road that had been leveled by the flames. In some cases, single chimneys or car skeletons were the only recognizable structures left. “Everything that we have is charcoal,” said Marion Heim, 67, as she stood on the pile of ashes and rubble where her house used to stand. “How fast your life can just… go away.”Marion and her husband, Lloid, had moved into the house just a year ago, after living for close to four decades in San Rafael, in Marin County. She was confident the insurance would reimburse them for the house, but her biggest concern was whether to rebuild in the same spot. “I loved this house when we first came here, because it was like Little House on the Prairie,” said Marion, a retired nurse. “When I first walked in, I just knew, it just felt like home.”“When you see it on TV, you don’t realize until it happens to you: It’s like a death, it’s just so... unreal,” she added. “But this too shall pass.

29,IMPACT,How This Native Educator Is Keeping A Tribal Language Alive,Sarah Ruiz-Grossman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/native-educator-teaching-omaha-umonhon-language_us_59af2a3de4b0354e440d7f01,Only a handful of elders on the reservation speak it fluently today.,2017-10-11,"Vida Woodhull-Stabler (right), Mark WhiteEyes (center) and Liz WhiteEyes (left) with students in 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59af2c4e1b000039005b4b1f.jpeg?cache=WX8wMKhSi7&ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"On the Omaha Native American reservation in northeastern Nebraska, one educator is working hard to keep the tribal language alive by helping kids to learn it in school.Vida Woodhull Stabler is the director of the Omaha (or “Umonhon” in the tribe’s language) culture center at Umonhon Nation Public Schools in Macy, Nebraska. She has been working for the past 18 years to painstakingly gather, record and pass on the cultural knowledge of tribal elders for future generations. Alongside other elders in the community, she has helped to developed a curriculum and lesson plans for Umonhon language classes, as well as other ways to infuse students’ day-to-day school experience with culturally relevant learnings, such as tribal songs and dance.But she and her colleagues face an uphill battle: Only about a dozen Umonhon tribe members are believed to speak the language fluently today, Stabler told HuffPost.“It is important for children” to learn the Umonhon language, Stabler told HuffPost. “I truly believe this: There is an innate need, want and love of our culture inside of them. They will become stronger as human beings when they know who they are, and can stand firm and strong against all the challenges that life will throw at them.”Kyleigh Merrick, 15, who has attended Umonhon Nation schools since kindergarten, has chosen Umonhon language as an elective class.“I hope to become one of the fluent speakers,” Merrick told HuffPost. “To me it is really important for everyone to learn the language and to teach our kids, because there aren’t that many fluent speakers. If I can become a fluent speaker, I can teach everyone else and help the language not die.”In many Native communities across the U.S., tribal languages are endangered and are at risk of declining and even going extinct, as elder tribe members, who often are the ones who speak Native languages most fluently, die. For Merrick, learning the Umonhon language as a teen today is important but also a challenge. She goes to language class every day, where she learns everything from verbs to animals to numbers ― but outside of class, opportunities to speak it are scarce. Her great-grandmother uses it at home, but among her peers, only a handful will sometimes greet each other in Umonhon, and that’s “just to joke around.” At school, she says only “a few” students are taking Umonhon language class and seem deeply interested in tribal language and culture. “It’s just a few kids, not that many ― I think it all starts at home,” Merrick said. “The kids who choose movies over a ceremony or dance, it has to do with their parents and what they teach their kids ― if they pushed them to go to a ceremony or dances or social gatherings.”In Stabler’s experience, parents and the larger Umonhon tribal community are invested in passing on cultural knowledge, and do so in myriad ways to their kids ― but not always through language instruction. In her view, the biggest barrier is simply kids’ assimilation into mainstream culture.“There’s no doubt that our tribe, as well as many, are in a state of urgency. In our era, many of our remote places can have access to modern lure that take away our kids from cultural activity,” Stabler told HuffPost. “Instead of sitting and participating in a dance, they’d rather go to a movie. That’s youth, and that’s how assimilation happens.”Another significant force that has worked against the passing of Native tribal languages over generations is the history of American Indian boarding schools ― which have left a painful legacy in Native communities. The federal government began sending Native students to boarding schools in the mid-1800s, and up through the 1960s students there were not allowed to express tribal cultures and were taught only English, in an effort to forcefully assimilate them.“The boarding school experience beat the language out of them,” Mark Awakuni-Swetland, a former associate professor of anthropology at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln told the Omaha World-Herald in 2015, before his death. Awakuni-Swetland, who co-authored an Umonhon language dictionary, told the outlet that most boarding schools forced Native students to speak English, and the kids would be punished if they didn’t ― even beaten.On the Umonhon reservation in Nebraska, the harmful legacy of boarding schools is still felt today.“We’ve had to overcome a negative history with boarding schools to become more purposeful in teaching cultural values and norms of our community,” Stabler, who attended boarding school, told HuffPost. “Our community values our culture ― it was devalued in boarding school, but our community values it.”In Native communities nationwide, language revitalization efforts vary: In upstate New York, for instance, the Mohawk tribe offers its members deep language immersion programs, and in California, Native American Head Start preschools are teaching the youngest community members tribal languages from day one.For Stabler in Nebraska, given the Umonhon tribe and school’s limited funding, passing on the language is a daily effort of making the most of the little she has. “Our language does not have access to the same types of materials that Spanish or German do ― you can walk into any library and bookstore and find oodles of Spanish books to buy,” Stabler said. “Our community has had to develop materials, tangible stuff ― on our own. The first challenge is ensuring people want to learn and teach ― the second is making sure they have materials to learn from.”Stabler provides the language and culture materials she and others have developed over the years to the larger Umonhon tribal community, including Native community members in Lincoln and Omaha, as well as Nebraska Indian Community College, which also teaches Umonhon language and tribal history.At Umonhon Nation public schools, Stabler makes a point of incorporating tribal culture into students’ everyday school experience, which can mean something like hanging up a calendar with months in English and Umonhon, or working with the administration to infuse Umonhon culture into other classes. In biology class, for instance, kids might harvest corn to make traditional tribal foods, or in “family sciences” class, they might learn to do ribbon work or make moccasins.

She has been working for the past 18 years to painstakingly gather, record and pass on the cultural knowledge of tribal elders for future generations. Alongside other elders in the community, she has helped to developed a curriculum and lesson plans for Umonhon language classes, as well as other ways to infuse students’ day-to-day school experience with culturally relevant learnings, such as tribal songs and dance.But she and her colleagues face an uphill battle: Only about a dozen Umonhon tribe members are believed to speak the language fluently today, Stabler told HuffPost.“It is important for children” to learn the Umonhon language, Stabler told HuffPost. “I truly believe this: There is an innate need, want and love of our culture inside of them. They will become stronger as human beings when they know who they are, and can stand firm and strong against all the challenges that life will throw at them.”Kyleigh Merrick, 15, who has attended Umonhon Nation schools since kindergarten, has chosen Umonhon language as an elective class.“I hope to become one of the fluent speakers,” Merrick told HuffPost. “To me it is really important for everyone to learn the language and to teach our kids, because there aren’t that many fluent speakers. If I can become a fluent speaker, I can teach everyone else and help the language not die.”In many Native communities across the U.S., tribal languages are endangered and are at risk of declining and even going extinct, as elder tribe members, who often are the ones who speak Native languages most fluently, die. For Merrick, learning the Umonhon language as a teen today is important but also a challenge. She goes to language class every day, where she learns everything from verbs to animals to numbers ― but outside of class, opportunities to speak it are scarce. Her great-grandmother uses it at home, but among her peers, only a handful will sometimes greet each other in Umonhon, and that’s “just to joke around.” At school, she says only “a few” students are taking Umonhon language class and seem deeply interested in tribal language and culture. “It’s just a few kids, not that many ― I think it all starts at home,” Merrick said. “The kids who choose movies over a ceremony or dance, it has to do with their parents and what they teach their kids ― if they pushed them to go to a ceremony or dances or social gatherings.”In Stabler’s experience, parents and the larger Umonhon tribal community are invested in passing on cultural knowledge, and do so in myriad ways to their kids ― but not always through language instruction. In her view, the biggest barrier is simply kids’ assimilation into mainstream culture.“There’s no doubt that our tribe, as well as many, are in a state of urgency. In our era, many of our remote places can have access to modern lure that take away our kids from cultural activity,” Stabler told HuffPost. “Instead of sitting and participating in a dance, they’d rather go to a movie. That’s youth, and that’s how assimilation happens.”Another significant force that has worked against the passing of Native tribal languages over generations is the history of American Indian boarding schools ― which have left a painful legacy in Native communities. The federal government began sending Native students to boarding schools in the mid-1800s, and up through the 1960s students there were not allowed to express tribal cultures and were taught only English, in an effort to forcefully assimilate them.“The boarding school experience beat the language out of them,” Mark Awakuni-Swetland, a former associate professor of anthropology at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln told the Omaha World-Herald in 2015, before his death. Awakuni-Swetland, who co-authored an Umonhon language dictionary, told the outlet that most boarding schools forced Native students to speak English, and the kids would be punished if they didn’t ― even beaten.On the Umonhon reservation in Nebraska, the harmful legacy of boarding schools is still felt today.“We’ve had to overcome a negative history with boarding schools to become more purposeful in teaching cultural values and norms of our community,” Stabler, who attended boarding school, told HuffPost. “Our community values our culture ― it was devalued in boarding school, but our community values it.”In Native communities nationwide, language revitalization efforts vary: In upstate New York, for instance, the Mohawk tribe offers its members deep language immersion programs, and in California, Native American Head Start preschools are teaching the youngest community members tribal languages from day one.For Stabler in Nebraska, given the Umonhon tribe and school’s limited funding, passing on the language is a daily effort of making the most of the little she has. “Our language does not have access to the same types of materials that Spanish or German do ― you can walk into any library and bookstore and find oodles of Spanish books to buy,” Stabler said. “Our community has had to develop materials, tangible stuff ― on our own. The first challenge is ensuring people want to learn and teach ― the second is making sure they have materials to learn from.”Stabler provides the language and culture materials she and others have developed over the years to the larger Umonhon tribal community, including Native community members in Lincoln and Omaha, as well as Nebraska Indian Community College, which also teaches Umonhon language and tribal history.At Umonhon Nation public schools, Stabler makes a point of incorporating tribal culture into students’ everyday school experience, which can mean something like hanging up a calendar with months in English and Umonhon, or working with the administration to infuse Umonhon culture into other classes. In biology class, for instance, kids might harvest corn to make traditional tribal foods, or in “family sciences” class, they might learn to do ribbon work or make moccasins.

It’s about social justice.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59dd649a140000492349424d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Recovery pride and recovery advocacy are powerful social change movements. I should know, because take part in them. My activism is an important part of my recovery. I get to work with groups like Facing Addiction and the Alano Club to make sure that people like me are visible, heard, and validated. I’ve shared my story many times in order to help break the stigma that surrounds addiction. I also lead writing workshops for people in recovery and teach others how to reclaim their power through their personal stories. I’m in the middle, as much as I can be. I’m doing my part. I know that what I contribute is helping to effect change, even in small ways. Every time I open my mouth, I’m validated. When I share my story, I get a lot of support and encouragement. Someone always reminds me that my honesty is helping someone else. Keep it up. People say that they relate.I hope that’s true. After all, silence is what kills us. Less than 10% of people with substance use problems will seek any kind of medical attention, treatment, or therapy. We are literally dying because we’re afraid to speak up. We’re taught that addiction is a dirty illness: advocating for ourselves puts us at risk. We could lose our homes, families, insurance coverage, jobs, and more if we speak up.Yet, some of us are.We are the lucky ones.Those of us who have stepped forward to publicly self-identify as addicts---or people in recovery, or whatever you want to call yourself---tend to have a few things in common. We are usually white. We’re middle class. Educated. Overwhelmingly, we’re heterosexual. Although there’s a 50/50 split between the sexes, women tend to be more vocal and more likely to interact with recovery-related content online. So, the odds are good that, if you’re reading this, you’re a smart, sober, white, cis woman. (Hi!)People like me have the privilege of being visible.Honestly, addiction is not a new phenomenon. Our attention is on it now, sure, but this is a recent development. We have a highly visible physical wellness culture: now, recovery is the hip new thing. As long as recovery is tied into health or spirituality, not a specific identity or political agenda, it gets plenty of media attention. Glennon Doyle Melton holding hands with Oprah? Fine. Recovery-positive rallies and 5K races? Fine. But raising up recovery that doesn’t belong to white, yoga-loving, coffee-sipping women is a little dicey. As long as recovery paints a pretty, inclusive picture, we’re good with it. Show the ugly side, or the non-conforming side, and all of a sudden, nobody wants to participate.Recovery is becoming a lifestyle brand, and its neatly packaged idea of what sobriety ‘should’ look like hurts people who don’t have access to it. The American drug epidemic has been happening for decades. We’ve suddenly started paying attention because, all of a sudden, opioid related deaths started affecting white, middle class people. People who look like me: young, white, suburban, feminine. People who are relatable. Yet, the death tolls and related crime rates aren’t that different than the crack epidemic that destroyed black communities in the 80s and 90s. Because addiction, blackness, and poverty are criminalized in our culture, the black leaders who advocated for stricter drug laws were run down by the punitive War on Drugs. Those “strict on crime” laws were used by white politicians to disproportionately arrest black men and keep them imprisoned for minor drug-related crimes. In 1989, nearly a million people were arrested on drug charges: more than twice the number just 7 years earlier. The people who were brave enough to raise their voices were shouted down as “radicals.” And today, white advocates like me can share our stories publicly, with little risk. Our privilege protects us from the factors that keep so many people in active addiction. People like me are commended for our bravery when we “come out” about our drug use. Yet, how are we brave? Comparatively, we have little to lose.Recovery has hit the mainstream. The policy changes and political involvement at the grassroots level is notable: hundreds of thousands of parents, friends, and people in recovery are speaking up and demanding federal involvement in the drug crisis. Those voices are loud, and they are effective. The White House has said that it may declare a state of emergency around the epidemic, which would unlock millions of federal dollars for groups, clinics, and nonprofits who are working to help people get into recovery. Every knows someone who’s experienced addiction. It’s an issue talked about everywhere, from living rooms to board rooms.Recovery is trickling down. I wonder if it will reach everyone who needs help, or pool around a few media-friendly faces. Why does someone like me get to do that, and not a poor, crack-addicted person of color, who lives in a rural area? Why is my story held up, and not hers? Simply, because addiction doesn’t discriminate, but recovery does. I suggest that, unless the recovery movement becomes truly inclusive, it will only repeat the oppressive patterns that have dogged all social justice movements. Until it is equally safe for a working class, queer, black, trans man to say “I am addicted” and have pride in himself as a person in recovery, as it is for a wealthy, straight, white woman who does the same thing, our movement cannot call itself a success. Until we pass laws that protect all people with substance use disorder from police violence, workplace discrimination, and exclusion from social services, we cannot say our movement is about justice. Until we all have the ability to celebrate our recovery openly, without fear of recrimination, our movement will not be complete.Recovery for some is not recovery for all. According to the National Association of Drug Court Professionals, 80% of inmates have substance use problems, and over half of the population is clinically addicted. “Incarceration rates in the U.S. are nine times greater for young African-American men between the ages of 20 and 34 years.” What are we—the vocal, predominantly white recovery mainstream—doing to help those young black men? Posting inspirational memes? Attending pink-washed consciousness-raising workshops? Those things are not bad, but they barely scratch the surface of what needs to be done. It’s easy to cop out, and say, “I need to take care of myself.” Sure. But where does self-care end, and community care begin? Those of us who are lucky enough to shed the stigma of addiction easily, with minimal consequences, must do more for the people who struggle with the same illness.I’ve been in recovery for more than a decade, and I’m grateful for what I have. I also know in my heart that my happiness and security is not enough. Me, feeling good, is not enough. The minute I got sober, and decided to stay that way, I became part of the recovery movement. I may not have known it at the time, but my involvement in this movement is the thing that enables me to stay sober. “Service work,” as it’s known in the 12 Step programs, helped me grow in my recovery. It turns out that, if I want to stay sober, I must help build a world that makes it possible for other people to have what I’ve attained as well. Now, I call my elected representatives regularly to make sure that addiction is a top issue for them. I have worked recovery hotlines, spoken to recovery groups, and helped connect others with the resources they need to stay sober. I march in rallies against oppression. I donate to groups that support recovery for diverse communities. I’m learning how to talk to outsiders about recovery, and help break the stigma of our illness. I have a strong recovery community, but I recognize that it’s more important to talk to people I don’t know—people who haven’t heard the message yet. This keeps me on the front lines of the recovery movement and helps make sure I don’t backslide into addiction.Trying to make recovery seem attractive isn’t sufficient, for me. I am definitely not a Recovery Barbie. I need actual, real-life, hands-on experience. No hashtags. A selfie is not service, for me. What I do isn’t difficult, but it asks me to look outside my comfortable bubble and do something for someone whose life is very different from mine. Even someone like me—who is not exactly a shining beacon of spiritual purity—has opportunities to help, in large and small ways. My recovery depends on helping another person, not just helping myself.What if we changed the conversation from self-care to someone-else care? Radical self-acceptance is great, but it’s just the first step. Even one person can have a huge impact in their neighborhood, community, town, and state. All you have to do is look beyond your own yoga mat. Ask yourself, what do I have that other people do not? For example, what if we created recovery-positive, inclusive spaces for people of color, members of the LGBTQ community, HIV-positive people, young people, and other marginalized groups? What if we actively reached out to people whose experiences of addiction were totally different from our own, and listened to their needs and concerns? What if we thought, how can I help instead of what do I need? If recovery is not “intersectional,” is in incomplete. I’m doing my part to see past my own horizons. I believe that the future of our movement---that’s my future, and yours too---depends on it.This article was also published at Transformation Is Real."
34,POLITICS,Celebrities And Experts Push Congress To End Trump's Support For Saudi Carnage In Yemen,Akbar Shahid Ahmed,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/yemen-war-saudi-coalition-us-support_us_59dbde4be4b0b34afa5b8c62,"With a House vote this week, a diverse group -- including Mark Ruffalo, Alice Walker, Laurence Tribe and FreedomWorks -- is getting involved.",2017-10-10,"Air strikes by the U.S.-backed coalition are responsible for more than 5,000 civilian casualties in Yemen, according to the United Nations.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59dbe0022d00009c173096a0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The lawmakers behind a major bipartisan effort to end U.S. assistance for a devastating Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen are getting help from big names in multiple arenas as they try to whip votes.Reps. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) and Walter Jones (R-N.C.) want an up-or-down House vote before the end of the week on a resolution to end American support for the Saudi-led coalition. A letter dated Oct. 9 and provided exclusively to HuffPost shows strong backing for their initiative from across the political spectrum and the national conversation: Foreign policy commentators like Noam Chomsky and Stephen Walt signed the letter, and so did actors Mark Ruffalo, Brie Larson and Martin Sheen, author Alice Walker, playwright Eve Ensler, prominent legal scholars like Harvard’s Laurence Tribe and Yale’s Bruce Ackerman, the tea party-linked group FreedomWorks, former officials under Democratic and Republican presidents, and former members of Congress from both parties.“By invoking provisions of U.S. law allowing for the introduction of a privileged resolution to withdraw unauthorized U.S. forces from this conflict, you are reasserting the rightful role of Congress,” reads the letter, formally addressed to the four congressmen. “We, the undersigned, encourage all U.S. Representatives to vote yes to this resolution. This measure strengthens U.S. governance to comport better with the Constitution, assists in reducing a genuine threat to national security posed by the expansion of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, and promises to assist in ending the senseless suffering of millions of innocent people in Yemen.”The Saudi-led coalition began fighting Iran-aligned rebels in Yemen, the Middle East’s poorest country, on behalf of the Yemeni government in March 2015. It received U.S. help from the start. Currently, aerial refueling provided by American aircraft enables bombing runs by the planes of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), while the U.S. government provides the coalition with intelligence and fresh stocks of weapons.But Congress has never authorized this military adventure or identified the Iran-backed rebel militia, the Houthis, as a threat to the United States.President Barack Obama originally approved U.S. support for Saudi Arabia, the UAE and other U.S.-aligned governments in the coalition. Obama administration officials have since explained he did it to reassure those countries that Washington’s support for them remained steadfast even after the U.S. reached a nuclear deal with Iran.That logic, however, never satisfied constitutionalists and anti-war activists who saw the U.S. support as militaristic executive overreach. It’s become less and less popular as the Saudi-led coalition has been accused of committing major war crimes in Yemen, which might implicate American officials, and of creating a humanitarian crisis with its naval blockade and bombing of key infrastructure in that country.The letter points to U.S. culpability in the suffering of Yemen’s people. It also highlights a major conundrum for U.S. foreign policy makers. While executive branch officials have justified many recent military interventions, including counterterror operations focused on Yemen, on the basis of a broad authorization for the use of military force against al Qaeda and its associates that Congress approved in 2001, support for the Saudi-led coalition is largely unrelated to the fight against al Qaeda, the Islamic State and other Islamic extremist groups. In fact, according to the U.S. State Department, the Yemen intervention has created a situation that’s benefiting the Yemeni branch of al Qaeda. The proposed House resolution would end U.S. support for the coalition’s operations against the Houthi rebels within 30 days. It’s written to appeal widely. It frames the question as one of American constitutional authority, avoiding messy debates about international laws of war and specifically preserving U.S. operations in Yemen that are narrowly focused on al Qaeda and similar threats.The resolution would be the most sweeping congressional action on the war yet. Previous efforts in both houses have targeted U.S. arms shipments to Saudi Arabia rather than the overall strategy of U.S. support for the campaign. Since 2015, lawmakers skeptical about the war have scheduled House and Senate votes aimed at those weapons sales. None of those measures passed, but they signaled how widely shared dislike of the war has become on Capitol Hill, with 204 House members supporting an effort to stop transfers of cluster munitions last year and 47 senators, including almost all Democrats, trying to block the sale of precision-guided bombs this summer.Fans of those measures often spoke of them as efforts to pressure Saudi Arabia and the UAE to be more careful in how they waged the war and to move more quickly to negotiate an end to it.In recent weeks, congressional staffers and human rights advocates have begun to focus more on American responsibility for Yemen’s pain and the possibility of ending U.S. support altogether.The logic behind the new House effort, backed by more than a dozen legal experts who signed the Oct. 9 letter, is that the War Powers Resolution of 1973 compels lawmakers to act because the ongoing American refueling and targeting assistance to the Saudi coalition constitute the introduction of unauthorized U.S. forces into hostilities ― and because there’s a clear threat the executive will approve such use of U.S. forces again.Congressional aides and activists trying to win support for the House resolution are concerned that GOP leadership may try to quash it. But the public approval of influential figures on the right and left, from former Rep.

But they can’t do it alone.""",2017-10-10,"WESTWOOD, CA - MAY 10: Paul Feig arrives at the premiere of 20th Century Fox's 'Snatched' at Regency Village Theatre on May 10, 2017 in Westwood, California. (Photo by Gregg DeGuire/WireImage)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59dcf37220000009340860ed.jpeg?cache=CVQrx6k6IX&ops=crop_71_100_4132_3457%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Director Paul Feig said his blood is “boiling” after hearing the allegations Harvey Weinstein sexually assaulted multiple women, and that those “enormously brave” women who have spoken out against Weinstein need the support of men in media now more than ever.Feig, the creator of the short-lived but much beloved show “Freaks and Geeks” and director of the movie “Bridesmaids,” told HuffPost in an exclusive interview that he feels “ashamed and frustrated” that he didn’t know about the allegations in the past, even as it was an open secret in many Hollywood circles.“I had never heard of the sexual assault charges, which I feel weird about because they were apparently so out there,” Feig said. “That’s what I’m finding out now. It had never trickled down to me. I’m ashamed and frustrated that I didn’t know that stuff.”Feig said he met Weinstein only a handful of times, going to lunches and dinner with the powerful film producer to discuss a possible remake of the 2012 film “The Intouchables,” but Feig ultimately backed out after hearing stories about Weinstein from others in the industry.“I heard about Harvey and how hard he was to work with,” he said. “He was a screamer.”But rumors of sexual assault never made it to Feig, he said. Now that’s he’s aware of the stories, Feig said more powerful men need to speak out in support of the victims.“These women are enormously brave for coming out and I know this is the hardest thing in the world to come out like this, and it’s great. But they can’t do it alone. They need men speaking out.”Feig said he believes many people in his industry have been silent for fear of being known as a whistleblower, and harassment of all kinds can often be the norm for people trying to make it in the entertainment business. Others may be hesitant to automatically believe the accusers. Feig said he understands that impulse, but believes there’s enough documented evidence to support the allegations.“This is so despicable because Harvey is a gatekeeper,” Feig said. “Harassment is never excusable, but this makes it doubly horrible because he’s someone in power holding that power over people who want something from him and whom he can retaliate against if they go against his wishes.” Feig said he understands the harassment women face across all industries. When he directed the 2016 “Ghostbusters” remake, his all-female cast of heroes were constantly berated online.“Talk to any woman on Twitter who has any kind of a following and saying anything of importance,” he said. “Go into their feed and you will see horrendous shit. Whether it’s a reporter, a star, a writer, director ― they all have those tweets.”Weinstein is a symptom of a larger cultural crisis in which sexual assault has been normalized, Feig said. “What I want to say very loudly is that this is one monster that was found,” he said. “It’s not like we found the one guy; this is happening everywhere. It gets my blood boiling because this is against everything we’re trying to do. This is really, really wrong, so it’s good that somebody gets called out like this. A lot of powerful people need to get called out, and men have to speak out when this kind of thing happens.”"
36,POLITICS,Why Some Campaign Contributions Get Returned,"OpenSecrets Blog, ContributorPublished by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics an...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-some-campaign-contributions-get-returned_us_59dd2223e4b0b992a821478f,"by Andrew Mayersohn It’s been a big week for politicians refunding tainted campaign donations. First, Manhattan District",2017-10-10,"<p> NEW YORK, NY: Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and producer Harvey Weinstein attend the TIME 100 Gala </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59dd222a200000d8540861cc.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale," by Andrew Mayersohn It’s been a big week for politicians refunding tainted campaign donations.First, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. returned a $32,000 contribution from Donald Trump’s personal attorney Marc Kasowitz, who made the donation in 2013 after Vance decided not to pursue a fraud investigation against Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr.Now, at least a dozen Democrats have refunded or donated to charity contributions from media mogul Harvey Weinstein following a New York Times story alleging decades of sexual harassment.Refunds of campaign contributions are not rare, and most are not particularly scandalous. Losing campaigns often give back their leftover funds, although they are not legally obligated to. Some campaigns offer to refund supporters who have a change of heart, as former Sen. Arlen Specter (D-Pa.) did for his irate Republican backers when he switched parties in 2009, but that’s not required, either.Campaigns regularly issue refunds of contributions they can’t legally accept, such as donations from people who have already given the legal limit, an issue that plagued Marco Rubio’s presidential campaign. Some entities, such as federal contractors, are not permitted to make any contributions, which is why the pro-Hillary Clinton super PAC Priorities USA had to refund $200,000 to a construction company last June. Campaigns with millions of individual donors, such as Barack Obama’s or Bernie Sanders’, have to work hard to stay top of these issues and are in a constant state of back-and-forth with the Federal Election Commission.Occasionally, legally dubious contributions are not simply innocent mistakes by donors but concerted efforts to hide the source. Last year, the OpenSecrets Blogpartnered with The Boston Globe‘s Spotlight team to uncover a scheme by a Boston law firm to reimburse partners for their political donations, primarily to Democrats. Thornton Law Firm claimed that the arrangement was legal, but Massachusetts regulators disagreed. At least 30 candidates, including Hillary Clinton, subsequently either refunded the donations or forwarded them to the U.S. Treasury.The juiciest campaign finance scandals involve contributions from foreign nationals. In 1997, The Washington Post’s Bob Woodward and Brian Duffyrevealed that the Justice Department was investigating an effort by the People’s Republic of China to funnel contributions to President Bill Clinton’s reelection effort. Clinton had to return $640,000 (from his legal defense fund) that traced back to the head of a weapons company owned by the Chinese military, and the Democratic National Committee refunded $100,000 to a Chinese-American fundraiser who confessed to receiving the money from a lieutenant colonel in the People’s Liberation Army. Last year, the FEC prodded Donald Trump’s campaign to return several contributions from foreigners.Contributions from fraudsters are another headache for campaigns and a major source of refunds.When victims of financier Robert Allen Stanford’s Ponzi scheme tried to recover $1.6 million of his campaign contributions, they had to take five party committees to court to get them to cough it up. The refunds included about $1 million from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and about $260,000 from the National Republican Congressional Committee. However, many of Stanford’s contributions were too small to be worth suing over, including $4,600 given to Barack Obama, who never returned the money. Recipients of donations from an even more notorious source — Bernie Madoff — were quicker to donate to a victims’ fund. And in 2004, New Jersey Democrats gave to charity a fraction of the contributions they had received from real estate developer Charles Kushner, who had donated money in the names of his partnerships without authorization. Kushner subsequently served 14 months in prison but was a free man by 2015, when he and his wife made a $100,000 contribution to a super PAC supporting Donald Trump … the father-in-law of Kushner’s son Jared.Campaigns that purport to uphold a higher standard end up needing to return more contributions than most. Barack Obama’s campaign, for example, made it a point of pride not to accept contributions from registered lobbyists; consequently, it had to issue refunds to five lobbyist donors following an OpenSecrets Blog investigation.Finally, there are contributions, such as Weinstein’s, which are legal but politically toxic.If a controversial donation comes to light, politicians have to weigh their need for money against the bad press they would suffer by keeping it. In 2015, for example, three Republican presidential candidates returned contributions from the president of a white supremacist organization that was cited in the manifesto of the perpetrator of the Charleston church shooting. In contrast, Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens (R) not only kept $1 million from a venture capitalist accused of sexual abuse but even gave him a seat on stage at his inauguration. The presidential campaign and super PAC of Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R), on the other hand, returned $250,000 to the same donor.Sometimes the focus is on questionable contributions from committees rather than individuals. Whenever a member of congress is under investigation — for example, Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) — candidates who have received donations from the member’s leadership PAC face calls to return them. Companies involved in major scandal, such as Enron in 2001, also tend to see a flurry of contributions returned to their political action committees or forwarded to charity.Last cycle, candidates returned over $100 million in precious individual contributions, and this cycle is shaping up the same way. While the $1.4 million that Weinstein’s family has donated since 1990 is sizable by any standard, he wasn’t among last cycle’s top 500 donors. The next time a scandal hits one of the true mega-donors, however, watch how willing politicians are to let go of the tainted cash."

This has become the new normal. Reindeer are becoming more scarce in this part of western Greenland, as the species migrates north to cooler climates, said Knud, 27, the golden afternoon sun sinking westward toward the mouth of the fjord. It’s yet another sign of the climate change that has kicked into full gear in recent years. When reminded that the president of the United States refutes that the climate is changing as greenhouse gases enshroud the planet, people here generally raise their eyebrows, roll their eyes or laugh. Lyberth did all three. “It’s just, uh, wow,” he said with a laugh. “Here in Greenland we see it from day to day. There’s much fewer reindeer.”President Donald Trump’s refusal to acknowledge the basic science behind man-made climate change often appears as a sideshow to his administration’s assault on policies to reduce planet-warming emissions. In June, he announced the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, the global pact to cut emissions that every country except war-torn Syria has adopted. On Tuesday, his Environmental Protection Agency is set to unveil a proposal to repeal the Clean Power Plan, the signature federal policy for reducing planet-warming emissions from power plants that was enacted by the Obama administration.

Here on the world’s largest island, temperatures have climbed by 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to about 0.7 degrees Celsius ― or 1.3 degrees Fahrenheit ― worldwide. Locals have felt it.The most dramatic episode came in 2012, when the ice barrier containing a glacial lake burst, flooding the silty river that runs through Kangerlussuaq (pronounced KONG-guh-SHLOO-shwock). The river rose several feet, destroying the small bridge that connects the main part of the town ― where the airport is located ― to the dirt roads that lead to a research station, a landfill and a lakeside restaurant. “The water came up to here,” said Fritz Baumann, a local town official, his hand raised nearly a foot off the thick wooden bridge. The concept of denying climate change baffles former Greenland Premier Kuupik Kleist. “For the average Greenlander, there is no doubt that there is a very dramatic change going on,” Kleist said in an interview in his office in Nuuk, the capital. Kleist now serves as a commissioner on the Inuit Circumpolar Council, a nonprofit that advocates for the rights of indigenous peoples across the Arctic, including more say over policies to adapt to climate change. “It’s not like in the European or American capitals where you ask, ‘Is this for real or not?’” he added. “That’s a very stupid question in Greenland. We feel it, we see it, and we have to adapt to it.”Some people in Greenland stand to benefit as its towering ice walls retreat. The country, an autonomous region and former colony of the Kingdom of Denmark, has been furiously debating whether to mine the newly-reachable areas for rare earths metals and uranium. Extracting those resources threatens the pristine environment, but offers potential income streams that could provide jobs and help Greenland wean itself off the Danish subsidies it depends on to get by. Denmark has provided about $535 million in subsidies this year ― more than half of government revenues and 25 percent of Greenland’s gross domestic product. In a country where fishing exports fuel 90 percent of the economy, warming waters are luring lucrative fish species north, including mackerel and Atlantic bluefin tuna, which locals call “pink gold.” Less ice also means a longer hunting season and easier access for Orca whales, whose meat, blubber and skin provide prized delicacies to Inuit hunters. But traditional hunters in Greenland’s remote northern settlements are struggling, unable to safely drive their dog sleds out to islands on melting ice bridges. And there are scarier signs of the changing climate. In August, unprecedented wildfires burned in an area near Kangerlussuaq, wafting smoke over the airport, where Bibane Petersen, 26, works. As a native Greenlander whose ancestors have long survived by living off the land, she said she’s more sensitive to changes in the environment, and said the U.S. should elect a Native American, “someone who knows what’s going on on the Earth.” “It’s stupid that [Trump] doesn’t believe what’s so obvious,” said Petersen. “It’s a big mistake for him to be your president.

39,ENTERTAINMENT,Cheyenne Jackson Thinks 'American Horror Story' Has Never Been Scarier,Cole Delbyck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cheyenne-jackson-american-horror-story_us_59dd0a0be4b0b26332e721dc,A single text message from creator Ryan Murphy drew him back to the franchise.,2017-10-10,"Cheyenne Jackson as Dr. Vincent. in ""American Horror Story: Cult.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59dd184f2d000097173099c3.jpeg?cache=Ndfy5ogROU&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Beware! Spoilers lie ahead for “American Horror Story: Cult” Episode 5.After seven seasons, actor Cheyenne Jackson still finds “American Horror Story” downright terrifying. While his on-screen characters have braved a blood-soaked hotel and a Roanoke nightmare, nothing compares to the show’s current installment, which draws inspiration from perhaps the most horrific source material out there: the 2016 presidential election. With a single text from creator Ryan Murphy (yes, that’s all it takes), the Broadway star was back on board and eager to take a stab at playing another morally complex character. Jackson stars as Dr. Rudy Vincent, the psychiatrist to the clown-averse Ally (Sarah Paulson), perhaps the only person she can feel safe around as their nondescript Michigan hamlet descends into absolute chaos. But this is “American Horror Story,” so, of course, their relationship had to be tarnished, too. In the final moments of Episode 5, it was revealed that the good doctor might not be so good after all. Rudy, as it turns out, is the older brother of Kai (Evan Peters), aka the leader of the neighborhood clown cult responsible for a series of gruesome murders. HuffPost caught up with Jackson to weigh in on the political new season, that mother of a twist and whether the cast field trip to see Cher in Las Vegas was as fun as it looked.With two seasons under your belt, you’re a bonafide member of the “American Horror Story” family now. What compelled you to return this time around? Ryan has been steadfast and wonderful to me over the years. We met at a Broadway show that I was in, then he wrote for me on “Glee” and for years on “American Horror Story.” He just presents a character and you know it’s going to be amazing. You know it’s going to be different than what you’ve done before. You know it’s going to scare you, because there are going to be parts of yourself that are going to doubt that can you do it. Then you remember he thinks you can, which gives you this confidence. You just go for it and jump. How did Murphy pitch the character of Dr. Rudy Vincent to you? Was there any extra coaxing involved considering the material at hand? I believe it was one text, which is just so Ryan. It read, “Small-town psychiatrist and Sarah’s doctor. Brush up on your head shrinking.”Given how this season is reacting to such timely events, instead of drawing inspiration from historical periods like in “Hotel” and “Roanoke,” does it feel different for you? It is a departure, just given the nature of what we’re doing in our lives right now and where the world is. It feels very present and scarier. This is my third season on the show and it’s been my favorite experience. Everywhere I go and the people I talk to, the response I’m getting is much more tuned-in and fervent. People are really invested in these characters and the adventure that is [Ally’s] brain. What is happening to her? Who’s in on it? Is she crazy? Am I crazy? It’s just a lot. I think it fits right into the world of the anthology, but it does feel different to me. The series opens with Sara Paulson’s blood-curdling scream upon Trump’s victory, which, of course, many of us can relate to. Did you find some emotional resonance in that scene? We all kind of relived [the election], reading it, rehearsing it, shooting it and watching it. I know how Sarah personally [felt], and, of course how I felt, and regardless of what side of the aisle you were on, there was such high, pent-up emotion.If Kai is meant to be a Trumplike figure, do you think the series is attempting, in some way, to humanize or at least understand his supporters?Sure, but I think it’s broader than that. What I’m loving about the season is that nobody gets away unscathed. There were these really over-the-top reactions to the election on either side when the rest of us, even though we veer to one side, are probably more down the middle. It really does make you stop and think. We all live in our own bubbles, watch our own news programs and listen to our own radio stations. Sometimes for the hell of it I’ll watch Fox News because I just have to see what they’re talking about and how they’re wrapping their brain around the same thing I just saw. I think it’s important to see where everybody else is coming from, because if we all just stick in our own lane, nothing is ever going to get done. The twist at the end of Episode 5 was so major because it’s the first time we see someone who holds power over Kai. What can you tell me about their dynamic?It’s an interesting brother-brother relationship. You get a glimpse of how they were raised, but in upcoming episode you’ll see how Kai and Rudy came to be the way that they are. A doctor is a problem-solver. Both parents are dead? Well, that’s a problem. There’s a dexterity and a quickness with how he handles things. Their relationship is definitely fleshed out later in the season.On a personal level, Evan is probably my favorite actor [on the show] watching him over the years. This year, especially, we got such fun stuff, and he’s so inventive and with you in the moment. Every time I got scenes with him and Sarah I knew it was going to be an epic day at work. The material is, of course, inherently political this season, but what about the set? Is there a lot of talk of Trump and Hillary or do you need time to just decompress and escape when you’re not filming?We talk about it nonstop. How can you live in this world and not have opinions about things that are happening on a daily basis? That being said, on a show like this, everybody has their own way of dealing with the material and the intensity of the environment. A few people wanted to stay in character and do their own thing and others break from that and sing and dance to keep it light and then go and do the bloody, crazy stuff. From social media, it seems like the cast bonded off-screen as well. I need to know everything about that Cher concert. Cher was so crazy. I didn’t realize how much I wanted to see Cher until I was on my way to see Cher. There isn’t a bigger fan than Sarah, by the way. She was living. I don’t know if it’s just the group of people or the way we’ve bonded, but this is the most fun I’ve had doing the show. I’ve also relaxed a little more within the world and definitely given [myself] over to it. Now, we go to each other’s birthdays and to dinners, because a lot of times you don’t get a lot of scenes with each other. The cast is really tight. Would you consider returning for a Season 8? Oh, sure. Ryan sees things in you that you don’t even necessarily see in yourself. Five years ago, I never would have imagined myself on a show like this going toe-to-toe with these actors like Sarah that I thought at the time I have no business doing an emotional scene with. Now, every time I do a scene with her I get better because she demands that of you in the best way. If Ryan asked me to do anything, I’d do it. He knows that.

40,WORLD NEWS,Catalan Leader Backs Down From Declaring Immediate Independence From Spain,Nick Robins-Early,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/catalonia-declares-independence_us_59d4e1e8e4b06226e3f51183,President Carles Puigdemont requested more time for negotiations.,2017-10-10,"People hold on to Catalan separatist flags on top of an air vent during a demonstration two days after the banned independence referendum in Barcelona, Spain, October 3.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59d4e79f2d00009c17308965.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Spain watched intently on Tuesday as Catalonia’s president, Carles Puigdemont, gave a much-anticipated speech on whether the region would declare its complete independence and attempt to break away from the Spanish state. But as the political crisis grew over Catalonia’s independence bid, Puigdemont ended up not asking the autonomous region’s parliament to pursue an immediate vote on secession.Instead, Puigdemont said that although he has a mandate to declare independence, he is requesting that Catalan parliament suspend the results of its Oct 1. independence referendum to allow time for talks with Spain’s government. He added that he supports a Catalan state, but said he is delaying a formal declaration in favor of dialogue. The announcement was originally slotted for 6 p.m. local time, but was delayed for over an hour as last-minute deliberations took place. When Puigdemont eventually entered parliament, he gave a long oration on Catalan grievances against government attempts to stop independence.“We are not criminals, we are not mad. We are normal people, and we just want to vote,” Puigdemont said, switching from Catalan to Spanish for a moment to address those outside Catalonia.Puigdemont had been expected to issue a declaration since last week, when he announced that he would ask the regional parliament to vote on independence in the coming days. Anticipating the move, Spain’s constitutional court on Monday suspended the Catalan regional parliament’s voting session in a bid to deter Catalan lawmakers.Puigdemont appeared to be moving forward with his plans for unilaterally declaring independence, but he ultimately chose a more diplomatic route as both domestic and international pressure grew for him to reverse tack.The parliament session on Tuesday was the first since a contentious referendum on Oct. 1 saw Spanish law enforcement violently crack down on the vote.Scenes of riot police beating protesters and seizing ballot boxes drew international attention to Catalonia and spurred criticism of how Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy handled the independence movement. The violence also emboldened the separatist movement, giving them a public relations victory against the central government in Madrid.Both Rajoy and Spain’s courts regarded the referendum as illegal and did not recognize the result of the vote. In a rare political address last week, Spanish King Felipe VI also denounced the Catalan leaders and accused them of sowing division in the region. As Tuesday’s announcement approached, France added to the opposition, saying it would not recognize an independent Catalan state under current circumstances. Despite such warnings from the Spanish government and judiciary, Catalonia has persisted in its bid for independence ― but it’s unclear how many people in the region actually support that status. The government claimed that 90 percent of those who voted in the referendum favor leaving Spain, but the turnout only saw around 43 percent of eligible voters cast their ballots amid criticism of its legitimacy.In a shift from the massive independence rallies of recent weeks, tens of thousands of people rallied on Sunday in the Catalan capital of Barcelona to show their support for staying as part of the Spanish state. Demonstrators waved Spain’s national flag and held signs that proclaimed their affinity for both the Spanish and Catalan identities. The Spanish government still faces a significant crisis in how to deal with the separatist Catalan government, but for now has been given an opening to negotiate and avoid further violence. If Puigdemont had declared independence on Tuesday, Rajoy could have invoked a never-used provision of Spain’s Constitution, Article 155. The article would have allowed the government in Madrid to take away Catalonia’s autonomy. Article 155 states that the central government may take control of any region that seriously threatens Spain’s interests or violates its constitution.The political uncertainty over Catalonia’s push for independence has already begun to have a destabilizing effect on Spain. Major business, including Spain’s third-largest bank, have moved their headquarters out of the region in recent weeks. Catalonia has been largely autonomous since Spain transitioned to democracy following the death of dictator Francisco Franco in 1975, and the region has its own government, security forces and parliament. But separatists have long held that the region’s unique culture, language and economic success should enable it to fully separate from Spain."

But as the political crisis grew over Catalonia’s independence bid, Puigdemont ended up not asking the autonomous region’s parliament to pursue an immediate vote on secession.Instead, Puigdemont said that although he has a mandate to declare independence, he is requesting that Catalan parliament suspend the results of its Oct 1. independence referendum to allow time for talks with Spain’s government. He added that he supports a Catalan state, but said he is delaying a formal declaration in favor of dialogue. The announcement was originally slotted for 6 p.m. local time, but was delayed for over an hour as last-minute deliberations took place. When Puigdemont eventually entered parliament, he gave a long oration on Catalan grievances against government attempts to stop independence.“We are not criminals, we are not mad. We are normal people, and we just want to vote,” Puigdemont said, switching from Catalan to Spanish for a moment to address those outside Catalonia.Puigdemont had been expected to issue a declaration since last week, when he announced that he would ask the regional parliament to vote on independence in the coming days. Anticipating the move, Spain’s constitutional court on Monday suspended the Catalan regional parliament’s voting session in a bid to deter Catalan lawmakers.Puigdemont appeared to be moving forward with his plans for unilaterally declaring independence, but he ultimately chose a more diplomatic route as both domestic and international pressure grew for him to reverse tack.The parliament session on Tuesday was the first since a contentious referendum on Oct. 1 saw Spanish law enforcement violently crack down on the vote.Scenes of riot police beating protesters and seizing ballot boxes drew international attention to Catalonia and spurred criticism of how Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy handled the independence movement.

Now I know you’re a Dude Bro Man and you hate talking about feelings, but I gotta tell ya that in actuality you don’t hate talking about your feelings, in fact you live for the stuff (literally), you’ve just been socially conditioned as a Masculine Dude Bro Man to think that you hate talking about your feelings. You’ve been brainwashed, Dave, and I’m trying to help you.Thing is Dave, there is a culture in society that is killing men every single day. It is the culture of “man up”. A culture of “toughen up.” A culture that forces men to conceal their feelings and emotions so as to maintain that outer shell of masculinity. That outer shell that polarizes them from the ‘over emotional’ women that they share this imagined binary with. I know, messed up, isn’t it?This culture has to end, Dave, it’s gotta stop, and it is the responsibility of all of us to bring about its ending. All of us. Including you Dave. Lemme lay some stats down.Suicide is the biggest killer of men beneath the age of 45 in Britain. In 2013 it was recorded that there were 6,233 suicides in Britain, of which 78% were men and 22% were women. Despite this women are still more likely than men to suffer from mental illness, particularly anxiety disorders. Or, at least, that’s what data shows us. Data that is recorded via diagnosis. Data that is recorded via individuals speaking out about their experiences. If nobody shares their experiences, if nobody speaks up on their struggles or silent sufferings, then no data can be recorded. It is here the reason for this disparity becomes clear.Do you see it now Dave? Not talking about your feelings is killing people Dave. You think you’re being ‘tough’ or whatever, but you’re actually just perpetuating a deep set social norm that men who talk about their feelings are ‘pussys’ or whatever the hell you guys say to each other.Men do not talk about their mental health. Men do not talk about their feelings at all. And even if they do, it is usually done in such a way that it becomes jovial or dismissive. Women are encouraged to open up about their feelings and maintain a circle of sisterly friends that they frequently lean on (which in itself is a problem, but I’ll talk about that another time), whereas men are told to suck it up, to ‘man up’, to maintain an appearance of stoicism. This message is pushed by media in a variety of forms. Television, movies, video games, even the occasional news presenter on mainstream good morning shows (looking at you, Pr*ck Morgan)Movies are filled to the brim with hyper-masculine male leads who hide their problems as opposed to challenging them, and even worse a majority of them romanticise the notion of ‘drinking away’ your problems. Whilst this may make a poorly written fictional character ‘gritty’ and ‘interesting’, all it makes you is an alcoholic, Dave. You aren’t in a movie, you don’t exist in an ephemeral timeframe where you follow a singular narrative until completion, you are living a real life as a real human in real time. Meaning, put more simply, you’re a sentient mound of flesh and blood that needs help to function sometimes. And that is okay. Because it has to be okay. Because that’s how it is.Your brain is an organ, like all your other organs, and it needs help sometimes. There are tons of biological explanations for depression and anxiety, and I’d link you to a few except google is right there Dave I don’t have to do everything for you. The fact that mental illness has biological explanation means it is something individuals cannot help by ‘thinking positive’ or ‘manning up’. It’s patronising. It’s insulting. It’s bullsh*t, Dave, it really is. We both know it is.Can you imagine if we treated mental illness the way we treat physical illnesses? Oh, hey Cassidy, heard you got a tumour. That’s a real shame, but have you tried thinking about rainbows? Cassidy, don’t be selfish, give it a shot.Do you see, Dave? Cassidy can think of rainbows all she wants, she still has a third limb popping out of her torso. Amazingly, illnesses remain regardless of what pleasant meteorological phenomenons one may think of, or any other frivolous thought for that matter.So what can we do about mental illness? How do we help?Great question DaveWe help by encouraging those around us to share their feelings, and not judging them for it when they do. So if Phil hits you up with a text saying he feels like he’s purchased a one way ticket on the depresso expresso, hear him out, ask him if he’s alright, ask him if he thinks he needs to speak to someone. Just be a good friend Dave. And don’t call him a pussy either, you misogynistic tw*t.But In All Seriousness We need to destigmatise mental illness. We need to destigmatise talking about our feelings. We need to encourage openness, honesty, and reciprocity of sensitivity when it comes to these things, because until we do people are going to continue to suffer alone and in silence when all they ever needed to do is reach out to someone they felt they could trust and explain their situation.Suicide is entirely preventable, and it is on all of us to create a society where those suffering feel they can come forward and express themselves without fear of repurcussion.Now go tell your friends you love them, Dave, shout it loud and clear.No, not me, Dave, we don’t love each other.

Only the Chiba court decision last month did not find the government liable for compensation.The plaintiffs in Fukushima case have called on defendants for reinstating the levels of radioactivity at their homes before the disaster, but the court rejected the request, Kyodo said.Tepco has long been criticized for ignoring the threat posed by natural disasters to the Fukushima plant and the company and the government were lambasted for their handling of the crisis."

But the move appears to have cost taxpayers some $90,000 in flight expenses alone.A HuffPost analysis of flight times, distances and the fees the Air Force charges to fly a modified Boeing 757 that is used as Air Force 2 suggests that Vice President Mike Pence might been able to save taxpayers $89,193, had he flown directly from Las Vegas to Los Angeles rather than to the Indianapolis Colts’ home game in between.Pence’s office disputed that and similar analyses. “If the vice president did not go to Indiana for the Colts game, he would have flown back to D.C. for the evening ― which means flying directly over Indiana,” one senior Pence aide said on condition of anonymity. “Instead, he made a shorter trip to Indiana for a game that was on his schedule for several weeks.”Pence walked out of Lucas Oil Stadium Sunday after several players on the visiting San Francisco 49ers kneeled during the national anthem ― a gesture of protest against police brutality and racial disparities begun last year by the team’s former quarterback Colin Kaepernick.Within a few minutes, Pence sent a tweet: “I left today’s Colts game because @POTUS and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem.”That was followed an hour later by a tweet from Trump, who took credit for Pence’s walkout.“I asked @VP Pence to leave stadium if any players kneeled, disrespecting our country. I am proud of him and @SecondLady Karen,” Trump wrote.Democrats labeled the incident a “political stunt,” and critics of the Trump administration were quick to point out similarities to the recent revelations about various Cabinet officials using military planes and chartered jets for travel. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price wound up resigning his post in one such scandal.Pence, an Indiana native, is a longtime Colts fan, going back to his days as a talk radio host. He attended games as a congressman, and then as governor of Indiana.He had planned for weeks to attend Sunday’s game ― since long before Trump picked a fight with the NFL over the national anthem last month ― as part of a trip west to California for a mix of political fundraisers and official visits.Under that original plan, he would have flown from Washington, D.C., to Indianapolis Saturday night to be able to attend some local events the following morning before the game, and then continued out to Los Angeles following a ceremony honoring retired quarterback Peyton Manning at halftime.The total cost of those two flights would have been $71,948, according to a HuffPost calculation based on the Air Force schedule of “reimbursable rates” for its fleet for the 2018 budget year.After the Las Vegas shootings took place and Pence’s office decided to take part in a Saturday memorial service, the office had him fly to Indianapolis as he had already scheduled to do on Saturday night.After the San Francisco players kneeled, Pence returned to his hotel room before eventually heading to the airport for a flight to Los Angeles.That Pence and Trump were so quick to publicize the walkout led critics to wonder if the whole thing had been staged from the start. One of the TV reporters traveling with Pence reported that the traveling press had not been permitted into the stadium and had been told instead to wait in the van because Pence would possibly be leaving early.Pence’s office, though, denied that the stadium visit resulted in additional expenses. The vice president’s office argued that if Pence had simply flown out to Las Vegas and returned to Washington that night, the flights would have cost even more. Staying in Las Vegas overnight was out of the question, the argument goes, because of the burden it would have added to already stressed local law enforcement.But that explanation leaves out the possibility of Pence traveling from Las Vegas directly to Los Angeles, where he was already planning to spend Sunday night. Secret Service agents had already “advanced” that part of the trip, and it might have been possible to arrange for his arrival one day earlier than planned, had that work begun by the middle of last week when the rest of the Las Vegas trip was planned ― and by which point it could have been known with near certainty that 49ers players would kneel during the anthem.That flight from Las Vegas to Los Angeles would have taken only 45 minutes, at a cost of $11,587. By contrast, the flights from Las Vegas to Indianapolis, and then from Indianapolis to Los Angeles, totaled over six hours at a cost of $100,781, according to HuffPost’s estimate."

Instead, he praised players and owners “who have done the hard work over the past year to listen, understand and attempt to address the underlying issues within their communities” ― without specifying what he later termed “critical social issues.”He asserted that the kneeling “is threatening to erode the unifying power of our game, and is now dividing us, and our players, from many fans across the country.”“Like many of our fans, we believe that everyone should stand for the National Anthem,” he said. “It is an important moment in our game. We want to honor our flag and our country, and our fans expect that of us. We also care deeply about our players and respect their opinions and concerns about critical social issues. The controversy over the Anthem is a barrier to having honest conversations and making real progress on the underlying issues. We need to move past this controversy, and we want to do that together with our players.”The letter was sent to all 32 teams.Protests during the national anthem began last year when then-San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick kneeled while it played. Although Kaepernick, now a free agent, remains unsigned by any other team, many more players have taken a knee in solidarity ― an act that has led to harsh backlash by some, including President Donald Trump. During a rally last month in Alabama, Trump said of the kneeling protests: “Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. Out! He’s fired. He’s fired!’” That statement acted as a catalyst for the even more players to protest, and spurred some NFL owners to release statements disavowing the president’s commentary.But Goodell’s letter comes after Vice President Mike Pence last Sunday abruptly left a game in Indianapolis after several players on the visiting 49ers kneeled during the anthem.Pence tweeted that he left because neither he nor Trump will “dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem.” Minutes later, Trump tweeted that he had instructed Pence to leave the game if players knelt ― leading to speculation the vice president’s appearance was a “political stunt.”Later Sunday, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said he expected all players on his team to stand during the anthem, and that any member of the squad who “disrespects the flag” would be benched.Goodell ended his letter by saying he looks “forward to a full and open discussion of these issues” when the team owners meet in New York.“The NFL is at its best when we ourselves are unified,” he wrote.

He’s always underestimated.”The writer then recounted a restaurant meet-and-greet with Trump on the campaign trail, characterizing him as a steakhouse populist.“If these journalists took him more seriously, then maybe people will take them more seriously and they won’t be going so bankrupt,” he said.The compliments for the chief executive and criticism of the media perhaps helped to get Trump’s attention.

While MLK, for example, may be a fairly uncontroversial figure today, his approval rating was 32% positive and 63% negative in 1966.In 1961, 61% of Americans disapproved of the Freedom Riders.57% thought that sit-ins and “freedom buses” would do more to hurt than to help “the Negro's chances of being integrated in the South.”On the eve of the March on Washington, 60% of Americans held an unfavorable view of the demonstration.Yet, all of these events are today held widely in esteem.

In fact, a much more prevalent form of racism comes in the version of the individual who claims—and truly believes—not to be racist. Racism does not refer only to antagonistic beliefs and behavior, but also to beliefs and actions that produce and prolong injustice and inequality on a racial basis. These thoughts and actions do not have to be conscious, and you don’t have to be evil incarnate in order to perform them. (Yes, this means many—if not all—white people, including myself, hold some guilt here.)Many opponents of the Civil Rights Movement did not envision themselves to be racist either.

But let’s rewind again. A 1966 survey found that 85% of white respondents felt that protests actions by black Americans would hurt the advancement of civil rights. A survey three years later found that 70% of black respondents approved of the same protest actions an overwhelming 85% of white respondents said would be harmful.Looking back, it’s easy to feel that black respondents were right and that the white respondents were wrong. And surely we would’ve been in that righteous 15% of whites who didn’t disapprove… or would we?It’s worth noting that attitudes toward the NFL protests vary by race as well. According to a CBS/YouGov poll, only 28% of white respondents approved of NFL players protesting by kneeling during the National Anthem. Conversely, 74% of black respondents approved. The parallels we see in how Americans are responding to the NFL protests and how Americans responded to the Civil Rights Movement are more than uncanny, and the patterns tell us a story.The upshot of all if this is, if you don’t support the NFL players taking a stand now, you probably wouldn’t have supported MLK and his contemporaries a half-century ago.

52,IMPACT,International Day Of The Girl Child: Helping Girls Pursue Their Dreams,"Amb. Deborah L. Birx, M.D., ContributorU.S. Global AIDS Coordinator and U.S. Special Representative f...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/international-day-of-the-girl-child-helping-girls_us_59dd0e79e4b0b992a821476b,On the International Day of the Girl Child – and every day – the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR,2017-10-10,<p>Smiling primary school students in Ethiopia</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59dd0ecb2d00005c173099a7.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On the International Day of the Girl Child – and every day – the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) celebrates the extraordinary power and potential of girls around the world, and we reaffirm our commitment to helping them pursue their dreams.Empowering, supporting, and protecting girls is critical to controlling and ultimately ending the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Unless we deliver for girls, we will not succeed. This means understanding the unique challenges faced by girls and developing creative solutions to address them.Over the past three and a half years, PEPFAR has taken these challenges head-on. In 2014, we partnered with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Girl Effect, Johnson & Johnson, Gilead Sciences, and ViiV Healthcare to launch DREAMS (Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-free, Mentored, Safe). Driven by data, we have rolled out an unprecedented and comprehensive package of interventions in the highest-burden areas of 10 African countries.We have seen girls step up as leaders in their communities to speak openly about their risks for HIV and embrace programs to reduce them. We have seen parents gain the skills to talk honestly with their daughters (and sons) about HIV and other health issues affecting their lives. We have witnessed community and faith leaders dedicating themselves to changing harmful gender norms that contribute to the vulnerability of girls and young women.According to results from PEPFAR’s Population-based HIV Impact Assessments (PHIAs) in Lesotho, Malawi, Swaziland, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, we are approaching epidemic control among older adults in these countries. Yet the PHIAs also reveal key gaps for young women and men under age 35 who are significantly less likely to be tested, on treatment, and/or virally suppressed than those over age 35. And girls remain up to 14 times more likely to be infected with HIV than boys of their same age. With the rising population of adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa and a persistent cycle of HIV transmission between adolescent girls and young women and men 8-10 years older, we still have much work to do.This year, for the first time, we integrated our DREAMS programs (which were previously funded centrally) into our annual Country Operational Plans, making DREAMS a core component of PEPFAR programs in the 10 original DREAMS countries. The DREAMS Innovation Challenge is also fully operational, supporting new ideas and approaches, many at the community level, to reach and support adolescent girls and young women. We also expanded DREAMS-like programming into Botswana, Cote D’Ivoire, Haiti, Namibia, and Rwanda.Our private sector partners remain central to the success of DREAMS, bringing their unique capacities and capabilities to the table. For example, Girl Effect conducted extensive research to understand the context of relationships between boys and girls in Malawi and what kind of messaging would resonate most with adolescents. It found that relationships between boys and girls are highly sexualized in Malawi, and society often discourages boys and girls from being platonic friends, which puts girls at greater risk. Girl Effect created a youth brand called “Zathu” (meaning “ours”) that aims to close the gender gap through the power of music and storytelling, tackling challenging topics such as relationships, confidence, and friendships between girls and boys.In some countries, risk starts early in girls’ lives. They too often face the threats of harmful initiation rites, non-consensual or forced sex, transactional sex, and early marriage. PEPFAR funds the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to implement Violence Against Children surveys, which reveal that, in some countries, one in three girls’ first sexual encounter is forced or coerced. This level of risk is wholly unacceptable. That is why we are significantly expanding our efforts to prevent sexual and gender-based violence and help young people delay their age of sexual debut. Every girl should have a life free of violence.We have made important gains for girls, but we must continue to follow the data and build on the lessons we have learned to do more and do it better, including through implementation of the new PEPFAR Strategy for Accelerating HIV/AIDS Epidemic Control. How can we link more girls to higher education, job training, and entrepreneurship opportunities to ensure their economic security? How can we change harmful norms on a wider scale so that a young woman can seek services without fear or judgement?Preventing HIV among adolescent girls and young women is our ultimate goal, and that means walking with them every step along the way, pursuing the equality and respect that every girl around the world deserves."

Sonoma County bore the brunt of the fatalities, with seven fire-related deaths confirmed there, according to the sheriff’s department. Two people died in Napa County and one in Mendocino County, officials said.

Scientists say the frequency and severity of natural disasters like these are linked to climbing global temperatures. But the Trump administration on Tuesday announced plans to repeal the United States’ only major policy to combat climate change. The Clean Power Plan ― a set of Obama-era regulations aimed at slashing emissions from coal-fired power plants and boosting renewable energy production ― had yet to go into effect, after being temporarily blocked by the Supreme Court since February 2016. On Tuesday afternoon, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt ― who sued to halt the plan last year when he was Oklahoma’s attorney general ― released a proposal to eliminate the policy without any replacement, leaving the country without a national strategy to adapt to global warming.The announcement came in the wake of 15 wildfires in Northern California that left 15 dead and incinerated 1,500 homes and businesses, forcing thousands to flee. Rain soaked the state last winter, stacking its mountains with colossal snowdrifts and quenching soil left parched after more than half a decade of historic drought. But record-breaking heat baked the West in July and August, drying its woodlands and leaving it vulnerable to the sort of blaze now engulfing the wine-producing region neighboring San Francisco. “It’s nauseatingly smoky,” said Joseph Majkut, the climate policy director at the Niskanen Center, a libertarian think tank that works on convincing Republicans to take human-caused global warming seriously. “These people have either no sense or a very sophisticated sense of irony to be doing this at this time,” he added, referring to the Trump administration. Following an exceptionally hot summer, 172 fires ― 78 of which qualified as “large” incidents according to the National Interagency Fire Center ― burned more than 8 million acres in western Montana and the Pacific Northwest.

Ricardo Rosselló has asked Congress for more than $4 billion in federal relief aid following Hurricane Maria, in a letter dated on Saturday. Rosselló shared the three-page letter he sent to congressional leaders, and a similar letter he wrote to President Donald Trump, via Twitter on Monday. “Puerto Rico has suffered an unprecedented catastrophe that has largely destroyed our physical infrastructure, including our electrical and telecommunications systems, impaired our public health facilities, and gravely limited the ability of our central and municipal governments to meet basic human needs,” Rosselló wrote.He said that destruction caused by the hurricane nearly three weeks ago “led to independent damage assessments in the range of $95 billion” on the island where about 3.4 million people live. “Financial damages of this magnitude will subject Puerto Rico’s central government, its instrumentalities, and municipal governments to unsustainable cash shortfalls,” Rosselló said. “As a result, in addition to the immediate humanitarian crisis, Puerto Rico is on the brink of a massive liquidity crisis that will intensify in the immediate future.”Rosselló thanked the federal government for the assistance it’s provided so far, but stressed that without “extraordinary measures to address the halt in economic activity in Puerto Rico, the humanitarian crisis will deepen.” He also warned that the demise of the island’s economy would lead to a mass exodus to the U.S. mainland.This week, the House is expected to consider the Trump administration’s request for a $29 billion aid package to assist states and U.S. territories that have been struck by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria and recent wildfires.Rosselló on Monday also told CBS News correspondent David Begnaud that he wants the federal government to, once again, waive the Jones Act. The 1920 act imposes steep shipping costs on the U.S. territory and was waived for 10 days so the island could import aid at a lower cost. The waiver ended on Sunday night and Department of Homeland Security spokesman David Lapan told HuffPost “it is not being extended at this time.”“I think we should have all the tools that we have at hand,” Rosselló told Begnaud in an Instagram video on Monday night. “In this emergency phase when we are looking to sustain and save lives — we should have all the assets at hand.”As of Tuesday morning, 84 percent of the island was without power, more than 67 percent of cell towers were not working and just over 36 percent of residents did not have access to drinking water."

It’s not for lack of effort.,2017-10-10,"Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook, delivers a speech during a visit in Paris on Jan. 17, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59dbe000200000654d085e44.jpeg?cache=jLTU1bOM3s&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As the Trump administration rolls back progress for women on equal pay, birth control and Title IX, you’d think perhaps the corporate world ― which provides a lot of lip service on feminism ― would offer up some glimmer of hope when it comes to gender equality.Nope.Women’s progress in the job world is stalling ― even moving backward ― according to a major survey released Tuesday by the nonprofit women’s group LeanIn.org and consulting firm McKinsey & Co.For the third year in a row, the survey has found that women are underrepresented at every level in corporate America, with fewer and fewer ascending the corporate ladder. Forty-seven percent of entry-level workers are women, according to the data, but only 37 percent are managers. Just 29 percent of vice presidents are women, and women make up 20 percent of C-suite executives (those jobs that have the word “chief” in the title).These numbers are virtually unchanged from 2016, and are either stalled or up only slightly since 2015, when LeanIn, the women’s group cofounded by Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, released its first study. In 2015, women had 17 percent of C-suite jobs. The number of female senior vice presidents has actually declined to 21 percent from the previous two years.“It’s a sad story,” Rachel Thomas, the president and cofounder of LeanIn, told HuffPost. “We’re far from parity, and progress is way too slow.” For women of color, the numbers are devastating. While 17 percent of entry-level employees are women of color, they comprise just 3 percent of executives in the C-suite. “Women of color pay for double-discrimination,” Thomas said.Women of color get even less support and mentoring from their senior colleagues than white women, the study found. Yet the research also suggests that women of color are more ambitious than their white counterparts.For years now, women have shouldered a lot of the blame for their lack of success in climbing the corporate ladder and shattering the glass ceiling. Indeed, the title of one of the most successful books about women in business is “Lean In,” putting the onus on women to act. But even the LeanIn group agrees that, at this point, “leaning in” isn’t the problem. “Women are stalling because we have age-old stereotypes about women and men,” Thomas said.This year’s study was conducted in three parts: First, 222 companies with at least 1,000 U.S. employees shared so-called “pipeline data” ― breakdowns of employees by sex and race at different points on the career ladder, including entry-level, managerial, senior executive and C-suite employees.Separately, human resource teams within those organizations filled out a survey about policies and practices. Finally, 70,000 workers at 82 participating companies filled out a more detailed survey.According to this year’s study ― and counter to the conventional wisdom ― women ask for promotions and raises at the same rate as men. In fact, women at the senior level ask more frequently. Yet women are 18 percent less likely to get promoted, according to the findings. What’s going on? Thomas points to research that shows that women are underestimated at work and men are overestimated.But you only need to look at presidential politics to intuitively grasp this dynamic. If President Donald Trump holds a press conference without insulting anyone, he’s hailed as presidential. Meanwhile, if former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton writes about her election loss and doesn’t spend 100 percent of the time apologizing for losing, she’s viewed as a sore loser.This difference in how men and women are viewed shows up in performance reviews and keeps women from advancing, Thomas said. “Women are playing on an uneven playing field,” she said.Women are also less likely to get advice from senior leaders on how to move up and are less likely to to interact with senior leaders at their companies ― two surefire strategies to schmooze your way up.Part of the reason for the lack of interaction has to do with bias: Men are more likely to help out other men, because they see themselves in their younger peers.Men are also increasingly hesitant to offer one-on-one mentoring to women, as awareness of sexual harassment and discrimination creates a fear (unfounded) that mixed gender interactions are risky.The LeanIn study challenges another assumption about why women don’t advance: the idea that we drop out of the workforce to care for children. Fewer than 2 percent of survey respondents ― women and men ― said they planned to leave the workforce to devote themselves to their families. “The age-old conventional wisdom that women are leaving to focus on family. We’re just not seeing that in our data,” Thomas said.But parenting does affect women’s careers in other ways, Thomas points out. Women are likely more overworked because they do more work at home. Fifty-four percent of women said they do all or most of the household work, compared with 22 percent of men, according to LeanIn’s survey. This could lead to less of a desire to advance up the ladder, Thomas said. "

We fake enthusiasm. We fake patience. We fake our energy and act excited to play with our kids and go places with them when we really just want to lie down and nap. We lie often because it’s easier than explaining the truth. It’s just part of the job, and everyone has to do it. I think part of being a parent is feeling like a fraud. When do we feel like a parent? Or is it something we just are? We hear the words “real dad” or “real mom” often used to refer to someone who is a good parent. Real dads help out around the house, real moms take their kids to soccer, etc. A real parent can also refer to a biological parent, which makes stepparents the biggest frauds of all.But what makes a stepparent any different? The answer is, not much. The difference is how you feel. Biological parents will always have a different sense of ownership while stepparents may not. They’ve known their child longer and have seen them grow from the start. That is my kid, they will always be able to say. But that doesn’t mean they function any differently. You’re just made to feel off because you’re the other, not the primary.I used to say to my wife that I felt nothing I did counted. Sometimes I didn’t say it bitterly, I said it humbly because I couldn’t accept praise just yet. I couldn’t accept that I was taking on the role of a parent. I wasn’t faking anything, I was just doing it. It didn’t help that once he learned what I was, that I was his stepdad, he also realized what I wasn’t. I wasn’t his dad.When I pick him up from school, his friends say, “Your dad’s here.”He corrects them, sometimes angrily, “That’s not my dad, that’s my stepdad.”The distinction is important to him, as titles and names always are to children, maybe even more so than as adults. It can hurt sometimes, but at least he recognizes me as a parent. I’m lucky to have him as young as I do. I met him before he turned three. He will always remember me and I don’t have to worry about him seeing me as an imposter, someone stepping into his life and trying to take on the role of father.Along with worrying about being the real father, I worry about being a real man. Every man does, especially in an age where gender is evolving so fluidly that calling yourself a man is more important than defining what a man is. I think this evolution is great, because at some point I’ve always felt like I didn’t fit into the archetypal male, but I’ve been able to blend in just as well.What’s a real man do with his son? Do they camp, fish, play ball (all things I don’t do), or do teach them to read, write, and talk about art? My dad was a carpenter, a computer programmer, and someone who wasn’t particularly athletic or enjoyed sports, but liked being active. He was manly and tough at times, sensitive and kind during others. He could be hard on us, especially if we defied the things that he valued, among them, family, humility and good manners. He kept us in check and came down hard when he needed to, but his temper was never a constant thing we had to deal with. He was not filled with rage like so many other men are. He was caring of our pain and never told us to suck it up.My grandfather also raised me. We lived on a farm next to him and my grandmother and spent a lot of time together. He came from a different generation, one where a man was a man and you didn’t talk about your problems. He was the CEO of an insurance company, a conservative and highly successful man who prized money-making over creative endeavors. He was terse, stern, and short-tempered. He took us on road trips to museums, vacations in the Cayman Islands, and was always excited to have us help out on the farm. He was like a coin you could flip to either side: one was fun and concerned, the other was angry and disapproving.Most of the time when I think about these two fathers, I don’t feel too critical. I think about the good parts of them, how they were both two different types of men. Most of the time I find myself lucky to have had their influence. I see it come out in me as a parent. I talk similarly and use the same tones. I have to keep myself in check. I sometimes get angry at him for crying and then have to tell myself that he’s just a kid, he’s going to cry and that’s okay. He’s going to get scared at night and while it might seem silly to me, it’s not silly to him.I’m thankful for their influence because it taught me both what to do and what not to do. I think most people fall into two, detrimental extremes: they do everything they can to not be like their parents or they do everything the same way their parents did. I think it’s good to fall somewhere between. It’s okay to want to be like your dad because he’s what you thought a man was. It’s not okay to feel like you have to be like him. We all pick up good and bad traits, but I think ultimately the good traits shine above the bad ones.Being a man doesn’t have to be defined by what it is not, or what other people tell you it is. The same goes for being a parent. It should be up to you to decide for yourself what it means. If there is anything I have learned is that it’s not my job to teach my stepson how to be a man. It’s not my job to tell him what a man is and it’s not anyone else’s job to tell me whether or not I’m a parent. I know what I am, even if sometimes I don’t feel like it. I’m a parent. I’m a man. I’m a stepdad. As for my stepson, he’s whatever he wants to be.Previously published as ‘On Being a Real Dad’ in James’s OTHER FATHER column in The Wild Word magazine. www.thewildword.comFor more great Wild Word essays see:Why We Need to Break the Silence on Gun Control by M.L.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59dc8f6e2d000097173097e5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A British actress became the latest woman to come forward about an uncomfortable interaction with Harvey Weinstein. Describing the experience as “humiliating” and “extremely problematic,” Romola Garai said that the Hollywood mogul invited her to his hotel room for an audition, and then answered the door in his bathrobe.Garai said that she felt “violated” by Weinstein, who was fired from his namesake company this weekend in the wake of numerous sexual harassment allegations.“Like every other woman in the industry, I’ve had an ‘audition’ with Harvey Weinstein, where I’d actually already had the audition but you had to be personally approved by him,” the actress told The Guardian. “So I had to go to his hotel room in the Savoy, and he answered the door in his bathrobe. I was only 18. I felt violated by it, it has stayed very clearly in my memory.”Garai’s story mirrors claims made by other women in Hollywood about Weinstein, which begin with an invitation to his hotel room and result in an encounter that was either explicitly or implicitly sexual.“The transaction was just that I was there,” said the actress, who has appeared in such films as “Atonement” and “Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights.” “The point was that he could get a young woman to do that, that I didn’t have a choice, that it was humiliating for me and that he had the power. It was an abuse of power.”Although she sensed that it was “weird,” she said she tried to brush it off since she viewed it as a job interview. “I didn’t feel like I had the right to complain.”Garai said that she isn’t surprised that the allegations against Weinstein were made public.“You can’t find an actress that doesn’t have that kind of story about Harvey,” she said. “Given how powerful he is, and given that they are always with women who are a lot younger than him, I think there is clearly an imbalance of power in those relationships.”The New York Times published a bombshell report Thursday revealing decades of abuse allegations against Weinstein, including from former staffers and actresses like Ashley Judd and Rose McGowan. The Times reported that Weinstein had reached at least eight financial settlements with the women.More women have since come forward, including television journalist Lauren Sivan, who told HuffPost that Weinstein once cornered her and masturbated in front of her in a New York restaurant.A number of celebrities, mostly women, have also spoken out against Weinstein and the culture that enabled his behavior for years.“Abuse, threats and coercion have been the norm for so many women trying to do business or make art,” Lena Dunham wrote in The New York Times. “Mr. Weinstein may be the most powerful man in Hollywood to be revealed as a predator, but he’s certainly not the only one who has been allowed to run wild. His behavior, silently co-signed for decades by employees and collaborators, is a microcosm of what has been happening in Hollywood since always and of what workplace harassment looks like for women everywhere.”"

Weinstein has produced countless award-winning movies, many of which have been honored at awards shows to which the actresses in those movies have worn Marchesa gowns. In a 2007 New York Times article, Ruth La Ferla compared Chapman and Craig’s fast success to something of a fairy tale: Two designers “with no fashion credentials to boast of” quickly became a red carpet mainstay after Renée Zellweger opted to wear a dress of their design to the London premiere of “Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason” in 2004. The movie was produced by Miramax, Weinstein’s production company at the time.He has previously dismissed the idea that actresses wear the label to get in his good graces.

However, that grossly underestimates",2017-10-10,<p>Tasting at the Pierre Hotel with Charles Masson of Majorelle.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59d0fb3014000025004927ca.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Some people eat to live, but most of us live to eat. Dining is not only an integral part of our existence, but both special and ordinary moments also take place during meals. When you have a food allergy, dining experiences have a different flavor—these customers need to ensure that what they eat will also let them live. Dining out, therefore, can be daunting because trusting an unknown kitchen (chef, food preparers, service staff) outside of your home is scary. There is hope, however, as more restaurants, especially those with discerning and talented chefs, see the food allergy customer as an opportunity, even a challenge, to deliver their brand of culinary rapture to a customer who rarely experiences anything beyond the bland or familiar. Each year at the NYC Food Allergy Ball which raises funds for Food Allergy Research & Education (FARE), we bestow a lifetime achievement award to an outstanding chef or restaurateur who has demonstrated their commitment to excellence and compassion for the food allergy community by training their staff to be food allergy aware. The honored Chef creates a special menu for the event that represents their passion for food, and that is free of tree nuts, peanuts, shellfish, or any oils or derivatives of these foods (gluten-free and vegan (dairy-free, egg-free) options are available upon request). As co-chair of this year’s Food Allergy Ball, I was privileged to participate in a tasting – where we sampled dishes cooked by our honored chef and selected the choices we thought our audience of 400 plus guests would enjoy. The tasting is special because the planners of this event get to sit and talk with the honoree. This year’s honoree is Charles Masson of the restaurant Majorelle in New York City. I was in for such a treat as the food was not merely delectable, but the beauty of the dishes and the stories behind them gave rise to an unexpected delightful sensory dining experience.I was riveted as Charles spoke of his family, his history, how art (specifically painting) influenced his ingredient choices and plating of food. He spoke about mixing colors, shapes, and textures to produce visual joy. The dishes that he served us were indeed an edible work of art, heightening our pleasure before we savored a single bite. One of the dishes ultimately selected was an endive leaf with chopped root celery remoulade. As he explained to us how it was crafted, I was impressed by the thought, care, planning and creativity that went into creating a single dish. I had never thought of food as art before. But if the analogy is true, our chef is Picasso. Charles spoke about his desire to delight and nourish all patrons. Precautions must be undertaken to provide sustenance to a customer with a food allergy, including training all staff in allergy awareness, using separate utensils, cookware and undertaking rigorous ingredient checks. Our chef is not daunted by any of them. When you walk into Majorelle, from your greeting, to your table side service, all the way to dessert, you can be certain your food allergy will be taken seriously. The restaurant is upscale, but that can be a good fit for a special occasion dinner for someone with food allergies. The personalized attention brings the comfort of knowing, the staff here care as much about your safety as the taste and beauty of the cuisine.There are many restaurants that simply don’t want food allergic customers at the table. Some restaurants post signs in their windows saying “We can’t guarantee your safety here with food allergies”, put disclaimers on the menus and even encourage you in not so subtle words to leave. Such attitudes are both financially shortsighted and woefully out of touch with customer needs. Food allergic customers are the most loyal patrons any restaurant could wish for.The chefs and restaurateurs honored at the past Food Allergy Ball are amongst the best in the world. They are not intimidated by food allergy. Indeed, their talent is what allows them to reinvent a dish that is safe for food allergy diners. While other chef’s stick to their culinary dogma and do not welcome food allergy customers, these chefs take up the challenge and create mouthwatering masterworks. Past honorees make up an impressive list that includes Gabriel Kreuther, Mario Carbone, Rich Torrisi, Jeff Zalaznick, Geoffrey Zakarian, Nick Valenti, Ming Tsai, Alfred Portale, Tom Colicchio, Emeril Lagasse, Marcus Samuelsson, Jacques Pépin, Alain Sailhac, André Soltner, Danny Meyer, Mario Batali, Thomas Keller, David Bouley, Daniel Boulud, Drew Nieporent, Alex von Bidder, Julian Niccolini, and Sirio Maccioni.There are 15 million Americans estimated to suffer from life threatening food allergies. However, that grossly underestimates the number of potential diners. In our extended family, when we choose a restaurant to celebrate, its over 20 of us who dine. If it’s not safe for my food allergic son, it’s off the table for consideration. Paul Antico who runs the website Allergy Eats once told me he calls this the “veto vote”. The person with the food allergy actually determines which restaurant will be selected. Today’s consumers have many restaurant choices, and a study shows that 70% of restaurant customers never make a return visit. Restaurants that nourish and make a food allergy customer feel safe often instantly create repeat customers. Repeat business is vital to both a restaurants’ success and longevity. So, it would be wise for other restaurateurs to emulate our honored chefs and restaurateurs and set a place for us at the table. "

Pesquera, secretary of the Puerto Rico Department of Public Safety, described the circumstances of the three added deaths during a press conference Sunday afternoon. He said he did not expect the final death toll to reach the hundreds and declined to address media reports of dozens of unaccounted dead.One of the three newly counted deaths occurred in Dorado, 15 miles west of San Juan. The man’s decomposed body was brought to the Institute of Forensic Science in San Juan on Oct. 6. Mud and debris were found in the body’s organs, and it was determined that he had died by drowning in the Plata river during the storm.The other two deaths occurred in San Juan. One person was found under the wooden rubble of a house that had collapsed on Saturday. The other person, who died on Thursday, was thought to be an indirect victim of the storm.“She lost her home and she was depressed,” Pesquera told reporters on Sunday (HuffPost obtained an audio recording from the Department of Public Safety). “She had a strong pain in her chest. When they do the autopsy, we’ll come to the conclusion of the cause of death. However, during interviews with family members, they say it happened because she was depressed and apparently she mixed a series of pills.”Karixia Ortiz, press officer for the Department of Public Safety, confirmed the circumstances of the three deaths to HuffPost on Monday. She also addressed why it’s taken so long to ascertain the number of deaths since Hurricane Maria slammed into the island nearly three weeks ago.Every death must be confirmed by the Institute of Forensic Science, which means either the bodies have to be brought to San Juan to do an autopsy or a medical examiner must be dispatched to the local municipality to verify the death, Ortiz explained.“We try to consult all of the parties who can consult in the analysis of deaths related directly or indirectly to the hurricane,” Ortiz said. “But it’s a complicated process because you have to contextualize the death. Just because a person dies in the days following the hurricane doesn’t mean the death is connected to the hurricane, because every day people in Puerto Rico and all over the world die, including from health complications.”“We’ve always tried to be very careful with the certification of deaths because we want to have all the scientific proof and verifiable evidence that if a person dies as a consequence of the hurricane, that it can be proved,” she continued.The process has been complicated by the storm damage to numerous roads and the lack of communication on the island. As of Monday, only 51 percent of the island had telecommunication service and less than 29 percent of cell towers were functioning. Ortiz said mayors have received satellite phones to help them communicate with officials in San Juan.“We exhaust all resources when it comes to communication ― phone, satellite phone, sending runners,” she said.On Sunday, reporters asked Pesquera about media reports of unaccounted deaths in remote areas of the island. Funeral directors in two towns told BuzzFeed News that they have significantly more bodies than the government counted in a “certified” death toll. A week after the storm, journalist Omaya Sosa Pascual, working for the Center for Investigative Journalism, reported there were dozens of deaths due to lack of medical resources that had gone untallied and wrote of morgues in remote places “at capacity.” She reported on Monday that most of the deaths in Puerto Rico since Hurricane Maria have likely not been examined yet.Pesquera neither confirmed nor denied these claims on Sunday.“There’s no backlog in bodies,” he said of the deaths that have been reported to the Institute of Forensic Science. “As they are coming in, they are coming out relatively quickly. What there is is bodies that are being kept because the funeral home or the family, for different reasons, can’t pick them up. So we are keeping them there.”“I don’t think there will be hundreds of deaths, but we will see,” he added. “We can’t speculate if there will be 100 or 200. I’m telling you what we’ve seen. We haven’t seen anything that’s going to skyrocket.”Still, the death toll, which had stood for days at 16, jumped to 34 last Tuesday. By Friday, it was 36. Pesquera said the big jump last week came “as a consequence of not having information for two weeks” and because bodies “could not get there” ― that is, to the Institute of Forensic Service.When journalists pushed Pesquera about the rumors that the death toll could eventually reach the hundreds, he maintained that he could only speak to what the institute has reported.“I hope not, I sincerely hope not,” he said about the possibility of a death count in the triple digits. “But I’m not gonna speculate. I don’t care what’s circulating. I care about what the institute can certify. There are all kinds of rumors out there floating around. We don’t deal with rumors; we deal with facts.”"

While speaking at a TimesTalk panel with fellow chef Danny Bowien and moderator Kim Severson last week, Bourdain had harsh words for critics that tell him to stay in his lane and speak only about food. “Fuck that. Fuck that. Is there anything on this planet more political than food? No there is not,” Bourdain said, before offering up examples of what makes food so political. “Who eats? Who doesn’t eat? Who is cooking? Why are we eating the things that we eat? What got us to this point that we are eating a lot of pickles or dried and preserved food? What does this tell us about, you know, ourselves? Who is picking the produce? Who is cutting the meat? Who is shipping the meat? Who is putting it in the boxes?” he said.Bourdain added, “There is nothing more political than that. So every time I hear that online and I hear it a lot, you know, “Stick with food, man. Stop talking about politics.” Head to minute 13 to hear the remarks from Bourdain himself: During the talk, Severson also brought up two chefs who are known for voicing their political views: José Andrés and Tom Colicchio. Andres has been an outspoken opponent of President Donald Trump since 2015. The chef backed out of a deal to have one of his restaurants in Trump’s Washington, D.C hotel after the now-president called Mexicans “rapists” and “criminals.” “More than half of my team is Hispanic, as are many of our guests,” he said in a statement at the time. “And, as a proud Spanish immigrant and recently naturalized American citizen myself, I believe that every human being deserves respect, regardless of immigration status.” Andrés is currently in Puerto Rico helping feed thousands of people who were affected by Hurricane Maria. The Trump administration has been criticized for its lack of response and downplaying the aftermath of the hurricane.Along with Bourdain and Andrés, Tom Colicchio of “Top Chef” fame regularly criticizes Trump and his administration on Twitter: Good luck to anyone who wants these chefs to stay quiet.

But we’re sitting around a crowded table in a ballroom filled with other crowded tables, and every single person there is in the business of battling the patriarchy. This is the northwest regional #IStandWithPP Organizing Summit ― essentially, Planned Parenthood activist bootcamp.“We’re everywhere. We’re in the reddest place, and we’re in the bluest place,” Elaine Rose, CEO of Planned Parenthood Votes Northwest and Hawaii (PPVNH) declared from the center of a stage at the Bellevue Hyatt, that night. “You’re gonna go home and help change the world.”She’s speaking to Pyhala and the other 330+ women, men and gender non-conforming people sitting in a hotel ballroom just outside of Seattle, Wash. on a Friday night. Each person there is one of Planned Parenthood’s top volunteers, and they traveled from around the western part of the United States ― from states like South Dakota, California, Montana and Alaska ― to spend the weekend learning how to “change the world” more effectively. (Similar summits took place in Oklahoma City, Charlotte and Phoenix. When the program is wrapped, about 1,000 volunteers will have gone through the training program.)The goal of these summits, which are the first of their kind for Planned Parenthood, is lofty, but simple: To build out the foundations for 600 effective, intersectional, local action groups ― all in places where a Planned Parenthood health center exists. The hope is that these 600 action groups will be able to activate locally around the issues that impact each community most directly, whether that’s abortion access, or police brutality, or comprehensive sex education, or DACA, or an anti-trans bathroom bill, or all (or none) of the above.Although the organization is most visibly associated with reproductive rights, specifically access to abortion care, Planned Parenthood National Organizing Director Kelley Robinson stressed that the organization sees “any attack on the people that come through a Planned Parenthood health center’s doors [as] a direct attack on our ability to provide care.”“We’ve been around for 100 years through the work of folks really believing in grassroots organizing,” said Robinson. “But now, in this moment, especially as we’re in our second century, it’s been really critical for us to understand that the only way that we’re really going to win is by training our volunteers across the country.” In Bellevue, those volunteers looked like a diverse cross-section of America ― albeit a little younger, a little more tattooed, and wearing a little more pink.* * *It’s been quite a year for Planned Parenthood. The health care organization has long been a target of right-wing legislators, having become one of the most potent symbols of America’s sustained battle over abortion access. With the election of President Donald Trump, alongside a Republican-led House and Senate, Planned Parenthood’s leaders and supporters knew the organization would likely continue to face sustained attacks. And it has. Both the failed American Health Care Act (AHCA) and Graham-Cassidy bill would have “defunded” Planned Parenthood. Trump signed a bill allowing states to withhold federal funding from places that provide abortion care. After Iowa blocked Medicaid reimbursements to Planned Parenthood, four PP clinics closed across the state. But the 2016 presidential election also motivated people to get active. Organizations like Planned Parenthood saw a surge in both donations and volunteers. According to a Planned Parenthood spokesperson, more than 200,000 new volunteers have signed up since Nov. 9 nationwide.Nilofar Ganjaie, Lead Field Organizer at Planned Parenthood Votes Northwest and Hawaii, remembers the near instant jump in volunteer numbers post-election. Ganjaie, 24, who first started volunteering with Planned Parenthood when she was 19, credits PP with being there for her when she didn’t have anywhere else to go to for health care. Before Nov. 8, she had about 200 volunteers signed up from the Seattle area, and about 50 who showed up regularly to events and activations. On Nov. 9 alone, she got several hundred volunteer requests. Today, she says that number is “well into the thousands.” “I think that people were really moved to want to take action once there were very real threats to things ― like their access to health care or whether or not their families were going to be able to stay together,” she told HuffPost.These volunteers, old and new, have proven to be integral to Planned Parenthood’s organizing efforts. It’s no accident that Planned Parenthood organizers began lobbying Senators Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) in November. The two senators, along with Sen. John McCain, effectively killed Senate GOP-led Health Care Freedom Act in July, and both have publicly expressed their commitment to funding Planned Parenthood. (When HuffPost sat with the Alaska delegation at the Bellevue organizing summit, they were in the midst of pushing Murkowski to oppose the Graham-Cassidy bill, which died a few days later without ever being voted on.)Nearly a year after the presidential election, the volunteer-led momentum that started up last November hasn’t let up. So Planned Parenthood leaders decided to harness that energy in the hopes of making it more directed, sustainable and intersectional.Thus, the #IStandWithPP Organizing Summits were born. * * * Like Ganjaie, most of the volunteers who came to the Bellevue summit had a story; a personal tie to Planned Parenthood that drove them to commit considerable time and energy to the organization. Pyhala, who is the President of Generation Action at the University of Alaska Anchorage, is one of those volunteers with a story. She grew up in a family that often depended on food stamps in the small city of Soldotna, Alaska. She didn’t always have easy access to health care, and went to a school that didn’t teach comprehensive sex education, which meant that she was never talked to about consent.At 15, she was sexually assaulted during a house party. Pyhala says the months following the assault were some of the most vulnerable of her life.“I was really stripped of my own reproductive justice,” she said. “At the time, I wasn’t comfortable coming out to my parents that it had happened to me because I never even had a sex talk. In my mind, it was like, ‘Oh well, I just had sex.’”Though Pyhala didn’t talk to her parents about the assault, she did live two blocks away from a Planned Parenthood health center. She walked over and received the education and resources she didn’t have at school or at home. ″[I got] all of the information that I needed,” Pyhala told HuffPost. “That includes mental health, that includes reproductive health, that includes education. And they really laid it out to me. This was not a friendly encounter, which I had already had a feeling of, but it really just brought to light that fact. It really was a growing point for me.”A year and a half later, she graduated from high school and moved to Anchorage for college. Once on campus, she became involved with Generation Action almost immediately. Although Generation Action focuses on an array of issues, from LGBTQ inclusion to racial justice to health care access, Pyhala’s deeply personal experience with Planned Parenthood is what convinced her that the health care organization could be a vehicle through which she could fight for a world she wants to see her younger sister live in.Ean Tubbs, 22, is another member of the Generation Action team with a personal connection to Planned Parenthood. He grew up gay and Mormon in Palmer, Alaska ― a place he described as a “very small, conservative town.” “Growing up I just had a negative view of what being gay was,” he told HuffPost, recalling a game he and his classmates played in second grade called “Smear the Queer.”“Everyone would tackle the one who had the ball, who was queer,” said Tubbs, “and that shaped from a very young age what I thought being queer was. Everyone just wanted to tackle you and take you down.”He, like Pyhala, moved out of his hometown after high school and headed to Anchorage for college. It was there that he first went to Planned Parenthood, seeking out the sexual and health education he had never gotten. “Since then, I’ve just been doing all I can for Planned Parenthood,” Tubbs told HuffPost.He even lobbied Sen. Murkowski in person over the summer, in the midst of the battle over Trumpcare. Tubbs was canvassing at a farmer’s market in Anchorage when he spotted Murkowski nearby. He went up to her, wearing his Planned Parenthood T-shirt, and before he could even speak she complimented his shirt.“I was just like, ‘This is going to go well,’” Tubbs remembered. “I kept it pretty quick and asked her, ‘Do you stand with Planned Parenthood?’ And she said, ‘Yes, it’s all about access, and I’m not going to vote on a health care bill that deprives people of that access.’” * * * By late afternoon on Saturday ― after hours of sessions on how to use storytelling to reach people, how to build strong teams, and how to scale local efforts already in existence ― each state represented at the summit got busy mapping out concrete, region-specific goals.For the Anchorage-based Generation Action group, those goals include forging stronger connections with sororities and fraternities on the UAA camps, as well as the Black Student Alliance. The Fairbanks-based group vowed to connect with Alaska-native groups more directly. The entire Alaska delegation discussed how they could motivate people in their state to vote in 2018 by pointing out that the new governor will be able to appoint three out of the five people who will serve on the state’s independent redistricting commission.Each of these goals and questions have national implications and resonance, but each are also unique to the state of Alaska, and the specific community that these Planned Parenthood volunteers live and work in.

But we’re sitting around a crowded table in a ballroom filled with other crowded tables, and every single person there is in the business of battling the patriarchy. This is the northwest regional #IStandWithPP Organizing Summit ― essentially, Planned Parenthood activist bootcamp.“We’re everywhere. We’re in the reddest place, and we’re in the bluest place,” Elaine Rose, CEO of Planned Parenthood Votes Northwest and Hawaii (PPVNH) declared from the center of a stage at the Bellevue Hyatt, that night. “You’re gonna go home and help change the world.”She’s speaking to Pyhala and the other 330+ women, men and gender non-conforming people sitting in a hotel ballroom just outside of Seattle, Wash. on a Friday night. Each person there is one of Planned Parenthood’s top volunteers, and they traveled from around the western part of the United States ― from states like South Dakota, California, Montana and Alaska ― to spend the weekend learning how to “change the world” more effectively. (Similar summits took place in Oklahoma City, Charlotte and Phoenix. When the program is wrapped, about 1,000 volunteers will have gone through the training program.)The goal of these summits, which are the first of their kind for Planned Parenthood, is lofty, but simple: To build out the foundations for 600 effective, intersectional, local action groups ― all in places where a Planned Parenthood health center exists. The hope is that these 600 action groups will be able to activate locally around the issues that impact each community most directly, whether that’s abortion access, or police brutality, or comprehensive sex education, or DACA, or an anti-trans bathroom bill, or all (or none) of the above.Although the organization is most visibly associated with reproductive rights, specifically access to abortion care, Planned Parenthood National Organizing Director Kelley Robinson stressed that the organization sees “any attack on the people that come through a Planned Parenthood health center’s doors [as] a direct attack on our ability to provide care.”“We’ve been around for 100 years through the work of folks really believing in grassroots organizing,” said Robinson. “But now, in this moment, especially as we’re in our second century, it’s been really critical for us to understand that the only way that we’re really going to win is by training our volunteers across the country.” In Bellevue, those volunteers looked like a diverse cross-section of America ― albeit a little younger, a little more tattooed, and wearing a little more pink.* * *It’s been quite a year for Planned Parenthood. The health care organization has long been a target of right-wing legislators, having become one of the most potent symbols of America’s sustained battle over abortion access. With the election of President Donald Trump, alongside a Republican-led House and Senate, Planned Parenthood’s leaders and supporters knew the organization would likely continue to face sustained attacks. And it has. Both the failed American Health Care Act (AHCA) and Graham-Cassidy bill would have “defunded” Planned Parenthood. Trump signed a bill allowing states to withhold federal funding from places that provide abortion care. After Iowa blocked Medicaid reimbursements to Planned Parenthood, four PP clinics closed across the state. But the 2016 presidential election also motivated people to get active. Organizations like Planned Parenthood saw a surge in both donations and volunteers. According to a Planned Parenthood spokesperson, more than 200,000 new volunteers have signed up since Nov. 9 nationwide.Nilofar Ganjaie, Lead Field Organizer at Planned Parenthood Votes Northwest and Hawaii, remembers the near instant jump in volunteer numbers post-election. Ganjaie, 24, who first started volunteering with Planned Parenthood when she was 19, credits PP with being there for her when she didn’t have anywhere else to go to for health care. Before Nov. 8, she had about 200 volunteers signed up from the Seattle area, and about 50 who showed up regularly to events and activations. On Nov. 9 alone, she got several hundred volunteer requests. Today, she says that number is “well into the thousands.” “I think that people were really moved to want to take action once there were very real threats to things ― like their access to health care or whether or not their families were going to be able to stay together,” she told HuffPost.These volunteers, old and new, have proven to be integral to Planned Parenthood’s organizing efforts. It’s no accident that Planned Parenthood organizers began lobbying Senators Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) in November. The two senators, along with Sen. John McCain, effectively killed Senate GOP-led Health Care Freedom Act in July, and both have publicly expressed their commitment to funding Planned Parenthood. (When HuffPost sat with the Alaska delegation at the Bellevue organizing summit, they were in the midst of pushing Murkowski to oppose the Graham-Cassidy bill, which died a few days later without ever being voted on.)Nearly a year after the presidential election, the volunteer-led momentum that started up last November hasn’t let up. So Planned Parenthood leaders decided to harness that energy in the hopes of making it more directed, sustainable and intersectional.Thus, the #IStandWithPP Organizing Summits were born. * * * Like Ganjaie, most of the volunteers who came to the Bellevue summit had a story; a personal tie to Planned Parenthood that drove them to commit considerable time and energy to the organization. Pyhala, who is the President of Generation Action at the University of Alaska Anchorage, is one of those volunteers with a story. She grew up in a family that often depended on food stamps in the small city of Soldotna, Alaska. She didn’t always have easy access to health care, and went to a school that didn’t teach comprehensive sex education, which meant that she was never talked to about consent.At 15, she was sexually assaulted during a house party. Pyhala says the months following the assault were some of the most vulnerable of her life.“I was really stripped of my own reproductive justice,” she said. “At the time, I wasn’t comfortable coming out to my parents that it had happened to me because I never even had a sex talk. In my mind, it was like, ‘Oh well, I just had sex.’”Though Pyhala didn’t talk to her parents about the assault, she did live two blocks away from a Planned Parenthood health center. She walked over and received the education and resources she didn’t have at school or at home. ″[I got] all of the information that I needed,” Pyhala told HuffPost. “That includes mental health, that includes reproductive health, that includes education. And they really laid it out to me. This was not a friendly encounter, which I had already had a feeling of, but it really just brought to light that fact. It really was a growing point for me.”A year and a half later, she graduated from high school and moved to Anchorage for college. Once on campus, she became involved with Generation Action almost immediately. Although Generation Action focuses on an array of issues, from LGBTQ inclusion to racial justice to health care access, Pyhala’s deeply personal experience with Planned Parenthood is what convinced her that the health care organization could be a vehicle through which she could fight for a world she wants to see her younger sister live in.Ean Tubbs, 22, is another member of the Generation Action team with a personal connection to Planned Parenthood. He grew up gay and Mormon in Palmer, Alaska ― a place he described as a “very small, conservative town.” “Growing up I just had a negative view of what being gay was,” he told HuffPost, recalling a game he and his classmates played in second grade called “Smear the Queer.”“Everyone would tackle the one who had the ball, who was queer,” said Tubbs, “and that shaped from a very young age what I thought being queer was. Everyone just wanted to tackle you and take you down.”He, like Pyhala, moved out of his hometown after high school and headed to Anchorage for college. It was there that he first went to Planned Parenthood, seeking out the sexual and health education he had never gotten. “Since then, I’ve just been doing all I can for Planned Parenthood,” Tubbs told HuffPost.He even lobbied Sen.

73,WORLD NEWS,International Red Cross To 'Drastically' Cut Operations In Afghanistan After Deadly Attacks,"By Josh Smith, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/afghanistan-red-cross_us_59db235ce4b072637c450bb2,"At least seven Red Cross workers have been killed in the past year, and another four were abducted.",2017-10-09,Attacks on Red Cross workers has prompted the humanitarian organization to cut back on services in Afghanistan.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59db28012d00009c173094b4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"KABUL (Reuters) - The International Committee of the Red Cross will “drastically” cut back its operations in Afghanistan following attacks that have killed seven of its staff this year, the aid group said on Monday.The announcement underlines the deteriorating security for aid groups in Afghanistan, where the ICRC has been operating for more than 30 years and has been running its fourth biggest humanitarian program.“Exposure to risk has become our greatest challenge and concern,” Monica Zanarelli, head of the ICRC in Afghanistan, told a news conference in the capital, Kabul.“We have no choice but to drastically reduce our presence in Afghanistan,” she said, adding that the decision would particularly affect operations in the north, where facilities in Kunduz, Faryab, and Balkh provinces would be closed or downsized.Red Cross officials said the assessments are ongoing and could not say how many of its 1,800 staff would be affected.The Red Cross had already warned of the threat to its operations following a series of attacks over the past year.In February, the organization put all of its operations on hold after six of its staff were killed in an attack on an aid convoy in the far north.Operations gradually resumed over the summer, but last month, a Spanish Red Cross physiotherapist working in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif was shot dead by one of her patients.In addition, four of its staff have been abducted over the past year.The spreading conflict has combined with an increase in criminality, making for more “blurred lines” between the various armed groups which complicate efforts to safely provide aid, Zanarelli said.“I would say there are more gray areas than there were in the past, and this is certainly what is affecting our capacity to assess our security,” she said.According to U.S. military estimates, the government controls no more than 60 percent of the country, with the rest either controlled or contested by the Taliban and other insurgent groups."
74,POLITICS,South Carolina Democrat Kicks Off Second Congressional Bid With Self-Deprecating Video,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/archie-parnell-south-carolina-congressional-bid_us_59db7e51e4b0f6eed351b89f,Archie Parnell nearly won a June special election in a Republican stronghold.,2017-10-09,"Democrat Archie Parnell campaigns in Bishopville, South Carolina, in June.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59db7ec42000000934085cc4.jpeg?cache=7vK6xuqEU3&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Less than four months after narrowly losing a special election to represent South Carolina’s 5th Congressional District, Democrat Archie Parnell announced that he is going to try his hand again in November 2018.Parnell, a 66-year-old former tax attorney, will formally reveal his plans Monday morning at a cultural center in Sumter that used to be his high school. Local Democratic dignitaries, including House Assistant Minority Leader James Clyburn (D-S.C.), are due to join him.According to an advance copy of his remarks, Parnell plans to emphasize the importance of restoring the “ladder of opportunity” that is now out of reach for many of the district’s residents.“I am running for Congress again because we should be doing better,” the speech says. “Every child born in South Carolina should have the chance to pursue their dreams.”But Parnell is also breaking the news in a minute-long video that offers a tongue-in-cheek account of what he’s been up to since losing his first bid.We see the bookish and bespectacled Parnell sitting in a tattoo parlor with a sleeve of his suit jacket cut off so he can get his arm inked. The ad shows him reading the mock novel “Fifty Shades of the U.S. Tax Code,” going bowling, shopping for groceries, and getting a haircut in a barbershop.In the video, Parnell mentions “all of the madness that’s happening in Washington right now,” and adds that he’s consulted his wife, Sarah, and “held some high-level meetings with some very good friends” ― as the camera cuts to him playing a game of “Go Fish” with Rep. Clyburn.“And today, I’m proud to announce that I’m running for Congress again, to create good jobs, lower your taxes and to make our communities the kind of places we all want them to be,” Parnell concludes, this time back in the tattoo parlor.The tattoo artist then finishes his work and pulls away a bandage to reveal a tattoo that says, “Parnell For Congress 2018.”“Quite lovely, thank you,” Parnell tells him.The video echoes a similarly self-deprecating May campaign ad in which Parnell depicts himself as a tamer version of the “House of Cards” character Frank Underwood. Underwood hails from a fictional district that is clearly based on Parnell’s. Both ads were produced by the Washington-based political consulting firm GMMB.Parnell lost to Republican Ralph Norman by 3.2 percentage points in a June 20 race to fill a seat vacated by former Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.), who is now White House budget director. Norman is a 64-year-old real estate developer and former state lawmaker who ran as a hard-line conservative.The largely rural 5th District, which stretches from Sumter to Rock Hill, has grown reliably Republican since the ultra-conservative Mulvaney was first elected there in 2010. He was re-elected in 2016 by 20 percentage points, and Donald Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton among the district’s voters by 18.5 points.Perhaps as a result, national Democrats largely overlooked Parnell’s long-shot bid in June. It did not help matters that the election occurred the same day as the contest for Georgia’s 6th Congressional District, where Democrat Jon Ossoff’s campaign drew record-breaking donations and wall-to-wall media coverage. Parnell ultimately defied expectations, however, with a campaign focused on pocketbook issues like protecting Social Security, lowering prescription drug costs and reforming the tax code for the benefit of working people. Ossoff, by contrast, lost by 3.6 percentage points ― a larger margin than Parnell, notwithstanding the unprecedented support he received. Of course, while Ossoff raised an unprecedented sum of money for a congressional candidate, he also sustained a comparably large wave of Republican firepower. It is impossible to know how Parnell would have fared if he had endured the volume of attacks that Ossoff experienced. Parnell, who held top posts at Goldman Sachs before retiring in 2016, will once again have the advantage of his considerable personal wealth. Notwithstanding his long history of work in corporate America, Parnell succeeded in rallying many progressive supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) behind his bid. He argued that his experience helping Goldman Sachs and other firms comply with their tax obligations gave him a unique understanding of the best ways to crack down on corporate tax avoidance and make the tax code fairer."

76,IMPACT,This Couple Lost Their Son To Suicide – Now They Help Other Veterans Struggling With PTSD,Alessandra Freitas,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/this-couple-lost-their-son-to-suicide-now-they-work-helping-other-veterans-with-ptsd_us_59d995c3e4b046f5ad98b464,"""Our sons went to war, but we’re here to fight the battle.”",2017-10-09,"From left to right: Dillion, Lisa and Jeff Naslund",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59da3bc22000000934085acd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It wasn’t long after their son’s return from war in Afghanistan, in September of 2011, that Lisa and Jeff Naslund’s joy started to fade into great worry. Dillion Naslund had spent almost a year serving in the 1st Battalion, 133rd Infantry Regiment in the Middle East, and was initially very excited to be back in his hometown of Galva, Iowa.“He was having a blast with friends and family, having fun reconnecting,” Lisa told HuffPost. It was his second time coming home after serving the Army abroad. The 25-year-old had previously fought as an infantry soldier in Iraq four years before ― and the family was excited to welcome Dillion safe and sound again in the farm he grew up in. However, about five months later, things started to change. Dillion was drifting away from his “fun, kind and happy” personality as he was showing signs of short temperedness while isolating himself from others.  “He was struggling, and as a family we thought we just had to give him some time and things would get better,” Lisa said. However, the constant laughter and light one-liner jokes that used to make Dillion “the life of the party” never came back. The now reclusive, brooding man started to often be seen drinking too much and missing work at his construction job. In August 2012, Lisa and Jeff got a scary phone call from their daughter Krystal, who lived a mile away from their home. She and her husband had woken up to a weird noise in the baby monitor and saw a very upset Dillion when they went to check out what was wrong. “Everything is fine, just go back to sleep,” Krystal recalls being told by Dillion. On the counter, she found an alarming note.“He wrote it to thank her and her husband, Craig, for everything they had done and said that he loved them very much, but he was going to end his life,” Lisa said. “We stopped him from leaving the house and tried talking to him to understand what was going on ― and that was the first time he told us about his nightmares and that we could simply not understand what he was going through.”It was only after they took Dillion to the Veterans Affairs health care system in Iowa City that they would hear the term post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, for the first time. “Now we finally had a name for it, so we thought we could fix it,” Lisa said.The veteran was sent home five days later after receiving counseling and medicine, and seemed to be getting better after a while.“But he just got better at hiding it,” Jeff told HuffPost.On Dec. 10, 2012, Lisa received a call from Dillion’s landlord, who reported some financial issues. She went to his apartment, she said, and had a little mother’s tough love argument.“I told him, ‘We’re all here for you, but you have to start helping yourself,’ and he said, ‘You just don’t get it, Mom.’”Later that night, Dillion’s ex-girlfriend contacted the Naslunds about a text she had received from him. “I’m on a gravel road ― I’m going to do something but I’m going to go with a smile on my face,” the text read.“One hour later, the sheriff found Dillion,” Lisa told HuffPost. “He had shot himself in the chest.”Dillion’s story is not the only one of its kind. A VA suicide prevention study published in 2016 found that roughly 20 veterans kill themselves every day ― which accounts for one suicide every 72 minutes. In 2014, veterans represented 18 percent of all deaths from suicide among U.S. adults.The shock from Dillion’s death was heightened after they discovered how many families struggle with the same problem nationwide. They then decided to channel their grief into preventing more veteran suicides. After meeting Howard and Jean Somers, a couple from San Diego who lost their National Guard veteran son to suicide in 2013, they co-founded Operation Engage America. The nonprofit works to connect veterans who have PTSD and their loved ones to various support programs ― the different resources range from mental health care facilities, medical health and wellness, crisis support, caregiver support, transition care, family crisis, financial issues, education, food assistance, service dogs, employment, substance abuse, vet to vet programs, and veteran service organizations.“There are a lot of resources out there and it’s impossible for just one to make a change, but if each do a little, together we do a lot,” Lisa said.They started by hosting resource fairs in Des Moines and San Diego. Now, they count with a staff of five regular volunteers and expanded their work to other states like Nebraska, Maryland and Arizona.The couple met several people just like their son, who always dreamed of serving the military ― and then found themselves living a nightmare while struggling to deal with their postwar traumas.“Growing up, that’s all he would talk about ― he wanted to follow his grandparents’ footsteps, who also served in the war,” Jeff said. “He would get into my makeup and do camouflage painting so he could pretend to be an army man in the farm,” Lisa added.They recall having a National Guard recruiter show up in their home even before Dillion turned 18, in 2005. He was in his junior year at the Galva-Holstein High School and wanted permission from his parents to officially join the army.“Many people ask us ‘why in the world would you sign that?’” but it was his dream and he was about to be 18 anyway,” Lisa said. “He begged us to sign because he wanted our blessing, and I just couldn’t say no after he asked us like that.”The couple learned to get away from the guilt that came with their tragic loss. “For two years I’ve felt like I was the one that had killed our son,” Lisa said. “The reality is I did not ― PTSD is an invisible wound of war and that’s what killed Dillion,” she added.Since they started the program, they have helped hundreds of veterans and their families, along with community members. Many soldiers in crisis seek their help to cope with the burden of what they have seen and done while at duty. Lisa recalls when a veteran from the Midwest called her about a battle buddy who was about to kill himself. She was able to get in touch with him and get him taken to a veteran care facility before he attempted to take his life.“About three weeks later I got a call from the soldier thanking me for helping him ― he said he was determined to end his life that very night, but now he really wanted to live,” she told HuffPost.For Jeff and Lisa, preventing families from going through the pain they experienced is what drives them to continue doing the work. “There are over 64,000 organizations out there to help, and we make sure to connect people with the right ones for them,” she explained. “I wish I had know about many of these programs when Dillion was struggling, so we want others to know what we did not know.”The next resource fair will be held in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on Oct. 14. “Our sons went to war, but we’re here to fight the battle,” Jeff said. “These are our heroes in need, they have sacrificed so much for us all, so this is the least we can do to help them.”If you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. You can also text HELLO to 741-741 for free, 24-hour support from the Crisis Text Line.

A new book claims Ol’ Blue Eyes once sent a blunt message to the future president, telling his manager to tell Trump to “go fuck himself,” per the New York Daily News. Sinatra even offered his phone number in case Trump wanted to hear it directly from him.The episode was detailed in The Way it Was, an upcoming book written by Eliot Weisman, who served as Sinatra’s manager from 1975 until the singer’s death in 1998.Weisman wrote that he had a deal in place for multiple acts to perform at Trump’s Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City when it opened in 1990. The package included both Sinatra and longtime friend, Sammy Davis Jr., who had recently been diagnosed with the cancer that would eventually kill him.Weisman made the deal with Mark Grossinger Etess, the 38-year-old Trump executive in charge of the Taj Mahal. Then, Etess died in a helicopter crash about six months before the Taj Mahal opened. Since the deal was never formalized, Trump decided he wanted to renegotiate, paying less for Sinatra and canceling the other acts. That’s when Sinatra sent his message to Trump, according to the book. The interaction killed the deal and Sinatra performed at rival casino The Sands instead.The account could not be independently corroborated. However, the 1991 book Trumped! ― written by former Trump executive John “Jack” O’Donnell ― confirmed some of the basic details of the story, saying that Etess and Weisman had signed a letter of intent before the helicopter crash. Afterward, Trump complained that Etess spent “way too much of my money.” “Jack, just get me out of this,” Trump told O’Donnell, per the book. “Get me out of this mess.”Although Sinatra’s daughter, singer and frequent Trump critic Nancy Sinatra, hasn’t commented on the matter, she “liked” several tweets that mentioned the report. The Way It Was will be released on Oct. 24. "

The “Birdcage” actor was apparently the emcee for the event, which boasted a star-studded guest list that included Cher, Robert De Niro, Tom Cruise and Weinstein. Lane said Weinstein threw him up against a wall after the actor made a joke about Rudy Giuliani’s comb-over.“This is my f**king show, we don’t need you,” Weinstein reportedly said to the actor.In typical Lane fashion, however, the actor fired back with a quick retort, telling Weinstein, “You can’t hurt me, I don’t have a film career.” Weinstein was fired on Sunday from The Weinstein Company after The New York Times report, which detailed distressing accounts from women, including actress Ashley Judd, who claim they were harassed by Weinstein.Since the report surfaced, other notable names in Hollywood, including Meryl Streep and Rose McGowan, have spoken out against Weinstein.Weinstein didn’t deny the allegations made against him in a statement released Thursday.“I appreciate the way I’ve behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it. Though I’m trying to do better, I know I have a long way to go,” he said. “I so respect all women and regret what happened.” “I cannot be more remorseful about the people I hurt and I plan to do right by all of them,” he added.

81,QUEER VOICES,51 Men Detained In Indonesian 'Gay Spa' Raid,"Agustinus Beo Da Costa, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/indonesia-gay-spa-raid_us_59dba0b4e4b00377980aba8a,Some could face up to six years in prison.,2017-10-09,Activists say police targeting of consensual gay sex has shone a light on discrimination and harassment in the world’s third-largest democracy.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59dbb4d2140000a623493d4d.jpeg?cache=407n4v3hGO&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian police detained 51 men including several foreigners in a raid on what authorities described as a “gay spa” in Jakarta late on Friday, and some could face up to six years in prison under pornography and prostitution laws.The arrests are the latest in a spate of high-profile police actions against gay clubs and parties in Indonesia this year that have called the country’s reputation for tolerance into question.With the exception of the ultra-conservative Aceh province in northern Sumatra, where Islamic law is enforced and two men were publicly flogged last month for gay sex, homosexuality is legal in Indonesia, home to the world’s largest Muslim population.Among those detained at the spa in Central Jakarta on Friday were four Chinese nationals, a Singaporean, one Thai national, one Malaysian, and one Dutchman, although none of the foreigners would be charged, Jakarta Police spokesman Argo Yuwono told Reuters on Saturday.When asked about what the people in the spa were doing at the time of the raid, Yuwono noted that it was dark at the time.“LGBT is clearly between men and men or same-sex relationships. Male prostitution,” Yuwono said, without clarifying further. He said those charged could face up to six years in prison under Indonesia’s pornography law.“There’s a cashier, the manager there and also those providing facilities like towels and other things,” he said.Activists say police targeting of consensual gay sex has shone a light on discrimination and harassment in the world’s third-largest democracy.Andreas Harsono, a Jakarta-based researcher for Human Rights Watch, referred to a pattern of discriminatory police action against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people in Indonesia.“If they raided (this club) because they are gay, it is abusive, it is abuse of power,” he said, adding that there is no law against homosexuality as long as relationships are consensual.“If there is no victim, there is no crime,” he said.Police often used to the pornography law to “criminalize” such cases, but that law itself is also problematic, Harsono said, noting that people could be charged if they had pornographic material on a cell phone.“Just imagine if every person in Indonesia had their cell phones checked, how many hundred million people would go to jail?”In May, officers detained 141 men in a raid on the Atlantis sauna, accusing them of involvement in a gay prostitution ring in a part of Jakarta that is also home to many heterosexual “spas.”(This version corrects month of floggings in Aceh province to May from last month in paragraph 3)"
