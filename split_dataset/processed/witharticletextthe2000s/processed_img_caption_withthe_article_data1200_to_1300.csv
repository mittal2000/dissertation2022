",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58da547c1d0000f42c7d0dfe.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Most of the public isn’t shedding many tears over AHCA. President Trump’s approval ratings may be headed even further underwater. And more Americans than ever are worrying about climate change. This is HuffPollster for Tuesday, March 28, 2017.FEW ARE MOURNING THE DEMISE OF THE GOP’S HEALTH BILL - HuffPollster: “After Republicans’ attempt to repeal Obamacare failed, a narrow plurality of Americans wants to see the party move on to other issues, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov survey. The American Health Care Act, which was deeply unpopular during its brief lifespan, is no more popular in its demise. Just 21 percent say they supported it, with a majority, 52 percent, saying they were opposed. The 6 percent who say they strongly favored the bill are outnumbered nearly 6 to 1 by those who strongly opposed it. Americans say by a 7-percentage-point margin, 44 percent to 37 percent, that Republicans should move on to other issues rather than proposing another health care bill...Trump voters were only lukewarmly positive about AHCA ― 45 percent say that they supported it and 31 percent that they opposed it. But they generally don’t see its failure as a death knell for Republicans’ prospects of fulfilling their promise to repeal Obamacare.” [HuffPost] Who gets the blame? - More from the survey: “Asked who’s most responsible for the bill’s failure, 27 percent of Americans put the bulk of the blame on its authors, with 17 percent naming the congressional Republicans who opposed the bill, another 17 percent naming Trump and 14 percent citing congressional Democrats. Just 4 percent of Trump voters, however, believe that Trump is most responsible for the bill’s failure, and only 11 percent assign him even partial responsibility. Instead, they cast the blame nearly everywhere else.”TRUMP’S ALREADY LOW RATINGS MAY BE GETTING EVEN LOWER - HuffPollster: “In a Gallup survey released Monday, just 36 percent of Americans said they approved of Trump’s job as president. It was a new low for him, and 2 percentage points below former President Barack Obama’s all-time worst numbers, according to Gallup’s polling. That specific number, like any individual data point, doesn’t actually mean all that much. Gallup’s tracking poll is somewhat volatile, as is the public reaction to its findings. When Trump’s approval hit a previous low of 37 percent earlier this month, it kicked off a wave of social media freakouts. Then, it promptly rebounded by several points....But even in the aggregate, Trump’s current approval rating doesn’t look too good. HuffPost Pollster’s average, which combines publicly available polling, puts Trump’s approval rating somewhat higher: It’s about 40 percent as of Monday afternoon, with just under 56 percent disapproving….The aggregate also suggests that Trump’s numbers, on average, are worsening after a period of relative stability. Individual trend lines tell a similar story. Most pollsters who’ve conducted at least two surveys this month, and at least one with field dates as recent as last week, show the president’s net approval declining during the course of March.” [HuffPost]Some historical context from Gallup - Frank Newport: “Trump’s current 36% is two percentage points below Barack Obama’s low point of 38%, recorded in 2011 and 2014. Trump has also edged below Bill Clinton’s all-time low of 37%, recorded in the summer of 1993, his first year in office, as well as Gerald Ford’s 37% low point in January and March 1975. John F. Kennedy’s lowest approval rating was 56%; Dwight Eisenhower’s was 48%....Presidential job approval ratings are fluid, and all presidents have seen both upward and downward swings in their ratings at various points in their administrations ― a historical precedent indicating Trump’s approval could drop further or recover in the weeks and months ahead. An encouraging sign for Trump, perhaps, is that all presidents whose ratings fell below 36% ― with the exception of Nixon ― saw their ratings improve thereafter.” [Gallup]A RECORD SHARE OF AMERICANS ARE ‘CONCERNED BELIEVERS’ ON GLOBAL WARMING - Lydia Saad: “With a record number of Americans sounding the alarm on global warming, the share of the U.S. population that Gallup categorizes as ‘Concerned Believers’ on climate change has consequently reached a new high of 50%. This is up slightly from 47% in 2016 but is well above the 37% recorded only two years ago….Concerned Believers worry a great deal about global warming and think human activity causes global warming. Two-thirds in this group also expect global warming to pose a serious threat in their lifetime, while none believe that news reports exaggerate the problem….There has long been a disconnect between the high proportions of Americans who believe global warming is real and even ascribe it to human activity, and the low priority Americans give to global warming as a policy issue and a factor in their vote. This is largely explained by the relatively low percentages of Americans who consider global warming a serious threat in their lifetimes or who say they worry a great deal about it. That may be changing, however.” [Gallup]SUPPORT FOR SOME LIBERAL POSITIONS MAY BE SOLIDIFYING - Aaron Blake: “For the first time ever, half of Americans say they believe in climate change and that they are very concerned about it, according to Gallup. Thanks, President Trump. Climate change is merely the latest issue on which the American people have moved appreciably and significantly to the left in the Trump era. While it’s difficult to ascribe any one of these shifts to Trump specifically, the pattern is becoming clearer. And there’s growing evidence that Trump is unifying half (or more) of the country against things he has vocally supported — in ways they simply weren’t unified before….A more long-running example of this is Trump’s U.S.-Mexico border wall. While it had been a somewhat popular proposal for years, Americans have now turned against it pretty strongly….A big reason for the decline, UC-Irvine professor Michael Tesler noted, was that Trump opponents rallied to the view he opposed.” [WashPost]DID POOR DEMOCRATIC TURNOUT REALLY SINK HILLARY CLINTON? - Nate Cohn: “In the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election, many analysts suggested that Hillary Clinton lost to Donald J. Trump because of poor Democratic turnout. Months later, it is clear that the turnout was only modestly better for Mr. Trump than expected. To the extent Democratic turnout was weak, it was mainly among black voters. Even there, the scale of Democratic weakness has been exaggerated. Instead, it’s clear that large numbers of white, working-class voters shifted from the Democrats to Mr. Trump. Over all, almost one in four of President Obama’s 2012 white working-class supporters defected from the Democrats in 2016, either supporting Mr. Trump or voting for a third-party candidate. This analysis compares official voter files — data not available until months after the election — with The Upshot’s pre-election turnout projections in Florida, Pennsylvania and North Carolina….These estimates suggest that turnout improved Mr. Trump’s standing by a modest margin compared with pre-election expectations. If the turnout had gone exactly as we thought it would, the election would have been extremely close. But by this measure, Mrs. Clinton still would have lost both Florida and Pennsylvania — albeit very narrowly….It’s important to note that this is just one analysis, based on one set of data.” [NYT]HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!

1,POLITICS,Democrats Are Back On Offense And Waiting For GOP To Beg For Their Help,Jennifer Bendery and Ryan Grim,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-obamacare-repeal_us_58dab0f7e4b054637062943a,"""Republicans have never once since they took authority back ... passed a fiscally necessary bill by themselves.""",2017-03-28,The GOP's years-long push to repeal Obamacare just failed. Democrats may have just gotten some leverage back.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58dab3771d0000f42c7d0fca.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― With Republicans in retreat from their aborted effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Democrats are now in hot pursuit, demanding that the administration cease any effort to “explode” the health care law.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), meanwhile, is proposing her own tweaks to the ACA and calling on her colleagues to put forward their ideas.“We can then discuss these suggestions in our Caucus and be prepared at the earliest possible time to go forward,” she wrote in a Tuesday letter to her caucus. “It would be my hope to create a list of priorities to engage with our colleagues, with social media and advocacy groups, and perhaps even with the President.”The most aggressive proposal so far has come from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee. They’re calling for party members to embrace a Medicare For All program.Pelosi floated some of her ideas for bipartisan fixes during a roundtable with reporters: extending subsidies for people who have higher incomes but don’t qualify for tax credits; restoring risk corridors; enabling the health and human services secretary to negotiate lower prescription drug prices; fixing the individual market; and extending reinsurance.Asked how Democrats can work with Republicans on the health care law when House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) insisted Tuesday that the GOP will still repeal and replace it, Pelosi pointed to a portrait of Abraham Lincoln on the wall and said he was right that public sentiment is everything.“This fight has done something transformational,” she said. “People who might not have been for the Affordable Care Act until they enjoyed it for three years now are like, ‘What, you’re taking that away from me?’ Promising something with the thought of the Affordable Care Act, that didn’t get anybody’s attention. But taking it away does.” President Donald Trump, ready to wipe his hands clean of the health care defeat, said he is shifting his focus to tax reform and infrastructure. But before he gets to those, he’ll need to deal with the expiration of funding for the federal government, which comes on April 28, and the debt limit, which also looms. Getting either of those things done without Democratic support will be a difficult charge for the president, if health care is any indication.House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) on Tuesday noted that Republicans routinely rely on help from Democrats to pass spending bills due to conservatives defecting.“The Republicans have never once since they took authority back, the majority back, since 2010, have passed a fiscally necessary bill by themselves,” he said. “They’ve always needed the help of Democrats.”No such help would be forthcoming unless Trump and Ryan stop undermining the ACA by “talking it down” and by taking administrative steps to maim it, Hoyer warned.“If there are evident steps to undermine the Affordable Care Act, that will undermine good faith,” the Maryland Democrat said. “People, correctly, are very disturbed and upset about the fact that their health care is at risk and that the administration, in effect, says it’s going to explode, implode, fail.”He said Democrats will continue to be “aggressive” about protecting the health care law. But they’re also eager to work with the president to find ways to improve it.Trump has proposed some surprising reforms in the past. During the debate over repeal, Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) used his time in a Budget Committee hearing to point out that if Trump wanted to follow through on his campaign promise to repeal Obamacare and replace it with something “terrific,” he could fall back on an idea he once endorsed: single payer.“Donald Trump supported a single-payer system modeled after Canada in 2000, in his book, We Deserve,” Khanna told The Huffington Post. “He knows that is the only system that would fulfill his promise of more benefits, more coverage and less costs. We should have every Democrat quoting Trump on a single-payer system as a mantra and support Senator Sanders and Congressman Welch in their vision for Medicare For All, or at least a public option.”“To resist Trump,” he added, “we need to play offense and not just defense.”"

During the conference, Bonnstetter asked Frank Martin, South Carolina’s coach, whether he valued technique or attitude more in his players when he teaches defense. Martin was clearly impressed.“First of all, a lot of respect to you,” Martin said. “That’s a heck of a question. I’ve been doing this a long time and that’s the first time anyone has ever asked me that. That’s a heck of a question. Attitude comes first.”Footage of the exchange between Max and the coach has been retweeted thousands of times. Aside from a few reporters complaining about a kid attending the conference, Max has received a lot of positive feedback online.According to VICE Sports, Max turned 13 earlier this month and began writing for Sports Illustrated Kids last year. His Twitter account, which currently has more than 1,900 followers, shows that he has interviewed several athletes and offered commentary on many sporting events.There’s no doubt we’ll be seeing more of this kid’s byline."

About half of those people rely on private wells for their drinking water.Now it looks like the cows are polluting the water.A 2015 analysis funded by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources found that more than one-third of the private drinking wells tested had levels of nitrates and coliform that exceeded health standards. Both of those contaminants are found in cow manure.Environmentalists argue that the county’s wealth of dairy farms are largely to blame for its water woes. The state’s powerful dairy lobby has rejected that claim, pointing to septic tanks leaking human waste as another factor. Regardless, Kewaunee County residents are eager for a solution to a problem that has been many years in the making. The fact that they’re still waiting may serve as a warning about what’s to come if an already underfunded Environmental Protection Agency gets hit with budget cuts from a hostile president.In 2011, farmer Lynn Utesch launched an advocacy group called Kewaunee CARES aimed at addressing water pollution. When its efforts failed to garner much of a response from local or state officials, the group partnered with a coalition of state and national environmental groups in 2014 to petition the EPA to intervene. In the two-and-a-half years since, Utesch said little has changed. While the EPA helped form a Groundwater Collaboration Workgroup and pledged further monitoring, the local water remains undrinkable, according to Utesch. He ran for the state assembly last fall in an attempt to elevate the county’s water concerns, but lost to the incumbent. “The citizens of Kewaunee County have not seen any real action,” Utesch said. “The EPA has not actually come into our county to help out. No state agency has provided clean drinking water. Our government is not looking out for our people here.”The EPA participates in a Department of Natural Resources committee considering changes to Wisconsin’s manure spreading requirements and continues to review the situation, the agency told HuffPost. It is also coordinating with the state Department of Natural Resources to implement the working group’s recommendations, which include revamped enforcement procedures for non-compliant dairy farms.But Utesch has little faith in future EPA action in Kewaunee, particularly given the drastic cuts the Trump administration has proposed for the agency.“The way it looks right now, we might be waiting indefinitely for something to take place,” he said. “We may never see a response and that’s very disheartening to our population here. How long do we have to wait until we can have clean water for all our citizens?” Utesch appears to have even less confidence in the state Department of Natural Resources, which did not respond to a request for comment. “I have no faith in the state of Wisconsin to do what’s right, unfortunately,” he said. “It will take someone with the courage to stand up and say we need to fix this. I don’t see anyone at the state or federal level who can do that.”There’s good reason for that lack of faith, environmental groups say. “Fast and furious” changes to the way Wisconsin approaches environmental issues began shortly after Republican Gov. Scott Walker took office in January 2011, according to Kerry Schumann, executive director at the state League of Conservation Voters. Almost immediately, Walker and the Republican-dominated state legislature pushed to roll back protections, including a rule aimed at limiting phosphorous runoff in state waterways, which Republicans called too costly for businesses. Under Walker’s leadership, Wisconsin has slashed Department of Natural Resources funding, eliminating scientist and environmental educator positions. There has also been a push to silence discussions of climate change at the agency, and all climate change language was quietly scrubbed from its website late last year. “At the DNR, there is a culture shift in how the work is done,” Schumann told HuffPost. “There’s been a huge exodus of experts and a change in the enforcement of laws. Even if we had the best laws in the world, it wouldn’t matter because they’re not being enforced.”Schumann’s last comment refers to a state audit released last year that found the Department of Natural Resources was mostly ignoring its water pollution rules, issuing notices against polluters in only 33 of 558 cases reported over the last decade. The state Department of Justice has also drastically shrunk its environmental protection unit at a time when fines against polluters were already at a nearly unprecedented low. Meanwhile, the number of Wisconsin waterways that made the EPA’s “impaired” list doubled between 2004 and 2016. It’s no wonder that environmentalists in Wisconsin are anxious about what might happen if their federal backstop loses funding.“Water issues are near a crisis level in Wisconsin,” said Amber Meyer Smith, director of programs and government relations at Clean Wisconsin. “It’s been a tough few years for the environment in Wisconsin, that’s for sure.” Looking at the federal picture, Meyer Smith described the proposal to zero out funding for the EPA’s Great Lakes restoration initiative — a cut that Walker has said he opposes and will fight — as “stunning.” But groups like hers will keep fighting for the environment, regardless of what comes from the Wisconsin capitol or the White House. And she is ready to take that battle to the courts, if need be.“At the end of the day, we still have the Clean Water Act to be upheld and the Clean Air Act to be upheld,” Meyer Smith said. “Either that happens at the EPA or there’s going to be a lot of lawsuits.”―-Joseph Erbentraut covers promising innovations and challenges in the areas of food, water, agriculture and climate.

The aforementioned remarks and a number of tweets ― which included callous reactions to the 2014 killing of Michael Brown ― moved best friends Webster-Cazeau and Noel to action. And like anyone on a quest for justice, the two kept receipts of their peers’ wrongdoings. They printed out around 25 tweets that evidenced the toxic racism of their peers and showed them to their headmaster in the fall of 2014. After a year and a half of inaction by the administration, Webster-Cazeau and Noel launched #BlackatBLS in January 2016. To kick off the campaign, the two made a video ― which now has over 30,000 views ― that encouraged others to join them in bringing attention to the school’s racism and pushing the BLS administration to create a better environment for black students. The video led to the trending #BlackatBLS hashtag, which other students used to share their experiences with racism at the school. One BLS student’s headline-making interaction with a teacher just two months after the campaign took off further illustrated the reality of being a black student at the school. This incident and a May video update from BLS BLACK indicated that no social progress was made in the school.But the campaign did lead to an investigation of the school by Boston Public Schools, as well as a citywide discussion on race that culminated in the resignation of the school’s headmaster, Lynne Mooney Teta, in June. Just last week, the school appointed a new headmaster ― who happens to be a black woman and BLS’s first headmaster of color.The two have received recognition throughout the year for #BlackatBLS, including being chosen as the 2016 Bostonians of the Year by The Boston Globe and being awarded an honorable mention from The Harvard College Women’s Center. “It kind of felt surreal,” Webster-Cazeau said of hearing about the Boston Globe award. “It was this thing that blew up and everyone kept texting and calling and congratulating me, but it never really felt real.”Webster-Cazeau told The Huffington Post on Tuesday that while she keeps in contact with students who may be experiencing the same things she and Noel have and gives them advice, she isn’t as actively involved with #BlackatBLS. “I’ve somewhat stepped back from the movement and let the students who are still at BLS take over, because they’re there every day living with the changes,” Webster-Cazeau said. Webster-Cazeau told The Temple News that the university’s diversity has been uplifting. Noel now attends Spelman College, a historically black women’s liberal arts institution. The two continue to be besties and stay up-to-date on matters of racial justice. "

The video led to the trending #BlackatBLS hashtag, which other students used to share their experiences with racism at the school. One BLS student’s headline-making interaction with a teacher just two months after the campaign took off further illustrated the reality of being a black student at the school. This incident and a May video update from BLS BLACK indicated that no social progress was made in the school.But the campaign did lead to an investigation of the school by Boston Public Schools, as well as a citywide discussion on race that culminated in the resignation of the school’s headmaster, Lynne Mooney Teta, in June. Just last week, the school appointed a new headmaster ― who happens to be a black woman and BLS’s first headmaster of color.The two have received recognition throughout the year for #BlackatBLS, including being chosen as the 2016 Bostonians of the Year by The Boston Globe and being awarded an honorable mention from The Harvard College Women’s Center. “It kind of felt surreal,” Webster-Cazeau said of hearing about the Boston Globe award. “It was this thing that blew up and everyone kept texting and calling and congratulating me, but it never really felt real.”Webster-Cazeau told The Huffington Post on Tuesday that while she keeps in contact with students who may be experiencing the same things she and Noel have and gives them advice, she isn’t as actively involved with #BlackatBLS. “I’ve somewhat stepped back from the movement and let the students who are still at BLS take over, because they’re there every day living with the changes,” Webster-Cazeau said. Webster-Cazeau told The Temple News that the university’s diversity has been uplifting. Noel now attends Spelman College, a historically black women’s liberal arts institution. The two continue to be besties and stay up-to-date on matters of racial justice. "
7,MEDIA,Trump Really Wants To Deflect Attention From His Russia Scandal,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-fox-news-podesta_us_58dac814e4b0cb23e65c1898,The president hyped a Fox News segment featuring a guest tied to White House chief strategist Steve Bannon and top campaign backers.,2017-03-28,President Trump urged Twitter follows to tune into Fox News segment. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58daccef1400002000072086.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump urged his 27 million Twitter followers on Tuesday morning to immediately tune into Fox News. “Watch @foxandfriends now on Podesta and Russia!” the president tweeted at 7:16 a.m. A minute later, “Fox & Friends” co-host Steve Doocy introduced Peter Schweizer, president of the Government Accountability Institute and author of the book Clinton Cash. Schweizer discussed how former Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta had served on the board of Massachusetts-based energy company Joule Unlimited, which several years ago received a $35 million investment from Kremlin-backed fund Rusnano. It was Schweizer’s organization that reported in July 2016 on Podesta’s past ties to Joule, though the business arrangement was framed as a major revelation in the four-minute “Fox & Friends” segment, complete with on-screen graphics like “Kremlin Connection,” “Putin To Podesta,” and “Hidden Assets.” And the report questioned whether Podesta broke the law in failing to disclose owning stock in the company when joining the Obama White House in early 2014.But the Fox News piece didn’t share with viewers Schweizer’s long-running ties to Trump’s chief strategist, Steve Bannon, and two top donors, Robert and Rebekah Mercer.In 2012, Schweizer and Bannon co-founded the Government Accountability Institute, and the Mercer family donated millions of dollars to it. Rebekah Mercer is now chairwoman of the self-described nonpartisan investigative organization.The Fox News segment also failed to mention that Schweizer is now senior editor at-large at Breitbart News, the right-wing, nationalist site previously led by Bannon and part-owned by the Mercer family. Bannon and Schweizer co-wrote a Breitbart piece in August on the Podesta’s ties to Joule. In addition, Bannon and Rebekah Mercer co-produced the 2016 film version of Schweizer’s Clinton Cash book. Such disclosures, however, may have detracted from the report on “Fox & Friends,” a staple of Trump’s media diet. And Trump may have hyped the segment as a way to deflect attention from ongoing investigations into suspected links between several of the president’s associates and the Russian government. The U.S. intelligence community concluded earlier this year that Russia tried to interfere in the 2016 election by hacking the Democratic National Committee and swiping emails from Podesta’s inbox. National security adviser Michael Flynn resigned last month after it was revealed he misled Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. On Monday, Trump’s top adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, agreed to testify before Senate investigators.But unlike the emerging details about key figures in Trump’s campaign and administration, the story the president sought to push on Podesta’s so-called “Kremlin connection” is one he and others have tried to spread since the 2016 election.Schweizer and Bannon co-wrote a Breitbart News story on Aug. 1 off the Government Accountability Institute report, headlined: “Report: Hillary Clinton’s Campaign Mgr John Podesta Sat on Board of Company that Bagged $35 Million from Putin-Connected Russian Govt Fund.” Bannon, then executive chairman of Breitbart News, joined the Trump campaign a couple weeks later as chief executive. The Trump campaign also highlighted Podesta’s role on Joule’s board. In October, Trump tweeted a campaign press release on “Clinton’s close ties to Putin,” which cited the Breitbart piece written by Schweizer and Bannon. That month, the national media began extensively covering Podesta’s stolen emails as WikiLeaks dripped them out daily. The Washington bureau for the McClatchy newspaper chain reported how emails related to Joule in the WikiLeaks cache shed light on Podesta’s “indirect ties to Russia.” McClatchy also reported that Podesta moved his Joule shares into a holding company before joining the Obama administration.As the Russia story continues to ensnare the Trump administration, Breitbart News revisited its August story this month to suggest a double standard in the media, which it claimed has ignored “Clinton-Russia Bombshells.”Last week, The Daily Caller, a conservative outlet co-founded by current Fox News prime-time host Tucker Carlson, published an “exclusive” report headlined: “Podesta was board member of firms linked to Russian investors.” The site next reported Sunday that Podesta “may have violated federal law” by failing to disclose shares of stock when joining the Obama administration.Despite the renewed attention in the conservative media on the Joule connection, The Huffington Post’s Jason Linkins wrote Tuesday that Podesta appears not to have violated any law because he wasn’t legally obligated to fill out the part of the disclosure form that The Daily Caller seized upon. “Basically, what’s ‘exclusive’ in this story is wrong, and what’s wrong with Podesta’s life in the revolving door was reported months ago in much better detail,” Linkins wrote, referring to McClatchy’s October article.Nevertheless, Trump seems intent to drive attention to the “Podesta Russian Company,” as he described it in a Monday night tweet, while asserting that the “Trump Russia story is a hoax.” “Fox & Friends” cited Trump’s tweet at the start of Tuesday’s show, and suggested ― like Trump’s campaign and Breitbart News ― that the news media isn’t giving sufficient coverage to links between members of Clinton’s circle and Russia. Trump tweeted his recommendation to tune in just as Schweizer was to appear on air. Tuesday afternoon, Trump returned to Twitter to again hype Fox News and the Podesta story.Trump also urged his Twitter followers on Saturday to watch “Justice,” a prime-time Fox News program hosted by Jeanine Pirro. Pirro began her show by calling for House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) to resign from his position following the failure to pass a Republican health care bill.Pirro echoed leading influential pro-Trump voices in the media who blame Ryan for the legislative mess, while lauding the president for handling the legislative setback “with dignity.” Since becoming president, Trump has given most of his sit-down TV interviews with Fox News, the right-leaning network to which he also retreated during the final months of the 2016 campaign. The president has praised Fox News as “fair,” while regularly bashing competitors as “fake news.” And such warm feelings apparently run in the family.On Tuesday morning, Eric Trump heaped praise upon Trump’s biggest prime-time booster during a “Fox & Friends” interview that preceded the Podesta segment. “There is no better patriot in the world than Sean Hannity,” the younger Trump said. “He’s just a great, great man.”"

10,GREEN,Drones Are Bugging Seals Pupping On A California Sanctuary Beach,Mary Papenfuss,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/harbor-seal-pupping-drones_us_58d9b1b6e4b00f68a5ca31e9,Operators are being warned to stop before frightened mothers abandon their young.,2017-03-28,Mother and pup harbor seals in California. Close to 100 harbor seals typically gather annually to give birth at Hopkins Beach in Pacific Grove.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d9d2af1400008806071dc6.jpeg?ops=crop_128_399_3459_2219%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Hobby drone operators upsetting seals giving birth in a California marine sanctuary are threatening the survival of the pups, animal experts say. Officials are cracking down on the buzzing machines at the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary on California’s Central Coast. Close to 100 harbor seals typically gather annually to give birth at Hopkins Beach in Pacific Grove in the sanctuary. Mothers stay as long as June nursing their young. The Hopkins Beach rookery is currently fenced off to protect the pregnant and nursing seals and pups, but people have been getting around the fences and drones fly over them, reported KSBW-TV in Monterey.The Marine Mammal Center in Marin County, which rescues starving and abandoned seal pups, has received several complaints about drones bothering the seals. Not only do the drones upset the seals’ sleep cycles, they can also frighten a mother so seriously that she may abandon her pup. “A buzzing drone is a completely foreign sound for seals resting on the beach,” Laura Chapman, the center’s northern range operations manager, said in a statement to The Huffington Post. “This unexpected sound can startle a harbor seal mother, causing her to abandon her pup during this critical nursing time.”Two pups were recently born in the rocks of Hopkins Beach, which is rare. Harbor seals usually give birth on the sand of a beach. Both pups were abandoned after witnesses reported that drones had been flying over them, according to the local TV station. One of the pups has been rescued by the Marine Mammal Center.It’s illegal to operate any drones over the area because it’s within a drone “no-fly” zone around the Monterey airport. The federal Marine Mammal Protection Act also prohibits harassing seals and requires people on any beach to stay at least 150 feet from a seal or sea lion.Volunteer docents at the marine sanctuary have been ordered to track down drone operators to tell them to stop. “About half the time they’re very cooperative,” docent Thom Akeman told KQED in San Francisco. “Other times they’re very belligerent because they think they have a right to fly anywhere.” It’s not clear if the drones are filming the seals or if operators are simply using the open area to play with their drones, Akeman said. He doesn’t ask them — just tells them to stop, he said.Harbor seals, sea lions and elephant seals along the Pacific Coast have enough to deal with because of climate change and dwindling and moving fish populations. The Marine Mammal Center has dealt with record numbers of pup strandings the last few years as mothers are away longer to search for fish. The hungry pups sometimes strike out on their own, often with little chance of survival.The center cautions anyone who sees an abandoned pup not to touch the animal but to call a rescue center. "
11,WOMEN,Stop Talking About Abortion Access Without Considering Women Who Get Them,Emma Gray,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stop-talking-about-abortion-access-without-considering-women-who-get-them_us_58d92a1fe4b02a2eaab6113a,"What a NYTimes op-ed suggesting Democrats shouldn't be the ""abortion party"" missed.",2017-03-28,"A woman holds a sign at the Women's March on Washington on Jan. 21, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58840f331c00002e00d9377c.jpeg?cache=vFlcOIFi10&ops=crop_7_398_1590_1049%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"In a 900-word op-ed focused on abortion and the way politicians speak about abortion, the words “woman” and “women” each appear just once.Surprising, right? You might think that it would be difficult to engage in an extended discussion about abortion without acknowledging the people who have abortions. But lo and behold, author, professor and former priest Thomas Groome managed to do just that in an op-ed for the New York Times. Groome argues that “Democrats must stop being the abortion party” if they want to appeal to Catholic voters and win elections. But in doing so, he essentially ignores the very women that vote for Democrats ― in part because they need access to reproductive care, and want to see their elected officials recognize and fight for that right. The op-ed treats abortion as a political talking point that should be pushed to the side and spoken about in hazy, moral terms in order to avoid alienating people who would prefer that abortions didn’t exist. And yet it’s women, especially low-income women and women of color, who make up a significant portion of the base of the Democratic party and suffer the consequences when anti-abortion policies (which Republicans tend to champion) are implemented. One need look no further than the respective major party platforms to see what a stark contrast there is between Democrats and Republicans when it comes to reproductive rights. The 2016 Democratic platform states that Democrats “believe unequivocally, like the majority of Americans, that every woman should have access to quality reproductive health care services, including safe and legal abortion ― regardless of where she lives, how much money she makes, or how she is insured.” It also commits to repealing the Hyde Amendment, which restricts federal Medicaid coverage for abortion services, disproportionately impacting low-income women. On the other hand, the 2016 GOP platform proclaims support for 20-week abortion bans, and declares that Republicans “will not fund or subsidize healthcare that includes abortion coverage.”Groome is right that a strong commitment to protecting American women’s legal right to access abortion care may alienate some voters ― even those who at one time voted for Democratic candidates. But the point of winning elections isn’t simply to win them.Ostensibly, winning an election is about getting to enact a specific vision of governance ― hopefully one that its champions truly believe will make life better for the people they are governing. And as research has shown, for women, access to safe abortion care literally means better life outcomes. Curtailing that access has the opposite effect. Abortion access is both an economic and health imperative for many women, something that Groome’s column completely sidesteps. After a loss like the one that Democrats experienced during the 2016 presidential election, it makes sense to expect Democratic leaders to examine their tactics and rethink their messaging. And Groome’s point that Democrats should actively highlight the way that progressive policies (i.e. access to sex ed and contraception) actually lead to a decrease in unplanned pregnancies, and therefore abortions, is a good one. But to insist that Democrats backtrack their support of safe abortion access because a specific religious group feels uncomfortable with the stance assumes that religious beliefs should hold the same weight as a person’s right to make decisions about their own medical care.Would we expect the Democratic party to make a similar concession to appease voters who oppose marriage equality or the rights of transgender children on religious grounds? I certainly hope not. Treating issues that fundamentally impact people’s lives as pieces in a game of political chess is a far more morally tenuous position than insisting that Roe v. Wade is the law of the land.As a person who will never need to access an abortion, perhaps Groome is not the best person to speak on the issue. And yet across the board in 2017, as a recent report from the Women’s Media Center shows, men still dominate the coverage of reproductive rights, both as reporters and as expert sources.When it comes to reproductive issues, the voices that should be heard most loudly are those of women and gender non-conforming people who needed or might need access to abortion care in the future. Those are the people who political leaders should listen to when crafting their positions, messaging and policy proposals.If the only way for Democrats to win elections is to turn their backs on the needs and lived experiences of the Americans who vote for them, then there’s a lot more the party needs to rethink than its stance on abortion.

On March 22, her 8-year-old cousin, Allysson Baires, asked if she could jog with her.“I thought she might of been bored and just wanted to go out,” Briseyda told the Huffington Post.The two cousins were jogging along when all of a sudden Allysson stopped, busted out a Rice Krispie Treat and began to eat it.“She always does something random and silly,” Briseyda told HuffPost. “I didn’t really question it.”She did, however, find the whole situation pretty funny and cute, so she snapped a picture.After Allysson had replenished her energy with a delicious snack (relatable), Briseyda figured her young cousin wasn’t that into the idea of jogging and the two decided to walk and talk instead.During their walk, Allysson told Briseyda her real motive behind wanting to exercise: Kds at her school, including her crush named Hector, had called her fat. Briseyda then explained to Allysson that exercise should be done in order to be healthy ― not because of others’ opinions of you.“I told her that beauty isn’t physical,” Briseyda told HuffPost. “And that as long as she is healthy and happy no one’s opinion should matter.”The talk worked. Allysson soon laughed the whole thing off.“She brushed it off quickly and honestly doesn’t care anymore,” Briseyda said. “She’s very smart and over the situation.”Later that day, Briseyda posted photos from the jog, explaining the bittersweet situation:The post went viral, receiving over 43,000 likes and 12,000 retweets, with many condemning Hector’s comments about Allysson’s body. As for other kids who find themselves in a situation similar to Allysson’s, Briseyda has a little advice: “You should never let anyone’s opinion change how you see yourself.”Those are some solid words to chew over."

The decision effectively gives the prisoner, Bobby James Moore, the opportunity to be re-sentenced, most likely to life in prison.The justices have been raising the bar on the sentencing of people with mental disabilities over the last several years. In a landmark 2002 ruling, the court said the Constitution prohibits states from imposing the death penalty on the intellectually disabled. In 2014, the justices explained that courts determining intellectual disability can’t just rely on rigid metrics and must look to the judgment of medical experts.Tuesday’s 5-to-3 decision said the factors that the Texas state court considered in weighing Moore’s level of impairment create “an unacceptable risk that persons with intellectual disability will be executed.”Among other factors, the Texas court had turned to a 1992 manual for assessing mental disabilities, which has since been superseded by a more updated version that takes into account developments in mental health science.

Texas was based on the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, which has been interpreted to bar the death penalty both for children and for people like Moore, who has an average IQ score of 70.66. Moore, now 57, was convicted of capital murder in 1980.Ginsburg noted that Texas couldn’t “satisfactorily explain why it applies current medical standards for diagnosing intellectual disability in other contexts,” such as public education or the juvenile justice system, and “yet clings to superseded standards when an individual’s life is at stake.”“If the States were to have complete autonomy to define intellectual disability as they wished,” Ginsburg wrote, the 2002 decision exempting the intellectually disabled from execution “could become a nullity, and the Eighth Amendment’s protection of human dignity would not become a reality.”“States have some flexibility, but not unfettered discretion, in enforcing” the Supreme Court’s prior rulings in this area of law, Ginsburg added.The decision was joined by Justices Anthony Kennedy, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito.The majority’s approach “constitutionalizes rules for which there is not even clinical consensus,” Roberts said, and provides little guidance to states on what constitutes a proper assessment of intellectual disability.The bottom line for the dissenters was that “clinicians, not judges, should determine clinical standards; and judges, not clinicians, should determine the content of the Eighth Amendment.”A spokeswoman for the Texas attorney general’s office said the state was disappointed in the ruling but declined further comment.In an unrelated decision issued last month that also looked at the Texas death penalty system, the Supreme Court ordered a new sentencing for an inmate who had been condemned to death on the basis of racist testimony introduced by his defense attorney. Roberts was in the majority in that case.The issue of capital punishment deeply divides the justices. Breyer has on repeated occasions called for a case to consider whether the death penalty itself is unconstitutional."

The decision effectively gives the prisoner, Bobby James Moore, the opportunity to be re-sentenced, most likely to life in prison.The justices have been raising the bar on the sentencing of people with mental disabilities over the last several years. In a landmark 2002 ruling, the court said the Constitution prohibits states from imposing the death penalty on the intellectually disabled. In 2014, the justices explained that courts determining intellectual disability can’t just rely on rigid metrics and must look to the judgment of medical experts.Tuesday’s 5-to-3 decision said the factors that the Texas state court considered in weighing Moore’s level of impairment create “an unacceptable risk that persons with intellectual disability will be executed.”Among other factors, the Texas court had turned to a 1992 manual for assessing mental disabilities, which has since been superseded by a more updated version that takes into account developments in mental health science.

A seventh-round draft pick of the San Francisco 49ers in 2009, Jean Francois ― now on his fourth contract with his fourth team ― just completed his seventh season.Sustaining a career in the NFL is not easy. The average career lasts just over 3 years, the lowest of any of the four main sports in the U.S., and that includes practice squad players who never even play in a game. Also, NFL contracts are not guaranteed, meaning players ― even stars ― can be cut at any time.Before inking a deal with the Packers, Jean Francois enjoyed two productive seasons with the Washington Redskins, playing in all 32 possible games, seven of which he started, while recording 57 tackles, including 3.5 sacks.Just how rare is such production from a seventh-round selection?According to a 2015 study by Forbes, the median of “percentage of games started” by seventh-round picks from the 2010 draft from 2010-2015 is 0 percent. In other words, the mere fact that Jean Francois has become a starter while more than doubling the NFL career average is almost unheard of.As a result, the tech-obsessed 30-year-old ― who was cut by Washington despite having one more year on his contract ― has a unique perspective when looking ahead to life after pro football. Despite being a star player and winning a national title at college football powerhouse Louisiana State University, he knew the odds of a career weren’t especially high. Developing his business acumen became a priority for him early on.“During my rookie season, I spent a lot of money,” he says. “I was like, ‘Do I really want to be this type of guy?’ I didn’t want to just spend money, because you won’t get it back. ... The next year you couldn’t pay me to spend a dime.“After I signed a contract with the Colts [in 2013], I realized that I needed a retirement plan.” According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, 78 percent of NFL players go broke within three years of retirement and 15.7 percent file for bankruptcy within 12 years of retirement.The 6-foot-3, 313-pound Jean Francois ― this year’s proud recipient of the Redskins’ Media Good Guy Award ― did not want to become one of those statistics.So Jean Francois started to ask around the league ― talking to veterans, coaches and anyone who would offer advice. He started to educate himself, going through an assortment of different business and economic publications. Forbes, Fortune and Bloomberg are his favorites.With the help of his financial manager, he then purchased a Dunkin’ Donuts location in Georgia. Before long, he owned 25 franchises throughout the South, and he still has plans to expand to Houston. He committed himself to the business in every offseason, understanding the nuances of the business as he would an NFL playbook. At first, it was a grueling process, learning about projections and parsing through spreadsheets. But soon, it became second nature. He still feels a thrill every time one of his stores beats the sales projections.“It opened up another world I didn’t know existed,” Jean Francois adds. “I have to be hands-on so I can see everything grow. I gotta learn how to do it myself.”When challenges ― such as consistency in the product and service ― presented themselves, Jean Francois leaned on his football background and his experience working with a team. But he’s never had a problem with a single employee.“Football helped me mentally, because I had to get my mind right,” he says.“Making sure everybody has a positive vibe,” Jean Francois says, is paramount. “I gotta make sure that I set the mindset of people in there to be happy. Teamwork is the most important thing. It can make things work better. In other words, if football is a brotherhood, business is a community.“[Business] helped me become a better person,” he says. “Business makes you open up as a person, because now you’re more well-rounded. Early on in the NFL, you get influenced by the Rolls-Royces, the Ferraris, the Lambos. The next thing you know, you’re broke and out of the league.”And while business has made Jean Francois smarter and more focused, it was the birth of his son six months ago that changed his perception of life. “My son ― when he looks at me, I want to be the right father figure,” Jean Francois says. “He inspires me. I thought I grew up already, but when he came along, I was like, ‘Okay, I really didn’t grow up.’ When I look at him, it all makes sense.”These days, Jean Francois ― who is of Haitian descent ― sees inspiration everywhere, including in frequent trips to the small Caribbean island nation as a means of giving back to local communities in need.But the question still remains: What will life after football look like?His $3 million deal with the Packers is only for the 2017-18 season. Then, he’s not sure where he’s headed, but he does have one big idea, despite lacking any tangible experience within the stock market.“I’d like start a hedge fund,” Jean Francois says.Another option, though, is heading back to school.He wants to earn an Executive MBA in his hometown at the University of Miami, through a new Artists and Athletes program that has drawn rave reviews. Created in 2015 and aimed in large part toward football players, it employs a schedule that allows players to train early in the morning before going to nine hours of classes complemented by late-night study sessions.To be sure, it’s no easy task, but Jean Francois certainly thinks it can be done.

They even appeared with astronaut Kay Hire and showed the movie “Hidden Figures,” a story about the achievements of African-American women at NASA. Trump paid homage to the women featured in the movie for “paving the way for greater representation of women and African-Americans in these fields.” “My father’s administration has expanded NASA’s space exploration mission and added Mars as a key objective,” she added.President Donald Trump’s 2018 budget, however severely undercuts this women-friendly image put forward by DeVos and his daughter Tuesday. If Trump gets his way, his budget will eliminate the $115 million NASA Office of Education. The popular NASA initiative provides internships, enrichment programs, camps and scholarships for young scientists, and tries to get more underrepresented communities into STEM.Advocates say it’s a critical way for more women and minorities to enter these fields, and that axing it would be devastating.“It’s how I started my career in the space industry. It’s how so many people I know got started in the space industry,” Laura Seward Forczyk, a planetary scientist, told The Washington Post. “Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Ivanka Trump are feigning an interest in STEM careers with a photo op at the National Air and Space Museum while eliminating all funding for NASA’s education programs. This takes chutzpah to a new level,” said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers labor union.Growing up in Virginia, Leland Melvin thought he was going to go to college and eventually play professional football. But then he learned about a NASA program that would pay for him to take classes towards his master’s degree in materials science engineering. After a football injury sidelined his original plans, he continued his science education with additional NASA funding ― all funneled through the NASA Office of Education.“If it hadn’t been for NASA Education I wouldn’t have been funded to go to school, to work at NASA Langley, to become an astronaut,” Melvin told The Washington Post. He eventually went on to run the education office as well. NASA has said that if the education office is eliminated, it will absorb those programs into the Science Mission Directorate, another office at the agency. The directorate’s budget for education and outreach, however, is much smaller, meaning some of the education office’s programs would still be cut or eliminated. The president recently signed legislation that requires NASA to encourage more women and girls to go into STEM, even though his budget takes away critical funds for such efforts. His budget also proposes taking away billions from the federal Pell Grant program, which helps low-income students attend college.Ivanka Trump didn’t mention these cuts at the event Tuesday, although she did reveal that she and her 5-year-old daughter will be attending a coding class this summer.Want more updates from Amanda Terkel?

So they began brainstorming ways to do just that three years ago.“We were wondering how to bring our community into psychology and psychology into the community,” Anderson, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania who serves as a therapist to Black families in Philadelphia, told The Huffington Post last week. In December, they began uploading videos to YouTube as part of a series titled “Our Mental Health Minute.” The series, targeted toward black audiences, serves as a quick and relatable mental health resource, particularly for those seeking some form of consultation but hindered by the stigmatization of mental health care. Anderson said the pair set out with three goals: to reduce the stigma surrounding mental health care in the black community, heighten mental health literacy and provide access to mental health resources. In the series, Anderson and Jones act out scenarios to segue into crucial subjects of mental health like depression, racial socialization of black youth, drinking, anxiety and PTSD.“The goal really isn’t to necessarily have stardom [or] necessarily go viral. We really want people to digest and interact with this content. So [it’s] less about subscription,” Anderson said. In the videos, they even reference events like the killing of Michael Brown and footage of Hillary Clinton’s “super-predators” comment that circulated during election season to emphasize the impact racism can have on the mental health of the black community. Jones, who is also a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania and who studies racial socialization in black communities, said that the two chose YouTube as the primary platform for their channel, Ri and CT, because of the success they’ve witnessed similar series have with the video site. Anderson and Jones believe that in order to improve the relationship between black people and mental health care, psychologists have some work to do as well.“Black folks, in particular, have had ― whether it’s in the general medical field or also mental health ― negative experiences,” Jones said. “So there’s [this] mistrust of the system of service provision.”Anderson said that similar to the process of applying for a job, when black people do seek out therapy, an ethnic-sounding name may be the reason psychologists don’t return a voicemail from a potential client. Additionally, when providers do service black clients, Anderson said she wants them to know that cultural differences can cause misunderstanding. “Being strong or looking like you have it all together may not be the full picture when you have a black client,” she said. “So I think we have to work on both sides of that issue as well.” Check out Anderson and Jones’ “Our Mental Health Minute” videos here."

But Navalny and his supporters hope to channel public discontent over corruption to get more support.Navalny, who will appeal the court’s verdict, was found guilty of disobeying a police officer at Sunday’s Moscow protest and sentenced to 15 days in jail. He was also fined for organizing the protest, which the authorities said was illegal.Navalny told reporters in the Moscow courtroom that he and his allies would not give up.“You can’t detain tens of thousands of people,” he said. “Yesterday we saw the authorities can only go so far.”Police detained more than 1,000 protesters across Russia on Sunday as crowds took to the streets, at Navalny’s urging, to demonstrate against corruption and demand the resignation of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev.Medvedev’s spokeswoman has dismissed corruption allegations against him as “propagandistic attacks”.Navalny said Russians would keep protesting for “as long as people see tens of billions of dollars being stolen by top officials”.The Kremlin dismissed the protests as an illegal provocation and rejected U.S. and European Union calls to free detainees like Navalny.“We can’t agree with these calls,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call, saying the police had been professional and properly enforced Russian law.He said the Kremlin had no problem with people expressing their opinions at protest meetings, but the timing and location had to be agreed with authorities in advance, something he said had not been done in large part on Sunday.“We can’t respect people who deliberately misled minors - in essence children - calling on them to take part in illegal actions in unsanctioned places and offering them certain rewards to do so, thus putting their lives at risk,” said Peskov.A Reuters reporter saw Navalny being loaded into a van after his court appearance. It was surrounded by supporters holding placards reading” “We believe” and “Alexei, we are with you.” Police then detained the group of around 20 young people.(Editing by Andrew Roche)"

The premise of the book is straightforward: Europe’s failure to recognize and combat tyranny in the past had tragic results that can, at least, provide lessons for the future.Rather than pontificating on this idea, Snyder bullet-points blunt advice. “Anticipatory obedience is a political tragedy,” he begins in the book’s first chapter, before briskly segueing into historical evidence for his claim. In 1938, he writes, Austrian Nazis stole Jewish property and bystanders either partook or looked on, rather than dissenting. To prevent that from happening again, Snyder outlines actionable guidance.Taking his message a step further, Snyder’s publisher worked with a crew of artists who adapted it into posters, which appeared as a public art project in East London on Monday.The book’s entire text is published on a series of posters designed by students at Kingston University ― “as a tool, a provocation and a rallying call,” the publisher said in a statement. They’ll be on view for one week.“Be kind to our language,” one poster reads in big, playful lettering. “Avoid pronouncing the phrases everyone else does,” it continues. The text suggests instead finding new ways to phrase old ideas, to insure that we pause and reflect rather than merely regurgitating powerful, pathos-appealing rhetoric.“Learn from peers in other countries,” another poster reads. “... No country is going to find a solution by itself,” it continues.The posters filter Snyder’s salient advice into palatable sayings, serving as reminders that there’s more to communication than noisy exclamations.

The building rises from one base, curves over in a U shape, and touches the ground again at its second base.Oiio says the design is meant to creatively solve challenges that builders face due to zoning laws in New York City.“But what if we substituted height with length? What if our buildings were long instead of tall?” the building proposal on Oiio’s website asks. “If we manage to bend our structure instead of bending the zoning rules of New York, we would be able to create one of the most prestigious buildings in Manhattan. The longest building in the world.”Not everyone is excited by the prospect of a record-setting building, however. Architectural Digest shared images of the proposed structure with the headline “This Skyscraper Could Ruin New York’s Skyline.”Curbed New York says it’s improbable the project would ever become a reality.“It seems highly unlikely that a project like this would ever get off the ground, so to speak—community members and preservation groups (including the Municipal Art Society) have already condemned the rise of supertalls along Central Park South, so adding another one to the mix couldn’t possibly go over well,” the website explained.The building would measure 200 feet higher than One World Trade Center, the tallest building in the city, Business Insider noted.See a selection of Oiio’s images of the building below."

It comes amid mounting U.S. concerns about additional missile and nuclear tests, potentially in the near future.Several U.S. officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the test took place on Friday night and the engine could possibly be used in an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).Earlier this month North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said his country had conducted a test of a new high-thrust engine at its Tongchang-ri rocket launch station, saying it was “a new birth” of its rocket industry.At the time, North Korea’s official media said the engine would help it achieve world-class satellite launch capability, indicating the test was of a new type of rocket engine for long-range missiles.Kim also has said North Korea is close to an ICBM test-launch.North Korea has been testing rocket engines and heat-shields for an ICBM while developing the technology to guide a missile after re-entry into the atmosphere following a liftoff, experts have said.Once fully developed, a North Korean ICBM could threaten the continental United States, which is around 9,000 km (5,500 miles) from the North. ICBMs have a minimum range of about 5,500 km (3,400 miles), but some are designed to travel 10,000 km (6,200 miles) or farther.The reclusive state has conducted five nuclear tests and a series of missile launches in defiance of U.N. resolutions.U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said during a visit to the region that a military response would be “on the table” if Pyongyang took action to threaten South Korea and U.S. forces.The Trump administration is still deliberating its policy on North Korea, but appears to be giving priority to less risky options than pre-emptive military strikes.It is considering sweeping sanctions aimed at cutting North Korea off from the global financial system as part of a broad review of measures to counter Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile threat.(Reporting by Idrees Ali and Phil Stewart; Editing by James Dalgleish)"

He had not been convicted of any terrorism offense.“His attack method appears to be based on low sophistication, low tech, low cost techniques copied from other attacks, and echo the rhetoric of IS leaders in terms of methodology and attacking police and civilians, but at this stage I have no evidence he discussed this with others,” Basu said in a statement.“I know when, where and how Masood committed his atrocities, but now I need to know why,” he said, appealing to anyone who may have been in contact with him on the day of the attack to come forward.Masood was born Adrian Russell Ajao and on Monday his mother Janet Ajao issued a statement saying was “shocked, saddened and numbed” by his actions.“I do not condone his actions nor support the beliefs he held that led to him committing this atrocity,” she added.Interior minister Amber Rudd said on Sunday that technology companies should cooperate more with law enforcement agencies and should stop providing “a secret place for terrorists to communicate” using encrypted messages.Media have reported that Masood sent an encrypted message moments before the attack.“There has been much speculation about who Masood was in contact with immediately prior to the attack,” Basu said. “All I will say on this point is that Masood’s communications that day are a main line of enquiry.”(Reporting by Estelle Shirbon; editing by Stephen Addison)"

Nunes said he has seen reports from the U.S. intelligence agencies that show communication from members of President Donald Trump's transition team and the president himself were incidentally collected.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d929b01d0000f42c7d0a77.jpeg?cache=smZ6E8pm8N&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) met a source on White House grounds last week, one day before he alleged that President Donald Trump and his team were subjected to surveillance during the final months of the Obama administration. Nunes met the source on White House grounds in order to view sensitive information in a “secure location,” Jack Langer, Nunes’ communications director, said Monday in a statement, CNN first reported.There are sensitive compartmented information facilities ― known as SCIFs ― on Capitol Hill. But using a congressional facility would have required the source to illegally transport the documents, Langer told The Huffington Post. “The information comprised executive branch documents that have not been provided to Congress. Because of classification rules, the source could not simply put the documents in a backpack and walk them over to the House Intelligence Committee space,” he wrote in an email. “The White House grounds was the best location to safeguard the proper chain of custody and classification of these documents, so the Chairman could view them in a legal way.” Only individuals with specific approval can enter White House grounds.Langer’s explanation of why Nunes met his source on White House grounds is “disingenuous and misleading, at a minimum,” Bradley Moss, a lawyer specializing in national security law, told HuffPost. “There are countless intelligence officials who are authorized to transport classified materials between facilities using secure lock bags,” Moss said. “It would be reasonable to expect that someone who has unsupervised access to surveillance orders located on a classified network would also have been designated as an authorized courier.”In an interview with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Monday evening, Nunes insisted there was nothing “clandestine” about his visit. He also denied coordinating with White House officials and said he is “quite sure people in the West Wing had no idea I was there.” He declined, however, to say who in the executive branch cleared his visit.Nunes also wouldn’t say which Trump associates were named in the intelligence documents he reviewed on the White House grounds but said they had “nothing to do with Russia.” The revelation about Nunes’ White House visit adds to speculation that he coordinated with Trump’s team before making allegations about the previous administration’s information-gathering. The day after meeting with his source, Nunes told reporters that he had viewed several dozen reports showing that members of Trump’s team ― and possibly the president himself ― were the subjects of “incidental” collection during routine surveillance targeting suspected foreign spies. He said the surveillance was legal but that he was concerned that the names of Trump surrogates were “unmasked” in internal intelligence reports. After briefing reporters, Nunes went to the White House to share his revelations with Trump, whose team is being investigated by the FBI for possible ties to Russian government officials who allegedly interfered in the 2016 U.S. election. Asked several times last week to confirm that he did not receive his information from the White House, Nunes avoided answering directly. “You can ask me every single name that exists on the planet and I’m still not going to tell you who our sources are,” he said Friday. After Nunes’ White House visit was made public on Monday, he told BloombergView that his source was an “intelligence official,” not a member of the National Security Council.Democrats viewed Nunes’ disclosures as a political stunt aimed at rehabilitating Trump’s credibility after the FBI director and a bipartisan smattering of lawmakers ― including Nunes himself ― disavowed the president’s claim that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) on Monday called on House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) to remove Nunes from his position as head of the House Intelligence Committee. “Chairman Nunes is falling down on the job and seems to be more interested in protecting the president than in seeking the truth,” Schumer said.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi described Nunes last week as being “deeply compromised” and accused him either being “duped” by the White House or acting as a “willing stooge.” Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the ranking member on the intelligence committee, repeated previous calls for an independent commission to investigate ties between the Trump campaign and Moscow. Nunes, who was a member of Trump’s transition team, did not notify Schiff or other committee members before his announcement last week. He denies that he is unfit to lead the committee’s investigation into Russian election interference because he says the reports he viewed do not mention Russia ― but he has not shared those reports with other members of the committee.Nunes and Schiff asked the heads of the National Security Agency, the FBI and the CIA earlier this month for information about Americans who have been named in internal intelligence reports after being swept up in surveillance efforts. Nunes told reporters he expects to receive a response early this week.The chairman has backed down from his most explosive claim ― that Trump was personally subjected to incidental intelligence collection ― saying he won’t know for sure until he hears back from intelligence and law enforcement officials.

Alexander’s results traced back to his great-grandmother Anna Jones, without going into her story.But Alexander was able to dive deeper into his lineage in fall 2016 when he received an unexpected email from a distant cousin, Melissa Kemp, who helped him connect the dots. The two had a conversation about older relatives they shared, according to the Times.When Alexander brought up Jones’ name, Kemp went two generations back and informed him of Anna Mahoney Jones, his earliest known ancestor and one of the women sold by two Jesuit priests at Georgetown University to help the school survive.Mahoney Jones was one of 272 slaves sold. The university made a total of about $115,000, or $3.3 million in today’s dollars, according to the Times. Mahoney Jones was enslaved at a plantation in Ascension Parish, Louisiana, along with her two children, 9-year-old Arnold and 6-year-old Louisa.Alexander, who’s an executive assistant in Georgetown’s Office of Technology Commercialization, said finding this out has been quite stirring.“Now I work here — to realize that this is my history, this is my story, blows me away,” he told the Times. “I have been really emotional as I learned about my ties to the university.”Alexander said he wasn’t angry about the university’s ties because “it was the way the United States operated at the time.” But he said that he was happy to see Georgetown “has worked to right the wrong.”Georgetown is currently trying to atone for its involvement in slavery. In 2015, alum Richard J. Cellini organized the nonprofit Georgetown Memory Project to trace the 272 enslaved people to their descendants. That same year, the university agreed to remove the names of the college presidents involved in the sale from two campus buildings.In September, President John J. DeGioia announced that those descendants would be awarded preferential status in the admission process. According to The Washington Post, Georgetown will hold a religious ceremony in April as an apology for its ties to the slave trade."

In the new position, Kushner, 36, will be granted sweeping authority to overhaul the federal bureaucracy and attempt to meet Trump’s campaign promises. The business strategies Kushner aims to utilize could include privatizing some government tasks, the Post reported. “All Americans, regardless of their political views, can recognize that government stagnation has hindered our ability to properly function, often creating widespread congestion and leading to cost overruns and delays,” Trump said a statement. He also said the new team would apply his own “ahead-of-schedule, under-budget mentality to the government.”Kushner’s new role comes days after a major failure by the Trump administration to get the GOP health care bill passed. The measure was pulled Friday when it became clear that Republicans couldn’t muster the votes necessary for passage.Early projects of the White House Office of American Innovation will include revamping the Veterans Affairs system and addressing America’s opioid addiction problem, which would seem to be a particularly daunting use of business strategies.The team will be staffed by former business executives, such as National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn; Reed Cordish, assistant to the president for intra-governmental and technology initiatives; former Goldman Sachs executive Dina Powell, who is currently deputy national security adviser and senior counselor to the president for economic initiatives; and Chris Liddell, assistant to the president for strategic initiatives, CBS News reported. The new job adds yet another duty to an already full plate for Ivanka Trump’s husband. A senior adviser to the president, Kushner is also a key foreign policy adviser and the point person in charge of helping to secure Israeli-Palestinian peace."

Tara Lenich, a former supervisory assistant district attorney with the Brooklyn District Attorney’s Office, was charged with two counts of illegal interception of communications in an indictment unsealed Monday, according to the Justice Department.Authorities said Lenich forged the signatures of several judges so she could get wiretaps placed on cellphones belonging to the NYPD narcotics detective and a married prosecutor in her office, who Lenich suspected were having an affair. “Tara Lenich violated her duty to the public when she engaged in a long-running scheme to forge judicial documents in order to illegally wiretap telephones,” Bridget M. Rohde, acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said in a Monday press release.According to The New York Daily News, Lenich and the narcotics detective had worked together for 11 years, and Lenich regarded him as a love interest. She reportedly feared the detective was romantically involved with her co-worker. It’s unclear whether the affair was fantasy or reality, the Daily News reported.The fraudulent judicial orders allowed Lenich to intercept communications on the two cellphones from June 2015 to November 2016, authorities said. Lenich also was accused of forging search warrants to obtain text messages on the phones.When subordinates questioned Lenich about the wiretaps, she claimed she was working with the Internal Affairs Bureau, the Daily News reported, citing anonymous sources. At the time, Lenich was a deputy chief in the Violent Criminal Enterprises Bureau.The ruse unraveled when a staffer reviewing the wiretap paperwork recognized the cellphone number of a co-worker. Authorities searched Lenich’s computer and said they discovered nearly two dozen forged documents.Lenich was fired last year after she was arrested on state charges involving forgery and eavesdropping. The federal counts replace the state charges, officials said.If convicted, Lenich could be punished with up to five years’ imprisonment on each count.David Lohr covers crime and missing persons.

39,POLITICS,Maybe Getting Tight With Rep. Devin Nunes Wasn’t Such A Hot Idea For Trump,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-nunes-spicer_us_58d9781de4b0f805b322745e,The intel committee chair’s evolving tale leaves the White House press secretary trying to keep up.,2017-03-27,House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) tells reporters after his meeting at the White House on Wednesday that he has seen reports from intelligence agencies that show communication from members of President Trump's transition team and the president himself were incidentally collected.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d97cbb1d0000f42c7d0c69.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump’s White House probably wishes now it had never even heard of Rep. Devin Nunes.Not a week after calling attention to the House Intelligence Committee chairman’s claims about suspicious surveillance of Trump’s transition team, White House press secretary Sean Spicer on Monday sounded like he was done talking about the California Republican.“I know that Chairman Nunes has confirmed that he was on White House grounds Tuesday and, frankly, any questions regarding who he met with or why he was here should be referred to him,” Spicer said.Spicer’s new tone comes as Nunes continues trying to explain why it was that he went to the White House on March 21 to receive documents from a source only to head back to the White House on March 22 to brief Trump on what he had learned. Nunes told Bloomberg News that his source was an intelligence official, not a White House employee.Spicer, meanwhile, claimed that he knew very little about the whole thing. “All of what I know has been available through public comments,” he said, referring to news accounts.Monday’s statements are the latest in the evolution of Spicer’s views on Nunes.Last Wednesday, Spicer went out of his way to make sure everyone had heard Nunes’ announcement that he had come to learn that Trump transition team members had been swept up by surveillance conducted by U.S. intelligence. Nunes’ committee is investigating possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russian spy agencies’ efforts to get Trump elected. “My understanding is that Chairman Nunes is coming to the White House later to brief the president on this development,” Spicer said.The next day, as Nunes was dodging questions as to where his new information came from, reporters asked Spicer whether the White House itself could have been Nunes’ source. Spicer ridiculed the question.“I don’t know that that make sense,” he said Thursday. “I don’t know why he would travel ― brief the speaker, then come down here to brief us on something that ― that we would’ve briefed him on. It doesn’t really seem to make a ton of sense. So, I’m not aware of it. But it doesn’t really pass the smell test.”But by Friday afternoon, after Nunes acknowledged that all the surveillance he was referring to was legal and had taken place as a result of court orders, Spicer again changed his tack when asked if he could rule out that Nunes’ source for his documents was from within the administration.“I don’t know where he got them from. He didn’t state it,” Spicer said. “I don’t have anything for you on that. So I cannot say anything more than ‘I don’t know’ at this point.”Monday, prior to Spicer’s daily briefing, the White House put out a statement referring all questions about Nunes’ newly disclosed visit to the White House complex to Nunes himself ― a request that reporters did not honor, forcing Spicer to spend much of the briefing trying to distance the White House from an increasingly embattled ally.Democrats are demanding that House Speaker Paul Ryan replace Nunes as chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence because of his open coordination with Trump, arguing that Nunes cannot lead an impartial investigation into Trump’s team.During his campaign last year, Trump frequently praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, even saying Putin was a better leader than President Barack Obama. In the meantime, Putin’s spy agencies were secretly working to help Trump win by stealing and releasing potentially embarrassing documents about the campaign of Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton ― disclosures that Trump cited on a daily basis.FBI Director James Comey testified at a congressional hearing last week that his office has for nearly a year been conducting an investigation into whether Trump’s campaign colluded with Russian officials."

Yaver noted a recent HIV outbreak in Indiana following state legislators’ 2011 move to gut public funding for Planned Parenthood, which left one rural county devoid of HIV testing centers for more than two years.Despite earlier studies highlighting the positive effects that Planned Parenthood clinics have on women’s health, Republican lawmakers have been engaged in a decades-long crusade against the organization, which receives about $500 million a year in federal funding. Most of that comes through Medicaid.Many Planned Parenthood opponents criticize it for providing abortions, although the organization says abortions constitute just 3 percent of its services while contraception and STD testing and treatment make up 76 percent. Moreover, the 1976 Hyde Amendment bars the use of federal money to fund abortions in most cases. Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards has noted time and again that the government money that reaches the clinics pays for other health procedures like breast cancer screening and pap smears.The GOP plan to repeal and replace Obamacare would have eliminated federal funding for Planned Parenthood. For now, that legislation has stalled in Congress after House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) couldn’t deliver enough votes to secure its passage.Before the bill was pulled, President Donald Trump said he would consider maintaining Planned Parenthood’s federal funding if the organization pledged to halt abortion services. The offer was swiftly rejected.“Planned Parenthood is proud to provide abortion — a necessary service that’s as vital to our mission as birth control or cancer screenings,” Richards tweeted in response.In a Washington Post op-ed on Monday, Yaver warned that states’ “responsiveness to pro-life sentiment” could have negative “health and economic consequences.”Eliminating Planned Parenthood’s federal funding could increase the annual number of births, which would in turn drive up direct spending for Medicaid by millions of dollars a year, according to a Congressional Budget Office report earlier this month.“Reforming health policy is not easy,” Yaver wrote in her op-ed. “While responding to public opinion over abortion can help particular members of Congress get reelected, defunding Planned Parenthood may carry a significant price tag for their districts.”How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

The Hollywood diversity issue ― reported by journalists, researched by academics, dissected by insiders ― was, apparently, news to him. Or at least a topic on which he demonstrated shocking unfamiliarity. Variety reported on Sorkin’s “burning questions” during a discussion moderated by film critic Elvis Mitchell at the Writers Guild Festival in Hollywood on Saturday. According to people there, however, the talk was a genuinely compassionate one on the part of Sorkin, who invited input from those around him.“Are you saying that women and minorities have a more difficult time getting their stuff read than white men and you’re also saying that [white men] get to make mediocre movies and can continue on?” Sorkin asked, per Variety.“You’re saying that if you are a woman or a person of color, you have to hit it out of the park in order to get another chance?”While various reports have found slight gains in opportunities for women and minority screenwriters ― and other behind-the-scenes workers like directors and producers ― over recent years, the picture has been clear for some time. White people, and white men in particular, are given more opportunities to create on-screen entertainment.A most recent report, from the Writers Guild of America, West, released in 2016, found that women and minority writers were underrepresented in TV and film from 2012 to 2014. (Writers of color in television stood at just 13 percent during that time frame.) Another study, led by the same University of California at Los Angeles researcher and released in February, found similar results when 2015 shows and films were also taken into account. Such research has been practiced for years. The #OscarsSoWhite hashtag also dominated entertainment news cycles during awards season two years in a row, prompting a critical look at how race and gender is represented across all parts of the industry. How an accomplished writer like Sorkin could have missed the conversation is hard to imagine.But, for his part, Sorkin was eager to learn more and become a force for positive change. “I do want to understand what someone like me can do,” he said, per Variety.

In a new interview with the New York Daily News, James Jackson, 28 ― who told prosecutors last week that he planned to “kill as many black men as he could”― expressed no remorse over Timothy Caughman’s death, only regret that he had not killed a younger victim. “I didn’t know he was elderly,” Jackson told the Daily News, before suggesting that he would have rather killed “a young thug” or “a successful older black man with blondes ... people you see in midtown. These younger guys that put white girls on the wrong path.” Jackson, who is currently being held at Rikers Island, confessed to the crime last Wednesday, more than 24 hours after he struck Caughman with a 26-inch sword. He said he deliberately traveled from Baltimore to New York to carry out the crimes because it is the “media capital of the world,” and that he wanted to get maximum exposure for his violent hatred toward black men. He said he had been plotting to kill black men for years.“I had been thinking about it for a long time,” Jackson told the Daily News. “I figured I would end up getting shot by police, kill myself, or end up in jail.”Jackson, who grew up in an “almost all-white” neighborhood in Baltimore and was raised by “typical liberal” parents, said his ideal society is “1950s America.” He said he hoped that the bloodshed would lead white women to reject interracial relationships, even reportedly saying that their ideal response to his killings would be: “Well, if that guy feels so strongly about it, maybe I shouldn’t do it.” Jackson’s premeditated plans sound similar to those of Dylann Roof, who revealed that he shot and killed nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, in June 2015 partly because he thought it would protect white women from black men. “I have to do it. You rape our women and you’re taking over our country. And you have to go,” Roof reportedly said during his massacre.Roof’s claims reflect dangerous myths that paint black men as vile savages. And unpacking this trope requires digging deeper into the long history of white female sexuality being used by white men to justify racial violence. As for Jackson, when asked about the white women who are repulsed by his racist views and actions, he responded: “That’s the problem.” "

Gary Herbert (R) signed into law a bill that requires doctors to tell women that medication abortions can be reversed midway through the procedure. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists does not recommend women do so.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d97b7e2c00002100ff0bde.jpeg?cache=SkllkdRAaW&ops=crop_0_106_3190_2117%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK― Utah Gov. Gary Herbert (R) signed a bill into law this weekend that requires doctors to tell women that medication abortions can be reversed midway through the process ― a claim that is unsupported by science.Medication abortions involve taking two separate medications, mifepristone and misoprostol, within two days of each other. The first drug blocks progesterone and sheds the uterine lining, and the second causes a full miscarriage. The Utah law, passed by the GOP-controlled House and Senate, claims that a woman can stop her abortion after taking the first pill by ingesting the hormone progesterone. Doctors’ groups dispute that theory. “Claims of medication abortion reversal are not supported by the body of scientific evidence,” the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said in a statement, “and this approach is not recommended in ACOG’s clinical guidance on medication abortion.” The author of the bill, Rep. Kevin Stratton (R), said it helps women be more “educated” about their decision. “If you’re pro-choice, I would say that it helps you be educated in making the choice,” he said in an interview with the Deseret News. “If you’re pro-life, it gives an opportunity to look at the options if a decision is made to reverse course.”Republicans in five states have passed or tried to pass “abortion reversal” bills, and a federal judge in Arizona blocked a similar law in 2015 after ACOG called it “tantamount to quackery.” The legislation is based on a single study of six women who had taken a dose of mifepristone and then tried to reverse their abortions. Four of the women in the study were able to continue their pregnancies. But mifepristone alone only works 30 to 50 percent of the time to end a pregnancy, so researchers say there is insufficient evidence to claim that it was the dose of progesterone that halted the abortions. The Utah bill is the latest in a trend of state legislatures encouraging doctors to give women false or incomplete information about abortion. Last week, the Texas Senate approved a bill that would permit doctors to lie to women about fetal abnormalities in order to discourage them from choosing abortion. And Republican lawmakers in Texas and Kansas have passed legislation requiring doctors to tell women that abortion is linked to breast cancer ― another medically unsupported claim. But “abortion reversal” laws could actually put women’s health in danger by encouraging them to take a hormone that “can cause significant cardiovascular, nervous system and endocrine adverse reactions as well as other side effects,” according to ACOG. The doctors’ group recommends that instead of listening to politicians, women who change their minds halfway through a medication abortion have the same chance of success by “doing nothing and waiting to see what happens.” "

Throughout the fall semester, Vanessa Mewborn, 16, and Ariana Coleman, 17, interviewed students and faculty at Buckingham Charter Magnet School in Vacaville, California, about their thoughts on the BLM movement for a yearbook article. The article was titled “Celebrating being American: Clarity on Black Lives Matter” and led with the question: “How do you feel about the Black Lives Matter movement?” The article included a picture of Mewborn, Coleman and two other young women with their fists raised as a message of black power. After an extensive editing process by the school’s principal, the two saw that the article they submitted in January was stripped of all mentions of BLM. Fearing potential controversy from the article, Principal Mike Boles not only changed its title to “We Are Buckingham,” but the question that served as the basis for the interviews was altered to read, “How do you feel about the current world climate that has caused cultural divisions?” He also removed the black power photo. In March, Mewborn and Coleman took their concerns to the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California. The organization wrote a letter to the Vacaville Unified School District Superintendent Jane Shamieh pointing out the principal’s unlawful use of censorship in the article. The letter cited a California education code that states students have the ultimate authority over student-run publications. On March 21, less than a week after receiving the letter, the school district complied with the ACLU’s request to publish the original piece and include the photo. While Mewborn and Coleman were both elated that their article would be published with its original content, Coleman told the ACLU that the significance of their win went beyond an article. “This victory is more than the page itself,” she said. “It’s a reflection of who I am and who our ancestors have fought for us to be, to never give up, and to fight for what is right. There is nothing wrong with being proud of who I am and where I come from so yes, black lives matter. All lives matter. My voice matters.”"

Following up their 2005 breakthrough album, “From Under The Cork Tree,” the band released “Infinity on High,” ― a record that was largely dedicated to their first interactions with fame ― in February 2007.“FUCT” had sold 3 million copies and produced two of the catchiest, radio-friendly rock singles of the mid-aughts; “Sugar, We’re Going Down” and “Dance, Dance.” In a few short years the band, comprising singer Patrick Stump, guitarist Joe Trohman, drummer Andy Hurley and bassist, lyricist and de facto frontman Pete Wentz, had gone from sleeping on strangers’ floors to headlining arena tours.And Wentz ― one of the few male celebrities to endure a nude photo leak ― embraced his newfound fame as rumors he was romancing Michelle Trachtenberg, Lindsay Lohan and Ashlee Simpson swirled, while his clothing line and record label, among other business ventures, helped the band earn the nickname “Sell Out Boy.”“Rock guys are like, ‘Fuck, I don’t want to do stuff like that.’ But look at the state of rock music. Bands can’t sell fucking records. The new rock stars are dudes like Jay-Z,” he told Rolling Stone in 2006, adding that he wanted Fall Out Boy to be “a culture. You’re going to eat, sleep and breathe it. I want it to be a way you think about the world.” A year later he told the magazine, “I want to be the biggest band on the planet.”Those statements are at odds with many of the lyrics on “Infinity on High,” which is a largely a meditation on the perils of fame. It’s also why Def Jam president Jay Z is the first voice you hear on the album’s first track, “Thriller.” We dedicate this album to anybody people said couldn’t make it. To the fans that held us down till everybody came around, welcome. It’s here. It’s also a reminder of just how the band had come. Monday marks 10 years since Fall Out Boy released the album’s third single, “Thnks fr th Mmrs,” and, like the video for the their previous single “This Ain’t A Scene, It’s An Arms Race,” it touched on the absurdities of fame. This time around, it showed the band filming a video while being directed by a chimpanzee. While the song itself is mostly about a broken relationship, it also alluded to the Hollywood starlets to whom Wentz was romantically linked, as in lyrics like, “They say I only think in the form of crunching numbers / In hotel rooms collecting Page Six lovers.” Ironically, the video co-starred Kim Kardashian as Wentz’s love interest. At the time, Kardashian was just starting to earn her own headlines in Page Six. She was then best known as Paris Hilton’s friend. Her sex tape leaked just a month before FOB’s video dropped. “I’m a fan of Fall Out Boy and I agreed to do it,” Kardashian told Newstimes in 2007. “And it was so much fun working with them. ... I think music videos kind of all show the same thing. They kind of want a hot girl and cool cars. This one was totally different.” The band couldn’t have known that Kardashian would go on to become the reigning tabloid queen, but Wentz quickly became a tabloid fixture as soon as he revealed he was dating Ashlee Simpson, whom he’d been linked to since 2006. The band’s success and Wentz’s love life weighed on the band. Their next album, “Folie a Deux,” focused on themes similar to their last. “Rock stars have been making records about rock stardom for decades, but few have had such fun singing about the absurdities, the narcissism — and, as the album title suggests, the follies — of a life lived in fame’s strobelit glare,” Rolling Stone’s Jody Rosen wrote in a review of the 2008 album. When the band announced they were going on an indefinite hiatus in November 2009, Wentz told Kerrang! that he felt his high-profile relationship with Simpson and his personal life had become a “hindrance for the band.”“I think the world needs a little less Pete Wentz. A lot of people think Fall Out Boy is me. But it’s the four of us. I want to fucking vomit when I read intros that say, ‘Pete Wentz: accidental internet poster boy.’ It makes me feel ugly,” the band’s frontman explained at the time.The band’s hiatus lasted three years. Fall Out Boy has since released two albums. When the 10th anniversary of “Infinity on High” rolled around last month, Wentz reflected on the album in a short blog post on the band’s website:this one was strange. it was transitional. If FUCT was the caterpillar album- Infinity On High was the cocoon one. we had been on tour around the world nonstop but hadn’t really seen any of the magazine covers we were on or had any perspective of seeing our videos on TRL- it was odd how everything was changing but it felt like we were in a time capsule… this record would bring so many ideas from jay z doing the intro to working with baby face on “thnks fr th mmrs” to the flight 101 saga (3 shows in a day in ny, chicago, and la)… but first and foremost it documented this blur that had become our lives. this record more than any of the others has always reminded me of night time- both the anxiety of insomnia and the peace of being awake when everyone else is asleep. i remember before we released it i used like a security blanket listening and trying to fall asleep. i really appreciate everyone who gave this one a chance.

Wong,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/north-carolina-childrens-book_us_58d948bbe4b03787d35aca1f,First graders in a North Carolina school district won't be reading Jacob's New Dress.,2017-03-27,A conservative North Carolina group called <em>Jacob's New Dress</em> inappropriate “for any child whose parents support traditional family values.”,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d966661d0000f42c7d0bde.jpeg?cache=8n1dxek4Ky&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A pair of children’s authors is firing back after a North Carolina school district scrapped plans to incorporate their book about a gender non-conforming boy into its anti-bullying curriculum. Charlotte-Mecklenburg school administrators had been planning to use Jacob’s New Dress, about a young boy who likes to wear dresses, in first-grade classes as part of Child Abuse Prevention Month in April. On Friday, however, Superintendent Ann Clark told The New York Times that the 2014 book had been replaced “due to some concerns” about content. Michael Hall’s Red: A Crayon’s Story, which follows a blue crayon misidentified with a red label, would be read instead. Written by Sarah and Ian Hoffman, Jacob’s New Dress had been criticized by the N.C. Values Coalition, which supports “standards in higher education that do not violate religious freedom and free speech rights of students” and is opposed to same-sex marriage, according to its website.“The purpose of our elementary schools is to teach writing, reading and arithmetic, not to encourage boys to wear dresses,” an N.C. Values Coalition official wrote in a statement to The Charlotte Observer. Jacob’s New Dress, the official argued, was “not appropriate for any child whose parents support traditional family values.”The Hoffmans, who reside in California, said the furor that Jacob’s New Dress had generated was “confusing,” telling The Charlotte Observer that their book’s message was one of “love and acceptance.” The couple based the book on their experiences raising their 14-year-old son, Sam, who favored pink and once asked to wear a dress to preschool. Speaking to The Huffington Post, Ian Hoffman dismissed the N.C. Values Coalition’s claim that Jacob’s New Dress encouraged boys to wear dresses. “Our hope, when we wrote this book, was that someday it would be considered quaint,” he said. “We imagined future generations saying, ‘What was the fuss about?’ Clearly, there’s more work to do ... our book is a small piece of a much larger effort to build a more empathetic, compassionate culture.”In an interview with The Charlotte Observer, Sarah Hoffman echoed those sentiments, arguing against the implication that the book would somehow turn children gay or transgender. “If a white kid reads a book about Martin Luther King Jr.,” she said, “will they become black?”The couple’s book has stirred controversy before. In 2015, some parents of kindergarten students in Pennsylvania’s Lampeter-Strasburg School District objected to Jacob’s New Dress being read to their children without prior notification.An area pastor also spoke out against the book in an interview with Lancaster Online at the time, saying that a family associated with his church was troubled since they had a child in the class where the book had been read. “I am not suggesting that any of the school officials are pushing the gay agenda, yet their actions give the appearance that they are,” Pastor Jamie Mitchell of Harvest Bible Chapel said. He called upon Lampeter-Strasburg school administrators to “apologize, take responsibility and then publicly promise never to introduce this kind of material with this kind of agenda to our children.”For more ways to combat bigotry, check out the Queer Voices newsletter."

Vance Jr.On Monday, James Harris Jackson, 28, of Baltimore was indicted Monday on one count each of first- and second-degree murder as an act of terrorism for the March 20 stabbing of Timothy Caughman, 66.He previously was charged with second-degree murder as a hate crime and three counts of criminal possession of a weapon.Vance said the hate crime charges were warranted because of the coldblooded way he chose his victim, according to a statement released to the press.“James Jackson prowled the streets of New York for three days in search of a black person to assassinate in order to launch a campaign of terrorism against our Manhattan community and the values we celebrate.Caughman was rummaging through trash looking for bottles and cans when he was fatally stabbed with a 26-inch sword.When Jackson turned himself in, about 24 hours later, police said, he told officers he came to New York from Baltimore “for the purpose of killing black men.” Jackson reportedly acknowledged the crime to the New York Daily News, saying he wanted to discourage white women from getting romantically involved with black men.“I didn’t know he was elderly,” Jackson told the paper. He added that he would have rather killed “a young thug” or “a successful older black man with blonds ... people you see in Midtown. These younger guys that put white girls on the wrong path.”Vance’s statement said a crime like this is a reminder that New York’s “remarkable diversity” can’t be taken for granted. “We must celebrate it, protect it, and refuse to let violence and hate undermine the progress we have made as a city, a state, and a nation.”Jackson’s lawyer, Sanford Talkin, declined to comment Monday, according to Newsday. His next court date is scheduled for April 13."

The statue by Kristen Visbal was originally scheduled to be removed April 2.“In her short time here, the Fearless Girl has fueled powerful conversations about women in leadership and inspired so many,” Mr. de Blasio said in a statement, to the New York Daily News. “Now, she’ll be asserting herself and affirming her strength even after her temporary permit expires — a fitting path for a girl who refuses to quit.”The extension comes after public advocate, Letitia James, and a Change.org campaign that received over 28,000 supporters, pushed for the inspirational statue to become permanent.The bronze statue of a small, ponytailed girl in windswept clothes staring down the Financial District’s iconic bull was installed the day before International Women’s Day by State Street Global Advisors as part of a campaign to get more women in corporate leadership positions. Shortly after, the “Fearless Girl” and all her hands-on-hips insolence became a tourist attraction and internet sensation.Yet, despite all the feminist rallying behind the powerful sculptor, it has gotten it fair share of criticism.Ginia Bellafante, a columnist for the New York Times noted that despite State Street promoting its statue as art that celebrates the “power of women in leadership,” there isn’t an actual woman present in the piece. There is a girl.Others believe “Fearless Girl” is nothing more than an empty publicity stunt because there is only a small percentage of women who sit on State Street’s board of directors.Out of 11 seats, only three are occupied by women, which is just 27 percent.“Three and 27 percent is better than zero,” Ann McNally, the company’s head of public relations told the Huffington Post earlier this month."

Is there anything you need from me, are you OK?’” she told People. “And Zoe kept saying, ‘Mom, would you just concentrate on having the baby!’ But I was literally trying to give birth and parent at the same time.”Since that day, McDonald has been keeping it real on Twitter about what it’s like having a baby in the household again.

The colors appear in a variety of continuously changing shapes,” NASA says. “Sometimes the aurora is so dim and scattered as to be mistaken for clouds or the Milky Way; sometimes it is bright enough to read by.”Auroras are seen during strong geomagnetic events, like when the sun sends a powerful burst of energy toward Earth, which triggers the brilliant displays in the nighttime skies, usually occurring around the magnetic poles, NASA says.The 134 passengers on the March 23 flight from New Zealand’s Dunedin Airport, cruising in a Boeing 767, had a perfect view. The following video includes images of the aurora australis taken from different vantage points inside the plane.The New Zealand charter trip to the Antarctic Circle, dubbed “Flight to the Lights,” was organized by astronomer Ian Griffin, former outreach head of NASA’s Space Telescope Science Institute.Griffin told the New Zealand Herald that the airliner crossed the International Date Line four times as it zigzagged back and forth to allow people on both sides of the aircraft to have good views of the aurora australis.Tickets for the flight were sold in pairs ― windows and adjacent seats ― and went for $2,776 for economy and $5,972 for business-class pairs.“We [didn’t] want to have issues with people fighting about who sits next to the window,” Griffin said. “The assumption was, people who buy a pair of seats will sort it out beforehand.”"

If you want to know more about individual commendations and condemnations, the New York Times did a great series of interviews in their January 29th issue.What emerges from those interviews is the stuff we instinctively know—that someone’s life has been saved; others are strapped by the premiums. Why? As you read the stories it becomes clear that it’s because annual premiums are unregulated, and it’s left to insurance companies to decide what the market will bear. The majority of negative stories come from sparsely populated towns and counties with few insurance alternatives, where companies can charge whatever they see fit. Most commercial insurers are large profit-driven corporations with boards, stockholders, and expensive CEOs; nevertheless, their pool of insureds could be dealt with more fairly and affordably. Right now it’s capitalism at its most short-sighted, benefitting one company in the short term at the expense of both its customers and the economy as a whole.Because that’s what the ACA is about—the economy.To us, it’s our individual bodies and bank accounts that are affected, but the government looks beyond our personal situation to the aggregate of how citizens affect the economy. In Cuba, this relates to socialism but—surprise, surprise—in this country it relates to capitalism. It’s about keeping working people, or would-be workers who benefit least from the economy, healthy enough to drive it forward anyway.Sick people are not productive and single mothers, or parents of sick children, tend to produce only as much as they have to in order to keep their families functional. People who can afford health insurance are generally in better-paid, white-collar jobs. People who cannot afford health insurance often work for the first group, and the reliability and quality of their labor are important. Their bosses want them to show up, perform to an agreed standard, and not spread disillusion and discontent within the workforce. It’s not Bhutan, where happiness is considered important to the nation, it’s the USA—just give us the basics and we’ll make our own happiness.America has shored up capitalism before. In the Depression of the 1930s, the vast numbers of unemployed started to become hopeless and thus politically restless. Roosevelt’s New Deal was designed to steer them away from both Socialism and Fascism. FDR put people back to work, constructing much-needed infrastructure for the nation. It was a figuratively and often literally elegant solution, providing social control in the form of a sort of romantic Modernism—an America of muscular dams, soaring bridges, and ambitious highways. Practically, it offered industries greater access to markets scattered across the vast continent.Further, Roosevelt and his cabinet knew that low-level employment was not going to be enough—some sort of guarantee was required to provide people with a feeling of stability: The Social Security Board was put in place in 1935, drastically reducing the poverty rate of older Americans, lessening the burden on working people and giving the middle classes a durable economic fix. Capitalism works! Medicare and Medicaid followed in 1965, but they were targeted programs never meant to serve the entire population.In contrast, England embraced the National Health Service as part of rebuilding the country after the physical and financial devastation of World War II. While the wealthy did not see much change in their bank balances at the end of the war, the middle and lower classes had lost a vast number of people as well as places to live—plus they had gone without a lot of necessities, including adequate food. Britain, which had managed to stay Conservative during the war without veering into Fascism, was faced with the dissatisfaction of most of its population by the end of it.In 1945, the British did not vote Winston Churchill back into office, no matter how well they thought of him as a wartime leader. A Labour government was elected and, by 1948, the National Health Service was in place. Britain needed every adult alive to be at work. Access to health care for those servicemen and women who returned from the war, as well as their families, was the most effective way to focus the nation on rebuilding its economy. Healthcare was not a stipend or a pension, rather it solved needs as they arose and thus served to bring some equality to all families. Everyone could see a doctor. From cancer to wound complications, from pregnancy to dentistry, the National Health Service pulled the poor and damaged out of a potential spiral of dwindling resources and hopelessness that could lead to strikes, political upheaval, and violence—or hardline Socialism. When the Conservatives were re-elected in the 1950s, they grumbled about the NHS, but they knew it had stabilized both the economy and the political environment to the point that they were in power once more.In contrast, “Trump/Ryancare,” now having failed twice to come to a vote on the House floor, threatened to restrict or entirely withdraw health services from tens of millions of low- and middle-income Americans, eliminate eligibility and coverage regulations for everyone else, and further extend benefits to those who can well afford to pay for them. It supposedly came with a multi-billion dollar reduction in the deficit, but with massive tax cuts for the top five percent as part of the bargain this seemed an improbable outcome. It was not a good idea.Bill Clinton’s campaign war-room slogan was “It’s the economy, stupid!” National healthcare, one form of which was pioneered by Hillary Clinton during her husband’s term, was seen as strategic.

If you want to know more about individual commendations and condemnations, the New York Times did a great series of interviews in their January 29th issue.What emerges from those interviews is the stuff we instinctively know—that someone’s life has been saved; others are strapped by the premiums. Why? As you read the stories it becomes clear that it’s because annual premiums are unregulated, and it’s left to insurance companies to decide what the market will bear. The majority of negative stories come from sparsely populated towns and counties with few insurance alternatives, where companies can charge whatever they see fit. Most commercial insurers are large profit-driven corporations with boards, stockholders, and expensive CEOs; nevertheless, their pool of insureds could be dealt with more fairly and affordably. Right now it’s capitalism at its most short-sighted, benefitting one company in the short term at the expense of both its customers and the economy as a whole.Because that’s what the ACA is about—the economy.To us, it’s our individual bodies and bank accounts that are affected, but the government looks beyond our personal situation to the aggregate of how citizens affect the economy. In Cuba, this relates to socialism but—surprise, surprise—in this country it relates to capitalism. It’s about keeping working people, or would-be workers who benefit least from the economy, healthy enough to drive it forward anyway.Sick people are not productive and single mothers, or parents of sick children, tend to produce only as much as they have to in order to keep their families functional.

Long Hansen’s",2017-03-27,"<p>With Perry Enriquez, a resident of Carville</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d0be3714000025000709b0.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In 1941, clinical trials with Promin, a sulfone drug, began with six volunteer leprosy patients at the Gillis W. Long Hansen’s Disease Center in Carville, Louisiana. Successful results were achieved a few years later, and in 1947, Promin became the “treatment of choice.” This treatment was hailed as “the miracle at Carville.” It gave hope to those affected by leprosy around the world. In this way, Carville has left its mark on the history of leprosy. I first visited Carville in 2009. The hospital had closed ten years before, but about thirteen people still lived there. That was where I met Perry Enriquez, the oldest resident at the age of 101. Even after being cured of the disease, former patients sometimes chose to stay at Carville because family ties had been cut and they had nowhere else to go. They were strongly encouraged to give up their real name and choose another to hide their identity. This was meant to spare them as well as their families the stigma of the disease. This was not a rule particular to Carville, but a common practice in many leprosy hospitals or leprosaria around the world.There is also another place that is important in the history of leprosy in the United States: Kalaupapa, a peninsula on the island of Molokai, Hawaii. The Kalaupapa settlement, surrounded by rough seas and the tallest sea cliffs in the world, was established in 1866. By 1969, a total of about 8,000 patients had lived there. Today, it has thirteen residents. In the early years, the settlement was left alone and forgotten by the outside. Those who were sent there faced a severe shortage of food and difficult living conditions. Without adequate support, they had to struggle to meet basic needs. Early on, they organized a church themselves, and with the arrival of Father Damien (1840-1889), now known as St. Damien of Molokai, conditions began to improve. Devoting himself to caring for the patients, he later contracted leprosy and died in Kalaupapa. Father Damien’s work was carried on by Mother Marianne Cope (1838-1932) who later became a respected leader of Kalaupapa.There was strong resistance to honoring Father Damien’s good works because, at the time, leprosy was misunderstood as a sexually transmitted disease and attributed to dissolute conduct. However, Robert Louis Stevenson, the Scottish author of Treasure Island and Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, visited Kalaupapa one year after Father Damien’s death, and learned of his deeds. Out of respect for his work, he defended Father Damien’s reputation.Father Damien’s name continues to be associated with work devoted to helping those affected by leprosy. In 1953, the Damien-Dutton Award was established to recognize those who have made a significant contribution to the struggle against leprosy. In 1999, the film “Molokai: The Story of Father Damien” was released and David Wenham played Father Damien.In 2009, Father Damien was canonized by Pope Benedict XVI. In the same year, President Obama signed legislation to create the Kalaupapa Memorial that will be inscribed with the names of the 8,000 people who were sent there.In 2012, Mother Marianne Cope was also canonized.This article is part HuffPost’s Project Zero campaign, a yearlong series on neglected tropical diseases and efforts to eliminate them.

Overall Pearson’s operating profit for 2016 was down about $800 million or 8 percent and the company expected it would continue to decline in 2017. In one day, Pearson’s stock plummeted 30 percent to $7 a share. In February, Reuters reported that Pearson suffered a $3.3 billion pretax loss and was deeply in debt.In the United States Pearson’s problems are escalating. In New York State the Board of Regents just voted to drop a previously mandated Pearson teacher certification test because it does not measure qualities needed to be an effective teacher. According to Kathleen Cashin, who chairs the Regent committee on higher education, “if you have a flawed test, does that raise standards or does that lower standards?” The Board of Regents is also reevaluating requirements for the edTPA, another test administered and graded by Pearson. Similar Pearson teacher certification tests are also being challenged in Florida courts by teachers and Schools of Education.In Maryland, it’s parents who are up in arms. This time it is because Pearson’s new elementary school math program is incomprehensible. At a recent local school board hearing, a third-grader testified, “My favorite subject used to be math, but now with the new math program it makes me frustrated and upset.”Pearson must be hovering over the precipice. On March 14 I received an email from Kevin Davis of its Teacher Education division asking for my help in figuring out how it could improve college textbook sales. I am not sure if Kevin realizes I am a major Pearson critic.Below are the email from Kevin and my response, plus a link to the questions Pearson asked on its “surveymonkey.” In exchange for my assistance, Kevin promised to enter me in a “drawing to win one of five $100 gift cards.” I am going to pass on the drawing!Dear Professor, We are committed to partnering with you to ensure that you have access to the best possible resources for your Teacher Education courses. At this time we are exploring opportunities for improvement of educational materials in many areas of Teacher Education. Please take the time to complete this survey and help us make important choices about product development. The survey can be found on­line here.In response I emailed Kevin.Dear Kevin,Sorry but I didn’t take your survey. I know your company is on the verge of bankruptcy and I hope you can find a new job. Please pass along to the corporate hierarchy that if Pearson would like my assistance, CEO John Fallon should first announce that Pearson is pulling out of the North American high-stakes testing market and will stop promoting private schools in the Third World.Sincerely,Alan SingerProfessor of Secondary EducationHofstra UniversityI am not sure if Kevin knows, but according to a report in the British newspaper The Telegraph, Pearson CEO John Fallon received a 20% pay raise this year despite the company’s heavy loses. Although his base salary remained the same, Fallon received a £343,000 incentive payment. That brought his total compensation for the year to £1.5 million or almost $2 million.Follow Alan Singer on Twitter: https://twitter.com/ReecesPieces8"

Since the 2009 coup d’état, the de facto regime has killed more than 120 of them.One of these activists was known better than the others, and her name was Berta Cáceres.The charismatic Lenca leader had rallied members of her community and revolutionaries across the country as part of her commitment to the Civic Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras (COPINH), a fierce popular movement that she co-founded in 1993. Over the decades that followed, Berta worked at the intersections of community organizing and global education and advocacy, even while her country was in the throes of violent political transitions and resource wars.Those issues collided forcefully on the heels of the coup, and become entangled in Agua Zarca, a dam on the Gualcarque River backed by the rightwing government and transnational capital—including the largest dam builder in the world. Berta and her comrades at COPINH knew that it would change the face of ecosystems and act as a pilot for future hydroelectric projects throughout Honduras.For them, it was a David vs. Goliath battle worth fighting. Collectively they succeeded in putting a stop to the dam’s construction—at least for now. But their victory came at a steep price.U.S.-trained elite troops stormed Berta’s home on March 3, 2016, and shot her dead. She was buried a day later on what would have been her forty-fifth birthday.News of Berta’s murder ricocheted throughout the Americas and beyond. Her story quickly became emblematic of the many rural and indigenous people putting their lives and bodies on the line in defense of territory and natural resources. And for those doing so in Honduras, the mother narrative was interwoven into the fabric of protecting the earth and honoring Berta’s legacy.Back at La Vía Campesina’s office in Tegucigalpa we were face to face with some of the finest of such activists, and preparing to meet with more in what would be a weeklong cross-country delegation commemorating Berta’s legacy exactly a year after she was killed. On the one hand, our invitation by the Honduran social movements came from their wish to have international presence during an intense time of struggle and celebration. On the other hand, their desire for us to be there came in response to our pledge to raise awareness around our government’s role in resource grabbing and political upheaval in the Honduran context.The Latin American and Caribbean region is no stranger to U.S. intervention and support of rightwing dictatorships—from the occupation of Haiti, to Pinochet’s Chile, to the contras of Nicaragua. When the army kidnapped then-President Zelaya in 2009 and flew him out of the country from the largest U.S. military base in Central America, calls came from around the world to restore democratically elected order. That never happened.Central America is equally familiar with some of the highest instances of land-grabbing in the world. Often taking the form of megaprojects—industrial food crops, agrofuel plantations, mining, big conservation, resorts, roads, and dams—indigenous and afro-descendent peoples are being stripped of their territory while local governments, transnational corporations, and the elite profit. In Honduras, the coup broke already fragile social safety nets and a new grid of power grabs took their place. Landlessness has skyrocketed.These are the new Contras, and like those that came before, they have everything to do with natural resources.Against such a backdrop, Grassroots International had chosen its ten-member delegation carefully by including activists that were already at the forefront of awareness building and funding around policy advocacy campaigns at the U.S. and international levels through their own political organizations. Each had a role to play. Among them were representatives of Cooperation Jackson, a Mississippi-based Black and Latinx working class led group dedicated to replacing the exploitative, exclusionary, and environmentally destructive economy and society, and Grassroots Global Justice Alliance, its umbrella movement that has become a leader in the contemporary fight for climate justice.Also present were young people connected to Resource Generation, an organization that works with people of wealth and class privilege who wish to equitably distribute inherited resources, as well as NoVo Foundation, one of Grassroots International’s newest institutional givers. This composition of activists is key to following through on the delegation’s commitment to its Honduran allies: getting the work done at the policy level requires a double-edged sword of root cause analysis and donors willing to speak that truth to power.In practice, that kind of political project can have many different targets at once—and each is critical. For the U.S. government, whose funding and training of the Honduran military allows it to carry out abuse and assassination, an obvious “ask” is to stop military aid. The Berta Cáceres Human Rights in Honduras Act is a congressional bill that proposes a halt to multilateral loans to Honduras. Getting it passed would represent a milestone achievement in solidarity with our Honduran sisters and brothers.For global governance mechanisms, the target is utilizing international soft law that protects rural and indigenous people from escalating land grabs. In Honduras, social movements like COPINH and Grassroots International’s partner the Black Fraternal Organization of Honduras (OFRANEH) have started focusing on Free Prior Informed Consent (FPIC) enshrined in the 169th covenant of the International Labor Organization (ILO) and subsequently, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). FPIC came out of years of struggle by indigenous peoples who warned that their lands where changing hands without their consultation or consent. When used in the spirit in which it was written, FPIC is a powerful tool: Honduras ratified the original ILO covenant and was a signatory to UNDRIP.As with many global governance instruments intended to benefit the most vulnerable, FPIC must remain within their hands. With corporate and political elite cooptation of such measures on the rise, OFRANEH organized a daylong workshop in Tegucigalpa on FPIC so that its base members would be able to be aware of such misuse. Our delegation was honored to attend these events at the invitation of OFRANEH and learn more.At the same time, transnational agrarian movements are in the process of passing a declaration on the Rights of Peasants and Other People Working in Rural Areas to extend the kinds of rights found in UNDRIP to groups of poor rural workers not covered by that particular declaration. Earlier this month, La Vía Campesina, which has been leading this process, organized a Peasants’ Rights Congress in Germany where they drafted a manifest of the urgent need for such human rights legislation.“Berta didn’t die, she multiplied,” was a repeated rallying call throughout our time in Honduras a year after her assassination. It was shouted at a demonstration in Tegucigalpa on the way to deliver legal papers to the Supreme Court. It was whispered in candlelight vigils in Berta’s home and final resting place of La Esperanza. It was sung by Garífuna activists along the Caribbean coast that identified and formed alliances with the Lenca struggle to protect their ancestral territories. The people who echoed those words were acting as guardians of Berta’s legacy, in whom her seed of resistance grows on."

TENSIONSSome scuffles broke out outside the voting center between protesters and police, who used metal barricades to keep the demonstrations well away.The activists denounced Beijing’s “interference” amid widespread reports of lobbying of voters to back Lam, rather than Tsang.Some protesters chanted “I want universal suffrage” and unfurled yellow umbrellas, a symbol of the civil disobedience “umbrella movement”, when the result was announced.“Lies, coercion, whitewash,” read one banner. A big yellow banner calling for full democracy was hung from the Lion Rock peak overlooking the city.“The central government has intervened again and again,” said Carmen Tong, a 20-year-old student. “It’s very unjust.”Hundreds of Lam’s supporters waved Chinese flags and cheered inside and outside the venue after her win.Since Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997, Beijing has gradually increased control over it even though it promised wide-ranging freedoms and autonomy not allowed on the mainland under the formula of “one country, two systems”, along with an undated promise of universal suffrage.Many, including opposition democrats, fear Lam will stick to the tough policies of staunchly pro-Beijing incumbent Leung Chun-ying, who ordered the firing of teargas on pro-democracy protesters in 2014 and who was not seen to be defending Hong Kong’s autonomy and core values.“She doesn’t have a strong foundation, nor will she have a honeymoon after she’s elected,” said political scientist Ivan Choy.“But whether she will further divide society we still have to wait and see what she does, whether she will continue the approach of Leung.”All of Hong Kong’s three other post-handover leaders have struggled to balance the demands of China’s stability-obsessed Communist Party leaders, with the wish of many residents to preserve the global financial hub’s liberal values and rule of law that have long underpinned its economic success.In 2014, parts of the city were paralyzed when tens of thousands of protesters blocked major roads for nearly three months to demand Beijing allow full democracy; demands that were ignored amid some violent clashes.China’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office congratulated Lam, saying she should not disappoint the people and should seek to “comprehensively unite all sectors of society”, strengthen development, and “work hard to forge a new situation”, the official Xinhua news agency said.Some city residents see China’s creeping interference in business, media, politics, academia and the judiciary as tarnishing the city’s international business allure.The detention in 2015 of five Hong Kong booksellers who sold material critical of Beijing also dismayed many residents.The upheavals over the city’s autonomy and democratic reforms have roiled a new generation and weighed on the city’s economy, ranked 33rd globally by the World Bank in 2015. Hong Kong’s richest man, Li Ka-shing, warned this week the city couldn’t afford another five years of strife.Hong Kong had been presented with a reform package, offering the possibility of a direct vote for this leadership race, though only of candidates essentially pre-screened by Beijing. The blueprint was vetoed in 2015 by pro-democracy lawmakers as “fake” Chinese-style democracy.Political and social divisions have led to some legislative and policy-making paralysis and the stalling of major projects, including a cultural hub and high-speed rail link to China.While Hong Kong’s proximity to China has been a boon, bringing investment and spending, businesses have also faced growing competition from mainland firms in sectors like services and property.Housing prices, now among the world’s highest, are widely seen to have been pushed up by a wave of buying from rich Chinese, intensifying anti-mainland China sentiment.(Reporting by James Pomfret, Venus Wu and Katy Wong in Hong Kong; Dominique Patton in Beijing; Editing by Robert Birsel)"

Jones cited government emails released by WikiLeaks that some people suggested contained “code words for human trafficking and/or pedophilia.”In a statement posted to his website and read Friday in a video broadcast, Jones blamed other outlets and social media sites for the “not appropriate” level of attention given to the restaurant and its owner, James Alefantis.“Neither Mr. Alefantis, nor his restaurant Comet Ping Pong, were involved in any human trafficking as was part of the theories about Pizzagate that were being written about in many media outlets and which we commented upon,” he said.Jones further conceded that his “commentaries” about the suspected scandal relied upon “third-party accounts of alleged activities and conduct at the restaurant,” as well as upon two unidentified reporters that he said “are no longer with us.”The radio host has endorsed several conspiracy theories, including claims that former President Barack Obama illegally wiretapped Donald Trump, that the U.S. government carried out the Sept. 11 terror attacks, and that the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School was a hoax.Jones’ apology came the same day that Welch, 28, pleaded guilty to a federal charge of transporting a firearm and ammunition, as well as a charge of assault with a dangerous weapon.The North Carolina man shot an AR-15 rifle two or three times when he visited the eatery in December, The Washington Post reports. He also had .38-caliber revolver with him when he entered the restaurant. Welch told The New York Times after his arrest that he was a listener of Jones’ program.Alefantis said he has continued to receive threats from people who aren’t convinced that the pedophilia ring is a hoax.On Saturday, one day after Welch entered his guilty plea, protesters outside the White House demanded a formal investigation into the rumored scandal. A similar protest was held outside Comet Ping Pong last week, Alefantis said.“Honestly I wouldn’t wish this on anyone,” he told the Times. “These lies and falsehoods spread about me and my restaurant exist all over the place. The damage that has been done to my company and business and my community, all will remain forever.” The timing of Jones’ apology suggests that he is more concerned about facing legal action than righting a wrong, The Washington Post pointed out. Jones said Alefantis wrote to him in February, demanding an apology and retraction of his broadcasts and postings on Pizzagate. Texas law dictates that Jones, who is based in Austin, had exactly one month to respond to Alefantis’ letter to avoid facing punitive damages in a libel suit. That deadline was Friday, the Post reported.Alefantis said in a statement that he was pleased with Jones’ apology and admission to having “repeatedly spread falsehoods about me and my restaurant,” but added that he wishes this action was taken months ago.A spokeswoman for Alefantis told the Post that the restaurant owner and his attorney are continuing to evaluate their legal claims."

The response left Hannity in clear disbelief, and later upset.During a back and forth on the difference between factual news and political opinion, and its impact on society, Hannity accused the former Nightline news anchor of being cynical, which he didn’t disagree with.“Do you think we’re bad for America? You think I’m bad for America?” the conservative television host asked him while wearing an American flag pin over his heart.“Yeah,” Koppel twice replied, leaving Hannity shaking his head and calling his belief “sad.”“You are selling the American people short,” Hannity added.“You have attracted people who are determined that ideology is more important than facts,” Koppel continued. Shortly after the interview aired, Hannity took to Twitter to slam his encounter with Koppel as “fake ‘edited’ news.”“I did about a 45 minute interview with CBS. They ran less than 2. Why did Ted cut out my many examples of media bias?” he tweeted.Koppel’s entire piece, which ran nearly 11 minutes, included commentary from a range of top media figures, a media expert and President Donald Trump’s press secretary, Sean Spicer. It also included Hannity sharing a belief to Koppel that “liberalism has to be defeated.”“Socialism must be defeated in a political sense. We don’t want a revolution in this country,” he said.Hannity, in statements posted to Twitter, took issue with the selected quotes that were aired.“I gave a example [sic] after example of why I say ‘journalism is dead’. I also gave many examples of how liberalism has failed,” he argued."

71,POLITICS,"Bernie Sanders, Top Progressives Announce New 'Medicare For All' Push",Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-progressives-medicare-for-all_us_58d6f5c1e4b03692bea68fd2,Lowering the Medicare age could be a starting point.,2017-03-26,Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is already planning for the aftermath of Republicans' legislative defeat with a push for single-payer health insurance.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d6fb0f14000088060718ae.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― In the wake of the Republican failure to repeal the Affordable Care Act on Friday, leading figures in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party are rallying behind a single-payer health insurance and a raft of other bold reforms.These lawmakers and grassroots leaders have long believed that the problems plaguing the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, are rooted in the original health care law’s attempt to accommodate, rather than gradually replace, the private, for-profit health insurance system.Now that efforts to eliminate the law wholesale are effectively dead, they are again arguing that the best way to improve the country’s health care system is to confront the power of corporate health care providers more directly.“We have got to have the guts to take on the insurance companies and the drug companies and move forward toward a ‘Medicare for all,’ single-payer program,” Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said on MSNBC’s “All In with Chris Hayes” on Friday night. “And I’ll be introducing legislation shortly to do that.”Sanders added on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday that he would “absolutely” seek President Donald Trump’s cooperation on expanding Medicare and lowering prescription drug prices.Even before the Republicans withdrew their Obamacare repeal bill, Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), the deputy chair of the Democratic National Committee and a close Sanders ally, previewed this message at a rally in defense of Obamacare on Thursday.“Don’t just be satisfied with defeating Trumpcare ― set your sights on creating real Medicare for all!” he told a cheering crowd of hundreds of activists. Ellison is a co-sponsor of a “Medicare for all” bill in the House.Representatives of several major progressive organizations ― the Working Families Party, the Progressive Campaign Change Committee, Credo, Social Security Works and the National Nurses United ― all echoed this push in conversations with The Huffington Post on Friday and Saturday.“The problem is the insurance companies, Big Pharma ― they’re gonna come back and use the chaos to their advantage,” predicted Social Security Works executive director Alex Lawson. “If Democrats go with a half-a-loaf policy, Republicans are going to blame them for the failures of Big Pharma. They have to immediately pivot to expanding Medicare.”During the debate over repeal, Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) used some of his time during a Budget Committee hearing to note that if Trump wanted to follow through on his campaign promise to repeal Obamacare and replace it with something “terrific,” he could fall back on an idea Trump himself endorsed in a 2000 book: single-payer. On Monday, Khanna said that now is the moment to drive the single-payer message home. “To resist Trump, we need to play offense and not just defense,” he told HuffPost.“As I pointed out in the Budget Committee hearing on Trumpcare a few weeks ago, Donald Trump supported a single payer system modeled after Canada in 2000 in his book [The America We Deserve],” Khanna went on. “He knows that is the only system that would fulfill his promise of more benefits, more coverage, and less costs. We should have every Democrat quoting Trump on a single-payer system as a mantra, and support Senator Sanders and Congressman Welch in their vision for Medicare for All, or at least, a public option. Senator Sanders is the leader of the Democratic Party currently in offering a conviction-based, affirmative vision. We should follow his direction.”Notwithstanding the support of the influential groups for the proposal and ― according to a May 2016 Gallup poll ― even a majority of the American people, Medicare-for-all legislation is a non-starter in the current Congress. Single-payer health insurance still lacks support from many, if not most, Democrats, let alone from the Republican lawmakers who control both chambers.But the proactive strategy speaks to increasing confidence among progressives that if they stick to their ideals and build a grassroots movement around them, they will ultimately move the political spectrum in their direction.“It does take time for social change,” said Chuck Idelson, communications director of National Nurses United, a 150,000-person labor union that has long advocated for a single-payer health insurance system. NNU is partnering with Justice Democrats and Brand New Congress on an online petition campaign demanding that Democrats back Medicare for all. The union is also advocating for a state level single-payer plan that is making its way through the California legislature.“We didn’t end slavery overnight,” Idelson said. “It took from Seneca Falls in 1848 ’til 1920 until women won the right to vote. But they only won it by building a movement.”The Washington Post reported Sunday that activists around the country urged their representatives over the weekend to get behind a single-payer program.In the meantime, a potential benefit of this ambitious approach is what’s known as shifting the “Overton Window” ― a political science term for the narrow range of acceptable political views at a given moment in time.By adopting a position that is considered extreme by contemporary standards, politicians and activists can make more attainable policy goals start to seem reasonable by comparison.That phenomenon already seems to be working in progressives’ favor.Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), the only one of Sanders’ Senate colleagues to endorse his presidential bid, discussed the possibility of lowering the Medicare eligibility age or empowering Medicare to negotiate drug prices in his statement on the Republican bill’s collapse.“There are plenty of ideas already on the table that would make health care more affordable for working families, from a public option, to prescription drug negotiations, to offering older Americans the chance to buy into Medicare,” Merkley said on Friday. “I’m happy to work with anyone, from either side of the aisle, to explore these or any other ideas that would improve health care for working Americans.”Lowering the Medicare eligibility age from its current level of 65 is a “very interesting” idea, because of the positive financial effect it would have on the Obamacare insurance exchanges, said Austin Frakt, a health economist for the Department of Veterans Affairs.By allowing the oldest exchange participants to enroll in Medicare, lowering the Medicare age would relieve the health insurance marketplaces of some of their costliest customers, said Frakt, who also has academic posts at Boston University and Harvard.“It would reduce the premiums in those markets,” he predicted. (Frakt noted, however, that absent measures to offset the cost of the additional beneficiaries, the change would increase Medicare’s financial burden.)Social Security Works’ Lawson praised the idea as an incremental step toward Medicare for all. “Start by lowering the age to 62 and get it down to zero,” he said.Republicans, meanwhile, believe they can score points against Democrats on the issue.“We aren’t even 3 months into the 2018 cycle and House Democrats have already begun calling for a single-payer healthcare system,” said Jesse Hunt, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, in an email to reporters Monday.“Obamacare is collapsing as a result of [its] top-down, government centered approach and the Democrats’ only answer is more government,” Hunt went on. “The question remains, how many other Democrats will join the chorus to appease the activist base of the Party that’s clamoring for far-left policies?”Another progressive policy gaining mainstream traction is legislation permitting the importation of prescription drugs from Canada, where the existing single-payer system keeps prices lower. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) was one of several Democratic senators to endure heavy criticism in January for helping block a resolution supporting drug importation. In late February, Booker became a co-sponsor of legislation Sanders introduced that would legalize prescription drug importation from Canada and other countries.Trump talked about getting tough with pharmaceutical companies over the price of prescription drugs as recently as early January.But he has remained silent on the matter since his inauguration, including the 17-day period when he was trying to pass House Republicans’ Obamacare repeal bill. What’s more, the ordeal cast serious doubt on Trump’s willingness to take on the GOP’s ultraconservatives, who no doubt would oppose any form of government intervention to reduce drug prices.Trump now claims he is counting on Democrats to negotiate over Obamacare on his terms, since, in his telling, the law is on the brink of collapse.Obamacare’s insurance exchange markets have major problems in some states and regions, but the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office characterized them as stable overall.Still, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) suggested in a CNN interview on Friday night that Democrats would be open to working with Trump and congressional Republicans on reforming the law.“We’re not gloating that they failed. We’re sad that they won’t work with us to improve Obamacare,” he said.Murshed Zaheed, political director of Credo, warned Democratic leaders that any Democratic efforts to work with Republicans would not get any help from grassroots groups like his.“If Democrats want to push their version of so-called moderate proposals ― good luck to them,” Zaheed said. “I don’t think anybody should be under any illusion that Schumer or [House Minority Leader Nancy] Pelosi will get anything from collaborating with the right-wing extremists that control Congress.”Ryan Grim contributed reporting. This story was updated Monday to include comments from Khanna and Hunt."

The club has a history of gun violence, including two shootings in 2015, City Manager Harry Black said in a statement.Authorities believe multiple gunmen were involved in the Sunday morning shooting, which grew out of “some kind of dispute” inside the bar, Police Chief Eliot Isaac said.The disagreement may have been started earlier in the day, Black said.“At this point it’s unclear exactly what instigated the shooting,” police Captain Kimberly Williams said at a televised briefing. “Just a lot of chaos when the shots went off.”Four police officers, who were providing security in the parking lot when the shots rang out, ran into the club and treated victims, the chief said. In addition to those hit by gunfire, several people sustained minor injuries attempting to flee.Police did not have a good description of the suspects, in part because witnesses were reluctant to cooperate, Williams told WCPO television.The man who was killed was identified by authorities as 27-year-old O’Bryan Spikes. Two of the injured were in critical condition, a University of Cincinnati Medical Center spokeswoman said. The others hit by gunfire were in stable condition in other area hospitals, and some were treated and released.On Sunday, former Arizona Congresswoman Gabby Giffords tweeted condolences and issued a call to action to stop “these senseless and heartbreaking shootings.” Giffords was herself the victim of a shooting spree in 2011 that killed six people and wounded 13 others. Ohio Governor John Kasich sent his condolences and offered state help in the case.“Saddened to learn about last night’s shooting in Cincinnati,” Kasich said on Twitter. “Our prayers are with the victims and families of all of those involved.”Cameo Nightlife’s Facebook page says it features “College Friday’s” for students 18 and older and “Saturday’s 21+ grown and sexy night.”The club, a large single-story structure, is a 7-mile (11 km) drive from downtown Cincinnati near the southeast corner of the city, the heart of the second largest metropolitan area in Ohio with more than 2 million residents.(Additional reporting by Melissa Fares and Barbara Goldberg in New York; Writing by Frank McGurty; Editing by Andrew Bolton and Jeffrey Benkoe)"

He will serve both sentences concurrently, The Associated Press reported.Circuit Judge Markley Dennis, in sentencing Dodson to the state’s maximum punishment for animal cruelty, said he wished the penalty could have been harder.“I’m not trying to be mean,” Dennis told Dodson, according to Charleston’s Post and Courier, “but I wish I could give you more.”The then 15-month-old Staffordshire mix named Caitlyn underwent reconstructive surgery after she was discovered in May 2015 with her swollen muzzle tightly bound with electrical tape. Her tongue, which was seen sticking out of her mouth, had turned black from a lack of blood circulation.Aldwin Roman, anti-cruelty and outreach director for the Charleston Animal Society, called Friday’s sentence “as good as we could expect.”“At the end of the day he’s going to serve 15 years in prison,” he told reporters outside the courthouse.In a video posted to the animal society’s Facebook page, Roman called the sentencing a step in the right direction.“Today was all about sending a message to our community and really across the country and across the globe that we’re not going to tolerate animal cruelty anymore. We’re going to do everything that we can within the law to get justice for victims of animal abuse,” he said while holding Caitlyn in his arms."

There are many reasons this commemoration is needed right now. The March 22 murder of Alphonza Watson in Baltimore brought to 8 the number of transwomen of color who have been killed since the start of the year, on pace to set another tragic record after 27 transgender people were murdered in 2016. The Trump administration’s rollback of protections for transgender and gender nonconforming students has increased the anxiety for many, and dramatically decreased their likelihood of getting the diplomas and degrees more easily accessible to cisgender peers. And a bright orange bus bearing banners that reinforce static, binary, and long disproven theories of biological determinism is now touring the US’s east coast, in a blatant effort to divide communities and provoke heated, even violent responses.As a Catholic and a lesbian, I am compelled to pour every ounce of my spiritual and physical energy and privilege into this weekend. And here’s why.The social justice teachings of my faith demand that institutional and civic barriers that make life more difficult for some people are unjust and must be dismantled. As transgender people and their family members whom I am privileged to meet through my work, as well as those I whom I know in my own community, tell me parts of their stories, I am overwhelmed by the significant challenges they face doing things that those of us who are cisgender do on autopilot. From basic conversations in casual encounters to purchasing items needed to function in our society to getting medical needs addressed or being able to find and maintain employment, there are numerous obstacles to living an authentic life. The psychological, spiritual, and even physical toll of constantly confronting such obstacles is exhausting, and often, debilitating. I feel especially responsible for confronting those barriers raised by my own Church, from Papal pronouncements that “gender theory” is anti-family and a threat to children to Catholic health care providers’ failure to deliver appropriate health care, whether that be refusals to use the person’s correct name or pronouns to denial of gender confirmation surgeries.The struggle of transgender/gender non-conforming people is my struggle. I came out as a lesbian in the late 1970s. At the time, people like me were almost entirely invisible. When we were seen or spoken of, it was with derision, disdain, or disgust. We had virtually no legal protections, and were considered to be sick, sinful, and criminal. We were targets of violence, even murder, by those in the social, political, and religious mainstream. I know what it’s like to have hateful words hurled at me while walking on a public street, and to be beaten by people who feel I represent something they consider a perversion of normalcy. Over the last 40 years, I’ve seen many of these marginalizing beliefs fall away, and now have the privilege of living openly in a state-sanctioned marriage to my female spouse, of being an adoptive mother, and of rarely fearing for my safety or that of my family. These changes were achieved through the advocacy, prayer, study, and risks of countless people, including many who do not identify as lesbian. It’s my turn to make the same efforts to improve conditions for the transgender community, as well as for others experiencing similar marginalization.I need to thank transgender people for expanding my cognitive and spiritual life. Like many, I grew up in an era where gender and biology were considered identical, binary, and fixed. It has been humbling and exhilarating to learn just how ignorant I was. This awareness has opened me to possibilities I could never have imagined, and has deepened my awe of the true meaning of a limitless Divine Imagination. How far beyond human thought is the Creator! I believe this openness has made me a better minister, a better person. It has given me a humility in dealing with people to know that, no matter how passionately I believe something, there’s a good chance that my knowledge is, at best, incomplete.My feeble prayers and efforts to increase justice are amplified when joined with those of others. I am but a single person and what I can accomplish is small. However, when my work and prayers are joined with those of millions of other justice-seekers from the Muslim, Jewish, Buddhist, Christian, and other faith traditions, as well as those whose moral compulsion does not rise from religious faith, our shared commitment has the real potential to result in a better world.For these reasons, I pray, I work, I recommit myself to study, conversation, and reflection about the needs and gifts of transgender people. I ask you to join me."

I’m waiting alongside Sharo, who is eight months pregnant. That morning, we’d rescued her from a dangerously overcrowded wooden boat. To save her, as well as the children and those who were sick, we’d had to leave her husband. All day, Sharo has battled labor pains and anxiety for her husband. Was he alive? Headed for a refugee processing center hundreds of miles away? For two weeks, I’ve been a volunteer on the Minden, an 80-foot former German Coast Guard ship operated by two German nongovernmental organizations, Cadus and Lifeboat Project. The Minden now carries a crew of eight – including medical staff and RIB (rigid inflatable boat) operators – to the front lines of the refugee crisis in the Mediterranean.On my very first shift, at 4 a.m., we passed the Bouri Field, a huge offshore oil and natural gas complex in the East Mediterranean just 65 miles from Libya. Its gas flare is so bright it burned like a candle in my peripheral vision for hours until sunrise. Later, I learned the flare serves as a beacon for migrants heading north to Europe. Smugglers tell them the flare is the faint glow of Italy.For the first week, we idled next to seven aid vessels from other NGOs – Sea-Eye, Sea-Watch 2, Topaz Responder, Aquarius, Golfo Azzurro, Astral, and the Iuventa – scanning the horizon. But high swells and strong onshore winds kept refugees ashore.Waiting, we practiced rescue maneuvers and monitored Channel 16 VHF, the open channel for maritime activity. But the channel remained quiet except for late-night requests by Russian trawlers and Egyptian tankers heading to Tripoli, Libya, or European Union warships enforcing the Libyan arms embargo.On clear days, through binoculars, I could make out a refinery and transmission towers on the coast. There are no landmarks to denote Libya’s territorial waters, so we steered carefully, directed by a series of red pixelated skull-and-crossbones icons on our radar. They look like something from a video game, but we had to take them seriously. In August, the Libyan Navy fired on and boarded the Bourbon Argos, operated by Doctors Without Borders, for crossing the line to help a refugee boat in distress. After a week, I began to doubt what seemed to be an excessive show of humanitarian assets. Had the migrants moved east, away from us?Then, as the weather calmed, everything changed. Over a three-day period, some 11,000 refugees tried to cross the Mediterranean, according to the Italian Coast Guard. These aren’t so much attempts to reach Europe as they are sprints past the Libyan Coast Guard – known to extort money or force rafts to return – to the loose receiving line of rescue boats waiting beyond the 12-mile territorial limit. The sheer number of rafts overwhelmed our flotilla. Tragedies mounted. Hassim, a Syrian refugee, told me that he and his family had left with seven other boats. Two days later, we’d recovered only three. The others may have drifted out of our patrol area, into the open ocean.We began to hear of deaths: a pregnant woman, a teenage girl. A man we rescued died hours later from extended exposure to toxic fumes. The next day, I joined the crew of the Astral to load 26 casualties into body bags. Amid the tragedy – so many risking so much for a chance at a safer, better life – I’m unexpectedly struck by instances of a shared humanity:Like the group of women from Ivory Coast befriend Cadisha, a mother from Mali who is partially paralyzed from a bullet lodged in her head. The women take turns caring for Dani, her 3-year-old daughter.Or the realization that on every raft, there will always be two or three people whose glances are so transparent that they emerge as leaders, helping to transform a traumatic situation into a bearable one. They maintain calm on the craft, identify the sick and dead, the pregnant and the children, and ensure that everyone has a life jacket.Or when a migrant breaks protocol, stepping uninvited onto our RIB – a cardinal rule meant to keep people from panicking – only to lay three broken men near death onto our bow, one by one, and then fall back.Or when, hours after the rest of our refugees have disembarked safely, Sharo remains aboard and still alone. Then she calls me over and gestures to an oncoming RIB from another aid ship. She whispers: “That’s him. My husband.”Note: many thanks to the German NGOs, Cadus and the Lifeboat Project, who are working on the frontline of the refugee and migrant crisis. Special thanks to the crew of the Minden."

Earl Ehrhart listens to Grace Starling testify against the bill. March 21, 2017.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d8307e2c00002400ff0810.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Georgia’s controversial House Bill 51, which would require colleges and universities to report rapes (and other felonies) to the police whether or not the survivor consents, was unanimously tabled by the state Senate Judiciary Committee last Thursday to give the legislature more time to address concerns about the measure. The measure’s sponsor, Rep. Earl Ehrhart, R-Powder Springs, however, has told the Marietta Daily Journal that “he now hopes to attach it to another piece of legislation to be considered by the Senate” this week. They further report “Should his efforts be successful, a vote on his measure could come Tuesday or Thursday.”“Rape takes an individual who is beautifully, powerfully unique and flattens her into something two-dimensional that brutal fantasy fashions into mute, pleasing paper dolls,” said Lisa Anderson, Executive Director of Atlanta Women for Equality. “That is precisely what HB 51’s mandatory reporting provision does to the extraordinary women I have the privilege of serving every day. We absolutely must put an end to this attempt to ratify rape culture.”The other key provision of HB 51 would require colleges to afford students accused of sexual assault, and other felonies, with “due process” in institutional disciplinary proceedings. This provision is in response to steps taken by the Obama Administration beginning in 2011 to step-up enforcement of and attention to long-standing requirements under federal Title IX law that educational institutions act to address student-on-student sexual harassment and assault including taking disciplinary action against students found responsible for these violations.Those requirements, however, are not at odds in anyway with ensuring accused students at state institutions receive “due process”. The U.S. Supreme Court established precedent on 14th Amendment due process protections in 1976’s Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 US 319, and since then courts have consistently applied them to state colleges and universities in student conduct proceedings. These basic protections include the right to notice of accusations against them, a right to be heard, and depending upon the circumstances procedural safeguards like the opportunity to be presented with evidence against them. No act of Congress, such as Title IX, or guidance documents concerning such a law can override these Constitutionally guaranteed protections.The key is to balance the rights of the accused with those of the accuser. None of the iterations of House Bill 51, later versions of which provided greater protections for sexual assault survivors after intense lobbying from student activists, seem designed to find this balance, rather they appear to favor the rights of the accused at the expense of the rights and well-being of the survivor.“To a rape victim in Georgia this will always symbolize someone who is accused being preferred over someone who was raped,” law student Grace Starling, herself a survivor and one of the organizers of Students Against House Bill 51, said in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. “You cannot come at a piece of legislation one sided, and then say it is finally balanced so it is OK now.”Rather than trying to rush this measure through this year, I encourage the legislature to come back next year and take a much more thorough and balanced look at these issues in the interests of protecting all students on Georgia’s campuses."

It’s one thing to get a little dust in your eye that takes your vision out of focus. Now imagine this kind of dust problem on a galactic scale where it hinders scientists trying to focus their telescopes into space.That’s part of the challenge faced by researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, reports Space.com. They’re creating an instrument that will offer specific information on how fast the universe is growing.This device ― the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument ― will create a map of over 30 million galaxies. But in order for that map to be precise, astronomers will have to correct for the problems created by all the dust particles in the Milky Way galaxy that impede their deep space investigations.“Because outer space is a very dusty place, that makes things very difficult for astronomers and astrophysicists who are trying to peer farther across the universe or deep into the center of our own galaxy to learn more about their structure, formation and evolution,” according to a Berkeley Lab statement.To help with the DESI project, Berkeley researchers created the following detailed 3D animation showing dust that spans thousands of light-years in our home galaxy. The study was published this week in The Astrophysical Journal. Here’s the animation:“The light from those distant galaxies travels for billions of years before we see it,” said Edward F. Schlafly in the Berkeley Lab statement. “But in the last thousand years of its journey toward us, a few percent of that light is absorbed and scattered by dust in our own galaxy. We need to correct for that.”Schlafly and his team created the 3D map (seen above) fly-through of the Milky Way by using data composed of separate sky surveys from telescopes on Maui and in New Mexico, resulting in 3D dust maps “many times better than anything that previously existed,” Schlafly said. The Berkeley scientists are looking to create higher quality dust maps which will, in turn, provide them with improved details about space dust properties.“This can give us a much more precise gauge of distances to faraway stars in the Milky Way, like a galactic GPS,” they said."

Hosted by Reynolds’ son and Fisher’s brother, Todd Fisher, the event ― or show, according to Todd, since “my mother didn’t like memorials and funerals” ― was held at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Los Angeles. Attendees included actors Griffin Dunne, Ruta Lee and Dan Aykroyd, who told a sweet story about his former fiancée Carrie, calling her a “beloved showboat.”According to The Hollywood Reporter, the 90-minute ceremony also featured montages, set to music by “Star Wars” composer John Williams, highlighting Reynolds’ and Fisher’s careers, intimate family photos, interviews and humanitarian work. There was even a memorable “beepy” appearance by R2-D2 and performances by the Gay Men’s Chorus of Los Angeles and tap dancers from Debbie Reynolds Dance Studios. And, although he wasn’t present, “I’m Here to Let You Go,” an original song by Fisher’s close friend James Blunt, made its debut during a photo montage. Fisher died on Dec. 27 at the age of 60 following a heart attack. The next day, her beloved mother Reynolds died at 84. “When Carrie died, my mother decided to change her plans a bit,” Todd told the audience at the memorial. “My mother always said to me, ‘I never want to go to my daughter’s funeral service. I would like to be buried with Carrie.’ I didn’t know she was going to leave us that very next day and when she looked at me to ask permission to leave, she said she wanted to be with Carrie, and she closed her eyes and went to sleep.
