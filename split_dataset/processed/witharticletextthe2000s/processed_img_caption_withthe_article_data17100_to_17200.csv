1,WORLD NEWS,El Salvador Upholds Three-Decade Prison Term For Woman Who Suffered Stillbirth,Jesselyn Cook,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/el-salvador-stillbirth-case_us_5a32ab02e4b00dbbcb5ba9e7,Teodora Vasquez has already spent 10 years in jail after having pregnancy complications.,2017-12-14,Teodora Vasquez waits in a courtroom in San Salvador on Dec. 8.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a32f5a01600000f12cf14b1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A Salvadoran court upheld a 30-year jail sentence this week for a woman who was convicted of aggravated homicide after suffering what she said was a stillbirth.Teodora Vasquez, 34, has already spent 10 years in prison over the death of her child. Her case is a painful reminder of the injustices women face under El Salvador’s draconian abortion laws, Amnesty International said Thursday, one day after Vasquez’s appeal was rejected. “Teodora’s tragic story is a sad illustration of everything that is wrong with the justice system in El Salvador, where human rights seem to be a foreign concept,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Amnesty’s Americas director. “Instead of punishing Teodora for being a woman, authorities in El Salvador must urgently take a hard look at their outrageous anti-abortion law and take immediate steps to repeal it.”Vasquez reportedly experienced intense pain while at work in 2007, and called for an ambulance before fainting. She awoke in a pool of blood, surrounded by police officers, who were arresting her for aborting her baby. She was convicted the following year.“The room was in tears when we heard the verdict,” said Amnesty’s El Salvador representative, Ina Strøm, who was in the courtroom. “The family is devastated. This is such a tragedy and the injustice is beyond words.”Enacted in 1998, El Salvador’s total ban on abortion is among the strictest in the world. It does not exclude victims of rape or incest, or women whose lives are endangered by their pregnancies. Girls as young as 10 have been forced to become mothers. Those like Vasquez, who have miscarriages or stillbirths, are regularly prosecuted and sentenced to spend decades behind bars.El Salvador is one of six countries worldwide where abortion is outlawed without exception.Abortion carries a sentence of up to eight years in prison, but authorities can change the charge to aggravated homicide in cases where a fetus or newborn dies, according to the BBC. That charge carries a minimum of sentence of 30 years.Vazquez is among 27 women who are currently imprisoned for abortion-related crimes after suffering miscarriages, stillbirths or pregnancy complications, Reuters reported, citing the Citizen Group for the Decriminalisation of Abortion, a Salvadoran rights group.In July, Salvadoran prosecutors sentenced Evelyn Beatriz Hernandez Cruz to 30 years in jail for committing aggravated homicide. The teenage rape survivor didn’t even know she was pregnant at the time of her miscarriage in April 2016.The country’s criminalization of abortion has led many desperate women to seek out dangerous alternatives, a 2014 Amnesty investigation noted, including clandestine operations. Others have committed suicide.The ban has also caused Salvadoran women to decline proper medical care when issues arise with their pregnancies, out of fear that their doctors will report them to authorities, as they are legally required to do.“I was [bleeding] for just over two weeks. And I started to feel a little panicky because it was increasing. I was really afraid, because of all that going to see a doctor implied. The doctors have the power. The power to say: ‘I support you or I report you,’” one woman told Amnesty in 2013. “I was really, really afraid.”As the Guardian reported, U.S.-based anti-abortion group Human Life International has been quietly providing funds to Sí a la Vida, a major Salvadoran advocate of the abortion ban, since 2000. Referring to the country’s anti-abortion stance in 2006, HLI’s then-president Rev. Thomas Euteneuer told the New York Times Magazine: “El Salvador is an inspiration.”"

Blake Farenthold (R-Texas), told CNN that Farenthold’s staffers were subjected to verbal abuse and sexually explicit remarks from the lawmaker.In one instance in July 2015, said Rekola, who was then Farenthold’s communications director and was about to get married, the lawmaker told him: “Better have your fiancee blow you before she walks down the aisle ― it will be the last time.” Farenthold allegedly went on to ask Rekola, in front of other staffers, if his fiancee could wear white on the wedding day, apparently referring to whether she was a virgin.Rekola told CNN that Farenthold regularly had angry outbursts, screaming and slamming his fists on desks, and would call aides “fucktards.” Farenthold often made comments about women’s physical features, including their breasts or behinds, Rekola said.Farenthold’s office did not immediately reply to HuffPost’s request for comment. In a statement to CNN, Farenthold denied verbally abusing his staff or making inappropriate comments to Rekola about his then-fiancee. He said he did refer to aides as “fucktards” ― but said it was a joke.Earlier this month, Politico reported that Farenthold had used $84,000 in taxpayer funds to settle a 2014 sexual harassment lawsuit. In a statement at the time, Farenthold denied any wrongdoing.Last week, in the wake of Politico’s report, the House Ethics Committee announced an investigation into the harassment claim and settlement payment.Rekola told CNN he has approached the committee to share his own account.Women in various industries and institutions, including in politics, have been speaking out against sexual misconduct as part of the #MeToo movement. Last month at a congressional hearing, several female lawmakers testified about instances of sexual harassment involving other members of Congress and staff. Several lawmakers have recently resigned in response to allegations of sexual misconduct, including Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) and Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.). At least two Republican congresswomen have called on Farenthold to resign."

5,POLITICS,Kentucky Lawmaker And Self-Styled ‘Pope’ Kills Himself Amid Sexual Assault Investigation,Dominique Mosbergen,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dan-johnson-kentucky-suicide_us_5a31e98be4b07ff75b003089,Rep. Dan Johnson had been accused of sexually abusing a 17-year-old friend of his daughter in 2012.,2017-12-14,"Kentucky state Rep. Dan Johnson, a Republican, was found dead Wednesday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a31f66c1600002100c4fdb9.jpeg?cache=g06frSfibC&ops=crop_59_450_2384_2387%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Three days after the publication of an investigative report accusing Kentucky Rep. Dan Johnson of crimes and misconduct including the sexual assault of a then-teenager, the 57-year-old lawmaker from Bullitt County was found dead near a bridge in Mount Washington on Wednesday. The coroner has ruled his death a probable suicide. A gun was reportedly recovered near his body.On Wednesday afternoon, Johnson, a self-anointed “pope” of the nondenominational Heart of Fire Church, reiterated his denial of the allegations in a Facebook post and told his family members to “stay strong.”“Heaven is my home,” he wrote.The Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting (KyCIR) had published an expansive report on Monday accusing the Republican state representative of molesting a young woman, committing arson and lying to his congregation and constituents about his achievements.Maranda Richmond, now 21, told KyCIR that Johnson, who’d been her pastor and a close family friend, sexually abused her in 2012 when she was 17. She said she’d been spending the night with Johnson’s daughter when the pastor, apparently intoxicated, returned home and groped her breasts while she was sleeping on a sofa.“He stuck his tongue in her mouth. Then, he forced his hands down her pants, underneath her underwear, and penetrated her with his finger,” the report said.Richmond later reported the incident to police, but investigators closed the case months later without interviewing Johnson. In the aftermath of the KyCIR report, the Louisville Metro Police Department said this week that detectives had reopened the investigation.The Kentucky Capitol reverberated with calls for Johnson’s resignation this week. Mary Nishimuta, executive director of the Kentucky Democratic Party, had urged Johnson to step down immediately. Mac Brown, chairman of the Kentucky’s Republican Party, echoed this sentiment in a Monday statement.“Following today’s extensively sourced and documented story from the Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting, we once again find ourselves in a position where we must call for him to resign, this time, from the Kentucky General Assembly,” Brown said.Johnson, who narrowly defeated Democratic incumbent Linda Belcher in an election last year, had been asked to resign from his seat before for posting racist content on his Facebook page, including images depicting former President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama as monkeys. At a news conference Tuesday, Johnson vehemently denied the claim of sexual assault and said he would not resign.“This allegation concerning this lady, this young girl, absolutely has no merit. These are unfounded accusations, totally,” he said, later suggesting that the accusations were politically motivated. There are seasons of accusations in politics, Johnson said, according to the Louisville Courier-Journal. And this current “season” involves allegations of sexual assault.“If that’s the case, Frankfort may have a bunch of empty seats if it runs off of just accusations,” Johnson said. “It would be a hard place to fill the seats in the Senate, House and anywhere else.”The Kentucky Capitol has recently been mired in controversy as allegations of sexual harassment have been leveled against multiple lawmakers. On Sunday, Republican Speaker of the House Jeff Hoover resigned his post amid accusations of sexual misconduct against him and three other Kentucky GOP lawmakers. Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin had called for all lawmakers accused of sexual harassment to resign. On Wednesday, Bevin wrote that he was “saddened” to learn of Johnson’s death. “These are heavy days in Frankfort and America,” he wrote.Louisville Public Media, the parent company of KyCIR, said in a statement that it was “deeply” saddened to hear of Johnson’s death.“All of us at Louisville Public Media are deeply sad to hear that State Representative Dan Johnson has died, apparently of suicide,” said the company’s president, Michael Skoler, according to the Courier-Journal. “As part of the process, we reached out to Representative Johnson numerous times over the course of a seven-month investigation. He declined requests to talk about our findings.”If you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

6,RELIGION,More People Are Celebrating Christmas Without Religion,Carol Kuruvilla,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/christmas-without-religion_us_5a3299b3e4b0bb42ac170ca9,From holy night to holly jolly Christmas.,2017-12-14,"A Nativity scene and Christmas trees are seen during a preview of holiday decorations in the East Room of the White House, Nov. 27, 2017",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a32bf271600000f12cf13e9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"More Americans are embracing the holly, jolly, cultural parts of Christmas and shedding the holy and religious aspects.While Christmas remains as popular as it has been in past years, a Pew Research Center survey released Tuesday suggests the way Americans celebrate the holiday is slowly shifting toward the secular. Researchers found that a growing number of U.S. adults believe the religious parts of Christmas are being emphasized less in American society ― and many aren’t bothered by the change. In addition, the number of people who believe in key aspects of the Christmas story ― such as the virgin birth and the wise men bringing Jesus gifts ― is declining. Significantly, even a small percentage of self-professed Christians are doubting these biblical narratives.Pew found that 46 percent of adults surveyed this year said they see Christmas as more of a religious holiday than a cultural holiday, down from 51 percent in 2013. Most Millennials who celebrate Christmas think of it more as a cultural holiday than a religious one (44 percent, compared with 32 percent).Tom Krattenmaker, who writes about religion in public life and authored Confessions of a Secular Jesus Follower, told HuffPost that the poll findings may reflect the growing number of Americans who are religiously unaffiliated.“As more Americans drift away from religion in general and Christianity in particular, it stands to reason they would take a more secular approach to the holiday,” Krattenmaker said.One of the most striking parts of the survey explored how Americans feel about the story of Jesus’ birth as it is described in the Bible. Pew found that most Americans still believe in key elements of this biblical narrative ― that Jesus was born to a virgin (66 percent), that he was laid in a manger (75 percent), that wise men, guided by a star, brought Jesus gifts (68 percent), and that an angel announced Jesus’ birth to shepherds (67 percent). But the share of people who profess belief in these biblical events is declining. In 2014, 65 percent of Americans believed all four of these elements. This year, 57 percent said the same. Some of this decline can be explained by the increasing number of Americans who are religiously unaffiliated. But there’s also been a small shift within Christianity itself. Researchers found that the number of Christians who believe in all four elements declined from 81 percent in 2014 to 76 percent this year. White mainline Protestants were particularly doubtful about these stories. For example, the number of white mainline Protestants who believed in the virgin birth dipped from 83 percent in 2014 to 71 percent in 2017. Mike McHargue is a Christian author and podcaster whose work often touches on the topic of doubt within Christianity. McHargue told HuffPost that he finds the shift within Christianity was both inevitable and encouraging. For him, it means that people are stepping away from thinking of the elements of the Christmas story as scientific facts ― which is not how Jesus’ followers in the first century would have understood them anyway.“Both Protestants and atheists share the same basic modernist frame to interpret religious claims,” McHargue said. “Though they come to oppositional conclusions, both elevate reason as the primary means of discerning truth. That’s a great way to make iPhones and spacecraft, but a weak way of illuminating the experiential part of humanity’s consciousness.” Instead of obsessing over details of the Christmas story, McHargue said people should be asking different questions ― why did the gospel writers tell the story in this way, who were they writing for, and what does all of this reveal about humanity’s search for meaning in the 21st century?“In that way, it encourages me that people can let go of such vigorously defended ideas and still identify as Christians,” McHargue said. “It means they’ve found something more powerful in the story of Jesus than a set of facts or a first-century mythology.”While conservative media outlets ― and President Donald Trump himself ― have focused much energy on fighting what they claim is a “War on Christmas,” many Americans don’t seem to be worried about this cultural shift. Even though most Americans (56 percent) said the religious aspects of Christmas are emphasized less today than in the past, few (25 percent) are bothered by the change.More than half of Americans (52 percent) said it “doesn’t matter” whether stores greet customers with “Merry Christmas” or “Happy Holidays” during the festive season. And fewer Americans now say Christian displays should be allowed on government property without representation from other religions. In 2014, 44 percent said symbols like nativity scenes should be allowed on government property even if unaccompanied by symbols from other faiths. That declined to 37 percent this year. On the other hand, a growing number of people said no religious displays should be permitted on government property (20 percent in 2014, compared with 26 percent in 2017.)The holiday remains widely popular. Nine of 10 Americans said they celebrate Christmas, nearly the same as in 2013. Many still plan to gather with friends and family on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day (82 percent). And about half plan to attend church services on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day, a percentage similar to the 2013 responses.Krattenmaker said he’s glad Americans aren’t abandoning the holiday. “Christmas can be fun and meaningful, even if you aren’t religious,” he said.The Pew Research Center surveyed 1,503 adults between Nov. 29 and Dec. 4, this year using live telephone interviewers to reach both landlines and cellphones."

Ahead of Thursday’s successful vote to repeal the Obama-era rules protecting net neutrality, the FCC’s two dissenting commissioners ― Mignon Clyburn and Jessica Rosenworcel ― released their full statements on why they vehemently oppose Chairman Ajit Pai’s proposal to end the 2015 policy, which banned internet service providers from offering faster speeds and access to websites that pay them more.Clyburn and Rosenworcel, the only two women on the commission, go into great detail in their lengthy statements describing what they believe Americans’ internet access will be like without net neutrality.Here is an excerpt from Clyburn’s statement, which describes how the end of net neutrality will especially hurt low-income Americans and people of color:Many have asked, what happens next? How will all of this – Net Neutrality, my internet experience, look after today? My answer is simple. When the current protections are abandoned, and the rules that have been officially in place since 2015 are repealed, we will have a Cheshire cat version of net neutrality. We will be in a world where regulatory substance fades to black, and all that is left is a broadband provider’s toothy grin and those oh so comforting words: we have every incentive to do the right thing. What they will soon have, is every incentive to do their own thing.And here is an excerpt from Rosenworcel’s:We’re told don’t worry, competition will save us. But the FCC’s own data show that our broadband markets are not competitive. Half of the households in this country have no choice of broadband provider. So if your broadband provider is blocking websites, you have no recourse. You have nowhere to go.Both their statements are worth a read in their entirety. You can read Clyburn’s here and Rosenworcel’s here."

Gerber recently revealed on MSNBC’s “Headliners” show that the actor once gifted 14 of his closest friends a $1 million a few years ago. “There’s a group of guys we call ‘The Boys,’” Gerber said. “George had called me and ‘The Boys’ and said, ’Hey, mark Sept. 27th, 2013, on your calendar. Everyone’s going to come to my house for dinner.”Once everyone was gathered at Clooney’s house, he gave each of “The Boys” a black bag. It almost sounds like a scene out of “Oceans Eleven.” “George begins to say, ‘Listen, I want you guys to know how much you’ve meant to me and how much you mean to me in my life,’” Gerber said. ”‘I came to L.A., I slept on your couch. I’m so fortunate in my life to have all of you and I couldn’t be where I am today without all of you. So, it was really important to me that while we’re still all here together, that I give back. So I want you all to open your suitcases.’” When the group opened their suitcases, all of them found $1 million broken down into $20 bills. Clooney said that he’d also paid taxes on all the gifts, and Gerber said his friends were simply “in shock.” “One was working at a bar in Texas at the airport, trying just to support his family,” Gerber said. “Rides a bicycle to work every day. I mean, these are guys that took care of George and now he’s giving it all back.” Gerber says he tried returning his money to Clooney, but the actor wasn’t having it. “I pull him aside and said, ‘I absolutely am not taking this million dollars,’” he recalled. “Immediately George goes, ’I’m just going to make one announcement. If Rande doesn’t take the million dollars, nobody gets” their money. Now that’s one way to bargain. Gerber said he gave his gift to charity. And the universe found a way to give something back to Clooney a year later. “This is who George is. That was Sept. 27, 2013. Now Sept. 27, 2014, he marries Amal,” Gerber said. “That’s good karma right there.”"

Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska).,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a31d77e1600004700c4fd79.jpeg?cache=g33PruP3V0&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Fresh off an inspiring Democratic win in Alabama’s Senate race, hundreds of progressive activists, many of whom had physical disabilities, converged on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to protest the Republican tax bill.Eighty-four of them were arrested after refusing Capitol Police requests to move from public spaces, the police agency said. The demonstrators, mobilized by an array of progressive groups, focused their efforts on Republican senators who had expressed doubts about the legislation or the process that created it: Sens. Susan Collins (Maine), Jeff Flake (Ariz.), John McCain (Ariz.) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska). Although Democrat Doug Jones, the victor in Tuesday’s special election for an open Senate seat, will likely not be seated before the tax bill is voted on, several activists said that Jones’ win was a sign that the public is on their side in the fight. “What we saw in Alabama was more than just the rejection of a pedophile,” said Social Security Works Executive Director Alex Lawson, referring to accusations against Jones’ Republican rival, “it was a rejection of the entire Republican agenda to ... rob us of our health care, to raid Medicare and destroy Medicaid, all so some Wall Street parasite can buy yet another yacht. Dozens of brave Americans got arrested in Senate offices today to make it clear that we fight back and we never give up.”The demonstrators on Wednesday, which included activists affiliated with Social Security Works, the Center for Popular Democracy, Housing Works, the Women’s March, the Strong Economy for All Coalition and Hedge Clippers, focused on the anticipated reductions to social programs that would result from the tax legislation.The tax bill is due to add $1 trillion to the debt, which would trigger so-called “paygo” rules resulting in across-the-board spending cuts that would affect programs like Medicare. Republican leaders in Congress have committed to waiving paygo, but activists are not satisfied that they will follow through once the tax bill passes. The activist groups also noted that the money the bill would add to the debt is likely to generate pressure to reduce budget deficits at the expense of vulnerable populations.House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and other GOP lawmakers have already announced that cutting so-called entitlements for seniors and people with disabilities ― Social Security and Medicare ― as well as means-tested programs like food stamps are next on their agenda.Ady Barkan, a 33-year-old organizer at the Center for Popular Democracy, made national waves last Thursday when he confronted Flake during a flight they were both on about the ramifications of the tax bill for people who rely on government benefits. Barkan, who was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig’s disease, or ALS, just over a year ago, worries that cuts to programs like Medicare would negatively affect his life when his disease forces him to seek public assistance. In an emotional exchange with Flake, he told the senator that a vote against the bill “could save my life.” The conversation took place two days after Barkan was arrested protesting the tax bill outside the office of Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), who Barkan noted is the wealthiest member of Congress.In one last bid to stop the legislation, Barkan flew once again from his home in Santa Barbara, California, to demonstrate on Capitol Hill on Wednesday ― this time with the support of his wife and 18-month-old toddler. McCain and Murkowski did not agree to his request for a meeting; Flake was unable to meet with Barkan because he had to vote on legislation. But Barkan was able to meet with Collins alongside a delegation of activists from Maine.In a meeting with Collins that was broadcast on Facebook live, Barkan and his comrades pushed Collins on why she would agree to vote for the tax bill without insisting on a provision precluding across-the-board paygo cuts beforehand.Rather than lock in the waiving of paygo before committing to support the tax bill, Collins said, “I have to have it be passed into law by the end of the year is the agreement.”Barkan and the other activists argued that Republican leaders could break their promise, much as they did the promises to hold the middle class harmless in the tax cut bill and not add to budget deficits. (Reductions in tax deductions, including the state and local tax deduction, mean that the bill is a net tax increase for millions of middle-class households.)“I believe the commitments that I’ve received,” Collins responded when challenged.“I know, but it’s my life on the line!” Barkan declared.Collins refused to argue that agreeing to vote for the bill before her condition is met amounted to giving up her leverage.“I used my leverage to negotiate promises to me,” Collins said. ”I know the vehicle that it’s going to be put in.”“It’s not enough. You have to vote no,” Barkan replied.Wednesday’s protests were the last of several days of civil disobedience in recent weeks. Last Tuesday, Barkan was one of 133 demonstrators arrested outside House offices, and the day before that there were 23 arrests.But neither the public uproar nor an impending reduction in the GOP majority after the Democratic win in Alabama was enough to stop the speeding train that is the Republican tax legislation. Shortly before the arrests, President Donald Trump announced that House and Senate leaders had agreed to a final tax bill reconciling their differences between versions passed in each chamber. Congress would pass the legislation and the president would sign it before Christmas, Trump said ― just in time to affect paychecks beginning in February.The protests were not in vain, though, according to Lawson of Social Security Works.“The only way we lose is if we forget what we are fighting for. Anything else is a temporary setback,” he concluded. “These protests are a testament that we will never forget and will always keep fighting to build a future for all of us, not just a handful of billionaires.”"

In January, the big-screen adaptation of “Marjorie Prime” premiered at Sundance; Smith’s performance has since sparked Oscar buzz, collecting nominations from the Gotham Awards and the Independent Spirit Awards. Smith originated the role onstage, in Jordan Harrison’s Pulitzer-nominated play about an octogenarian conjuring memories from her life in the company of her late husband, who assumes the form of a computer-programmed hologram. The movie “Marjorie Prime” opened in August. Then, Smith appeared in November’s “Lady Bird,” the acclaimed Greta Gerwig film that’s another awards season favorite. For a venerated actress who has consistently worked without achieving widespread fame, Smith’s 2017 has been an improbable treat. It’s one of precious few examples of aging performers earning their due. HuffPost sat down with Smith in New York on the afternoon of last month’s Gotham Awards. If she earns an Oscar nomination on Jan. 23, she’ll be among the oldest nominees in the award’s 90-year history. What does she think of all this fuss? She’s grateful, of course, but she could do without it, too.It seems you’ve had a huge year. Does it feel that way to you?Oh my gosh, it’s been wild. This past year has been very quiet for me, actually, in a certain way. I was recovering from [her partner, actor David Margulies’] death, which happened a year ago last January. It’s getting into almost two years now.But the year just before this very year was so busy. The first time I did “Marjorie Prime” was the fall of 2014, and after that, I did a play at [Steppenwolf Theatre in Chicago] that Rory Kinnear had written, his first play, and directly back to New York and pretty straight into Annie Baker’s play “John” [at Signature Theatre Company in August 2015]. And right after that was the filming of “Marjorie Prime,” and right after that — I mean, really, hours — into the first rehearsal of “Marjorie Prime” onstage at Playwrights Horizons.And then it was January of 2016. That year, I turned down all the roles that came for the stage. Nothing I was really into. But I started doing quite a lot of guest shots in episodic series. It’s all been really overwhelming, really it has been.I’m not working [now]. Well, I’m doing television stuck in among the other things, briefly. I’ve got plays coming up, but not until spring.Do you prefer to stay in New York?I do. I love to be at home. I really do.Was there a point in your career when you became choosier about the roles that required travel?Well, for quite a while I was a single mother with a growing child, and I thought, I can’t really take long trips, and I also don’t want to. It’s a good excuse.And then later, there were good times, onstage and on film, of going out of town. I haven’t done a lot of classics, though. I’ve done almost no Shakespeare, I’m sorry to say, but I did get to do some Chekhov and Shaw. Irene Lewis was so great — the first time I worked at the Baltimore Center Stage, when she was the artistic director, I did a modern George Walker play, and she asked me if there’s anything I wanted to do. At that time, I knew I wanted to do “The Cherry Orchard,” and we did a beautiful production. And then I said, “When I was a student, I always thought I’d do Shaw, and I never had.” And she did “Mrs. Warren’s Profession” for me, so that was a treat.I always say it’s the people or the material, and when the people and the material were very attractive, there’s no reason I couldn’t do the plays.Is there a Shakespeare role that you’d love to get your hands on?You know, it’s a little late now for my favorites. There might still be something.You could kick “Macbeth” up a couple of generations and do an older Lady Macbeth, right?[Laughs.] We’ll see.The list of people you’ve worked with is astonishing: John Cassavetes, James Stewart, Helen Hayes, James Dean, Jack Nicholson — all before 1980.Isn’t that amazing? As it happens, it just happens. You know, James Dean was not an icon. He was a very talented, fascinating young actor doing his first movie. Certainly, some of it has been sort of astonishing, but it’s never like ― gasp! I’ve been most greatly fortunate, and sometimes very fortunate to have something drop in my lap, like working with James Stewart on a television show. That was just a funny thing — I don’t know how it happened. Somebody in the big television casting stuff must have noticed that I was one of the young actresses who had started to work. But it was never a big pursuit. I just kept working. I’ve been very fortunate to do that.Did James Stewart have a big movie-star aura?No, no. Most people are lovely, really.“Marjorie Prime” has consumed such a large portion of your life.It’s been well over four years since I was first handed “Marjorie Prime” to play. I’ve been living with it a long time.It does seem like your profile has risen in conjunction with this role. Audiences get to discover the same role across stage and screen.It’s interesting. When you just said stage and screen are coming together, that’s true, really, because I don’t think that’s ever happened before for me, and it doesn’t happen very often that people play something on the stage and get to make a film of it.Now, when I did it onstage, I did it at the Taper in LA, and at the Playwrights Horizon. These are places where I’ve done regional theater, and the New York scene of theater companies where I have worked for a long time. So that was not a new audience for me. It was wonderful to bring this wonderful play to these audiences, I certainly feel that. And in film, again, I’ve been doing films for 60 years, but this one was really special. It’s special on its own terms.Some critics have called it the greatest role of your career.I don’t even know how to think about that. Whenever people ask you something like that, you know — the answer to the what’s-your-favorite question is, “The last one.” Because what are you going to do? It’s very hard. There are many meaningful things for different reasons, and especially once you’ve been at it as long as I have.What were your first ideas about the play, which addresses concepts of memory and death?The minute I read it, I was so excited. [...] I’ve always found [Marjorie Prime] the most full-of-life character. The play is funnier, and the movie is sadder. It has partly to do with the adaptation and partly to do with the tonality of the two different people who made them. It’s the same story, but of course, there are differences with the movie. The play takes place in one room, and I was mostly sitting in a reclining chair all evening. That’s a big difference, but the character remains very much the same.When you first saw the movie, were you prepared for that tonal difference?It took me quite a while to accept the movie entirely as itself because I couldn’t help it. I’d been living with this text for a long time. I’d read the screenplay [by Michael Almereyda], and of course, admired it from the beginning. And I think I increasingly appreciate many things about it.I think Michael did many wonderful things to make this a movie, because it’s not a simple, obvious thing to do when it’s very contained, with few characters in one place. It’s very verbal, and it’s very thoughtful and provocative — all things I love.And of course, you do a play and you don’t see yourself. And actually, when you do a film you can see yourself, and that is not always easy, either. Maybe because I’m a stage actress so much, I’m not used to seeing myself act. It’s true I’ve been doing it for a long time, but it is different. It’s not something that happens to you in a play.And I must say, I think when I first see myself in something, more often than not, it’s difficult. It’s not the most fun, to judge one’s own performance. We often are not very good at it as actors. I know a lot of other actors have that trouble, too. Some have it worse than I do.Do you ever go back and watch your older work?Rarely, though once in a while something comes up, like “East of Eden.” Quite a number of years ago now, it had some big anniversary, so there were a lot of events. That was an occasion for seeing it again.What did you think upon revisiting it?Oh, I loved it. It’s better if it’s long ago. And also, it’s really interesting — I remember a film I made with Paul Mazursky many years ago, “Next Stop, Greenwich Village.” It was a film that, for some reason — I think it had to do with a piece of music — was never on television, and people didn’t see it. And I hadn’t seen it or thought about it, really. But that must have gotten fixed, because it was on television.I happened onto it, and in that case, it was like, “Oh my god, how young we all were,” because it was this circle of New York actors. We were so young! Chris Walken is in it, and Jeff Goldblum and Ellen Greene. That was like visiting another time, because it really was of its time.Acting is maybe the only profession that provides a living yearbook to open, or not, at your choosing.It’s true, isn’t it? You don’t have to go looking for it sometimes — it just appears.Do you feel you’re fundamentally a stage actress?I guess I do. It’s where I started. I was really lucky when I first came to New York and started working. Within the first couple of years, I was working both onstage and in television, of which there was lots then, in the ’50s. I mean, lots. There were plays on television — not series, but every week, plays. Right away, I started to do plays for television and film. That was really lucky, in so many ways.Do you feel like you’ve managed to accomplish onscreen what you would want to, given that theater and the stage are your bread and butter?Well, you don’t get much bread and butter in the theater. Really, film and television is where the bread and butter is, in terms of making a living.But had I been a more famous movie person, I might have had better parts. I think I had some lovely parts. I’m not complaining about them. But I never felt I was a movie star.When American Cinematheque in LA announced they were going to do a retrospective — three days of double features of films of mine — my immediate response was, “Well, that doesn’t make any sense. I’m not a movie star. Who would come to that?” And after friends and family told me, “No, this is really nice,” I thought, “Oh yeah.” And it was! It was really nice. And now The Quad is going to do something like that in New York. I guess that also gave me the feeling, “Well, yeah! I did some interesting things in movies.”I’ve always felt, as much as I’ve thought about it ― which, lately, I have thought about it ― I’ve had the kind of fame which I felt was just the right amount. It’s really lovely if people come up to you and say, “Your work really means a lot to me” and “I like your work.” But to be chased around by photographers? That would not be a nice way to live.So you never had a craving to hit the next level?To be more and more famous? I guess not. Isn’t that funny? I guess not. I mean, in this business — I’m sure it’s true in many places, but it’s certainly true in our business — you need to be known in order to get more and better work. So, yes, I appreciate that if I worked, and worked well, I’d get better known, and then I’d get more and better work. That was always a true thing, which I did not negate at all.I wasn’t aware of drawing a line, but what I’m saying makes me think I did, because I didn’t long to be on everybody’s gossip column. That is not something that seemed attractive to me.Looking back, is there a particular role that let you feel like you’d made it?I don’t know about that. Every good piece of work really helped. Sometimes I’m not aware of the connections of it all. Just a few years ago, I did a scene on “The Americans.” I think it was about three years ago. It was a wonderful scene. As soon as they sent it to me, I thought, boy, they’re not usually this good, this complete, this well-written.I was very fortunate: I was busy, but they waited for me. I was shooting “The Nice Guys,” a movie, and that turned out really well. I have a feeling that, because I got a lot of acclaim for it, that made more and more television work come, more and more requests for me to do a guest-star.Now, I think that’s true, but I can’t be sure, because a lot of things change. For instance, all of a sudden there’s so much television, and certainly in New York. I’m not in a position to say “this caused this,” but that’s what it felt like to me. It made a difference in the employment track right there.“The Young and Beautiful,” when I did it in New York, I think I won every award I could have won, because it was off-Broadway that year. I think that also elevated my status.You mentioned knowing that the “Americans” role was acclaimed. How does that get filtered to you? Do you ever Google yourself?No, I didn’t Google it. First of all, when they actually finished it, before it was shown, I got a telephone call from the two producers. I found that really unusual. They had just seen it and they were really excited. Then, when it came out, a lot of people talked about it, and still do. And then I was nominated for some broadcasters’ award, and there would be little press things saying “should have gotten an Emmy.”I don’t care, but it’s that kind of thing. Many, many people remember it, and speak of it. It was a particularly good piece. There’s nothing like good work. It’s always the material and the people you work with.Were you familiar with Greta Gerwig before “Lady Bird” came along?Oh yes, I saw her as an actress and a writer, and I was enormously impressed with her as an actress, my goodness. But I had not met her until the first day of shooting. Somebody called my agent and asked if I wanted to do it, which I did.She has such a distinctive voice as a writer. What was she like as a director?Well, she was absolutely, as she herself described it, creating a safe place. She’s really something. And her first time directing? The major part of my part was shot the second and third day of the shoot, so I was very, very early in the shoot of her first film. I was very impressed. And then it went on and on for weeks while I wasn’t there, because my part’s little and it’s all concentrated. I think she’s really quite astonishing.Have you played a nun before “Lady Bird”?No! I haven’t.Every great actress has to play a nun at least once.Well, I’m glad I had a chance. Something reminded me of this, maybe the nun. William Wyler was casting “The Nun’s Story” with Audrey Hepburn, and I was pregnant. I remember when we spoke. We were talking about dates, and realizing the date they were proposing was almost immediately after [my due date]. We all just sat and looked at each other, and I thought, well, that would have been fun. I mean, this was in 1957.And you were offered the role but couldn’t take it because of the timing?You know, I’m not sure he actually offered it. We met, and I could tell in the room that I was certainly a high candidate for it. But that was that.See, everything comes full-circle. You didn’t play a nun then, and now you can play one now. She’s an interesting character because she’s so compassionate. It’s such a great character, to be a teacher. She’s so compassionate and involved and understanding of the kids she’s dealing with, but she’s a grownup.Often, popular culture presents nuns who go into education as strict and cloistered. It’s interesting to see a California spin on that, if you will. Did you grow up religious at all?Yes, I grew up Protestant. My family were devout Protestants. When I was little, I went to Sunday school and church all the time.Here we are on the day of the Gotham Awards. What is it like to be part of the Oscar conversation?Well, I guess it’s fun. It’s also exhausting. I don’t find award shows the most fun events in the world. I said the other day, “I’m not keen on the contest idea, both in our country and in our profession.”But it is there, and it’s hard to ignore it. It’s not something that I’ve been panting after in my life. And I feel I’ve had a lot of awards — more in theater than in film. Of course, it’s gratifying to be praised, to be valued. There’s no doubt about it. That’s lovely, it really is. So there’s an element of pleasure.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity."

As kids get older, they have a tendency to emulate peers who might dress controversially or behave inappropriately. What we seldom realize, however, is that we are the ones who, first and foremost, end up shaping the adults our children become and who influence most the choices that they make. So what defines “good” parental influence?We all want to raise kids who know who they are—their personality traits, their own weaknesses and strengths—so that they can make good choices when faced with curiosity and temptations. In order for them to learn this life-enhancing skill, we have to commit to being conscious and mindful in the day-to-day choices that we make while raising our children. But what does that look like in daily life?Here are three life habits we must master if we want to be a “good” influence on our kids:1. Take frequent trips inward to reflect on what you value that has been passed on to you from the adults in your life and take a personal inventory of what you do not value and do not want to pass on to your kids. The first part is easy. If you were influenced by parents or adults who were kind and compassionate, those lessons are part of who you are and what you will be proud to pass along to your kids. However, each of us carries baggage from our childhood that has not served us well; that is the self-reflection that we also need to focus on. These habits may be buried deep in our subconscious, but they will nevertheless show up in our lives.If your mother talked down to your father, chances are that you will do the same to your spouse ― despite your better judgment. If your father had a habit of yelling to be heard, that too may surface in your relationships. Why? Because we have been programmed for these actions during our growing years. These are the kinds of influences that we need to become aware of and pay attention to when we are raising our own children. Fixing the mismatch between what we want to pass on to our children and what we end up passing along to them requires a trip inward to address and heal the burdens of our past.As Dacher Keltner has said in The Power Paradox, “Life is made up of patterns. Patterns of eating, thirst, sleep, and fight-or-flight are crucial to our individual survival; patterns of courtship, sex, attachment, conflict, play, creativity, family life, and collaboration are crucial to our collective survival. Wisdom is our ability to perceive these patterns and to shape them into coherent chapters within the longer narrative of our lives.”This is the type of wisdom we call forth when we take a trip inward. Keep in mind, these patterns become most apparent when we are in conflict with our children. Repetitive disagreements are the markers that illuminate the deeper issues we need to address. They are an invitation to heal and grow. And when we become conscious of how we act and why, we can influence our children to lead a joyful life!2. Accept and respect children for who they are and what they stand for. Each child comes into this world with his or her own unique gifts, traits, and quirks. Judging our children and trying to fit them into societal molds hampers their spirit and their innate ability to thrive. It prevents them from learning the life lessons they need to grow. When we accept and respect them, that forms the foundation of our children’s self-understanding, self-respect, self-worth, self-confidence, and self-esteem.We teach our kids to accept their siblings, peers and friends, and to treat them with respect. Yet we often find ourselves asking our kids questions like, “How come your sister can listen and you don’t?” Or “If dumb Joey next door can accomplish this, why can’t you?” Or “You’re the only kid in class who argues with your teacher. What’s wrong with you?”When faced with repetitive challenges, flip your reaction to a response. First balance your child’s emotions with “This must be hard for you.” Then jog his or her intellect with “What do you want for yourself from this class?” or “Why do you feel you have to defend yourself with this teacher?” When we accept and respect children, we avoid jumping on an emotional train and instead become fully present with them. That way we build trust, a connection and a deeper relationship with them. This then helps kids understand themselves. The tone of voice we use with our children feeds their inner voice. Speaking to them kindly ― especially in adversity ― teaches them strong communication skills that will benefit them in every walk of life.3. Make sure your influence is worth passing on. We can only teach our children to experience the true essence of life if we know how to do so ourselves. Creating experiences for a joyful life is truly in our own hands. Let your choices be guided by honesty, integrity, values, and morals that leave a trail worth following. That means exemplifying a life of growth and love. Give your children core values that will help them cope with life’s challenges. Don’t just serve your own family unit but apply your efforts to your extended family as well. Shower your hospitality on your neighbors and community. Set standards for what’s most important in life—not things but connections to other people.We can only introduce our children to humility when we are humble ourselves. We can only teach our children to honor commitments if we do so ourselves. We can only advocate a good work ethic if we own one ourselves. Life is not hard. It can be as much fun as we want it to be. Infusing fun and laughter into your day-to-day life with children imprints memorable legacies and influences.The truth is that we should exert very little effort in teaching our kids anything! If we embody our ideals, our children will be influenced by those through sheer osmosis. It might seem like we are our children’s leaders. We are not. We help raise them for a short period of their life—from birth to 17 or 18 years old. After that, they grow their own wings and lead themselves through their own lives. But what we do do is influence the lifelong choices that they make by the life habits that we choose while they are under our influence, in our home and in our family.While we are in the midst of the merry holiday season, take a journey inward and identify how you want to positively influence your children. Implement those choices now to amplify the joy of this time of year and for a lifetime.Read more from Tools of Growth."

Blige and Meryl Streep will be wearing “all-black looks as a symbol of protest against harassment in Hollywood.”There are also murmurings that the black ensembles will continue throughout awards season.This quiet protest comes amid a national reckoning for men in power, including disgraced film executive Harvey Weinstein. Since dozens of women publicly accused Weinstein of sexual harassment and assault, other survivors have come forward to describe misconduct by stars like Louis C.K., Kevin Spacey, Matt Lauer and more. The movement has garnered such momentum that Time even named “The Silence Breakers” its Person of the Year for 2017.Hollywood stars also recently took a stand at the Emmys, where many wore blue ribbons to show support for the American Civil Liberties Union and the “Stand With the ACLU” initiative. Some also wore safety pins as a show of solidarity for marginalized groups after Donald Trump was elected president.The 2018 Golden Globes air on Sunday, Jan. 7 at 8 p.m. Eastern."
14,ARTS & CULTURE,New Allegation: Photographer Terry Richardson Sexually Assaulted Designer In His Studio Doorway,Emma Gray,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/designer-shares-new-abuse-allegations-against-photographer-terry-richardson_us_5a3041e0e4b07ff75afe6227,She’s coming forward 10 years later because she hopes her story might help younger women in the fashion industry.,2017-12-14,"Photographer Terry Richardson used a professional coffee meeting to corner and assault designer Lindsay Jones, she says.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a30265a1600004700c4f8a2.jpeg?cache=t4OmHJ6QYI&ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"Lindsay Jones never planned to speak publicly about her experiences with prolific fashion photographer Terry Richardson. The New York City-based designer and model considers herself a private person. She never wanted to harm anyone’s livelihood or hurt her own career or “cause drama” by divulging her story, she says.But some stories are too important to stay buried forever ― especially at a moment when thousands of accounts, some similar to the one Jones has kept close to her chest, are being excavated.“I have been sitting there quiet ... for a long time,” Jones told HuffPost. No more.Jones contacted HuffPost last month to talk about Richardson, famous for shooting the likes of Miley Cyrus, Beyoncé, Rihanna, Lena Dunham, Oprah Winfrey, James Franco, Kylie Jenner, Kim Kardashian, Jared Leto, Kate Moss and former President Barack Obama. During several phone conversations, Jones recalled how she met the photographer in either 2007 or 2008 for what she thought was a 10 a.m. coffee. She said she ended up leaving his studio in tears after Richardson cornered her, pulled out his penis and assaulted her.She said she chose to come forward now because she believes it could help other women ― specifically younger women entering the modeling and fashion industry today. Though Jones stressed that the culture of predatory men in fashion includes more than just Richardson, he is certainly emblematic of the problem. The photographer has faced public allegations of sexual misconduct and assault for nearly a decade, but he has denied the abuse accusations and has continued to get work from major brands and publications. Many of his defenders, (and Richardson himself) reason that the incidents happened during the making of sexually charged art, when lines supposedly get blurred. But Jones’ story is different. In her telling, Richardson assaulted her after she’d barely gotten in the door.Through his attorney, Lisa M. Buckley, Richardson “adamantly” denied Jones’ allegations. In a letter, Buckley referred to Jones as “an opportunistic publicity seeker” and said her account of the incident is “completely inconsistent with her actions over the ensuing years.” Buckley cited emails sent by Jones in which she asked to model for Richardson, retweets from Jones’ Twitter account and two comments on an Instagram post.When presented with Buckley’s letter, Jones told HuffPost via text, “It still happened so I’m not [too] alarmed.” Of her wish to work with Richardson after the alleged assault, Jones said, “I was brainwashed into thinking it was good for my career but I feel more empowered now.”* * * Jones said she first met Richardson outside of Balthazar, an expensive and perpetually sceney French restaurant in New York, sometime in 2007. Richardson was with a friend, sitting on a bench outside the restaurant. Jones said they began speaking after he motioned her over and asked where she was from. They talked about Utah ― Jones is from Utah, and Richardson told her he had an ex-girlfriend who grew up there ― and he expressed interest in doing a photo shoot with her. He was already a well-known photographer, and Jones, a longtime model and emerging designer, was intrigued. She gave him her number, and they started texting about scheduling over the following few weeks. That’s when Jones began to feel nervous. She knew that Richardson did traditional fashion shoots, but she had also seen photos of his that were more risque, even what she considered “vulgar.” Richardson was ― and is ― well known for these hyper-sexualized photos, some of which feature him engaging in sex acts. Jones was wary of the style. She was married at the time to a man she describes as French and “super traditional,” and she was worried that if she was photographed in an explicit way, it would upset her husband. At the time, she had not heard any stories about Richardson being abusive toward the models he worked with.“I’m very much into art and curating and design,” said Jones. “I’m very much OK with the nude body ... even erotic artwork I like sometimes. But there was an element to this particular artwork that had a real vulgarity to it that I was uncomfortable with.”So instead of automatically agreeing to work with Richardson, Jones asked if they could meet for coffee to discuss the shoot’s mood. He said yes and told her to come to his Bowery studio (which was also his apartment) on a weekday, around 10 a.m. As soon as she arrived at the studio, Jones said, things took a dark turn. She said she was cornered almost immediately by Richardson, who had a dog with him. “He didn’t let me pass the doorway,” she said. “If anything, he more, like, cornered me in the doorway with his dog and told me to get on my knees immediately. No ‘How are you?’ No coffee offered. No ‘Welcome to my office. This is my bedroom. How was your day? Can I take your bag?’ ― nothing. It was only, ‘Get on your knees.’”Jones was so startled and scared ― a “deer in the headlights,” as she described it ― that she acquiesced and got on her knees. “Now that I’m older, maybe I would have ran out,” she said, engaging in a familiar kind of “what if” mental exercise. “I just didn’t feel very secure.”Once Jones was on her knees, she said, Richardson pulled out his penis and told her to “suck his dick.” She told HuffPost that he then attempted to force his penis into her eye socket. He did this with such force that Jones remembers thinking that he might have given her a black eye. “I just wanted it to be over so I could leave,” she said, later adding: “He kind of turned me into ... [in] that moment I was at his disposal, as a commodity.” Richardson eventually masturbated to completion, said Jones, ejaculating in her mouth after ordering her to “swallow it like a good girl.” After the assault, Jones said, Richardson immediately told her to leave his apartment, directing her to pull up her low-riding pants on her way out. (She remained clothed during the assault.) Richardson never even brought up the photo shoot they were supposed to discuss.  “He was like, ‘You need to leave. I have a meeting. Pull your pants up,’” said Jones. Despite rarely crying before that, Jones remembers leaving the studio in tears, walking down to Canal Street and weeping on the sidewalk.  Over the following five weeks, Jones said, Richardson would text her sexually explicit requests, asking her again to “suck his dick.” After the fifth text, she responded “no” and deleted his number. She said she deleted the texts, too. Jones’ experience with Richardson bears similarities to allegations made by other women against the photographer. In 2010, model Jamie Peck accused Richardson of getting naked during a photoshoot and telling her to touch his penis. In 2014, Anna del Gaizo accused the photographer of pressing his penis repeatedly into the side of her face during a photoshoot, and model Sena Cech described a “revolting and humiliating” professional experience during which, she said, Richardson’s assistant asked her “to grab his penis and twist it really hard.” Despite the wide airing given these stories over the past several years, only in the last few months has Richardson begun to face lasting consequences. In October, both Condé Nast and Hearst cut ties with the photographer. (Richardson had reportedly already shot the January 2018 cover of Elle magazine.) Diesel dropped him, as did Valentino and Bulgari. (Other brands, including H&M, vowed to stop working with the photographer back in 2013.) But Richardson has continued to associate himself with smaller publications, such as Document Journal, Purple Magazine and CR Fashion Book (former Vogue Paris Editor-in-Chief Carine Roitfeld’s magazine) as recently as October. HuffPost contacted all three publications to ask if they planned to work with Richardson in the future and received no response. The photographer also maintains representation through Art Partner and an ongoing relationship with Galerie Perrotin in New York and Paris. Perrotin did not respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment. * * *In the immediate aftermath, Jones said, she kept the incident to herself and never considered reporting it to the police or her agency. After all, she still worked in the fashion industry ― an industry in which Richardson was a known, powerful entity. This reaction is a fairly common one. According to a 2012 report put out by The Model Alliance, 86.8 percent of models reported having been asked to pose nude without advance notice, nearly 30 percent of models said they had experienced inappropriate touching on the job and 28 percent said they had been pressured to have sex with someone at work. Most of these models said they hadn’t reported these incidents to anyone ― in part because they didn’t believe their agencies would be responsive or even see an issue. Eventually though, Jones did confide in someone: her best friend, musician and model Sibyl Buck. Buck confirmed to HuffPost that she and Jones discussed the incident several times over the years, and she recalled their first conversation happening around 2008. “What really struck me as so repulsive is that she described how he was abusive with his dick,” Buck said. She also told HuffPost that “everybody knew” in the fashion industry the stories of Richardson’s abusive behavior ― though before Jones confided in her, Buck had only heard generalized accounts about the photographer. Jones said she has interacted with Richardson only once since the “coffee meeting.” In September 2013, she was hired to model for the Diesel Playboy calendar, which Richardson was shooting. She grappled with whether to take the job but eventually decided to, feeling it was a smart career move. (More well-known models, such as Stella Maxwell, participated.) She also assumed there would be a large production team, which meant Richardson would probably behave. (“Around celebrities he doesn’t act the same way,” said Jones.)When she got to the shoot, Richardson introduced himself as though they had never met. At some point, they discussed Utah again, and Jones remembers Richardson talking about his father. “I can see why people like him,” said Jones. “I’m sure he has this really great, charismatic, creative side. It’s just that he still did the other thing.”Jones has spoken about her interactions with Richardson to a handful of people besides Buck. In October 2014, she did a shoot with a prominent filmmaker who was researching the worst things that have happened to people living in New York. The filmmaker, who prefers to remain anonymous, asked Jones on camera about her worst day. She told him about that morning with Richardson, later naming her attacker off-camera. The footage was never used in a film, but it still exists. The filmmaker confirmed the date and existence of the footage, as well as Jones’ account of her experience with Richardson to HuffPost.* * *Even as allegations of sexual misconduct, harassment and assault have piled up against Richardson over the past decade, he’s continued to find work and success in his industry. Buck believes he’s remained somewhat untouchable because of his status as a boundary-pushing artist. “Artists are traditionally allowed to be whatever weird way that makes them able to make the art that people appreciate,” said Buck. “He’s not an executive. He’s not someone that people are entrusting millions of dollars to. He’s someone that people hire to do what he does. And what he does is this creepy version of fashion.”Jones’ traumatic experience with Richardson, as well as a subsequent incident with another photographer that she declined to discuss, left her permanently cautious around male photographers.“I would warn the whole of the world: I would not enter a photographer’s studio unless there is a huge team there,” she said. “I’m a little PTSD, probably, but I never feel safe entering anyone’s apartment alone ever anymore. I carry pepper spray. I don’t like to enter apartments unless there’s a whole team with a creative director and a call sheet with very top-level production. I won’t go to someone’s house and talk to them about a shoot unless they’re a friend I’ve known for a very long time. Even if they have notoriety ― because a lot of the time, when they have notoriety it’s even worse.” Jones stressed that, while the story she is sharing now is about Richardson, she believes the fashion industry’s problem with predatory behavior extends further.“For straight, male photographers ― and a lot of them I love to work with, a lot of them are great ― I do feel like there’s a trend,” she said. “I’ve seen a lot of it ― these kind of ‘photo guys’ in action. And, like I said, it’s a much bigger problem than just Terry. A lot of the top people, and everyone under them too.”The founder of The Model Alliance, Sara Ziff, agrees with this assessment. Ziff, who began modeling when she was 14 years old, saw firsthand the conditions that leave models “uniquely vulnerable” to sexual harassment and abuse. In the modeling industry, the labor force skews young and female. (A 2012 Model Alliance report found that the majority of models begin their careers from ages 13 to 16.) And because models are often considered independent contractors, these young women and men aren’t afforded the same protections against sexual harassment in the workplace that full-time employees receive under federal law. It is common practice for modeling agencies to consider themselves management companies rather than employment agencies, which critics say allows these agencies to avoid being accountable for models’ safety, as well as to escape licensing requirements and sidestep commission limits. Moreover, the industry’s convoluted system ― in which clients usually book models through agencies, agencies usually cut the checks to the models, but then the models are typically not considered employees of the agencies or the clients ― means that models can simply slip through the cracks of labor laws.  Ziff is currently working with New York State Assemblywoman Nily Rozic to pass the Models Harassment Protection Act, which would formally extend workplace protections against sexual harassment to models. Ziff and The Model Alliance feel so strongly about closing the legal loopholes because they believe sexual harassment is widespread.“[Models] are working in what is often a very predatory environment,” said Ziff. “They’re working with much older male photographers. Often they’re being put on the spot to pose nude or semi-nude with absolutely no warning.”Agencies often tell models that they don’t have to do anything that they don’t want to do, that they should simply walk away or call their agent if they feel uncomfortable during a shoot. But Ziff pointed out that’s often easier said than done, especially when models are dealing with industry power brokers like Terry Richardson, who can make or break their careers. That’s why one of the first things Ziff did when she launched The Model Alliance in 2012 was to set up a grievance reporting service for models. More than five years later, Ziff said, she gets questions and complaints nearly every day. Through their reporting service, The Model Alliance advises models and connects them with the necessary support services and legal resources. Ziff usually recommends that models pursue channels of recourse that don’t involve the press; however, she also believes that “sunlight is the best disinfectant, and as people have been raising awareness on social media and speaking out to reporters, it’s been harder and harder for the industry to ignore.” * * *Jones knows that there will be people who will question why she waited 10 years to come forward with her story. For years she was afraid to stir up drama or cause irrevocable harm to her career. But in 2017, she’s older and more independent, no longer convinced that her livelihood requires the buy-in of powerful men. Terry Richardson “may be more powerful than me in the industry, but he doesn’t have that power over me anymore,” Jones said. “Whatever it was in my younger, more docile, aspiring, youthful self that I thought I needed from [powerful men] or the industry or their approval that I accept[ed] this treatment as part of the way it is, I don’t believe that anymore.”  Part of what pushed Jones to come forward now is the feeling that the culture is shifting, too. Millions have shared their #MeToo stories on social media. The “Silence Breakers” are Time’s Person of the Year. After a decade of worrying that speaking up might cost her her career, Jones thinks people might be ready to listen. “What’s happening right now is some kind of movement. There is some kind of strength in numbers,” Jones said. “Maybe it can make a ping of a difference in the world in a positive way eventually if we start to stand up for ourselves a little bit. So I guess that’s the real hope.”"

DeMille Award is our favorite thing. The Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which determines the nominees for the awards show, selected the media mogul for the prestigious honor ahead of the ceremony in January. The award annually recognizes an individual for “outstanding contributions to the world of entertainment,” and Winfrey certainly fits the bill. “As a global media leader, philanthropist, producer and actress, she has created an unparalleled connection with people around the world, making her one of the most respected and admired figures today,” HFPA President Meher Tatna said in a statement.Winfrey is the first black woman to receive the honor, and the 15th woman since the award was initially handed out in 1952.She was previously nominated for a Golden Globe for her performance in the 1985 film adaptation of “The Color Purple.” Last year, she was up for an Emmy as the executive producer of the HBO film “The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks.” She also received rave reviews for her star turn in the film. “For generations, Oprah has celebrated strong female characters on and off screen, and has been a role model for women and young girls for decades,” Tanta said. “Holding titles such as Chairman, CEO and Founder, Oprah is one of the most influential women of our time, and this honor is well deserved, especially in this 75th anniversary year of the Golden Globe Awards.”Winfrey took to Twitter after the announcement, calling the award an “honor.”The 63-year-old actress is in fine company, with previous recipients including Meryl Streep, Sidney Poitier, Audrey Hepburn, Barbra Streisand, Denzel Washington and George Clooney. 2012′s honoree Morgan Freeman recorded a special video message for Winfrey to celebrate her achievement."

Breed, the city’s District 5 supervisor, is serving as acting mayor, though her board colleagues may elect someone to replace her at any time. She will likely carry on in the role until a citywide mayoral election is held on June 5. The only other woman to serve as the city’s mayor was Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who held the position from 1978 to 1988. Breed is also only the second black politician to take the job, following Mayor Willie Brown’s tenure from 1996 to 2004. Like Feinstein did after Mayor George Moscone was assassinated, Breed is stepping into the role in the wake of an unexpected death that’s sent shockwaves around the city. “I ask for your patience, and I ask for your support, and I ask for your prayers,” Breed said at a Tuesday press conference. “Our city’s values have never been more important, and in the months ahead, let’s carry on in Mayor Lee’s honor.” City officials kept Tuesday’s press conference focused on commemorating Lee, so it’s unclear whether Breed’s ascent to the mayor’s office will prompt her to run in next year’s election. She has less than a month to decide, as the filing deadline to run is Jan. 9.Breed was elected to the Board of Supervisors in 2012 and named its president in 2015. A native San Franciscan who grew up in public housing in the district she represents, she has long emphasized affordable housing as a city priority. She worked on rehabilitating around one-third the Robert B. Pitts apartments in her district and proposed a district housing blueprint that suggests turning underutilized city spaces, such as parking lots, into housing complexes with hundreds of below-market dwellings. Last month, she and Supervisor Jeff Sheehy introduced legislation that would guarantee legal counsel for tenants in the case of evictions. But some of Breed’s critics say her voting record doesn’t align with her pro-tenant, pro-affordability message. On the Board of Supervisors, she’s backed some landlord-friendly legislation, voted against limiting the number of days an apartment may be rented out on short-term housing sites like Airbnb, and implemented a controversial rezoning policy that critics say increased density without lowering affordability. Despite that, she’s pushed back against those who describe her as a moderate in ultra-left San Francisco, where finding a solution to the housing crisis remains one of the most hotly debated topics.“At the end of the day, I think about my experiences, I think about how things have happened in my life, what were the unintended consequences, and how we can make better decisions so that it doesn’t negatively impact people the way things have negatively impacted my family,” she told local news blog Hoodline earlier this year. “[M]any of those policies have failed the people I grew up with,” she said, speaking generally about issues that she and her progressive colleagues have clashed on.Breed has also championed safe injection sites, developed the city’s Styrofoam ban and strengthened the city’s anti-graffiti laws.If she runs for mayor in June, she will likely face Mark Leno, a former city supervisor, state senator and assemblyman, who has already announced his candidacy. Assemblyman David Chiu is also rumored to be preparing to announce his candidacy. "
19,POLITICS,"Alabama Elects Doug Jones, The State's First Democratic Senator In 25 Years",Amanda Terkel and Andy Campbell,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/doug-jones-wins_us_5a3026a9e4b091ca26833755,Republican Roy Moore couldn't overcome accusations of child molestation.,2017-12-13,Democrat Doug Jones pulled off a surprise upset in Alabama's special election Tuesday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a3029801600001f00cf0d2b.jpeg?cache=C3lhlEkP2M&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This time, Donald Trump’s playbook didn’t work. Republican Roy Moore faced serious accusations of sexual misconduct in his bid to become Alabama’s next senator. But instead of bowing down and backing out, he stayed in the race and went on the attack ― just like Trump did in last year’s presidential race. He accused the media and the establishment of orchestrating a conspiracy against him, and cast the race as pitting good against evil, Christians versus everyone else. Both Trump and Moore bet that their conservative base would stick by them and push them to victory. But on Tuesday, Alabama sent a message that this time it wouldn’t work, not even in a conservative state that Trump won by 28 percentage points in 2016. Voters instead elected Doug Jones, making him the first Democrat to win a U.S. Senate seat in the state in 25 years. The Associated Press called the race for Jones 2½ hours after polls closed in the state. “We have shown the country the way that we can be unified,” an ecstatic Jones said in his victory speech Tuesday night. When Jeff Sessions stepped down as senator nine months ago to become Trump’s attorney general, it was considered a sure bet that the seat would remain in GOP control. But then Moore came along, defeating the establishment choice in the Republican primary and giving Democrats a glimmer of hope that they could win ― or at least do better than they thought possible in Alabama. Some Moore supporters were in disbelief Tuesday night. Willie Casey, 70, a Republican from Birmingham who was standing outside the Moore watch party, said there “has to be a recount.” “It was tight. I’m disappointed,” he told HuffPost. “I think [Sen. Richard] Shelby coming out against him made a huge difference, but I also think the whole thing is suspicious.”Moore himself refused to concede as well. Speaking to supporters at his election night party, Moore suggested the possibility of demanding a recount, saying, “God is still in control.”The controversial Moore, 70, had long been known for his conservative religious beliefs, opposing equal rights for Muslims and the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community. And though he won statewide races for chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, his vote counts underperformed compared with other Republicans on the ballot.Then in November, The Washington Post published an article in which four women accused Moore of pursuing them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. One of them said she was 14 when he sexually assaulted her. After that story came out, more women came forward with similar stories about Moore.Even after the bombshell allegations, Democrats were skeptical Jones, 63, could win. It was still Alabama, a state that Republicans dominate. But the Jones campaign set about focusing on three goals: 1) expand the Democratic electorate, especially by getting more African-American voters to turn out; 2) persuade some Republicans disgusted by Moore to vote for Jones; 3) hope other Republicans would simply stay home. National Democrats tried to help out by staying quiet. Associating with the party wouldn’t help Jones, who was trying to emphasize that he would work across the aisle and not be beholden to people like Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). Democrats also got lucky with Jones, who had a strong biography (he was a U.S. attorney who prosecuted Ku Klux Klan members for a 1963 church bombing that killed four African-American girls) and made few major missteps during the campaign. While Republicans are no doubt unhappy to lose a Senate seat, there are also some sighs of relief. There’s a solid case to be made that they’ll be able to win it back during the regular election in 2020, if they have a more traditional candidate. And now, they won’t have to constantly be on the defensive about being a party that harbors an accused child molester. They will still, however, have to contend with being the party that has a man accused of sexual misconduct by 19 women sitting in the White House. Moore supporters immediately began blaming the GOP establishment. Shelby, publicly condemned Moore and refused to vote for him, has earned the ire of many conservatives in the state recently. But Roger Bowman, 67, a Moore supporter from Millbrook, told HuffPost that Trump was also to blame for endorsing Moore’s opponent, Sen. Luther Strange (R-Ala.), in the primary. “I’m seriously angry. I’d like to say something to those establishment Republicans about this. That man [Jones] is a baby killer and we’re gonna put him in office?” Bowman said, referring to Jones’ support for abortion rights. “I have absolutely no use for Shelby now, I think he’s an idiot. I think Trump should have stayed out of Alabama helping Luther Strange like that. I’m a man who votes based on the scripture, and we didn’t get that tonight.”Chanel Rion, the 27-year-old fiancee of Missouri Senate candidate Courtland Sykes, said Jones’ win was a victory for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) who fought against Moore in the primary and was critical of him throughout the race. “There’s blood in the water for Mitch McConnell, it leads back to him. This room is gonna be walking out with a vengeance. We know who’s responsible,” she said at Moore’s party.“This election has proven that if three floozies and a fake headline can steal an election, then they’re gonna use this as a template to go further,” she added. Special elections aren’t reliable predictors for what will happen during a regular election. But Jones’ win gives a boost to the resistance movement that formed after Trump’s victory last year, and it underscores the importance for the party of investing in all 50 states ― so that when a Moore-like opportunity comes around, Democrats are ready to take advantage of it. It also showed yes, there are some allegations too grotesque for voters to stomach, even when a candidate follows Trump’s playbook.

The footage, which had been under seal for nearly two years, was recorded in a hallway outside the hotel room Shaver and Sweet were staying in. Brailsford and several other officers were at the hotel investigating a report that someone had pointed a gun out a fifth-floor window. They suspected Shaver was involved.Shaver can be heard crying and appears confused by some of the officers’ commands. In the footage, he says, “Please do not shoot me” as he obeys a command to crawl toward the officers.As he inched forward, Shaver reached toward his waistband, according to Brailsford, who then fired five rounds from his AR-15 rifle. Court documents obtained by HuffPost indicate the weapon was inscribed with the words “you’re fucked.” Shaver died at the scene.No weapon was found on or near Shaver’s body. However, investigators did find two pellet rifles in his hotel room. Those rifles were reportedly related to Shaver’s pest-control job. Authorities later learned that he was at the hotel on a work-related trip.Note: The video below contains graphic and disturbing imagery.The jury’s decision backed defense arguments that Brailsford feared for his life because Shaver reached for his waist.“I believed 100 percent that he was reaching for a gun,” Brailsford testified during his Maricopa County Superior Court trial.Brailsford was found not guilty on counts of second-degree murder and reckless manslaughter.Deputy County Attorney Susie Charbel had attempted to show that Shaver was unarmed and wasn’t a threat to Brailsford or two other officers who had drawn their weapons but did not shoot. A detective assigned to investigate the case said it appeared Shaver was attempting to pull his pants up.“If he can’t see their hand and what they’re doing, well he can’t just open up fire and kill him,” Charbel told the jury. “It’s not ... it’s indecent.”For Sweet, the verdict is a continuation of a nearly two-year nightmare.“It was an execution,” she told CBS News. “You had a man begging for his life, and he was shot five times for what? For his elbow coming up too high? For being confused? For being compliant? Why did he deserve to die? He didn’t.”Brailsford, meanwhile, has not publicly expressed remorse for the shooting. “If this situation happened exactly as it did that time, I would have done the same thing,” he said in court.Sweet has filed a wrongful death lawsuit in the case, which grabbed headlines around the world after the body camera footage was released.“I’ve been fighting for two years and screaming,” she said. “Finally, now, it took people watching my husband die a very horrible, inhumane death for people to care.”Sweet told CBS News her husband’s death has been especially difficult for her 8-year-old daughter. On Monday, she received a phone call from the school the girl attends.“She tried choking herself while she was at school, and told her friend that she wanted to die, so I spent all last evening with her in the hospital getting her psychiatric help,” Sweet said.When CBS asked if the child had said anything after being hospitalized, Sweet replied, “She told me that she wanted to be with her dad.”Send David Lohr an email or follow him on Facebook and Twitter.

25,WORLD NEWS,A Record Number Of Journalists Are Imprisoned Worldwide For Doing Their Jobs,Jesselyn Cook,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/reporters-prison-committee-to-protect-journalists_us_5a303a85e4b091ca26835e61,"More than half are behind bars in Turkey, China and Egypt, says a new Committee to Protect Journalists report.",2017-12-13,"Protesters in Berlin call for the release of German journalist Deniz Yücel, who has been detained in Turkey since February.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a3057141600001f00cf0ddc.jpeg?cache=crZPnfAuQg&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The number of journalists imprisoned around the globe hit a record high in 2017, with at least 262 reporters currently behind bars, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. They’re guilty of doing their jobs.In an annual report released Wednesday, CPJ said that 87 percent of those jailed journalists covered political news ― a particularly dangerous beat in many parts of the world. The report’s findings cover media workers imprisoned by state officials in relation to their work as of Dec. 1. Those who died in custody in 2017 or were released prior to Dec. 1 are not included in the year-end total.For the second year in a row, more than half of those detained are being held in just three countries: China, Egypt and Turkey, the world’s largest jailer of journalists.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan unleashed a stifling crackdown on dissent after a failed military coup in July 2016. His regime has engaged in brutal censorship, including mass arrests and sudden newspaper closures. With a stronger grasp on power than before, Erdoğan even described the attempted takeover as “a gift from God” just days after it happened.Deniz Yücel, a Turkey correspondent for the German newspaper Die Welt, was detained in February. The first foreign reporter to be held in pretrial custody in the wake of the coup attempt, he is accused of “inciting the public to hatred.” Erdoğan reportedly said Yücel is a terrorist because he interviewed a leader of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, which Turkey considers to be a terrorist organization.German Chancellor Angela Merkel has demanded Yücel’s release and vowed that her government will do “everything in its power” to secure his freedom.“A free and independent press is part of democracy and must never be questioned,” Merkel said, noting that Yücel “did nothing but do his job.”More than 1 in 4 imprisoned reporters worldwide is locked up in Turkey. Every single one is being investigated for “anti-state” crimes, according to CPJ.The organization also identified strongmen Xi Jinping and Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the respective presidents of China and Egypt, as press freedom predators.When Beijing unveiled its new generation of leaders in October, it didn’t identify a clear successor to Xi, further elevating his near-absolute authority over the nation of 1.4 billion people. The state of free speech has drastically worsened under his leadership in China, where 41 journalists are imprisoned, per CPJ. Many media workers detained there were arrested after making coerced confessions, according to Reporters Without Borders.In Egypt, where 20 journalists are being held, a draconian new anti-terrorism law has tightened the government’s strangling grip on the press. Some reporters spend years in detention without being charged or tried, Reporters Without Borders writes.An outspoken admirer of Erdogan, Xi and Sisi ― despite their well-documented histories of human rights abuses ― U.S. President Donald Trump has also vilified and threatened journalists. His own anti-media rhetoric and his failure to condemn the actions of those authoritarian leaders serve to “reinforce the framework of accusations and legal charges that allow such leaders to preside over the jailing of journalists,” CPJ asserts in its report.Trump decried the “fake news media” as the “enemy of the American people” in February and has hurled a litany of insults at journalists during his short tenure in the White House. During last year’s election, he denied campaign press credentials to multiple media outlets (including HuffPost), setting the tone for an equally hostile presidency.“Our task in helping to get reporters freed or prevent the detention of others is made harder by the perception that the United States is not as bright a beacon of press freedom as it once was,” CPJ’s deputy executive director, Robert Mahoney, told HuffPost.“When President Trump denigrates journalists and dismisses reporting that he does not like as ‘fake news,’ it undermines the value of the press in a democracy and sends a terrible signal to those in power around the world who have few institutional or political restraints on their ability to stifle critical voices,” Mahoney said. Instead of berating the media, CPJ and other press freedom advocacy groups have called on Trump to use his position to remind repressive regimes that journalism is not a crime."

Axios was the first to report on the existence of the fake document and the senator’s response. “This was an apparent effort to dupe reporters and smear a senator — both symptoms of an amped-up news environment where harassment charges are proliferating and reporters have become targets for fraud,” Axios’ Mike Allen reported. Over the summer, MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow had a similar experience and told viewers that her show had received a forged National Security Agency document seemingly filled with explosive allegations. The document, Maddow believes, was sent to her in an effort to discredit her show and other news organizations reporting on Russia’s interference with the 2016 presidential election.The fake document about Schumer was purportedly signed by a former staffer accusing the senator of sexual harassment. Axios reported the former staffer said her signature on the 13-page document, which was meant to look like a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court, was a forgery. The document had “obvious red flags,” according to BuzzFeed News’ Kate Nocera, who said she had also seen the document. The former staffer, whose identity has not been released, also told NBC News that she contacted the police over the fraudulent document. “The claims in this document are completely false, my signature is forged, and even basic facts about me are wrong,” the staffer said in a statement to Axios and NBC News.Schumer’s office also told Axios that every allegation in the document is false and that there are key errors throughout."

They were called liars. Their characters were attacked. They were accused of speaking out for personal gain, as though one ever gains from going public with allegations of sexual misconduct. Their personal lives were scrutinized. Their political leanings became a matter of national debate. Moore’s campaign in Alabama even created a “primer” on how to discredit them. And they had to listen as President Donald Trump, himself accused of sexual misconduct by over a dozen women, sided with Moore, choosing to believe one man over nine women. The president even went out of his way to mock one of them personally during a rally. “He says it didn’t happen,” Trump told reporters in November. “You have to listen to him, also.” In a surprising upset on Tuesday night, Moore was defeated. Voters instead chose Doug Jones, making him the first Democrat to win a U.S. Senate seat in the state in 25 years. His victory was propelled, in part, by women: They backed Jones over Moore by 17 percentage points in exit poll results. Mothers with children under 18 at home split even more heavily for Jones, preferring him to Moore by 34 points, according to exit polling.Coming forward was an act of incredible bravery. The women had, after all, seen what happened to those who dared to accuse Trump of sexual assault. Those women also had their personal lives turned upside down and examined inside and out.So to the women: Thank you. Thank you for having the courage to come forward.Thank you, Leigh Corfman.

The officials determined people had been cooking and sleeping in the brush area nearby, Peter Sanders, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Fire Department, told The Washington Post.No arrests have been made and the LAFD doesn’t have any suspects, reported the Los Angeles Times. The encampment’s location was entirely scorched, with only a few items, including a portable stove and cheese grater, remaining, according to the Times.Details about the fire’s origin have prompted some officials to call for more action on housing the homeless. LA’s homeless population jumped from 25,686 to 34,189 between 2015 and 2017.“The saddest thing is that we have so many homeless people,” L.A. Councilman Paul Koretz, whose district includes Bel Air, told the Times. “And they are everywhere in the city. And that sometimes causes serious problems.”The Bel Air blaze, dubbed the Skirball Fire, was one of several to rip through Southern California in recent weeks during one of the deadliest wildfire seasons in state history. The fire forced thousands to evacuate their homes and hundreds of schools to close. The blaze damaged or destroyed over a dozen structures, but was relatively small compared to the four other fires that burned throughout the region. The Thomas Fire, which has consumed areas of Santa Barbara and Ventura counties and continued to burn on Wednesday, has become the fifth largest fire in modern California history. As of Sunday evening, the fire had led to one death and burned more than 230,000 acres ― an area larger than New York City.As many as 90 percent of wildfires in the U.S. are caused by humans, according to the National Park Service. Experts say climate change has contributed to extreme weather patterns in California, including high temperatures and long periods of drought that create ideal conditions for wildfires to take hold."

Maybe they’d be learning in school about the ancient civilizations of Mesopotamia, reading poetry or the novel, Treasure Island. But they never made it out of the first grade.It’s been five years since the 2012 massacre at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. The bloodshed attributed to rampage shootings continues at a frenetic pace; to my count there have been more than 30 mass shootings since the unspeakable tragedy in Newtown. While there is progress being made in some related fields, as in school safety and neurological medical research, for example, the number of incidents and innocent lives lost is so painful, whatever progress made is lost in a tsunami of profound sadness and regression.Rampage murders bear a striking resemblance to another American crisis, that of suicide. In most cases that’s exactly what a rampage is. The murderers know they’ll be killed and often kill themselves before police can. That’s exactly what the Newtown killer did. Suicide is so obviously preventable, but is now the tenth most common cause of death in the U.S. and, relevant to rampages, the second highest cause of death among young people. The most notable and striking difference between the rampage and most suicides is the rampager also kills many innocent people, and innocent strangers at that.The motives of rampage killers like the Newtown murderer or the more recent Las Vegas killer are unknown. Perhaps there’s something to be learned from the rare rampager who somehow lives, like the killer in Aurora, Colorado (the 2012 “Dark Knight” theater massacre) or Tucson, Arizona (the 2011 “Congress on Your Corner” massacre).There is persuasive evidence that the rampage killers study the rampagers who precede them, even obsess about them, just as the Newtown killer did. They try to out-do their predecessors and achieve notoriety in death, unachievable in life. To that extent, major progress would be made if the major news media stopped using the killers’ names (as I did here), stopped publishing the killers’ pictures, ignored their rants, and stopped declaring their murders as “the deadliest.” Why award bloodthirsty murderers titles and achievements, like trophies on a mantel? The more the killers are made famous you can be certain their records will be broken.I went to a very moving ceremony a few years ago to honor the memory of Emilie Parker, one of the little angels murdered in Newtown. The ceremony was the opening of a playground in New London, Connecticut. It’s called “Emilie’s Shady Spot,” a lovely, playful, cheerful, pink playground, with pictures of butterflies. The playground was one of 26 playgrounds built by a group of New Jersey firefighters and paid for by generous donations. Playing on the sparkling new equipment, the children were running, climbing, playing, with bright smiles on their faces. I heard laughter. I fought back tears. More than 200 other people in attendance also fought back tears that morning. Sometimes it seems that’s all a person can do. Or is it? How many more playgrounds have to be built?"

They reportedly left to go to a restaurant with two officers, and were reported missing when they did not return.Government spokesman Zaw Htay confirmed the arrests to Reuters on Wednesday.“Yes it is correct that they were arrested,” he told the international news agency, which is based in London. “Not only your reporters, but also the policemen who were involved in that case. We will take action against those policemen and also the reporters.”The journalists were taken into custody for allegedly intending “to send important security documents regarding security forces in Rakhine State to foreign agencies abroad,” according to Myanmar’s information ministry. They face charges under the colonial-era Official Secrets Act, with a maximum jail sentence of 14 years.Reuters has closely covered the conflict in Rakhine State, where hundreds of thousands of minority Muslims known as Rohingyas have fled to escape violent, state-sponsored persecution. Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe had both been reporting on the crisis.Their arrests attest to “the erosion of press freedom in the country,” United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Thursday. “Probably the reason why these journalists were arrested is because they were reporting on what they have seen in relation to this massive human tragedy.”In a Facebook post on Friday, the U.S. embassy in Myanmar said the journalists’ families have not been allowed to visit them, and “don’t even know where they are being held.” The embassy also called the arrests “highly irregular” and demanded an explanation from the Burmese government. “For a democracy to succeed, journalists need to be able to do their jobs freely,” it said in an earlier statement. “I have been arrest,” Wa Lone texted to Reuters Myanmar bureau chief Antoni Slodkowski on Tuesday night, before his phone appeared to have been switched off. Reuters employees in Yangon filed a missing persons report, went to three police stations and asked a series of government officials about their disappeared colleagues, according to the publication. As of Friday, Reuters said it still had not been contacted by officials regarding the detentions. Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo “have been reporting on events of global importance in Myanmar,” Stephen J. Adler, Reuters’ president and editor-in-chief, said Wednesday. “We learned today that they have been arrested in connection with their work. We are outraged by this blatant attack on press freedom. We call for authorities to release them immediately.”Wa Lone, 31, joined Reuters in June 2016. He previously worked for English-language newspaper The Myanmar Times, and has written for HuffPost as a contributor. Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, has reported for Reuters since September.U Myint Kyaw, a member of the Myanmar Press Council, an independent organization that advocates for the news media, said he is “very concerned about the arrests of these two journalists.”Between 80 percent and 90 percent of government documents in the country are considered confidential or secret under the law, he told The New York Times.“Very few documents are public documents,” he said. “We don’t have a Freedom of Information Act in our country yet.”Media freedom “unfortunately does not have a place” among the Burmese government’s priorities, according to Reporters Without Borders. “Widespread racist attitudes towards the Rohingya people restrict free and independent coverage of the humanitarian crisis [there].”Shawn Crispin, a senior Southeast Asia representative of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo’s arrests “come amid a widening crackdown which is having a grave impact on the ability of journalists to cover a story of vital global importance.” CPJ calls for their immediate release, he added.State officials in Brussels, the U.K., Japan and Sweden have also expressed concern and said they are following the situation closely.This article has been updated with additional reactions to and details about the arrests.

Originally published in Yes! Magazine.Democracy lives or dies on the quality of public conversation. “Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government,” Thomas Jefferson wrote, “I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.”Today it doesn’t take the smarts of a Jefferson to realize that our public conversation, filtered through corporate-controlled, often-fractured media, is faltering. While analyzing how to fix our broken news system, from the promotion of public broadcasting to eliminating fake news, is complex, right now is a critical moment to hold the line. If we hope to reinvigorate our media, today democracy defenders are called upon to play defense—and quickly.Earlier this month, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai proposed a plan to dismantle net neutrality, an extremely worrying move—one that has provoked the ire of organizations and citizens across the country. And this Thursday, the commission will vote on the plan.If you’ve heard the term “net neutrality,” is it something you imagine only internet fanatics can grasp? Not at all. It simply refers to baseline protection ensuring that no internet service provider can “interfere with or block web traffic, or favor their own services at the expense of smaller rivals.” As such, it is integral to democratic dialogue. To abolish it, explains Craig Aaron, president and CEO of the media advocacy group Free Press, “would end the open nature of the internet and leave activists, media makers and all the rest of us at the mercy of the biggest phone and cable companies.”Needless to say, given the current composition of the FCC, the fate of net neutrality looks bleak.Yet, the recent history of net neutrality offers an encouraging story of the power of the people to protect the core democratic principle of free exchange and shows that even if things look bad, grassroots pressure holds the key to saving the internet as we know it.The story starts in 2010. That December, the FCC passed what those most concerned considered pretty weak half-measures prohibiting internet service providers from blocking websites or imposing limits on users, Aaron says. And by 2014, a federal lawsuit brought by Verizon succeeded in striking down even this half-measure. Verizon’s hubris ignited a massive call for the FCC to fight back. Protests demanded even stronger rules to reclassify internet service providers as “common carriers,” requiring them to act as neutral gatekeepers to the internet and to protect access for all.By May 2014, inspired by the Occupy Wall Street protests, concerned citizens had set up camp in Washington, D.C., at the FCC headquarters. It had all started with a protest organized by Margaret Flowers and Kevin Zeese. Flowers, a pediatrician who cut her teeth in the fight for universal health care, and Zeese, a lawyer who fought injustices in the 1980s’ war on drugs, announced at the protest’s end that they were not going to leave. The duo rolled out their sleeping bags on the grass, stayed the night, and before they knew it, the occupation grew drastically. Fellow concerned citizens flooded in with tents and banners. One day followed the next, each to the tune of passing cars honking in solidarity. Not only did employees of the FCC come out to thank the occupiers, but three of the five FCC commissioners came to meet Flowers and Zeese.A week later, then-FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler put out a “notice of proposed rule-making” that asked the public, “What is the right public policy to ensure that the internet remains open?” The preferred solution put forward by the FCC, outlined in the notice, would have left the door ajar for a “two-tiered internet” plan, wherein internet service providers could sell content providers priority access to their subscribers at rates only big companies could afford. Citizen reformers couldn’t and wouldn’t get behind this proposal.But the notice also sought public comment on whether the FCC should “reclassify” the internet as a common carrier under the law. Doing so would give the FCC greater legal authority over providers to fully and truly keep the internet open. This request for comments gave citizens, especially those emboldened by the FCC occupation, an opening.For months citizens continued protesting and spreading awareness about the importance of net neutrality. Leading up to the closing of the comment period in September 2014, the activist group Fight for the Future parked a Jumbotron outside FCC headquarters. The giant video billboard played videos of fellow citizens explaining why net neutrality mattered to them. Later, reformers performed a skit outside the FCC, a “Save the Internet Musical Action.” The musical’s chorus—“Which side are you on, Tom? Which side are you on?”—would soon be answered.These courageous public actions built on the momentum sparked by the FCC occupiers. Together, they galvanized citizens to submit 4 million comments to the FCC. The FCC chairman reversed his position, endorsed strong rules, and moved to restore the agency’s authority. In February 2015, the FCC announced it would reclassify internet service providers as common carriers. Wheeler called it “the proudest day of my public policy life.” Another FCC commissioner called it “democracy in action.”The victory taught one very important lesson. As Flowers put it, “it showed we don’t have to compromise. We can actually stay true to what we are fighting for and win.” For that win, a broad coalition of citizen power united folks ranging from the tech industry—such as Netflix and Tumblr—to the Black Lives Matter movement. They all understood the democratic value of a free internet on which independent media is kept accessible and online grassroots organizing is made possible. “This cross-generational and multi-issue movement was critical in pressuring the FCC commissioners and lawmakers to support net neutrality,” Aaron says.The situation in which we find ourselves today is different from how it was in 2014. The composition of the FCC has changed, and, after a year of resisting President Trump’s agenda, many perceive grassroots activists to be tired. Yet, the takeaway from the above story is that citizens have untold political power and, when they effectively wield it, can influence even politically removed bureaucrats to win major democratic victories.Countless Americans are already rising to the challenge. Recently, more than half a million people called Congress about net neutrality and approximately the same number filed comments on the FCC website. Moreover, on Tuesday, activists across the country began a “Break the Internet” campaign to raise as much awareness about the issue as possible before the FCC’s critical vote. According to Aaron, “public awareness has never been higher.”This grassroots pressure will have to be sustained and significantly expanded to save the internet. And even if the FCC votes to repeal net neutrality, the fight must continue. Concerned Americans will have to pressure Congress to pass a bill to overturn the FCC decision. The fate of democracy depends on it.Adapted from Daring Democracy: Igniting Power, Meaning, and Connection for the America We Want by Frances Moore Lappé and Adam Eichen (Beacon Press, 2017).

The occurrence of such a strong storm was also about three times more likely to happen, the authors concluded.Those statistics represent a lower boundary, but in one study, researchers’ best estimate said Harvey’s rainfall was nearly 38 percent worse than a comparable storm from the 1950s.“Climate change made this event more likely and heavier,” Karin van der Wiel, a researcher at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute and a co-author of one of the papers, told The Washington Post.Scientists have long linked climate change to an uptick in damaging natural disasters and said our warming world may soon see bigger and more frequent wildfires, floods and storms. The Post notes some have linked weather events to climate change in the past, including a drought in Texas in 2010 and flooding in Colorado in 2013.But only recently, in an effort to counter misinformation, have researchers moved to so quickly link an unprecedented event to climate change, including an effort by a group of scientists known as World Weather Attribution, of which Van der Weil is a part. Harvey was no exception. The storm brought unprecedented rain, up to 50 inches in some places, to the Texas coast in August after landing as a Category 4 hurricane. Over several days, the storm flooded large parts of Houston, displaced tens of thousands and killed more than 80 people.Researchers said they were struck by the intensity of rain after using climate models to compare data from Harvey to conditions that would have created a similar storm a century ago, before greenhouse emissions caused the planet to warm.“The amount of precipitation increase is worse than I expected,” Michael Wehner, a senior scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and an author of the other paper, told The New York Times.Despite the intensity of the weather event, some moved to quickly distance the hurricane from global warming. Among those were President Donald Trump, who said America “had bigger storms” than Harvey or Hurricane Irma in the past when asked about their links to climate change. An even more bizarre claim was made by conservative pundit Ann Coulter, who said she’d blame Houston’s lesbian mayor for Harvey before climate change.Scientists didn’t investigate whether the actual formation of the storm was due to climate change but said the dramatic results of their research confirmed that storms such as Harvey can likely be made worse by human activity.Van der Weil said that even if the world is able to limit global warming to the levels established by the landmark Paris climate agreement, the probability of witnessing another storm like Harvey would increase by a factor of three.“If we miss those targets, the increase in frequency and intensity could be much higher,” she said in a statement."

It’s a message the film’s co-director Lee Unkrich alluded to when he announced his father’s death via Twitter on Sunday night.“My father, Bob Unkrich, died tonight at 93,” the director tweeted. “He was an artist and a World War II Army hero. He stormed the beach at Normandy. I’m so thankful I was able to spend time with him last week and show him ‘Coco.’ He loved it.”“He’ll be on our ofrenda next year. I’ll always remember him,” he added, referencing the traditional ofrendas, or altars, that people build in honor of their deceased loved ones during Day of the Dead. Attached to the moving message was a photo of Unkrich’s father watching “Coco” from his home. The director first tweeted the picture in late November, saying that he had visited his father to show him the film because he was “too frail” to see it in theaters. “Coco” was nominated for two Golden Globes on Monday: the movie was nominated in the Best Motion Picture, Animated category, and the song “Remember Me” was nominated in the Best Original Song, Motion Picture category. “I think the film has been very meaningful to many, many people, and we’re so happy for that because the entire time we were making it, we were trying to make a film that was respectful and culturally authentic, but that would also be universally appealing and relatable to people all over the world,” Unkrich told HuffPost on Monday.

38,POLITICS,Does Moore’s Loss Mean A Reckoning For Trump? Don’t Count On It.,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-moore-alabama-loss_us_5a30598be4b07ff75afe89b3,"Trump may have lost even more stature, but not enough for the GOP Congress to turn on him.",2017-12-13,Sarah Huckabee Sanders has clarified that her statements about Trump's female accusers are not her own.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a3081cb1600001f00cf0e3c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON – Calling women who accuse you of misdeeds liars. Flat-out denying even knowing them. Threatening lawsuits.It turns out these Donald Trumpian tactics of dealing with sexual misconduct allegations might only work for President Donald Trump, as Republicans now face the fallout of a stunning loss of a Senate seat in deep red Alabama, despite the full-throated support of their candidate by the president himself.Just as Trump denied having done anything improper to the 19 women accusing him as he ran for president, Roy Moore also denied allegations from multiple women that he pursued them as teenagers, including one woman who described an encounter that, because of her age at the time, would have been sexual assault.But while Trump managed an Electoral College victory thanks to razor-thin margins in three key states, Moore is not heading to the Senate to represent Alabama.“Donald Trump’s endorsement doesn’t make as big of a difference as he might think it does,” said Rory Cooper, once a top aide to House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, who unexpectedly lost the GOP primary for his Richmond, Virginia, seat in 2014.Cooper guessed that Republican leaders will now want to move past the entire episode as quickly as possible. “People will do their best to put their heads down and pretend like it never happened.”A sweeping GOP loss in Virginia’s statehouse elections last month began making Republicans nervous about having their fortunes tied to a deeply unpopular president. Many explained it away by calling Virginia a Democratic state, even though current Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe barely won his race four years ago.The loss in solidly Republican Alabama, though, will likely have a different rationale: Moore was so damaged a nominee that no broader lessons can be drawn from it. “He’s such an awful candidate that I don’t think we can extrapolate,” said Matt Mackowiak, a Texas GOP consultant and chairman of the Travis County party. “The category of sexual assault against children is in its own universe.”The GOP party establishment had never been crazy about Moore, who had been twice removed from the Alabama Supreme Court for defying federal court orders and who has a long record of controversial statements. When a string of women started coming forward to accuse Moore last month, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and other party leaders denounced him ― only to have Trump come out to support him. Trump argued that he believed Moore’s denials, and since then has repeatedly asked Alabamans to vote for him, including via recorded “robocalls” to households.Trump’s eagerness to support Moore put party leaders, some in his administration and even his own family, in an awkward position. His daughter Ivanka Trump told the Associated Press, “There’s a special place in hell for people who prey on children” ― only to have her father then endorse this presumably hell-bound candidate.On Sunday, United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley told CBS News of Trump’s female accusers, “Women who accuse anyone should be heard. They should be heard and they should be dealt with.” The remark reportedly angered Trump. On Monday, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders issued a rare clarification that her statements about Trump’s female accusers were not her views, but Trump’s.“I’m here to speak on behalf of the president,” she said. “And I can say that the president has directly responded and said that these allegations are false, and that’s what I’m doing in relaying that information to you.”This discomfort notwithstanding, Republicans doubted it would lead to any distancing between Trump and GOP members of Congress heading into the 2018 midterms, even as more Democrats clamor for congressional investigations into the accusations against the president.“I don’t see any impetus for Republican leaders who haven’t distanced themselves already to do so now,” Cooper said. “I just don’t see how it happens.”Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who was among the 16 GOP candidates who ran against Trump in the 2016 primary, delivered the identical message that Trump’s White House has been using regarding Trump’s accusers. “Those allegations were vigorously ligated during the 2016 election. The American people had them before them,” Cruz said.John Weaver, who ran the campaign of Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) in the 2016 primaries, said congressional Republicans will never challenge Trump, even if it means damaging their own chances in next autumn’s congressional elections.“I’ve not seen a more cowardly group of people in my life,” he said. “He’s leading the way over the cliff. And they’re blindly following along. They’re afraid of him.”Igor Bobic contributed to this report."

41,POLITICS,Democrat Wants DOJ Memo That Could Show Trump's Judicial Pick Lied To Senate,Sam Levine,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cory-booker-thomas-farr_us_5a3141b5e4b01bdd76592c34,A former DOJ official says one of Trump's judicial picks misled the Senate about his knowledge of a campaign to intimidate black voters.,2017-12-13,"Notes from J. Gerald Hebert, a former Justice Department official, show that Thomas Farr may have known about a plan to send postcards targeting African-American voters earlier than he told the Senate.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a1441ce140000891d50e9c1.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) asked the Department of Justice on Wednesday to provide him with an internal document that could prove one of President Donald Trump’s picks for the federal bench lied to the Senate about his role in an effort to intimidate African-American voters.Thomas Farr, who Trump tapped for a lifetime seat on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, served as a lawyer for the campaign of then-Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) in 1990. Shortly ahead of Election Day, the Helms campaign and Republicans sent out more than 100,000 postcards targeting African-Americans in the state. The postcards gave incorrect information about voter qualifications and falsely told voters that when they went to vote, they would have to tell polling officials how long they’d lived in their precinct. The postcards also said election fraud could be punished by up to five years in jail. The Department of Justice sued the campaign and the Republican Party, charging them with violating the Voting Rights Act. The parties eventually settled the case with a consent decree.In September, Farr told the Senate as part of his confirmation hearing that he’d known nothing about the plan to send the postcards. But J. Gerald Hebert, a deputy chief in the voting section at the time, said he kept contemporaneous notes on the case that showed Farr had been consulted about the plan before it was executed. In a 1992 complaint, the Justice Department said the Helms campaign met in October 1990, before the postcards went out, to discuss ballot security ― and “an attorney who had been involved in past ballot security efforts on behalf of Senator Helms and/or the Defendant North Carolina Republican party” was there. Hebert says the attorney was Farr.The Senate judiciary committee approved Farr’s nomination in October, but Hebert’s information, first reported by INDY Week, prompted calls for the committee to recall him for further questioning.Booker asked Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Wednesday to provide him with a 1991 Justice Department memo containing the results of DOJ’s investigation into the postcard scheme and recommending whether to bring charges. Booker only wants the section of the memo outlining the facts of DOJ’s investigation, which could contain information about Farr’s possible involvement and knowledge of the postcards.“It contains facts and legal arguments that support the filing of a lawsuit,” Booker wrote in the letter to Sessions. “It is clear to me that this memo is essential in determining whether Mr. Farr misled the Senate Judiciary Committee.”Hebert told HuffPost that the 1991 memo “did exist and is likely in their files.” While he said DOJ was likely to redact the legal analysis, it has produced redacted memos showing the facts of an investigation in the past.Booker also sent a letter to Farr Wednesday asking him to explain the discrepancies between his recollection and Hebert’s. The New Jersey Democrat asked Farr to provide more details on the work he did for the Helms campaign in 1990 as well as in 1984.The letters come amid continued scrutiny over Trump’s picks for the judiciary. On Tuesday, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the chairman of the judiciary committee, told CNN he’d advised the White House to “reconsider” Trump’s nomination of Jeff Mateer for the federal bench in Texas, as well as Brett Talley for the judiciary in Alabama. Talley, who’s faced criticism for inflammatory online posts and failing to disclose to the Senate that his wife is a White House lawyer, reportedly offered to withdraw his nomination on Tuesday.After Senate Republicans delayed confirming President Barack Obama’s nominees for the judiciary, Trump has moved swiftly to fill the federal judiciary with conservative judges. Because the judges receive lifetime appointments, it’s a legacy that will last long after Trump leaves office.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story said that Booker is a member of the Senate judiciary committee. He is not."

Al Franken (D-Minn.), who was also accused of sexual misconduct, from their midst.Some Democrats say that Trump should resign over the allegations numerous women have levied against him. Several of those women told their stories again this week as part of a growing movement to hold powerful men accountable for their actions.“These allegations are credible; they are numerous. I’ve heard these women’s testimony, and many of them are heartbreaking,” Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) said this week.Other Democrats, however, questioned the point of calling on Trump to do something he’s unlikely to do. While they welcomed the prospect of an investigation into Trump’s past, those lawmakers argued that Democrats should focus on challenging Trump in other ways instead.“Look, he’s not going to resign,” Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), the Democratic vice presidential nominee in last year’s presidential election, told HuffPost on Tuesday. “So let’s not play games. He has no shame. There’s nothing you can do to shame him into resigning. So we just have to play the role that we have to be an emergency brake against all the ways he’s abusing people and our values and our country’s reputation.”Most Democrats seemed more comfortable with a half-measure ― calling on Congress to hold hearings into the allegations against Trump. Nearly 60 Democratic congresswomen signed a letter on Monday urging the House Oversight Committee to investigate, and several Democratic senators followed suit on Tuesday.“The president should be held accountable for his conduct, so I believe that there should be some way that is done,” Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) said.Asked whether Trump should resign over the allegations, however, Cardin said he was “going to hold off on that question.”Sens. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) similarly raised concerns about the allegations, but stopped short of calling on Trump to step down.Democrats’ differing stances reflect the difficulty of figuring out a unified message ahead of next year’s congressional midterm elections. Politically, it may be safer to call for an investigation into the allegations against Trump than for an outright resignation or even impeachment. Those more extreme measures could backfire in places Trump carried in last year’s presidential election that Democrats are now targeting.Notably, no Democratic senators representing states Trump carried last year joined calls for his resignation. Those who did include prominent progressives, including Gillibrand, Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.). Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), who is up for re-election next year in a state Trump carried by nearly 11,000 votes, said she “certainly would support” a congressional inquiry into the allegations against him. But she declined to say whether Trump ought to step down, noting only that she didn’t support him during the election.Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) said Trump needed to be held accountable, and that he would “be looking at what the proper venues” would be where that could happen.Republicans, meanwhile, flatly dismissed talk of an investigation into the allegations against Trump as political gamesmanship. Even those who criticized Franken for his actions defended Roy Moore, the Alabama GOP Senate candidate accused of preying on minors.Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) called the allegations against Trump a moot issue.“Those allegations were vigorously ligated during the 2016 election. The American people had them before them,” Cruz said.Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) said Congress had the power to investigate the president, but added that “the most prominent the way you do that is with impeachment, and that’s not on the table at this point.”Asked if Congress should investigate sexual assault allegations against Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said, “What we’re in charge of here is the Senate.”Republicans also ducked questions about Trump’s attacks against Gillibrand, whom he called a “lightweight” and “a total flunky” on Twitter. The president claimed the New York Democrat “begged” him for campaign donations in the past and “would do anything for them” ― a phrase Gillibrand and other Democrats singled out as a “sexist smear.”“It was disgusting. It’s clear what he was getting at,” a visibly angry Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) told reporters on Capitol Hill. “He was disgusting.”White House press secretary Sarah Sanders disputed that characterization, however, telling reporters on Tuesday there is “no way” Trump’s tweet was sexist. “Only if your mind is in the gutter” would one get that impression, she said.Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) apologized that she could not comment on Trump’s tweet about Gillibrand because she doesn’t “follow his Twitter.”After a reporter offered to show her the tweet, Ernst said, “No, I would rather not. Thank you.”"

In the letter, they voiced their opposition to the controversial Pebble Mine near Alaska’s Bristol Bay.“The question of whether to build a massive open pit copper and gold mine in the heart of the planet’s largest wild sockeye salmon fishery has a simple answer,” the authors write. “The Pebble Mine is the wrong mine in absolutely the wrong place, and the answer is no.”Environmental, tribal and business groups also signed on to the missive, including the Natural Resources Defense Council, the United Tribes of Bristol Bay and Commercial Fishermen for Bristol Bay.The EPA, now under the stewardship of Scott Pruitt, moved to reverse an Obama-era decision to block the mine in May after executives of the Pebble Limited Partnership, the developer of the project, sued the government.At the time, the executives praised Pruitt for his “commitment to the rule of law” and said they would move to file a new application for a permit to proceed with the mine, according to The New York Times.The EPA in July also moved to withdraw a former determination made under the Clean Water Act that would have imposed restrictions on the site.The Hill notes that a lengthy permitting process won’t see a mine in Bristol Bay for years. But an amenable Trump administration ― which has done little to protect the environment over the past year ― has activists and local fishermen worried about one of the world’s largest sockeye salmon fisheries.“We oppose the Trump Administration’s efforts to sweep nearly a decade of science and Clean Water Act review under the rug,” Tuesday’s letter says. “The record is clear: The Pebble Mine is fundamentally flawed ― it’s the wrong mine in the wrong place.”“Protect the greatest salmon fishery on the planet,” the authors conclude. “Protect Alaskans and the Bristol Bay watershed.”Read the full letter below."

Here are five more key things to know about Alabama’s new Democratic senator-elect. 1. He was in high school during desegregation of Alabama’s public schools.Jones grew up in 1960s Alabama, a violent era he cites as the reason why he devoted his legal career to championing civil rights. Jones was a member of student government who worked to build relationships and befriend the newly admitted black students.2. This sentence appears on his campaign website: “I want to be perfectly clear: I believe in science.”The career prosecutor opposed President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change, and he identified the environment as one of the six key priorities of his candidacy.“Clean air and clean water are not controversial,” Jones wrote on his website. “They are essential to our health, our prosperity, and our quality of life.”3. In 1997, President Bill Clinton appointed Jones as U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Alabama.Jones was nominated by Clinton, a Democrat, and approved by a majority Republican Senate.Soon into his tenure, Eric Robert Rudolph bombed a Birmingham abortion clinic, killing an off-duty police officer and injuring another person. Though Rudolph was arrested after Jones left office, the attorney general worked on his indictment.4. He’s longtime friends with former Vice President Joe Biden, and he worked on Biden’s 1988 presidential campaign.Biden campaigned with Jones in October and recorded robocalls that went out to voters just before the special election. “Doug and I have been friends for a long, long time,” Biden told a crowd in Alabama, according to AL.com. “Doug knows Alabama. He knows your heart, and he’ll never let you down.”The former vice president was also quick to congratulate his friend for his victory.5. Jones’ father was a manager at U.S. Steel. One of his grandfathers was a steelworker, the other a coal miner.The senator-elect also worked a union job at a steel mill while growing up outside Birmingham. “The respect I learned for my parents and grandparents ― the hard work they did has shaped my respect for those who work to feed a family ― and try to make their children’s lives better,” Jones wrote on his website. His family roots also inform his approach to environmental policy, citing the “enormous sympathy” he has for families in Alabama who have lost their jobs as coal prices have declined. Jones has called for job retraining for affected workers. BONUS FACT: Coincidentally, Jones and his wife, Louise, celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary the night he won the Senate race."
45,POLITICS,Doug Jones' Win Breaks Alabama's Long Record Of Electing Climate Change Deniers,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/doug-jones-climate_us_5a318833e4b07ff75affe283,The lesson to Democrats: Don’t shy away from climate change.,2017-12-13,Alabama Sen.-elect Doug Jones at his victory party late Tuesday night. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a31898f1600000f12cf10e1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For the last two decades, climate scientists have been issuing increasingly grave warnings to lawmakers about greenhouse gases warming the planet. And, for just as long, Alabama senators have been brushing them off. That changed on Tuesday night.Doug Jones, the first Democrat elected senator in the state in 25 years, listed a “belief in science” and a will to “work to slow or reverse the impact of climate change” as the sixth of 10 platform issues on his campaign website. In October, the League of Conservation Voters named Jones one of its first Senate endorsements. As he barnstormed the state, the 63-year-old inveighed against the injustice of a befouled environment and unsafe drinking water. Alabama is already suffering the effects of climate change. The Heart of Dixie emerged in June from more than a year of “the worst drought in memory,” affecting 98 percent of the state. Alabama dodged the worst damage of a series of devastating hurricanes that wreaked havoc throughout the region earlier this year. But while 63 percent of Alabamians believe global warming is happening, just 48 percent understand it’s caused primarily by humans, according to 2016 survey data from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication.Jones won by a small margin against Republican Roy Moore, a flagrant bigot and former judge whom several woman came forward during the campaign to accuse of child molestation and sexual harassment decades ago. Kert Davies, a researcher and director of the Climate Investigations Center, said Jones’ stance on climate change likely didn’t sway many voters.“Climate wasn’t a key factor in motivating voters of course,” he told HuffPost by email. “But you now have one more climate believer and one fewer climate denier in the Senate, and that is a very good thing.”Anthony Leiserowitz, a senior research scientist at Yale University and the director of the climate program, warned that Jones would be unlikely to crusade on that issue in his first term. “Doug Jones is going to be a very different vote in the Senate on climate change than Roy Moore would have been,” he told HuffPost. “But climate change was not a significant theme in this election, so I don’t expect Jones to immediately lead on the issue.”The state’s political representation in the Senate reflected the state’s broader climate skepticism.Jeff Sessions, who vacated his Alabama Senate seat to become attorney general, denies that global warming is a problem, and railed against efforts to help poorer countries adapt to rising seas and more extreme weather. Republican Sen. Richard Shelby, the state’s senior lawmaker in the chamber, dismisses global warming as cyclical, a popular argument among deniers.Moore, a former Alabama chief justice, refuted the 97 percent of researchers who agree that climate change is real and caused largely by burning fossil fuels, and advocated for increased coal and oil use during his campaign. Indeed, the state’s entire seven-person House delegation, including Democratic Rep. Terri Sewell, either deny climate change or have voted for bills predicated on rejecting or ignoring the scientific evidence behind it. But Jones, a former federal prosecutor, campaigned on a theme of justice, which Daniel Tait, an Alabama-based researcher at the nonprofit Energy & Policy Institute, said included “really strong points on things like clean air and clean water.”“It was never explicitly environmental justice, but these things are being used in Alabama as issues of fundamental fairness and what’s right and wrong,” Tait told HuffPost by phone on Wednesday. In places like Butler County, a United Nations official surveying extreme poverty in Alabama found raw sewage flowing from exposed PVC pipes into open pools near homes, according to a report on AL.com. Alabama ranked second in the nation for the most sites with drinking water contaminated by a toxic, cancer-linked chemical used in Teflon, a study found in June. “Those things are ultimately part of a climate message on a national scale,” Tait said. “But that type of message really resonates in Alabama and helps bring more people into the coalition.” White evangelical Christians, who overwhelmingly voted for the ostentatiously religious Moore, are the least likely of any U.S. faith group to believe climate change is occurring, according to 2015 data from the Pew Research Center. Only 28 percent of white evangelicals believe the planet is warming primarily due to human activity, and about 37 percent say they don’t believe the climate is changing at all. By comparison, 77 percent of Hispanic Catholics, like 70 percent of Hispanics overall, said they believe the Earth is warming due to human activity, as did 56 percent of black Protestants. The black voters who turned out in historic numbers to propel Jones to victory offer a hint as to whom Democrats should target their message on climate change, according to RL Miller, president of Climate Hawks Vote, a super political action committee. A jaw-dropping 98 percent of black women and 93 percent of black men cast ballots voted for Jones, according to exit polls.“This is a victory for the climate justice wing of the climate movement insofar as African American turnout carried the day, and a loss for the traditional conservation voters (hunters and fishers) aka rural white voters,” Miller told HuffPost. “Environmentalists in general need to realize that the rural white working class is not going to vote climate no matter how much their hunting and fishing grounds are threatened, and instead focus on making inroads with climate justice-oriented voters.”To Jeff Hauser, a veteran progressive Democratic operative, the takeaway for Democrats is clear: Don’t waver on climate change to appeal to conservative voters. “Doug Jones ran as a principled Democrat with a mainstream progressive platform in one of America’s most conservative states and crushed expectations,” Hauser told HuffPost. “The lesson is that it’s hard to imagine a race almost anywhere in America in 2018 where a serious commitment to fighting climate change would harm a Democrat, whereas we are reminded that running on sincere substantive commitments can indeed inspire shockingly strong turnout.”"

The Associated Press reported on Tuesday that the president “fumed” when he heard about Haley’s Sunday morning interview on CBS’s “Face The Nation.” Two people who are close to Trump relayed his reaction to the AP anonymously because they weren’t authorized to share the private conversations.During Sunday’s interview, Haley said she was “proud” of the “strength” and “courage” many women have shown when coming forward with accusations of sexual misconduct in the past few months. “Women who accuse anyone should be heard. They should be heard and they should be dealt with, and I think we heard them prior to the election,” Haley said when asked about Trump’s accusers. “I think any woman who has felt violated or felt mistreated in any way ― they have every right to speak up.”Trump has repeatedly denied all of the accusations, most recently tweeting that women he didn’t know were making “false accusations.” In October, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders suggested that all of Trump’s accusers were lying."

I can see the enormous gloom ahead from 50 miles away ― brown smoke hovering over the southern edge of a fire that had consumed a staggering 230,000 acres so far.I’m on my way to Ventura County, where the fire first began on Dec. 4 and from where it would eventually grow into the fifth largest in state history over the week that followed. Ventura is an iconic place, a once rugged beach town known for its citrus fruit farming and local surf spots, so often overshadowed by its big neighbor, Los Angeles. By the time I got there, a grey haze had once again settled over the county, and smoke filled the air. To the east, a massive fire was rapidly spreading, producing a thick brown smoke cloud that reached all the way north, to Santa Barbara County. Firefighters and firetrucks peppered the landscape, racing toward the still active sections of the blaze while other rigs drove further up the coast. A pizza delivery driver wore a dust mask to keep some of the smoke out of his lungs as he carried on with his day. I made it to Ojai Valley by afternoon. Melted wires from burned telephone poles drooped low or lay tangled on the ground. New smoke from spot fires still burned on the side of the road of State Route 150. In the valley, the smoke smelled of campfires and asphalt, where areas had been blackened in the days before. I could feel the heat through my clothes where hot spots still burned or smoldered. A town of 7,500 in the Topatopa Mountains, Ojai is world famous for its wine, nearby hiking trails, art galleries and new age shops. The fire had come dangerously close in the first days, but, for now, the small town had been spared from the worst of the blaze.Now, three massive plumes of smoke surrounded the valley, growing larger by the minute. Dozens of smaller smoke trails caused by spot fires scattered across the landscape were an ominous sign. Who knew whether they would grow larger, too. I stepped onto the embankment to take a photo of part of a ranch that had burned and collapsed, and I sunk into six inches of white ash. The path of destruction the fire had left in the area was dramatic and erratic. Some ranches were burned to the ground, leaving a stone chimney standing, a charred bathtub, and a burned out car with melted tires and windows. Others, often just directly adjacent, looked pristine ― trees still green, horses and cows eating in their pens.Further down the road, department of transportation officials chopped down a tree that looked like it was burning from the inside. Others mounted new telephone poles to replace the burned ones. Firefighters were everywhere ― on almost every street, at the restaurant, the gas station ― loading up their trucks for the next fight. More than 8,000 are currently deployed fighting fires in Southern California. Here in Ojai, they had come from counties up and down the coast. Signs praising the firefighters’ work were everywhere in the valley. “You kick ash,” one read, “We love our firefighters,” another said. Driving further north, an even thicker layer of haze surrounded the car. The cloud stretched out from the growing fire in the Santa Ynez Mountains to U.S. 101, onto the valleys, onto the quaint towns that coastal California is known for. Through the haze, dozens of palm trees still stood at a tree farm on the shoreline at Faria Beach ― long a landmark among commuters along the stretch ― but their leaves were burned off, their trunks blackened and scorched. This scene marked the entrance to an area where the fires were still very much active. Dead and dying cactus were left on the scorched hillsides next to U.S. 101, shriveled and brown. Each mile further north, the smoke-filled skies became darker. Whatever sunlight could penetrate through was a deep orange and red ― as if the sun was setting, all day long. The dense smoke enveloped the iconic beaches ― Mussel Shoals, Rincon Point, Carpinteria State Beach ― and drifted out over the ocean for what looked like miles. Surfers ― ever dedicated and undeterred ― peppered the large swells that rolled in, filling their lungs with smoke.In the sleepy beach communities of Carpinteria, Summerland and Montecito, chunks of ash ― former trees, homes, photographs, memories ― rained down. The overhanging smoke was denser, blacker than in the south. For some locals here, dust masks weren’t enough, with many wearing respirator masks instead. A thin layer of white ash lined the streets and sidewalks in the surrounding neighborhoods. Parked on a ridge across the valley in Summerland in the late afternoon, I watched the flames leaping high off of the Santa Ynez Mountains, devouring dry trees and plants. Smoke poured off of the hillsides. After 30 minutes, my shoulders and head were coated with ash. My eyes stung as the ash drifted into them.As night set in, locals gathered on hillsides, sat on top of their cars or rooftops, and watched as the fire continued to creep closer and devastate the land they call home. Planes and helicopters dropped red fire retardant to slow the blaze. The sun finally set. The sky turned orange, then dark red, then black, and then orange again ― but not from sunlight. It was fire light, which lit up the coast for miles. "

Tom Wolf plans to veto a highly restrictive abortion bill passed by the state's legislature.,2017-12-13,"Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf (D) speaks during the Geisinger National Symposium, ""From Crisis to Cure: Revitalizing America's Healthcare System,"" on Nov. 9 in Danville, Pennsylvania.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a319ae01500001f0049b89a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf (D) has reaffirmed his intention to veto a highly controversial bill passed by his state’s Republican-controlled legislature to restrict abortions after 20 weeks. The ban, known as Senate Bill 3, passed in the state’s House on Tuesday night, 121-70, after passing the state Senate back in February, 32-18.“This bill is an attack on women, and it should never have reached my desk,” Wolf said in a tweet posted Wednesday. “I will veto it, because all Pennsylvania women deserve to make their own health care decisions.”Support for the bill in both chambers of the state legislature was just shy of a veto-proof majority.SB3 represents “the most extreme restrictions” on abortion in the country, according to Planned Parenthood. Pennsylvania currently allows abortions up to the 24-week mark. SB3 would roll back that limit, allowing abortions after 20 weeks only in rare emergency situations, with no exception for cases of rape, incest or fetal abnormalities. The measure would also criminalize a certain medically accepted abortion procedure known as “dilation and evacuation,” although SB3 refers to it as “dismemberment abortion.” Were the bill to become law, Pennsylvania would become one of nearly 20 states that have laws banning abortion after 20 weeks ― but experts say the so-called “dismemberment” ban is unprecedented.In a statement issued Tuesday, the governor called SB3 an “an assault on the doctor-patient relationship by politicians without medical or health expertise.”“We’ve got to keep politics out of the doctor’s office,” Wolf told HuffPost in March, after holding events with doctors and women who have had the same kind of late-term abortions that would be restricted if the bill became law.“When people are choosing where to go to school or begin their professional lives or where to start their business or family, Pennsylvania has got to show that it’s open to them,” he continued. “This bill just says the reverse, that you can’t make your own decisions here, this is not a place where we value freedom of conscience.”Supporters of the bill argue that 20 weeks is the threshold at which a fetus can begin to feel pain, a statement debated by doctors.The bill’s opponents ― a group that includes the Pennsylvania Medical Society ― argue that some fetal abnormalities are only discovered after the 20-week mark, while others fear that such bans aim to erode Roe v. Wade."

Fans of the film responded enthusiastically, too. Whether the film’s deliciously campy opening number, “I See Me,” will make the leap from the screen to the stage remains to be seen.Similarly, the word’s still out on who will play Helen Sharp.

Jones’ unexpected victory means Republicans’ margin of control in the Senate will narrow. GOP leaders may try to push through their tax plan before Jones is seated.Democrats are calling on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to seat Jones quickly, but McConnell indicated on Tuesday that the new senator will not be sworn in during the current session, which ends Dec. 22. Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill (R) said the earliest he can certify the election results is Dec. 26. The latest the state can certify the results is Jan. 3.In 2010, Sekulow wrote that it was “outrageous” for then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) to wait for the results of Brown’s election to be certified before seating him in the Senate. He accused Democrats of disenfranchising Massachusetts voters, and his organization, the American Center for Law and Justice, threatened to sue.″There’s absolutely no reason to wait to seat Senator-elect Brown and with each passing day he is prevented from participating in the legislative process,” Sekulow wrote less than a week after Scott’s electoral victory. “This delay tactic along with reports that top Democrats continue to plot passage of health care reform show that its business as usual in Washington ignoring the will of Massachusetts voters and moving forward with a disturbing health care plan that America simply does not want.”Sekulow did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday.When Brown was elected, Reid said that Senate Democrats would halt work on the Affordable Care Act until Brown arrived. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) cited that precedent on Wednesday when he called for Republicans to delay a vote on their tax bill. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, called the idea of slowing down a vote “laughable.”Brown was sworn in as a senator 16 days after his election."

Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio) said in a meeting with other lawmakers on Wednesday that the way some of her female colleagues dressed was “an invitation” to sexual harassment, Politico reports.“I saw a member yesterday with her cleavage so deep it was down to the floor,” Kaptur said at a Democratic caucus meeting about sexual harassment, other people at the gathering told Politico. “And what I’ve seen … it’s really an invitation.” “Maybe I’ll get booed for saying this, but many companies and the military [have] a dress code,” she continued. “I have been appalled at some of the dress of ... members and staff. Men have to wear ties and suits.”In a statement to reporters explaining her comments later on Wednesday, Kaptur suggested she never meant to blame the victim for being harassed.“When I was first elected to Congress my office and I became a refuge for female staffers who had been mistreated by their bosses. Some of them in tears many days. It is something I carry with me to this day and something I brought up during our Caucus meeting. Under no circumstances is it the victim’s fault if they are harassed in any way,” Kaptur said in the statement.However, she also doubled down on the idea that a dress code could reduce harassment. “I shared the stories from my time here in the context of the ‘Me Too’ legislation and how we can elevate the decorum and the dress code to protect women from what is a pervasive problem here and in society at large,” Kaptur said. When HuffPost asked Kaptur’s office if she thought calling for a dress code “to protect women” still placed the onus on women to dress a certain way to, in theory, avoid being sexually abused, her office referred HuffPost back to the portion of her statement saying it was never the victim’s fault.Kaptur, now in her 17th term, is currently the longest serving woman in the House. She was one of more than 50 Democratic congresswomen who signed a letter Tuesday calling for Congress to investigate the sexual misconduct allegations against President Donald Trump. Late Wednesday, women’s advocacy group UltraViolet pushed back on Kaptur’s explanation of her comments ― specifically calling out her reiteration that a dress code may help protect women from harassment. “Rep. Kaptur, hear us loud and clear: no one deserves sexual harassment, no one asks for it, and the only people to blame for it are the harassers themselves,” UltraViolet co-founder Nita Chaudhary said in a statement. “By blaming victims — not once, but twice today — Kaptur is protecting sexual abusers, not the survivors who are silenced and disparaged by the very institution in which they work every day. Kaptur is wrong and she needs to do better.”In October, another Democratic congresswoman, Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas, also made headlines for similarly blaming sexual harassment in part on the way women dress.“I grew up in a time when it was as much the woman’s responsibility as it was a man’s — how you were dressed, what your behavior was,” Johnson told a Texas NBC affiliate when asked about the allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.“I’m from the old school that you can have behaviors that appear to be inviting. It can be interpreted as such. That’s the responsibility, I think, of the female,” she said.These comments come as women across multiple industries, including politics, have been calling out sexual misconduct by men in the workplace, as part of the #MeToo movement. Last month at a congressional hearing, several female lawmakers testified about instances of sexual harassment involving other lawmakers or staff.This article has been updated with comment from Chaudhary.

55,POLITICS,The First Felony Trial Of Trump Inauguration Protesters Is About To Go To A Jury,Ryan J. Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/j20-inauguration-trial-jury-felony_us_5a30674ce4b07ff75afe970a,"A judge dismissed just one of the felony charges against six defendants on Wednesday, leaving them exposed to potential lengthy prison sentences.",2017-12-13,Britt Lawson is on trial for several felonies in connection with her arrest during the inauguration. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a3067b9150000490049b58e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― A judge overseeing the jury trial of six individuals facing felony charges for non-violent conduct during a protest of President Donald Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration acquitted all six of a single felony count of inciting a riot on Wednesday. But D.C. Superior Court Judge Lynn Leibovitz declined to issue a judgement of acquittal on any of the other seven charges, instead ruling that a jury will be able to hear the seven remaining charges, including five felonies.Out of the presence of the jury, Judge Lynn Leibovitz issued a judgement of acquittal as to the inciting charge on Wednesday morning, the day after the prosecution and all six defense teams rested their cases. Leibovitz found that no reasonable jury could find that any of the defendants intended to urge a riot, stating that she believed the inciter had to be someone who was deliberately causing others to act.The bad news for defendants came in the afternoon. Judge Leibovitz declined to issue a judgement of acquittal for any of the remaining charges, including two misdemeanor charges for engaging in a riot and conspiracy to riot, and five felony counts of property destruction, which the defendants would be held liable for if found to have engaged in the rioting conspiracy.The prosecution, led by Assistant U.S. Attorney Jennifer Kerkhoff, has conceded that none of the voluminous evidence in this case indicates that any of these six defendants engaged in any property destruction or violence on Jan. 20. The six individuals currently on trial were among more than 200 individuals arrested en masse that day by the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department after individuals within a large group of mostly black-clad demonstrators smashed windows in downtown D.C. ahead of Trump’s swearing-in. Police conduct that day has come under scrutiny, and the chief detective in the case is a police union official who had tweeted disparagingly about activists.The trial, which opened on Nov. 20, is being prosecuted by attorneys from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia. In D.C., the types of crimes that would typically be prosecuted by local prosecutors are instead prosecuted by federal prosecutors who take their cases before D.C. Superior Court judges who are appointed by U.S. presidents.Kerkhoff argued on Wednesday that Alexei Wood, a photographer who has been charged in the case, was giving “energy” and “encouragement” to those who were destroying property. “This is more than just tacit approval,” Kerkhoff said of comments and expressions that Wood made during a livestream of the event. “This is very expressive, active encouragement.”Kerkhoff said she was focused on his conduct, not “whether he believes he was a journalist or not,” and argued that the presence of cameras can “influence ... conduct.” She said Wood was almost giving “PR” ― meaning public relations ― by broadcasting a Facebook livestream that was only being watched by two views at one point. Judge Leibovitz heard lawyers for each defendant argue why their case should be tossed before it got to the jury. Leibovitz apparently bought into the theory that “street medics” could be aiding and abetting a riot if they “remained there to assist” any rioters. At one point, Leibovitz compared street medics to a “getaway driver” who could still be part of the conspiracy, even if the robbers didn’t use the getaway driver’s service and instead, for example, took a bus.They were discussing the case against Britt Lawson, a nurse from Pittsburgh who treated cancer patients until she was forced to quit her job to deal with her trial.On Tuesday, Lawson’s former boss, Valerie Hess, flew into D.C. from California, where she was on vacation, to testify about her dealings with Lawson. When Hess started explaining how “oncology patients are super special,” the government objected. When she was asked whether Lawson had been a good nurse, the government objected. Hess was allowed to tell the jury that Lawson responded to aggressive patients calmly.“I have not experienced her to be violent in any capacity,” Hess testified. On Wednesday, Judge Leibovitz seemed concerned that Lawson seemed “entirely nonplussed by some pretty serious violence” happening around her. “I guess it’s just another day at the office?” Leibovitz said.Leibovitz called the masks worn by defendants “pretty forbidding,” and said that while black clothing didn’t make for a riot, wearing black clothing could be seen as an indication that an individual knew of plans for a demonstration and was seeking to hide their face. In all cases, Judge Leibovitz said she was satisfied that a reasonable juror could conclude that a riot was occurring and conclude that the defendants engaged in a conspiracy to riot. Both sides will likely make their closing arguments to the jury on Thursday. Ryan Reilly is HuffPost’s senior justice reporter, covering criminal justice, federal law enforcement and legal affairs.

58,GREEN,Here's Why It's So Difficult To Control California's Wildfires,David Lohr,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/control-california-wildfires_us_5a3120a0e4b07ff75aff27ed,"""A lot of people want to live in the country … without understanding the risk.""",2017-12-13,"A firefighter battles a house fire as the Woolsey Fire burns in Oak Park, a community in Southern California, early Friday morning.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5be9c4012600000503847a61.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"California’s Camp fire is the deadliest inferno to hit California in 85 years. It’s being blamed for the deaths of more than two dozen people, the destruction of nearly 7,000 structures and the forced evacuation of 250,000 people.Officials estimate the Camp fire has blackened approximately 113,000 acres since Nov. 8, with 31 confirmed deaths and at least 200 people missing in fire zones in Northern California. According to officials, the Camp fire now matches the Griffith Park Fire of 1933 as the deadliest wildfire in the state’s history.The fire, only 25 percent contained, threatens an additional 15,500 structures as of Monday.Some 4,500 firefighters have been battling the blaze, an effort that has reached a cost of $16 million, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.In addition to strong winds and dry foliage, human error can contribute to a fire’s damage, experts say.Roads become congested with people waiting to evacuate, causing fleeing residents to tangle with emergency responders trying to get in. Cars abandoned by frustrated drivers add to that problem.In a previous interview with HuffPost, James McMullen, a retired California chief fire marshal, said strong winds can cause a fire to blow like a blast furnace.“They can burn so fast and furious that they will incinerate trees,” McMullen said. “I’ve personally seen where these fires have incinerated pine trees up to 50 feet high ― nothing but blackened branches, and at the top a full-blown Christmas tree. It’s a remarkable thing to see.”Following some basic guidelines can ensure the personal safety of residents and firefighters, however.“In California, you have to take precautionary measures,” McMullen said.The “most important thing” a homeowner in a fire-prone area can do “is have a defensible, fire-safe landscape,” said McMullen, now president of The McMullen Company, a fire protection consulting firm. “Remove the natural vegetation and replace it with ornamental fire-resistant vegetation and keep it back 100 feet.”Construction materials should also be fire-resistant, he said.“People love huge decks and tend to build them out of combustible materials, like pine,” McMullen said. “Then they load them with other combustible materials, like chaise lounges and barbecue grills with propane tanks. All of that will burn.”“We recommend houses in communities that are subject to wildland fires have fire-retardant roofs and siding,” he added. “Attic access vents should be no more than a quarter inch in diameter to prevent embers from floating in.”According to McMullen, firefighters may choose not to defend houses that are completely surrounded by vegetation during a wildfire.“It’s too dangerous, so they’ll look at the next house, and if it has 100 feet of defensible space, they’ll defend that one,” he said.Experts say it’s important to prepare for an evacuation, readying pets and gathering medications and important papers. Residents should stack lawn furniture away from the residence and turn on all the lights to illuminate the home. Fires can cause blackout conditions even during daylight, and lights help firefighters identify the location of houses.Time is of the essence, Contra Costa County Fire Capt. George Laing told HuffPost late last year during the Thomas fire, which affected Ventura and Santa Barbara counties and burned approximately 281,893 acres.“It’s very important for people to leave even before the evacuation order is given,” Laing said. “Often, people will say, ‘No, I’m not leaving.’ Then they’ll get scared and leave too late, and that’s where they’re in danger of getting burned over. Those people will attempt to drive through flames, or try to find shelter. We’ve even heard stories of people who got into swimming pools. But at that point, it’s already too late.”Mike Driscoll, senior vice president of the fire and explosion division at the private firm Envista Forensics, advised people who encounter wildfire while driving to “remain inside their vehicle with the engine running, windows up and ventilation system closed to the interior of the vehicle, until the fire moves beyond the vehicle’s location.”Laing, a former fire prevention technician and inspector, warned that radiant heat is a big danger for those who get too close to a fire.“It is possible for vehicles to ignite if they get too close,” Laing said. “Fire can be very intensely hot, and radiant heat can cause tires to burn and alloys to melt. If you are in those conditions, you are really in a bad spot, and if you pull off the road, that’s it. You’re done.”Firefighters estimate they’ll be able to contain the Camp fire by Nov. 30. The fire’s cause is still under investigation.According to McMullen and Laing, massive wildfires like last year’s Thomas fire have been increasing in frequency and duration because of global warming.“We’re seeing hotter times than we’ve seen in the past,” McMullen said. “Temperatures have risen, and you can see where climates have changed. I’ve been around a long time, and I’ve fought fires for many years, and I can tell you that this type of fire in December is something I’ve never experienced before.”Laing said the effects of climate change are obvious.“These cycles of drought, combined with drought-stressed trees and bumper crops of fuel, create these kinds of intense fires,” he said. “Fires, in particular, seem to indicate the trends are serious.”Fires also take an emotional toll on survivors.“You just sit here in a fog and think you’re going to wake up,” Shawna Howard, a Paradise resident, told The Associated Press.Howard said fire and flames lined both sides of the roadway when she fled the area with her 12-year-old daughter.Greg Woodcox, 58, told the Houston Chronicle he was wracked with guilt that he was unable to save a close friend, the man’s mother and three others he witnessed die when flames overtook their vehicle in Butte County on Sunday.“I’m in shock,” said a tearful Woodcox. “Those poor souls. I tried to get them out, but we were trapped like rats.”For more information on fire preparation, visit the American Red Cross Prepare SoCal website, which provides valuable tips for responding to life-threatening wildfires.

The bombing has been in the news recently because of Doug Jones, who prosecuted two of the Ku Klux Klan members responsible for the attack.On Tuesday night, Alabama voters elected Jones to the U.S. Senate, in a surprise victory.Other more mainstream films entering the registry this year include Christopher Nolan’s “Memento,” a cerebral thriller whose story is told non-linearly; “Field of Dreams,” the 1989 baseball drama with Kevin Costner; and the kid classic “The Goonies.”Historians and curators at the Library of Congress have chosen 725 films for the registry since it began in 1989. They also solicit recommendations from the public.The full list of 2017 inductees is below:“Ace in the Hole (aka Big Carnival)” (1951)“Boulevard Nights” (1979)“Die Hard” (1988)“Dumbo” (1941)“Field of Dreams” (1989)“4 Little Girls” (1997) “Fuentes Family Home Movies Collection” (1920s and 1930s)“Gentleman’s Agreement” (1947)“The Goonies” (1985)“Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner” (1967)“He Who Gets Slapped” (1924)“Interior New York Subway, 14th Street to 42nd Street” (1905)“La Bamba” (1987)“Lives of Performers” (1972)“Memento” (2000)“Only Angels Have Wings” (1939)“The Sinking of the Lusitania” (1918)“Spartacus” (1960)“Superman” (1978)“Thelonious Monk: Straight, No Chaser” (1988)“Time and Dreams” (1976)“Titanic” (1997)“To Sleep with Anger” (1990)“Wanda” (1971)“With the Abraham Lincoln Brigade in Spain” (1937-1938)"

According to a recent report from Variety, viewers are “flocking” to the morning show since Lauer’s sudden departure in November after multiple women accused the veteran journalist of sexual misconduct. “Today” beat out rival ABC’s “Good Morning America” in the ratings two weeks in a row ― the first two-week winning streak for “Today” since December 2016.The “Today” show had an average of 1.64 million viewers ages 25-54 for the week ending on Dec. 8, and averaged a whopping 4.58 million viewers overall, Variety reports. “Good Morning America” had an average of 1.38 million viewers ages 25-54 in the same time period, and an overall average of 4.38 million.For comparison, in the week of Nov. 13, “Today” averaged 1.46 million viewers ages 25-54 and 4.23 million viewers overall.At the same time, Adweek notes that “Today,” “Good Morning America” and “CBS This Morning” were all down in viewers last week compared to where the three shows were a year before.Currently, Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb are co-hosting the morning show, with Kotb taking Lauer’s old spot. Lauer was an anchor for the “Today” show for two decades.In a statement released Nov. 30, Lauer responded to the allegations against him.“There are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions. To the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry,” Lauer’s statement said in part. “Some of what is being said about me is untrue or mischaracterized, but there is enough truth in these stories to make me feel embarrassed and ashamed.”Maybe people prefer anchors who are not sexual predators, or maybe people simply prefer women. Here’s hoping it’s both. "

White evangelical Christians, longtime supporters of Jones’ Republican opponent Roy Moore, decided en masse to stand by their man.According to exit polling conducted by Edison Research, 80 percent of white voters who self-identified as born-again or evangelical Christians voted for the former judge. About 18 percent voted for Jones, while another 2 percent chose to write in a candidate.About 76 percent of everyone else ― those who didn’t identify as white evangelical Christian ― voted for Jones.A small number of evangelicals appeared to sit out the election. Evangelicals claimed 44 percent of the total vote in Alabama, The Washington Post reports, even though they made up 47 percent of voters in the 2012 and 2008 presidential elections.Overall, white evangelical support for Moore in Alabama stayed strong ― despite sexual assault allegations that threatened to damage his reputation in national evangelical circles. The exit poll results echoed the overwhelming loyalty that white evangelical Christians across the nation showed the Republican Party during the 2016 election, when about 81 percent voted for President Donald Trump.Moore has been a favorite of white evangelicals in his state for quite some time. He’s earned a reputation of being a Christian nationalist, someone who believes that America is a Christian nation favored by God, and that the government should advocate Christian, or more specifically, conservative Christian, values. Moore’s belief that God’s law trumps secular law fuels his approach toward governing, and has gotten him in legal trouble multiple times in the past. He was booted from his post as Alabama’s chief justice twice for refusing to follow federal laws that he believed contradicted his religious beliefs. Rev. Carolyn Foster, a deacon at St. Mark’s Episcopal Church in Birmingham, was one of dozens of progressive Christian ministers in Alabama who signed a letter in November opposing Moore’s candidacy.On Wednesday, Foster told HuffPost that she believed the white evangelical voters who supported Moore during the election were “blind and deaf” to their own unconscious bias. “Roy Moore represented to them a time long past ― when blacks and women knew their place and Latinos and Muslims were not even in their sphere of existence,” Foster told HuffPost in an email. “This type of exclusionary and oppressive form of Christianity distorts the witness of the Church to love neighbor as self. Faith is about attaining love, peace and justice together and never at the expense of another.”Adam Mixon, pastor of the Zion Spring Baptist Church in Birmingham, signed the letter opposing Moore. He said he believed Republicans were compromising their claim of being the party of “family values.” “Family values seem not to matter as much as the present conservative agenda. Deep spirituality and faithfulness seem to have been set aside for a pragmatic, ‘win-at-all-cost’ approach,” Mixon told HuffPost in an email. “Whatever leverage white evangelicals may have waged with their appeal to ‘family values’ has been damaged and their witness is bereft of any real consistency.”The unwavering support of Alabama’s white evangelicals, particularly after the emergence of sexual assault allegations against Moore, has troubled some national leaders. In an editorial written before the election, Mark Galli, editor-in-chief of the faith-based publication Christianity Today, stated that no matter the outcome, the biggest loser in the race would be the Christian faith itself. “When it comes to either matters of life and death or personal commitments of the human heart, no one will believe a word we say, perhaps for a generation. Christianity’s integrity is severely tarnished,” Galli wrote.Christian commentator Peter Wehner wrote that the support many Republicans and white evangelicals were giving to Trump and Moore has caused him to rethink his identification with both groups. “Not because my attachment to conservatism and Christianity has weakened, but rather the opposite,” he wrote in an op-ed for The New York Times. “I consider Mr. Trump’s Republican Party to be a threat to conservatism, and I have concluded that the term evangelical — despite its rich history of proclaiming the ‘good news’ of Christ to a broken world — has been so distorted that it is now undermining the Christian witness.”Although polls demonstrated white evangelical Christians’ loyalty to Moore and to the Republican Party, black Christians had a decidedly different take. Exit polls found that black evangelical Christians voted similarly to black Alabamians overall. About 95 percent of black evangelicals voted for Jones, while 98 percent of black non-evangelicals did the same, according to The Washington Post. Mixon said that black Baptists in his state tended to be very conservative morally and religiously, but progressive on political issues. He compared black Christians in his state to prophets in the Bible who, because of their position at the margins of society, had a better and clearer view of its ills. “I believe this is the gift and the burden that black Christians and other Christians of color have been forced to bear for the duration of our national past,” he wrote. “Our suffering has proven redemptive for a nation that has often failed to live up to its creed ― that all people are created equal!

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a31aea21600002100c4fd24.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Doug Jones’ victory in Alabama’s special Senate election Tuesday night upset the status quo in his state in many ways ― it put a Democrat from Alabama in the U.S. Senate for the first time in 25 years, and it showed off the political clout of Alabama’s black voters.But amid the tumult of the special election, one thing did not change. White evangelical Christians, longtime supporters of Jones’ Republican opponent Roy Moore, decided en masse to stand by their man.According to exit polling conducted by Edison Research, 80 percent of white voters who self-identified as born-again or evangelical Christians voted for the former judge. About 18 percent voted for Jones, while another 2 percent chose to write in a candidate.About 76 percent of everyone else ― those who didn’t identify as white evangelical Christian ― voted for Jones.A small number of evangelicals appeared to sit out the election. Evangelicals claimed 44 percent of the total vote in Alabama, The Washington Post reports, even though they made up 47 percent of voters in the 2012 and 2008 presidential elections.Overall, white evangelical support for Moore in Alabama stayed strong ― despite sexual assault allegations that threatened to damage his reputation in national evangelical circles. The exit poll results echoed the overwhelming loyalty that white evangelical Christians across the nation showed the Republican Party during the 2016 election, when about 81 percent voted for President Donald Trump.Moore has been a favorite of white evangelicals in his state for quite some time. He’s earned a reputation of being a Christian nationalist, someone who believes that America is a Christian nation favored by God, and that the government should advocate Christian, or more specifically, conservative Christian, values. Moore’s belief that God’s law trumps secular law fuels his approach toward governing, and has gotten him in legal trouble multiple times in the past. He was booted from his post as Alabama’s chief justice twice for refusing to follow federal laws that he believed contradicted his religious beliefs. Rev. Carolyn Foster, a deacon at St. Mark’s Episcopal Church in Birmingham, was one of dozens of progressive Christian ministers in Alabama who signed a letter in November opposing Moore’s candidacy.On Wednesday, Foster told HuffPost that she believed the white evangelical voters who supported Moore during the election were “blind and deaf” to their own unconscious bias. “Roy Moore represented to them a time long past ― when blacks and women knew their place and Latinos and Muslims were not even in their sphere of existence,” Foster told HuffPost in an email. “This type of exclusionary and oppressive form of Christianity distorts the witness of the Church to love neighbor as self. Faith is about attaining love, peace and justice together and never at the expense of another.”Adam Mixon, pastor of the Zion Spring Baptist Church in Birmingham, signed the letter opposing Moore. He said he believed Republicans were compromising their claim of being the party of “family values.” “Family values seem not to matter as much as the present conservative agenda. Deep spirituality and faithfulness seem to have been set aside for a pragmatic, ‘win-at-all-cost’ approach,” Mixon told HuffPost in an email. “Whatever leverage white evangelicals may have waged with their appeal to ‘family values’ has been damaged and their witness is bereft of any real consistency.”The unwavering support of Alabama’s white evangelicals, particularly after the emergence of sexual assault allegations against Moore, has troubled some national leaders. In an editorial written before the election, Mark Galli, editor-in-chief of the faith-based publication Christianity Today, stated that no matter the outcome, the biggest loser in the race would be the Christian faith itself. “When it comes to either matters of life and death or personal commitments of the human heart, no one will believe a word we say, perhaps for a generation. Christianity’s integrity is severely tarnished,” Galli wrote.Christian commentator Peter Wehner wrote that the support many Republicans and white evangelicals were giving to Trump and Moore has caused him to rethink his identification with both groups. “Not because my attachment to conservatism and Christianity has weakened, but rather the opposite,” he wrote in an op-ed for The New York Times. “I consider Mr. Trump’s Republican Party to be a threat to conservatism, and I have concluded that the term evangelical — despite its rich history of proclaiming the ‘good news’ of Christ to a broken world — has been so distorted that it is now undermining the Christian witness.”Although polls demonstrated white evangelical Christians’ loyalty to Moore and to the Republican Party, black Christians had a decidedly different take. Exit polls found that black evangelical Christians voted similarly to black Alabamians overall. About 95 percent of black evangelicals voted for Jones, while 98 percent of black non-evangelicals did the same, according to The Washington Post. Mixon said that black Baptists in his state tended to be very conservative morally and religiously, but progressive on political issues. He compared black Christians in his state to prophets in the Bible who, because of their position at the margins of society, had a better and clearer view of its ills. “I believe this is the gift and the burden that black Christians and other Christians of color have been forced to bear for the duration of our national past,” he wrote. “Our suffering has proven redemptive for a nation that has often failed to live up to its creed ― that all people are created equal! We are the canaries in the mines.”Foster said that black voters’ presence at the polls on Tuesday should be a “wake up call” for Alabama.“Black Christians rose up and said, ‘No more.’ They made the difference in this election,” Foster wrote. “Blacks have always found strength in the church. That strength showed up at the polls and I believe will continue to move out into the community in the days ahead.”This article has been updated with comments from Adam Mixon."
63,POLITICS,"Patagonia Hits Back Against Trump Administration, House GOP Attacks",Alexander C. Kaufman and Chris D'Angelo,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/patagonia-trump-bears-ears_us_5a2ab0ffe4b073789f6935ae,The company dismissed criticism for manufacturing overseas and called out White House ties to a uranium mining company.,2017-12-12,"The twin rock formations that make up Bears Ears National Monument in Utah on May 16, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a2f25ab1600004700c4f59a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Patagonia dismissed Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke’s efforts to knock the company as “Patagonia made in China” on Monday, saying the Trump administration is trying to deflect from its unpopular decision to open up huge chunks of protected land to potential industrial development, including uranium mining.A fierce opponent of the Trump administration’s monthslong review of monuments designated under the Antiquities Act of 1906, Patagonia is now part of a coalition that’s suing to block a White House proposal to reduce the boundaries of a 1.35 million-acre Bears Ears National Monument in Utah by 85 percent. On Friday, The Washington Post published documents detailing a uranium company’s lobbying campaign to scale back Bears Ears. The company ― Energy Fuels Resources (USA) Inc., a subsidiary of a Canadian firm ― said eliminating large portions of the monument would give it easier access to the area’s radioactive ore and help it expand a nearby uranium processing mill.“For almost this entire year, the administration has claimed that this was not about opening up these lands for the extractive industries,” Hans Cole, Patagonia’s director of environmental campaigns and advocacy, wrote in an email to HuffPost on Monday. “But from the Washington Post reporting, it seems clear that the uranium industry lobbied hard to reduce the size of the monument, underlying our long-held concern that if protections for these lands are taken away, they will be drilled, mined and fracked.”The Interior Department did not respond to a request for comment on Monday about the Washington Post report.Patagonia, a privately held, Ventura, California-based firm, poured money into Bears Ears since then-President Barack Obama designated the monument last December. In April, the company took the unusual step of threatening to sue the Trump administration if it altered Bears Ears.The firm ― which does not report sales figures but said in March that it’s “approaching $1 billion” ― donated more than $89 million to environmental groups, and “has invested substantial company resources to amplify their message, using its own marketing platforms and employee time to advocate for their shared conservation goals,” according to the lawsuit filed last week. After Trump signed a pair of proclamations to dismantle Bears Ears and another protected site, Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, last week, Patagonia redesigned its homepage to read “The President Stole Your Land” on a black background.The House Committee on Natural Resources responded by posting a similar image on Twitter last Friday that read, “Patagonia Is Lying To You ... A corporate giant hijacking our public lands debate to sell more products to wealthy elitist urban dwellers from New York to San Francisco.”Walter Shaub, the former director of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, said the “attack” on Patagonia “sure looks a lot like a violation” of House committee rules on social media communication.In its Friday email newsletter, the House committee included the subject line “The Source (Patagonia: don’t buy it)”, which some saw as a call to boycott the company. Ben Goldey, the committee’s digital director, denied the accusation, insisting “nobody is calling for a boycott.” Either way, Patagonia said it won’t file an ethics complaint, and instead plans to stay focused on blocking the president’s decision on Bears Ears.“It was obviously inappropriate, but we are staying focused on protecting our national monuments,” Corley Kenna, a Patagonia spokeswoman, told HuffPost. That may require digging in for a prolonged, public feud with Zinke. The 56-year-old interior secretary is one of the most prolific and ostentatious social media users in Trump’s Cabinet, and a vocal defender of the president. Asked about Patagonia during a press call on Tuesday, Zinke said, “You mean Patagonia made in China? This is an example of a special interest.”Zinke then railed against the company in two separate appearances on Fox News last week. In a Tuesday interview with “Fox & Friends,” the former Montana congressman said, “Well, it’s interesting, you know, these companies that make their products other places, on foreign shores, and special interest groups.” And on Friday, Zinke told Fox Business that Patagonia was pushing out “shameless lies” about what the monument rollback does. “There’s not one square inch, not one square inch, of land that is removed from federal protection,” he said, adding that Patagonia “should focus on how to bring manufacturing back into the country instead of lying to the public about losing federal land.” Founded in 1973, Patagonia has more than 30 locations across the country, including a major distribution center in Reno, Nevada, and employs more than 1,000 people in the U.S. It donates a percentage of its profits to environmental causes and says it is actively working to reduce its footprint. It is also transparent about where its products are manufactured. “We cannot make a claim to be a ‘Made in America’ company; we have always sourced at least half our products outside the U.S.,” the company writes on its website.Patagonia encourages “anyone who is interested in how our clothing is sourced to visit our website, where we thoroughly demonstrate our ethical standards,” company spokeswoman Kenna told HuffPost. “It’s too bad we don’t get the same transparency and commitment to people and the planet out of this administration,” Kenna added. While Trump and his Cabinet continue to push his “buy American, hire American” rhetoric, much of the merchandise the Trump family sells — from ties to chandeliers — is made overseas, including in China, Mexico and Bangladesh, as HuffPost has previously reported. Last year, The Washington Post reported that Trump’s products were manufactured in at least 12 foreign countries (Bangladesh, China, Germany, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Slovenia, South Korea, Turkey and Vietnam).That hasn’t kept Zinke, or his wife Lola, from ripping Patagonia. “Patagonia made in China?” Lola wrote in a Twitter post. “Huh, why don’t they bring their factories home and pay good wages???” When one Twitter user asked if she recognized how “ignorant” the question was, given who is in the White House, Lola responded: “the business first, America first president!? No, the question is valid.”Patagonia has stayed on the offensive, however. Last week, the company criticized Zinke for his use of private jets. “It’s odd that @SecretaryZinke has no problem with special interests when they’re paying for his private jets,” the company posted to Twitter. “We have been fighting for these lands for decades, so that hunters, fisherman, hikers and everyone else can use them and help us protect them.” Zinke is among several people in Trump’s Cabinet who have faced backlash in recent months over their use of private planes. In September, it was revealed that Zinke and several staffers had chartered an oil company plane for a flight from Nevada to Montana in June, costing taxpayers $12,375. He has since acknowledged using a private plane on three separate occasions, including the trip to Montana. But during an energy speech at the conservative Heritage Foundation, he shrugged off the controversy as “a little BS.”Politico reported Thursday that Zinke spent more than $14,000 in taxpayer money to use government helicopters to travel to and from Washington, D.C., this summer. That figure includes a $6,250 round-trip flight to go horseback riding in New York with Vice President Mike Pence."

Those charges were later dropped.The sexual misconduct allegations against the ex-players were detailed in an amended lawsuit filed in Los Angeles on Monday by Jami Cantor, a former wardrobe stylist at the NFL NetworkIn the complaint, first reported by Bloomberg News, Cantor accused Faulk of fondling her breasts and exposing his penis as he demanded oral sex. She said that Evans, a former fullback, sent nude pictures and made unwelcome propositions, and that Taylor, an ex-defensive back, sent her a video of him masturbating in the shower.“The supervisors knew about it, the supervisors observed it,” Cantor’s lawyer, Laura Horton, said, according to The New York Times. “It was insidious in this particular environment.”She alleged another man, former NFL Network executive Eric Weinberger, groped her and pushed his genitals against her. Weinberger has been suspended by his current company, The Ringer.The suit alleges McNabb, a longtime NFL quarterback, sent her lewd messages and that Davis, who played 13 seasons in the NFL as a defensive back, groped her. Both men most recently have been hosting radio shows for ESPN.Sapp, according to the suit, gave Cantor sex toys as Christmas gifts three years in a row and showed her nude photos of other women with whom he claimed to have had sexual relations. He also is in the NFL Hall of Fame.Cantor asserts that she was wrongfully terminated by the NFL Network, where she worked 10 years until her dismissal for allegedly stealing in 2016. Cantor, then 51, said she complained about the working conditions to no avail and was replaced by a woman 21 years younger than her.Cantor originally filed her suit in October."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a2f93851600004800cf0aa8.jpeg?cache=8VclUUXcFY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On Tuesday, the two-year anniversary of the adoption of the historic Paris Agreement, 50 world leaders planned to gather in the French capital to attend an invite-only climate change conference hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron, the World Bank and the United Nations. In attendance will be British Prime Minister Theresa May, Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, UN Secretary-General António Guterres and World Bank President Jim Yong Kim, among other global leaders and heads of state.There, however, will be one conspicuous absence: Donald Trump.Macron had said pointedly in November that he had not extended an invitation to Trump, who in June announced plans to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate accord. Macron said that he could be persuaded to change his mind about the invitation if Trump showed a willingness to “join the club” to fight global warming.As Time magazine noted on Monday, however, Trump has expressed little interest in shifting his climate change stance. His administration continues to champion fossil fuels and has actively taken steps to unravel policies enacted during former President Barack Obama’s tenure to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Tuesday’s conference, dubbed the One Planet Summit, aims to mobilize public and private financing to fund the global transition to a carbon-free future. Other than the 50 world leaders, 4,000 other participants and 800 organizations are expected to attend. Trump may not be attending the conference but other Americans will be there.California Gov. Jerry Brown, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former Secretary of State John Kerry are among the attendees.Arnold Schwarzenegger, the famed actor and former California governor, is also attending the summit, according to the Associated Press. The Austrian-American was quoted as saying this week that it doesn’t matter whether Trump is on board with the climate accord or not, “because companies, scientists and other governments can ‘pick up the slack’ to reduce global emissions.”Macron on Monday announced the recipients of new climate change grants proposed in the wake of Trump’s decision, dubbed his “Make Our Planet Great Again” program. The researchers, most of whom are U.S.-based, will now have the option to relocate to France to continue their research. Macron told the grant winners that France ""will be there to replace"" U.S. support for climate science."

The actual number is likely to be much higher, according to Amnesty.A recent video of an alleged modern-day slave auction in Libya, where African migrants were reportedly being sold for a few hundred dollars each, stoked international outrage and drew attention to the country’s critical state of instability. Although the auction was allegedly run by Libyan militias, a United Nations report from June found that the country’s coast guard and its Department to Counter Illegal Migration (DCIM) are “directly involved” in the enslavement of migrants.With ships, training and sustained funding from the EU, the Amnesty report said, Libya’s coast guard works to intercept refugees and migrants at sea. It returns them to detention centers across the country, where some 20,000 men, women and children are currently imprisoned.In these unsanitary, overcrowded centers, which are run by the DCIM, detainees allegedly endure “horrific” conditions and ill treatment, according to Amnesty. For many, the only escape is through illegal payments to guards and smugglers.In interviews with Amnesty, dozens of migrants and refugees described a system of collusion between guards, smugglers and the Libyan Coast Guard:Detention center guards regularly torture detainees to extort money, releasing those that can pay, and sometimes passing them on to smugglers who secure their departure from Libya in cooperation with the coast guard. Agreements between the coast guard and smugglers are signaled by markings on boats that allow specific vessels to pass through Libyan waters without interception, and the coast guard has also been known to escort boats out to international waters.“It’s like hell,” a former detainee told Amnesty, describing the camps. “You never see the light of the sun. You are closed in a room, locked, each with a toilet. Rooms are packed ― no space to sleep on the floor at the same time.”It’s unclear how many members of the coast guard collaborate with smugglers, Amnesty noted, but increased European support has enabled the coast guard to intercept more migrants over the past year. So far in 2017, it has captured 19,452 people en route to Europe and taken them to Libyan detention centers.Christopher Daniel, a 20-year-old Nigerian, was among a group of more than 150 migrants on a rubber boat stopped by the Libyan Coast Guard in November.“I suffered a lot ― kidnappings, demands for ransom,” he told Reuters of his failed journey to Italy. “I don’t know what to say or do. All the money I have wasted ― what will I tell my parents?”U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein called the situation “an outrage to the conscience of humanity” in a statement last month. “The European Union’s policy of assisting the Libyan coast guard to intercept and return migrants in the Mediterranean [is] inhuman,” he said.A review by the U.K. Independent Commission for Aid Impact sounded alarm back in March that the Libyan Coast Guard was “deliver[ing] migrants back to a system that leads to indiscriminate and indefinite detention and denies refugees their right to asylum.”But British officials have ignored such warnings “time and time again,” Amnesty asserted in its report.“By supporting the Libyan authorities in trapping people in Libya, without requiring the Libyan authorities to tackle the endemic abuse of refugees and migrants or to even recognize that refugees exist, European governments have shown where their true priorities lie: namely the closure of the central Mediterranean route, with scant regard to the suffering caused,” said John Dalhuisen, Amnesty’s Europe director. “They are complicit in these crimes.” "

Even when the canyon air filled with smoke, when the flames came rushing up, when darkness fell and the sky glowed red both behind and ahead of us. So, okay, it was a little scary. But we were just a short drive from Portland, Oregon, on a well-traveled trail my family had hiked a dozen times in the last 10 years. No one dies in a forest fire when they’re that close to home. We weren’t outdoorsy enough to die in a forest anywhere. Or so it seemed to me.On the West Coast, the 2017 onslaught of forest fires has been widespread and relentless—a char stretching from South Cariboo, British Columbia, last summer to the Caravaggio exhibit in the Getty Center just above west Los Angeles Thursday. Blazes are striking with growing regularity in the region, sparked in part by drought and record-breaking heat. Seven of California’s 10 largest modern wildfires have come in past 14 years.The news coverage of these fires plays like a disaster movie. Forested hills wrapped in a devil’s fiery cloak. Well-tended homes reduced to scorched concrete and melted bikes. By this point, Americans are used to watching with a mix of horror and curiosity. But as the frequency of wildfires increases, it’s also more likely for people on the West Coast to find themselves in their paths—and not always because they’re away from home.RELATED: Has Climate Change Intensified 2017’s Western Wildfires?My experience began on a sunny Saturday afternoon in early September. Labor Day was the first time my wife and I had all three of our busy, nearly grown kids with us since Christmas. Figuring we’d spend the day together romping around Oregon’s natural playground, we drove 40 miles east to the Eagle Creek Trail, a path that follows a waterfall-clotted river on an uphill climb toward the richly forested Bull Run watershed.When we arrived just after noon, the parking lot was so crowded that we had to double back and bootleg a spot on the side of the road. Setting out through a thicket of multigenerational tourist families, taut hikers, cooler-toting beer dudes, toddler-chasing couples, and dozens of other Oregon types, we continued for three breezy miles, had a shady lunch at the High Bridge, and after an hour or so headed to the Punch Bowl Falls swimming area for a cooling dip. We were back on the trail at 4 p.m. for the gentle two-mile stroll down to the car. A sweet end to a lovely afternoon, right until one of my sons, Teddy, came sprinting back from walking a few hundred feet ahead of us.The trail was on fire, he shouted. In fact, the entire hillside was ablaze.RELATED: California Is Running Out of Inmates to Fight Its FiresThinking dad thoughts, I made a few steps forward to check it out, but Teddy put his hand up to my chest. You do not want to get closer.Twenty minutes earlier, a few feckless teenagers had tossed a smoke bomb from the trail, and hell had been unleashed. Our cheerful family outing had sent us into the maw of a deadly siege. But that was absurd. So I sighed and girded myself for something more reasonable: an unexpected pain in the ass.Back at Punch Bowl Falls, we spread the word among the 100-plus hikers, swimmers, and out-of-town visitors and joined them all in standing meekly on the riverbank watching the thin yellow haze of smoke grow into a seething black curtain. Forest Service choppers buzzed in to drop water on the blaze, made no impact, went off to reload. A smaller helicopter fluttered in to drop a note, but the instructions were vague: WE SEE YOU ... STAY PUT ... DANGER! Then that chopper was gone for good.RELATED: Photos of California's Destructive WildfiresWe stayed put on the riverside. Some teenagers tossed a Frisbee. Parents played with their kids. A few well-put-together women stood together and fretted. One asked me: Is this one of those fires that sucks the oxygen away and suffocates us right here?I made a face. Of course not.How do you know?Because it just isn’t.Denial is definitely not a smoke-wreathed river in Oregon, but I had to maintain some level of control of the situation. Not far away a ball of fire shot through the dense black smoke.I kept peering past the tree line, waiting for some kind of cavalry to come galloping in. Instead, a 30-ish fellow with short dark curls and a beard climbed up on a boulder and called out for attention. He was Technical Sergeant Robert Dones of the U.S. Air Force, a veteran of two tours in Afghanistan. After scoping out the movement of the fire, he had some ideas. The flames were too close for us to stay on the riverbank. We needed to get out now, and no matter how fast, how slow, how young or old, we were all going together. We would stay together until we were all safe.The cavalry, it turned out, had been among us the whole time.Off we went, away from one fire and bound for another trail that the map said would lead to a road where rescuers would be waiting. There was one problem: The path would lead us to the hem of the Indian Creek Fire, a blaze that had been burning out of control since July. There was no way of knowing if the fire would consume the trail before we got there, but given no other options, we crossed our fingers and kept moving.Through the gloaming and into the darkness, we trooped lit by cellphones across vertiginous shelves of cliffside scree. Five, eight, a dozen miles. Eventually, the canyon air thickened with smoke and the sky just above the western trees went red. The Indian Creek Fire was just over the hill, so close that its embers drifted around us—some tickling new flames from the underbrush. A Forest Service ranger hiked down to help us, and when she came near me, I pointed to a fresh blaze taking hold 100 feet from where we had stopped. “That doesn’t matter,” she replied in a taut monotone.Two miles beyond the embers, we stopped again to rest for a few hours. My family had no clothes beyond our T-shirts and shorts, and only 10 carrot sticks left over from lunch. Hungry and exhausted, we huddled together in the dirt and tried to sleep. The plan was to stay until dawn, but the Eagle Creek fire picked up speed in the night, and the Indian Creek blaze was closing in, too. We were rousted an hour before dawn into a thick, scratchy fog of smoke. After an hour or two of hiking, we started to meet Forest Service firefighters carrying their axes and water jugs to the front of the Indian Creek fire.Three hours later, we got to Wahtum Lake and trudged up the officially named Stairway to Heaven, a long, steep set of wood-and-dirt stairs, to find two dozen rescuers, a table full of military MREs, and school buses bound for safety.Too exhausted to feel much of anything beyond relief, we located places on the bus and sat numbly through the hour-long ride back to where we’d left our cars less than 24 hours earlier. We were home 90 minutes after that, finding everything just as we had left the morning before. I took off my boots and hosed them down, trying to wash the smoke and ash and filth, and left them on the back porch to dry.The next morning, I woke up to see smoke hanging above our yard. Taking my cup of coffee out to the back porch, I found my boots where I’d left them, just as ash-covered as they’d been before I’d hosed them out the day before. The winds had changed direction. We’d made it home, but the fire was still coming for us.This story originally appeared on TheAtlantic.com.More from The Atlantic: God’s Plan for Mike Pence, What Putin Really Wants"

The Paris Climate Agreement was a step towards hope, towards the kind of change I believe in.You know what happened next.Donald Trump became President and immediately set about undoing this progress. His administration scrubbed mentions of climate change from government websites, undermined or transferred scientists and public servants who worked to fight climate change, proposed massive cuts to government programs to curb emissions and tied the hands of the enforcement division at the Environmental Protection Agency.Worst of all, Trump walked away from the Paris Climate Agreement, and directed Scott Pruitt, the polluter-friendly official whom he put in charge of the EPA, to unwind President Obama’s Clean Power Plan.He didn’t do these things because we’d solved the problem. 2017 has seen an almost apocalyptic amount of damage to U.S. communities from climate-fueled natural disasters, from Puerto Rico, to Florida, to Texas, to the Midwest, to California and in many other places. Climate change threatens to significantly increase the number of people killed by disease, and the Pentagon rates climate-fueled mass migration and the fight over resources as one of our top national security threats.Donald Trump doesn’t agree that this threat is worth any effort. Polluters donated heavily to his campaign, and he believes that global warming is a Chinese hoax. He also doesn’t see climate as an issue that will cost him significant support or lead to popular opposition.He’s well aware that climate change doesn’t get a lot of attention in the press or in our national politics.This is the part where you come in.We have seen, this year, the extraordinary power of average citizens organizing to make a difference. The March for Women heralded a year in which women’s empowerment has been a national conversation. National organizing and opposition led the way to defeating attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. And in my state of Virginia, an overwhelming amount of energy led to victories at the ballot box for people opposed to what Donald Trump stands for.One of the first results of that energy in Virginia was the state’s announcement that it would move to join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a significant step up in the state’s effort to curb emissions.It joined the fight alongside states, municipalities, and businesses across the country ― groups which account for more than half of spending power in the country. State and local governments, like businesses, will respond to public pressure, and this is an area where climate activism ― calls, letters, emails and yes, even social media posts ― can make a difference.This is particularly true locally, where governments and businesses are likely to be most responsive. You can make it clear that you favor green policies and intend to support candidates and businesses which do likewise and achieve real change in your community.As long as Trump is president and the Congress is under control of people who refuse to act on climate, federal initiatives will be difficult to achieve... but that doesn’t mean no one in Washington cares.Over 50 House Democrats have come together to form the Safe Climate Caucus, which California’s Alan Lowenthal and I co-chair, to push Congress to act on climate.I’m also a member of the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus, an effort to form dialogue with Republicans and seek agreement where we can find it on climate solutions. The numbers of Republicans in Congress willing to work with us has risen sharply this year.Reading headlines about rising sea levels and constant record-breaking temperatures is frightening, but it’s important that we never forget that we have the power to act. Thanks in large part to efforts of the Obama Administration, the US economy is rapidly adopting clean energy, which is now one of the fastest-growing jobs sectors in the country.Trump has been awful for the country when it comes to climate action, but with hard work we can still show the world that the United States will lead on climate.Don Beyer represents Northern Virginia in Congress and serves as the Vice Ranking Member of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology"

Sanders Auctions on Thursday is set to sell off a wooden display ― standing about a foot tall and weighing roughly 4 pounds ― featuring two doorknobs and a simple brass lock. The hardware was involved in the break-in that sparked an investigation into a plot to bug the Watergate offices and the Nixon administration’s attempts to cover it all up.Bidding for the item is expected to start at $50,000. The lock was removed from Stair #2 to Suite 600 at 2600 Virginia Avenue in Washington, D.C., just one day after the break-in, according to the auction house. It comes with a notarized letter from locksmith James Rednowers, who later gave the hardware to Watergate superintendent James Herrald. A notarized letter signed by Herrald, as well as his business card, are also included.Mounting pressure from the Watergate investigation eventually led to President Richard M. Nixon’s resignation. The phrase “-gate” has become all but synonymous with scandal over the years, as it’s been tacked on the end of words from “deflate-” to “pizza-” to refer to shocking transgressions. As a gift, the Watergate lock could could serve as a cautionary coffee table centerpiece, reminding guests that there are some failures you’ll never live down. Just in time for the holidays!"

Bush’s secretary of state, is urging Alabamians to vote in Tuesday’s special election for the U.S. Senate ― a race she called “one of the most significant in Alabama’s history.” Rice, now a political science professor at Stanford University, provided a statement to AL.com ahead of the election between Republican Roy Moore and Democrat Doug Jones. The candidates are vying for the Senate seat that Jeff Sessions left when he became attorney general last year. “I encourage you to take a stand for our core principles and for what is right,” Rice wrote, without mentioning either candidate by name. “These critical times require us to come together to reject bigotry, sexism, and intolerance.” Moore, 70, has been accused by multiple women of groping, harassing and pursuing them sexually when they were minors and he was an adult in the 1980s. He has denied the allegations, calling them “malicious” and “false,” and claimed he has never met any of the six women who have accused him of sexual misconduct. President Donald Trump, who also has been accused of sexual misconduct, has endorsed Moore’s candidacy multiple times. Rice wrote that it is “imperative” that voters “remain focused on our priorities and not give way to side shows and antics.” She added: “I know that Alabamans need an independent voice in Washington. But we must also insist that our representatives are dignified, decent, and respectful of the values we hold dear.”She encouraged people to vote and to express themselves. “Sustain the central ideals and values that make our country a beacon for freedom and justice for the sake of Alabama and for the good of the United States of America.”"

His cause of death was not immediately released, but former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown told local media that Lee had suffered a cardiac arrest. “It is with profound sadness and terrible grief that we confirm that Mayor Edwin M. Lee passed away on Tuesday, December 12 at 1:11 a.m. at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital,” city officials said in a statement. “Family, friends and colleagues were at his side.

The city will hold an election on June 5 to name a mayor to finish out Lee’s term.“Ed was a true champion for working people and epitomized the California spirit,” California Gov. Jerry Brown said in a statement. “He’ll truly be missed.”Lee, the child of Chinese immigrants, was born and raised in Seattle and moved to the Bay Area to attend law school at the University of California, Berkeley. As a student, he became involved in advocacy by working for the civil rights group the Asian Law Caucus.“As the son of immigrants who became mayor of one of America’s largest cities, Ed broke down barriers and blazed a trail for future generations to follow,” Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), former district attorney of San Francisco, said Tuesday. “And at this inflection moment in our country when some have promoted hatred and division, Mayor Lee has been an outspoken advocate for diversity and inclusion.”Lee began working for San Francisco in 1989 as an adviser to then-Mayor Art Agnos. He held various positions within the city government until he was appointed city administrator in 2005. When then-Mayor Gavin Newsom was elected California’s lieutenant governor in 2011, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors appointed Lee as the city’s new leader. He won re-election in 2015.“His intellect, unshakable integrity, boundless optimism and contagious love for San Francisco elevated the City to greater heights,” Newsom said in a statement Tuesday. “He steered San Francisco with an unshakable hand, an indomitable spirit, and a great sense of humor.”Lee was best known for his progressive policies on immigration and defending San Francisco as a sanctuary city. He also tried to combat the city’s longstanding homelessness problem with the creation of Navigation Centers, a short-term housing option, and investments in affordable housing programs. Lee was also instrumental in raising San Francisco’s minimum wage in 2014, making it the highest in the country at the time. Before entering city politics in the 1980s, Lee cut his teeth in San Francisco activism by advocating for the city’s large Chinese-American population. As a lawyer, he famously sued the San Francisco Police Department over height requirements that excluded many Asian-American candidates and sued the San Francisco Fire Department over racial hazing.He was also a fierce advocate for residents of the city’s Chinatown, the oldest such neighborhood in the U.S. and one of the largest Chinese enclaves outside China. In 1978, Lee famously went after the city over unlivable conditions at the neighborhood’s Ping Yuen public housing complex and organized a successful rent strike.Advocacy for fair and safe housing would become part of his legacy as mayor, too. Just the day before his death, Lee announced legislation that would recoup costs from landlords illegally housing people in unsafe buildings. But his term has not been without controversy. Lee has been criticized for poorly managing the city’s growth, which was triggered by the rise of the region’s tech industry and subsequent influx of high-paid tech workers. That growth ballooned beyond what Lee could have imagined when he first took office. The boom resulted in higher housing prices, congestion and traffic issues, and social tensions due to rising income disparity. Lee’s efforts to increase housing were often stifled by the city’s strict zoning regulations, building height restrictions and NIMBY activism.In an effort to revitalize the city’s blighted Mid-Market Street corridor, Lee introduced a tax break for companies that moved into the neighborhood. The 2012 incentive, which became known as the “Twitter Tax Break,” proved controversial when it was revealed that it helped companies avoid $34 million in city taxes in 2014 alone. That tax break helped earn Lee a reputation for being business-friendly to a fault, but he often emphasized that such moves were part of his overall mission to help struggling neighborhoods.“We need to continue to make sure this is the city for the 100 percent,” he often repeated in public statements.

Driving north along what’s typically a stunningly beautiful stretch of California coast, Fienup could see a wall of fire to the right of the freeway. As he passed Faria Beach, about 15 miles north of the city of Ventura, there was some hope. The large palm tree nursery that’s visible from the freeway was still there. When he drove back two hours later, it was gone. “It wasn’t just on fire, it was gone. It had entirely burned down,” Fienup recounted. Fienup is the executive director of the Center for Economic Research and Forecasting at California Lutheran University. As a Ventura resident and an economics researcher, he’s watched in horror as the Thomas fire has devastated the land he calls home.The Thomas fire is the largest and most uncontrolled of five major blazes that have hit Southern California in the last week. Combined, the fires have burned through more than 250,000 acres in multiple counties and have affected more acreage in Southern California in one week than the 21 massive blazes combined that ravaged the northern part of California throughout the month of October. The devastation the fire has wrought on the Ventura economy, Fienup says, will be felt for years.Ventura County is covered with orchards, mostly growing avocados and citrus. The city of Ventura alone has nearly 7,000 acres designated as agricultural land. Fruit produced in the region is marketed mostly through large packing and shipping companies and distributed all across the country. It’s still too early to assess the complete effect of the wildfires on the local agriculture industry, but what’s clear already is that the damage will be significant, John Krist, chief executive officer of the Ventura County’s Farm Bureau, told HuffPost. The Thomas fire swept through hillsides containing thousands of acres of avocado groves between Ventura and the neighboring city of Santa Paula. Krist gauged that probably at least several hundred acres had been damaged or destroyed.Portions of the fire that reached into Carpinteria and Ojai also blazed through land heavily planted with avocado and citrus orchards. The CEO suspects there were also major losses in the orange and mandarin orchards on slopes above the Ojai Valley, where fires wreaked havoc last Wednesday night.As of Monday evening, the Thomas fire was still just 20 percent contained and actively spreading into neighboring communities.It will take some time before growers can fully assess how much of their crop they ultimately lost, and the devastation may not be limited to burn areas. Farmers have experienced significant losses as record high Santa Ana winds, which have fueled the fires, have also flung fruit off the trees.Growers will also have to repair damaged irrigation systems and monitor the denuded hillsides that could give way to mudslides and debris flows once the winter rain arrives. Farmers will ultimately have to wait several weeks before deciding what to do with the scorched trees. “Some may look terrible now but recover. Others that appear to have suffered only moderate damage may collapse later when stressed,” Krist said.It isn’t necessarily difficult to replace damage trees, he noted. But it could take up to five years before a new tree starts bearing fruit. It’s one thing for a natural disaster to hit an area with a strong economy, but in a place like Ventura, which was was already experiencing economic hardship, the repercussions may be devastating.Ventura’s agricultural industry had been struggling in recent years, hit hard by California’s record drought. While the drought officially ending in the rest of the state in April, it is ongoing in Ventura. In addition, the local agricultural industry had a hard time adapting to new regulations on the chemicals that can be used on farms, as well as overtime and minimum-wage standards. All of these factors contributed to reduced crop yields in recent years.As Ventura’s agricultural industry tumbled, one of the region’s other major industries went into decline as well. Amgen Inc., the largest independent biotechnology firm in the world, is based in Thousand Oaks and is one of Ventura County’s biggest employers. The company laid off hundreds of Southern California employees earlier this year, with many of the positions being relocated to Tampa, Florida. “Ventura County is uniquely unhealthy compared to neighboring counties,” Fienup said. “That’s where a natural disaster of this sort is really troubling. I don’t think Ventura County is well-positioned to absorb an impact of this size.”He said the county’s recovery will likely be “slow and difficult” and pointed to the Tea fire that destroyed 210 homes in the nearby community of Montecito in 2008. As of 2016, 31 percent of the homes destroyed in that fire still had not been rebuilt.If there’s anything that gives Fienup hope right now it’s that Ventura County “has a very strong community identity.”“It’s the cohesiveness of that community that I think gives it real strength,” Fienup said. “There have been amazing examples of generosity as people reach out to those who have lost their homes.”But, he added, “the economic reality is much less hopeful.” "

As of 2016, 31 percent of the homes destroyed in that fire still had not been rebuilt.If there’s anything that gives Fienup hope right now it’s that Ventura County “has a very strong community identity.”“It’s the cohesiveness of that community that I think gives it real strength,” Fienup said. “There have been amazing examples of generosity as people reach out to those who have lost their homes.”But, he added, “the economic reality is much less hopeful.” "

While speaking at the Fast Company Innovation Festival, the celebrity chef positioned himself as a champion for women in the food industry. “The industry is changing a lot and people are trying to do the right thing and it’s still slow to come,” Batali said, according to Fast Company. “You know, it took a long time for those dinosaurs to go extinct and it’s gonna be that way and it’s just... What you can do is push forward and do the right thing in your own place.” “I think the reckoning is coming across the board,” he said. “It is a time for women and men to face each other across the board, across the table.”Batali said he employed a majority-female crew at his Del Posto restaurant, “not because they have a vagina, it’s because they are the smartest people for the job.” “I hate it when someone calls and says, ‘Listen, we want to do a piece on [executive chef] Melissa [Rodriguez] as a great woman chef,’” he added. “Why don’t you fucking do a piece about her being a great chef and we’ll talk about her sexuality later?” In an Eater report published Monday, four women accused Batali of sexually harassing them over the last two decades. Three had worked for him, and the other worked in the restaurant industry. The chef sent a statement of apology to the publication: “I apologize to the people I have mistreated and hurt. Although the identities of most of the individuals mentioned in these stories have not been revealed to me, much of the behavior described does, in fact, match up with ways I have acted. That behavior was wrong and there are no excuses.

The emails were pulled off the Samsung cell phone police took from him the day of his arrest, when he was taken into custody along with more than 200 others. “Just checking in. Got any assignments you want to throw at me?” read one email to an editor at the Rivard Report. In another email, he said he was “specifically focusing in on street friction, protest and support and police.” Wood, who had focused on commercial and wedding photography, said he was trying to build a portfolio as a photojournalist. Wood’s defense attorney, Brett Cohen, shared messages Wood had exchanged with a contact in which he discussed photography and his plans for covering events surrounding the inauguration. “Been trying to get my professionalism up to par: website, CV, resume shit,” he wrote. The other person said that an international photo credit would be good for Wood’s career. When he was in town, Wood wrote in one message that covering the anti-facist protest was his “best lead.” Wood also attempted to email a high-profile photographer, saying they’d met in the photographer’s apartment in D.C. several years earlier, “took bong hits” and talked about the man’s book.Gregg Pemberton, a Metropolitan Police Department detective who also serves in the police union in D.C., admitted that his search of Wood’s phone didn’t show any contacts with protest organizers or even any of the other defendants.Pemberton testified that he had no evidence that Wood had used or attempted to use what the government has called a “fake” press badge that featured Wood’s photo but another person’s name. Wood is expected to explain why the badge doesn’t include his name if he takes the stand.Cohen also played a video clip of Wood being taken into custody, which features officers tossing press pass, business cards, and a reporters notebook into a bag as they processed Wood. The photographer instructed an officer on how to properly dissemble his camera.“I think courteous is a fair representation of Mr. Wood’s behavior,” Pemberton testified.In the trial, which opened Nov. 20, Justice Department prosecutors are trying to hold six people they’ve conceded didn’t cause any destruction or engage in any violence responsible for the actions of those who did, alleging they are part of a rioting conspiracy. If convicted of the six felonies and two misdemeanors each, Wood and his co-defendants would be exposed to maximum sentences of over 60 years in prison (though such harsh punishments are unlikely). The trial will resume Tuesday, when the prosecution is likely to rest its case.

80,POLITICS,Lead Cop In Felony Trial For Trump Inaugural Protesters Sent Anti-Activist Tweets,Ryan J. Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gregg-pemberton-trump-inauguration-felony-trial_us_5a301402e4b046175433e4f3,Gregg Pemberton was quizzed about his use of Twitter by defense lawyers.,2017-12-12,Police Det. Gregg Pemberton (right) has served as the lead investigator of the violence that occurred during the inauguration of Donald Trump as president. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a3014711500001f0049b444.png?cache=NRTYWLd61z&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The police detective who has spent virtually all of this year aiding the prosecution of individuals arrested en masse on the day of President Donald Trump’s inauguration was questioned on Tuesday about tweets he sent, retweeted or liked that were critical of Black Lives Matter and “leftist goons.”Gregg Pemberton, a detective with Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department who also serves as an official in the local police union, had until recently maintained a public Twitter account that reflected his views on a variety of law enforcement topics. On the stand, Pemberton claimed he tweeted “solely” as a member of the D.C. police union board, though he later said that he had used the account in his investigative capacity.The actions of the police on Jan. 20, as a crowd of mostly black-clad individuals smashed windows and caused general chaos in downtown Washington, have been the subject of scrutiny. Critics claim they arrested scores of protesters indiscriminately, without determining which ones had been violent. Pemberton testified in the case against six of those arrested, who have been charged with various felonies.Pemberton sent tweets on inauguration day that indicated he was inspired by how officers responded to the destructive behavior of some protesters.In one tweet, he wrote that it was “incredibly inspiring” to see the restraint “being employed by officers today. Ironic it’s the same officers that get accused of being violent.” In another, he wrote he was “receiving reports of injured officers,” and that he was “humbled at the level of professionalism I’ve seen today & am proud of our members.”Pemberton acknowledged to defense attorneys that he deleted those tweets and locked down his account following what he termed the “targeted harassment” he received in recent days after other users called attention to his tweets.Pemberton testified that, after spending nearly all of 2017 reviewing video from that day, he still believed in the “general sense” that police had handled the unrest “professionally.” At times, Pemberton said, “better decisions could have been made,” but he said he wasn’t going to “armchair quarterback a few-second-clip” of police use of force. Pemberton elaborated on his view of Twitter on the stand, testifying that he believed “sometimes you need to be bombastic in order to get attention” on the platform. “Sometimes the loudest person in the room gets the attention,” he said, adding that part of Twitter is saying “edgy, often times obnoxious things.”In one tweet, Pemberton wrote that body cameras were the “bane of disingenuous ‘activists’ who peddle lies & falsehoods.” He testified that he believed there is a “cottage industry of people who just want to make money” who “gum up the works” for the “genuine activists” who truly want to reform how police operate. He claimed he was not speaking about Black Lives Matter specifically, and painted himself as someone who supports police reform and is regularly critical of Washington’s police force Department.The trial opened on Nov. 20. The prosecutors are lawyers from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia, which is under the control of the Justice Department. Washington is unique in that both federal and local crimes that elsewhere would be tried by local prosecutors are instead handled by Justice Department attorneys.Before the jury entered court for the morning, Judge Lynn Leibovitz warned Assistant U.S. Attorney Jennifer Kerkhoff to be careful not to trivialize tweets that Pemberton sent about policing. But Leibovitz also seemed to suggest that following certain news accounts ― like Breitbart and Fox News ― didn’t necessarily indicate Pemberton’s political beliefs.Kerkhoff, outside of the presence of the jury, said that people have been claiming online that Pemberton is a “racist Nazi.” Pemberton’s Twitter account drew attention after tweets from Unicorn Riot, a media collective that has manned the trial and offered extensive coverage of the proceedings, said that he had been following “one of the main online hubs for neo-nazi ‘alt right’ harassment campaigns.” That’s the type of information that other Twitter users used to suggest that Pemberton was “definitely at least Nazi-adjacent.”There’s no evidence that Pemberton holds such extremist views. But there’s lots of evidence he’s not a huge fan of the types of individuals he was investigating. While one can’t necessarily ascribe political beliefs to Twitter likes, Pemberton liked a tweet from former Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke, a vocal Trump supporter, that said America needed to push back against “leftist goons.”Defense attorneys also aired videos in which Pemberton spoke about Trump’s appeal to the law enforcement community. In one video interview with the One America News Network, Pemberton said that Trump “certainly has a message of law and order and he is appealing to a lot of police officers.”Pemberton also tweeted in April that he hadn’t heard much about “police shootings of unarmed black youth” in awhile. “Did they run out of funds for their false narrative?” he tweeted. Later, he tweeted that body cameras worn by police had “destroyed” the “false narrative of BLM,” referring to Black Lives Matter.Pressed on his views of Black Lives Matter, Pemberton suggested that his opinions had shifted in the past year-and-a-half. He said that the decentralized movement had become “a lot more level headed.” He said he had disagreed with the rhetoric from Black Lives Matter activists in the past, but that he heard more positive commentary from them recently.Ryan Reilly is HuffPost’s senior justice reporter, covering criminal justice, federal law enforcement and legal affairs.

Actress Caity Lotz, who plays Sara Lance and her superhero alter ego White Canary in The CW’s “Arrow” universe, tweeted on Sunday that she’d love to see actor Daniel Dae Kim play Superman. She was inspired by a gif of Kim taking off his glasses, which Kore Asian Media had tweeted out with the caption, “Clark Kent transforming into Superman.”All hell then broke loose on Twitter, with seemingly everyone and their mother jumped on the bandwagon. That included Marvel’s “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.” actress Chloe Bennet, who just couldn’t hide her love of the idea. Kim even responded to the hype, noting that he’s a fan of Henry Cavill, who plays Superman in the DC Extended Universe. But, he added, “We really could use a big screen Asian superhero, couldn’t we?” Amen to that! It’s been a while since an actor of Asian descent played the role of a big-name superhero. Asian-American Dean Cain played Superman in the TV series “Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman” in the mid-nineties.But Twitter users have pointed out that it’s about time we have another Asian face as Superman, especially after the introduction of DC’s comic book series “The New Super-Man,” which debuted last year. The series, written by 2016 MacArthur Fellow Gene Luen Yang, features Chinese hero Kenan Kong, who hails from Shanghai. “The broader goal is to show that a character of any color, a hero of any kind of background can be compelling ― can be somebody that anybody can identify with,” Yang told HuffPost last year.And who better to fit the bill than Kim? He was recently honored at the Unforgettable Gala in Beverly Hills, California, which spotlights Asian-American trailblazers in the entertainment industry. Earlier this year, he left TV series “Hawaii Five-0” over a pay dispute, with sources claiming that CBS refused to pay Asian actors in a manner equal to their white costars. Kim later spoke out about the situation, saying that “the path to equality is rarely easy.”“As an Asian American actor, I know first-hand how difficult it is to find opportunities at all, let alone play a well developed, three dimensional character like Chin Ho,” Kim wrote of his character on the show. “I will miss him sincerely. What made him even more special is that he was a representative of a place my family and I so dearly love.” With the strength and grit to do what’s right, it seems Kim embodies a superhero in every way.

82,SCIENCE,How To Tell If A Dinosaur Is Fake,"The Atlantic, ContributorExploring the American idea since 1857",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-to-tell-if-a-dinosaur-is-fake_us_5a3031c2e4b0b73dde46a7f0,"By Ed Yong On Wednesday, a team of scientists unveiled a newly discovered dinosaur that had the body and sickle-clawed feet",2017-12-12,<p>A visitor wearing a T-Rex costume arrives at the London Comic Con. </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a3031c7150000260049b4d3.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Ed YongOn Wednesday, a team of scientists unveiled a newly discovered dinosaur that had the body and sickle-clawed feet of Velociraptor, the head and snout of a swan, and weird arms that were somewhere between grasping limbs and flattened flippers. This bizarre murder-swan, which the team christened Halszkaraptor, was so odd that when they first saw it, they suspected that it was a fake—a Frankensaur that had been assembled from parts of different dinosaurs. “All of us thought, when we first saw it: Oh come on now,” says Philip Currie from the University of Alberta.But after using a particle accelerator to scan the animal, and the rock in which it is still encased, Currie and his colleagues are convinced that it’s the real deal.Not everyone is so sure, though. When Steve Brusatte from the University of Edinburgh first saw a picture of Halszkaraptor, his spidey sense also started tingling. Its posture, from the curve of its tail to the way its claws were almost perfectly fanned out, looked strange, as if it was ready for display. Its body looked like that of Velociraptor, but its skull looked like one from a different dinosaur group—the alvarezsaurs. And most worryingly of all, the specimen has a convoluted history. It was poached from Mongolia (as many dinosaurs are), and smuggled into Japan and Britain, before ending up in a private collection in France—a meandering route that offered few reassurances and many chances for tampering.RELATED: Apparently This Is What a Swimming Dinosaur Looks Like“This new discovery has thrown a lot of us for a loop,” he says. “It’s either really a new dinosaur, which would be awesome, or it’s been tampered with and I really hope that’s not the case. The authors worked really hard to demonstrate that it hasn’t, using the best tools at their disposal. But I wonder if we have the right tools, since the fakes are so sophisticated.”No matter their views on Halszkaraptor, everyone I spoke to agreed that fossil forgery is a surprisingly serious problem. There’s a long history of hoax fossils, like the infamous Piltdown Man—a human skull that was glued to an orangutan’s jaw, and presented as a missing link in human evolution. That was in 1912, but a century on, fake or doctored specimens still abound in fossil shows, private collections, and even in small regional museums. These bogus specimens aren’t cries for attention. “In my experience, I’ve never seen a single specimen that was made by the scientific community to get more publicity,” says Mark Norell, a curator at the American Museum of Natural History. Instead, they’re almost always the work of people trying to earn a buck—often poor farmers in China. RELATED: A 130-Year-Old Fact About Dinosaurs Might Be WrongThere is a lucrative market in fossils, which owes much of its existence to Sue, a beautifully preserved Tyrannosaurus that was unearthed in 1990 and auctioned for $7.6 million. After her sale, “a modern gold rush began, and it has not let up,” wrote Paige Williams in The New Yorker. Fossils became status symbols, attracting wealthy buyers and unscrupulous vendors. An extensive black market arose, connecting fossil-rich sites like China and Mongolia and anyone with money to burn and a penchant for trophies from another age. The fakes are sometimes created from whole cloth—or rather, from whole plaster. These are usually crude and easy to recognize. Currie remembers seeing photos of an alleged Archaeopteryx—a pivotal species which helped to show that birds evolved from other dinosaurs. It was in Beijing, but after Currie flew over, “within three seconds of seeing it, I knew it was 100 percent fake,” he says. The weight of it was wrong. The texture of the bone was wrong. No actual paleontologist would be fooled, but Currie found several such fakes in tourist shops, all with expensive price tags.In many ways, the market in forged fossils is similar to the one in forged artworks, says Norell, who has a foot in both worlds. When he attends the gargantuan annual fossil show in Tuscon, he takes the same equipment that he uses to examine fine art, like a special ultraviolet light. “I have a carbide needle that I can heat up with a lighter and push onto something,” he says. “If it’s real, guys will let you do it. If it has epoxy, they won’t.”RELATED: A Dinosaur-Sized MysterySome phonies are harder to spot. Currie recalls seeing a Tarbosaurus—a Mongolian relative of Tyrannosaurus—that “looked pretty good and was sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars.” When his team analyzed it with a medical scanner, they showed that just a single bone in the jaw was real. “It was convincing enough that we couldn’t be sure how much was real and how much wasn’t.”More often, actual fossils are touched up to make them more dramatic. Another Tarbosaurus, which was famously seized by the American government in 2012, was mostly real, but its teeth, fingers, and toes had all been reconstructed. Feathered dinosaurs are all the rage, so artisans will sometimes paint the outlines of feathers on their fossils. One dinosaur had a crest added to its skull by fossil-poachers, who wanted to make it look more dramatic and complete; scientists spent so much time removing the extra material that, in a bit of questionable victim-blaming, they named the beast Irritator. And by some estimates, around 80 percent of the marine reptile specimens that are on display in local and regional Chinese museums have been “altered or artificially combined to varying degrees.”The vast majority of sham fossils are chimeras—two or more actual specimens that have been glued together to make them seem new. Sometimes, the work is ... not well-researched. Currie once saw a Confuciusornis—a crow-sized Cretaceous bird—that was clearly fake because its foot had been glued directly to its knee, with no shinbone in the middle. It was on display in a Chinese museum.But these pseudosaurs can be far more convincing. In the Gobi desert of Mongolia, dinosaurs are often found in soft sandstone. Fakers have been known to crumble this rock and then re-harden it to glue separate specimens together. “It can be really hard to tell if that’s fake,” says Brusatte. “Is that original sandstone or sandstone that’s been put back together?”Mostly, these counterfeits have little impact on what we know about dinosaurs. They don’t feature in high-profile papers, and they stay out of the limelight. But there are exceptions. In 1998, the owners of a small Utah museum acquired a specimen from China. The beast was never described in a scientific journal, but that didn’t stop National Geographic from hosting a press conference about it, or featuring it in the magazine as Archaeoraptor—a “true missing link in the complex chain that connects dinosaurs to birds.”“The specimen was suspicious right from the beginning,” says Currie, who was one of the scientists called in to examine it. The tail didn’t seem to connect to the body. The feet were exactly symmetrical in a way that real limbs just aren’t, as if one had been made using the other as a template.It turned out that Archaeoraptor was the dinosaur equivalent of a horse costume, with the front and back halves played by different actors. Someone had glued the head and upper body of Yanornis (a primitive bird) to the tail of Microraptor (a four-winged Velociraptor cousin) and the legs and feet of an unidentified animal. Some missing parts had been filled in with a paste that was made from ground-up bone. It looked like bone at first glance because it was, but a medical CT scanner revealed the trickery: The fakes lacked the complex internal structures of real bones.“The Archaeoraptor fiasco really brought the issue home to dinosaur workers,” says Brusatte. “There hasn’t been a big forgery like that in dinosaurs in the last 15 years. But we’re due for something like this to come up again and I just hope that it’s not me who’s fooled by it.”He has reason to worry because by his own admission, some of the fakes are “really, really good”—good enough to fool even the trained eye. And the wider problem is that no one really knows which techniques are good enough to distinguish fossils from faux-sils. CT scans helped to pierce the Archaeoraptorillusion, but “looking at a CT scan is oftentimes like looking at a Rorschach test, or at tea leaves,” says Brusatte. “You can see many things in there.” Would it be good enough to detect sandstone that had been joined together with reconsolidated sandstone? Who knows?That’s why Currie and his colleagues scanned Halszkaraptor using a synchrotron, producing scans that are much higher in resolution. “You can look at the continuity of the bones and the rocks, and whether there’s any gluing or infilling,” he says. They could even show that the chemical composition of the rock is consistent across the fossil. To fake that, someone would have had to find two specimens from the same site, and join them together using rock that also had the same origins.Currie is highly respected among his peers, and his name gives weight to the claims around Halszkaraptor, even among the skeptics. I asked him how certain he is that the specimen is real, on a scale of 1 to 10. “I’m at least a 9,” he tells me. “You can never say that you are 100 percent sure, because some of these people are really incredible artisans.”“You’re running to catch up with the forgers,” says Brusatte. “I don’t know what the definitive evidence would be either way, or what sort of burden of proof would be enough. The only thing that can prove that it’s genuine is another team finding another skeleton and digging it up themselves. And I hope that happens.”This story originally appeared on TheAtlantic.com.More from The Atlantic: God’s Plan for Mike Pence, What Putin Really Wants"
83,POLITICS,"Under Trump, Union Election Rules Could Be Tilted In Employers' Favor",Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-national-labor-relations-board-roll-back-rules_us_5a3004e4e4b01598ac4876c1,The newly conservative National Labor Relations Board may scrap worker-friendly reforms made under Obama.,2017-12-12,President Donald Trump's National Labor Relations Board is reconsidering reforms designed to make it easier to unionize.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a3007271600002100c4f810.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Three years ago, federal officials overhauled the way union elections proceed in the workplace, streamlining the process to give employers less time to pressure workers not to join. The reform was long sought by labor groups who hoped the changes could make it a little easier to unionize.But now, President Donald Trump has reshaped the National Labor Relations Board, the agency that oversees union elections. With a new conservative majority, the board is considering scrapping the worker-friendly reforms from the Obama years and bringing back the system that employers were fond of.On Tuesday, the agency published a notice in the Federal Register soliciting feedback on the union election rules. The board asked whether it should keep the current rules in place, tweak them or simply revert to the old ones. Tellingly, it was the three Republican board members who’d approved the notice, while the two Democratic members disapproved.One of those Democrats, Mark Gaston Pearce, issued a sharp dissent on the move, saying the “Notice and Request for Information” was really a “Notice and Quest for Alternative Facts.” He wrote that agency staff had poured thousands of hours of work into carefully updating the election rules back in 2014 and that the dire warnings his conservative colleagues had made about the rule changes hadn’t come to pass.“It is indeed unfortunate that when historians examine how our Agency functioned during this tumultuous time,” Pearce wrote, “they will have no choice but to conclude that the Board abandoned its role as an independent agency and chose to cast aside reasoned deliberation in pursuit of an arbitrary exercise of power.”Pearce’s Democratic colleague, Lauren McFerran, wrote that the timing of the board’s request suggests the majority is interested not in “objective data,” but in “manufacturing a rationale” for rolling back the rules now that Republicans are in power.The rule changes could affect any worker set to vote in a union election on the job. After a union files for an election at a workplace, the employer will often spend a lot of time trying to dissuade workers from voting yes. The employer usually benefits from a longer, drawn-out process, as management spreads its message and workers get spooked about unionizing. For years, unions and Democrats sought to tighten up the process and give employers fewer ways to delay votes.Among other changes, the 2014 rules shifted certain litigation that had typically happened before an election to after the workers have voted. The rules also made it possible for unions, companies and the labor board to file and serve documents electronically, rather than on paper. Although employers usually appreciate having red tape removed from bureaucratic processes, business lobbying groups claimed these changes took away time that employers needed to deal with union campaigns and would lead to “ambush” elections.So far, there hasn’t been much evidence that the new rules have changed election outcomes dramatically. One analysis by Bloomberg BNA found that more union elections were resolved quickly and that they tended to go in the union’s favor. But another analysis, done by the labor board itself and reported by Politico, found that elections were happening twice as fast but that unions’ win rate was essentially unchanged. That would suggest employers’ concerns about “ambush” elections were overblown.Sharon Block, a former Democratic member of the labor board, tweeted Tuesday that the “predictions of catastrophe” hadn’t materialized and that the only good reason to revisit the rules is “a political one.”Although Trump’s nominees to the labor board haven’t been there long, this isn’t the first sign that they could significantly reshape policy to help employers.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a2ffbdb1500001f0049b3b9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Billie Lourd found two beautiful ways to pay tribute to her late mother, Carrie Fisher, at the premiere of her mom’s last “Star Wars” film. At “The Last Jedi” premiere over the weekend, the actress, who also stars in the film, wore her hair in a braided bun. The hairstyle is the same ’do Fisher wore in the 1977 film “Star Wars: A New Hope.” As BuzzFeed pointed out, Lourd also wore the same ring Fisher wore to the “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” premiere in 2015. Earlier this year, Lourd wore a Princess Leia tribute dress in honor of her mother at the Star Wars Celebration in Orlando. It was her first public appearance since her mother died in December 2016. She collaborated with Tom Ford on the design of the dress.During an appearance on “Ellen” in September, Lourd spoke about the “impossible” experience of losing her mother and grandmother Debbie Reynolds within a day of each other. “It’s so hard to talk about,” she said. “I don’t know, if I say that I’m doing good, I’m too happy. And if I say that I’m not doing good, then I’m a mess. So it’s really hard to know what to say about it because it is just so surreal and impossible to deal with.”  “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” hits theaters nationwide this Friday."

That includes moderates like Sens. Susan Collins (Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), as well as retiring Sens. Jeff Flake (Ariz.) and Bob Corker (Tenn.). Every Democrat opposed him in the 50-48 vote.It is extremely rare for the Senate to confirm a judge with such an abysmal rating from the national legal organization. The ABA has reviewed more than 1,700 federal judicial nominees since 1989, and only three, including Grasz, have been deemed unanimously unqualified. The other two, both nominees of President George W. Bush, were withdrawn and replaced with other nominees after the ABA’s assessment came in.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) seemed baffled that Grasz was even getting a vote.“A panel of nonpartisan legal experts unanimously concluded that this man is not fit to be a judge,” he said on the Senate floor. “What else do my colleagues need to know?”The ABA interviewed more than 180 people connected to Grasz, who was Nebraska’s chief deputy attorney general for 11 years, in evaluating his fitness to be a judge. Colleagues described him as “gratuitously rude,” per the ABA report, and said they had an “unusual fear” of consequences if they said anything negative about him because of his “deep connection” to powerful politicians in Nebraska.ABA members also raised concerns that Grasz would be “unable to separate his role as an advocate from that of a judge,” given his record on issues like LGBTQ and abortion rights. Among other things, Grasz served on a nonprofit board that backed so-called conversion therapy for LGBTQ kids, and in a 1999 article argued that lower courts should be able to overrule Supreme Court decisions on abortion rights because “abortion jurisprudence is, to a significant extent, a word game.”“In sum, the evaluators and the Committee found that temperament issues, particularly bias and lack of open-mindedness, were problematic,” reads a statement by Pam Bresnahan, the chair of the ABA’s standing committee that reviews nominees. “The evaluators found that the people interviewed believed that the nominee’s bias and the lens through which he viewed his role as a judge colored his ability to judge fairly.”Grasz is one of four Trump judicial nominees to get a “not qualified” ABA rating, unanimous or otherwise. Others include district court nominees Brett Talley, who has never tried a case and didn’t tell the Senate that his wife is chief of staff to White House counsel Don McGahn; Charles Goodwin, who raised questions about his ability to fulfill the demands of a federal judge; and Holly Teeter, who lacks trial court experience.Grasz is the first of the bunch to get confirmed. He endured a humiliating confirmation hearing, as Democrats pressed him on his awful ABA rating.Part of the problem here is that Trump is flying through judicial nominations without much vetting, and he’s not submitting his potential court picks to the ABA before he announces their nominations. Most presidents have waited for the ABA rating to come out before officially announcing a nominee, in part to save face in the event one of their nominees gets a particularly bad rating. Former President Barack Obama, for example, didn’t nominate any of his potential court picks who got an unqualified ABA rating.“No president has so quickly nominated so many troubling nominees,” said Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor and expert on judicial nominations. “Bad process can make for bad judges, and these are life-tenured posts.”Republicans had not raised many concerns with Trump’s unqualified nominees until Tuesday, when Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, unexpectedly said he thinks Trump should withdraw Talley and another district court nominee, Jeff Mateer, who has described transgender children as evidence of “Satan’s plan.”Progressive judicial advocacy groups hailed Grassley’s comments as a sign that Republicans may stop being a rubber stamp for Trump’s questionable court nominees.“We believe this is an opportunity for a real turning point,” said Nan Aron, president of Alliance for Justice, “if the White House uses this moment to reassess its criteria for judicial nominations and to put forward nominees who will be serious about upholding critical legal rights and protections for all.”White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders had no response to Grassley’s request at her daily press briefing."

The court heard that argument, and agreed,” Lambda Legal attorney Peter Renn said in a statement late Monday. “With yet another court ruling that the President has engaged in unlawful discrimination, the policy’s days are clearly numbered, and its final demise can’t come fast enough for those whose military careers hang in the balance.”This was the second court decision to come down on Monday challenging Trump’s ban. Another federal judge ruled in a similar lawsuit in the District of Columbia earlier Monday, rejecting the administration’s request for a stay and thereby maintaining a ruling that allows transgender people to enlist in the military starting Jan. 1.The Department of Justice said in a statement Monday night that “we disagree with the Court’s ruling and are seeking to stay the Defense Department’s obligations under that ruling as we evaluate next steps.”A third lawsuit challenging the ban ― this one filed by the American Civil Liberties Union ― has been making its way through the courts in Maryland. In November, the judge on that case issued a preliminary injunction to prevent the administration from denying funding for sex-reassignment surgeries."

Of course “The Greatest Showman” got a nomination for Best Motion Picture, Musical or Comedy. Of course “The Big Sick,” starring Kumail Nanjiani, was entirely shut out. And yes, of course Christopher Plummer received a nod for his last-minute performance in “All the Money in the World” after replacing Kevin Spacey amid mounting sexual misconduct allegations against the actor.Because even though the Globes are regarded as the irreverent, tipsy and delightfully unpredictable sibling of the Academy Awards, that sibling also constantly makes arbitrary, bizarre and ill-advised choices.That’s part of the fun of the Globes: marveling at the lovely absurdities of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which has nominated movies like “The Tourist” and “Bobby” for Best Motion Picture, has seen fit to nominate Hugh Jackman for possibly his worst performance in “Kate in Leopold,” and this year planted “Get Out” in the Best Picture category as a comedy. If these kinds of nominations inspire any rage, it’s the gleeful kind. But this year’s Best Director category is one that takes the basic qualities of the Golden Globes to a whole new level, perhaps to a level that teeters on downright insulting. This year, Ridley Scott (“All the Money in the World”), Steven Spielberg (“The Post”), Christopher Nolan (“Dunkirk”), Guillermo del Toro (“The Shape of Water”) and Martin McDonagh (“Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri”) are the five filmmakers up for Best Director, Motion Picture. These five men are fine filmmakers (Nolan and del Toro are especially deserving of their nods). But there were several stellar films helmed by women this year, and the absence of at least one of their names on this list is glaring.Dee Rees (“Mudbound”), Greta Gerwig (“Lady Bird”) and Patty Jenkins (“Wonder Woman”) are the three snubs cited most since the 2018 nominations were announced on Monday. “Mudbound” received only two nominations (one Supporting Actress nomination for Mary J. Blige and one for Best Original Song For “Mighty River”). “Lady Bird” fared much better, with a Best Picture, Comedy or Musical nomination, a screenplay nomination for Gerwig and acting nominations for the movie’s heart and soul, Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf. Jenkins and “Wonder Woman” were completely shut out. Award shows are only relevant insofar as they provide an interesting portrait of the zeitgeist. We can debate all day about which movie is better than which or who deserved what trophy, but as a collective, these nominations and accolades are supposed to say something about the culture as a whole, and that’s perhaps the only thing that makes them worth talking about at all.But the Golden Globe nods for Best Director, oddly, don’t really reflect anything about the culture, about the present atmosphere, or about the future of great filmmakers. While all talented, the nominated directors as a collective are jarringly emblematic of the status quo in a time when Hollywood and the culture at large are under scrutiny for failing to challenge it― especially when it comes to men in power. The figure of the director, after all, is one of the ultimate symbols of power in Hollywood. Here are people who create a world that exists not only on the page but in their own minds, whose leadership, vision and authority are vital to a film.Perhaps aside from movie stars, we consider directors some of the most intriguing figures in the industry because of this power they wield. We’ve been conditioned to view stories about Alfred Hitchcock terrorizing his actresses or James Cameron terrorizing his crews as signs of genius, of mastery. We almost always admire these qualities only when they’re presented in the context of a difficult man at the helm. But right now, we’re in a cultural moment in which we’re questioning the sovereignty of difficult, powerful men. In the seemingly never-ending fallout from the accusations against producer Harvey Weinstein and amid conversations about power dynamics and who in Hollywood is given access to power, the 2018 Best Director nominations present a stark, backward-looking contrast to the current dialogue. To clarify: This isn’t about gender so much as it is about power. This isn’t to imply that any of the directors nominated have necessarily abused their power (especially in the ways numerous people say Weinstein has). This isn’t to say that because Hollywood is having a reckoning when it comes to misogyny and sexual assault, women should be recognized over men, regardless of merit. This isn’t even a question of calling out a simple lack of diversity, though it must be noted that women have only been nominated for Best Director seven times in the 75 years of the Globes, and only one of those women ― Ava DuVernay ― was a woman of color. Barbra Streisand is the only woman to have actually won the award. The problem here isn’t that five male directors were nominated. The problem is that these five men and their films were, quite frankly, not the best or most interesting or even most timely films of the year, at least not in the ways that “Lady Bird” (the best-reviewed film in the history of Rotten Tomatoes) and the critically acclaimed “Mudbound” were. It’s difficult to pinpoint what makes a movie like “All the Money in the World,” other than the scandal connected to it, relevant enough to be part of this year’s film conversation. And while “The Post” is certainly timely, its script and performances were far more compelling than Spielberg’s directing. These are all just things to consider. We’re challenging so many aspects of the industry when it comes to men and power, and then we go and nominate Ridley Scott for a merely adequate film when he’s directed far better. There’s a disconnect. The Best Director category highlights something that must be and should be considered: There’s much left to do to change a culture that breeds men like Weinstein. But one small thing that can be done is to subvert this idea of the all-powerful, infallible male filmmaker by recognizing women’s vision, instincts and points of view, particularly in a year when some of the best-directed films were made by them.

91,BUSINESS,New York City Just Recognized That It's Not Only Women Who Have To Change Diapers,Eleanor Goldberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nyc-changing-table-bill_us_5a2abb0ee4b073789f6945c0,A new bill will require all public restrooms in New York City to have diaper changing tables.,2017-12-11,New York City Council passed a bill on Monday that will require all public restrooms to have a changing station for parents to change their babies' diapers.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a2abba61900002500cca2f7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"New York City Council member Rafael Espinal doesn’t even have kids. But when he saw a dad leaning over a bathroom sink in a mall in Queens changing his baby’s diaper, Espinal was aghast. It also got him thinking.He couldn’t help but wonder if the neighboring women’s restroom was better equipped for parents’ needs, and if moms were having an easier time with their babies.“It was terrible to see a father changing his child’s diaper on top of a public sink where hundreds of people wash their hands after using the restroom,” Espinal told HuffPost. “Parents should be changing their children’s diapers with a little more dignity, in a space that’s sanitary.”After doing some investigation, he found that while women’s restrooms are far more likely to have a changing table than men’s bathrooms, that isn’t even always the case. One woman told Espinal she often changes her baby’s diaper on the floor of a public restroom, for lack of a better option.Now both dads and moms in New York City won’t have to worry about changing their kids in unsanitary conditions, thanks to legislation Espinal introduced requiring all new developments with public restrooms to install changing tables in both men’s and women’s bathrooms, which the council approved on Monday. Older buildings that don’t currently have changing tables will have to install them if they undergo renovations.This will include movie theaters, restaurants and coffee shops. Even restrooms in nightclubs will now be required to have changing tables. Espinal says it’s an affordable accommodation, as the changing tables themselves cost between $155 and $185. “It’s a low cost for a big benefit,” he said.He said he got no pushback from developers or lawmakers, even though the bill makes New York City the first major U.S. city to pass such legislation. There are no national rules requiring buildings to install changing tables in bathrooms. Businesses that do opt to include them often only put them in the women’s bathrooms ― a tacit implication that changing dirty diapers is a “woman’s” job. Not only does this perpetuate archaic stereotypes, it also fails to account for a very substantial population of parents and caregivers — single dads, gay dads, dads who are out with their kids for the day without mom, grandfathers, male babysitters and other men charged with watching over babies in diapers.Espinal said he thinks the bill was so well received because notable figures have already opened up a national conversation around the issue.Frustrated with being unable to change his daughter’s diaper in a sanitary way in public, actor Ashton Kutcher launched a Change.org petition in 2015, urging businesses to install changing tables.“Families are diverse, and it is an injustice to assume it’s only a woman’s job to handle changing diapers,” Kutcher wrote in the petition at the time. “This assumption is gender stereotyping and companies should be supporting all parents that shop at their stores equally — no matter their gender.”Kutcher launched his mission after California Governor Jerry Brown shot down legislation in 2014 that would’ve accomplished what’s been dubbed “potty parity.” The governor vetoed two bills that would’ve required businesses to provide a baby changing station in a men’s room if one was provided in the women’s room. Businesses could’ve also opted to build one changing area in a restroom available to men and women.“This may be a good business practice, but not one that I am inclined to legislate,” Brown said at the time, according to the Los Angeles Times. Last year, President Barack Obama brought a fresh perspective to the issue when he signed the Bathrooms Accessible in Every Situation Act. It required all federally owned buildings to have changing stations in both men’s and women’s restrooms. Espinal hopes that after his bill takes off, that other cities will follow suit. And that it will help continue to encourage families to divide parenting tasks, when possible.“I don’t think the burden should just be on women,” Espinal said of changing diapers. “Men should step up and be on diaper duty as well.”"
92,BUSINESS,New York City Just Recognized That It's Not Only Women Who Have To Change Diapers,Eleanor Goldberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nyc-changing-table-bill_us_5a2abb0ee4b073789f6945c0,A new bill will require all public restrooms in New York City to have diaper changing tables.,2017-12-11,"“Parents should be changing their children’s diapers with a little more dignity, in a space that’s sanitary,"" said council member Rafael Espinal, who introduced the bill. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a2acf141e00003b000c2d55.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"New York City Council member Rafael Espinal doesn’t even have kids. But when he saw a dad leaning over a bathroom sink in a mall in Queens changing his baby’s diaper, Espinal was aghast. It also got him thinking.He couldn’t help but wonder if the neighboring women’s restroom was better equipped for parents’ needs, and if moms were having an easier time with their babies.“It was terrible to see a father changing his child’s diaper on top of a public sink where hundreds of people wash their hands after using the restroom,” Espinal told HuffPost. “Parents should be changing their children’s diapers with a little more dignity, in a space that’s sanitary.”After doing some investigation, he found that while women’s restrooms are far more likely to have a changing table than men’s bathrooms, that isn’t even always the case. One woman told Espinal she often changes her baby’s diaper on the floor of a public restroom, for lack of a better option.Now both dads and moms in New York City won’t have to worry about changing their kids in unsanitary conditions, thanks to legislation Espinal introduced requiring all new developments with public restrooms to install changing tables in both men’s and women’s bathrooms, which the council approved on Monday. Older buildings that don’t currently have changing tables will have to install them if they undergo renovations.This will include movie theaters, restaurants and coffee shops. Even restrooms in nightclubs will now be required to have changing tables. Espinal says it’s an affordable accommodation, as the changing tables themselves cost between $155 and $185. “It’s a low cost for a big benefit,” he said.He said he got no pushback from developers or lawmakers, even though the bill makes New York City the first major U.S. city to pass such legislation. There are no national rules requiring buildings to install changing tables in bathrooms. Businesses that do opt to include them often only put them in the women’s bathrooms ― a tacit implication that changing dirty diapers is a “woman’s” job. Not only does this perpetuate archaic stereotypes, it also fails to account for a very substantial population of parents and caregivers — single dads, gay dads, dads who are out with their kids for the day without mom, grandfathers, male babysitters and other men charged with watching over babies in diapers.Espinal said he thinks the bill was so well received because notable figures have already opened up a national conversation around the issue.Frustrated with being unable to change his daughter’s diaper in a sanitary way in public, actor Ashton Kutcher launched a Change.org petition in 2015, urging businesses to install changing tables.“Families are diverse, and it is an injustice to assume it’s only a woman’s job to handle changing diapers,” Kutcher wrote in the petition at the time. “This assumption is gender stereotyping and companies should be supporting all parents that shop at their stores equally — no matter their gender.”Kutcher launched his mission after California Governor Jerry Brown shot down legislation in 2014 that would’ve accomplished what’s been dubbed “potty parity.” The governor vetoed two bills that would’ve required businesses to provide a baby changing station in a men’s room if one was provided in the women’s room. Businesses could’ve also opted to build one changing area in a restroom available to men and women.“This may be a good business practice, but not one that I am inclined to legislate,” Brown said at the time, according to the Los Angeles Times. Last year, President Barack Obama brought a fresh perspective to the issue when he signed the Bathrooms Accessible in Every Situation Act. It required all federally owned buildings to have changing stations in both men’s and women’s restrooms. Espinal hopes that after his bill takes off, that other cities will follow suit. And that it will help continue to encourage families to divide parenting tasks, when possible.“I don’t think the burden should just be on women,” Espinal said of changing diapers. “Men should step up and be on diaper duty as well.”"

Berit Reiss-Andersen, leader of the Nobel Committee, stands to the left.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a2d9ac01e000027000c30db.jpeg?cache=Fw9TDizroH&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Total nuclear destruction is “only one impulsive tantrum away,” this year’s Nobel Peace Prize winner warned while accepting the award for an international anti-nuclear weapons campaign.“The threat is real. We have avoided nuclear war not through prudent leadership but good fortune. Sooner or later, if we fail to act, our luck will run out,” Beatrice Fihn, executive director of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), said during a ceremony in Oslo on Sunday.“The risk for nuclear weapons use is even greater today than at the end of the Cold War. But unlike the Cold War, today we face many more nuclear-armed states, terrorists and cyber warfare,” she said. “A moment of panic or carelessness, a misconstrued comment or bruised ego, could easily lead us unavoidably to the destruction of entire cities.”ICAN has since its 2007 establishment worked to draw attention to the catastrophic consequences of nuclear weapons and promote a treaty-based prohibition of them, according to the Nobel Prize’s website.During a news conference on Saturday about ICAN’s work, Fihn included mention of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and President Donald Trump, who in recent months have engaged in mutual verbal threats and name calling over Pyonyang’s nuclear weapons program.“These weapons do not make us safe, they are not a deterrent, they only spur other states to pursue their own nuclear weapons,” Fihn said, according to The Associated Press. “If you are not comfortable with Kim Jong-un having nuclear weapons, then you are not comfortable with nuclear weapons. If you’re not comfortable with Donald Trump having nuclear weapons, then you are not comfortable with nuclear weapons.”On Sunday, Fihn accepted the prestigious award alongside atomic bomb survivor Setsuko Thurlow, who recalled climbing out of rubble toward the light after the U.S. dropped an atomic bomb on her city of Hiroshima, Japan, in 1945.Thurlow, while recalling that life or death moment at the age of 13, urged countries to sign the international Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.“Our light now is the ban treaty,” Thurlow said, according to the AP. “I repeat those words that I heard called to me in the ruins of Hiroshima: ‘Don’t give up. Keep pushing. See the light? Crawl toward it.’”In a speech on Sunday, Berit Reiss-Andersen, chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, stressed that the nuclear weapons that instantly killed at least 140,000 people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki ― and later many more by radiation ― are not as destructive as the ones we have today.“A nuclear war could kill millions of people, dramatically alter the climate and the environment for much of the planet, and destabilize societies in a way never before seen by humanity. The notion of a limited nuclear war is an illusion,” she said. The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons has been signed by 56 countries, none of which have nuclear weapons. It has been ratified by just three. In order for it to become a binding agreement, it needs ratification by 50 countries, Reiss-Andersen said."
