2,WORLD NEWS,How Defamation Laws In Australia Could Stop An All-Out ‘Weinstein Moment’,"Josh Butler, HuffPost",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/australia-weinstein-defamation-laws_us_5a37fe97e4b0ff955ad56302,"So far, few high-profile figures have been caught in the #MeToo maelstrom Down Under.",2017-12-18,Women take part in a #MeToo protest march in Los Angeles.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a37ff58160000783ecf1dbb.jpeg?cache=Xd3NUiHm0n&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"SYDNEY ― Strict anti-defamation laws that have a “chilling effect” on journalism may prevent Australia from experiencing its own “Weinstein moment” exposing a multitude of high-profile sex offenders, Australian legal experts say.From Harvey Weinstein to Kevin Spacey, Mario Batali to Louis C.K. to Al Franken, a string of American celebrities and politicians have faced public allegations of sexual violence, harassment and misconduct in recent months. But in Australia, far fewer high-profile figures have been caught in a similar maelstrom. So far, celebrity TV gardener Don Burke has been the only famous personality to be targeted, with a long list of women, including former employees of his high-rated primetime program, accusing him of lewd comments and inappropriate behavior.Legal experts say that Australia’s defamation laws, which are far stricter than those in the United States, and Australia’s lack of a constitutionally guaranteed right to free speech mean that a Weinstein-level moment of reckoning is less likely to occur.Journalists in Australia are forced to be far more cautious to avoid being sued and may be reluctant to report similar stories in their own backyard, said professor David Rolph of the University of Sydney Law School.“It is fairly notorious that defamation law in Australia has a chilling effect on investigative journalism and reporting more generally. It’s something that inhibits reporting,” he told HuffPost, adding, “The risks of defaming someone are higher.”The U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment provides a level of protection for the media that Australians don’t have, Rolph said. In particular, he pointed to the “public figure” doctrine in the U.S., which requires plaintiffs who are prominent individuals to prove that a report was both false and published with “actual malice.” By contrast, he said, Australia’s system is “pro-plaintiff.”“The U.S. has the defamation laws most protective of free speech in the common law world, which opens up the scope of reporting and journalism,” Rolph explained. “In Australia, the plaintiff doesn’t have to prove [the allegation] is false; the defendant has to prove it is true.”Media reports said that Burke, the celebrity TV gardener, retained a high-profile defamation lawyer before the first press stories on his alleged behavior even surfaced in November.Actor Geoffrey Rush began legal proceedings against Sydney’s Daily Telegraph newspaper after recent stories alleged that he had engaged in inappropriate behavior during a recent theater production. The legal claim filed by Rush’s lawyers not only objects to the reporting of the allegations, which the “Pirates of the Caribbean” actor denied, but also the fact that the articles linked Rush to the likes of Weinstein.Australia’s defamation law applies not only to the claims directly outlined in media reports, but also to inferences that a reasonable person could draw from that reporting, explained professor Barbara McDonald, who also works at the University of Sydney Law School.“It’s one thing to say someone sexually assaulted someone else, another to imply they are a serial assaulter,” she said. “It’s a matter of what implication the reasonable person would draw, so you have to defend that as well as the literal one.”The Australian legal system also lacks a “broad public interest defense,” McDonald said, and it’s overall “very easy” for defamation to be claimed in court.“The burden is on the defendant to prove the truth. It’s almost a presumption that a defamatory allegation is false and goes to the defendant to prove it is true,” she said.Phil Johnston, a defamation lawyer with leading firm Slater and Gordon, called this focus on not only the contents of any reporting but the implications that could be drawn a “quirk” of Australia’s legal system.He cited the case of actress Rebel Wilson, who successfully sued an Australian magazine publisher for running a series of articles that claimed she was a serial liar. In September she was awarded AU$4.56 million (about US$3.5 million), the highest defamation payout in Australian history. This award included AU$3.91 million (about US$3 million) in special damages for “financial loss,” after her lawyers argued that her career had suffered and she had missed out on film roles due to the articles.“Newspapers and media in general are very switched on to this,” Johnston said. “The Rebel Wilson case is a good example of the judiciary coming down hard on them, and that has set the tone for the next few years in this sphere.”"

7,POLITICS,Alabama Deserves To Have Its Voice Heard On The Tax Bill,"Rep. Terri Sewell, ContributorRep. Terri A.

As I",2017-12-18,<p>Doug Jones’ election means that Alabama will again have two duly-elected lawmakers in the Senate</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a37f289160000fc11cf1d71.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For many of us in Alabama, Senator-elect Doug Jones’ victory last Tuesday meant much more than a political victory. As I said on the campaign trail, help is on the way – help defending health care, help advocating for real tax reform, and help fighting for our state’s working families. But as House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell rush to pass a hastily-written tax bill, that help may arrive too late for the most important vote this Congress will take.It was nearly a year ago when now-Attorney General Jeff Sessions vacated one of Alabama’s two senate seats, making way for this year’s special election. In his place, Sen. Luther Strange was appointed to the Senate by Alabama Governor Robert Bentley, who has since resigned.This year, our unelected senator has taken 258 votes, including consequential changes to the tax code, sweeping changes to the healthcare system, and lifetime appointments of federal judges. The decisions the Senate has made this year will impact Alabama families for generations to come, but the voters of Alabama did not have a duly-elected voice in the Senate when those decisions were made.Also at stake are the issues the Senate has failed to take up for a vote in the first place. This year, Congress let funding expire for the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and for Perkins federal student loans. The lives of “dreamers” - children of undocumented immigrants who are working to make the United States stronger – also hang in the balance.While there are no do-overs for votes that Senator-elect Doug Jones was not present for, the Senate can show that it still shares basic democratic values by holding off consideration of the GOP tax bill until our duly elected Senator is seated.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell should understand the need to wait for Jones’ swearing in. After all, he made the same argument when former Sen. Scott Brown won a special election for one of Massachusetts’s Senate seats. As the Senate considered passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, McConnell urged the Senate to delay the legislation until Brown could be seated for a vote.There was even bipartisan agreement that, after Brown won his election in Massachusetts, he should be a part of any further healthcare votes going through the Senate. “The Senate certainly shouldn’t try to jam anything through until Scott Brown is seated,” President Barack Obama told a reporter the day after Brown won his special election. “The people in Massachusetts spoke. He’s got to be part of that process.”In 2016, after Merrick Garland’s nomination to the Supreme Court, the Senate Majority Leader delayed any vote on the Supreme Court’s vacancy until after the 2016 elections. “The American people are perfectly capable of having their say on this issue,” said McConnell, “so let’s give them a voice.”Alabama voters are very capable of having a say in our national decisions as well, and last Tuesday they showed that they wanted their voices to be heard by turning out in record numbers for our state’s special election.Suspending consideration of the GOP tax bill until Senator-elect Doug Jones is seated also gives our lawmakers and the public a chance to read the tax bill before it gets voted on. During the last Senate vote on the tax bill, the text of the bill wasn’t revealed until the night of, with last-minute changes written into the bill’s margins.If this Congress is serious about real reform, the tax bill should be considered in a deliberative and democratic process where the public’s voice is heard. The Senate can begin that process now, by seating Jones before moving the bill forward in the Senate.For working families in Alabama, help and a voice in the U.S. Senate, is on the way. Out of respect for my constituents and the democratic process, I urge the Senate to delay action on the tax bill until our state’s newest Senator has a seat at the table."
8,WORLD NEWS,Same-Sex Weddings Begin In Australia,Eoin Blackwell,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/same-sex-weddings-australia_us_5a378bd7e4b040881bec0362,Congrats to all!,2017-12-18,Lauren Price and Amy Laker were among the first LGBT couples to be able to legally marry in Australia.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a378e391600002100c50807.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"SYDNEY ― Australians have started celebrating same-sex weddings even earlier than expected.Couples in Australia are supposed to notify the government at least a month before they get married, which meant the first same-sex weddings would take place on Jan. 9 ― one month after Australia became the 25th country to legalize same-sex marriage. But some couples were able to forgo the waiting period due to extenuating circumstances ― if family had already traveled from far away, for example, or financial hardship.Sydney couple Lauren Price and Amy Laker tied the knot on Saturday, becoming the first gay couple to marry in the southeastern state of New South Wales.“This day was already planned anyway [as a commitment ceremony], but it wasn’t legal, so it was great that it was passed through early,” Laker told 9NEWS. The couple got an exemption from the 30-day requirement for financial reasons.The Australian government in 2004 passed an amendment defining marriage as a union between a man and a woman. That changed this month, when lawmakers overwhelmingly voted to legalize same-sex marriage. “Marriage, according to the law in Australia, is a union of two people, to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life,” marriage celebrant Janice Bradley reportedly said during Laker and Price’s ceremony.In Melbourne, Amy and Elise McDonald on Saturday had a surprise wedding in front of about 60 unsuspecting guests in the city’s Carlton Gardens. They originally planned for a commitment ceremony, but realized at the last minute they were eligible for an exemption on financial grounds, the couple told the Herald Sun. Elise’s family had flown from Asia and the United Arab Emirates for the ceremony. “We were always going to have a ceremony but to have it legalized is very special,” Elise McDonald said. Another Melbourne couple, Stephanie Dyball and Megan Stapleton, booked their wedding — set for Thursday — months ago because they were sick of waiting for Australia’s law to change.“We got engaged in 2012 — so quite a while ago,” Stapleton said. “We waited and waited and we got a bit tired of waiting and thought, ‘We’re not going to wait around any more for them to change the law, let’s just have a wedding.’”Other ceremonies this week are more bittersweet. Lyn Hawkins, who is in the late stages of ovarian cancer, on Sunday wed her partner of nearly 40 years, Anne Sedgwick.“Anne has been very supportive through all this and marrying her, it’s Anne’s way of saying, ‘Let’s finally do this,’” Hawkins said. Cas Willow, 53, and Heather Richards, 56, on Monday wed at at Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, where Willow is receiving treatment for breast cancer that has spread to her brain.“Just because time is not on our side, it’s just a dream come true,” Willow told SBS."
9,ENTERTAINMENT,Major Networks Are Becoming More Inclusive Of Asian-Americans: Report,Kimberly Yam,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/aapi-report-card-tv-networks_us_5a31778de4b01bdd765980ee,"Fox, however, had the fewest Asian-American regulars in its shows in almost a decade.",2017-12-18,"Constance Wu (Jessica) and Randall Park (Louis) in ABC's sitcom ""Fresh Off the Boat.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a37f976150000144449c4bb.jpeg?cache=oevP1RVU6T&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Major television networks have more work to do to ensure that Asian-Americans become a regular part of the mainstream media landscape, new analysis suggests.But things are looking up. The Asian Pacific American Media Coalition (APAMC) released a report card last week evaluating four major television networks on their progress in the minority group’s representation. Most networks exhibited improvements, with ABC scoring the highest. But Fox was given an “incomplete” for failing to provide data for the report. What’s more, Fox had the fewest Asian-American regulars in its shows since almost a decade ago, according to the coalition’s numbers. However, with clear gains made in diversity compared with seasons past, Daniel Mayeda, chair of the APAMC, said in an email that he’s optimistic about the future of TV.“Television has made good progress,” Mayeda told HuffPost of the results of the report, which also evaluated CBS and NBC. “The fact that there are now a solid base of Asian American writers and producers is a good sign for continued future inclusion of [Asian-American and Pacific Islander] talent and stories.”The coalition evaluated networks in several categories, including the numbers of Asian-American and Pacific Islander actors, the numbers of writers and producers, and the organizations’ commitment to diversity. Each network was then given an overall grade. While ABC was awarded an overall B score, the report noted that it received a respectable A- in the category of actors. With its 21 Asian-American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) series regulars along with 23 recurring characters, ABC set new records in casting, according to APAMC. Three of its shows featured Asian leads, including “Quantico,” “Fresh Off the Boat” and “Dr. Ken,” which was canceled this year. The report shows that CBS received an overall B- score and NBC a C+. Though the two networks got lower marks when it came to the numbers of AAPI actors along with writers and producers, the APAMC noted that progress could be on the horizon. Both networks have programs with more inclusive casts and executives in development. Among other shows, NBC is working on a series with a Sikh-American lead. And CBS is developing a comedy about an Asian-American rookie professional basketball player. As for Fox, Mayeda explained that the network initially did not fully comply with an agreement meant to spur progress in diversity. The major networks had all signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Multi-Ethnic Media Coalition (MEMC), which includes several civil rights and minority nonprofits, and in part stipulates that networks provide data for the report. “Fox has a new team installed to advance diversity and inclusion. I am not sure they understood the importance of the MOUs or the role advocacy groups such as ours play in the process to hold the networks accountable and to work in partnership with them to meet our mutual goals,” Mayeda said. But it seems that the network has had a change of heart. “I think we now have their attention,” the chair said. “They have now begun providing us data, and we will be working with them to ensure that there is a good baseline of data against which to measure progress.” According to the coalition’s own research, Fox had only six AAPI regulars in the 2016-2017 television season. And most of the network’s series that contained AAPI regulars, including “New Girl” and “Sleepy Hollow,” were canceled. Yet it remains to be seen whether shows featuring more actors from the minority group will take their place.With none of the four networks given perfect overall scores, the report card will hopefully help show that the progress that’s been made doesn’t mean the industry is fully inclusive, Mayeda said. “It is not enough to be the sidekick character who makes the white star more interesting, or the Asian American boss who acts stern and mutters a few lines every few episodes,” Mayeda told HuffPost. “In particular, we want to be able to tell our own stories [and] ideally be the stars of the shows or, at least, have prominent lead roles so that we have storylines that revolve around our lives.”Past research indicates clear areas in need of improvement. A study on Asian-Americans’ representation in television reveals that characters of Asian descent are still often tokenized on the small screen. There’s still a huge chunk of shows that don’t have an Asian presence at all, and many shows that boasted many AAPI series regulars have been canceled. But with proof that headway is possible, it’s up to Hollywood to continue stepping up to the plate. “In an ideal world, there are enough different kinds of representations of AAPI characters and stories that viewers will come to know Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders as real Americans, with lives that are relatable,” Mayeda said.

Local governments are already subsidizing the world's largest online retailer -- through its ever-growing fulfillment network.,2017-12-18,Critics of the tax breaks say governments are funding the demise of their own local retailers by subsidizing Amazon’s growth.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a3446ca150000490049bf79.png?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"BALTIMORE, Md. ― Joshua Geathers spent two exhausting years inside an Amazon warehouse complex in Southeast Baltimore. He worked first as a packer, bundling shipments to go out for delivery, and later supervised for quality control, eventually earning $14.70 an hour. The position paid better than his previous job at Staples, but he was often so drained after working that he used his paid time off just to sleep and recover.“I felt tired all the time,” said the 24-year-old Geathers, who lives within walking distance of two adjacent Amazon facilities. He found he sometimes had to run to complete his tasks on time, even though the warehouse had a strict policy against running for safety reasons. “I’m a hardworking person, and I don’t complain about hard work,” Geathers said. “But it’s a very strenuous job.”Cities and states around the country, including Baltimore and Maryland, are now jockeying to become home to Amazon’s next headquarters, branded HQ2. Local government officials have proposed massive tax breaks for the online retailer. And the desperate bids to attract tens of thousands of tech jobs through the subsidies is giving corporate watchdogs heartburn. But Amazon has already been benefiting from public subsidies for years, in exchange for warehouse jobs like Geathers’ that pay far less than headquarter jobs.Geathers’ experience may not be what Baltimore officials had in mind when they put together a juicy package of financial incentives to lure Amazon to the area in 2013. They offered the world’s largest online retailer $43 million in tax credits, a generous public subsidy even by Amazon standards. Then-Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake boasted at the time that “one thousand jobs is nothing to sneeze at.” Tax incentives like those in Maryland have helped fuel Amazon’s rapid growth of its distribution network. In 2015 and 2016 alone, local governments committed roughly a quarter of a billion dollars in subsidies to Amazon facilities, according to Good Jobs First, a progressive nonprofit that tracks subsidy awards. Amazon raked in another $600 million in the decade leading up to 2015, the group found. In many cases, government officials offered the tax breaks with little or no public discussion about wages or working conditions. As the retailer expands to new areas in its effort to dominate same-day delivery, more cities and counties will have to ask themselves: How much public money is an Amazon warehouse job really worth?“The jobs Amazon creates in these warehouses are not good jobs. Even the direct hires are relatively low paid, and the work is grueling,” said Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a nonprofit that’s been critical of tax subsidies for large national retailers. “The notion that investing this kind of money in an Amazon warehouse is a long-term economic development strategy is really incorrect.”Amazon says its contributions to the Maryland economy are well worth the taxpayer investments. The company has put a billion dollars in its operations and now has 5,000 full-time employees in the state, according to data provided by Amazon. It recently inked a deal to open an additional Baltimore area fulfillment center, where it expects to employ another 1,500 people.The first Baltimore facility is emblematic of major shifts in the U.S. economy, as manufacturing jobs have given way to retail and service work. For seven decades the site was home to a General Motors plant, providing good-paying union jobs for the city’s working class. The last van rolled off the assembly line in 2005, when the plant closed and laid off 1,100 workers. City and state officials spent years looking for a company to breathe life into the 2.8-million square-foot site.With the rise of online retail, fulfillment centers have become a natural fit for post-industrial plants now sitting idle. The typical warehouse occupies a million square feet and employs between 1,000 and 3,000 workers. But the positions don’t necessarily have the same middle-class trappings as a GM manufacturing job.An Amazon spokesman said its fulfillment center workers receive “highly competitive wages” that pay “on average 30 percent more than traditional retail jobs,” a figure consistent with worker interviews. The average retail salesperson in the U.S. earns $10.90 per hour, according to the Labor Department, while low-level Amazon warehouse workers said they earn between $13 and $15 per hour in Maryland, where the minimum wage is $8.75. But the work is far more physically demanding ― after all, these are warehouse jobs, not retail jobs. And in many cases, the positions still don’t pay enough to sustain a family. Of the half-dozen workers HuffPost interviewed who’d cycled through the Baltimore location, all earned wages that equated to annual salaries in the mid- to high-$20,000s. “It’s not a lot of money, but it beats McDonald’s or Wendy’s,” explained Nigel Hammett, who worked in the Baltimore facility last holiday season. Many workers end up at Amazon fulfillment centers as temps whose jobs may end at any moment, employed by outside firms that offer lesser benefits than direct hires receive.Still, local governments find the prospect of Amazon warehouse jobs hard to resist, particularly in down-and-out neighborhoods. In the case of Baltimore, many of the city’s longtime residents have been left behind in the now-booming regional economy. The unemployment rate for African-Americans in the city is three times that of whites, and the median household income for an African-American family is around $34,000, according to one analysis. Only 13 percent of African-American adults in the city have a Bachelor’s degree or higher.Sierra Singleton wound up at the Baltimore Amazon facility in 2015 for the same reason many others do: It was the best job she could find. She was 22 at the time and had no fixed address. She was poor enough to be grateful for the free T-shirt that came with the job. She started out at $13.00 per hour, as opposed to the $8.50 of her previous job, and got 50 cents more per hour for working overnight shifts. She eventually got her own one-bedroom apartment near the fulfillment center.There were some things Singleton didn’t like about the facility. Many of the best supervisory positions seemed to go to people who weren’t from Baltimore, and the job was so taxing that she eventually had to move on after two years. “I was pushing my body past its limits,” she said. Still, she credits the company with keeping a roof over her head, and she left on good terms in November, in case she ever wants to return. Amazon’s arrival, in her estimation, has been a good thing for Southeast Baltimore.“I got a place because of this job. I could afford living somewhere outside of Section 8,” Singleton said, referring to federally subsidized housing. “Being able to pay my bills and stay above water, it was definitely because of Amazon.” Singleton’s experience helps explain why so many cities and counties offer subsidies for Amazon warehouses: They fear much-needed jobs will go somewhere else. But critics of the tax breaks say governments are funding the demise of their own local retailers by subsidizing Amazon’s growth. They also argue that officials are giving away money in exchange for fulfillment centers that would be built in the same regions anyway, regardless of subsidies, given Amazon’s same-day delivery aspirations. Amazon’s goal of delivering to its customers within mere hours requires more and more warehouses, and not just in the more rural, low-cost areas where it built many of its earliest. The company is bringing fulfillment jobs to dense coastal areas like Baltimore because its business plan compels it to.Greg LeRoy, the director of Good Jobs First, the nonprofit that tracks public subsidies, said local and state governments have their strategy backwards. “Amazon should be paying to arrive, not getting paid to arrive,” said LeRoy. “We’re just maddened by it.”Some of the subsidies for Amazon warehouses are less than a million dollars a piece. But in Ohio, the company netted $17 million for two facilities; in Wisconsin, $32 million for one, according to Good Jobs First. A Jacksonville, Fla., warehouse came with a total of $27 million in subsidies. The largest so far was Baltimore. Most of these subsidies come in the form of corporate income tax credits, property tax abatements, infrastructure improvements and tax increment financing. The bulk of Amazon’s subsidies in Baltimore came as state “enterprise zone” credits reserved for investments in struggling areas. The retailer qualified for those funds by using the old GM site. Officials also provided the company with more than $1 million in loans that would be forgiven in 10 years so long as the company maintained certain staffing levels and had at least $175 million invested in the facility. There were no requirements related to wages, and officials said they weren’t especially concerned about reports out of Pennsylvania that Amazon warehouse workers were being hospitalized for heat exhaustion.A spokeswoman for Maryland’s commerce department said Amazon must provide the state with documentation on its job count at the end of each year. So far, the retailer has exceeded its obligations on the employment front, creating more jobs than required.Enrico Moretti, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said communities are playing a “zero sum game” when they compete to lure a fulfillment center to the area, since the facility is going to end up somewhere. “With the subsidies, they are essentially giving away some of the benefits that the fulfillment center would generate for the community,” he said. Still, he noted, tax breaks like the ones for Amazon in Baltimore can seem small when compared to deals for manufacturing plants, for which governments often shell out hundreds of thousands of dollars per job.That’s because the ancillary benefits of a fulfillment center can seem small, Moretti said. A major manufacturing plant could attract additional suppliers, and Amazon’s next headquarters could attract more tech companies and high-paying jobs. But “there’s not going to be a wave of tech startups because there’s an Amazon fulfillment center,” he added.Many areas have been reluctant to attach strings to their Amazon arrangements related to working conditions. An analysis done of fulfillment center deals by the Business Journals network turned up instances where officials actually waived wage requirements for Amazon that would normally apply to other corporations, just so Amazon could secure the subsidies at stake. “Their rationale, repeated by local officials interviewed by The Business Journals: Any job is better than no job,” the site reported. Even though the subsidies are predicated on jobs, Amazon won’t always need the workers that it does now. Warehouses are becoming increasingly automated, with robots performing tasks that humans were responsible for just months ago. These advancements make warehouse work less tedious and stressful, freeing up workers to supervise machines that do the heavy lifting. But the new efficiencies also translate into fewer jobs, particularly less skilled ones. Joshua Geathers didn’t stick around the Baltimore warehouse long enough to see robots take anybody’s job. He left Amazon last year and now works as a field technician for a data services firm, making around $9 more per hour than he did at the warehouse. He’s grateful not to be in the fulfillment center in the runup to the holidays. He found that trying to build a career there required a certain degree of desperation. “It’s a place where one would work if they were in dire need of money,” he said.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story incorrectly reported the number of full-time Amazon workers in Maryland. It is 5,000."

The bulk of Amazon’s subsidies in Baltimore came as state “enterprise zone” credits reserved for investments in struggling areas. The retailer qualified for those funds by using the old GM site. Officials also provided the company with more than $1 million in loans that would be forgiven in 10 years so long as the company maintained certain staffing levels and had at least $175 million invested in the facility. There were no requirements related to wages, and officials said they weren’t especially concerned about reports out of Pennsylvania that Amazon warehouse workers were being hospitalized for heat exhaustion.A spokeswoman for Maryland’s commerce department said Amazon must provide the state with documentation on its job count at the end of each year. So far, the retailer has exceeded its obligations on the employment front, creating more jobs than required.Enrico Moretti, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said communities are playing a “zero sum game” when they compete to lure a fulfillment center to the area, since the facility is going to end up somewhere. “With the subsidies, they are essentially giving away some of the benefits that the fulfillment center would generate for the community,” he said. Still, he noted, tax breaks like the ones for Amazon in Baltimore can seem small when compared to deals for manufacturing plants, for which governments often shell out hundreds of thousands of dollars per job.That’s because the ancillary benefits of a fulfillment center can seem small, Moretti said. A major manufacturing plant could attract additional suppliers, and Amazon’s next headquarters could attract more tech companies and high-paying jobs. But “there’s not going to be a wave of tech startups because there’s an Amazon fulfillment center,” he added.Many areas have been reluctant to attach strings to their Amazon arrangements related to working conditions. An analysis done of fulfillment center deals by the Business Journals network turned up instances where officials actually waived wage requirements for Amazon that would normally apply to other corporations, just so Amazon could secure the subsidies at stake. “Their rationale, repeated by local officials interviewed by The Business Journals: Any job is better than no job,” the site reported. Even though the subsidies are predicated on jobs, Amazon won’t always need the workers that it does now. Warehouses are becoming increasingly automated, with robots performing tasks that humans were responsible for just months ago. These advancements make warehouse work less tedious and stressful, freeing up workers to supervise machines that do the heavy lifting. But the new efficiencies also translate into fewer jobs, particularly less skilled ones. Joshua Geathers didn’t stick around the Baltimore warehouse long enough to see robots take anybody’s job. He left Amazon last year and now works as a field technician for a data services firm, making around $9 more per hour than he did at the warehouse. He’s grateful not to be in the fulfillment center in the runup to the holidays. He found that trying to build a career there required a certain degree of desperation. “It’s a place where one would work if they were in dire need of money,” he said.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story incorrectly reported the number of full-time Amazon workers in Maryland. It is 5,000."
14,WOMEN,Glenn Close On Weinstein Effect: 'To Condemn All Men Is Stupid And Counterproductive',Alanna Vagianos,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/glenn-close-weinstein_us_5a37d54fe4b01d429ccaae10,"The actress partially blamed ""male DNA"" for predatory behavior.",2017-12-18,"Glenn Close spoke to Jezebel about her upcoming movie ""Crooked House"" and the wave of sexual misconduct allegations against powerful men.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a37d686160000563fcf1cd4.jpeg?cache=44L39v5bDt&ops=crop_112_84_4816_2727%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Glenn Close hopes people in the entertainment industry can learn from the reckoning of sexual harassment and assault in Hollywood. The 70-year-old actress recently sat down with Jezebel alongside “Crooked House” co-star Max Irons to discuss the upcoming thriller and the recent wave of sexual misconduct allegations against Hollywood heavyweights, like Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey. Close said she was never “preyed upon” by Weinstein, but said he was “known to be a pig.” The producer has been accused of sexual misconduct, ranging from harassment to assault and rape, by more than 60 women. Throughout the interview, Close partially blamed biology for predatory behavior, and pointed to “the male DNA.” “As more and more people are being exposed and more and more women are being able to come up and say they were abused or preyed upon, I feel that it’s kind of in the male DNA, that if somebody walks in the room, your first thought is, ‘Do I want to fuck her?’ Honestly speaking,” she said. “Women maybe, but not to the same degree. If you expect that to change, I think it’s stupid.”Close issued a statement to The New York Times shortly after the paper reported misconduct allegations against Weinstein. “I’m sitting here, deeply upset, acknowledging to myself that, yes, for many years, I have been aware of the vague rumors that Harvey Weinstein had a pattern of behaving inappropriately around women,” she wrote in the statement. “Harvey has always been decent to me, but now that the rumors are being substantiated, I feel angry and darkly sad.”Close told Jezebel she was initially angry because women have been repeatedly put in situations where powerful men can and do take advantage of them.“I can put myself into the shoes of a young girl who has no defenses and I’ve learned that there’s fight, flight, and freeze,” Close said. “People say, ‘Why didn’t you just ...’ I can see where you’re in this room and you don’t know the rules. It’s terrifying.” Now, Close said, she’s moved away from feeling angry and sad; instead, she hopes for change. “I hope this is a tipping point and I hope it will represent a social revolution. Evolution,” she said. “Because the only way I think it won’t keep happening is if we evolve to a different place. It takes both and women. There are men who have acted on it, and men who don’t. To condemn all men is stupid and counterproductive, but just to say, ‘Okay, we’re biological creatures and this is a natural instinct, but we have a social contract.’ And this can, hopefully, evolve into a new culture for us.” Head over to Jezebel to read the full interview.

Soon it will be midnight ― and extinction.”Once widespread in Asia, stalking vast swathes of the continent from the Middle East to eastern India, the Asiatic cheetah was almost wiped out in the 20th century by overhunting and habitat degradation, among other threats. Today, fewer than 50 individuals are believed to remain in the wild ― all of them in Iran — and that number continues to plummet each year.Cars, poachers and local herders are currently the biggest threats facing the subspecies, according to conservationists.“Farmers and their dogs kill them to protect their herds,” Hooman Jokar, managing director of Iran’s Asiatic cheetah conservation program, told Agence France Presse earlier this year.Photographs show cheetahs as roadkill in Iran, run over on highways despite signs warning drivers to look out for the animal. The situation may seem dire for the Asiatic cheetah, considered a critically endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, but conservationists say it could be a lot worse. If not for a conservation program launched by the Iranian government in 2001 with support from the U.N. Development Program aimed at protecting the animal and its habitat, the Asiatic cheetah would have “totally disappeared from Iran” by now, Jokar told the AFP.The program helped to designate protected areas, establish a network of dozens of specially-trained park wardens and provide the cheetahs with sufficient natural prey.Campaigns have also been launched to raise awareness about the animal’s plight, including putting images of the cheetah on the jerseys of the Iranian national soccer team for the 2014 World Cup.Earlier this year, Iranian actress Hedieh Tehrani spearheaded a fundraising effort to help relocate farms so conflicts between farmers and cheetahs are reduced. But the successful cheetah initiative now faces a major challenge in the looming funding shortfall.The UNDP, which says it’s pumped some $800,000 into the program to date, will no longer support the initiative.“Unfortunately, due to budget challenges, UNDP is unable to extend the project beyond [December 2017],” an agency spokesperson told The Observer. Now, it’ll be up to Iran to continue running the program on its own.But with a significant chunk of funding gone, experts worry about the fate of the Asiatic cheetah. Iranian officials said earlier this month that the program will have to be funded from the country’s “tight” Department of Environment budget, the Tehran Times reported. In a letter published in the journal Nature earlier this month, conservationists Jamshid Parchizadeh and Samual Williams urged Iran “not to give up on cheetah conservation” and encouraged the global community to support efforts to save the imperiled subspecies. “Bringing the Asiatic cheetah back from the brink of extinction will require close cooperation between governmental organizations, non-governmental organizations and grass-roots stakeholders. The government’s wholehearted support is crucial,” the conservationists wrote.Asiatic and African cheetahs are the fastest land animals on the planet ― possibly even the speediest to have ever lived. The Asiatic cheetah has been isolated from its African cousins for at least 32,000 years, according to National Geographic. Genetically distinct, the Asiatic cheetah also differs slightly from its African counterparts in appearance. They have shorter legs and smaller heads, and boast more powerful necks and thicker coats."

BBC Two announced on Monday that the network has commissioned a two-part documentary that will detail the multiple sexual misconduct allegations against the film producer and his inevitable fall from grace. “Weinstein” ― the working title of the film ― will be directed by Ursula MacFarlane (director of “Charlie Hebdo: 3 Days That Shook Paris”) and produced by two-time Academy Award winner Simon Chinn. “This film promises to be the definitive take on the Weinstein scandal,” BBC commissioner Tom McDonald said. “As well as revealing the inside story of the past few months in minute detail, it will also look to the past to tell the story of abuses of power within Hollywood since its very origins and chart the rise of Harvey Weinstein himself over many decades.”According to the network’s announcement, the film will include interviews with reporters, Hollywood insiders and the many actresses who came forward with stories about Weinstein. BBC Two controller Patrick Holland told BBC News that the recent reckoning of sexual misconduct in Hollywood will have far-reaching impacts, which is why they’re creating the documentary.“The breaking of silence over Harvey Weinstein is a watershed moment for the creative industries and for wider society,” he said. Since the publication of two revealing reports in The New York Times and The New Yorker this fall, Weinstein has been accused by more than 60 women of some form of sexual misconduct, ranging from harassment to assault and rape. The producer has denied all allegations against him.BBC has not set a release date for “Weinstein.” "

Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) apparently is over the multiple sexual misconduct allegations against President Donald Trump. Manchin appeared on CNN’s “New Day” on Monday morning to discuss the recent ethics investigation into the sexual misconduct allegations against Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.). During the conversation, Manchin also commented on the numerous accusations of sexual misconduct against Trump. When asked if he believes Trump should be investigated, Manchin said he’s “moved on.” “You know I’m not going to make that determination because he went through an election process with all of this in the open,” he told CNN. “If people feel that to be done, I think we have other things to be done too. I think women ought to have a right to come forward, they feel very strong about this. They should be protected, they can’t be retaliated on.”Trump has been publicly accused of sexual misconduct, ranging from harassment to assault and rape, by 21 women. Manchin is up for re-election next year in West Virginia, a predominantly Republican state. Alabama’s Democratic Sen.-elect Doug Jones shared a similar sentiment on Sunday, telling CNN that people “need to move on” from the allegations against Trump. “People had an opportunity to judge before that election,” Jones said. “I think we need to move on and not get distracted by those issues. I don’t think the president ought to resign at this point. We’ll see how things go.”Sens. Cory Booker (N.J.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.) are two of many Democratic lawmakers who have called on the president to resign over the sexual misconduct accusations. More than 100 Democrats in the U.S. House recently signed a letter urging Congress to open an investigation into the accusations. Last week, four of Trump’s accusers held a press conference to call on Congress to investigate their claims. Manchin told CNN that he believes there should be an ethics investigation into Franken’s alleged behavior but he does not believe the senator should follow through with his resignation. Franken announced Dec. 7 that he would step down from his Senate seat in “coming weeks.”“The political rancoring here is just unbelievable to me,” Manchin said. “How you can destroy a human being’s life and his family and everything that they stand for without giving them another chance? ... I definitely think he should not resign.”"

Another Instagram caption made it seem like Aguilera donned the outfit for a cowboy-themed birthday party. (Her big day is Dec. 18.) But it’s also possible the star just loves celebrating the holidays. Last year around the same time, she dressed up as the Grinch’s wife and as Santa: “Love dressing up for my favorite time of year! Happy holidays from Mr. & Mrs. Grinchmas!!” she wrote. Aguilera’s latest outfit is very on-trend, as the suit jacket-without-a-shirt look has been popular among celebrities for the past year. Demi Lovato rocked a similar look to Aguilera’s at the 2017 MTV Europe Music Awards in November. And Emily Ratajkowski and Kim Kardashian are fans of the style as well: "

While New York and other cities now have larger programs than Chicago, the way it is playing out in the Windy City shows both its promise and pitfalls.Participatory budgeting allows residents to vote on how their public funds will be spent, with the chance to submit and develop their own proposals. Some residents work directly with city staff to flesh out proposals and assign an accurate dollar amount to each, but anyone is welcome to propose a project and to vote, without any further time commitment.Participatory budgeting can be used to allocate a certain portion of a city’s total budget, or a specific pot of money. In Chicago, it is used primarily to decide how to spend a $1.3 million annual infrastructure fund that each ward’s alderman controls. This funding, called menu money, has long been used to repave streets, sidewalks and alleys, and fix lighting, but wards with participatory budgeting have also have voted to use the money for murals, playgrounds, drinking fountains, trees and fences.In Rogers Park, thanks to participatory budgeting, there is now a community garden, where locals come together to grow herbs and vegetables at a spot previously known for crime. Wellman said the garden is especially popular with Burmese refugees because it reminds them of farming at home.Another Rogers Park resident, Maria Hadden, got involved in participatory budgeting in 2009 because she was feeling disempowered and marginalized.“At a time of having a lack of clarity on pretty much everything especially related to government, it was super refreshing,” Hadden said of participatory budgeting. “It was democracy as growing up I had imagined and learned it to be. I wondered why we didn’t do this with everything.”Hadden was so enamored of the process that she went on to become Midwest and South senior project manager at the Participatory Budgeting Project, a national organization with offices in New York, Chicago and Oakland, California.The Participatory Budgeting Project partnered with the Great Cities Institute at the University of Illinois at Chicago and secured funding from foundations and other sources to form PB Chicago. Since its 2012 inception, PB Chicago has logged many successes, highlighted on an interactive map on its website. LaNaye Lawson received funding for murals documenting Reconstruction and the Great Migration in the museum in the South Side elementary school where she is a teacher. On the city’s Northwest Side, there were funds for a playground to be made accessible for kids with disabilities.And on the city’s far Southeast Side, where residents have fought environmental battles that include the storage of toxic petroleum coke, Bautista is hopeful that participatory budgeting can help boost public health, with air monitors, protected bike lanes and outdoor exercise equipment.A proposal to place exercise equipment along an existing bike trail was voted on in the last cycle, with results set to be announced soon.

And since it is the main funding source available for street repaving and lighting, residents can be forced to choose between necessary infrastructure and the projects they really want ― a challenge that particularly concerned Alderman Ricardo Munoz.“No matter how hard we tried to convince people that it was important to resurface alleys and roads, the money went to spray pools, basketball courts and additional lights for night basketball and baseball,” Munoz said during a discussion about PB on the TV station WTTW last spring.In each ward, the first step is for residents to vote what percentage of the money should go to repaving. After that, they vote on proposed projects they’d like to fund.In April, the city’s inspector general released an audit saying that menu money is vastly insufficient for infrastructure, and that the uniform distribution across wards shortchanges neighborhoods with infrastructure in bad condition. He called for centralizing repaving under the city Department of Transportation, a move that could jeopardize menu money for participatory budgeting. But there are many other ways participatory budgeting could play out. On Dec. 16, PB Chicago held a forum for Chicagoans to celebrate and strategize about the future of participatory budgeting.“Chicago could have a citywide process around school budgets, criminal justice reform, TIFs [tax increment financing],” said Hadden. “The sky’s the limit here when you think about PB as a tool helping solve a problem.”The biggest challenge may be that, as with any democratic process, success depends on widespread participation. But many Chicagoans struggling just to get by have little time or energy for extra projects, especially if they feel alienated and disillusioned by city government. This could be particularly true for underserved low-income people and people of color, who potentially have the most to gain through participatory budgeting, but see the process dominated by wealthier people with more time on their hands.“When you’re used to things being told to you and demanded of you, and you never have a voice, you can be a little leery,” said Lawson, noting that her neighbors are increasingly interested in participatory budgeting since learning about her murals. “It’s a process, it’s important we keep at it year after year, so it becomes a norm.”For more content and to be part of the ‘This New World’ community, join our Facebook Group.

22,ENTERTAINMENT,Rose McGowan Rips Meryl Streep For Black-Dress Protest At Golden Globes,Ron Dicker,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rose-mcgowan-meryl-streep-golden-globes_us_5a3791fce4b040881bec0a62,"She accused Streep of ""hypocrisy"" for her response to sex abuse allegations against Harvey Weinstein and Hollywood.",2017-12-18,Meryl Streep told an outlet she wouldn't talk about reports of a planned protest at the Golden Globes.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a3797341600004700c5081b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Rose McGowan slammed fellow actresses who reportedly plan to wear black to next month’s Golden Globes awards to protest sexual misconduct in Hollywood ― but she directed her venom at one in particular.McGowan, who said the producer Harvey Weinstein raped her, called out three-time Oscar winner Meryl Streep on Saturday for “hypocrisy.” “Actresses, like Meryl Streep, who happily worked for The Pig Monster, are wearing black @GoldenGlobes in a silent protest,” McGowan wrote in a tweet reported by several outlets. “YOUR SILENCE is THE problem. You’ll accept a fake award breathlessly and affect no real change. I despise your hypocrisy. Maybe you should all wear Marchesa.” (Marchesa is a brand co-founded by Weinstein’s now-estranged wife, Georgina Chapman.)People, citing “multiple sources,” reported last week that the silent sartorial demonstration at the Globes was on, involving presenters and nominees such as Jessica Chastain, Mary J. Blige and Streep.Streep had worked with Weinstein on films such as “August: Osage County,” and “The Iron Lady,” for which she won a best actress Oscar. She has called the Weinstein accusers who stepped forward “heroes.” She told HuffPost in October that Weinstein’s alleged predatory behavior was “disgraceful,” but insisted she did not know about it at the time.Streep this month condemned Weinstein’s behavior as a “gargantuan example of disrespect” ― a comment McGowan criticized.When asked by “Extra” about the award ceremony protest, Streep said she wasn’t talking. The Golden Globes take place on Jan. 7.Meanwhile, actress Amber Tamblyn criticized McGowan on Sunday for “shaming or taunting the movements of other women who are trying to create change.”HuffPost has reached out to a Streep rep for comment, but didn’t immediately hear back.This story has been updated to include tweets from Tamblyn."
23,POLITICS,Congress Delayed Key Safeguard That May Have Prevented Washington Train Derailment,Igor Bobic,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/washington-train-derailment_us_5a382ef7e4b0860bf4aa631b,The Amtrak train that crashed Monday was not using a new technology that can stop accidents before they occur.,2017-12-18,The scene where an Amtrak passenger train derailed on a bridge in Washington Monday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a383ae7150000490049c63e.jpeg?cache=DLYc1zsajF&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Congress delayed the implementation of an advanced safeguard that could help prevent railroad accidents like the one in Washington state Monday.At least three people were killed and dozens more were injured after an Amtrak passenger train heading from Seattle to Portland, Oregon, plunged off an interstate highway overpass, law enforcement officials said.Amtrak officials said a new safety mechanism called “positive train control” was not activated at the time of the derailment. The train was traveling on an inaugural run of a high-speed service route. The Amtrak Cascades 501 service was approved to reach speeds of up to 79 mph, but investigators late Monday said that that the train was traveling 80 mph in a 30 mph zone at the time of the incident. Officials said it was “too early” to tell why the train was going that fast. Positive train control is a system meant to automatically stop trains before certain accidents happen, like train-to-train collisions and derailments caused by excessive speed. After a 2008 crash in California, a new law required trains across the country to install the technology by the end of 2015, the Hill reported.But as the deadline approached, Congress extended it until the end of 2018, after receiving complaints from freight and commuter railroad companies about the difficulty of converting to the new system. The extension was part of a five-year highway bill compromise between the House and Senate that President Barack Obama signed into law.Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), who warned about delaying positive train control at the time, tweeted Monday that the technology “must be implemented immediately.”Other lawmakers said they’d like to see the results of the investigation before drawing conclusions.“We don’t know that it could have saved lives,” Rep. Denny Heck (D-Wash.), who represents the district where the Monday derailment occurred, told CNN of the technology after the crash. “But it was a disappointment that we’re not further along in implementation and installing PTC in trains throughout America.”“We can’t jump to conclusions,” Heck further warned.The National Transportation Safety Board is conducting an investigation into the accident, but it may take months before it is completed.The absence of positive train control was a contributing factor to a deadly passenger train derailment in Philadelphia in 2015, according to the safety board. In that incident, an Amtrak engineer became distracted and accelerated to more than twice the speed limit as he entered a curve.President Donald Trump initially addressed the deadly derailment on Twitter by making the case for an overhaul of the nation’s crumbling infrastructure system via a plan he is expected to soon unveil. The incident in Washington, however, occurred on a brand new service line."

The appalling lack of humanity and decency has not gone unnoticed,” Hockley wrote in a Facebook post that went viral. “While they ignorantly partied and remained uninformed on an issue that kills thousands of Americans every year, I was crying myself to sleep,” Hockley continued. “While they got the chance to kiss their children goodnight, I kissed the urn holding my beautiful boy’s ashes.” Hockley was one of two parents who founded Sandy Hook Promise, a nonprofit that focuses on protecting children from gun violence. In an interview with HuffPost, Hockley said Dylan was the glue that held her family together. “He had a huge smile and beautiful eyes, and everyone was so in love with him. He was an amazing little boy,” she said.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed to the New York Daily News that LaPierre was present at the White House Christmas party on the evening of Dec. 14.“I’m not aware of a conversation between [LaPierre and Trump],” Huckabee told the Daily News. “He was there for a Christmas party and not a formal meeting of any kind.”"
25,ENTERTAINMENT,Tommy Wiseau Is About To Star In Another Weird Movie.

It needed to be physical, a little violent even, or risk looking phony. But Wiseau wasn’t having it.“Tommy became really, really upset,” MacGregor told HuffPost by phone earlier this month. “He just went on a tirade about, ‘Don’t you know anything about real acting? You never touch an actor like that.’” That’s right: Wiseau, a cult figure known for writing, directing, financing and co-starring in the proverbial worst movie ever made, insisted he was the one who knew a thing or two about “real acting.” MacGregor, worried he wouldn’t be able to get the necessary shot, humored him. “You’re right, you’re right,” the 25-year-old director said. They rehearsed a gentler version of the same altercation. It “looked like shit,” so, unbeknownst to Wiseau, MacGregor told the actor portraying the clown to strangle him with the same ferocity originally planned. “And Tommy blew up,” MacGregor recalled. “We have behind-the-scenes footage of it, too. He rained down on the clown-man actor, not on me, because as far as Tommy was concerned, I had given the direction to do it softly, and the clown man ignored me. Basically, we got the shot, it’s amazing, and it plays so well in the film. I threw the clown under the bus that day, but I would do it again. That happened a few times, where I had to be sneaky and creative to get something out of Tommy that he wasn’t going to do.”Such is the agony and ecstasy of working with Tommy Wiseau, the enigmatic multi-hyphenate whose profile is again rising thanks to this month’s release of “The Disaster Artist,” a comedic biopic directed by and starring James Franco, who plays Wiseau immediately before and during the making of “The Room.”Wiseau has become one of Hollywood’s most mythologized oddballs. He refuses to disclose his age or the exact origins of his vaguely Eastern European accent. He also won’t say how he became wealthy enough to pony up $6 million to make “The Room,” his misguided passion project, released in theaters for an Oscar-qualifying two weeks in 2003. (Wiseau has offered select tidbits over the years, claiming his funds stem from real-estate deals and leather-jacket imports from Korea. Now, he runs Street Fashions USA, a site that sells “The Room” memorabilia and underwear with Wiseau’s name on the waistband.) For the past decade, the likeliest place to find Wiseau has been at one of the many midnight screenings of his notorious film ― an interactive experience that rivals “The Rocky Horror Picture Show.” In 2018, you’ll also be able to see him in “Best F(r)iends,” conceptualized and written by Sestero. Sestero told HuffPost he’d been brainstorming ideas for television series and movies when he saw a rough cut of “The Disaster Artist” about a year and a half ago. Even though Sestero had co-written the book on which the film is based, Franco’s performance painted his old friend in a new light: Wiseau “just wanted to be taken seriously,” Sestero realized. The two were on “OK terms” at the time, so Sestero started pondering what it would take to write Wiseau a part that fit him ― something far removed from “The Room,” in which Wiseau is unbelievable as an everyday, all-American type. Sestero then received a text from Wiseau, unprompted: “Maybe you should take a risk.” It was a sign. Sestero quickly developed a concept specifically for his friend, an “LA noir” in the vein of “Nightcrawler,” “Drive,” “Double Indemnity” and Michael Mann’s work.“We rehearsed scenes every night,” Sestero said. “I know how to write Tommy at this point. I can pretty much think like him. [...] Obviously when you have a friendship like ours, there’s going to be a lot of real-life material that bleeds into the story.” Soon thereafter, a mutual friend in the industry introduced Sestero to MacGregor, who’d first seen “The Room” in 10th grade and would go on study its awfulness via YouTube clips. Sestero and MacGregor bonded over cinematic favorites, and Sestero liked MacGregor’s demo reel. He hired the young filmmaker as the cinematographer on a concept trailer that would ideally become a “stepping stone” to making a feature-length project. MacGregor met Wiseau the day he arrived for their five-day trailer shoot in Los Angeles. He spotted the long, jet-black hair in a parking lot across from a 7-Eleven, where Wiseau stopped to buy Red Bull because “the man drinks an inhuman amount of Red Bull.” Wiseau was wearing his signature multiple belts. (You can see evidence of the hair, the belts and the Red Bull consumption in “The Disaster Artist.”)“You’re almost nervous about what he’s going to do,” MacGregor said. “There’s a tension in the air around that guy.” (Wiseau did not respond to a request for comment sent to the email address for “The Room.”)And yet, once filming began, MacGregor was struck by Wiseau’s sense of professionalism. Just as he’d intended with “The Room,” Wiseau wanted to make a quality product. He listened to direction and asked to watch playback to be sure scenes came out OK. “I don’t know how much he understood it, but he would pretend to,” MacGregor said of the notes he gave to Wiseau throughout the shoot. “He would try to interpret it, and there was kind of a sweetness to his personality, as well.”Wiseau and Sestero showed the trailer for “Best F(r)iends” at screenings of “The Room.” When they decided to move forward with the feature, Sestero asked MacGregor to direct. The shoestring budget, according to MacGregor, “rivaled” that of “The Blair Witch Project,” which was made for a reported $60,000 in 1999. (Sestero wouldn’t confirm or deny the costs, as he is currently negotiating theatrical distribution deals.)From there, a beautiful marriage was born. Sestero and Wiseau inducted MacGregor into their strange little world. In small spurts across 2017, they made two volumes of a bizarre “fable” about a lonely mortician who might be a vampire (Wiseau) and a drifter with a mysterious past who lives under a bridge (Sestero). The mortician gives the drifter a job, which provokes a series of misadventures in underground LA.“The reason that Tommy works in ‘Best F(r)iends’ is he’s not trying to be somebody he’s not,” MacGregor said. “He’s not trying to extend himself to be the guy in ‘The Room.’ Rather than do that, [Sestero wrote] something in Tommy’s cadence already. It’s written in his likeness. He has all the virtues of a hero, presented totally in a different way.”The title of the new film evokes “My Best Fiend,” the documentary Werner Herzog made about his turbulent relationship with actor Klaus Kinski, who starred in five of Herzog’s movies, including “Aguirre, the Wrath of God” and “Fitzcarraldo.” MacGregor always imagined that Wiseau and Sestero’s kinship was similar to that of Herzog and Kinski. “Everything that happens is something that actually happened between Greg and Tommy in real life,” he said. “An example of that is, in the movie, when the friendship goes sour, they confront each other on the edge of this cliff. You get the feeling one of them is going to go over the cliff once this argument has transpired.”To wit, Sestero said Wiseau once suspected that Sestero was going to kill him during a 2003 road trip from Los Angeles to San Francisco. He’d asked Wiseau to meet him out back after he checked into their motel, and Wiseau apparently thought that meant his life was in danger. Wiseau casually mentioned his hunch while falling asleep that night, as if it were just another bump in the road. During the same trip, Sestero imagined how Wiseau would manage if Sestero abandoned him in the cliffs of Bodega Bay. Little moments like these made their way into the movie. Meanwhile, other events in “Best F(r)iends” are ripped from seedy headlines.“They sell gold teeth on the black market, which is also a true story,” MacGregor said. “People think, ‘Oh, that’s really unrealistic, who came up with that? I don’t see it being plausible.’ But I assure you it really happened. Greg’s brother is a dentist, actually, so a lot of this comes close to home.”Throughout the shoot, which spanned about 28 days across 2017, MacGregor found that Wiseau lived up to the try-hard image presented in “The Disaster Artist.” He didn’t always have the vocabulary to express himself eloquently, but underneath the ego and the oddities was a real person who, over Chinese food at 2 a.m. after a long day of work, would tell “personal stories” about his business dealings and his time growing up in New Orleans, though never anything especially deep or mystery-shattering.As for the incident with the evil clown, well, that, too, became fodder for the production. When MacGregor needed Wiseau to laugh on-camera, he would say “clown man,” and Wiseau would lose himself in a fit of giggles.Sestero and MacGregor showed a work-in-progress cut of “Best F(r)iends: Volume 1” to test audiences in the U.K. and LA. A handful of folks who presumably caught one of those screenings have reviewed the film on Letterboxd, a social media platform where users rate, review and discuss movies. Their responses range from euphoric (“It’s the hardest I’ve laughed in a very long time on the sheer principle of insanity”) to baffled (“I’m not quite sure what I just watched”). Some note that it’s surprising to see Wiseau appear in something he didn’t write and direct himself ― a notion MacGregor knew he would encounter upon taking the job.For better or worse, “The Disaster Artist” could heighten this movie’s following. MacGregor and Sestero said the first volume will “definitely” open theatrically in 2018, possibly as early as March. Separately, they declined to elaborate, but MacGregor said distribution prospects and festival bookings “are presenting themselves, seemingly on a daily basis.” Whether that puts more pressure on the film to reach an audience beyond “The Room” diehards makes MacGregor a bit nervous, as it’s “meant for the fans.” But if it contributes anything to the overall “mythos and lore” of Wiseau, he’s thrilled to be part of that. “We did the opposite of what Tommy did with ‘The Room,’” MacGregor said. “He had all that money, and then ― God bless that movie, we all love it — he made something godawful. We’ve done quite the opposite. We had nothing, and with good story and good filmmaking and good creative minds coming together, we’ve done something we’re proud of.”"

It needed to be physical, a little violent even, or risk looking phony. But Wiseau wasn’t having it.“Tommy became really, really upset,” MacGregor told HuffPost by phone earlier this month. “He just went on a tirade about, ‘Don’t you know anything about real acting? You never touch an actor like that.’” That’s right: Wiseau, a cult figure known for writing, directing, financing and co-starring in the proverbial worst movie ever made, insisted he was the one who knew a thing or two about “real acting.” MacGregor, worried he wouldn’t be able to get the necessary shot, humored him. “You’re right, you’re right,” the 25-year-old director said. They rehearsed a gentler version of the same altercation. It “looked like shit,” so, unbeknownst to Wiseau, MacGregor told the actor portraying the clown to strangle him with the same ferocity originally planned. “And Tommy blew up,” MacGregor recalled. “We have behind-the-scenes footage of it, too. He rained down on the clown-man actor, not on me, because as far as Tommy was concerned, I had given the direction to do it softly, and the clown man ignored me. Basically, we got the shot, it’s amazing, and it plays so well in the film. I threw the clown under the bus that day, but I would do it again. That happened a few times, where I had to be sneaky and creative to get something out of Tommy that he wasn’t going to do.”Such is the agony and ecstasy of working with Tommy Wiseau, the enigmatic multi-hyphenate whose profile is again rising thanks to this month’s release of “The Disaster Artist,” a comedic biopic directed by and starring James Franco, who plays Wiseau immediately before and during the making of “The Room.”Wiseau has become one of Hollywood’s most mythologized oddballs. He refuses to disclose his age or the exact origins of his vaguely Eastern European accent. He also won’t say how he became wealthy enough to pony up $6 million to make “The Room,” his misguided passion project, released in theaters for an Oscar-qualifying two weeks in 2003. (Wiseau has offered select tidbits over the years, claiming his funds stem from real-estate deals and leather-jacket imports from Korea. Now, he runs Street Fashions USA, a site that sells “The Room” memorabilia and underwear with Wiseau’s name on the waistband.) For the past decade, the likeliest place to find Wiseau has been at one of the many midnight screenings of his notorious film ― an interactive experience that rivals “The Rocky Horror Picture Show.” In 2018, you’ll also be able to see him in “Best F(r)iends,” conceptualized and written by Sestero. Sestero told HuffPost he’d been brainstorming ideas for television series and movies when he saw a rough cut of “The Disaster Artist” about a year and a half ago. Even though Sestero had co-written the book on which the film is based, Franco’s performance painted his old friend in a new light: Wiseau “just wanted to be taken seriously,” Sestero realized. The two were on “OK terms” at the time, so Sestero started pondering what it would take to write Wiseau a part that fit him ― something far removed from “The Room,” in which Wiseau is unbelievable as an everyday, all-American type. Sestero then received a text from Wiseau, unprompted: “Maybe you should take a risk.” It was a sign. Sestero quickly developed a concept specifically for his friend, an “LA noir” in the vein of “Nightcrawler,” “Drive,” “Double Indemnity” and Michael Mann’s work.“We rehearsed scenes every night,” Sestero said. “I know how to write Tommy at this point. I can pretty much think like him. [...] Obviously when you have a friendship like ours, there’s going to be a lot of real-life material that bleeds into the story.” Soon thereafter, a mutual friend in the industry introduced Sestero to MacGregor, who’d first seen “The Room” in 10th grade and would go on study its awfulness via YouTube clips. Sestero and MacGregor bonded over cinematic favorites, and Sestero liked MacGregor’s demo reel. He hired the young filmmaker as the cinematographer on a concept trailer that would ideally become a “stepping stone” to making a feature-length project. MacGregor met Wiseau the day he arrived for their five-day trailer shoot in Los Angeles. He spotted the long, jet-black hair in a parking lot across from a 7-Eleven, where Wiseau stopped to buy Red Bull because “the man drinks an inhuman amount of Red Bull.” Wiseau was wearing his signature multiple belts. (You can see evidence of the hair, the belts and the Red Bull consumption in “The Disaster Artist.”)“You’re almost nervous about what he’s going to do,” MacGregor said. “There’s a tension in the air around that guy.” (Wiseau did not respond to a request for comment sent to the email address for “The Room.”)And yet, once filming began, MacGregor was struck by Wiseau’s sense of professionalism. Just as he’d intended with “The Room,” Wiseau wanted to make a quality product. He listened to direction and asked to watch playback to be sure scenes came out OK. “I don’t know how much he understood it, but he would pretend to,” MacGregor said of the notes he gave to Wiseau throughout the shoot. “He would try to interpret it, and there was kind of a sweetness to his personality, as well.”Wiseau and Sestero showed the trailer for “Best F(r)iends” at screenings of “The Room.” When they decided to move forward with the feature, Sestero asked MacGregor to direct. The shoestring budget, according to MacGregor, “rivaled” that of “The Blair Witch Project,” which was made for a reported $60,000 in 1999. (Sestero wouldn’t confirm or deny the costs, as he is currently negotiating theatrical distribution deals.)From there, a beautiful marriage was born. Sestero and Wiseau inducted MacGregor into their strange little world. In small spurts across 2017, they made two volumes of a bizarre “fable” about a lonely mortician who might be a vampire (Wiseau) and a drifter with a mysterious past who lives under a bridge (Sestero). The mortician gives the drifter a job, which provokes a series of misadventures in underground LA.“The reason that Tommy works in ‘Best F(r)iends’ is he’s not trying to be somebody he’s not,” MacGregor said. “He’s not trying to extend himself to be the guy in ‘The Room.’ Rather than do that, [Sestero wrote] something in Tommy’s cadence already. It’s written in his likeness. He has all the virtues of a hero, presented totally in a different way.”The title of the new film evokes “My Best Fiend,” the documentary Werner Herzog made about his turbulent relationship with actor Klaus Kinski, who starred in five of Herzog’s movies, including “Aguirre, the Wrath of God” and “Fitzcarraldo.” MacGregor always imagined that Wiseau and Sestero’s kinship was similar to that of Herzog and Kinski. “Everything that happens is something that actually happened between Greg and Tommy in real life,” he said. “An example of that is, in the movie, when the friendship goes sour, they confront each other on the edge of this cliff. You get the feeling one of them is going to go over the cliff once this argument has transpired.”To wit, Sestero said Wiseau once suspected that Sestero was going to kill him during a 2003 road trip from Los Angeles to San Francisco. He’d asked Wiseau to meet him out back after he checked into their motel, and Wiseau apparently thought that meant his life was in danger. Wiseau casually mentioned his hunch while falling asleep that night, as if it were just another bump in the road. During the same trip, Sestero imagined how Wiseau would manage if Sestero abandoned him in the cliffs of Bodega Bay. Little moments like these made their way into the movie. Meanwhile, other events in “Best F(r)iends” are ripped from seedy headlines.“They sell gold teeth on the black market, which is also a true story,” MacGregor said. “People think, ‘Oh, that’s really unrealistic, who came up with that? I don’t see it being plausible.’ But I assure you it really happened. Greg’s brother is a dentist, actually, so a lot of this comes close to home.”Throughout the shoot, which spanned about 28 days across 2017, MacGregor found that Wiseau lived up to the try-hard image presented in “The Disaster Artist.” He didn’t always have the vocabulary to express himself eloquently, but underneath the ego and the oddities was a real person who, over Chinese food at 2 a.m. after a long day of work, would tell “personal stories” about his business dealings and his time growing up in New Orleans, though never anything especially deep or mystery-shattering.As for the incident with the evil clown, well, that, too, became fodder for the production. When MacGregor needed Wiseau to laugh on-camera, he would say “clown man,” and Wiseau would lose himself in a fit of giggles.Sestero and MacGregor showed a work-in-progress cut of “Best F(r)iends: Volume 1” to test audiences in the U.K. and LA. A handful of folks who presumably caught one of those screenings have reviewed the film on Letterboxd, a social media platform where users rate, review and discuss movies. Their responses range from euphoric (“It’s the hardest I’ve laughed in a very long time on the sheer principle of insanity”) to baffled (“I’m not quite sure what I just watched”). Some note that it’s surprising to see Wiseau appear in something he didn’t write and direct himself ― a notion MacGregor knew he would encounter upon taking the job.For better or worse, “The Disaster Artist” could heighten this movie’s following. MacGregor and Sestero said the first volume will “definitely” open theatrically in 2018, possibly as early as March. Separately, they declined to elaborate, but MacGregor said distribution prospects and festival bookings “are presenting themselves, seemingly on a daily basis.” Whether that puts more pressure on the film to reach an audience beyond “The Room” diehards makes MacGregor a bit nervous, as it’s “meant for the fans.” But if it contributes anything to the overall “mythos and lore” of Wiseau, he’s thrilled to be part of that. “We did the opposite of what Tommy did with ‘The Room,’” MacGregor said. “He had all that money, and then ― God bless that movie, we all love it — he made something godawful. We’ve done quite the opposite. We had nothing, and with good story and good filmmaking and good creative minds coming together, we’ve done something we’re proud of.”"

He came to the attention of authorities earlier this year, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) said.“This man was a loyal agent of North Korea, who believed he was acting to serve some higher patriotic purpose,” AFP Assistant Commissioner Neil Gaughan told reporters.“This case is like nothing we have ever seen on Australian soil,” he said.Police will allege the man tried to broker the sale of missile components, including software for the guidance systems of ballistic missiles, as well as trying to sell coal to third parties in Indonesia and Vietnam.Gaughan said the trade could have been worth “tens of millions of dollars” if successful.Cash-strapped North Korea has come under a new round of stricter United Nations sanctions this year after pressing ahead with its missile and nuclear programmes in defiance of international pressure.Tensions have risen dramatically on the Korean peninsula because of the North’s ballistic missile launches and its sixth and most powerful nuclear test, as well as joint military drills between South Korea and the United States that the North describes as preparation for war.Pyongyang claimed that its latest intercontinental ballistic missile launch in November had the range to reach all of the United States.U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson urged North Korea on Friday to carry out a “sustained cessation” of its weapons testing to allow talks about its missile and nuclear programmes.However, the North has shown little interest in talks until it has the ability to hit the U.S. mainland with a nuclear-tipped missile, which many experts say it has yet to prove.Gaughan said the man had been in touch with high-ranking North Korean officials but no missile components ever made it to Australia. He also said there was no indication officials in Indonesia or Vietnam had been involved in the attempted coal sales.“This is black market 101,” Gaughan said.“We are alleging that all the activity occurred offshore, and was purely another attempt for this man to trade goods and services as a way to raise revenue for the government of North Korea,” he said.The man faces up to 18 years in jail if convicted. He did not apply for bail and will next face court on Wednesday."

The designer, who co-founded the Dolce & Gabbana luxury fashion house with Domenico Dolce, told Italy’s Corriere della Sera daily, “I don’t want to be called gay, because I’m simply a man … full stop.” “The word ‘gay’ was invented by those who need to label people,” he said in the interview, the AFP reported Sunday. “I don’t want to be identified by my sexual choices.” Still, the 55-year-old spoke at length about his sexuality in the interview, saying he began to acknowledge his same-sex attraction at age 18 when he and a former girlfriend went dancing and he “was watching the men more than her.”“I had known for a while, but I didn’t have the courage to admit it. Only through therapy did I realize that there had been clear signs in my childhood,” he said, according to AFP. “I wanted to play alone … because I felt different from the other children and I feared that if we were together they would realize. And they would tell my mother,” he said.Gabbana’s comments echoed those he offered on Instagram in January. Given President Donald Trump’s anti-LGBTQ platform, Dolce & Gabbana have been criticized for their willingness to dress first lady Melania Trump. In an Instagram post praising Melania as a #DGWoman, Gabbana said, “Dont call me gay please!! Im a man!!! Who I love its my private life!!!” (sic). Dolce & Gabbana’s stance on LGBTQ issues has raised eyebrows in the past. In 2015, the designers faced a backlash after they made some contentious remarks about same-sex families in an interview with Italian magazine Panorama. Children born through in vitro fertilization, the men said, are “children of chemistry, synthetic children. Uteruses for rent, semen chosen from a catalog.”After Elton John, Ricky Martin and other celebrities blasted their remarks, Dolce and Gabbana backtracked. “We firmly believe in democracy and the fundamental principle of freedom of expression that upholds it,” Gabbana said at the time. “We talked about our way of seeing reality, but it was never our intention to judge other people’s choices. We do believe in freedom and love.”"

There’s one big problem, though: Even though Republican leaders like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) say they want to help these immigrants, known as Dreamers, they say they don’t want to attach a fix to the spending bill. They’ll take care of the problem later ― they promise.But when it comes to immigration reform in Congress, “later” often means “never,” immigration advocates say. They would know: This has all happened before.For Dreamers, their allies say, it’s now ― or, most likely, never.“From our point of view,” said Frank Sharry, president of the pro-reform group America’s Voice and a longtime immigration advocate, “it’s the 22nd or bust.”Dreamers wouldn’t be in this pickle without President Donald Trump, who rescinded the DACA program in September, a move that could eventually put nearly 700,000 young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children at risk of deportation. Dreamers are already feeling the effects of Trump’s decision to rescind DACA: Since the September announcement, an estimated 11,000 young people have lost their deportation protections. Without legislative action before March 5, the number of people losing protections is expected to go up to nearly 1,000 a day.Immigration reform activists believe the massive year-end bill on government spending is the best bet for getting help for DACA recipients, because Republicans will need Democratic votes to get a deal through. “Delay means deportation,” warned Cristina Jiménez, executive director of the Dreamer advocacy group United We Dream. McConnell and Ryan, however, say they want to pass separate legislation to grant legal status to undocumented young people and ramp up border security and other enforcement, most likely next year.Immigration advocates see the writing on the wall. Even though there’s support from voters, the White House and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to help Dreamers, and a clear March “deadline” to act, they fear a standalone bill could fall victim to the same things that brought down comprehensive immigration reform efforts four years ago ― a House speaker held hostage by hard-liners in the Republican Party, and a president and GOP members who want drastic immigration measures in return for a deal. Here’s what happened last time. In 2013, the Senate passed a comprehensive immigration reform bill that included border security, legal status for more undocumented immigrants, and changes to the legal immigration system and the Dream Act ― legislation that would grant a years-long path to citizenship for certain young people who came to the U.S. as children. To the chagrin of Democrats, reform supporters and the Obama White House, then-House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) refused to put the Senate bill up for a vote. “We knew we had 218. We’d counted them,” recounted former top Obama official Cecilia Muñoz, referring to the number of votes needed to get a bill through the House. But immigration hard-liners railed about how any legal status for undocumented immigrants would amount to “amnesty,” even if it came with a massive increase in border security, changes to legal immigration and other enforcement. Boehner refused to push through the Senate bill with mostly Democratic and just a handful of Republican votes. Instead, he decided the House was going to write its own legislation, a bill drafted through “regular order” that would reflect “the will of our majority.” Critics failed to recognize that ”there is no magic button on the Speaker’s desk to bring legislation to the floor,” said Michael Steel, a former Boehner aide who worked in his office at the time. “Given the strong opposition of immigration reform opponents, and their concern that Democrats could ‘team up’ with Republicans who favored comprehensive immigration reform to pass a bill on the floor that the majority of the Republican conference strongly opposed, it was simply never practically possible to go down that path,” Steel said. The House’s effort to write its own comprehensive immigration bill failed. Democrats and the White House blamed Republican lawmakers for opposing a workable agreement on immigration reform, while Boehner faults former President Barack Obama for the failure. A narrow effort to help Dreamers, spearheaded by then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.), fell apart as well. “It’s a political problem, and it’s a political problem with anything in the immigration family,” Muñoz told HuffPost. Some of the dynamics that killed immigration reform before haven’t changed.Four years after the failure of comprehensive immigration reform, Ryan may have put himself in the same situation as Boehner did.When he became speaker, Ryan vowed he, too, would not bring an immigration bill to a vote without support from the majority of his conference — and reform advocates don’t think he could get it without making concessions to hard-liners on enforcement that Democrats wouldn’t support.In addition, Ryan, like Boehner, has repeatedly expressed his preference for passing legislation through “regular order,” which would entail going through committees rather than being attached to big legislation like the spending bill. But the powerful Judiciary Committee, which handles most immigration issues, is still led by Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), who during the last reform push focused on enforcement bills, not any that would have granted legal status to undocumented immigrants.It’s an open question whether Ryan will hold firm on the process and only act if a majority of his caucus lends its support.Ryan reiterated this week that help for DACA recipients is not on the table as part of the spending bill deal. “DACA is separate,” he said at a press conference on Tuesday. But Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong didn’t entirely rule out the possibility. “Discussions amongst Republican members and the Trump administration continue,” she said later the same day. “No decisions have been made.”The other variable here is what, exactly, the future holds for Ryan. Rumors are swirling on Capitol Hill that he may step down as speaker next year, which could make it easier for him to make a deal that some members in his conference, including the conservative Freedom Caucus, would oppose. Ryan denied on Thursday that he plans to quit in the near future. Just like four years ago, many GOP lawmakers will only vote for Dreamer protections if they are accompanied by hard-line immigration enforcement measures. But that would imperil the bill’s chances with Democrats, making it unlikely it would ever pass the Senate. While Democrats have said they could support additional border security measures, they could never stomach the full GOP wish list, which includes a border wall, restricting legal immigration, punishing jurisdictions that don’t help deportation efforts and ramping up other enforcement measures. Dreamer advocates have said they don’t want their protections to come at the expense of their families and the rest of the undocumented community through hard-line enforcement measures.“I think that there are Republicans that earnestly want to get this done and think that there’s a path forward to a standalone bill, but the math just doesn’t work,” said Tyler Moran, managing director of DC Immigration Hub, who worked on immigration issues in the White House and for former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.). “In order to get votes from the Freedom Caucus, the bill will turn into something that the Senate can’t support.”Trump is one big question mark.Trump expressed sympathy for Dreamers during the campaign and in his first year in office, but so far, he has spent more time calling on Congress to fund a border wall with Mexico and echoing hard-liners’ immigration demands than asking lawmakers to find a solution for Dreamers.Trump has characterized Democratic efforts to put Dreamer protections in a spending deal as “want[ing] to have illegal immigrants pouring into our country, [and] bring with them crime, tremendous amounts of drugs.” Any deal on DACA must include “Border Security with a wall; restore interior enforcement and stop visa overstays; and it must end chain migration,” White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said in a statement, referring to the process by which U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents can sponsor their parents, adult children and siblings to immigrate to the U.S. Yet if Trump meant what he said earlier this year, and really has “a great heart” for young undocumented immigrants who didn’t come to the U.S. of their own volition, he could play a powerful role in rallying the Republican base.“There are things that are possible with this president that were not possible in the past,” Steel, the former Boehner aide, said. “The question is whether he has the will and the desire to do that.”Dreamers think this is their moment.Immigration reform advocates do have some reasons to hope this time will be different.Dreamers have dramatically improved their visibility since the Dream Act last failed in the Senate in 2010, and now have backing from major companies, faith leaders, labor groups, universities and more. A Fox News poll in September found that 83 percent of Americans believe Dreamers should be able to gain legal status, including 63 percent of Trump voters. Not all Democrats have vowed to vote against government funding without Dreamer protections, but there is near unanimous support in the party for the Dream Act. On the GOP side, 34 House Republicans have called for Ryan to bring up a bill by the end of the year, and one, Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.), even said he wouldn’t vote for government funding without Dreamer protections. There’s one more crucial difference the current Dreamer legislation has over the 2013 comprehensive immigration reform bill, and it’s one that might put particular pressure on a president in a constant search for positive headlines: There’s going to be a clear effect if this effort fails.DACA was still in effect when the 2013 process collapsed. But this time around, failure would put hundreds of thousands of young people who grew up in the U.S. at risk of soon being forced out. Will it be enough to force Republicans to act? CORRECTION: A previous version of this story mistakenly indicated U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents could sponsor their grandparents for greencards."
33,POLITICS,"If Congress Doesn't Act Soon To Save Dreamers, It Might Not Save Them At All",Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/government-shutdown-dreamers_us_5a2989ece4b0b185e53a3098,Immigration reform advocates want legal status for undocumented young people as part of a government spending bill.,2017-12-17,No one is sure what President Donald Trump would support.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a34386a1500001f0049bf54.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Unless Congress acts, nearly 700,000 undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children, and were granted work permits and protections under the Obama administration’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, will soon lose their jobs and be at risk of deportation.Immigration activists want Congress to attach a measure helping DACA recipients stay in the country to a government spending bill that must pass by Dec. 22. There’s one big problem, though: Even though Republican leaders like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) say they want to help these immigrants, known as Dreamers, they say they don’t want to attach a fix to the spending bill. They’ll take care of the problem later ― they promise.But when it comes to immigration reform in Congress, “later” often means “never,” immigration advocates say. They would know: This has all happened before.For Dreamers, their allies say, it’s now ― or, most likely, never.“From our point of view,” said Frank Sharry, president of the pro-reform group America’s Voice and a longtime immigration advocate, “it’s the 22nd or bust.”Dreamers wouldn’t be in this pickle without President Donald Trump, who rescinded the DACA program in September, a move that could eventually put nearly 700,000 young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children at risk of deportation. Dreamers are already feeling the effects of Trump’s decision to rescind DACA: Since the September announcement, an estimated 11,000 young people have lost their deportation protections. Without legislative action before March 5, the number of people losing protections is expected to go up to nearly 1,000 a day.Immigration reform activists believe the massive year-end bill on government spending is the best bet for getting help for DACA recipients, because Republicans will need Democratic votes to get a deal through. “Delay means deportation,” warned Cristina Jiménez, executive director of the Dreamer advocacy group United We Dream. McConnell and Ryan, however, say they want to pass separate legislation to grant legal status to undocumented young people and ramp up border security and other enforcement, most likely next year.Immigration advocates see the writing on the wall. Even though there’s support from voters, the White House and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to help Dreamers, and a clear March “deadline” to act, they fear a standalone bill could fall victim to the same things that brought down comprehensive immigration reform efforts four years ago ― a House speaker held hostage by hard-liners in the Republican Party, and a president and GOP members who want drastic immigration measures in return for a deal. Here’s what happened last time. In 2013, the Senate passed a comprehensive immigration reform bill that included border security, legal status for more undocumented immigrants, and changes to the legal immigration system and the Dream Act ― legislation that would grant a years-long path to citizenship for certain young people who came to the U.S. as children. To the chagrin of Democrats, reform supporters and the Obama White House, then-House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) refused to put the Senate bill up for a vote. “We knew we had 218. We’d counted them,” recounted former top Obama official Cecilia Muñoz, referring to the number of votes needed to get a bill through the House. But immigration hard-liners railed about how any legal status for undocumented immigrants would amount to “amnesty,” even if it came with a massive increase in border security, changes to legal immigration and other enforcement. Boehner refused to push through the Senate bill with mostly Democratic and just a handful of Republican votes. Instead, he decided the House was going to write its own legislation, a bill drafted through “regular order” that would reflect “the will of our majority.” Critics failed to recognize that ”there is no magic button on the Speaker’s desk to bring legislation to the floor,” said Michael Steel, a former Boehner aide who worked in his office at the time. “Given the strong opposition of immigration reform opponents, and their concern that Democrats could ‘team up’ with Republicans who favored comprehensive immigration reform to pass a bill on the floor that the majority of the Republican conference strongly opposed, it was simply never practically possible to go down that path,” Steel said. The House’s effort to write its own comprehensive immigration bill failed. Democrats and the White House blamed Republican lawmakers for opposing a workable agreement on immigration reform, while Boehner faults former President Barack Obama for the failure. A narrow effort to help Dreamers, spearheaded by then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.), fell apart as well. “It’s a political problem, and it’s a political problem with anything in the immigration family,” Muñoz told HuffPost. Some of the dynamics that killed immigration reform before haven’t changed.Four years after the failure of comprehensive immigration reform, Ryan may have put himself in the same situation as Boehner did.When he became speaker, Ryan vowed he, too, would not bring an immigration bill to a vote without support from the majority of his conference — and reform advocates don’t think he could get it without making concessions to hard-liners on enforcement that Democrats wouldn’t support.In addition, Ryan, like Boehner, has repeatedly expressed his preference for passing legislation through “regular order,” which would entail going through committees rather than being attached to big legislation like the spending bill. But the powerful Judiciary Committee, which handles most immigration issues, is still led by Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), who during the last reform push focused on enforcement bills, not any that would have granted legal status to undocumented immigrants.It’s an open question whether Ryan will hold firm on the process and only act if a majority of his caucus lends its support.Ryan reiterated this week that help for DACA recipients is not on the table as part of the spending bill deal. “DACA is separate,” he said at a press conference on Tuesday. But Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong didn’t entirely rule out the possibility. “Discussions amongst Republican members and the Trump administration continue,” she said later the same day. “No decisions have been made.”The other variable here is what, exactly, the future holds for Ryan. Rumors are swirling on Capitol Hill that he may step down as speaker next year, which could make it easier for him to make a deal that some members in his conference, including the conservative Freedom Caucus, would oppose. Ryan denied on Thursday that he plans to quit in the near future. Just like four years ago, many GOP lawmakers will only vote for Dreamer protections if they are accompanied by hard-line immigration enforcement measures. But that would imperil the bill’s chances with Democrats, making it unlikely it would ever pass the Senate. While Democrats have said they could support additional border security measures, they could never stomach the full GOP wish list, which includes a border wall, restricting legal immigration, punishing jurisdictions that don’t help deportation efforts and ramping up other enforcement measures.

34,ENTERTAINMENT,These Are The Real People Who Follow The Jedi Religion,Andy McDonald,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/american-jedi-documentary_us_5a355dfae4b01d429cc943c2,"""American Jedi"" documents a universal path of pain, growth and redemption.",2017-12-17,Laurent Malaquais (middle) stands with the cast of American Jedi.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a35942e1600002100c505c5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"“Star Wars: The Last Jedi” arrived in theaters Friday, and for most moviegoers, that galaxy far, far away fades from our imaginations once the film itself fades out. We chuck our popcorn tub into the garbage (hopefully), walk out of the cineplex and return to our blasterless, Yodaless, Millennium Falconless world.For small sects of the fanbase, however, the line between the two worlds has blurred, and their love for “Star Wars” has manifested itself into a religious devotion. Literally. A new film called “American Jedi” is an enchanting look at this community.In 2012, filmmaker Laurent Malaquais directed “Bronies,” a look at the obsessively devoted adult fans of the TV series “My Little Pony.” The documentary streamed on Netflix and was a critical success.Fascinated by the phenomenon of extreme fandom, Malaquais came across groups of “Star Wars” fans determined to become real life Jedi, representatives of the “light side” and the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy.More than just your average “Star Wars” fans, this is a community that has adopted Jediism into their daily lives through the Jedi code.The Jedi CodeMalaquais, like countless children, grew up loving the “Star Wars” universe. “The cinema was always a sacred space for me and Star Wars kept bringing me back there,” he told HuffPost.But unlike many, Malaquais’ unique upbringing ― his parents were hippies from Northern California ― taught him to keep an open mind about all religions.“I grew up in an environment where spirituality was about being inclusive of many religious practices,” he says. “I connected with the idea of being a Jedi, which is half warrior and half enlightened seeker of spiritual truth.”“American Jedi” follows one particular follower of Jediism, Opie Macleod, a legend in the community. His story mirrors the path of many Star Wars characters: pain, growth, redemption.While practicing within the Jedi community, Macleod discovered his then-wife was having an affair with his friend Miles Robinson. This was a lightsaber to the gut on multiple levels. In the Jedi community, Macleod’s wife was considered to be his Jedi student, whom he was training to live an honorable and peaceful life.Macleod’s friend Miles, who we also meet in the film, operated by a very different code. Miles is a practicing Sith.The Sith Code is very much antithetical to the code of the Jedi, stressing emotion and power over peace and harmony.The Sith Code“My student, who I had said was a Jedi Knight, not only tossed the Jedi path away, to follow and explore the Sith path,” says Macleod, “but also slept with a Sith.”It was the ultimate betrayal.Fueled by the personal tragedy, this is where Macleod’s hero journey, and the film, ultimately begins. After years away from the community, Macleod has returned to the ways of the Jedi, even taking on a new student, a former marine named Perris Cartwright.Cartwright, we learn, is dealing with personal trauma of her own, coming to terms with the multiple rapes she suffered while in the marine corps. Reconciling the brutality of her military past with the peaceful existence of the Jedi is “a huge conflict of interest,” she says.“Jediism wasn’t like a magic wand. It was a learning process,” says Cartwright. “It was like scraping my fist against the cement for a lot of years.”For Macleod and Cartwright, Jediism, like many religions, is a way of life, but also a tool used to navigate through tough times.“Perris and Opie are two wounded souls,” Malaquais says. “It is those wounds that brought them to the Jedi path.”What Malaquais didn’t expect was how his own spirituality would change over the course of filming, and the lesson he would learn from his main character, Opie.“I did not think that I’d be able to use Jediism in regards to my own personal struggles,” he says. “Opie Macleod taught me a valuable lesson. Whenever you are confronted with a difficult situation in life, the very first thing you must do is fully accept it.”So, is Jediism a real religion? After all, religions each contain their own mythologies, and “Star Wars” creator George Lucas has always been open about the influence that mythologists like Joseph Campbell had on the series. “I do believe Jediism is very much a religion,” says Malaquais. “Simply because it’s inspired by ancient religious practices and it definitely takes the place of religion in the lives of Jedi.” “American Jedi” is now available on iTunes.

Next year’s election will shape the course of history. The United States, once a beacon of hope and freedom to the world, can either continue down a road of isolationism, white nationalism, protectionism, and yes - of fascism, or we can signal to the world that Trumpism is not compatible with American values after all.Knowing just how important next year’s election is, I’ve committed myself to joining the fight. For a while I wasn’t sure how I should focus my energy. Should I stay in Illinois and work to get Bruce Rauner out of the Governor’s Mansion? Should I try to work for an activist organization like Let America Vote that fights for a cause I believe in? Or should I move back home to Ohio to work in a swing state that, by a wide margin, voted for Donald Trump? Nearly every single person I look up to in politics counseled me to go back to Ohio. I initially resisted that advice. For a long time, all I ever wanted to do was leave Ohio and start a new life of my own. When I got a scholarship to attend the University of Chicago, that dream had finally come true. The thought of going back and leaving the incredible life, complete with friends that had become family, on a personal level, was gut wrenching. But, as I thought about it more and more - deep down I knew that I could make the biggest impact back home. The fact of the matter is that Chicago isn’t turning red anytime soon. Political analysts expect Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania to turn back to blue. Ohio, on the other hand, is a different story. Many analysts think the state could lose its swing state status and evolve into a Republican stronghold. With Republicans holding a firm grip on the statehouse - a 23-9 advantage in the upper house, a 65-33 advantage in the lower house, control of the Governorship, and a US Congressional delegation advantage 12-4 - it’s hard to argue that Ohio is indeed a swing state. This year, 75% of the Ohio State Legislature is up for reelection. There’s an open Governor’s race with incumbent, John Kasich, term limited. All 16 Representatives to Congress will face reelection. Widely popular Senator Sherrod Brown, one of only two Democrats in office who have been elected statewide, will be on the ballot. Ohio, quite frankly, will be the battleground where the future of the United States and both political parties will be determined.Over time, it became clear to me that I wanted to be in Ohio. Instinctually, I looked to my Congressional District, OH-4, a true Republican stronghold. I reasoned that I could have the greatest responsibility and impact on a smaller campaign and that having grown up in the district came with certain advantages. Despite the fact that the district was solidly red, I hoped that I could help chip away at the margins and at least give someone a chance, even though it may be a small one, to win. Despite the fact I questioned how much I could help any candidate win such a gerrymandered district, I knew that the Democratic campaign in the district would be important.Political pundits routinely speak about how the top of the ticket helps the bottom of the ticket. While this is true, I think most pundits underestimate or take for granted how important it is for the bottom of the ticket to perform and connect voters to the top of the ticket. The Democratic Party has failed in recent years in supporting campaigns at the bottom of the ticket who can effectively present the Democratic platform at the grassroots level. The end result is that for decades, most voters in districts like OH-4 have not been reached. I believe without hesitation that the Democratic platform would do far more good for people in my district than the Republican platform. I also believe that it is a colossal failure of our political system that there is such weak incentive for parties to reach these people. The Democratic party resents being called a party of the coasts, but if it wants to do well in states like Ohio, it needs to invest resources in every single district and run campaigns on the issues that affect people’s everyday lives. Fortunately, in my couple months working in Ohio, I’ve already seen the Trump effect first hand. People from all walks of life are fired up and have begun organizing. The infrastructure is being built as we speak for Democrats to compete in every single district. If Democrats can capitalize on that - not only will we pull some upsets at the local level, but the top of the ticket in every state will reap the benefits.I’m even more fired up now that I have found a candidate to fight alongside for what I believe in and to have the opportunity to be the change that I want to see in my party. My candidate, Janet Garrett, is a true progressive - a retired school teacher, former teachers union president and former volunteer of the Peace Corps. Janet is passionate, hardworking, and gracefully understands the steep uphill battle she faces next year. But more importantly, she understands how important her campaign is - both in her potential upset of extreme right wing, Freedom Caucus founder Jim Jordan, and in her support of Sherrod Brown and the eventual Gubernatorial Democratic Candidate. So that’s why I’m moving back to Ohio to unseat my Congressman - I’m fighting against a toxic Republican party that has embraced a nationalist, fear mongering, and wanna-be-dictator, in the hopes that Ohio will send a strong message to the world that America has not completely lost its way. But far more importantly, I’m fighting to help rebuild a Democratic Party that can implement a truly progressive agenda that will help people in my district realize their American Dream, a dream which I have been able to realize for myself. If you’re like me and are from Ohio, Michigan, Florida, or any other red state for that matter, consider going back home - the resistance groups, local activists, and progressive candidates are going to need all the help they can get to be successful in 2018. Not only that - consider hopping in a race that you know is a long shot in order to help build the party that can bring the change we want to see. I hope to see you on the battlefield. "

Advocates for two detainees have reached out to the National Security Council 11 times this year without a response.,2017-12-17,Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi met with U.S. President Donald Trump at the United Nations in September.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a3595a01600004700c505c8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Vice President Mike Pence on Wednesday will be in the heart of official Cairo, meeting with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to affirm the U.S. commitment to his government and using the historic city as a platform for remarks to the Muslim-majority world on the new American policy of recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.Nearly 20 U.S. citizens have become used to a different kind of Egyptian hospitality. One is a 52-year-old father who only receives his diabetes medication at random intervals, during the odd visit when prison guards decide relatives including his wife and two daughters can hand it to him. He has spent more than four years in detention without an official verdict or sentence. Another is 27 years old and desperate to complete the degree he was working on when security officers arrested him for being in the vicinity of a political protest. He had gone to the area to help his grandfather catch a bus.The two men, Mustafa Kassem and Ahmed Etiwy, and others who have yet to be publicly identified are caught up in what rights groups call the worst wave of repression in modern Egyptian history. Advocates for them and other detainees with ties to the U.S., like a pair of green card holders with multiple family members in America, see Pence’s trip as a vital moment. It’s the last chance this year for President Donald Trump’s “America First” administration ― which loudly celebrated its role in helping one detained U.S. citizen out of Egyptian custody earlier this year ― to make a real difference on the issue.Demands that Sisi release the jailed Americans “need not dominate the meetings nor distract from other important issues, yet can and do achieve big results,” said Praveen Madhiraju, a pro bono attorney for Kassem and Etiwy at the nonprofit Pretrial Rights International. Madhiraju sent a memo to Pence’s office last Monday, and other advocates told HuffPost they have been raising the cases in meetings with the State Department and influential lawmakers. On Friday, a Pence aide told HuffPost the vice president has been briefed on the issue as part of preparations for his trip.The efforts to spotlight the cases of Kassem, Etiwy and the other detainees comes after months of silence on the matter from the Trump administration. Madhiraju and another pro bono lawyer for Kassem, Fred Crombie at the firm Coblentz Patch Duffy & Bass, have reached out to the National Security Council at the White House seven times and have not received responses, according to emails shared with HuffPost. Mohamed Soltan, a Virginia resident and former Egyptian detainee himself, said he had contacted the NSC four times to no avail.Family members have had no luck either. One of Madhiraju’s emails to the NSC, in September, included an appeal from Etiwy’s mother. She wrote of entreaties she had made to White House officials that she had ”not heard any news from them and fear that they are willing to just let Ahmed stay in jail for another year or more. I want to know that President Trump is trying to get Ahmed early release or pardon immediately. I have been too patient and Ahmed also.”A spokesman for the NSC did not respond to HuffPost’s inquiry about the messages.Nor has the White House publicly commented on an August letter on the detainee issue from Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), the chair of the powerful Senate Armed Services Committee. The State Department has only recently begun to publicly acknowledge the cases, and even then only in broad terms ― though it did mention Etiwy by name and comment on details of his trial in a statement to HuffPost in September. U.S. diplomats in Cairo did not attend court hearings for the mass trial Etiwy was part of, unlike officials from Ireland who had a citizen named in the same case.The Pence aide did not comment on whether the vice president plans to mention the jailed Americans during his meeting with Sisi. ”The VP is monitoring the situation and has been briefed by his national security team on the matter,” the aide wrote in a Friday email.Trump has grown close to autocratic leaders and described U.S. criticism of other countries’ human rights records as hypocritical. Trump administration officials say that behind-the-scenes advocacy ― sometimes mixed with the kind of praise the president has lavished on Egypt’s strongman ― is the best approach to the detainee issue. The administration has issued some public criticism, citing rights concerns as a factor in its August decision to withhold part of the huge annual military aid package Egypt receives from the U.S. And Trump aides note that he did talk to Sisi about Aya Hijazi, the American aid worker released in April.“We closely follow the cases of all United States citizens detained in Egypt,” a National Security Council spokesman told HuffPost in a Friday email. “Assisting Americans abroad is of the highest importance. Officers from the United States Embassy in Cairo regularly visit detained U.S. citizens. We are in close contact with the government of Egypt on all cases and will remain so.”But that may not be enough to force change from Egypt’s general-turned-president. The U.S. government campaign for Hijazi’s release began long before Trump won the presidency. While Trump brought that effort to fruition, it’s unclear if his strategy of little public critique and quiet pushes, usually from mid-level State Department officials, can free Americans from a labyrinthine Egyptian prison system estimated to contain more than 60,000 people.“It needs to be in many ways an all-of-government approach,” said Andrew Miller, who worked on Egypt at the National Security Council from 2014 to January 2017 and at the State Department until November. “There’s a tendency within the Egyptian government to discount concerns from a single agency. When they begin to hear it from everyone ― from the White House, from the State Department, even the Department of Defense and CIA in certain cases ― then they begin to understand that it is more of a concern.” Multiple meetings with Hijazi’s advocates and statements about her imprisonment enabled the Obama administration to secure an Egyptian commitment to fast-track her case in its last few months, he said.Miller, now the deputy director for policy at the Project on Middle East Democracy, said he knows the NSC is aware of the cases of Kassem, Etiwy and the other Americans, which he said the agency began to learn about last year. He is unsure if the information has been passed to Trump ― in part because these citizens’ stories have not been widely publicized. That affects the responses of every part of the American government, from the White House to the Cairo Embassy, which he said did not share information about the cases of Kassem, Etiwy and others with the NSC until it was asked to.“To get the entire U.S. government to do something, it helps when there is a public furor,” Miller said. “The Trump administration has prioritized private engagement in trying to resolve these cases, but based on my experience there needs to be both public and private diplomacy. The public remarks in which the U.S. government expresses concern are a necessary precondition. It serves as a signal of how much we care about the status of those individuals. It also helps to create a sense within Egypt that this is a real problem, that it’s going to have the potential to make relationships scratchier.” Soltan, the former Egyptian prisoner, said it’s clear from his recent meetings in Washington that there is not much interest in the detainee issue at the top levels of the Trump administration.“It’s been quite frustrating,” he told HuffPost. “Trying the regular avenues and channels which we used to raise some of these profiles and some of these stories has not been effective. ... For example, at the State Department, desk officers and whatnot, they’re completely demoralized.

It’s just a matter of whether he wants to use his leverage for the sake of the jailed Americans.Even as he has flattered Sisi, Trump has not given in to Egyptian government demands for easier aid terms or classifying the opposition Muslim Brotherhood movement as a terror group, noted Amr Kotb, the policy director at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy. “Because of this administration avoiding public criticism, we have been able to do things we never have before. ... I think this strategy of public support with private criticism could be instrumental” in reining in Egypt’s crackdown, he said.Madhiraju, one of the lawyers for Kassem and Etiwy Madhiraju, said Trump must act because of a legal obligation and because he has already twice intervened to help free other jailed Americans abroad ― in the Hijazi case in Egypt and on behalf of UCLA basketball players recently held in China on shoplifting charges.Others in Washington say the Egyptian government’s behavior on other issues merits a muscular U.S. response. Sisi has jailed dozens of LGBTQ people since attendees raised rainbow flags at a concert in late September, and the Human Rights Campaign and partner groups arranged for an LGBTQ Egyptian to meet with the NSC last week, HRC senior international policy advocate Jeremy Kadden told HuffPost.

But there’s no guarantee headlines will prompt high-level action or reunite these American families.“This whole process, it’s emotionally draining and I describe it as a huge roller-coaster, emotionally and mentally,” Soltan said. “Nothing is for sure unless they’re out.” "
37,POLITICS,Families Of Americans Imprisoned In Egypt Pin Their Hopes On ... Mike Pence?,Akbar Shahid Ahmed,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/families-of-americans-imprisoned-in-egypt-pin-their-hopes-on-mike-pence_us_5a359556e4b01d429cc9597f,The vice president stops in Cairo this week. Advocates for two detainees have reached out to the National Security Council 11 times this year without a response.,2017-12-17,"Trump and his daughter, Ivanka, in April met at the White House with Aya Hijazi, an Egyptian-American aid worker who had just been released from three years of captivity in Egypt.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a35965b1600000d12cf19c2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Vice President Mike Pence on Wednesday will be in the heart of official Cairo, meeting with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to affirm the U.S. commitment to his government and using the historic city as a platform for remarks to the Muslim-majority world on the new American policy of recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.Nearly 20 U.S. citizens have become used to a different kind of Egyptian hospitality. One is a 52-year-old father who only receives his diabetes medication at random intervals, during the odd visit when prison guards decide relatives including his wife and two daughters can hand it to him. He has spent more than four years in detention without an official verdict or sentence. Another is 27 years old and desperate to complete the degree he was working on when security officers arrested him for being in the vicinity of a political protest. He had gone to the area to help his grandfather catch a bus.The two men, Mustafa Kassem and Ahmed Etiwy, and others who have yet to be publicly identified are caught up in what rights groups call the worst wave of repression in modern Egyptian history. Advocates for them and other detainees with ties to the U.S., like a pair of green card holders with multiple family members in America, see Pence’s trip as a vital moment. It’s the last chance this year for President Donald Trump’s “America First” administration ― which loudly celebrated its role in helping one detained U.S. citizen out of Egyptian custody earlier this year ― to make a real difference on the issue.Demands that Sisi release the jailed Americans “need not dominate the meetings nor distract from other important issues, yet can and do achieve big results,” said Praveen Madhiraju, a pro bono attorney for Kassem and Etiwy at the nonprofit Pretrial Rights International. Madhiraju sent a memo to Pence’s office last Monday, and other advocates told HuffPost they have been raising the cases in meetings with the State Department and influential lawmakers. On Friday, a Pence aide told HuffPost the vice president has been briefed on the issue as part of preparations for his trip.The efforts to spotlight the cases of Kassem, Etiwy and the other detainees comes after months of silence on the matter from the Trump administration. Madhiraju and another pro bono lawyer for Kassem, Fred Crombie at the firm Coblentz Patch Duffy & Bass, have reached out to the National Security Council at the White House seven times and have not received responses, according to emails shared with HuffPost. Mohamed Soltan, a Virginia resident and former Egyptian detainee himself, said he had contacted the NSC four times to no avail.Family members have had no luck either. One of Madhiraju’s emails to the NSC, in September, included an appeal from Etiwy’s mother. She wrote of entreaties she had made to White House officials that she had ”not heard any news from them and fear that they are willing to just let Ahmed stay in jail for another year or more. I want to know that President Trump is trying to get Ahmed early release or pardon immediately. I have been too patient and Ahmed also.”A spokesman for the NSC did not respond to HuffPost’s inquiry about the messages.Nor has the White House publicly commented on an August letter on the detainee issue from Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), the chair of the powerful Senate Armed Services Committee. The State Department has only recently begun to publicly acknowledge the cases, and even then only in broad terms ― though it did mention Etiwy by name and comment on details of his trial in a statement to HuffPost in September. U.S. diplomats in Cairo did not attend court hearings for the mass trial Etiwy was part of, unlike officials from Ireland who had a citizen named in the same case.The Pence aide did not comment on whether the vice president plans to mention the jailed Americans during his meeting with Sisi. ”The VP is monitoring the situation and has been briefed by his national security team on the matter,” the aide wrote in a Friday email.Trump has grown close to autocratic leaders and described U.S. criticism of other countries’ human rights records as hypocritical. Trump administration officials say that behind-the-scenes advocacy ― sometimes mixed with the kind of praise the president has lavished on Egypt’s strongman ― is the best approach to the detainee issue. The administration has issued some public criticism, citing rights concerns as a factor in its August decision to withhold part of the huge annual military aid package Egypt receives from the U.S. And Trump aides note that he did talk to Sisi about Aya Hijazi, the American aid worker released in April.“We closely follow the cases of all United States citizens detained in Egypt,” a National Security Council spokesman told HuffPost in a Friday email. “Assisting Americans abroad is of the highest importance. Officers from the United States Embassy in Cairo regularly visit detained U.S. citizens. We are in close contact with the government of Egypt on all cases and will remain so.”But that may not be enough to force change from Egypt’s general-turned-president. The U.S. government campaign for Hijazi’s release began long before Trump won the presidency. While Trump brought that effort to fruition, it’s unclear if his strategy of little public critique and quiet pushes, usually from mid-level State Department officials, can free Americans from a labyrinthine Egyptian prison system estimated to contain more than 60,000 people.“It needs to be in many ways an all-of-government approach,” said Andrew Miller, who worked on Egypt at the National Security Council from 2014 to January 2017 and at the State Department until November. “There’s a tendency within the Egyptian government to discount concerns from a single agency. When they begin to hear it from everyone ― from the White House, from the State Department, even the Department of Defense and CIA in certain cases ― then they begin to understand that it is more of a concern.” Multiple meetings with Hijazi’s advocates and statements about her imprisonment enabled the Obama administration to secure an Egyptian commitment to fast-track her case in its last few months, he said.Miller, now the deputy director for policy at the Project on Middle East Democracy, said he knows the NSC is aware of the cases of Kassem, Etiwy and the other Americans, which he said the agency began to learn about last year. He is unsure if the information has been passed to Trump ― in part because these citizens’ stories have not been widely publicized. That affects the responses of every part of the American government, from the White House to the Cairo Embassy, which he said did not share information about the cases of Kassem, Etiwy and others with the NSC until it was asked to.“To get the entire U.S. government to do something, it helps when there is a public furor,” Miller said. “The Trump administration has prioritized private engagement in trying to resolve these cases, but based on my experience there needs to be both public and private diplomacy. The public remarks in which the U.S. government expresses concern are a necessary precondition. It serves as a signal of how much we care about the status of those individuals. It also helps to create a sense within Egypt that this is a real problem, that it’s going to have the potential to make relationships scratchier.” Soltan, the former Egyptian prisoner, said it’s clear from his recent meetings in Washington that there is not much interest in the detainee issue at the top levels of the Trump administration.“It’s been quite frustrating,” he told HuffPost. “Trying the regular avenues and channels which we used to raise some of these profiles and some of these stories has not been effective. ... For example, at the State Department, desk officers and whatnot, they’re completely demoralized. They cannot reach senior leadership and even when they do, the White House is on a different track.”Soltan believes lawmakers and congressional staff interested in the issue are now choosing to spend less time on it because their lobbying has yet to lead to any concrete administration steps.The irony is that some national security experts believe Trump’s broader approach to Egypt makes it more likely he can get concessions from Sisi’s government.

38,ENTERTAINMENT,‘The Voice’ Is Great TV. It’s Just Not Always Great For The Winners.,Leigh Blickley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-voice-success-for-winners_us_5a0b545ee4b00a6eece4e116,"A handful of former contestants, plus host and producer Carson Daly, break down what happens after each season wraps.",2017-12-17,"""Voice"" winners Danielle Bradbery (season four), left, Sawyer Fredericks (season eight), Tessanne Chin (season five), Cassadee Pope (season three), Jordan Smith (season nine) and Chris Blue (season 12).",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a1dd87c140000196c50fb24.jpeg?cache=GLr37Ay857&ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"Currently in its 13th season, NBC’s “The Voice” seems to have officially cracked the secret reality-TV code and struck gold.Fresh off a third consecutive Emmy win for outstanding reality-competition program, the show has proved that, six years into its run, it’s still capable of reeling in viewers. Recent ratings rival its debut season; this week, nearly 10 million people in the demographic of viewers ages 18-49 tuned in to watch the Top 8 perform, on par with numbers from season one.“Whatever the DNA is that’s making it successful, it just hasn’t changed,” the show’s host and executive producer, Carson Daly, told HuffPost. “It still feels like important, special, fresh, eventized, feel-good TV. All those early themes we wanted to roll out into the marketplace have stood as the pillar of what makes the show successful.” Those early themes Daly’s talking about center on one primary ideal: giving someone who’s been attempting to break into the music industry the opportunity of a lifetime. Singers of all shapes, sizes, ages, backgrounds, races and gender identities are provided the chance to perform in a blind audition on “The Voice,” during which four superstar coaches (not judges) sit with their backs to the stage, hoping to hear the next Whitney Houston, Justin Timberlake or Taylor Swift. From there, the contestants sing to an audience of at-home viewers eager to vote them into potential stardom. A $100,000 cash prize and a record deal with Republic Records, a subsidiary of Universal Music Group, or, in some cases, with pop and country label Big Machine is on the line. “Where else can you come on a show and sing and not be judged on anything but your talent, your voice?” the show’s executive producer Audrey Morrissey told HuffPost. “You’re in one-on-one tutoring with these people who are doing nothing but trying to shine a light on you and give you the fruits of all their experience in a very concentrated time to help you: to help you win the show, to help you win your career, to help you become a better artist. It’s literally priceless. Money can’t buy that.” Of course, the coaches on “The Voice,” the ones who sit in those massive red chairs that dramatically swivel around at the push of a button, have other motives beyond a desire to “shine a light” on fresh talent. “They’re making a lot of money, too, so don’t forget about that,” Daly joked.According to The Wrap, Blake Shelton and Adam Levine each make about $13 million a season. And the show not only gives unknown artists a platform but allows its star coaches one, as well. On primetime TV, they can expand their careers by flaunting family-friendly personalities and premiering new music. Before “The Voice,” for example, longtime coach Shelton had hit after hit on the country music charts with No. 1 songs like “Austin,” “Some Beach” and “All About Tonight.” But since his first stint on the show in 2011, his albums have gained mainstream appeal, with “Red River Blue” and “Bringing Back the Sunshine” both landing at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, at points surpassing the likes of Adele’s “21.”With all of its addictive goodness, you’d think the artists emerging from “The Voice” would also gain some momentum in the music business. However, the popularity of the show and its celebrity mentors doesn’t necessarily trickle down to the artists the network highlights for months on end. In truth, the show’s 12 winners have produced only five original Top 40 songs and earned one Grammy nomination from 2011 to now. And most of the winners’ singles that ranked on the Hot 100 were either “Voice” performances or original victory songs. Cassadee Pope and Danielle Bradbery are the only artists whose post-“Voice” singles have charted on the list.Unlike the coaches whose fame continues to flourish, it seems many “Voice” winners fare worse in the great expanses of the fair-weather music industry. The days of Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood ― who, after being crowned the champions of “American Idol” in 2002 and 2005, respectively, went on to earn a combined 10 Grammy Awards ― are gone. Today, “The Voice” might do everything in its power to make sure the viewers who vote are captivated by the show’s talent in-season. But once those artists are thrust into the music world, why do we rarely hear about them post-show?We do hear about some winners, like Jordan Smith, whose success was personally fostered by executive “Voice” producer Mark Burnett and his wife, Roma Downey. After flawlessly singing Sia’s “Chandelier” to an incredulous row of coaches on the show, he went on to nab three Top 40 hits and three No. 1s on the Hot Christian Songs chart. His first album, “Something Beautiful,” was a critical and commercial success story as it debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard chart in March 2016, right behind “Voice” coach Gwen Stefani’s “This Is What the Truth Feels Like.” Smith sold 54,000 units in the album’s first week, making making it one of the highest-ranking debuts of a singing competition series winner in the last several years. Nine months later, his holiday album, “’Tis the Season,” peaked at No. 11. He has been touring nationwide ever since. And then there’s Cassadee Pope, who signed to Big Machine after her win. (A source close to the company confirmed to HuffPost that Pope and the label decided to “mutually” part ways this year.) Now in the country domain, the former pop-punk singer has drawn comparisons to alternative vocalists like Avril Lavigne with her radio-primed voice. The season three champ has produced four Top 40 hits, two of those ― “Over You” and “Stupid Boy” ― being “Voice” performances. Her 2013 hit “Wasting All These Tears” landed at No. 37 and has been played more than 19 million times on Spotify. Her debut solo country record, “Frame by Frame,” also scored a No. 9 placement on the Billboard 200 and sold 43,000 copies in its first week. Just this year, Pope was nominated for a Grammy for best country duo/group performance for her song with Chris Young, “Think of You.”When asked who he thinks truly embodies a “Voice” success story, Daly cited the 28-year-old Florida native. “Cassadee was like a rocker chick in an all-boy band [Hey Monday], almost like Gwen in No Doubt, and she went on Team Blake and now I’ve seen her on red carpets and in Nashville,” he said.Another notable mention is season four winner Danielle Bradbery, who, although not a mainstream darling, has achieved success in the country music realm. The Houston native was 16 when she won the show and went on to release her self-titled debut album just five months later. Like Pope, Bradbery signed to Big Machine. “We knew she had a chance, and we definitely wanted her if she was going to win,” a Big Machine representative told HuffPost. “That was at the height, when media was just like, ‘The Voice, The Voice, The Voice!’”“They knew exactly what we needed to do as soon as I was off ‘The Voice,’ and so they flew me to Nashville and got an album cooking,” Bradbery told HuffPost of her experience with her management team. “Everything was really fast, but I knew they knew what they were doing... they had a plan. They got me on the ‘Today’ show right away, and are just big fans of getting the names and faces out there as much as possible and as fast as possible.” Bradbery’s 2013 single “The Heart of Dixie” peaked at No. 58 on the Hot 100 and performed decently on the Country chart. She toured with Brad Paisley and went on to produce an anthem for the promotional campaign of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi with “My Day.” Bradbery pushed forward with the release of her sophomore album, “I Don’t Believe We’ve Met,” on Dec. 1, and it’s currently No. 41 on the Billboard 200. Her lead single “Sway,” which features more pop-inspired undertones, was released in June and peaked at No. 19 on the Country Digital Songs Sales chart.“If I’m being honest, I didn’t know much about the whole other side of the music industry that you have to create for yourself and your teams... management, label, booking agents, everything along those lines,” she said. “It was definitely a learning experience every step of the way.”As it still is for season 12 winner Chris Blue. Instead of rushing forward with his debut album, the R&B singer from Knoxville, Tennessee, is working diligently with his former coach and now manager, Alicia Keys. “I watch Alicia and how she works, and she goes nonstop,” Blue told HuffPost. “After the show and putting in long hours every day, I realized, ‘Hey, this has to continue. This is now my lifestyle. You have to work hard in this business.’”Daly and Morrissey agree. They say “The Voice” is more of a boot camp than a superstar generator, so if people want to make it in the cutthroat entertainment industry, they’re expected to put their blood, sweat and tears into their own development. Winning, they insist, is hard work.In fact, the producers never wanted to mimic “Idol,” even if it “blazed a path” for them in the TV landscape, Daly said. “We didn’t really create the show to create a celebrity musician or make people rich and famous. That was never really the goal of the show. We are proud to say that so many of the artists who have been on ‘The Voice’ in any capacity have quit their sandwich-making jobs and are doing well in music. And at the end of the day that’s winning, to us.”But not every artist who’s deemed “The Voice” triumphs. For every Christian singer like Smith or country fave like Pope and Bradbery, you have a handful of “winners” who enjoy less of the sensation of a post-“Voice” career. Take, for example, season one runner-up Dia Frampton, who found some success in the early aughts alongside her sister in the indie-rock band Meg & Dia. During her time on “The Voice,” she said, the show, like many other reality programs, attempted to shape and mold its contestants’ stories to attract viewers, not necessarily lifelong fans. “I was introduced as the children’s book author, which was something I very lightly touched upon when we were doing interviews — that I liked writing children’s books, I liked blogging and writing stories. But that was definitely not the highlight in my own mind,” Frampton explained. “I felt like I said, ‘I love yoga,’ and then it became the highlight, even though that’s just a fun thing I do on Saturday mornings. That was interesting, to kind of have that narrative chosen for me.”Other handpicked narratives include We McDonald’s experience with bullying, Janice Freeman’s life as a single mom and cancer survivor and Dylan Gerard’s decision to enter the medical field after his sister’s tragic car accident, all aiming to tug the heartstrings of viewers week by week.Frampton didn’t see herself as a children’s book author. Nor did she think she’d make it that far on the show. Her “sole intention” behind appearing on “The Voice” was to slip in Meg & Dia stories in hopes of getting the duo back on their feet after they spent all their savings on their 2011 album, “Cocoon.” “In the moment, we had been dropped from our label, we didn’t have a publicist, we didn’t have money, and I thought, ‘This is our publicity, possibly,’” she said. “But the band was never mentioned. I mean, I mentioned it, but it was never put on the show.” After Frampton finished second, she was picked up by Universal Republic to kick off a solo career. All the while, her sister Meg was left wondering what could’ve been. “Honestly, there was aftermath to that decision for years,” Dia said. “I think that last year was the first year I felt normal again with my sister, and that’s been a lot of work on our part... I still feel like I abandoned her in a way, and I struggle to deal with that in trying to be successful. I feel like sometimes I wish to not be successful so that I don’t do well and don’t abandon her again.” Following her season’s wrap, Dia and her new team whipped together an album in a few months, which she said was pushed on her by the label. ”I felt like the record was rushed to be put out,” she said of 2011’s “Red.” “I was so excited to work with so many different producers that I think I should’ve focused on working with one person who I really loved because the album kind of ended up being a crazy plethora of songs in all different genres.” Despite that, she insists her time on “The Voice” was a learning experience that led her to open for her coach Shelton and go on tour with James Blunt in China. According to Dia, she thought she’d found her stride when “Red” went double-platinum in parts of Southeast Asia, but shortly after a year of celebrity, she was back to the life of a struggling artist. Now she can’t even go out on tour because she fails to sell enough tickets or make enough money to promote her new album, “Bruises.” She’s currently working at a health food store, making minimum wage, while writing songs for other artists. “I look back at my time, not so much on ‘The Voice’ but post-‘Voice,’ because I felt like that was such a spike in my career and life... It felt like I was doing everything right and I was going to be OK and I was bearing on what I think was success, and then everything just kind of falls down,” she said, getting emotional. “That’s one thing you have to be prepared for as an artist. You have your ups and you have your downs, and your ups feel so amazing and your downs feel so difficult. And I feel like I am in a bit of a down right now. I feel like I’ve been throwing spaghetti at the wall for so long trying to make something hit, just kind of helping other artists get their voice out when I feel like mine is kind of going deeper and deeper into a hole.” There’s no sure way to determine why some artists soar after “The Voice” while others fall flat, but it appears a lot has to do with who’s in a contestant’s corner after they graduate from the show. For example, if talent isn’t thoroughly supported by Universal Music Group after a season ends, albums can go unproduced, unpromoted and unsold. Morrissey explained that, at its discretion, the pop-focused Republic Records chooses how many people it wants to pick up once the finale airs. Sometimes it partners with other labels, like Big Machine, if it thinks it’s not the best fit for a specific artist. “Pretty much all the winners are picked up,” Morrissey said. “There is choice amongst the label what they do with them, but we, as a television show, once they won, we’re not necessarily personally involved in their careers. We do everything in our power to prop them up, as we can, but that’s when it flips over to, really, the music business.”“When the baton is passed post-‘Voice,’ there’s some problems,” Levine told Howard Stern in 2015, suggesting that the label “fucks it up” because “no one knows what they’re doing.” He continued, “People take over after we do this great job of building these people up on the show. There’s some real issues there.”Season eight winner Sawyer Fredericks had an inconvenient experience shortly after being crowned “The Voice” in 2015. The now 18-year-old said he dropped Republic after his first album, “The Good Storm,” was released, over disagreements about his songwriting process. “It was kind of a mutual decision,” Fredericks told HuffPost, explaining that the label had him co-writing the record even though he wanted to pen his own lyrics. “I think it definitely changed my intent for a lot of songs.”For his sophomore album, “Hide Your Ghost,” the now independent singer-songwriter ― who lives on a farm with his family in upstate New York ― wants to take back control of his sound.“I wanted the freedom as full producer. Basically, whatever I say happens with the album, and I have the final word for everything... really conveying what I mean in my original work,” he explained.Fredericks is not the only “Voice” winner to go independent. After the label didn’t fully support his album “Come Through for You,” season one’s Javier Colon voluntarily moved on from Republic. Despite having catchy, potential hits like “Stand Up” (featuring Levine and co-written by Pharrell WIlliams), Colon’s music never got its due.“I went in with high hopes, as I believe everyone did,” Colon told Buddy TV in 2012. “But when you pour your heart and soul into a new album that you think is really great, and your label who is supposed to support, market and promote your music does neither, it’s really hard not to be upset.”Season 11’s Alisan Porter decided to part ways with Republic, too. The former child star (“Curly Sue,” “Parenthood”), now 36, initially took to Twitter to share the news that she was going independent.“It just wasn’t the right fit for me,” she told People earlier this year. “I have a really clear vision of who I am, and it might not be the most cookie-cutter commercial radio [vision]... I would much rather be true to myself than to do something that didn’t feel right for me.” Same goes for season five winner Tessanne Chin. Her debut album with Republic, “Count on My Love,” sold only 7,000 copies in its first week due to what she deems a lack of promotion. Now the 32-year-old Jamaican reggae-R&B singer is signed to the Justice League Music Group. She’s been performing frequently enough, but hasn’t seen the kind of success Pope and Bradbery have. See also: winners Jermaine Paul, Josh Kaufman, Craig Wayne Boyd and Sundance Head, who have yet to release albums with Republic Records, and perhaps never will.So, what gives? As more and more singing competition “winners” become “losers,” who’s at fault? And is there anything that can revive the once-sensational reality show dream?“You can’t blame a record company or management because, I think, in today’s day and age, you can ‘succeed’ and really take off without it because of the tools that are available to you independently,” Daly said. “A hit song is a hit song is a hit song, and I don’t care who sings it. You can ask Charlie Puth or Meghan Trainor; Fall Out Boy did this back in the day without any help from radio. If you have a hit song, it’s going to happen for you. It’s just a matter of time.” According to a Big Machine rep, it’s sometimes difficult to market “Voice” talent after the show, in part due to their network association. Because “The Voice” is on NBC, other companies, like CBS or ABC, won’t feature the show’s artists. “The networks are so competitive with one another that you need not only a label behind you, [but] you need to make sure the network is behind you and going to support you beyond you just being on their show,” the rep said. “If you’re stuck to only being able to do the ‘Today’ show or ‘Access Hollywood’ or another NBC platform, it’s limiting.” Morrissey says, record deal or not, “The Voice” tries to highlight former contestants whenever it can. Just this week, Alisan Porter was able to promote her Las Vegas show, “The Voice: Neon Dreams,” which is set to give artists, including Chris Mann (season two), Mary Sarah (season 10), Matthew Schuler (season five) and Matt McAndrew (season seven), a new platform, boosting their profiles once more. “The Voice” also recently highlighted past contestants’ journeys on the web-exclusive series “After The Voice.” “We do try to keep tabs on them. We do invite them back and have them perform on the show when they’re ready and they have music. To the best of our ability we push all of their work on all our socials. We try to do what we can,” Morrissey said. “It is what it is. We try our best.”Fredericks, for one, confirmed that “The Voice” producers have kept tabs on him and his career. “I don’t think it’s completely like I’m on my own. They’ve helped out quite a bit, and they’ve offered me to do stuff with the show,” he said. “It’s really fun to go back; it’s like a whole family. And it’s still going! This show, like everything, is just go, go, go.”The coaches are also a big part of the equation. Bradbery’s former mentor, Shelton, who she called “very genuine,” pays attention to the music she’s releasing. He congratulated her on a recent single, which Bradbery said he does as often as he can. “He definitely keeps everybody that’s been on his team under his wing, which I think is really amazing about him. What you see on TV of Blake is exactly what you’ll get. He’s not fake.” The same could be said about most of the coaches who attempt to stay in contact with their contestants after “The Voice,” Morrissey said. Levine has signed former artists to his record label, 222, while Keys continues to work and write with Blue.“Coaches go to a lot of lengths to help people keep growing far more than the public sees. We just don’t really have enough time or way on our show to illustrate that,” Morrissey said. “I’m just thinking about Christina [Aguilera] and Alisan Porter ― they’re still very close and work together. Miley [Cyrus], famously, my God, she keeps in touch with everybody, is texting constantly.”“It’s more than just a season to them or show or just a moment in time, but they really take on the artists as their own and really care about these individuals,” Blue told HuffPost.However, it’s not just the winning artists who take their shot in the ruthless world of music post-“Voice.” Throughout every season of the show, hundreds of contestants rotate in and out of the spotlight. Another famous reality show contestant is proof you don’t have to win to win: Jennifer Hudson. She is currently a coach on “The Voice,” but she placed seventh in the 2004 season of “American Idol.” She’s since won a Grammy for her album “Jennifer Hudson,” and Oscar, Golden Globe, British Academy Film and Screen Actors Guild awards for her role as Effie White in 2006’s “Dreamgirls.” Perhaps, with her experience, she can help guide her three eliminated live-show contestants, Davon Fleming, Shi’Ann Jones and Noah Mac, to mainstream success without a crown.“When she’s looking at them and saying, ‘I’ve been you. I’ve been right where you are. I know how to do this. I know how you’re feeling. I can help you navigate the waters once we’re successful.’ I mean, how do you not take somebody up on that offer? That’s valuable,” Daly said. “And having Kelly [Clarkson] on next season, too, will be the same thing.”In Clarkson’s mind, making your way to the top of the music charts after appearing on a singing competition show has a lot to do with perseverance. But, of course, luck plays a role, too. “The question is always, ‘Why does this one make it and why didn’t this one?’ And it’s hard to tell you that because I think if we knew the answer we’d bottle it up and sell it so everybody could make it,” Clarkson told HuffPost. “Jennifer Hudson and I had this talk when I worked with her recently. We were both like, ‘You know, it’s really not even winning.’ Like she’s the best example of that. It’s taking that opportunity, making something of it and being OK with the fact that it might not be exactly what you thought it was going to be.”We’ve seen that sort of attitude with “Voice” contestants like RaeLynn, who, at 23, is now one of the most sought-after songwriters in Nashville after being eliminated in the quarterfinals of season two. Her debut album, “Wildhorse,” hit No. 1 on Billboard’s Country Albums Chart and landed within the Top 10 on the All-Genre Album Sales Chart in 2017. This success, though, came after she left Big Machine and joined forces with Warner Music Nashville, which helped her sink into who she wanted to be as an artist. Under its guidance, she wrote “Love Triangle,” which garnered her a whole lot of attention for its raw and honest lyrics about being a child of divorce. “Within a week, I had so many other writers who wanted to write with me because of that song,” RaeLynn told Billboard. “It goes to show a great song is what can change a lot for you, and that’s what that song did for me.” RaeLynn credited Nashville as a pivotal environment. This might explain why a select few winners have flourished when they focused on Music City. “Everybody knows everybody, and when they find out there’s a new artist that’s great, everybody is going to support them,” she said. “They don’t just support artists who’ve already made it. They want to support new artists, and I think that’s so special.” And it seems country music listeners want to support emerging artists, as well. A source close to “The Voice” told HuffPost that voting during the show typically takes off in local markets when there’s a particularly moving performance. For example, when Sundance Head advanced in the competition, “The Voice” saw a huge spike in voters from Texas. “A lot of people who haven’t won the show [and are successful] are just people from Team Blake... He’s from that world and they take care of their own, no doubt about it,” Daly said, mentioning acts like RaeLynn, the Swon Brothers and Gwen Sebastian, who toured with Shelton and wrote three songs on Miranda Lambert’s latest critically acclaimed album, “The Weight of These Wings.”Ultimately, Clarkson believes no singing competition winner should ever feel like they’re automatically going to be a superstar with a dozen No. 1s. “That’s a level of entitlement that’s going to end up not really working out well,” she advised.“TV is so powerful, right? Use that platform and use that stage to really showcase what you have, and then use that opportunity to meet as many people as you can meet. That’s all we can really do because there’s no rhyme or reason to why some of us make it and some of us don’t. We all work hard. But some of it is the aligning of the stars.”Even with the ups and downs, most if not all of the contestants HuffPost spoke to had nothing but fond memories from their time on “The Voice,” and credited the show for giving them a place to shine.“I loved it as a learning experience, and I’m happy I did it,” Fredericks said. Bradbery and Blue expressed similar sentiments. “If it wasn’t for ‘The Voice,’ I’d be home doing regular stuff, so it was probably the biggest high moment of my whole entire life,” Bradbery said. “It’s been amazing.” “‘The Voice’ is a really great concept,” Frampton said. “At first, I honestly thought, ‘OK, this has to be rigged. Somebody has to tell the coaches to turn around for certain people.’ But going through the show and seeing the process, I truly believe that it is very genuine.”Despite the inconsistent track record, the hope for post-show success persists. “The Voice” is expected to continue running two cycles a year until ratings dip (which likely won’t happen anytime soon). Daly said that because there’s so much content out there, in order to stay relevant you have to be on top of your game. “There’s very little appointment viewing,” he said. “If you go away too long, you run the risk of just like falling into oblivion. There’s a successful Mark Burnett competition reality program [‘Survivor’] that’s been on twice a year on CBS for 35 seasons, and it works!”Daly and Morrissey also know their show is entertaining a robust audience and fills that feel-good void on TV. Because when it comes down to it, the winners of “The Voice” are the network, the coaches and, undoubtedly, the devoted fans who get to see a produced version of the American Dream play out before them. They might not be tuning in to vote for album sales or chart appearances, but they’re glued to their seats in anticipation of each season’s climax.Win or lose, prevailing after “The Voice,” like any other talent show, is the luck of the draw. But who knows? With a younger, more pop-rock-inspired crop of season 13 finalists (including Brooke Simpson, 26, Chloe Kohanski, 23, and Addison Agen, 16), the future winner could fare better. There’s still a country singer in the mix, though, ahead of next week’s finale, 40-year-old Red Marlow. Will a Tennessee crooner reign supreme once again? If we had to guess, we’d say yes.UPDATE: (Dec. 20) ― Rock-pop singer Chloe Kohanski was crowned Season 13′s “The Voice.” With that, her coach, Blake Shelton, secured his sixth win. Additional reporting by Lauren Moraski. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated the title of Stefani’s album. It is “This Is What the Truth Feels Like” not “What the Truth Feels Like.” It also incorrectly indicated Jordan Smith’s debut album was the best-selling album from the winner of any singing competition series in the last six years.

Recent ratings rival its debut season; this week, nearly 10 million people in the demographic of viewers ages 18-49 tuned in to watch the Top 8 perform, on par with numbers from season one.“Whatever the DNA is that’s making it successful, it just hasn’t changed,” the show’s host and executive producer, Carson Daly, told HuffPost. “It still feels like important, special, fresh, eventized, feel-good TV. All those early themes we wanted to roll out into the marketplace have stood as the pillar of what makes the show successful.” Those early themes Daly’s talking about center on one primary ideal: giving someone who’s been attempting to break into the music industry the opportunity of a lifetime. Singers of all shapes, sizes, ages, backgrounds, races and gender identities are provided the chance to perform in a blind audition on “The Voice,” during which four superstar coaches (not judges) sit with their backs to the stage, hoping to hear the next Whitney Houston, Justin Timberlake or Taylor Swift. From there, the contestants sing to an audience of at-home viewers eager to vote them into potential stardom. A $100,000 cash prize and a record deal with Republic Records, a subsidiary of Universal Music Group, or, in some cases, with pop and country label Big Machine is on the line. “Where else can you come on a show and sing and not be judged on anything but your talent, your voice?” the show’s executive producer Audrey Morrissey told HuffPost. “You’re in one-on-one tutoring with these people who are doing nothing but trying to shine a light on you and give you the fruits of all their experience in a very concentrated time to help you: to help you win the show, to help you win your career, to help you become a better artist. It’s literally priceless. Money can’t buy that.” Of course, the coaches on “The Voice,” the ones who sit in those massive red chairs that dramatically swivel around at the push of a button, have other motives beyond a desire to “shine a light” on fresh talent. “They’re making a lot of money, too, so don’t forget about that,” Daly joked.According to The Wrap, Blake Shelton and Adam Levine each make about $13 million a season. And the show not only gives unknown artists a platform but allows its star coaches one, as well. On primetime TV, they can expand their careers by flaunting family-friendly personalities and premiering new music. Before “The Voice,” for example, longtime coach Shelton had hit after hit on the country music charts with No. 1 songs like “Austin,” “Some Beach” and “All About Tonight.” But since his first stint on the show in 2011, his albums have gained mainstream appeal, with “Red River Blue” and “Bringing Back the Sunshine” both landing at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, at points surpassing the likes of Adele’s “21.”With all of its addictive goodness, you’d think the artists emerging from “The Voice” would also gain some momentum in the music business. However, the popularity of the show and its celebrity mentors doesn’t necessarily trickle down to the artists the network highlights for months on end. In truth, the show’s 12 winners have produced only five original Top 40 songs and earned one Grammy nomination from 2011 to now. And most of the winners’ singles that ranked on the Hot 100 were either “Voice” performances or original victory songs. Cassadee Pope and Danielle Bradbery are the only artists whose post-“Voice” singles have charted on the list.Unlike the coaches whose fame continues to flourish, it seems many “Voice” winners fare worse in the great expanses of the fair-weather music industry. The days of Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood ― who, after being crowned the champions of “American Idol” in 2002 and 2005, respectively, went on to earn a combined 10 Grammy Awards ― are gone. Today, “The Voice” might do everything in its power to make sure the viewers who vote are captivated by the show’s talent in-season. But once those artists are thrust into the music world, why do we rarely hear about them post-show?We do hear about some winners, like Jordan Smith, whose success was personally fostered by executive “Voice” producer Mark Burnett and his wife, Roma Downey. After flawlessly singing Sia’s “Chandelier” to an incredulous row of coaches on the show, he went on to nab three Top 40 hits and three No. 1s on the Hot Christian Songs chart. His first album, “Something Beautiful,” was a critical and commercial success story as it debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard chart in March 2016, right behind “Voice” coach Gwen Stefani’s “This Is What the Truth Feels Like.” Smith sold 54,000 units in the album’s first week, making making it one of the highest-ranking debuts of a singing competition series winner in the last several years. Nine months later, his holiday album, “’Tis the Season,” peaked at No. 11. He has been touring nationwide ever since. And then there’s Cassadee Pope, who signed to Big Machine after her win. (A source close to the company confirmed to HuffPost that Pope and the label decided to “mutually” part ways this year.) Now in the country domain, the former pop-punk singer has drawn comparisons to alternative vocalists like Avril Lavigne with her radio-primed voice. The season three champ has produced four Top 40 hits, two of those ― “Over You” and “Stupid Boy” ― being “Voice” performances. Her 2013 hit “Wasting All These Tears” landed at No. 37 and has been played more than 19 million times on Spotify. Her debut solo country record, “Frame by Frame,” also scored a No. 9 placement on the Billboard 200 and sold 43,000 copies in its first week. Just this year, Pope was nominated for a Grammy for best country duo/group performance for her song with Chris Young, “Think of You.”When asked who he thinks truly embodies a “Voice” success story, Daly cited the 28-year-old Florida native. “Cassadee was like a rocker chick in an all-boy band [Hey Monday], almost like Gwen in No Doubt, and she went on Team Blake and now I’ve seen her on red carpets and in Nashville,” he said.Another notable mention is season four winner Danielle Bradbery, who, although not a mainstream darling, has achieved success in the country music realm. The Houston native was 16 when she won the show and went on to release her self-titled debut album just five months later. Like Pope, Bradbery signed to Big Machine. “We knew she had a chance, and we definitely wanted her if she was going to win,” a Big Machine representative told HuffPost. “That was at the height, when media was just like, ‘The Voice, The Voice, The Voice!’”“They knew exactly what we needed to do as soon as I was off ‘The Voice,’ and so they flew me to Nashville and got an album cooking,” Bradbery told HuffPost of her experience with her management team. “Everything was really fast, but I knew they knew what they were doing... they had a plan. They got me on the ‘Today’ show right away, and are just big fans of getting the names and faces out there as much as possible and as fast as possible.” Bradbery’s 2013 single “The Heart of Dixie” peaked at No. 58 on the Hot 100 and performed decently on the Country chart. She toured with Brad Paisley and went on to produce an anthem for the promotional campaign of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi with “My Day.” Bradbery pushed forward with the release of her sophomore album, “I Don’t Believe We’ve Met,” on Dec. 1, and it’s currently No. 41 on the Billboard 200. Her lead single “Sway,” which features more pop-inspired undertones, was released in June and peaked at No. 19 on the Country Digital Songs Sales chart.“If I’m being honest, I didn’t know much about the whole other side of the music industry that you have to create for yourself and your teams... management, label, booking agents, everything along those lines,” she said. “It was definitely a learning experience every step of the way.”As it still is for season 12 winner Chris Blue. Instead of rushing forward with his debut album, the R&B singer from Knoxville, Tennessee, is working diligently with his former coach and now manager, Alicia Keys. “I watch Alicia and how she works, and she goes nonstop,” Blue told HuffPost. “After the show and putting in long hours every day, I realized, ‘Hey, this has to continue. This is now my lifestyle. You have to work hard in this business.’”Daly and Morrissey agree. They say “The Voice” is more of a boot camp than a superstar generator, so if people want to make it in the cutthroat entertainment industry, they’re expected to put their blood, sweat and tears into their own development. Winning, they insist, is hard work.In fact, the producers never wanted to mimic “Idol,” even if it “blazed a path” for them in the TV landscape, Daly said. “We didn’t really create the show to create a celebrity musician or make people rich and famous. That was never really the goal of the show. We are proud to say that so many of the artists who have been on ‘The Voice’ in any capacity have quit their sandwich-making jobs and are doing well in music. And at the end of the day that’s winning, to us.”But not every artist who’s deemed “The Voice” triumphs. For every Christian singer like Smith or country fave like Pope and Bradbery, you have a handful of “winners” who enjoy less of the sensation of a post-“Voice” career. Take, for example, season one runner-up Dia Frampton, who found some success in the early aughts alongside her sister in the indie-rock band Meg & Dia. During her time on “The Voice,” she said, the show, like many other reality programs, attempted to shape and mold its contestants’ stories to attract viewers, not necessarily lifelong fans. “I was introduced as the children’s book author, which was something I very lightly touched upon when we were doing interviews — that I liked writing children’s books, I liked blogging and writing stories. But that was definitely not the highlight in my own mind,” Frampton explained. “I felt like I said, ‘I love yoga,’ and then it became the highlight, even though that’s just a fun thing I do on Saturday mornings. That was interesting, to kind of have that narrative chosen for me.”Other handpicked narratives include We McDonald’s experience with bullying, Janice Freeman’s life as a single mom and cancer survivor and Dylan Gerard’s decision to enter the medical field after his sister’s tragic car accident, all aiming to tug the heartstrings of viewers week by week.Frampton didn’t see herself as a children’s book author. Nor did she think she’d make it that far on the show. Her “sole intention” behind appearing on “The Voice” was to slip in Meg & Dia stories in hopes of getting the duo back on their feet after they spent all their savings on their 2011 album, “Cocoon.” “In the moment, we had been dropped from our label, we didn’t have a publicist, we didn’t have money, and I thought, ‘This is our publicity, possibly,’” she said. “But the band was never mentioned. I mean, I mentioned it, but it was never put on the show.” After Frampton finished second, she was picked up by Universal Republic to kick off a solo career. All the while, her sister Meg was left wondering what could’ve been. “Honestly, there was aftermath to that decision for years,” Dia said. “I think that last year was the first year I felt normal again with my sister, and that’s been a lot of work on our part... I still feel like I abandoned her in a way, and I struggle to deal with that in trying to be successful. I feel like sometimes I wish to not be successful so that I don’t do well and don’t abandon her again.” Following her season’s wrap, Dia and her new team whipped together an album in a few months, which she said was pushed on her by the label. ”I felt like the record was rushed to be put out,” she said of 2011’s “Red.” “I was so excited to work with so many different producers that I think I should’ve focused on working with one person who I really loved because the album kind of ended up being a crazy plethora of songs in all different genres.” Despite that, she insists her time on “The Voice” was a learning experience that led her to open for her coach Shelton and go on tour with James Blunt in China. According to Dia, she thought she’d found her stride when “Red” went double-platinum in parts of Southeast Asia, but shortly after a year of celebrity, she was back to the life of a struggling artist. Now she can’t even go out on tour because she fails to sell enough tickets or make enough money to promote her new album, “Bruises.” She’s currently working at a health food store, making minimum wage, while writing songs for other artists. “I look back at my time, not so much on ‘The Voice’ but post-‘Voice,’ because I felt like that was such a spike in my career and life... It felt like I was doing everything right and I was going to be OK and I was bearing on what I think was success, and then everything just kind of falls down,” she said, getting emotional. “That’s one thing you have to be prepared for as an artist. You have your ups and you have your downs, and your ups feel so amazing and your downs feel so difficult. And I feel like I am in a bit of a down right now. I feel like I’ve been throwing spaghetti at the wall for so long trying to make something hit, just kind of helping other artists get their voice out when I feel like mine is kind of going deeper and deeper into a hole.” There’s no sure way to determine why some artists soar after “The Voice” while others fall flat, but it appears a lot has to do with who’s in a contestant’s corner after they graduate from the show. For example, if talent isn’t thoroughly supported by Universal Music Group after a season ends, albums can go unproduced, unpromoted and unsold. Morrissey explained that, at its discretion, the pop-focused Republic Records chooses how many people it wants to pick up once the finale airs. Sometimes it partners with other labels, like Big Machine, if it thinks it’s not the best fit for a specific artist. “Pretty much all the winners are picked up,” Morrissey said. “There is choice amongst the label what they do with them, but we, as a television show, once they won, we’re not necessarily personally involved in their careers. We do everything in our power to prop them up, as we can, but that’s when it flips over to, really, the music business.”“When the baton is passed post-‘Voice,’ there’s some problems,” Levine told Howard Stern in 2015, suggesting that the label “fucks it up” because “no one knows what they’re doing.” He continued, “People take over after we do this great job of building these people up on the show. There’s some real issues there.”Season eight winner Sawyer Fredericks had an inconvenient experience shortly after being crowned “The Voice” in 2015. The now 18-year-old said he dropped Republic after his first album, “The Good Storm,” was released, over disagreements about his songwriting process. “It was kind of a mutual decision,” Fredericks told HuffPost, explaining that the label had him co-writing the record even though he wanted to pen his own lyrics. “I think it definitely changed my intent for a lot of songs.”For his sophomore album, “Hide Your Ghost,” the now independent singer-songwriter ― who lives on a farm with his family in upstate New York ― wants to take back control of his sound.“I wanted the freedom as full producer. Basically, whatever I say happens with the album, and I have the final word for everything... really conveying what I mean in my original work,” he explained.Fredericks is not the only “Voice” winner to go independent. After the label didn’t fully support his album “Come Through for You,” season one’s Javier Colon voluntarily moved on from Republic. Despite having catchy, potential hits like “Stand Up” (featuring Levine and co-written by Pharrell WIlliams), Colon’s music never got its due.“I went in with high hopes, as I believe everyone did,” Colon told Buddy TV in 2012. “But when you pour your heart and soul into a new album that you think is really great, and your label who is supposed to support, market and promote your music does neither, it’s really hard not to be upset.”Season 11’s Alisan Porter decided to part ways with Republic, too. The former child star (“Curly Sue,” “Parenthood”), now 36, initially took to Twitter to share the news that she was going independent.“It just wasn’t the right fit for me,” she told People earlier this year. “I have a really clear vision of who I am, and it might not be the most cookie-cutter commercial radio [vision]... I would much rather be true to myself than to do something that didn’t feel right for me.” Same goes for season five winner Tessanne Chin. Her debut album with Republic, “Count on My Love,” sold only 7,000 copies in its first week due to what she deems a lack of promotion. Now the 32-year-old Jamaican reggae-R&B singer is signed to the Justice League Music Group. She’s been performing frequently enough, but hasn’t seen the kind of success Pope and Bradbery have. See also: winners Jermaine Paul, Josh Kaufman, Craig Wayne Boyd and Sundance Head, who have yet to release albums with Republic Records, and perhaps never will.So, what gives? As more and more singing competition “winners” become “losers,” who’s at fault? And is there anything that can revive the once-sensational reality show dream?“You can’t blame a record company or management because, I think, in today’s day and age, you can ‘succeed’ and really take off without it because of the tools that are available to you independently,” Daly said. “A hit song is a hit song is a hit song, and I don’t care who sings it. You can ask Charlie Puth or Meghan Trainor; Fall Out Boy did this back in the day without any help from radio. If you have a hit song, it’s going to happen for you. It’s just a matter of time.” According to a Big Machine rep, it’s sometimes difficult to market “Voice” talent after the show, in part due to their network association. Because “The Voice” is on NBC, other companies, like CBS or ABC, won’t feature the show’s artists. “The networks are so competitive with one another that you need not only a label behind you, [but] you need to make sure the network is behind you and going to support you beyond you just being on their show,” the rep said. “If you’re stuck to only being able to do the ‘Today’ show or ‘Access Hollywood’ or another NBC platform, it’s limiting.” Morrissey says, record deal or not, “The Voice” tries to highlight former contestants whenever it can. Just this week, Alisan Porter was able to promote her Las Vegas show, “The Voice: Neon Dreams,” which is set to give artists, including Chris Mann (season two), Mary Sarah (season 10), Matthew Schuler (season five) and Matt McAndrew (season seven), a new platform, boosting their profiles once more. “The Voice” also recently highlighted past contestants’ journeys on the web-exclusive series “After The Voice.” “We do try to keep tabs on them. We do invite them back and have them perform on the show when they’re ready and they have music. To the best of our ability we push all of their work on all our socials. We try to do what we can,” Morrissey said. “It is what it is. We try our best.”Fredericks, for one, confirmed that “The Voice” producers have kept tabs on him and his career. “I don’t think it’s completely like I’m on my own. They’ve helped out quite a bit, and they’ve offered me to do stuff with the show,” he said. “It’s really fun to go back; it’s like a whole family. And it’s still going! This show, like everything, is just go, go, go.”The coaches are also a big part of the equation. Bradbery’s former mentor, Shelton, who she called “very genuine,” pays attention to the music she’s releasing. He congratulated her on a recent single, which Bradbery said he does as often as he can. “He definitely keeps everybody that’s been on his team under his wing, which I think is really amazing about him. What you see on TV of Blake is exactly what you’ll get. He’s not fake.” The same could be said about most of the coaches who attempt to stay in contact with their contestants after “The Voice,” Morrissey said. Levine has signed former artists to his record label, 222, while Keys continues to work and write with Blue.“Coaches go to a lot of lengths to help people keep growing far more than the public sees. We just don’t really have enough time or way on our show to illustrate that,” Morrissey said. “I’m just thinking about Christina [Aguilera] and Alisan Porter ― they’re still very close and work together. Miley [Cyrus], famously, my God, she keeps in touch with everybody, is texting constantly.”“It’s more than just a season to them or show or just a moment in time, but they really take on the artists as their own and really care about these individuals,” Blue told HuffPost.However, it’s not just the winning artists who take their shot in the ruthless world of music post-“Voice.” Throughout every season of the show, hundreds of contestants rotate in and out of the spotlight. Another famous reality show contestant is proof you don’t have to win to win: Jennifer Hudson. She is currently a coach on “The Voice,” but she placed seventh in the 2004 season of “American Idol.” She’s since won a Grammy for her album “Jennifer Hudson,” and Oscar, Golden Globe, British Academy Film and Screen Actors Guild awards for her role as Effie White in 2006’s “Dreamgirls.” Perhaps, with her experience, she can help guide her three eliminated live-show contestants, Davon Fleming, Shi’Ann Jones and Noah Mac, to mainstream success without a crown.“When she’s looking at them and saying, ‘I’ve been you. I’ve been right where you are. I know how to do this. I know how you’re feeling. I can help you navigate the waters once we’re successful.’ I mean, how do you not take somebody up on that offer? That’s valuable,” Daly said. “And having Kelly [Clarkson] on next season, too, will be the same thing.”In Clarkson’s mind, making your way to the top of the music charts after appearing on a singing competition show has a lot to do with perseverance. But, of course, luck plays a role, too. “The question is always, ‘Why does this one make it and why didn’t this one?’ And it’s hard to tell you that because I think if we knew the answer we’d bottle it up and sell it so everybody could make it,” Clarkson told HuffPost. “Jennifer Hudson and I had this talk when I worked with her recently. We were both like, ‘You know, it’s really not even winning.’ Like she’s the best example of that. It’s taking that opportunity, making something of it and being OK with the fact that it might not be exactly what you thought it was going to be.”We’ve seen that sort of attitude with “Voice” contestants like RaeLynn, who, at 23, is now one of the most sought-after songwriters in Nashville after being eliminated in the quarterfinals of season two. Her debut album, “Wildhorse,” hit No. 1 on Billboard’s Country Albums Chart and landed within the Top 10 on the All-Genre Album Sales Chart in 2017. This success, though, came after she left Big Machine and joined forces with Warner Music Nashville, which helped her sink into who she wanted to be as an artist. Under its guidance, she wrote “Love Triangle,” which garnered her a whole lot of attention for its raw and honest lyrics about being a child of divorce. “Within a week, I had so many other writers who wanted to write with me because of that song,” RaeLynn told Billboard. “It goes to show a great song is what can change a lot for you, and that’s what that song did for me.” RaeLynn credited Nashville as a pivotal environment. This might explain why a select few winners have flourished when they focused on Music City. “Everybody knows everybody, and when they find out there’s a new artist that’s great, everybody is going to support them,” she said. “They don’t just support artists who’ve already made it. They want to support new artists, and I think that’s so special.” And it seems country music listeners want to support emerging artists, as well. A source close to “The Voice” told HuffPost that voting during the show typically takes off in local markets when there’s a particularly moving performance. For example, when Sundance Head advanced in the competition, “The Voice” saw a huge spike in voters from Texas. “A lot of people who haven’t won the show [and are successful] are just people from Team Blake... He’s from that world and they take care of their own, no doubt about it,” Daly said, mentioning acts like RaeLynn, the Swon Brothers and Gwen Sebastian, who toured with Shelton and wrote three songs on Miranda Lambert’s latest critically acclaimed album, “The Weight of These Wings.”Ultimately, Clarkson believes no singing competition winner should ever feel like they’re automatically going to be a superstar with a dozen No. 1s. “That’s a level of entitlement that’s going to end up not really working out well,” she advised.“TV is so powerful, right? Use that platform and use that stage to really showcase what you have, and then use that opportunity to meet as many people as you can meet. That’s all we can really do because there’s no rhyme or reason to why some of us make it and some of us don’t. We all work hard. But some of it is the aligning of the stars.”Even with the ups and downs, most if not all of the contestants HuffPost spoke to had nothing but fond memories from their time on “The Voice,” and credited the show for giving them a place to shine.“I loved it as a learning experience, and I’m happy I did it,” Fredericks said. Bradbery and Blue expressed similar sentiments. “If it wasn’t for ‘The Voice,’ I’d be home doing regular stuff, so it was probably the biggest high moment of my whole entire life,” Bradbery said. “It’s been amazing.” “‘The Voice’ is a really great concept,” Frampton said. “At first, I honestly thought, ‘OK, this has to be rigged. Somebody has to tell the coaches to turn around for certain people.’ But going through the show and seeing the process, I truly believe that it is very genuine.”Despite the inconsistent track record, the hope for post-show success persists. “The Voice” is expected to continue running two cycles a year until ratings dip (which likely won’t happen anytime soon). Daly said that because there’s so much content out there, in order to stay relevant you have to be on top of your game. “There’s very little appointment viewing,” he said. “If you go away too long, you run the risk of just like falling into oblivion. There’s a successful Mark Burnett competition reality program [‘Survivor’] that’s been on twice a year on CBS for 35 seasons, and it works!”Daly and Morrissey also know their show is entertaining a robust audience and fills that feel-good void on TV. Because when it comes down to it, the winners of “The Voice” are the network, the coaches and, undoubtedly, the devoted fans who get to see a produced version of the American Dream play out before them. They might not be tuning in to vote for album sales or chart appearances, but they’re glued to their seats in anticipation of each season’s climax.Win or lose, prevailing after “The Voice,” like any other talent show, is the luck of the draw. But who knows? With a younger, more pop-rock-inspired crop of season 13 finalists (including Brooke Simpson, 26, Chloe Kohanski, 23, and Addison Agen, 16), the future winner could fare better. There’s still a country singer in the mix, though, ahead of next week’s finale, 40-year-old Red Marlow. Will a Tennessee crooner reign supreme once again? If we had to guess, we’d say yes.UPDATE: (Dec. 20) ― Rock-pop singer Chloe Kohanski was crowned Season 13′s “The Voice.” With that, her coach, Blake Shelton, secured his sixth win. Additional reporting by Lauren Moraski. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated the title of Stefani’s album. It is “This Is What the Truth Feels Like” not “What the Truth Feels Like.” It also incorrectly indicated Jordan Smith’s debut album was the best-selling album from the winner of any singing competition series in the last six years.

Recent ratings rival its debut season; this week, nearly 10 million people in the demographic of viewers ages 18-49 tuned in to watch the Top 8 perform, on par with numbers from season one.“Whatever the DNA is that’s making it successful, it just hasn’t changed,” the show’s host and executive producer, Carson Daly, told HuffPost. “It still feels like important, special, fresh, eventized, feel-good TV. All those early themes we wanted to roll out into the marketplace have stood as the pillar of what makes the show successful.” Those early themes Daly’s talking about center on one primary ideal: giving someone who’s been attempting to break into the music industry the opportunity of a lifetime. Singers of all shapes, sizes, ages, backgrounds, races and gender identities are provided the chance to perform in a blind audition on “The Voice,” during which four superstar coaches (not judges) sit with their backs to the stage, hoping to hear the next Whitney Houston, Justin Timberlake or Taylor Swift. From there, the contestants sing to an audience of at-home viewers eager to vote them into potential stardom. A $100,000 cash prize and a record deal with Republic Records, a subsidiary of Universal Music Group, or, in some cases, with pop and country label Big Machine is on the line. “Where else can you come on a show and sing and not be judged on anything but your talent, your voice?” the show’s executive producer Audrey Morrissey told HuffPost. “You’re in one-on-one tutoring with these people who are doing nothing but trying to shine a light on you and give you the fruits of all their experience in a very concentrated time to help you: to help you win the show, to help you win your career, to help you become a better artist. It’s literally priceless. Money can’t buy that.” Of course, the coaches on “The Voice,” the ones who sit in those massive red chairs that dramatically swivel around at the push of a button, have other motives beyond a desire to “shine a light” on fresh talent. “They’re making a lot of money, too, so don’t forget about that,” Daly joked.According to The Wrap, Blake Shelton and Adam Levine each make about $13 million a season. And the show not only gives unknown artists a platform but allows its star coaches one, as well. On primetime TV, they can expand their careers by flaunting family-friendly personalities and premiering new music. Before “The Voice,” for example, longtime coach Shelton had hit after hit on the country music charts with No. 1 songs like “Austin,” “Some Beach” and “All About Tonight.” But since his first stint on the show in 2011, his albums have gained mainstream appeal, with “Red River Blue” and “Bringing Back the Sunshine” both landing at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, at points surpassing the likes of Adele’s “21.”With all of its addictive goodness, you’d think the artists emerging from “The Voice” would also gain some momentum in the music business. However, the popularity of the show and its celebrity mentors doesn’t necessarily trickle down to the artists the network highlights for months on end. In truth, the show’s 12 winners have produced only five original Top 40 songs and earned one Grammy nomination from 2011 to now. And most of the winners’ singles that ranked on the Hot 100 were either “Voice” performances or original victory songs. Cassadee Pope and Danielle Bradbery are the only artists whose post-“Voice” singles have charted on the list.Unlike the coaches whose fame continues to flourish, it seems many “Voice” winners fare worse in the great expanses of the fair-weather music industry. The days of Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood ― who, after being crowned the champions of “American Idol” in 2002 and 2005, respectively, went on to earn a combined 10 Grammy Awards ― are gone. Today, “The Voice” might do everything in its power to make sure the viewers who vote are captivated by the show’s talent in-season. But once those artists are thrust into the music world, why do we rarely hear about them post-show?We do hear about some winners, like Jordan Smith, whose success was personally fostered by executive “Voice” producer Mark Burnett and his wife, Roma Downey. After flawlessly singing Sia’s “Chandelier” to an incredulous row of coaches on the show, he went on to nab three Top 40 hits and three No. 1s on the Hot Christian Songs chart. His first album, “Something Beautiful,” was a critical and commercial success story as it debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard chart in March 2016, right behind “Voice” coach Gwen Stefani’s “This Is What the Truth Feels Like.” Smith sold 54,000 units in the album’s first week, making making it one of the highest-ranking debuts of a singing competition series winner in the last several years. Nine months later, his holiday album, “’Tis the Season,” peaked at No. 11. He has been touring nationwide ever since. And then there’s Cassadee Pope, who signed to Big Machine after her win. (A source close to the company confirmed to HuffPost that Pope and the label decided to “mutually” part ways this year.) Now in the country domain, the former pop-punk singer has drawn comparisons to alternative vocalists like Avril Lavigne with her radio-primed voice. The season three champ has produced four Top 40 hits, two of those ― “Over You” and “Stupid Boy” ― being “Voice” performances. Her 2013 hit “Wasting All These Tears” landed at No. 37 and has been played more than 19 million times on Spotify. Her debut solo country record, “Frame by Frame,” also scored a No. 9 placement on the Billboard 200 and sold 43,000 copies in its first week. Just this year, Pope was nominated for a Grammy for best country duo/group performance for her song with Chris Young, “Think of You.”When asked who he thinks truly embodies a “Voice” success story, Daly cited the 28-year-old Florida native. “Cassadee was like a rocker chick in an all-boy band [Hey Monday], almost like Gwen in No Doubt, and she went on Team Blake and now I’ve seen her on red carpets and in Nashville,” he said.Another notable mention is season four winner Danielle Bradbery, who, although not a mainstream darling, has achieved success in the country music realm. The Houston native was 16 when she won the show and went on to release her self-titled debut album just five months later. Like Pope, Bradbery signed to Big Machine. “We knew she had a chance, and we definitely wanted her if she was going to win,” a Big Machine representative told HuffPost. “That was at the height, when media was just like, ‘The Voice, The Voice, The Voice!’”“They knew exactly what we needed to do as soon as I was off ‘The Voice,’ and so they flew me to Nashville and got an album cooking,” Bradbery told HuffPost of her experience with her management team. “Everything was really fast, but I knew they knew what they were doing... they had a plan. They got me on the ‘Today’ show right away, and are just big fans of getting the names and faces out there as much as possible and as fast as possible.” Bradbery’s 2013 single “The Heart of Dixie” peaked at No. 58 on the Hot 100 and performed decently on the Country chart. She toured with Brad Paisley and went on to produce an anthem for the promotional campaign of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi with “My Day.” Bradbery pushed forward with the release of her sophomore album, “I Don’t Believe We’ve Met,” on Dec. 1, and it’s currently No. 41 on the Billboard 200. Her lead single “Sway,” which features more pop-inspired undertones, was released in June and peaked at No. 19 on the Country Digital Songs Sales chart.“If I’m being honest, I didn’t know much about the whole other side of the music industry that you have to create for yourself and your teams... management, label, booking agents, everything along those lines,” she said. “It was definitely a learning experience every step of the way.”As it still is for season 12 winner Chris Blue. Instead of rushing forward with his debut album, the R&B singer from Knoxville, Tennessee, is working diligently with his former coach and now manager, Alicia Keys. “I watch Alicia and how she works, and she goes nonstop,” Blue told HuffPost. “After the show and putting in long hours every day, I realized, ‘Hey, this has to continue. This is now my lifestyle. You have to work hard in this business.’”Daly and Morrissey agree. They say “The Voice” is more of a boot camp than a superstar generator, so if people want to make it in the cutthroat entertainment industry, they’re expected to put their blood, sweat and tears into their own development. Winning, they insist, is hard work.In fact, the producers never wanted to mimic “Idol,” even if it “blazed a path” for them in the TV landscape, Daly said. “We didn’t really create the show to create a celebrity musician or make people rich and famous. That was never really the goal of the show. We are proud to say that so many of the artists who have been on ‘The Voice’ in any capacity have quit their sandwich-making jobs and are doing well in music. And at the end of the day that’s winning, to us.”But not every artist who’s deemed “The Voice” triumphs. For every Christian singer like Smith or country fave like Pope and Bradbery, you have a handful of “winners” who enjoy less of the sensation of a post-“Voice” career. Take, for example, season one runner-up Dia Frampton, who found some success in the early aughts alongside her sister in the indie-rock band Meg & Dia. During her time on “The Voice,” she said, the show, like many other reality programs, attempted to shape and mold its contestants’ stories to attract viewers, not necessarily lifelong fans. “I was introduced as the children’s book author, which was something I very lightly touched upon when we were doing interviews — that I liked writing children’s books, I liked blogging and writing stories. But that was definitely not the highlight in my own mind,” Frampton explained. “I felt like I said, ‘I love yoga,’ and then it became the highlight, even though that’s just a fun thing I do on Saturday mornings. That was interesting, to kind of have that narrative chosen for me.”Other handpicked narratives include We McDonald’s experience with bullying, Janice Freeman’s life as a single mom and cancer survivor and Dylan Gerard’s decision to enter the medical field after his sister’s tragic car accident, all aiming to tug the heartstrings of viewers week by week.Frampton didn’t see herself as a children’s book author. Nor did she think she’d make it that far on the show. Her “sole intention” behind appearing on “The Voice” was to slip in Meg & Dia stories in hopes of getting the duo back on their feet after they spent all their savings on their 2011 album, “Cocoon.” “In the moment, we had been dropped from our label, we didn’t have a publicist, we didn’t have money, and I thought, ‘This is our publicity, possibly,’” she said. “But the band was never mentioned. I mean, I mentioned it, but it was never put on the show.” After Frampton finished second, she was picked up by Universal Republic to kick off a solo career. All the while, her sister Meg was left wondering what could’ve been. “Honestly, there was aftermath to that decision for years,” Dia said. “I think that last year was the first year I felt normal again with my sister, and that’s been a lot of work on our part... I still feel like I abandoned her in a way, and I struggle to deal with that in trying to be successful. I feel like sometimes I wish to not be successful so that I don’t do well and don’t abandon her again.” Following her season’s wrap, Dia and her new team whipped together an album in a few months, which she said was pushed on her by the label. ”I felt like the record was rushed to be put out,” she said of 2011’s “Red.” “I was so excited to work with so many different producers that I think I should’ve focused on working with one person who I really loved because the album kind of ended up being a crazy plethora of songs in all different genres.” Despite that, she insists her time on “The Voice” was a learning experience that led her to open for her coach Shelton and go on tour with James Blunt in China. According to Dia, she thought she’d found her stride when “Red” went double-platinum in parts of Southeast Asia, but shortly after a year of celebrity, she was back to the life of a struggling artist. Now she can’t even go out on tour because she fails to sell enough tickets or make enough money to promote her new album, “Bruises.” She’s currently working at a health food store, making minimum wage, while writing songs for other artists. “I look back at my time, not so much on ‘The Voice’ but post-‘Voice,’ because I felt like that was such a spike in my career and life... It felt like I was doing everything right and I was going to be OK and I was bearing on what I think was success, and then everything just kind of falls down,” she said, getting emotional. “That’s one thing you have to be prepared for as an artist. You have your ups and you have your downs, and your ups feel so amazing and your downs feel so difficult. And I feel like I am in a bit of a down right now. I feel like I’ve been throwing spaghetti at the wall for so long trying to make something hit, just kind of helping other artists get their voice out when I feel like mine is kind of going deeper and deeper into a hole.” There’s no sure way to determine why some artists soar after “The Voice” while others fall flat, but it appears a lot has to do with who’s in a contestant’s corner after they graduate from the show. For example, if talent isn’t thoroughly supported by Universal Music Group after a season ends, albums can go unproduced, unpromoted and unsold. Morrissey explained that, at its discretion, the pop-focused Republic Records chooses how many people it wants to pick up once the finale airs. Sometimes it partners with other labels, like Big Machine, if it thinks it’s not the best fit for a specific artist. “Pretty much all the winners are picked up,” Morrissey said. “There is choice amongst the label what they do with them, but we, as a television show, once they won, we’re not necessarily personally involved in their careers. We do everything in our power to prop them up, as we can, but that’s when it flips over to, really, the music business.”“When the baton is passed post-‘Voice,’ there’s some problems,” Levine told Howard Stern in 2015, suggesting that the label “fucks it up” because “no one knows what they’re doing.” He continued, “People take over after we do this great job of building these people up on the show. There’s some real issues there.”Season eight winner Sawyer Fredericks had an inconvenient experience shortly after being crowned “The Voice” in 2015. The now 18-year-old said he dropped Republic after his first album, “The Good Storm,” was released, over disagreements about his songwriting process. “It was kind of a mutual decision,” Fredericks told HuffPost, explaining that the label had him co-writing the record even though he wanted to pen his own lyrics. “I think it definitely changed my intent for a lot of songs.”For his sophomore album, “Hide Your Ghost,” the now independent singer-songwriter ― who lives on a farm with his family in upstate New York ― wants to take back control of his sound.“I wanted the freedom as full producer. Basically, whatever I say happens with the album, and I have the final word for everything... really conveying what I mean in my original work,” he explained.Fredericks is not the only “Voice” winner to go independent. After the label didn’t fully support his album “Come Through for You,” season one’s Javier Colon voluntarily moved on from Republic. Despite having catchy, potential hits like “Stand Up” (featuring Levine and co-written by Pharrell WIlliams), Colon’s music never got its due.“I went in with high hopes, as I believe everyone did,” Colon told Buddy TV in 2012. “But when you pour your heart and soul into a new album that you think is really great, and your label who is supposed to support, market and promote your music does neither, it’s really hard not to be upset.”Season 11’s Alisan Porter decided to part ways with Republic, too. The former child star (“Curly Sue,” “Parenthood”), now 36, initially took to Twitter to share the news that she was going independent.“It just wasn’t the right fit for me,” she told People earlier this year. “I have a really clear vision of who I am, and it might not be the most cookie-cutter commercial radio [vision]... I would much rather be true to myself than to do something that didn’t feel right for me.” Same goes for season five winner Tessanne Chin. Her debut album with Republic, “Count on My Love,” sold only 7,000 copies in its first week due to what she deems a lack of promotion. Now the 32-year-old Jamaican reggae-R&B singer is signed to the Justice League Music Group. She’s been performing frequently enough, but hasn’t seen the kind of success Pope and Bradbery have. See also: winners Jermaine Paul, Josh Kaufman, Craig Wayne Boyd and Sundance Head, who have yet to release albums with Republic Records, and perhaps never will.So, what gives? As more and more singing competition “winners” become “losers,” who’s at fault? And is there anything that can revive the once-sensational reality show dream?“You can’t blame a record company or management because, I think, in today’s day and age, you can ‘succeed’ and really take off without it because of the tools that are available to you independently,” Daly said. “A hit song is a hit song is a hit song, and I don’t care who sings it. You can ask Charlie Puth or Meghan Trainor; Fall Out Boy did this back in the day without any help from radio. If you have a hit song, it’s going to happen for you. It’s just a matter of time.” According to a Big Machine rep, it’s sometimes difficult to market “Voice” talent after the show, in part due to their network association. Because “The Voice” is on NBC, other companies, like CBS or ABC, won’t feature the show’s artists. “The networks are so competitive with one another that you need not only a label behind you, [but] you need to make sure the network is behind you and going to support you beyond you just being on their show,” the rep said. “If you’re stuck to only being able to do the ‘Today’ show or ‘Access Hollywood’ or another NBC platform, it’s limiting.” Morrissey says, record deal or not, “The Voice” tries to highlight former contestants whenever it can. Just this week, Alisan Porter was able to promote her Las Vegas show, “The Voice: Neon Dreams,” which is set to give artists, including Chris Mann (season two), Mary Sarah (season 10), Matthew Schuler (season five) and Matt McAndrew (season seven), a new platform, boosting their profiles once more. “The Voice” also recently highlighted past contestants’ journeys on the web-exclusive series “After The Voice.” “We do try to keep tabs on them. We do invite them back and have them perform on the show when they’re ready and they have music. To the best of our ability we push all of their work on all our socials. We try to do what we can,” Morrissey said. “It is what it is. We try our best.”Fredericks, for one, confirmed that “The Voice” producers have kept tabs on him and his career. “I don’t think it’s completely like I’m on my own. They’ve helped out quite a bit, and they’ve offered me to do stuff with the show,” he said. “It’s really fun to go back; it’s like a whole family. And it’s still going! This show, like everything, is just go, go, go.”The coaches are also a big part of the equation. Bradbery’s former mentor, Shelton, who she called “very genuine,” pays attention to the music she’s releasing. He congratulated her on a recent single, which Bradbery said he does as often as he can. “He definitely keeps everybody that’s been on his team under his wing, which I think is really amazing about him. What you see on TV of Blake is exactly what you’ll get. He’s not fake.” The same could be said about most of the coaches who attempt to stay in contact with their contestants after “The Voice,” Morrissey said. Levine has signed former artists to his record label, 222, while Keys continues to work and write with Blue.“Coaches go to a lot of lengths to help people keep growing far more than the public sees. We just don’t really have enough time or way on our show to illustrate that,” Morrissey said. “I’m just thinking about Christina [Aguilera] and Alisan Porter ― they’re still very close and work together. Miley [Cyrus], famously, my God, she keeps in touch with everybody, is texting constantly.”“It’s more than just a season to them or show or just a moment in time, but they really take on the artists as their own and really care about these individuals,” Blue told HuffPost.However, it’s not just the winning artists who take their shot in the ruthless world of music post-“Voice.” Throughout every season of the show, hundreds of contestants rotate in and out of the spotlight. Another famous reality show contestant is proof you don’t have to win to win: Jennifer Hudson. She is currently a coach on “The Voice,” but she placed seventh in the 2004 season of “American Idol.” She’s since won a Grammy for her album “Jennifer Hudson,” and Oscar, Golden Globe, British Academy Film and Screen Actors Guild awards for her role as Effie White in 2006’s “Dreamgirls.” Perhaps, with her experience, she can help guide her three eliminated live-show contestants, Davon Fleming, Shi’Ann Jones and Noah Mac, to mainstream success without a crown.“When she’s looking at them and saying, ‘I’ve been you. I’ve been right where you are. I know how to do this. I know how you’re feeling. I can help you navigate the waters once we’re successful.’ I mean, how do you not take somebody up on that offer? That’s valuable,” Daly said. “And having Kelly [Clarkson] on next season, too, will be the same thing.”In Clarkson’s mind, making your way to the top of the music charts after appearing on a singing competition show has a lot to do with perseverance. But, of course, luck plays a role, too. “The question is always, ‘Why does this one make it and why didn’t this one?’ And it’s hard to tell you that because I think if we knew the answer we’d bottle it up and sell it so everybody could make it,” Clarkson told HuffPost. “Jennifer Hudson and I had this talk when I worked with her recently. We were both like, ‘You know, it’s really not even winning.’ Like she’s the best example of that. It’s taking that opportunity, making something of it and being OK with the fact that it might not be exactly what you thought it was going to be.”We’ve seen that sort of attitude with “Voice” contestants like RaeLynn, who, at 23, is now one of the most sought-after songwriters in Nashville after being eliminated in the quarterfinals of season two. Her debut album, “Wildhorse,” hit No. 1 on Billboard’s Country Albums Chart and landed within the Top 10 on the All-Genre Album Sales Chart in 2017. This success, though, came after she left Big Machine and joined forces with Warner Music Nashville, which helped her sink into who she wanted to be as an artist. Under its guidance, she wrote “Love Triangle,” which garnered her a whole lot of attention for its raw and honest lyrics about being a child of divorce. “Within a week, I had so many other writers who wanted to write with me because of that song,” RaeLynn told Billboard. “It goes to show a great song is what can change a lot for you, and that’s what that song did for me.” RaeLynn credited Nashville as a pivotal environment. This might explain why a select few winners have flourished when they focused on Music City. “Everybody knows everybody, and when they find out there’s a new artist that’s great, everybody is going to support them,” she said. “They don’t just support artists who’ve already made it. They want to support new artists, and I think that’s so special.” And it seems country music listeners want to support emerging artists, as well. A source close to “The Voice” told HuffPost that voting during the show typically takes off in local markets when there’s a particularly moving performance. For example, when Sundance Head advanced in the competition, “The Voice” saw a huge spike in voters from Texas. “A lot of people who haven’t won the show [and are successful] are just people from Team Blake... He’s from that world and they take care of their own, no doubt about it,” Daly said, mentioning acts like RaeLynn, the Swon Brothers and Gwen Sebastian, who toured with Shelton and wrote three songs on Miranda Lambert’s latest critically acclaimed album, “The Weight of These Wings.”Ultimately, Clarkson believes no singing competition winner should ever feel like they’re automatically going to be a superstar with a dozen No. 1s. “That’s a level of entitlement that’s going to end up not really working out well,” she advised.“TV is so powerful, right? Use that platform and use that stage to really showcase what you have, and then use that opportunity to meet as many people as you can meet. That’s all we can really do because there’s no rhyme or reason to why some of us make it and some of us don’t. We all work hard. But some of it is the aligning of the stars.”Even with the ups and downs, most if not all of the contestants HuffPost spoke to had nothing but fond memories from their time on “The Voice,” and credited the show for giving them a place to shine.“I loved it as a learning experience, and I’m happy I did it,” Fredericks said. Bradbery and Blue expressed similar sentiments. “If it wasn’t for ‘The Voice,’ I’d be home doing regular stuff, so it was probably the biggest high moment of my whole entire life,” Bradbery said. “It’s been amazing.” “‘The Voice’ is a really great concept,” Frampton said. “At first, I honestly thought, ‘OK, this has to be rigged. Somebody has to tell the coaches to turn around for certain people.’ But going through the show and seeing the process, I truly believe that it is very genuine.”Despite the inconsistent track record, the hope for post-show success persists. “The Voice” is expected to continue running two cycles a year until ratings dip (which likely won’t happen anytime soon). Daly said that because there’s so much content out there, in order to stay relevant you have to be on top of your game. “There’s very little appointment viewing,” he said. “If you go away too long, you run the risk of just like falling into oblivion. There’s a successful Mark Burnett competition reality program [‘Survivor’] that’s been on twice a year on CBS for 35 seasons, and it works!”Daly and Morrissey also know their show is entertaining a robust audience and fills that feel-good void on TV. Because when it comes down to it, the winners of “The Voice” are the network, the coaches and, undoubtedly, the devoted fans who get to see a produced version of the American Dream play out before them. They might not be tuning in to vote for album sales or chart appearances, but they’re glued to their seats in anticipation of each season’s climax.Win or lose, prevailing after “The Voice,” like any other talent show, is the luck of the draw. But who knows? With a younger, more pop-rock-inspired crop of season 13 finalists (including Brooke Simpson, 26, Chloe Kohanski, 23, and Addison Agen, 16), the future winner could fare better. There’s still a country singer in the mix, though, ahead of next week’s finale, 40-year-old Red Marlow. Will a Tennessee crooner reign supreme once again? If we had to guess, we’d say yes.UPDATE: (Dec. 20) ― Rock-pop singer Chloe Kohanski was crowned Season 13′s “The Voice.” With that, her coach, Blake Shelton, secured his sixth win. Additional reporting by Lauren Moraski. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated the title of Stefani’s album. It is “This Is What the Truth Feels Like” not “What the Truth Feels Like.” It also incorrectly indicated Jordan Smith’s debut album was the best-selling album from the winner of any singing competition series in the last six years.

43,GREEN,When The Fire Comes And There's No Home To Evacuate And Nowhere To Go,Antonia Blumberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/california-thomas-fire-homeless_us_5a3408a6e4b0ff955ad29a0f,How the Thomas fire is affecting an already vulnerable homeless community.,2017-12-16,The Thomas fire was still burning in the hills south of Santa Barbara on Friday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a342d1d1600002100c503df.jpeg?cache=6hc9THdZYA&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In some parts of Santa Barbara County, the Thomas fire has caused apocalyptic scenes. Ash is everywhere, the air is smoky and there’s a persistent pink haze to the light that is like a constant dusk.The Thomas fire erupted Dec. 4 and has been scorching Santa Barbara and Ventura counties since. The fierce blaze, rare for a December, has torn through 250,000 acres of land, destroyed 700 homes and killed at least two people, including a firefighter who died battling the monstrous flames. But among the invisible victims of the fire are hundreds of homeless men and women living in the area. While the fires have been burning in the surrounding foothills, the effects on the streets of Santa Barbara are dramatic.“There’s ash blanketing everything. It looks like a snowfall,” the Rev. Julia Hamilton, head minister of the Unitarian Society of Santa Barbara, told HuffPost on Thursday. “Imagine lying down to sleep in the middle of this toxic ash. There’s nowhere to go.” An estimated 1,500 people in Santa Barbara County live on the street or in shelters, according to a 2017 report by the Central Coast Collaborative on Homelessness, although the true number may be higher. For some of those already living outdoors, the health effects have been dramatic, aid workers say. A primary issue is the air quality. Public health officials warned in past days that, because of the smoke and ash, monitoring stations in the area recorded high levels of fine particulates in the air. They cautioned vulnerable groups, including children and seniors, to remain indoors. “But what if someone doesn’t have an indoors?” Hamilton noted. “There’s no respite for them from the air quality.” Maria Long, a clinical psychologist and executive director of Santa Barbara Street Medicine, an organization that provides medical care to people experiencing homelessness, said people on the streets are already feeling the effects.“People who have a history of asthma or weak lung capacity and respiration conditions are experiencing flare-ups. It’s harder to breathe. They’re getting headaches and eye irritation,” Long told HuffPost. In the past days, Long’s team has been walking the streets with medications, seeking out anyone who may need medical care.Many homeless people suffer from health problems, from the wear and tear of life on the street and from the difficulty of getting medical care for conditions any of us could have. Roughly a third of homeless individuals in the city report having a disability.Many of the homeless individuals whom aid organizations have served in the past days are seniors with medical conditions. Aid organizations have worked hard in the past days to provide extra shelter for those that need it, but for those who are still sleeping on the streets or can’t stay in shelters during the day, their best bet to avoid inhaling too much smoke is to wear a mask.Emily Allen, who directs veteran and homeless services at Northern Santa Barbara United Way, said much of her team’s work in the past two weeks has been distributing masks to people on the streets, some of whom she said have been resistant to wearing them. On Wednesday, for instance, the sky was deceptively blue. On a day like that, Allen said, “people may be less likely to wear the mask or seek indoor shelter.”Long echoed the challenge of communicating the masks’ necessity. “People in shelters didn’t take the fire seriously the first day.” Some thought people would be less likely to give money to them with their faces covered. “But now they’re wearing masks, and they’re scared.” Some homeless men and women have also lost what they call home, said Rick Raine, who works with the Ojai Valley Family Shelter and Catholic Charities in Ventura County. Raine said he’d encountered individuals who had been living in the forested areas that have now been swallowed up by the fire. “That’s what they called home, and their homes and all their belongings burned,” Raine said. Where displaced residents have evacuated to the homes of friends and family, or even quit town entirely, the homeless can’t.“They couldn’t evacuate. They were stuck here.” Organizations across the county are pulling together to help homeless people cope. The Unitarian Society has opened its “warming center” in downtown Santa Barbara early this year to help get people off the streets and out of the “oppressive” smoke and ash. They continue to shelter roughly 40 to 50 guests per night. PATH, another local shelter that typically operates a 100-bed facility for people transitioning out of homelessness, opened up an emergency shelter on Dec. 5 to help get people out of the bad air and ash.In addition to the warming centers and PATH, there are several other shelters in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties, including the Ojai Valley Family Shelter.But many of those providing services to the area’s unsheltered communities said there’s simply a shortage of beds for those who need them, partly because one of the largest shelters in the city is being renovated.The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection reported Friday that the Thomas fire was just 35 percent contained, and multiple evacuation orders were still in place in parts of Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. But even after the fire is fully contained, the ash will remain, and the homeless populations may face long-term challenges.“Everything they have with them ― their packs, their clothes ― everything gets infiltrated with this ash. Everything they own will need to be cleaned,” Hamilton said.And reflecting on those who will continue to sleep outdoors, she added: “I look around and think, how are we going to get the ash off the sidewalks and out of the street? It’s going to be a long time before we can say that it’s cleaned up.” "

Adam Schiff Warns Of GOP Plans To Shutter House's Russia Probe,Carla Herreria,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rep-adam-schiff-gop-to-shut-down-russia-investigation_us_5a34491ce4b0ff955ad2fe3e,"The top Democrat is ""increasingly worried"" of Republicans' attempts to close the inquiry into Russia's election meddling.",2017-12-16,House Intelligence Committee ranking member Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.).,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a3457dd1600000f12cf1864.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee may be looking to prematurely shutter the committee’s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, a ranking Democrat warned Friday.In a series of tweets, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) explained why he was becoming “increasingly worried” that the probe may be nearing a conclusion as soon as the end of December.Schiff, who is working on the probe, said that Republicans on the committee have not issued any subpoenas or scheduled any further witness interviews past next Friday. The inaction, he added, comes at a time when the panel has made “important progress” in the nine months of the investigation, which has involved interviewing key witnesses and uncovering new leads.“We have dozens of outstanding witnesses on key aspects of our investigation that they refuse to contact and many document requests they continue to sit on,” Schiff wrote.“It appears Republicans want to conduct just enough interviews to give the impression of a serious investigation,” he added.Schiff’s warning mirrors a report from The New York Times published Friday suggesting that the House Intelligence Committee is rushing to finish the investigation before Congress breaks for the holidays.According to the Times report, some of the panel’s most important witnesses will be interviewed in New York next week, potentially forcing some House Democrats to choose between voting on the GOP’s controversial tax bill and attending depositions for the Russian investigation. Schiff said the witnesses were willing to travel to the capital.In his tweets, Schiff added that the House will also have to vote on “vital government funding bills” as well. The time crunch could mean that “no Members will be able to ask questions,” he wrote.All this, Schiff said, would be “in an effort to squeeze them in before end of year.”Asked about the push to end the investigation, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), who is leading the House probe on Russia, told The New York Times, “I feel no need to apologize for concluding an investigation.”Schiff also pointed to recent “attacks” by Republicans on special counsel Robert Mueller and the FBI as evidence that the GOP politicians were working to end the Russia investigation “aggressively and soon.”Republicans have taken aim at Mueller’s investigation into Russia this week after reports revealed that the FBI removed Peter Strzok, a top agent, from the probe. Strzok was found sending text messages that could be seen as critical of President Donald Trump.During an oversight hearing of the House Judiciary Committee earlier this week, Republicans suggested that the public could no longer trust Mueller and the Justice Department to conduct an unbiased investigation, according to NBC News.“I think the public trust in this whole thing is gone,” Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said Wednesday.Similarly, Trump cast doubt on the FBI’s efficacy earlier this month when he tweeted that the bureau’s reputation was “in tatters” and “the worst in history” under former director James Comey. On Friday, the president told reporters that “people are very, very angry” with the FBI and the Justice Department ahead of his trip to the FBI National Academy in Quantico, Virginia.In his tweets, Schiff warned the public that attacks on the Justice Department by Republicans and the White House are simply attempts to derail the Russia probe.“We cannot let that happen,” the Democrat said."
45,POLITICS,Progressive Groups Want Doug Jones To Throw Caution To The Wind,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/progressive-groups-alabama-democrat-doug-jones_us_5a3557a9e4b0ff955ad36422,"If the Alabama Democrat loses his re-election bid in 2020, it won’t be because he was too liberal, activists say.",2017-12-16,"Senator-elect Doug Jones (D-Ala.) speaks to reporters on Dec. 13, 2017, the day after his upset victory in a special election for an open U.S. Senate seat.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a3558881500001f0049c0e1.jpeg?cache=jkhkFt23sU&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Through a unique confluence of events, Democrat Doug Jones managed to defy the deeply Republican leanings of Alabama and win a special election on Tuesday to represent the state in the Senate.But without an alleged child predator like Republican Roy Moore on the ticket in 2020, Jones will almost certainly have an uphill climb to re-election.Still, the national progressive groups that raised money for Jones and marshaled volunteers on his behalf insist that his best route to a second term is to embrace populist policies and stick to core liberal convictions, rather than blazing the kind of cautious, moderate path more typical of red-state Democrats.“The best way for Doug Jones to hold the seat is to legislate as a bold populist to fight for kitchen-table issues, fight for more money in people’s pockets,” said Kaitlin Sweeney, a spokeswoman for the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which raised about $40,000 for Jones. “We could see him be a leader in issues that transcend partisan politics ― expanding health care to every American, making education funding fair, ensuring a living wage ― issues that could resonate with Democratic voters in Selma and Republican voters in Mobile.”At the same time, Sweeney added, “Nobody is expecting him to come in and govern like a Jeff Merkley [D-Ore.] or an Elizabeth Warren [D-Mass.].”But progressive leaders fear that Jones will instead heed the emerging chorus of pundits counseling him to emulate Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and other red-state Democratic lawmakers, whose conservatism ― even on economic policy ― is a sore point on the left.Jones “should not follow the advice of D.C. insiders who tell him that he should be doing the bidding of corporations, telling him that he should be trying to find the middle ground, that he should be a Republican-lite or even worse a racist-lite,” said Charles Chamberlain, executive director of Democracy for America, which raised $75,000 for Jones and mobilized its 12,000 Alabamian members to phone-bank and canvass for Jones. “He needs to fight for inclusive populist policies.”At its core, these organizations’ advice for Jones, while self-validating, gets to the heart of a debate about how Democrats can win in challenging territory. Many in the party’s left wing have long maintained that a focus on delivering tangible economic benefits will both excite base voters and win over independents and Republicans in the most conservative areas. The 2016 loss of Hillary Clinton, who struggled at times to craft a compelling economic narrative and dispel perceptions of undue coziness with financial elites, has only made them more confident in their argument. “Yes, a Democrat winning in Alabama is an anomaly in current modern, political speak,” Chamberlain said. “But that’s the reality only because Democrats continually don’t run on their values, they continually don’t run on inclusive populist ideas that are universally popular, accepted and actually impact everyone including Republicans.”DFA pointed to a 2014 poll it commissioned with PCCC and other groups showing majority support for expanding Social Security in solidly Republican Texas and Kentucky.“I am confident that Republicans in Alabama are no different,” Chamberlain said.And even if Jones does not buy an electoral pitch for populism, Chamberlain added, he would do well to embrace the moral urgency of the moment ― come what may at the ballot box. “The bottom line is that we’re in a situation right now where we are fighting the most corrupt, corporate president in the history of America who is willing to do anything, say anything to divide the country in as many ways as he possibly can,” Chamberlain said. “With that lens on it, if I were Doug Jones, I might very possibly say, ‘This is my YOLO moment. I’m gonna do whatever it takes to deliver the highest amount of change as possible in my limited time in Congress.’”Some policies where DFA, PCCC and their allies believe Jones has the best chance of pushing a progressive agenda with crossover appeal are expanding Social Security, raising the minimum wage, protecting voting rights ― and even expanding public health care.Rather than embrace single-payer health care ― or “Medicare for all,” as progressives have dubbed it ― Sweeney suggested that Jones could advocate a Medicare buy-in for the entire population.“Medicare is one of those programs that’s popular all across the country, including red states like Alabama,” she said. “A way to bring people along on Medicare for all is allow people to buy into the program and see what it’s like.”The way Jones ― best known for his work as a U.S. attorney convicting the Ku Klux Klan members responsible for the deadly 1963 bombing of a Birmingham, Alabama, church ― ran his campaign has given liberals reason for optimism.Jones pleased many observers by eschewing the social conservatism that characterized white Southern Democrats of previous decades. He is a strong supporter of abortion rights, LGBTQ rights, criminal justice reform and policies to limit climate change, which he acknowledges is a grave, man-made threat.Jones also describes health care as a “right,” backing “improvement” of the Affordable Care Act over repeal. He has said he is open to the possibility of a “public option” for health insurance that might resemble the Medicare buy-in mentioned by PCCC.In his victory speech Tuesday night, Jones called on Congress to immediately renew funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which provides coverage to low- and moderate-income kids who don’t qualify for Medicaid. (Sixteen states are due to run out of the funds needed to keep the program running by the end of January, if Congress fails to act.)But Jones is already on the brink of disappointing activists who want him to wade into last-minute attempts to thwart the Republican tax bill.Murshed Zaheed, political director of Credo Mobile, a progressive phone company with an online network of 5 million activists, asked Jones to join Democratic leaders in calling for the GOP to delay a vote on the massive tax bill until Jones is seated in the Senate. “This is his first test,” Zaheed said. “He needs to speak out now. That’s gonna tell us a lot about how he is going to represent Alabamians over the next three years.”Thus far, Jones has shown no such willingness to speak out on the matter. Referring to the timing of when he is seated in the Senate, Jones told the popular liberal podcast “Pod Save America” that “we’ve still got a process in Alabama that we have to go though.”And Jones appears most comfortable speaking about his desire to project a more sophisticated view of lawmakers from the Deep South by dint of his liberal stances on social issues and openness to bipartisan cooperation. “Unfortunately, [Attorney General Jeff] Sessions’s voice is what people think of when they think of the typical Southern politician,” Jones told The Washington Post. “And that’s not true at all. I want to have the bully pulpit to challenge those views in public all the time.”At the same time, Jones told the Post that he won based on a focus on “kitchen table” economic issues.There is indeed some evidence to support this idea. In addition to sending some 100,000 text messages to nudge moderate-propensity Democrats to turn out for Jones, the Working Families Party tested about 25 digital ads in more conservative rural counties outside the city of Huntsville in northern Alabama. The ads that elicited the most interest from voters, according to WFP spokesman Joe Dinkin, framed the election as a choice between two sharply divergent economic visions. “Roy Moore wants to take away your health care while cutting taxes for billionaires,” one of the successful digital ads declared.Governing as an advocate for a higher minimum wage and greater health care access is likely to have crossover appeal for the same reason, Dinkin posited.Jones “represents a pretty poor state,” Dinkin said. “There is political upside and moral necessity in him embracing a progressive agenda.”"
46,POLITICS,A Republican Running To Replace Paul Ryan Comes With White Nationalist Street Cred,Christopher Mathias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-nehlen-white-nationalism-roy-moore-republican-party_us_5a30471de4b07ff75afe6ffd,"Wisconsin Republican Paul Nehlen, who stumped for Roy Moore in Alabama, makes himself at home on a fascist podcast and tosses bigoted bombs on Twitter.",2017-12-16,"Paul Nehlen, right, is introduced at a ""Drain the Swamp"" Roy Moore campaign event in Midland City, Alabama, on Monday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a318144150000490049b831.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"HuffPost asked Paul Nehlen three times by email this week if he considers himself a white nationalist. Twice Nehlen dodged the question. The third time he didn’t respond.The Wisconsin Republican is running to replace House Speaker Paul Ryan, who might not be seeking re-election. Nehlen campaigned in Alabama recently for Roy Moore, the Senate nominee accused of sexual misconduct, who suffered a historic defeat Tuesday. Nehlen claims to have raised “six figures” for the Moore campaign.Nehlen was a speaker Monday at Moore’s campaign rally in Midland City, Alabama. He took the stage wearing the red “Make America great again” cap and warned the crowd that “we’re engaged in a spiritual battle.” Moore was the only one, he said, who could “drain that swamp” up in D.C. Only two days earlier, on Dec. 9, Nehlen was a guest on an anti-Semitic white power podcast called “Fash the Nation,” talking to hosts “Jazzhands McFeels” and “Marcus Halberstram” for about an hour. (“Fash” is shorthand among the so-called alt-right, a loose association of white nationalists, for “fascist.”)It was Nehlen’s second appearance on the show, and his fluency with white nationalist jargon was evident as he made thinly veiled anti-Semitic remarks and proudly recounted having told a Jewish magazine editor to “eat a bullet.”On Dec. 8, Nehlen used Gab, a micro-blogging platform used primarily by white nationalists, to repost a drawing another user had made for him. The drawing showed a puny Ryan, seen as the anti-Trump, next to a buff “Chad” Nehlen. (Chad is an alt-right term for a fit alpha-male womanizer.) In the accompanying text, Nehlen is described as having “redpilled on globalism, RR and JQ.”“Redpilled,” a reference to the Matrix movie trilogy, is used to describe an awakening to white supremacist teachings. “RR” stands for “race realism,” and “JQ” stands for the “Jewish question,” the anti-Semitic conspiracy theory that Jews have undue influence over the media, banking and politics that must somehow be addressed. Earlier this month, Nehlen tweeted “It’s okay to be white,” a meme that originated on the message board 4chan, a haven for neo-Nazi trolls, and was spread enthusiastically by white nationalists. “In fact it’s pretty awesome,” he added in a follow-up tweet.On at least two occasions this month, Nehlen has retweeted racist memes shared by Mark Collett, a British Nazi sympathizer.On the night of Aug. 11, when neo-Nazis and other assorted racists marched with tiki torches through Charlottesville, Virginia, Nehlen retweeted an image of the march posted by white nationalist Jason Kessler: “Incredible moment for white people who’ve had it up to here & aren’t going to take it anymore. Tomorrow we #UnitetheRight #Charlottesville.”After Moore’s defeat in Alabama, Nehlen shared another piece of fan art Wednesday that was created for him on Gab. It showed Roman centurions with “Pepe the Frog” heads. (Pepe the Frog is the mascot of the white nationalists.) “I call on all ready and able #GabFam to run for #House and #Senate and to vote for fellow #GabFam like @pnehlen in 2018,” read the text. HuffPost emailed Nehlen on Wednesday detailing some of these — and other — flirtations he’s made with being an avowed white nationalist. Asked if he considers himself either a white nationalist or a member of the alt-right, Nehlen largely dodged the question, sending the following statement:I’m a successful businessman and have had something like 20,000 employees around the globe of every color, race, and creed; not to mention patented inventions so attempts to paint me as anything but a successful businessman reflect on the media’s identity politics not my Christian faith. Besides ― it’s true that it’s okay to be white ― it’s pretty awesome in fact.Asked in a follow-up email to clarify whether or not he’s a white nationalist with a simple yes or no, Nehlen responded:Given that the media is still determined to libel all conservatives as bigots, it seems some clarity on the definition of American Nationalism ― the idea that the United States should put the economic and security interests of American citizens ahead of the economic and security interests of illegal aliens and non-citizens ― is in order. In a third email Thursday, HuffPost noted that this was a definition of nationalism, but that it didn’t answer the question as to whether Nehlen considers himself a white nationalist or a member of the alt-right. He didn’t respond.Nehlen’s association with the Moore campaign, which received funding from the Republican National Committee and was endorsed by President Donald Trump, shows that a faction of the GOP appears to be at ease with white nationalists in its ranks.At the Moore campaign rally Monday he attended, Moore’s wife defended her husband from accusations of anti-Semitism by saying that one of his attorneys is a Jew. (An investigation by The Forward failed to find this Jewish lawyer.)It also shows that Steve Bannon’s effort to publicly distance himself from the alt-right is a ruse. Bannon, the Breitbart News executive chairman and a former White House chief strategist, had championed Moore and is backing Nehlen.Nehlen told HuffPost that Bannon is a “friend.” On the “Fash the Nation” podcast, Nehlen said Bannon considers him a “kamikaze” against the GOP establishment. Bannon did not respond to a request for comment on Nehlen’s white nationalist sentiments. Neither did the Moore campaign. Nor did the National Republican Congressional Committee. Nehlen has been comfortable expressing bigoted comments in public for a while now, as documented by the Angry White Men blog run by Twitter user @EyesOnTheRight. Earlier this month, during a Twitter spat with Richard Lawler, an editor at tech news site Engadget who is black, Nehlen tweeted, “Run along Tyrone.” As @EyesOnTheRight wrote, “There are two ways to interpret that comment, both of which suggest Nehlen was making a racist remark. On the one hand, Nehlen used a stereotypically black name to refer to an African-American man whose name he clearly knew. On the other, ‘Tyrone’ is a reference to a racist joke popular on the alt-right.”That “joke” features a deeply racist cartoon rendering of a black man, which we won’t republish here. On the “Fash the Nation” podcast last weekend, Nehlen recounted another Twitter spat he’d had, this one with John Podhoretz, the conservative editor of Commentary magazine. After an argument over gun control, Nehlen had tweeted to Podhoretz, who is Jewish, that he should “self-deport” and “eat a bullet.” “So Bannon’s catamite @pnehlen has, in the past 12 hours, suggested I commit suicide and called on me, born and raised in the U.S. but Jewish, to ‘self-deport,’” Podhoretz tweeted. “Catamite” is an obscure word referring to a young boy kept by a pederast. “What race even has that word?” Nehlen asked on “Fash the Nation.” “Well, there’s one.”The hosts laughed. McFeels called it a “very biblical term,” emphasizing again Podheretz’s religious heritage.“If people watch you stand in the face of the people like [the] John Podhoretzes of the world, the people who want to throw their parentheses at you — I have no time for that,” Nehlen said. “I’m not afraid of those guys.”“Parentheses” is a reference to the anti-Semitic “echo” gimmick, in which the names of Jews or Jewish institutions are placed in triple parentheses. Nehlen was suspended from Twitter for 12 hours for telling Podhoretz to “eat a bullet.” He told the “Fash the Nation” hosts that he “got shoah’d for 12 hours.”“Shoah” is a Hebrew word for “calamity,” used most commonly to refer to the Holocaust. For white nationalists, though, it’s used as a slur, reserved for small inconveniences — like getting suspended by Twitter — as a way of diminishing the horror of the Holocaust. Nehlen also bragged that his fans had listened to his first appearance on “Fash the Nation” and that the “the redpills are being shot at people like with bump fire stocks.” (Translation: He’s converting a lot of his supporters into white nationalists.) At another point, Nehlen and the hosts talked gushingly about a recent stunt by the white nationalist group Identity Evropa, whose members joined the violent “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville this summer. In March, Identity Evropa hung a giant banner from a highway overpass in Georgia that read “America first. End immigration now.” The group tweeted out a photo, which Nehlen retweeted.The “Fash the Nation” hosts were deeply flattered that Nehlen was a guest on their show. McFeels — who, it should be noted, has appeared on the radio show of David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard, and has called for the creation of a “white ethno-state” — lashed out at Paul Ryan for taking money from Jewish “paymasters” and promised to “make sure” Nehlen wins his congressional race in Wisconsin. Nehlen replied that he was “honored” to be on the show. “You guys do great, great work,” he said. "

""Please send flowers.""",2017-12-16,Actress Alyssa Milano put Matt Damon in his place after his convoluted statement on sexual misconduct accusations.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a34881c1600004700c5049f.jpeg?cache=615I1FEQX3&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Actress Alyssa Milano taught a master class on the problems of sexual misconduct Friday night. Her student? Matt Damon.Damon raised more than a few eyebrows this week when he suggested that sexual harassment and sexual assault “shouldn’t be conflated,” then gave examples of how he and others should handle different levels of sexual misbehavior in an ABC News interview.“I do believe that there’s a spectrum of behavior,” Damon said in the interview. “And we’re going to have to figure out — you know, there’s a difference between, you know, patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation, right? Both of those behaviors need to be confronted and eradicated without question, but they shouldn’t be conflated, right?”“It’s the micro that makes the macro,” Milano wrote in a tweet addressed to the Oscar-winning actor.“We are in a ‘culture of outrage’ because the magnitude of rage is, in fact, overtly outrageous,” she added. “And it is righteous.”Milano helped get the #MeToo movement trending on social media in October after film mogul Harvey Weinstein was publicly accused of being a serial sexual abuser. Sharing the #MeToo hashtag would help show the world how common sexual assault and harassment are, the actress said at the time. “We might give people a sense of the magnitude of the problem,” she tweeted.Now directing her attention to Damon, Milano shared that she has been a victim of sexual harassment, assault and all notches across the spectrum Damon had suggested.“They all hurt,” Milano tweeted Friday night. “And they are all connected to a patriarchy intertwined with normalized, accepted ― even welcomed ― misogyny.”She then expressed the deeper reasons why survivors of assault and harassment are so incensed over the entire spectrum of sexual misconduct: They have long been “gaslighted” and “silenced.”“We are not outraged because someone grabbed our asses in a picture. We are outraged because we were made to feel this was normal,” Milano wrote. “We are outraged because we have been gaslighted. We are outraged because we were silenced for so long.”Milano likened Damon’s so-called spectrum of misconduct to the different stages of cancer. Though some stages of cancer are more treatable than others, they’re all cancer, Milano explained. The tumor, however, is now being cut out, she concluded.“Sexual harassment, misconduct, assault and violence is a systemic disease,” Milano wrote. “The tumor is being cut out right now with no anesthesia. Please send flowers.”"

But, according to one of her closest friends Todrick Hall, who’s essentially become our best source for inside info during this no-interview era, she’s actually “very sensitive” to criticism. “We were talking about this the other day and I was like, ‘It blows my mind that you’re so humble and so sensitive,’” Hall said during an interview on “The Kid Kraddick Morning Show.” “We were hanging out at her house and Tiffany Haddish was there and she was saying something about some comment a kid said, and you could tell that it made Taylor’s entire energy shift because she just loves people so much and she wants everybody to understand where she’s coming from.”But then why does she make it so easy? Just this week, Swift said she “couldn’t have asked for a better year,” which, of course, galvanized the internet to remind her all of the actually terrible things that have gone down in 2017. “I think it’s that passion and that humble quality about her that makes her so great at writing songs that people identify with because she wears her heart on her sleeve,” Hall added. “When things happen, it really, really gets to her.” Hall says that now she’s the “happiest I’ve ever seen her” with new boyfriend Joe Alwyn, but the sailing hasn’t always been so smooth. Although he doesn’t name any names, the singer mentions that he didn’t exactly approve of one of Swift’s former flames. “There was a time last year — I don’t know if I’m supposed to say anything — she was dating someone,” Hall said. “I’d actually never met this person, but I could just tell every time I would talk to her, she would hunch over.”“I sent her this picture of her as Quasimodo that I edited,” he recalled. “Because I was like, ‘You cannot turn into Quasimodo for this guy. Every time you say his name, you hunch over.’”Given the timeline, he could be talking about actor Tom Hiddleston, whom Swift dated for a couple months in 2016. As E! noted, Hall likely met Swift’s other recent ex-boyfriend, DJ Calvin Harris, when he joined the pop star at one of his concerts.“She’s so happy. Standing up completely straight and so tall and so confident. I just love it,” Hall added. “I’m so, so happy for her and I cannot wait to see this tour.”"

Fortunately for Bean and Erivo – not to mention listeners accounting for nearly 650,000 YouTube views to date ― it has been.“People’s reaction is beyond anything I could ever... both Cynthia and I are like, ‘What is happening?!’” confessed Bean on Podomatic’s No. 1 LGBTQ Podcast. “We thought it was cool but not this cool!”Fans of The Great White Way are likely familiar with both women. In 2005, Bean stepped into Idina Menzel’s shoes playing Elphaba in the Broadway production of Wicked, reprising the role a year later for the company’s first national tour. Erivo won “Best Actress in a Musical” at the 2016 Tony Award as Celie in The Color Purple.Backed only by Kiara Perico on viola and cellist April Guthrie, their voices meld beautifully for the smoldering take on an album track from current Swift opus Revenge. Ryan Parma’s video captivates, calling to mind the nonplussed female guitarists in the iconic music video for Robert Palmer’s ’80s hit “Addicted to Love.” Cooed Bean: “Yes, you got it!”Whether for its visuals or the powerhouse vocals – likely a combination of the two – “I Did Something Bad” has become a viral sensation. Media outlets from Billboard Magazine to Entertainment Tonight, Elle to Broadway staple Playbill have heaped praise on the rendering.Even Swift herself took notice, sharing the link to her nearly 86 million Twitter followers. Bean called the experience “crazy,” especially given the “Look What You Made Me Do” star’s recent step away from social media for the release of the new album.“My friend, in the morning, was like, ‘What if Taylor sees it?’” she shared a conversation from Dec. 1, when the video went live. “I was like, ‘She’s never going to see it.’ Then I woke up from a nap four hours later to a retweet!”Despite several friends close to the mega-star — like choreographer, fellow Broadway star and RuPaul’s Drag Race judge Todrick Hall — how Swift discovered their version is still a mystery, Bean says. The tweet, though, eased some concern. She shared: “You never know if you’re going to offend someone.”WATCH: Shoshana Bean & Cynthia Erivo Slay“I love seeing my songs covered by other people, how they reimagine and reinvent,” stated Bean, “So I would always hope it would have the same affect on [Taylor], that she would enjoy it, respect it, be flattered. I don’t know. I just love the song.”In fact, one article cites Bean saying “I Did Something Bad” was “love at first listen.” The singer used the podcast as an opportunity to “slightly retract” the earlier statement.“Nothing of Taylor’s is ever ‘love at first listen’ for me,” confessed Bean, a guest performer last summer at TrevorLIVE New York 2017, a signature fundraising event supporting the Trevor Project’s LGBTQ-focused suicide prevention resources and crisis intervention services. “Taylor is like an earworm,” she continued. “I always go through and am like, ‘Nah, I’m not into it!’ Then something will bring me back to it.”In this instance, Bean was in Hawaii, preparing to hit the treadmill. Knowing “if for nothing else, it’s going to give me a great beat,” she turned on Revenge. “All of a sudden,” the singer recalled, “I was like, ‘Holy shit! This is a great album!’”Her ears really perked up, Bean said, when Swift sang, “You’ve got to leave before you get left.” Before her workout finished, the track was on repeat with the genesis for her cover forming. According to the singer, whose next solo album Spectrum is set for release February 2018, she never considered of her rendition a “huge reimagining” of the original. Though hailed as such by many, Bean simply honed in on the lyrical mention of “violins” and peeled back layers of production and “sonic elements” Swift is dabbling in on the new record.“Sometimes that can overshadow what’s just a good song on its own,” said Bean, pointing to the success of her cover as proof the track “can stand on its own with just a couple violins or just a piano or just a guitar.” That, she says, “is the magic of Taylor Swift in the first place. “She’s a great songwriter. No one can dispute that,” she concluded, “When you strip away all the bells and whistles, that’s what’s there — and I think that’s all we really did, just strip away the bells and whistles.”Visit Shoshana Bean’s Website.Follow Party Foul Radio on Twitter.“Like” Party Foul Radio on Facebook.LISTEN: Shoshana Bean Talks LGBTQ Fans, Taylor Swift Cover, Broadway"

We’ll see what happens,” Trump told reporters Friday on his way to Marine One, before speaking at the FBI National Academy graduation. “Let’s see, I can say this: When you look at what’s gone on with the FBI and the Justice Department, people are very, very angry.”Flynn pleaded guilty earlier this month to lying to the FBI about his communications with the Russian government.On Friday afternoon, White House attorney Ty Cobb told CNN: “There is no consideration being given to pardoning Michael Flynn at the White House.” In his Friday comments, Trump referenced messages critical of the president that were sent between an FBI lawyer and an agent who later worked for special counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. They caused “anger,” the president said.“It’s a shame what’s happened with the FBI, but, we’re going to rebuild the FBI, it’ll be bigger and better than ever,” Trump said. “But it is very sad, when you look at those documents and how they’ve done that is really, really disgraceful and you have a lot of angry people who are seeing it.”“The level of anger at what they’ve been witnessing with respect to the FBI is certainly very sad,” Trump added.Earlier Friday, deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley told Fox News “there is extreme bias against this president” with high-ranking officials at the FBI.Trump again called Mueller’s investigation into Russia and his campaign a “hoax.”“There is absolutely no collusion, that has been proven,” Trump claimed, arguing even his “worst enemies” say there was no collusion between his campaign and Russia.“I didn’t make a phone call to Russia. I have nothing to do with Russia. Everybody knows it,” Trump said. “That was a Democrat hoax. It was an excuse for losing the election. And it should have never been this way ... so now even the Democrats admit there’s no collusion. There is no collusion. That’s it.”In addition to Flynn, former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians during the campaign. Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, two top Trump campaign staffers, were also charged as part of Mueller’s investigation.This story has been updated with more details and background and with comment from Ty Cobb."

But he trafficked in emails stolen by a foreign adversary and went to the Oval Office instead.Now, with the White House trying to downplay links between the president’s campaign and Russian officials, there still remains the biggest unanswered question about the election: Why did Trump enthusiastically praise WikiLeaks on the stump at a time he had access to classified analyses stating that the group was essentially an arm of Russian intelligence?“There was general intelligence community consensus by August 2016 ― indeed long before ― that WikiLeaks was functioning as a cut-out for Russian intelligence,” said John Schindler, a former analyst with the National Security Agency and onetime counterintelligence officer.“Among Russia experts, that was a pretty obvious conclusion,” said Tom Nichols, a Russia scholar at the U.S. Naval War College, who called WikiLeaks a “wholly owned subsidiary” of the Russian spy agencies. “You didn’t need the intelligence community to tell you this. This was common sense.”Even before Trump took office in January, questions arose about the numerous links between his campaign and Russian officials. Prosecutors working for special counsel Robert Mueller and congressional committees are reportedly investigating whether campaign officials sought out cooperation with Russia or accepted offers of cooperation. Among the areas under scrutiny: whether the campaign secretly helped Russian “trolls” target specific voters with propaganda attacking the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, in misleading Facebook ads and fake news stories.Yet out in the open and indisputable the entire time was Trump’s daily praise of WikiLeaks in the final weeks of the campaign, starting right after the Oct. 7 release of the “Access Hollywood” tape that seemed capable of sinking his candidacy. That tape contained his boast that he could grab women by the genitals because of his celebrity. WikiLeaks began releasing a new batch of damaging-to-Democrats emails within an hour after the tape story broke, and Trump began talking up those emails in his campaign speeches days later.“WikiLeaks! I love WikiLeaks,” Trump proclaimed at a Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, rally on Oct. 10, 2016.“You see so much from these WikiLeaks,” he told a Panama City, Florida, audience the next day.“This WikiLeaks stuff is unbelievable,” he said the following day at an Ocala, Florida, rally. “You’ve got to read it!”In total, Trump referred to WikiLeaks by name 137 times in public appearances and media interviews between Oct. 10 and Election Day, according to PolitiFact. There were another two dozen times when he referred to the emails but did not name the entity.During that whole time, Trump had access to U.S. intelligence stating that WikiLeaks was acting as an agent of Russian spy agencies, which had stolen the material from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and the Democratic National Committee.Trump and his top aides began receiving periodic briefings from U.S. intelligence officials on Aug. 17, 2016. Intelligence officials do not publicly disclose the contents of such briefings, but NBC News reported a year ago that the Russian hack was part of the planned briefing material. In any event, Trump and his aides had the opportunity to ask the briefers about the material and how it came into WikiLeaks’ hands.“Any counterintelligence briefer by August 2016 should have more than suspected that WikiLeaks and the Russians were cooperating ― and should not have shied away from saying so, if asked about it,” Schindler said.HuffPost posed questions to the White House about whether candidate Trump sought to learn about WikiLeaks in any of his intelligence briefings or whether the campaign notified the FBI about the approaches it was receiving from Russian officials ― including some to Trump’s oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., from WikiLeaks itself.Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who had also been a press aide with the Trump campaign, referred those questions to one of the outside lawyers representing the president in the Russia investigation, John Dowd. And Dowd did not want to discuss the matter. “I can’t help you. And even if I could, I wouldn’t,” he said. “It’s all nonsense. So I’m not going to waste any of my time or your time.”His “nonsense” description mirrors Trump’s oft-stated claim that the entire Russia investigation is a “hoax” invented by Democrats to explain away Clinton’s loss.That view, though, is undercut by the nation’s intelligence agencies, which on Jan. 6, 2017, released a declassified version of a longer analysis stating that Russian intelligence agencies hacked the emails from the DNC and Podesta and that Russian President Vladimir Putin was actively trying to help Trump win. It further details the numerous links between Russia and WikiLeaks, including the latter’s relationship with the RT television network, which is basically a Russian propaganda agency.The ties between the self-described “transparency” group and Russia did not begin with the 2016 campaign, said Nichols, the Naval War College expert on that country.

After releasing thousands, perhaps millions, of classified documents to journalists, the NSA contractor fled to Hong Kong. From there, he made his way to Moscow ― accompanied by a top official from WikiLeaks. The group had negotiated his transit. “None of that can happen without a Russian hand behind it,” Nichols said.“Its pivotal role in the defection of Edward Snowden to Moscow in June 2013 demonstrated to anyone familiar with counterintelligence that WikiLeaks had some sort of clandestine relationship with the Kremlin,” Schindler said.WikiLeaks, of course, is not the only Russia-related link to the Trump campaign, nor even the first. Details that have emerged in the past year show contacts going back before the Indiana primary in May 2016, when Trump effectively secured the Republican nomination.Campaign adviser George Papadopoulos met with a suspected Russian intelligence liaison in Italy and London in March 2016, receiving offers of “dirt” on Clinton and the possibility of arranging a meeting between Putin and Trump. Papadopoulos has since pleaded guilty in Mueller’s investigation and is cooperating with investigators. (Trump’s defenders have dismissed Papadopoulos as an unimportant campaign volunteer, even though he attended the only meeting of Trump’s national security team in April 2016.)Top Trump campaign aide Michael Flynn ― who also served briefly as the president’s first national security adviser and recently pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Russian officials ― had deep ties to Russia. He’d even attended a dinner with Putin in Moscow to honor RT’s 10th anniversary on the air.Following revelations of the DNC hacking and suspicions about Russian involvement, Trump said at a July 27, 2016, press conference that the news did not bother him at all. In fact, he encouraged Russian hackers to break into Clinton’s computers directly to find the emails that she had deleted from a private server she had used as secretary of state. “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,” Trump said.He later said he was kidding about that request, but nevertheless, through the remainder of his campaign and much of the transition, he continued to deny that it was possible for anyone to know who had hacked the DNC emails. Only in January, shortly after the release of the U.S. intelligence analysis and days before taking office, did Trump concede that the culprit had been Russia.

But he trafficked in emails stolen by a foreign adversary and went to the Oval Office instead.Now, with the White House trying to downplay links between the president’s campaign and Russian officials, there still remains the biggest unanswered question about the election: Why did Trump enthusiastically praise WikiLeaks on the stump at a time he had access to classified analyses stating that the group was essentially an arm of Russian intelligence?“There was general intelligence community consensus by August 2016 ― indeed long before ― that WikiLeaks was functioning as a cut-out for Russian intelligence,” said John Schindler, a former analyst with the National Security Agency and onetime counterintelligence officer.“Among Russia experts, that was a pretty obvious conclusion,” said Tom Nichols, a Russia scholar at the U.S. Naval War College, who called WikiLeaks a “wholly owned subsidiary” of the Russian spy agencies. “You didn’t need the intelligence community to tell you this.

However deep it goes, we will remove it from Interior.”The same day, the agency released the results of a Work Environment Survey it conducted from January to March of this year. It determined that 35 percent of its 70,000 employees had experienced harassment or discrimination in the 12 months leading up to the survey. A total of 8 percent of staffers reported sexual harassment, 20.5 percent reported age-related harassment, 16.5 percent reported gender-based harassment and 9.3 percent reported race- or ethnicity-based harassment. Fewer than 36 percent of survey respondents who filed a complaint or report said some kind of action had been taken. Almost 40 percent were told to drop the issue.“Under my leadership we don’t protect predators,” Zinke said in a statement. “When I say ‘zero tolerance’ I mean that these people will be held accountable for their abhorrent actions.”The agency didn’t name any of the staffers it fired, but it points to this not being the first time it’s had to deal with the issue. Tim Lynn, a former senior law enforcement official with the department, retired in May after an investigation determined that he had sexually harassed six women he worked with.The department added that it’s now drafting a new harassment policy, which will include a mandatory reporting process for allegations.The survey comes on the heels of a March report that detailed the pernicious work environment for women within Yellowstone National Park. Employees of the U.S. Forest Service, National Park Service, and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department have long complained of sexual harassment without much hope of a culture change. "

As a result, it will be harder for unions and workers to file complaints against fast-food chains or other big companies that rely on franchisees and contractors to oversee work.The two Democratic members dissented.Earlier this year, McDonald’s was put on trial as a potential joint employer so that it might be held responsible for violating the rights of workers employed by its franchisees. That case has not been ruled on yet, and the change in precedent Thursday could knock a hole in the workers’ argument.While business groups cheered the policy change, labor groups and Democrats condemned it as a setback for worker rights. “This shocking and brazen decision to overturn pro-worker precedent is further proof the Trump Administration will stop at nothing to line the pockets of corporations — no matter what price workers and their families are forced to pay,” Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate’s labor committee, said in a statement after the ruling.The NLRB is an independent agency that referees disputes between employers and unions, though the policies it sets affect all private-sector workers, whether they’re in unions or not. Trump recently filled two vacancies on the board with Republican picks, flipping the board from liberal to conservative for the first time in eight years.The board under President Barack Obama issued a number of decisions that enraged employer groups, the joint employer ruling chief among them. The then-liberal majority said that companies shouldn’t be able to dodge their responsibilities to workers by using subcontractors or franchisees. If a company at the top of the contracting chain exerts control over the working conditions at the bottom, they reasoned, then it should qualify as an employer.The ruling Thursday reverts to an older standard for joint employment that makes it harder to hold the company at the top accountable.The National Restaurant Association, a leading industry lobby, said Thursday that it “applauds” the new ruling. “Today’s decision restores years of established law and brings back clarity for restaurants and small businesses across the country.”"
58,WORLD NEWS,It's Hard To Know Exactly What's Happening To Myanmar's Rohingya.

The profile picture that came with his Facebook message request showed two armed men holding guns. “Hello,” was all he wrote.According to his profile, we had no mutual friends, didn’t attend the same schools or live in the same city, but I responded with a “hello” in turn and asked how he found me.Writing in poor English, Royal said he was a Rohingya student living in Myanmar’s western Rakhine state. The Rohingya are a predominantly Muslim ethnic group whose members have lived in Rakhine state for centuries. Most of Myanmar’s Buddhist majority population considers the Rohingya to be immigrants, and in 1982, the government stripped them of citizenship ― effectively rendering them stateless and limiting their access to jobs, medical care and education. The Rohingya have faced decades of persecution at the hands of Myanmar’s military and Buddhist hardliners. Tensions escalated dramatically in August after a small group of Rohingya extremists, known as the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, attacked police and army posts in the state. Buddhist militants retaliated by burning down villages, arresting and torturing men, raping women and killing children. Since then, more than 624,000 of the 1.1 million Rohingya in Rakhine have fled to neighboring Bangladesh. It’s unclear how many Rohingya exactly remain in Rakhine, but the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre in Geneva estimates that more than 300,000 are in desperate need of aid. Royal said he was one of the Rohingya who remained behind, and explained that he’d found me while searching Facebook for aid workers. “I resherch donation worker at them i got ur facebook,” he wrote. I’m a freelance journalist, which my Facebook page clearly states. But since I have been closely following recent news reports about worsening violence against the Rohingya, his messages piqued my interest. I received another Facebook request a few hours later from a man named Kyawwinnaing. He, too, introduced himself as a Rohingya student living in Rakhine. “Our villagers [are] very very poor and I need your help,” he wrote.The next morning, there was another one. Ro Kyaw Tun Naing said he was a schoolteacher in one of the remaining Rohingya villages, and had been one of Kyawwinnaing’s teachers. He also said he works for a local humanitarian agency. His English, albeit choppy, was sufficient to maintain a conversation. I asked what was happening in his village. “Facing .Arrsted.Raping .burning .on rohingya pepole in Rakhine state now.I am find .My family are safe,” he replied.I wanted to know more ― whether these men were who they claimed to be, and if they were, why they were contacting a freelance journalist based in Seattle. Reporting from Rakhine is thin at best, since the military bars access to journalists and has only let a few relief agencies in. These exchanges sent me on a reporting quest that has given me a digital window into life in Rakhine state, and it has become increasingly clear that the Rohingya are looking for social media users in other countries to share their stories with the rest of the world.None of the men who contacted me are using their real names online, out of fear that public postings under their Rohingya names would make them government targets. Kyaw Tun Naing says he has already been arrested once for using Facebook to share news about the Rohingya, and he’s haunted by the idea that this could happen again. Other Rohingya activists have reported online harassment and have even received death threats over the phone. I now know their real identities, but am withholding that information to protect their safety.In our ongoing correspondence, the three men painted a grim picture of the situation in Rakhine. I’ve woken up to messages containing images and videos of Rohingya villages being torched at night by the military, operating under the cover of darkness. “Breaking news,” Royal would write, before sending over a media file and a description of an event. They say Myanmar’s army has continued to raid Rohingya villages and set fire to abandoned homes, even after Bangladesh and Myanmar signed an agreement on Nov. 23 to allow hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees to return home. They have sent images purporting to document crimes by Myanmar’s army since violence broke out at the end of August — photos of Rohingya men and women who had been beaten, shot or raped. The messages also suggest that Rohingya villages lack access to basic necessities like food and medicine. Early on, Royal sent me photos that he said showed villagers selling their home goods to buy food and medicine in a nearby town. He claimed a video showed a Rohingya man with cancer who had sold all his possessions to pay for surgery, only to be dropped by the doctor when he could no longer pay.These traumatic images are impossible to verify and extremely graphic, and are not included here for those reasons. But they have left me wondering whether the Rohingya who have fled will ever feel safe again in Rakhine. According to the men, Rohingya still abandon their villages out of fear each day. Kyaw Tun Naing told me that Rohingya are leaving his village on a daily basis, hoping to find food and jobs in Bangladesh. Kyaw Tun Naing himself refuses to go. He fears living in Bangladesh as a refugee would be even more difficult than staying in Myanmar. Kyawwinnaing, too, doesn’t want to leave. “I am Rohingya. I am not Bengali,” he explained, adding that he hopes more relief agencies will eventually gain access to Rakhine.  Facebook has become a breeding ground for fake news in Myanmar ever since violence intensified over the summer. The social media platform is so prevalent in the country that some people believe it is the internet. Myanmar’s government and military deny the reports about atrocities in Rakhine ― even civilian leader and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has been on the defensive, dismissing them as “misinformation.”Some government accounts have taken advantage of Facebook’s reach to push that line in a seemingly coordinated effort, claiming that the Rohingya are burning down their own villages or distributing photos of soldiers’ bodies that were actually taken during other conflicts.Kyaw Tun Naing said those government reports prompted him to reach out after he joined Facebook in September. “Myanmar media [do not] write true news,” he told me. “Rohingya people don’t have journalist. And Rakhine state [has] no free media.”While Royal, Kyawwinnaing and Kyaw Tun Naing say they can not move freely from village to village, $3 can buy them 2 gigabytes of data to use on their mobile phones to keep abreast of news and be in touch with other Rohingya living in Rakhine or outside of the country. They share photos, videos and news among themselves before they pass the message on.Without eyes on the ground in Rakhine, I knew I wouldn’t be able to fully verify their accounts, but I did everything I could to confirm their identities. One of my trusted Rohingya sources spoke with Royal and confirmed his identity. I tried verifying Kyaw Tun Naing’s involvement with the humanitarian agency, but my email to the group’s main branch in Yangon bounced back as undeliverable.While I asked the men to send photos from their villages and their day-to-day lives, they often just sent me any photos they had. I ran each one through a reverse image search, and some appeared to be originals. For example, there were no perfect matches for a photo of a bullet wound on a man’s back, confirming that this image wasn’t already published elsewhere, and Google’s reverse image search’s best guess for the location of the image was “Rakhine state.” In other instances, multiple people sent me the same photo, suggesting that those images are circulating among Rohingya activists connected on Facebook. Ro Kyaw Tun Naing sent me a handful of those, including photos that appeared to show the arrest of two men. I recognized the men’s faces from a Rohingya activist’s Twitter post; they were reportedly attacked by extremists in a village in northern Rakhine state. Even though I’ve grown to believe and trust these men and their stories, I can’t be completely sure they are who they say they are. One thing is clear, however: No matter how many probing questions I’ve asked, the men have not grown tired of them.Corresponding with these Rohingya men in the past few weeks has brought a different sense of routine to my life. I’ve grown used to the ping of my WhatsApp and the chirp of my Messenger notifications in the morning and late afternoons. I feel relieved when read receipts on my Messenger conversations or blue check marks on the WhatsApp chats appear, indicating that they are still safe, and alive. It has also raised new questions for me about working on stories about conflict-ridden countries. As journalists, we are encouraged to be objective in our reporting, to not meddle in the lives of people that we cover. But seeing these photos and videos and forming relationships with these men elicits in me the very human response of wanting to help. To me, the greatest paradox of the use of social media in the Rohingya crisis is that complete strangers can tell me about their plight, but there’s no way for me to help directly. Yet, in a different context, anyone can start a crowdfunding campaign to help defray medical costs, and a stranger sympathetic to their situation could donate money directly toward that. In the last few weeks, I’ve marveled at how democratizing the internet can be. For the Rohingya, it offers freedom from reality. They can read about the international community’s response to the crisis and can connect with family and friends displaced by violence. A Facebook friend request, if accepted, gives them the ability to live vicariously through a stranger — a stranger who coincidentally has the privilege to help shed light on their stories."

Ro Kyaw Tun Naing said he was a schoolteacher in one of the remaining Rohingya villages, and had been one of Kyawwinnaing’s teachers. He also said he works for a local humanitarian agency. His English, albeit choppy, was sufficient to maintain a conversation. I asked what was happening in his village. “Facing .Arrsted.Raping .burning .on rohingya pepole in Rakhine state now.I am find .My family are safe,” he replied.I wanted to know more ― whether these men were who they claimed to be, and if they were, why they were contacting a freelance journalist based in Seattle. Reporting from Rakhine is thin at best, since the military bars access to journalists and has only let a few relief agencies in. These exchanges sent me on a reporting quest that has given me a digital window into life in Rakhine state, and it has become increasingly clear that the Rohingya are looking for social media users in other countries to share their stories with the rest of the world.None of the men who contacted me are using their real names online, out of fear that public postings under their Rohingya names would make them government targets. Kyaw Tun Naing says he has already been arrested once for using Facebook to share news about the Rohingya, and he’s haunted by the idea that this could happen again. Other Rohingya activists have reported online harassment and have even received death threats over the phone. I now know their real identities, but am withholding that information to protect their safety.In our ongoing correspondence, the three men painted a grim picture of the situation in Rakhine. I’ve woken up to messages containing images and videos of Rohingya villages being torched at night by the military, operating under the cover of darkness. “Breaking news,” Royal would write, before sending over a media file and a description of an event. They say Myanmar’s army has continued to raid Rohingya villages and set fire to abandoned homes, even after Bangladesh and Myanmar signed an agreement on Nov. 23 to allow hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees to return home. They have sent images purporting to document crimes by Myanmar’s army since violence broke out at the end of August — photos of Rohingya men and women who had been beaten, shot or raped. The messages also suggest that Rohingya villages lack access to basic necessities like food and medicine. Early on, Royal sent me photos that he said showed villagers selling their home goods to buy food and medicine in a nearby town. He claimed a video showed a Rohingya man with cancer who had sold all his possessions to pay for surgery, only to be dropped by the doctor when he could no longer pay.These traumatic images are impossible to verify and extremely graphic, and are not included here for those reasons. But they have left me wondering whether the Rohingya who have fled will ever feel safe again in Rakhine. According to the men, Rohingya still abandon their villages out of fear each day. Kyaw Tun Naing told me that Rohingya are leaving his village on a daily basis, hoping to find food and jobs in Bangladesh. Kyaw Tun Naing himself refuses to go. He fears living in Bangladesh as a refugee would be even more difficult than staying in Myanmar. Kyawwinnaing, too, doesn’t want to leave. “I am Rohingya. I am not Bengali,” he explained, adding that he hopes more relief agencies will eventually gain access to Rakhine.  Facebook has become a breeding ground for fake news in Myanmar ever since violence intensified over the summer. The social media platform is so prevalent in the country that some people believe it is the internet. Myanmar’s government and military deny the reports about atrocities in Rakhine ― even civilian leader and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has been on the defensive, dismissing them as “misinformation.”Some government accounts have taken advantage of Facebook’s reach to push that line in a seemingly coordinated effort, claiming that the Rohingya are burning down their own villages or distributing photos of soldiers’ bodies that were actually taken during other conflicts.Kyaw Tun Naing said those government reports prompted him to reach out after he joined Facebook in September. “Myanmar media [do not] write true news,” he told me. “Rohingya people don’t have journalist. And Rakhine state [has] no free media.”While Royal, Kyawwinnaing and Kyaw Tun Naing say they can not move freely from village to village, $3 can buy them 2 gigabytes of data to use on their mobile phones to keep abreast of news and be in touch with other Rohingya living in Rakhine or outside of the country. They share photos, videos and news among themselves before they pass the message on.Without eyes on the ground in Rakhine, I knew I wouldn’t be able to fully verify their accounts, but I did everything I could to confirm their identities. One of my trusted Rohingya sources spoke with Royal and confirmed his identity. I tried verifying Kyaw Tun Naing’s involvement with the humanitarian agency, but my email to the group’s main branch in Yangon bounced back as undeliverable.While I asked the men to send photos from their villages and their day-to-day lives, they often just sent me any photos they had. I ran each one through a reverse image search, and some appeared to be originals. For example, there were no perfect matches for a photo of a bullet wound on a man’s back, confirming that this image wasn’t already published elsewhere, and Google’s reverse image search’s best guess for the location of the image was “Rakhine state.” In other instances, multiple people sent me the same photo, suggesting that those images are circulating among Rohingya activists connected on Facebook. Ro Kyaw Tun Naing sent me a handful of those, including photos that appeared to show the arrest of two men. I recognized the men’s faces from a Rohingya activist’s Twitter post; they were reportedly attacked by extremists in a village in northern Rakhine state. Even though I’ve grown to believe and trust these men and their stories, I can’t be completely sure they are who they say they are. One thing is clear, however: No matter how many probing questions I’ve asked, the men have not grown tired of them.Corresponding with these Rohingya men in the past few weeks has brought a different sense of routine to my life. I’ve grown used to the ping of my WhatsApp and the chirp of my Messenger notifications in the morning and late afternoons. I feel relieved when read receipts on my Messenger conversations or blue check marks on the WhatsApp chats appear, indicating that they are still safe, and alive. It has also raised new questions for me about working on stories about conflict-ridden countries. As journalists, we are encouraged to be objective in our reporting, to not meddle in the lives of people that we cover. But seeing these photos and videos and forming relationships with these men elicits in me the very human response of wanting to help. To me, the greatest paradox of the use of social media in the Rohingya crisis is that complete strangers can tell me about their plight, but there’s no way for me to help directly. Yet, in a different context, anyone can start a crowdfunding campaign to help defray medical costs, and a stranger sympathetic to their situation could donate money directly toward that. In the last few weeks, I’ve marveled at how democratizing the internet can be. For the Rohingya, it offers freedom from reality. They can read about the international community’s response to the crisis and can connect with family and friends displaced by violence. A Facebook friend request, if accepted, gives them the ability to live vicariously through a stranger — a stranger who coincidentally has the privilege to help shed light on their stories."

The video went out just one day before the FCC voted to repeal the Obama-era regulations currently in effect. Baauer gave a statement to Billboard Dance about the use of his song without his permission, saying that it “obviously comes as a surprise to me as it was just brought to my attention.”“I want to be clear that it was used completely without my consent or council [sic]. My team and I are currently exploring every single avenue available to get it taken down. I support Net Neutrality like the vast majority of this country and am appalled to be associated with its repeal in anyway.” In addition to Baauer, the record label responsible for “Harlem Shake,” Mad Decent, also tweeted that they do not “approve of the message contained therein” and would be pursuing “further legal action if it is not removed.”As of publication, the video has been removed from Youtube. It is still live on The Daily Caller’s Facebook page."

62,POLITICS,Trump Protesters Facing Felonies Say U.S. Wants To Criminalize The First Amendment,Ryan J. Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/inauguration-trial-j20-trump-doj_us_5a32e337e4b0ff955ad14e6d,"The U.S. government told a D.C. jury that six people -- including a photographer and two medics -- “agreed to destroy your city.""",2017-12-15,"Assistant U.S. Attorney Rizwan Qureshi (left), Metropolitan Police Department Detective Greggory Pemberton (center) and Assistant U.S. Attorney Jennifer Kerkhoff (right) have been leading the charge against Inauguration Day arrestees.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a1dadf0140000000eb6a39f.jpeg?cache=pD1GOcNegQ&ops=crop_181_700_2841_1849%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Attorneys for six people facing felony charges for attending a demonstration that spawned property damage in downtown D.C. on the day of President Donald Trump’s inauguration told jurors here that the Trump administration was trying to “criminalize” their First Amendment rights.The government has conceded there’s no evidence that any of the six individuals currently on trial caused any property damage or committed any violence on Jan. 20, during an anti-fascist demonstration that included anti-capitalist and anarchist elements. But the government has labeled the event a riot, and sought to hold nearly 200 participants who were arrested en masse that day accountable for the actions of those individuals who smashed windows and caused roughly $100,000 in damages.Each of the defendants who have been on trial since Nov. 20 ― Michelle Macchio, Christina Simmons, Jennifer Armento, Oliver Harris, Brittne Lawson and Alexei Wood ― are facing two misdemeanor rioting charges as well as five felony charges of property destruction, which the government contends they’re responsible for because they participated in a conspiracy to riot.The judge overseeing the case issued a judgment of acquittal on a separate felony count of inciting a riot earlier this week, finding that no reasonable juror would have been able to find any of the defendants guilty of that charge given the evidence presented by the government.The outcome of this trial could impact nearly 200 other cases, most of them involving felony charges, against defendants arrested that day. The jury began deliberating the case on Friday afternoon.Assistant U.S. Attorney Rizwan Qureshi told jurors on Thursday that the six defendants and other “co-conspirators” in a group that at times numbered in the hundreds had “agreed to destroy your city, and now they’re hiding behind the First Amendment.”Qureshi said he was “tired” of hearing the chant “Whose streets? Our streets,” and he was sure jurors were too.In her rebuttal to closing arguments from the defense team on Friday morning, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jennifer Kerkhoff told jurors that the mere presence of the protesters at the event once it turned into a riot counted as aiding and abetting the rioting conspiracy. Large groups of people can make people do things they might not otherwise do, she said. “It can give them a type of courage they might not otherwise have, for better or for worse,” Kerkhoff argued. Kerkhoff said that the defendants were “privileged and entitled” for suggesting that the D.C. police should have followed their own rules regarding demonstrations and issued an order of dispersal before making arrests. That didn’t happen on Jan. 20, and defense attorneys have shown videos of officers using excessive force and shooting pepper spray with abandon. In a mocking tone, she suggested it was ridiculous to say that individuals could show up to an anti-fascist and anti-capitalist event in all black and not anticipate there would be criminal activity.Returning to the “sea of black” phrase that the government used repeatedly in opening arguments last month, Qureshi said that the “sea of black” was like the “getaway car” in a bank robbery. “It was basically the tint on that getaway car to make sure nobody was identified,” he said.Carrie Weletz, an attorney representing Armento, said Qureshi left out a role in his comparison.“He’s missing the patsy, that fall guy, that person that takes the fall for those people that actually willingly and intentionally participated in the robbery,” Weletz said. “Ms. Armento is that patsy.”Among the group of defendants currently on trial are two street medics, a photographer who livestreamed the entire event on Facebook, and a college student who was 19 years old at the time and had just voted in her first election.Qureshi, making his case against photographer Alexei Wood, went as far as to assert that it was suspicious for a journalist covering a protest to know the terms “black bloc” and a police “kettle,” both of which are common terms that should be known to reporters familiar with demonstrations and policing practices. A “black bloc” refers to the practice of wearing black clothing, which can make it more difficult for authorities to distinguish between individuals in a group. A police “kettle,” or “kettling,” is a common term for when police encircle large groups of people, a tactic which has been the subject of litigation in D.C.“How is he an up-and-coming journalist and he’s talking about, quote, black bloc?” Qureshi asked the jurors. “How is he an up-and-coming journalist and he’s talking about a kettle? I didn’t know what a kettle was before this case. Did you?”Relatively speaking, prosecutors may have their strongest case against Wood, who had mostly focused on wedding and commercial photography but was trying to break into photojournalism. In his own Facebook livestream, Wood is heard saying “woo” and “who-hoo” and other sounds that could be seen as cheers supportive of destruction, all of which were highlighted in a sizzle reel shown to jurors. And while he never used it or showed it to authorities, Wood was carrying what the government has labeled a “fake” press pass that bore another individual’s name, which hasn’t been fully explained to the jury.Several other journalists were caught in the police kettle. Many of them were let out, and several who were originally charged had their cases dropped (though one case other than Wood’s remains). Wood, although he sent emails to a news outlet soliciting photography work during the inauguration, wasn’t working for any established publication at the time. The government has also claimed that two medics ― Michelle Macchio, 26, of Naples, and Brittne Lawson, 27, of Pittsburgh ― had aided and abetted the rioters because they intended to “provide a service” to the people the government has labeled as their co-conspirators. “What do you need a medic with gauze for? What do you need a medic with all the items that Ms. Kropf [one of the defendant’s lawyers] laid out for?” Qureshi asked the jurors. “I thought this was a protest!” “You can be a journalist and you can riot. You can be a medic, and you can riot,” Kerkhoff said. “They are responsible for the destruction that took place.”In their closing arguments, defense attorneys mostly centered on their clients First Amendment rights. Before the D.C. jury, attorney Steven McCool used the metaphor of a Washington Redskins football game, where most people are dressed in the same color jerseys. Sure, McCool said, there might be “a small number people who want to start trouble, probably from Philly,” making a joke aimed at Qureshi, who is a Philadelphia Eagles fan. “If you’ve been to a section of FedEx [stadium] where this has happened, you’d see hundreds of other people socializing and watching the game. They may wear the same color jersey as those knuckleheads acting up, but that doesn’t mean they’re there to break anything, help someone break something or hide anyone who’s breaking things. The government would have you believe that everyone, the hundreds of people in that section, are breaking the law simply because they didn’t get up and leave.”McCool, a former federal prosecutor, said this case was about the First Amendment and told the jury of D.C. residents ― who are very unlikely to support Trump, statistically speaking ― it was about American’s ability to “speak out against Donald Trump and his message of hate.” He quoted President Barack Obama. And he invoked the civil rights movement, returning to the stadium metaphor.“To understand the gravity of this case and the importance of this matter, we’ve got to go back to that stadium. Different time. There’s no football game. People are speaking from their hearts. No one’s wearing jerseys. They’re wearing T-shirts. Some say ‘Martin.’ Some say ‘Malcolm.’ Some say “Bobby Kennedy.” And Nixon’s thugs or someone else they don’t know starts some trouble,” McCool said.“Think about this. If the law said we had to leave, think about what that would do to our freedom to effect change,” McCool said. “Think about where we would be if they could simply call protesters criminals and silence their voices. That’s what happened in this case. That’s exactly what happened in this case.”He painted Metropolitan Police Commander Keith Deville as a representative of the “old ways of thinking,” who was “telling tall tales” for the government. He reminded jurors about comments that Deville has previously made referring to a Jewish Holocaust survivor as “the one that got away,” and comments he made about a colleague who was transitioning from a man to a woman.Several attorneys also reminded the jurors that the lead detective in the case, Gregg Pemberton, had sent, retweeted or liked a number of tweets that were anti-activist and anti-Black Lives Matter. Pemberton has spent every working day since Trump’s inauguration focused solely on investigating the Jan. 20 unrest.Jamie Heine, representing Macchio, said Friday that convicting her client would “strip the First Amendment of all meaning” and that the case was a massive overreach.“The government is taking things that are perfectly legal ... and trying to convince you that they had been up to something illegal,” Heine said. She called it an “abomination” that the government was trying to undermine the First Amendment because police didn’t want to do their job and hold accountable those who actually inflicted damage that day.“We have to draw a line between what is right and what is wrong,” she said.Sara Kropf, representing defendant Lawson, noted that the prosecution is being led by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia. She suggested that the pursuit of this case was a political decision by the Trump administration.“We know who they report to,” Kropf said. “This is about politics.”Kropf also suggested that jurors could send a message about the value of free speech and constitutional rights. She noted that the First Amendment and the Bill of Rights were ratified exactly 226 years ago, on Dec. 15, 1791.“Silence is dangerous,” Kropf said.The government objected. The objection was sustained.That part of Kropf’s argument was silenced.Ryan Reilly is HuffPost’s senior justice reporter, covering criminal justice, federal law enforcement and legal affairs.

63,MEDIA,Fox News Women Furious Over Rupert Murdoch Comments On Sexual Misconduct,Yashar Ali,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fox-news-women-rupert-murdoch_us_5a343580e4b040881bea8216,"The media mogul said claims of rampant sexual harassment at the network are ""nonsense.""",2017-12-15,"Rupert Murdoch said sexual misconduct allegations at Fox News amount to a few isolated incidents related to the company's former chairman, Roger Ailes.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a3435ad1600000f12cf1808.jpeg?cache=hD7OUIghnR&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Current and former female Fox News employees say they are “stunned,” “disgusted” and “hungry for justice” after media mogul Rupert Murdoch on Thursday dismissed allegations of sexual misconduct at the network as “nonsense” outside of a few “isolated incidents” with former Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes.In a televised interview, Sky News host Ian King focused on the Thursday announcement that the Disney Company is acquiring most of the assets belonging to 21st Century Fox, Fox News Channel’s parent, in a deal valued at $52 billion. Disney is not acquiring Fox News Channel or several other broadcast properties as part of the deal.King asked Murdoch if sexual misconduct allegations had inflicted damage on Fox News Channel.Murdoch said, “All nonsense, there was a problem with our chief executive [Ailes], sort of, over the years, isolated incidents. As soon as we investigated it he was out of the place in hours, well, three or four days. And there’s been nothing else since then. That was largely political because we’re conservative. Now of course the liberals are going down the drain — NBC is in deep trouble. CBS, their stars. I mean there are really bad cases and people should be moved aside. There are other things which probably amount to a bit of flirting.”“Rupert never characterized the sexual harassment matters at FOX News as ‘nonsense,’” a spokesman for 21st Century Fox told HuffPost in a statement Friday night, five hours after this story was initially published. “Rather, he responded negatively to the suggestion that sexual harassment issues were an obstacle to the Company’s bid for the rest of Sky.”“Under Rupert’s leadership and with his total support, the Company exited Roger Ailes, compensated numerous women who were mistreated; trained virtually all of its employees; exited its biggest star; and hired a new head of HR. By his actions, Rupert has made it abundantly clear that he understands that there were real problems at FOX News,” the statement continued. “Rupert values all of the hard-working colleagues at FOX News, and will continue to address these matters to ensure FOX News maintains its commitment to having a work environment based on the values of trust and respect.”For this story, HuffPost spoke with 10 current and former female Fox News staffers, all of whom are or were on-air talent and say they have faced harassment or assault by current and former Fox News executives and on-air talent. They said the comment by Murdoch, who controls the Fox News Channel along with his two sons Lachlan and James through 21st Century Fox, not only diminished the scandal that has plagued the network for over 17 months, it also virtually erased a flood of allegations, terminations, forced resignations and settlements.All the women communicated via text message and asked to remain anonymous, either because they still work at the network or are bound by non-disclosure agreements they signed when they left, or because their current employers don’t allow them to speak to the press without authorization.“I have had to put up with a hostile work environment for years, and now I’m told that it doesn’t exist by a man who doesn’t have to walk these halls every day? I’m hungry for justice,” said one woman who is part of the network’s on-air talent.“Hey Rupert - stop with the lies or we’ll go public with the truth. All of it. Including about the talent and executives you still employ who have harassed us and don’t give a damn about workplace respect - only money,” said a woman who was previously a member of Fox News’ on-air talent. “How much will it take before you actually start caring about your female employees? Is your 52 billion enough? Are we really going to clean house now?”Murdoch’s comment directly contradicts the public relations strategy of Fox News and 21st Century Fox, which has been to diligently tell reporters the era of Ailes, who died this year, and host Bill O’Reilly is over. Instead, the press reps say, Fox News has ushered in a new era of corporate responsibility and a workplace free of hostility and retaliation.The comment is also unusual because Fox News has been the subject of a federal investigation into Ailes’ settlements for over a year. The U.S. Attorney, the FBI and the United States Postal Inspection Service are all assisting with the probe, which is looking at whether Ailes’ payouts violated federal law because they were not disclosed to shareholders. The Postal Service is involved because the investigation includes potential mail and wire fraud violations. Fox News has been plagued by accusations of sexual misconduct, especially in the last year and a half. In July 2016, former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson stunned the media world when she filed a lawsuit saying Ailes had harassed and retaliated against her over a number of years. 21st Century Fox hired the white-shoe law firm Paul Weiss to conduct an investigation into the allegations, and current and former Fox News staffers and on-air talent told the firm Ailes had subjected them to harassment and retaliation. Ailes was forced to resign three weeks after Carlson filed her lawsuit, and left with a $40 million payout.Since then, New York magazine, The New York Times and other publications have reported how Ailes used company funds to pay off women who alleged he had harassed and abused them. Laurie Luhn, a former Fox News booker, received a $3.15 million severance in 2011 that Ailes arranged. She told New York magazine Ailes subjected her to psychological torture and harassment for years.The New York Times also reported in April that O’Reilly had settled multiple sexual harassment suits while at the network, with the company’s knowledge. After virtually all of his advertisers pulled out, O’Reilly was ousted with a reported $25 million payout.In August, HuffPost reported that Fox News host Eric Bolling sent unsolicited lewd photos to colleagues. A month later, Fox News ousted him. And in October, the Times reported O’Reilly had settled a sexual harassment lawsuit brought by Fox News legal analyst Lis Wiehl for $32 million. 21st Century Fox had seen a draft of the lawsuit and knew O’Reilly had settled, but it still renewed the host’s contract in February 2017 for four more years, at $25 million a year.As the scandals have unfolded, I’ve spoken to women at the network about their own experiences and responses to the allegations. I have never received more pointed feedback than I did after Murdoch’s comments.Lauren Sivan, a television reporter who worked at Fox News and now works at a Fox station in Los Angeles owned by 21st Century Fox, said Ailes used to have her sit on his lap so he could monitor her breathing and diaphragm. He did this, she said, under the false premise of helping her speak better on television. Several women at Fox News said Ailes required them to sit on his lap and engage in the same exercise.“What kind of company pays close to 100 million dollars to keep ‘flirting’ quiet?” Sivan said in response to Murdoch’s quote.“Did this man [Murdoch] just forget the 100 million dollars his company had to pay in settlements for terrible men behaving badly?” said a current Fox news host. “He now says it was a bit of ‘flirting’ and an issue related to the fact that Fox News has conservative hosts? Sexual harassment has nothing to do with politics. Many of us are conservative and want the truth to come out. Those of us who still work at Fox News have anxiety issues every time we see another woman coming forward with stories we have all lived through but have never shared.”“The harassment was persistent and ongoing,” said a former Fox News reporter. “It was personally and professionally devastating for some of my colleagues and me. When the person who signs your paycheck and is responsible for promotions and demotions harasses women who rely on him, it’s more than ‘sort of’ a problem. Roger’s circle of advisors laughed off the problem and enabled his behavior to continue for years. Rupert’s dismissal is a crude insult to women. He should know better.”Tamara Holder, a Fox News commentator who settled with the network earlier this year over a sexual assault claim, said, “You cannot rewrite history, Mr. Murdoch. The problem was not only with your chief executive. For example, one of your former executives trapped me in his office, pulled-out his penis and shoved my head on it. That’s not ‘nonsense.’ That’s criminal.”“The culture at Fox News won’t change until you publicly accept that it has been a breeding ground for sexual misconduct over the past two decades,” Holder said.Rudi Bakhtiar worked at CNN as an anchor and reporter for close to a decade before joining Fox News in 2005. About a year after she joined, she says Brian Wilson, a weekend Fox News anchor who had just been tapped to be the new Washington Fox News bureau chief made unwanted sexual advances towards her while promising her a promotion in exchange. When she complained of his behavior, she was retaliated against and eventually fired. She received a settlement from Fox News which included a non-disclosure agreement. After Gretchen Carlson filed suit against Ailes in 2016, Bakhtiar decided to break her NDA to speak out about the abuses at Fox News. Since being terminated by Fox News, Bakhtiar who held several prominent positions at CNN, has not seen her on-air career recover. In reaction to Murdoch’s statement, Bakhtiar told HuffPost, “Rupert Murdoch knows the sexual harassment allegations extended well beyond Roger Ailes. In my case it was Brian Wilson, the newly assigned Washington D.C. bureau chief, who offered me the job full time if I would show him the inside of my hotel room. A management culture including then VP Bill Shine who covered up for him and other executives, hosts, and reporters. I broke my NDA because I realized that this had to stop. Shame on Mr. Murdoch. Even now he can’t do or say the right thing. That’s precisely why the culture perpetuated and lasted so long on his watch. He knew. He knew and he didn’t care. He still doesn’t care that his company unfairly destroyed the careers of many hardworking talented women while covering for sexual harassers time after time.”Carlson also replied to the comments, saying, “Mr. Murdoch: sexual harassment isn’t ‘flirting,’ ‘nonsense,’ ‘largely political’ or simply ‘isolated incidents.’ I’m calling on you to release all women who complained about sexual harassment at Fox News from the secrecy agreements you forced them to sign and let the truth come out.

64,MEDIA,Fox News Women Furious Over Rupert Murdoch Comments On Sexual Misconduct,Yashar Ali,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fox-news-women-rupert-murdoch_us_5a343580e4b040881bea8216,"The media mogul said claims of rampant sexual harassment at the network are ""nonsense.""",2017-12-15,Bill O’Reilly has settled multiple sexual harassment lawsuits while at Fox News.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a343ac71500001f0049bf57.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Current and former female Fox News employees say they are “stunned,” “disgusted” and “hungry for justice” after media mogul Rupert Murdoch on Thursday dismissed allegations of sexual misconduct at the network as “nonsense” outside of a few “isolated incidents” with former Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes.In a televised interview, Sky News host Ian King focused on the Thursday announcement that the Disney Company is acquiring most of the assets belonging to 21st Century Fox, Fox News Channel’s parent, in a deal valued at $52 billion. Disney is not acquiring Fox News Channel or several other broadcast properties as part of the deal.King asked Murdoch if sexual misconduct allegations had inflicted damage on Fox News Channel.Murdoch said, “All nonsense, there was a problem with our chief executive [Ailes], sort of, over the years, isolated incidents. As soon as we investigated it he was out of the place in hours, well, three or four days. And there’s been nothing else since then. That was largely political because we’re conservative. Now of course the liberals are going down the drain — NBC is in deep trouble. CBS, their stars. I mean there are really bad cases and people should be moved aside. There are other things which probably amount to a bit of flirting.”“Rupert never characterized the sexual harassment matters at FOX News as ‘nonsense,’” a spokesman for 21st Century Fox told HuffPost in a statement Friday night, five hours after this story was initially published. “Rather, he responded negatively to the suggestion that sexual harassment issues were an obstacle to the Company’s bid for the rest of Sky.”“Under Rupert’s leadership and with his total support, the Company exited Roger Ailes, compensated numerous women who were mistreated; trained virtually all of its employees; exited its biggest star; and hired a new head of HR. By his actions, Rupert has made it abundantly clear that he understands that there were real problems at FOX News,” the statement continued. “Rupert values all of the hard-working colleagues at FOX News, and will continue to address these matters to ensure FOX News maintains its commitment to having a work environment based on the values of trust and respect.”For this story, HuffPost spoke with 10 current and former female Fox News staffers, all of whom are or were on-air talent and say they have faced harassment or assault by current and former Fox News executives and on-air talent. They said the comment by Murdoch, who controls the Fox News Channel along with his two sons Lachlan and James through 21st Century Fox, not only diminished the scandal that has plagued the network for over 17 months, it also virtually erased a flood of allegations, terminations, forced resignations and settlements.All the women communicated via text message and asked to remain anonymous, either because they still work at the network or are bound by non-disclosure agreements they signed when they left, or because their current employers don’t allow them to speak to the press without authorization.“I have had to put up with a hostile work environment for years, and now I’m told that it doesn’t exist by a man who doesn’t have to walk these halls every day? I’m hungry for justice,” said one woman who is part of the network’s on-air talent.“Hey Rupert - stop with the lies or we’ll go public with the truth. All of it. Including about the talent and executives you still employ who have harassed us and don’t give a damn about workplace respect - only money,” said a woman who was previously a member of Fox News’ on-air talent. “How much will it take before you actually start caring about your female employees? Is your 52 billion enough? Are we really going to clean house now?”Murdoch’s comment directly contradicts the public relations strategy of Fox News and 21st Century Fox, which has been to diligently tell reporters the era of Ailes, who died this year, and host Bill O’Reilly is over. Instead, the press reps say, Fox News has ushered in a new era of corporate responsibility and a workplace free of hostility and retaliation.The comment is also unusual because Fox News has been the subject of a federal investigation into Ailes’ settlements for over a year. The U.S. Attorney, the FBI and the United States Postal Inspection Service are all assisting with the probe, which is looking at whether Ailes’ payouts violated federal law because they were not disclosed to shareholders. The Postal Service is involved because the investigation includes potential mail and wire fraud violations. Fox News has been plagued by accusations of sexual misconduct, especially in the last year and a half. In July 2016, former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson stunned the media world when she filed a lawsuit saying Ailes had harassed and retaliated against her over a number of years. 21st Century Fox hired the white-shoe law firm Paul Weiss to conduct an investigation into the allegations, and current and former Fox News staffers and on-air talent told the firm Ailes had subjected them to harassment and retaliation. Ailes was forced to resign three weeks after Carlson filed her lawsuit, and left with a $40 million payout.Since then, New York magazine, The New York Times and other publications have reported how Ailes used company funds to pay off women who alleged he had harassed and abused them. Laurie Luhn, a former Fox News booker, received a $3.15 million severance in 2011 that Ailes arranged. She told New York magazine Ailes subjected her to psychological torture and harassment for years.The New York Times also reported in April that O’Reilly had settled multiple sexual harassment suits while at the network, with the company’s knowledge. After virtually all of his advertisers pulled out, O’Reilly was ousted with a reported $25 million payout.In August, HuffPost reported that Fox News host Eric Bolling sent unsolicited lewd photos to colleagues. A month later, Fox News ousted him. And in October, the Times reported O’Reilly had settled a sexual harassment lawsuit brought by Fox News legal analyst Lis Wiehl for $32 million. 21st Century Fox had seen a draft of the lawsuit and knew O’Reilly had settled, but it still renewed the host’s contract in February 2017 for four more years, at $25 million a year.As the scandals have unfolded, I’ve spoken to women at the network about their own experiences and responses to the allegations. I have never received more pointed feedback than I did after Murdoch’s comments.Lauren Sivan, a television reporter who worked at Fox News and now works at a Fox station in Los Angeles owned by 21st Century Fox, said Ailes used to have her sit on his lap so he could monitor her breathing and diaphragm. He did this, she said, under the false premise of helping her speak better on television. Several women at Fox News said Ailes required them to sit on his lap and engage in the same exercise.“What kind of company pays close to 100 million dollars to keep ‘flirting’ quiet?” Sivan said in response to Murdoch’s quote.“Did this man [Murdoch] just forget the 100 million dollars his company had to pay in settlements for terrible men behaving badly?” said a current Fox news host. “He now says it was a bit of ‘flirting’ and an issue related to the fact that Fox News has conservative hosts? Sexual harassment has nothing to do with politics. Many of us are conservative and want the truth to come out. Those of us who still work at Fox News have anxiety issues every time we see another woman coming forward with stories we have all lived through but have never shared.”“The harassment was persistent and ongoing,” said a former Fox News reporter. “It was personally and professionally devastating for some of my colleagues and me. When the person who signs your paycheck and is responsible for promotions and demotions harasses women who rely on him, it’s more than ‘sort of’ a problem. Roger’s circle of advisors laughed off the problem and enabled his behavior to continue for years. Rupert’s dismissal is a crude insult to women. He should know better.”Tamara Holder, a Fox News commentator who settled with the network earlier this year over a sexual assault claim, said, “You cannot rewrite history, Mr. Murdoch. The problem was not only with your chief executive. For example, one of your former executives trapped me in his office, pulled-out his penis and shoved my head on it. That’s not ‘nonsense.’ That’s criminal.”“The culture at Fox News won’t change until you publicly accept that it has been a breeding ground for sexual misconduct over the past two decades,” Holder said.Rudi Bakhtiar worked at CNN as an anchor and reporter for close to a decade before joining Fox News in 2005. About a year after she joined, she says Brian Wilson, a weekend Fox News anchor who had just been tapped to be the new Washington Fox News bureau chief made unwanted sexual advances towards her while promising her a promotion in exchange. When she complained of his behavior, she was retaliated against and eventually fired. She received a settlement from Fox News which included a non-disclosure agreement. After Gretchen Carlson filed suit against Ailes in 2016, Bakhtiar decided to break her NDA to speak out about the abuses at Fox News. Since being terminated by Fox News, Bakhtiar who held several prominent positions at CNN, has not seen her on-air career recover. In reaction to Murdoch’s statement, Bakhtiar told HuffPost, “Rupert Murdoch knows the sexual harassment allegations extended well beyond Roger Ailes. In my case it was Brian Wilson, the newly assigned Washington D.C. bureau chief, who offered me the job full time if I would show him the inside of my hotel room. A management culture including then VP Bill Shine who covered up for him and other executives, hosts, and reporters. I broke my NDA because I realized that this had to stop. Shame on Mr. Murdoch. Even now he can’t do or say the right thing. That’s precisely why the culture perpetuated and lasted so long on his watch. He knew. He knew and he didn’t care. He still doesn’t care that his company unfairly destroyed the careers of many hardworking talented women while covering for sexual harassers time after time.”Carlson also replied to the comments, saying, “Mr. Murdoch: sexual harassment isn’t ‘flirting,’ ‘nonsense,’ ‘largely political’ or simply ‘isolated incidents.’ I’m calling on you to release all women who complained about sexual harassment at Fox News from the secrecy agreements you forced them to sign and let the truth come out. Let the public decide if the behavior to which women were subjected was ‘flirting.’” She tweeted the same statement soon after.Some Fox News women who have never come forward publicly with their complaints say they are considering sharing what they experienced, and were willing to walk out if necessary.

The “Late Late Show” host revealed Thursday that because the baby was born a few weeks before her due date, he and his wife didn’t have a name picked out ― though he said he did get close to accidentally naming his daughter Beyoncé. “After the baby was born — anyone who’s been in this situation will know — we were both crying, I was crying my eyes out, my wife’s crying her eyes out, the baby’s crying and the doctor asked about her name … and I looked at the doctor and said, ‘We’re going to call her Beyoncé,’” Corden said. “My wife did not think that was funny,” he added. “Especially after the nurse went to the other side of the room and started filling out her form with the name Beyoncé and I had to go over to her and say, ‘There’s only one Beyoncé.’”Corden said he and his wife still haven’t picked out a name, but they’re “so happy.” “We feel so blessed and so lucky. I feel so lucky just to be here telling you about it, I really, really do,” the host said. “And if anyone out there is wondering what to get me for Christmas, a vasectomy would be wonderful. I think we’re done now!” "
66,QUEER VOICES,"Roy Moore May Be Done, But Steve Bannon Remains A Dangerous Threat To Civil Rights",Michelangelo Signorile,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/roy-moore-steve-bannon_us_5a32728ae4b091ca2685b50e,"His march to elect extremists and bigots continues, with Donald Trump's full support.",2017-12-15,"Michelangelo Signorile - Editor-at-large, HuffPost",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55b4f8ac1d00001c00142a30.jpg?ops=100_100,"The victory by Doug Jones in Alabama on Tuesday night was enormous for Democrats and progressives, and a major blow to the GOP. And vanquishing Roy Moore, a theocrat, racist and accused child molester was powerful. I’d interviewed Moore twice over the past several years, on everything from his belief that the U.S. is a “Christian nation” to his false declaration that homosexuality is “evil” according to the U.S. Constitution and thus should be criminalized. It was exhilarating to see him lose in a nail-biter.But Steve Bannon, the former White House advisor who raced to Moore’s side in the primaries and attempted to rescue him in the general election, helped bring Moore to the brink of a win in the very close race by using Nazi propaganda techniques Bannon has long admired. As Joshua Green at Bloomberg reported the day before the election: Bannon worked to create a counter-narrative that ultimately would change many Republicans’ perception of the [teen sexual abuse] scandal. A former filmmaker, he’s long been captivated by the propaganda films of Leni Riefenstahl, the Nazi filmmaker, and the Soviet director Sergei Eisenstein for their power to shape public sentiment. Earlier this year, Bannon told the New Yorker’s Jane Mayer his 2012 anti-Obama film “The Hope and the Change,” had consciously mimicked Riefenstahl’s infamous, “Triumph of the Will.” Her film, he added, “seared into me” that unhappy voters could be influenced if they felt they were being conned.Bannon is now on to other races in other states. No one should believe he’s down and out because of this loss and because GOP establishment figures are pointing fingers at him and demanding he be ostracized. The day following the Alabama Senate election loss Bannon was already on the phone with Donald Trump, who clearly has no interest in severing ties with him and is sloughing off the Alabama debacle. You can bet Bannon will continue to offer his destructive and ugly advice to a president who lacks any political vision and relies on scam artists like Bannon. With backers such as Trump billionaire megadonors Robert and Rebecca Mercer, it’s unlikely money will dry up for Bannon-backed candidates even as the GOP shuns him.That anyone can question whether or not Bannon is sympathetic to white supremacists and bigots of all kinds and will promote them for his own cause is ridiculous, simply by looking at Breitbart, the site he runs, and its infamous headlines ― and looking at his backing of Moore, a man nostalgic for the days of slavery.Bannon’s stated goal in trying to elect Moore was to help tear down Mitch McConnell and the GOP establishment. But the fact that he had no problem promoting an extremist and accused teen predator like Moore goes a long way toward showing us what he truly believes or, at the very least, what he’ll accept in a candidate. (Of course, we knew that with his support for Trump, but Moore took it to whole other level.)As Kurt Bardella, fomer Breitbart spokesperson (who’s now left the GOP entirely), told me in an interview last week on my show on SiriusXM Progress regarding Bannon’s motives in promoting Moore: “Because [Bannon] is a racist. Because he is basically a white supremacist. Because he is a sexist.”(Full disclosure: Bannon was recently brought back to SiriusXM Patriot, to host a Breitbart radio show, in a move that caused some celebrities, like Seth Rogen and John Leguizamo, to cancel their SiriusXM interview tours, while many subscribers, in tweets, pledged to boycott SiriusXM. I’ve made my opinion clear that Bannon shouldn’t have been brought back. Promotion of white nationalism and racism aren’t acceptable on the spectrum of “diverse opinions.” Bannon has free speech, but no company is compelled to associate with it. I am, however, adamantly opposed to any boycott, since, as my colleague Dean Obeidallah eloquently explains, SiriusXM Progress, which has helped connect and organize the Resistance across the country, would be hurt, and that would be self-defeating.)Bannon is focusing on Arizona for 2018 and the open seat left by the retiring GOP senator Jeff Flake, promoting the bigoted, anti-LGBTQ Kelli Ward ― who tried previously to beat John McCain and failed. He is also backing extremist candidates in Senate races in Wisconsin, Montana, Nevada, Tennessee and elsewhere (candidates, like Tennessee’s Rep. Marsha Blackburn, who refused to demand Roy Moore drop out of the race), to take on GOP senators or establishment GOP candidates in the primaries with the hope of beating a Democrat in the general election.Similarly, he’s focused on the House, where he’s backing and encouraging, among others, former GOP House member and convicted felon Michael Grimm in New York. Grimm, fresh out of prison after being found guilty on 20 counts, including tax evasion and perjury, has signaled he may run again for the Staten Island seat from which he’d resigned. Grimm violently threatened a gay reporter from NY1 in a homophobic rant back in 2014. Democrats should be emboldened in beating back Bannon and his racist crew in Virginia’s gubernatorial race (where Bannon’s “Trumpism without Trump,” as he called GOP candidate Ed Gillespie’s strategy, failed) and in Alabama’s U.S. Senate race, but they must not get overly confident. Bannon thrives on depressing turnout among Democrats and progressives while energizing alt-right racists and using Nazi propaganda strategies, fake news and other despicable tactics on GOP voters who are already receptive to his message. Alabama should be seen as another example, like Virginia, of what works for Democrats: Taking the white nationalist threat seriously, and getting the base out, since there are many more of us, enough to overcome voter suppression, Russian interference and anything else they throw our way. When we turn out, we win.Follow Michelangelo Signorile on Twitter: www.twitter.com/msignorile"

69,GREEN,Missing From Amazon's Search For A Second Home: The Climate Effects,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amazon-hq-search-climate-effect_us_5a32eac6e4b0ff955ad15345,"The internet giant touts its green bona fides, but its HQ2 contest ignores global warming.",2017-12-15,A chart from Greenpeace's 2017 report on tech companies' carbon pollution shows Amazon's low ranking compared to rivals. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a32ee071600004700c500cf.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When Amazon kicked off a bidding war for its second North American headquarters in September, the company laid out a vision of its perfect suitor. The ideal city would have more than a million people, mass transit, an international airport, attractive housing and “stable and business-friendly” regulations. But the retail goliath apparently isn’t worried about how surging seas, extreme weather and deadly heat waves might affect its operations or the 50,000 employees it promises to hire in its new $5 billion “second home.” The company also doesn’t seem overly concerned with how much its ravenous appetite for energy and reliance on fleets of fossil-fueled delivery trucks are making those things worse. Amazon made no mention of climate change in its “HQ2” requests for proposals. Few, if any, of the public bids from 238 cities in 54 states, provinces and territories throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico included risks from warming temperatures. Likewise, Amazon refuses to release data on its greenhouse gas emissions, making the Seattle-based giant a pariah among environmentalists who rank it as one of the least transparent corporations of its size. This year, unseasonable wildfires, 1,000-year floods and back-to-back scale-topping hurricanes made climate change more tangible for many Americans. Yet the nearly $566 billion corporate titan has managed to erect a tent around its circus over a second headquarters to try to keep out the frightening weather. And all the players seem willing to ignore the forecast.The company plans to announce its decision next year. In the meantime, analysts made their own rankings. Moody’s Analytics considered 34 variables, including costs, quality of life and transportation. The analysis, published in October, ranked Austin, Texas, a city racked in recent years by drought and flooding, first. Atlanta, prone to heat waves, was second. Philadelphia, a coastal city at risk of sea level rise, came in third.“We didn’t take into consideration climate change risk or rising sea waters or anything like that,” Adam Ozimek, co-author of the analysis and a senior economist at Moody’s, told HuffPost. “Within the United States, within the 50 states, it’s hard to look and find places where you’re seeing major divestment or declines in investment due to reasons of climate change.”Another analysis by Anderson Economic Group yielded different results but still ignored climate change. CNN and The New York Times made their own lists but mentioned “climate” only in reference to business regulations. Noticing the research void, Aseem Prakash, director of the University of Washington’s Center for Environmental Politics, formulated his own ranking based on climate vulnerability. He and his fellow researcher, Nives Dolšak, calculated the total number of days each county spent under a federally declared emergency or disaster. They based the assessment on 25 years of Federal Emergency Management Agency data on severe storms, flooding, hurricanes, tornadoes, snow, coastal floods and weather-related fires. They used 1992 as the start date to include Hurricane Andrew, the second-most damaging storm in the U.S. after the 1926 Great Miami storm. Only two cities ― Portland, Oregon, and Pittsburgh ― ranked in the top 10 for both the Moody’s study and theirs. “This suggests that economic and business criteria probably do not help us to understand a city’s vulnerability to climate change,” Prakash wrote in a blog post for HuffPost. Amazon declined to comment for this story. The company lists efforts to save energy, use local and salvaged wood in its building interiors and recycle heat from a data center to warm its Seattle offices in its request for proposal. “Amazon is committed to sustainability efforts,” the firm states in the materials. “Amazon will develop HQ2 with a dedication to sustainability.” Yet including climate data in economic and market forecasts remains a surprisingly novel concept. It’s only been in the past two to three years that insurance companies ― whose business is based on predicting and planning for potential risks ― began seriously reconsidering how it plans for a warmer future. The British Labour Party announced plans to include climate change in its economic predictions just last month. And most big tech companies, such as Facebook, Apple and Alphabet’s Google, release detailed reports on their energy use and overall output of carbon pollution. But not Amazon. The company touts its efforts to reduce its emissions of planet-warming gases, trumpeting the solar panels on its warehouse roofs and encouraging customers to recycle its packaging. In October, CEO Jeff Bezos tweeted a video of himself christening the company’s 18th renewable-energy project and largest wind farm yet ― a roughly 100-turbine operation in Snyder, Texas ― with a bottle of Champagne.  But Amazon scored an F for energy transparency, a D for renewable commitment policies and a C for energy efficiency on Greenpeace’s 2017 Clicking Green report. The annual report uses submissions by the company to Greenpeace, investor reports, investment announcements and media stories. “They’re one of the least transparent companies, tech or otherwise, of their size that don’t report their greenhouse gas emissions,” Gary Cook, a corporate campaigner at Greenpeace, told HuffPost by phone. “They’ve certainly done some sizable renewable energy deals in the last two years, but if you don’t know how much they’re solving for in terms of energy demand and smog, it’s hard to assess how big these are.” While Amazon may be best known for its e-commerce store, the lion’s share of its profit comes from its Amazon Web Services arm, which controls about 42 percent of the global cloud-computer infrastructure that powers the internet. The division generated $4.58 billion in revenue in the third quarter of this year, Amazon reported in October. The company’s e-commerce branch operates on thin margins, but AWS rakes in profit. The division earned $1.17 billion in income, compared with just $347 million from the rest of the company for the quarter.The data centers host a huge swath of the internet ― including Netflix, Yahoo and HuffPost ― and require enormous amounts of electricity. One data center uses as much electricity as 25,000 homes. The world’s data centers already constitute about 3 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, and the sector’s energy consumption is set to triple in the next decade. Amazon could leapfrog its rivals by making climate change and renewable energy a key focus of its hunt for a second headquarters, Cook said. “For them to signal that this is important to them would really drive a much broader conversation among cities who are saying, ‘Hey, we want Amazon and companies like them. We need to help them achieve their goals and deliver infrastructure, electricity and transportation options to advance their goals,’” he said.  Amazon operates with a monopolistic power, leveraging its dominance in e-commerce and cloud-computer to become a powerful player in other markets, such as television production, publishing and fashion. The ethics of that power concentration aside, the company has a responsibility to use its market dominance to force systemic changes in its industry, Prakash said. If the company began pressuring UPS, FedEx and other delivery services to convert their truck fleets to electric vehicles, it could dramatically decrease the carbon pollution of each package sent from an Amazon warehouse.“If Amazon does, others will follow because it has clout,” Prakash told HuffPost by phone. “That’s why it’s so disappointing that with the HQ2 they forgot about climate change. To me it suggests this kind of thinking is not deeply ingrained; it’s still superficial.”  "

She will continue in the job until Jan. 20.“[Did] she have any qualifications to work in the White House?” Ingraham asked.“Look, she was very loyal to the president,” Spicer said. “I think the president brought a lot of people who wanted to fulfill his agenda. And that’s his prerogative as president-elect. ... I wish her the best. But I don’t ... I’m not really sure.”In a statement after the announcement of her resignation, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders released a statement about Newman wishing her “the best in future endeavors” and stating how grateful the administration is for her service.Newman made an appearance on “Good Morning America” on Thursday and denied reports that White House Chief of Staff John Kelly had fired her, adding that she had “seen things” during her tenure in the White House that made her “uncomfortable” and “deeply and emotionally” affected her. Newman also said that she has a “profound story” that the “world will want to hear.”As for Spicer’s own tenure in the White House, he told Ingraham that “it was truly an honor to do this” and he “was proud to be part of the president moving his agenda forward.”"
71,ENTERTAINMENT,White Critics Love 'Three Billboards' Like They Love Their Racist Uncles,Zeba Blay,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/white-critics-three-billboards-racism_us_5a3135eae4b091ca268479f3,"And when they won't engage with race, neither will filmmakers.",2017-12-15,"Sam Rockwell and Frances McDormand face off in ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a33f56f150000490049be59.jpeg?cache=RhLphQpjAM&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"“Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri” is one of the most divisive films of the year, but it’s poised for an impressive award season. In the past week alone, the film received major nominations from both the Golden Globes and the Screen Actors Guild Awards (where it leads among motion pictures with four nods). Experts predict that nominations for best picture and best director at the Academy Awards are a given. Written, produced and directed by British-Irish playwright Martin McDonagh (based on a script he wrote eight years ago), “Three Billboards” is a black comedy centered on the formidable Mildred Hayes, who’s trying to find answers after the violent rape and murder of her daughter several months ago.With no progress in the case, Hayes (played brilliantly by Frances McDormand) pays for three billboards to be put up on a road just outside her town, which read:“RAPED WHILE DYING, ” “AND STILL NO ARRESTS,”“HOW COME, CHIEF WILLOUGHBY?”The movie is about the fallout from these billboards, as Hayes grapples with her grief as well as backlash from people in town ― particularly a belligerent, goofy, racist cop played by Sam Rockwell, a man who is fiercely loyal to the ailing Chief Bill Willoughby (Woody Harrelson).Despite an initial slew of critical praise, and now a steady stream of recognition this award season, “Three Billboards” faces its own small kind of backlash. Because the movie, which explores themes of violence, justice and morality, has a glaring blind spot when it comes to race, one that some critics say ultimately renders it a failure.NPR’s Gene Demby (a former HuffPost editor) has been especially vocal about this on Twitter, posting at length about how the film drops the ball in its handling of Rockwell’s character, Officer Jason Dixon. For Denby, the fact that Dixon’s violence and racism are presented simply as “a kind of edgy character detail” is a problem.Other critics have questioned the necessity of Rockwell’s racist cop character, and have called out the movie’s use of black characters as props and the forced, unearned redemption arc of Officer Dixon. That the only three speaking black characters (a co-worker of Hayes’, a police chief, and a dude who helped put up the billboards) have absolutely no interiority is not a surprise. This is such a predictable trope in a Hollywood movie about a mostly white town that it’s not even offensive, just boring. The real issues come from the false equivalency the movie makes between racism and anger, as if the two are interchangeable.In a letter from his beloved boss, Dixon is told that if he can let go of his anger and hatred and embrace love, he can finally become the good man he truly is deep inside. As if love is actually a solution to (racist) hate and (racist) anger. But this is the redemption that Dixon needs, and suddenly he transforms from some asshole racist cop into a “good man,” bent on helping Hayes find the man who killed her daughter. This “good man,” it should be noted, is apparently notorious in town for having tortured a black man under the protection of the badge at some point in the past. It’s a detail that’s referred to constantly, but never fully explored.Criticism of the movie’s approach to race should not hinge on whether Rockwell’s character and the movie’s overall racial themes (or lack thereof) are offensive, but whether they are actually successful. Because while the movie is focused mostly on female revenge and rage, it has received praise for its approach to race, too. McDonagh recently told the Los Angeles Times that he believes the movie says “an awful lot” about race and policing. “It might not end up on a perfect plate for everybody,” he said, “but I think it’s coming at it from an interesting angle.”In response to the backlash over the film’s moral ambiguity, its conflation of racism and hate (remember, a person doesn’t have to be hateful in order to be racist), McDonagh added:“That ambiguity is exactly what I was going for in it. So it’s not a surprise, I think, and it’s nothing I can’t happily defend at any stage. I think it’s a really good film, and I think often the backlash is kind of a knee-jerk reaction maybe. And I think certainly in time — not right now, in time — the heart of the film will definitely be seen as something that’s deserving to be recognized.”Moral ambiguity is a favorite defense for art that is simply indifferent to the themes it purports to be intentionally ambiguous about. That’s also boring. It’s ultimately debatable whether, beyond its jarring approach to race, “Three Billboards” is really that great of a movie, whether it deserves all its praise. In many ways, “Three Billboards” is just an OK film masquerading as a great one. But whether or not it’s good is less compelling a debate than what its critical success says about the overall whiteness of the critical machine. Films that approach race by pandering to white people, especially white liberals, almost always receive praise (from white critics) for their nuance. It happened with Academy Award best picture winner “Crash,” it happened with “The Blind Side,” it happened earlier this year with “Detroit.”Yes, “Three Billboards” isn’t explicitly about race, but it plays into this kind of pandering. Rockwell’s character is the racist uncle whom white liberals fear and love. The ability to feel for him ― to root for him in spite of his past transgressions, because he really is a “good man at heart,” an idiot who doesn’t know any better ― offers a kind of catharsis for the white viewer who can’t or won’t deal with true nuance, who is unable to reconcile their own complicity with their desire to be “good.” And that’s genuinely fine, if that’s what the film set out to do. This disconnect between (mostly white) viewers who see Dixon’s having tortured a black man as a character quirk, a shorthand for anger and sadness, and (black) viewers like Denby, who can’t let go of this character quirk in order to root for the character, lies at the center of what makes the award-season success of “Three Billboards” so fascinating. Its success lies on a continuum of movies that go largely unchallenged by critics and audiences because they absolve certain viewers from actually having to care about the larger implications of their themes. Because few critics are willing or able to engage critically with the movie on race, McDonagh himself does not have to engage, does not have to wrestle with some of his failures as an artist.He can dismiss valid racial critiques of his film as irrelevant or “knee-jerk.” He can hold on to his defenses, and point to the accolades and trophies as confirmation of his genius. Ultimately, it’s the art that suffers. And the cycle continues. "

Cline had faced up to three years in prison on each count.Liz White, a former patient of Clines, told The Associated Press she is disappointed in the verdict.“The fact is our pain was not acknowledged,” she said.The prominent doctor, who graduated from medical school in 1964 and retired in 2009, may have fathered dozens of children, according to White’s son, Matt White.The 35-year-old told CBS News that private DNA testing has shown Cline is the biological father of at least 23 people. “He violated women’s reproductive rights for close to a decade,” Matt White said, adding that additional testing may be performed.Prosecutors are unable to file additional charges against Cline because there is no law on the books in Indiana that prohibits fertility doctors from using their own sperm. Liz White told FOX 59 ― the outlet that first broke the story in 2015 ― that she is working with legislative committees to criminalize it.According to a probable cause affidavit obtained by The Chicago Tribune, the Indiana Attorney General’s Office launched an investigation into Cline in 2014, after two adult children of Cline’s former patients filed a complaint.The complainants said they had submitted their DNA to a private company while researching their ancestry. When their DNA was entered into the company’s database, they were matched to several other individuals. Further investigation by the complainants revealed their mothers had been patients of Cline, the affidavit states.Cline denied the allegations.“I can emphatically say that at no time did I ever use my own sample for insemination,” he wrote in a letter to investigators.Cline, authorities said, confessed to six adults who suspected him of being their father that he’d donated his own sperm approximately 50 times between 1971 and 1981.“Dr. Cline admitted to doing wrong by inseminating the women with his own sperm, but felt that he was helping women because they really wanted a baby,” the affidavit said. “Also, he felt pressured to use his own sperm because he didn’t always have access to fresh sperm.”Cline deceived patients who sought his help, telling them he was artificially inseminating them with donated sperm and that no single donor would be used more than three times, the affidavit said.Paternity tests performed by the Marion County prosecutor’s office in August 2016 showed a 99.9 percent probability that Cline was the father of the two complainants, according to court records.Cline expressed remorse during Thursday’s court hearing and apologized to “those who feel deceived and hurt.”“I was scared ... I was foolish in my actions and I should not have lied,” he said, according to WWL-TV.Cline’s explanation did not sit well with Julie Harmon, 35, who told the AP that DNA testing shows Cline is her biological father.“His only remorse was being caught,” she said. “He has no remorse over the act at all.”Send David Lohr an email or follow him on Facebook and Twitter.

Her lawyer, Ari Wilkenfeld, appeared on the “Today” show Friday morning to advocate for his client’s right to privacy. The anonymous woman was the first of multiple women to accuse the former “Today” host of workplace sexual misconduct.“She showed her face, she gave her name, she told her story and at the conclusion of the interview she was asked, ‘What do you want?’” Wilkenfeld told NBC’s Stephanie Gosk, describing the accuser’s interaction with the network. “And she said, ‘I want you guys to do the right thing and, also, I’d like you guys to maintain my confidentiality.’”NBC fired Lauer in November, but did not elaborate about the allegations at the time. The New York Post’s Page Six later cited anonymous sources who accused Lauer of assaulting a female NBC staffer at the 2014 Sochi Olympics. NBC then confirmed that the allegation stemmed from an incident during the Sochi Games. “My client is terrified and she does live in constant fear that people are going to track her down and figure out who she is,” Wilkenfeld said on Friday. NBC hasn’t done enough to protect his client’s identity, the lawyer said, even as there is a “hunt underway” to figure out her identity.“I can say that NBC has a duty to maintain confidentiality ... and they have not done a good job of doing that. They know exactly what they’ve done and they need to stop,” he said.Wilkenfeld suggested that the way his client is treated will have a lasting influence on whether other women come forward with sexual misconduct allegations in the future. “I think that’s going to have a chilling effect on other women who might want to come forward and tell their stories,” he said. “She’s been incredibly brave and she’s helped protect the other women at NBC.”Shortly after the first allegation became public, Variety published a scathing report that laid out multiple sexual misconduct accusations against Lauer. Lauer addressed the allegations in a statement read on “Today” last month. “There are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions,” Lauer’s statement read. “To the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. Some of what is being said about me is untrue or mischaracterized, but there is enough truth in these stories to make me feel embarrassed and ashamed.”"

The building, which dates back to the 14th century, is located on the grounds of Windsor Castle and has hosted many royal weddings and funerals over the years. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have chosen to get married there, and not just because of the venue’s prestige. They’re also reportedly drawn to the chapel because it’s a holy and sacred place. Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury and the head of England’s state church, said he had spoken to the couple and was “very, very sure” they didn’t decide to get married at a church just to check off something from a wedding to-do list. “This is no tick-box exercise,” Welby told BBC Radio 4′s Today program on Thursday. “There is a profound sense of commitment [and] seriousness, both about faith and about their lives together, which is quite inspirational.”The Church of England encourages clergy members to meet privately with an engaged couple to determine how committed they are to the marriage. If one of the partners is divorced, as Markle is, the clergy member typically asks questions about the circumstances of that divorce. It’s likely that Markle met with Welby or another church leader before the engagement was announced, experts say.Markle, who was raised as a Protestant, plans to be baptized and confirmed into the Church of England before the wedding. Welby said the royal wedding would be important because people watching it would “see a model of how two people commit their lives to one another before God in the presence of millions of people.” He also said he wasn’t sure he if would preside over the wedding, which the archbishop of Canterbury typically does. “That is up to them,” he said."

The former vice president spoke with Teen Vogue’s editor-in-chief Elaine Welteroth in an interview on Wednesday about how he could have handled the 1991 Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Clarence Thomas differently.Biden has been an outspoken advocate for women for decades: He helped pass the Violence Against Women Act in 1994 and, more recently, created the It’s On Us organization, which focuses on combating sexual violence on college campuses around the country.The 75-year-old, however, has been widely criticized for how he handled Hill when she testified against Thomas during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings in 1991. Many people believe Biden didn’t do enough to stand by Hill or shield her from attacks when she accused Thomas of sexual harassment. Biden told Teen Vogue that he voted against Thomas at the time because he believed Hill’s story.“I insisted the next election — I campaigned for two women Senators on the condition that if they won they would come on the Judiciary Committee, so there would never be again all men making a judgement on this,” he said. “And my one regret is that I wasn’t able to tone down the attacks on her by some of my Republican friends. I mean, they really went after her. As much as I tried to intervene, I did not have the power to gavel them out of order. I tried to be like a judge and only allow a question that would be relevant to ask.”The committee reported Thomas’ nomination to the Senate floor without a recommendation, and he was narrowly confirmed on a 52-48 vote.

The former vice president spoke with Teen Vogue’s editor-in-chief Elaine Welteroth in an interview on Wednesday about how he could have handled the 1991 Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Clarence Thomas differently.Biden has been an outspoken advocate for women for decades: He helped pass the Violence Against Women Act in 1994 and, more recently, created the It’s On Us organization, which focuses on combating sexual violence on college campuses around the country.The 75-year-old, however, has been widely criticized for how he handled Hill when she testified against Thomas during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings in 1991. Many people believe Biden didn’t do enough to stand by Hill or shield her from attacks when she accused Thomas of sexual harassment. Biden told Teen Vogue that he voted against Thomas at the time because he believed Hill’s story.“I insisted the next election — I campaigned for two women Senators on the condition that if they won they would come on the Judiciary Committee, so there would never be again all men making a judgement on this,” he said. “And my one regret is that I wasn’t able to tone down the attacks on her by some of my Republican friends. I mean, they really went after her. As much as I tried to intervene, I did not have the power to gavel them out of order. I tried to be like a judge and only allow a question that would be relevant to ask.”The committee reported Thomas’ nomination to the Senate floor without a recommendation, and he was narrowly confirmed on a 52-48 vote.
