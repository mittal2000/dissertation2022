I,2017-03-26,"<p>Dr. Travis Bradberry takes a closer look at 8 shortsighted rules that kill morale, with advice for how companies can do right by their employees.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d2be921400002900070f1b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Companies need to have rules—that’s a given—but they don’t have to be shortsighted and lazy attempts at creating order.I understand the temptation. As my company has grown, so has our difficulty maintaining standards. There have been many instances where someone crossed a line, and we were tempted to respond with a new rule that applied to everyone.But that’s where most companies blow it.In just about every instance, upon closer inspection, we realized that establishing a new rule would be a passive and morale-killing way to address the problem. The vast majority of the time, the problem needs to be handled one-on-one by the employee’s manager.When companies create ridiculous and demoralizing rules to halt the outlandish behavior of a few individuals, it’s a management problem. There’s no sense in alienating your entire workforce because you don’t know how to manage performance. It makes a bad situation that much worse.Here are some of the worst rules that companies create when they fall into this trap.1. Bell curves and forced rankings of performance. Some individual talents follow a natural bell-shaped curve, but job performance does not. When you force employees to fit into a pre-determined ranking system, you do three things: 1) incorrectly evaluate people’s performance, 2) make everyone feel like a number, and 3) create insecurity and dissatisfaction when performing employees fear that they’ll be fired due to the forced system. This is yet another example of a lazy policy that avoids the hard and necessary work of evaluating each individual objectively, based on his or her merits.2. Ridiculous requirements for attendance, leave, and time off. People are salaried for the work they do, not the specific hours they sit at their desks. When you ding salaried employees for showing up five minutes late even though they routinely stay late and put in time on the weekend, you send the message that policies take precedence over performance. It reeks of distrust, and you should never put someone on salary that you don’t trust.When companies are unnecessarily strict in requiring documentation for bereavement and medical leave, it leaves a sour taste in the mouths of employees who deserve better. After all, if you have employees who will fake a death to miss a day’s work, what does that say about your company?3. Restricting internet use. There are certain sites that no one should be visiting at work, and I’m not talking about Facebook. But once you block pornography and the other obvious stuff, it’s a difficult and arbitrary process deciding where to draw the line. Most companies draw it in the wrong place. People should be able to kill time on the Internet during breaks. When companies unnecessarily restrict people’s Internet activity, it does more than demoralize those that can’t check Facebook; it limits people’s ability to do their jobs. Many companies restrict Internet activity so heavily that it makes it difficult for people to do online research. The most obvious example? Checking the Facebook profile of someone you just interviewed.4. Banning mobile phones. If I ban mobile phones in the office, no one will waste time texting and talking to family and friends, right? Ya, right. Organizations need to do the difficult work of hiring people who are trustworthy and who won’t take advantage of things. They also need to train managers to deal effectively with employees who underperform and/or violate expectations (such as spending too much time on their phones). This is also hard work, but it’s worth it. The easy, knee-jerk alternative (banning phones) demoralizes good employees who need to check their phones periodically due to pressing family or health issues or as an appropriate break from work.5. Draconian e-mail policies. This is a newer one that’s already moving down a slippery slope. Some companies are getting so restrictive with e-mail use that employees must select from a list of pre-approved topics before the e-mail software will allow them to send a message. Again, it’s about trust. If you don’t trust your people to use e-mail properly, why did you hire them in the first place? In trying to rein in the bad guys, you make everyone miserable every time they send an e-mail. And guess what? The bad guys are the ones who will find ways to get around any system you put in place.6. Stealing employees’ frequent-flyer miles. If there’s one thing that road-weary traveling employees earn, it’s their frequent flier miles. When employers don’t let people keep their miles for personal use, it’s a greedy move that fuels resentment with every flight. Work travel is a major sacrifice of time, energy, and sanity. Taking employees’ miles sends the message that you don’t appreciate their sacrifice and that you’ll hold on to every last dollar at their expense.7. Pathetic attempts at political correctness. Maintaining high standards for how people treat each other is a wonderful thing as we live in a world that’s rife with animosity and discrimination. Still employers have to know where to draw the line. Going on a witch-hunt because someone says “Bless you” to another employee that sneezed (real example) creates an environment of paranoia and stifled self-expression, without improving how people treat each other.8. Shutting down self-expression (personal items and dress code). Many organizations control what people can have at their desks. A life-size poster of a shirtless Fabio? I get it; that’s a problem. But employers dictate how many photographs people can display, whether or not they can use a water bottle, and how many items they’re allowed to place on their desks. Once again, it’s the ol’ “If I could just hire robots I wouldn’t have this problem” approach.Same goes for dress codes. They work well in private high schools, but they’re unnecessary at work. Hire professionals and they’ll dress professionally. When someone crosses the line, their manager needs to have the skill to address the issue directly. Otherwise, you’re making everyone wish they worked somewhere else because management is too inept to handle touchy subjects effectively.Bringing It All TogetherIf companies can rethink their policies and remove or alter those that are unnecessary or demoralizing, we’ll all have a more enjoyable and productive time at work.What other policies drive you bananas? Please share your thoughts in the comments section, as I learn just as much from you as you do from me.Want to learn more? Enjoy my book Emotional Intelligence 2.0."
1,POLITICS,Republicans Swear They Will Keep Trying To Repeal Obamacare,"Michael McAuliff, Arthur Delaney, and Laura Barrón-López",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-keep-trying-repeal-obamacare_us_58d5a268e4b02a2eaab44c18,"Even though Paul Ryan says  he’s done with it, a party of Ahabs just can't let that Obamacare whale go.",2017-03-24,The easiest long-term strategy for Republicans would probably be to work with Democrats on Obamacare.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d5a3411400008806071781.jpeg?cache=qbQsFLalvM&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Republicans insisted, after their attempt to replace the Affordable Care Act suffered a humiliating public defeat, that they will someday make good on their seven-year promise to repeal Obamacare. Republicans had to pull their TrumpCare replacement bill from consideration on the House floor less than half an hour before it was due for a vote Friday because not enough of them liked their own bill.House Freedom Caucus conservatives hated it because it did not go far enough to dismantle Obamacare. More moderate members hated it because it would leave an additional 24 million Americans without health insurance and would especially hurt rural, older, white voters.House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) told reporters afterward that that’s it, he’s done, the country will have Obamacare for the “foreseeable future.”Yet, as unhappy-looking Republicans filed from an emergency caucus meeting in the basement of the Capitol on Friday afternoon just before Ryan spoke, they pledged to keep trying.“We didn’t have the votes, so we’re not going pull it up and just kill it. We’re going to keep working till we get something that does work,” said Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga).“This process doesn’t end just because this one bill’s been taken off the table,” said Rep. Bradley Byrne (R-Ala.). “It just shows that our first attempt didn’t work. This is not our last attempt. There will have to be other actions here.”Fresh on the heels of defeat, there was no consensus among Republicans on steps going forward. Do they try a piecemeal approach and whittle away at the Affordable Care Act? Do they go all in one more time? Do they heed Democrats’ calls to work with them on repairing parts of Obamacare that don’t work well?The most likely next move will be for Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price to tinker with the health care law’s implementation. Many Republicans have argued that the law will implode on its own and then Democrats will own the failure.But the recent Congressional Budget Office analysis of the current law found that it would be stable. To push the Affordable Care Act over the edge, Republicans might have to try to pass smaller bills that chip away at the law, although that will be difficult with only a narrow GOP majority in the Senate. Or they could prevail on Price to undermine enrollment, although administrative shenanigans could draw lawsuits.The easiest long-term strategy would probably be to work with Democrats, especially on the parts that moderates in both parties would back. Some Republicans said they would try to do that.No one really had a plan, though, and most of the lawmakers limping away like injured Capt. Ahabs on the way to get their peg legs were sure they had to keep chasing the Obamacare whale.“I introduced today a bill that would repeal Obamacare,” said Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.).“There’s a lot of things in American history that failed initially. Persistence is a really important principle,” said Rep. Andy Barr (R-Ky.), even as he pledged to work across the aisle.“The great movements in our country’s history have been built on persistence,” Barr said. “If you have an optimistic attitude about it, this is a learning experience. I want to learn from this experience, I hope my colleagues learn from this experience, and we try to do a better job building better consensus the next time around.”Indeed, there was a lot of taking the long view.“Sometimes these things, if you give ’em time to marinate, we’ll have an opportunity to bring us back together and allow us to regroup and get our mojo again,” said Rep. Steve Womack (R-Ark.).That mojo didn’t come back over the last seven years, however, and many Republicans are clearly frustrated.“Why can’t we do this ... when we have a Republican president?” asked Rep. Randy Weber (R-Texas) shortly before the bill went down. “It doesn’t make sense.”Jennifer Bendery contributed reporting"
2,POLITICS,Trump Is Relocating Immigration Judges To Speed Deportations. It May Not Work.,Roque Planas,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-relocating-immigration-judges_us_58d44d7fe4b02a2eaab213cd,"The White House says immigrants are abusing the court system, but judges may not agree.",2017-03-24,"The exterior of the Karnes County Residential Center, which was converted to a family detention center in 2014. Immigration judge Monica Little began hearing cases at the courtroom there on March 22, 2017, as part of an effort by the Trump administration to speed immigration proceedings.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d44dd31d0000cf3b7d0272.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"KARNES CITY, Texas ― President Donald Trump, whose administration argues that immigrants abuse the court system to delay deportation, dispatched immigration judges to the country’s two largest family detention centers this week so detainees’ cases can be processed more quickly. But experts ― and The Huffington Post’s visit to one of the centers ― suggest that the president may end up disappointed if he thinks relocating judges will speed up deportations. When Judge Monica Little, who normally presides over immigration court in Los Angeles, heard the first four cases under the new system on Wednesday at the Karnes County Residential Center in Texas, she issued rulings that gave the detainees before her weeks to find lawyers and collect evidence. That shouldn’t be surprising, according to Kathryn Mattingly, a spokeswoman for the Executive Office of Immigration Review, the branch of the Justice Department that handles deportation decisions. “Each case is individual and each judge will give the case due process,” she said. “The cases will all be heard the same way.” Little heard her first two cases at the Karnes facility by video conference call from the Karnes Correctional Center a few blocks away. The first man, from Senegal, had been detained since September, when he crossed into the United States through Hidalgo, Texas. Little said he could have three weeks to look for an attorney, insisting that officials at the detention center hand him a list of legal service providers while the video was still streaming. Immigrants facing deportation proceedings have a right to seek an attorney, but the government doesn’t guarantee them or pay for them like it does in criminal proceedings. Immigrants with lawyers are twice as likely to win relief as those without them, according to a study by the American Immigration Council. “The only thing I want to say is please help me,” the man said, speaking through an interpreter in Wolof. “I don’t want to go back home. I have issues over there. Please help me.” The lawyer for a Somali detainee, the second man Little heard by teleconference, had to call the court by phone because she hadn’t yet learned that the hearing would take place in Karnes City. Instead, she had gone to the immigration court in San Antonio, where the center’s hearings had previously been held. Little granted her a month to locate documents from Somalia. A Cuban woman and her daughter who had been detained since mid-January, shortly after then-President Barack Obama eliminated the so-called “wet foot-dry foot” policy, appeared in person and asked for a continuance so they could find a lawyer. Little set the hearing for March 31 to give them more time. A Central American woman appeared while her two children were in day care and asked the court to schedule her hearing for Thursday, when an attorney could be present. She requested a private hearing to discuss her claims.The judge reassignments were part of a larger effort by the Trump administration to focus immigration courts’ energy on ushering immigrant detainees through proceedings more quickly in order to free up bed space in the over-capacity detention system. His administration also sent judges to four other detention centers that house adults.But just because immigration judges have been moved to detention facilities doesn’t mean the outcomes will change, or even move much faster, Dana Leigh Marks, head of the National Association of Immigration Judges, told The Huffington Post. “There’s always pressure on the judges with detained cases to move as quickly as possible, without sacrificing due process,” Marks said. It’s too soon to say whether transferring the judges is an appropriate strategy to tackle the immigration courts’ notorious backlog, she added. But whatever benefit the Trump administration sees in expediting family detention cases should be weighed against the new costs, Marks cautioned.“You may be able to move a few of these cases a few weeks faster,” Marks said. “But at what price to the taxpayers, and at what price to the people on the overcrowded Los Angeles docket Judge Little left behind?”Handing down deportation orders faster also won’t necessarily stop cases from hitting roadblocks elsewhere, according to Stephen Legomsky, the former lead counsel for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. “Even if this move did increase the number of removal orders issued by immigration judges, it would just cause a further bottleneck at the Board of Immigration Appeals, unless the BIA’s membership and attorney support staff were similarly reinforced,” Legomsky wrote in an email to HuffPost. But the legal groups that represent women and children locked in family detention centers worry that the changes will undermine detainees’ rights. Their most immediate concern is that sending judges with marching orders to expedite proceedings might interfere with attempts to find lawyers, said Manoj Govindaiah, the head of family detention services for the legal services organization RAICES. Groups like his rely heavily on a limited number of pro bono attorneys to take family detention cases. The lack of paid attorneys causes scheduling problems that slow down the hearing process. “What we are really hoping to figure out is how amenable the judges will be to continue cases,” Govindaiah told HuffPost. “Typically, the San Antonio court has really been able to work with us to accommodate pro bono scheduling. But if the reason that these judges are all coming down in person is to expedite all these cases, then I don’t know how that’s going to play out.”Little’s receptiveness on Wednesday to continuing cases helped allay that concern somewhat. But legal groups are also alarmed that the Trump administration dispatched the visiting judges after chipping away at humanitarian relief for immigrants in other ways. For the last year and a half, most of the mothers and children locked in family detention who pass “credible fear” interviews ― the first step in applying for asylum in the U.S. ― have been released after three weeks. U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee ruled in 2015 that detaining kids longer than that violates the Flores Settlement, which says that children should generally be released and held in the least restrictive setting possible. The White House has sent signals that it wants to find a way around that ruling. The executive order the president signed on Jan. 25 to crack down on sanctuary cities declared a new policy of ending “the abuse of parole and asylum provisions currently used to prevent the lawful removal of removable aliens.” That’s an oblique reference to the flood of Central American asylum and humanitarian relief claims that first skyrocketed in 2014, leading the Obama administration to hastily expand family detention after all but abandoning it five years before.And last month, the Trump administration ordered asylum officers to narrow the criteria for approving “credible fear” claims. Failing a credible fear interview means that only ICE has the authority to release an immigrant from detention; a judge has no power to set a bond hearing unless the credible fear decision is reversed. “Everything is new,” Elena Alderman, the advocacy director for the legal services group CARA, told HuffPost. “We don’t know how this is going to be implemented. It’s a very confusing situation.” "

One day earlier, a lawyer associated with the family of a murdered Russian whistleblower was grievously injured after falling four stories from his Moscow apartment.The two cases have brought renewed questions about whether the Kremlin is violently targeting critics at home and abroad. In both incidents ― the murder of Denis Voronenkov in Kiev and Nikolai Gorokhov’s defenstration in Moscow ― Kremlin opponents were quick to claim that the Russian government played a nefarious role. Ukraine’s President Petro Poroshenko called Voronenkov’s killing a Russian “act of state terrorism,” while Gorokhov’s associate William Browder said the fall was “extremely suspicious” and raised the prospect of foul play. The impulse to suspect the Kremlin of being behind a political assassination doesn’t come as a surprise, given that opponents of Russian President Vladimir Putin have a well-established history of being fatally poisoned or dying unnatural deaths. But the rush to classify the incidents this week as part of a policy of targeted killings while the facts are still murky also highlights the level of suspicion surrounding Russia’s government.“Nowadays we’re in a situation where if anyone dies in Russia, or anyone of note who is a Russian [dies], immediately there will be claims that it is a hit,” said Mark Galeotti, a Russia expert at the Institute of International Relations Prague.These claims are often not unfounded, Galeotti notes. But because of the Russian government’s secrecy, history of alleged killings and increasingly aggressive foreign policy, a climate has also emerged where the Kremlin is immediately a prime suspect in such incidents.In Ukraine, where pro-Russian separatists are waging a conflict in the country’s east, these allegations are especially common. Ukraine’s government also blamed Russian involvement for an explosion at an ammunitions warehouse on Thursday.“It is clear that there is indeed Russian sabotage, there is indeed a Russian policy to put pressure on Ukraine by using violence and terrorist tactics, but not everything is necessarily down to that,” Galeotti said.Galeotti says it’s too soon to tell the motivation behind the killing of Voronenkov. The attacker ambushed Voronenkov with a pistol in front of the Premier Palace hotel while a Ukraine special forces bodyguard accompanied the former MP. The bodyguard shot and fatally wounded the assailant, who later died in the hospital ― giving authorities no chance to question him.Voronenkov had been receiving threats since he fled Russia last year along with his wife Maria Maksakova, amid an investigation alleging he was involved in property fraud ― a case he dismissed as politically motivated. In Ukraine, Voronenkov went from being a Putin supporter to a vocal opponent of his former government and president. He gave numerous interviews in which he made comparisons between Nazi Germany and contemporary Russia, or described Putin’s annexation of Crimea as illegal.Although this would seemingly make him a natural target for Russia, Voronenkov also drew criticism from Ukrainians and Russian opposition members who viewed his about-face as insincere. The Russian government, meanwhile, called allegations of its involvement in the murder “absurd.”The conflicting statements and details of Voronenkov’s killing have echoes of the incident involving Gorokhov the day before. Russian state media claimed that Gorokhov fell while trying to lift a bathtub up to his apartment, while his associate Browder wrote on Twitter that Gorokhov was “thrown from the top floor.” Gorokhov is the family lawyer of Sergei Magnitsky, who mysteriously died while in Moscow’s custody after accusing Russian law enforcement of committing fraud worth hundreds of millions of dollars.The opaque nature of these incidents means there’s rarely any immediate evidence or proof of whether the Kremlin was involved. Instead, the rapid reactions from governments and politicians show how heightened current tensions are surrounding Russia in international relations.“These [incidents] are all Rorschach ink blot tests. They tell you far more about your own expectations than what is in front of you,” Galeotti said.But given the long list of Kremlin critics who have been killed in recent years ― opposition politician Boris Nemtsov was shot and killed in 2015, for example, and former spy Alexander Litvinenko was poisoned a decade earlier ― it’s not surprising there is such heavy suspicion.CORRECTION: Due to an editorial error, this article incorrectly suggested that Nikolai Gorokhov had died from his injuries."

Palestinians want the West Bank and East Jerusalem for their own state, along with the Gaza Strip.Most countries consider Israeli settlements, built on land captured in the 1967 Middle East war, to be illegal. Israel disagrees, citing historical and political links to the land, as well as security interests.Trump has expressed some ambivalence about a two-state solution, the mainstay of U.S. policy for the past two decades. But he recently invited Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to visit.Trump has not publicly detailed what kind of agreement he wants with Israel on settlements. But many supporters of a two-state solution have urged a formula that restricts construction to the large settlement blocs that Israel is expected to retain under any final peace accord.In the talks, officials discussed measures for improving the climate for peace, according to the joint readout. It said a key focus was on steps that “could have a meaningful impact on the economic environment in the West Bank and Gaza,” and specifically a desire to advance efforts toward “self-sustainability” in electricity and water."

Speaking Friday at a climate conference hosted by the Heartland Institute, a conservative think tank, Ebell took issue with Tillerson voicing support for keeping the United States in the historic Paris climate agreement — a pact Trump has promised to withdraw the U.S. from.“Rex Tillerson thinks it’s really nice to be able to go to international meetings and pal around with his fellow foreign ministers,” he said. “Tillerson may be from Texas and he may have been CEO of Exxon, but he’s part of the swamp.”Ebell stopped just short of putting Trump’s elder daughter, Ivanka, and her husband, Jared Kushner, in the same category of “swamp creatures” the president had promised to chase out of Washington. “I’m sorry to say that we’ve heard that the president’s daughter and son-in-law also support staying in Paris,” he said. “I don’t know that they really want to be identified as swamp creatures, and I’m not going to do so. But I do think that at some point it needs to be pointed out to President Trump and his administration that the people who elected Donald J. Trump are not wealthy Manhattanites, including his children.” Ebell said he’s been impressed with Trump’s swift efforts to implement many of the promises he made on energy, climate and the environment. But he sees an ongoing problem. “Swamp creatures are still there,” Ebell said. “They are trying to infiltrate the administration, and some of them are succeeding.”Last week, the White House unveiled its preliminary skinny budget, which calls for deep cuts to climate and environmental programs, including slashing the EPA’s funding by 31 percent, from $8.2 billion to $5.7 billion. At Friday’s conference, Ebell called this a “huge” percentage that would require eliminating 3,200 out of 14,700 positions, drawing applause from the audience.“Remember, President Trump said during the campaign more than once that he hoped to abolish the agency, he’d like to abolish it,” Ebell said. “Well, 31 percent’s a good start, isn’t it?”Ebell has been vocal about his disgust for the environmental movement. In January, he described it as the “greatest threat to freedom and prosperity in the modern world.” Trump, who has dismissed climate change as “bullshit” and a Chinese “hoax,” pledged in May to pull the U.S. out of the historic Paris climate agreement ― a promise that didn’t sit well with hundreds of American businesses or many of the world’s leading scientists, including famed physicist Stephen Hawking."
7,POLITICS,Ted Cruz Called Donald Trump 'A Sniveling Coward' One Year Ago,Eliot Nelson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ted-cruz-called-donald-trump-a-sniveling-coward-one-year-ago_us_58d41fb8e4b0b22b0d1b0b58,You'll probably believe what happened next.,2017-03-24,"Ted Cruz, above, and Donald Trump had some sharp words during the 2016 primary campaign. It's unclear whether the feud is over.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d4207e14000020000712f1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As congressional Republicans mark the seventh anniversary of the Affordable Care Act by trying to repeal it, let us pause to reflect on a somewhat less auspicious anniversary. A year ago Friday, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) called Donald Trump a “sniveling coward.”To recap: In late March 2016, with the contentious Republican presidential primary in full swing, an anti-Trump super PAC ran an ad featuring images of a scantily clad Melania Trump from a 2000 photoshoot with the caption, “meet Melania Trump. Your next first lady. Or, you could support Ted Cruz on Tuesday.”Though the Cruz campaign was not involved with the ad, Trump responded by threatening to “spill the beans” about Cruz’s wife, Heidi. “The beans,” it turned out, was a meme courtesy of someone with the Twitter handle @Don_Vito_08.Because presidential campaigns aren’t typically occasions for diss battles, Trump’s retweet ate up the news cycle, prompting condemnations from Trump opponents and yet another round of handwringing from Republicans. Even considering Cruz’s distinctly melodramatic manner of public speaking ― few politicians more closely resemble a particularly self-absorbed debate club kid ― his response was intense. “It’s not easy to tick me off. I don’t get angry often,” an incensed Cruz told reporters. “But you mess with my wife, you mess with my kids, that will do it every time. Donald, you’re a sniveling coward, and leave Heidi the hell alone.”When a reporter asked Cruz if he would support Trump if the real estate mogul and reality TV star were the Republican Party’s presidential nominee, Cruz hesitated before replying, “I’m going to beat him for the nomination. Donald Trump will not be the nominee.”He did not beat him. Donald Trump was the nominee. Ted Cruz endorsed him.Cruz’s office did not return requests for comment for this story.Things remained toxic between Cruz and Trump for the remainder of the primary and well after, with Trump regularly referring to Cruz as “Lyin’ Ted” and Cruz leveling broadsides against Trump’s character. In one speech before Cruz dropped out, he called his opponent a “pathological liar,” a “narcissist” and a “philanderer.” After footage emerged of Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women, Cruz called the comments “disturbing and inappropriate” in a tweet. And, in what was arguably the strangest accusation leveled by Trump since his highly publicized (and highly untrue) birther campaign, he accused Cruz’s father, Rafael, of playing a part in John F. Kennedy’s assassination.He repeated the accusation a day after accepting the nomination at the GOP convention in Cleveland. Party unity can be a strange thing.In early October, the Dallas Morning News published video of Cruz phone-banking for the man who had disrespected his wife, implicated his father in a violent act of treason and seemed only one late-night tweet away from elevating the “Ted Cruz is the Zodiac Killer” meme from online joke to full-fledged conspiracy theory. The footage went viral: Cruz looked less like a happy warrior putting party before ego and more like a scared teenager calling his mom to pick him up from a particularly raucous house party. Trump, for his part, has tried to make amends with Cruz since taking office. In addition to having the Cruzes over to the White House for dinner, Trump invited the senator to the Oval Office for the signing of a NASA authorization bill. And in an interview with Time magazine published this week, Trump insisted, “I like Ted Cruz, he’s a friend of mine.”But it’s not clear whether Trump is totally over his feud with Cruz. In the Time interview, he doubled ― nay, tripled ― down on the JFK claim, insisting it was something “that was in the newspaper.”Moreover, Trump, who has made a point of regularly deleting tweets, still has not deleted the one making fun of Heidi Cruz’s appearance. And during that NASA authorization bill signing, the president, ostensibly discussing the space agency’s work, said, “It’s a pretty tough job, I dunno. Ted, would you like to do it?” Cruz, his fingers resting gently on the Resolute Desk, smiled knowingly as Trump asked Marco Rubio, another former primary foe, the same question.

8,POLITICS,Trump's Immigration Policies Have Become A Flashpoint,Ariel Edwards-Levy and Grace Sparks,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trumps-immigration-policies-have-become-a-flashpoint_us_58d50dd7e4b03787d3572bb3,"Americans can't decide if it's the issue he's done the worst job handling, or the best.",2017-03-24,"FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump signs a travel ban executive order at the Pentagon in Washington, U.S., January 27, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d510941d0000f42c7d03e6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Americans have strong opinions about President Trump’s immigration actions, but they’re more personally concerned about their health care. The GOP’s Obamacare repeal act is eclipsing Obamacare in unpopularity. And Democrats are more likely than Republicans to trust government data. This is HuffPollster for Friday, March 24, 2017.TRUMP’S FIRST MONTHS HAVE FOCUSED ON IMMIGRATION, MOST AMERICANS SAY - HuffPollster: “Sixty-two percent of Americans say that immigration is among the two issues Trump has spent the most time on since taking office, with 37 percent naming health care and just 19 percent saying the economy. For once, opinions vary relatively little across political lines, with 70 percent of Clinton voters and 63 percent of Trump voters saying that immigration has been at the center of the president’s actions. Responses to those actions, however, are deeply divided. Asked to rate the two issues Trump has done the best and worst job of handling, regardless of how they feel about his job performance overall, 26 percent call immigration one of the topics he’s done the best job of addressing, with 25 percent saying it’s among the worst....Trump voters give the president the highest marks on immigration...The majority of Clinton voters, 69 percent, are unwilling to credit Trump with performing well on anything, instead saying they’re unsure. But they single out immigration and health care as issues on which they’re especially disappointed.”  [HuffPost] Health care now Americans’ top concern - More from the HuffPost/YouGov survey: “Forty-five percent of those polled name health care as among the two issues most important to them, with 39 percent naming the economy, the survey finds. Immigration, at 25 percent, takes a relatively distant third. The results mark a dramatic and unusual shift that comes in tandem with the unpopular rollout of Republicans’ new health care bill and an upswing in popularity for the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. While economic anxiety has ebbed in the aftermath of the recession, the economy has remained the nation’s near-perennial top issue, with the 2016 campaign no exception. Last November, Americans were 14 points likelier to name the economy than health care as one of their top election concerns.”AHCA IS LESS POPULAR THAN OBAMACARE EVER WAS - HuffPollster: “President Barack Obama’s health care law hasn’t always been beloved by the public. But it’s never been as unpopular as the Republican bill now intended to destroy it, according to the latest polling. When the Affordable Care Act was signed in March 2010, after months of debate, about 42 percent of the public approved, according to HuffPost Pollster’s aggregate, with about 50 percent disapproving ― a level of discontent that proved to be bad news for Democrats and for Obama. At the law’s lowest ebb, in 2013, support fell to about 38 percent. That level of support, however, seems downright robust in comparison with the pessimism that’s greeted the Republican bill, known as the American Health Care Act. Reactions to the proposal have been overwhelmingly negative, with most surveys finding less than one-third of the public in favor of the bill. Support reached a new nadir Thursday in a Quinnipiac poll, which found just 17 percent of voters expressing approval, and only 6 percent approving strongly.” [HuffPost]More of the latest on health care:-Quinnipiac: “American voters disapprove 56 - 17 percent, with 26 percent undecided, of the Republican health care plan to replace Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released today. Support among Republicans is a lackluster 41 - 24 percent.” -Morning Consult: “A strong plurality of voters think congressional Republicans are moving too quickly to overhaul the nation’s health care system, according to a new Morning Consult/POLITICO poll, which also shows that Obamacare is more popular than the GOP alternative.” -538’s Nate Silver: “I estimate that there are only about 80 congressional districts — out of 435 — where support for the bill exceeds opposition. About two-thirds of Republican members of the House, in fact, likely come from districts where the plurality of voters oppose the bill.”-NYT’s Nate Cohn: “[T]he health care debate is splitting House Republicans along ideological lines, with few signs that members are being pulled off familiar terrain by the effect of the law on their states or districts….What do the opponents of the House bill seem to have in common? They represent competing ideological factions with predictable reservations about the Republican plan, regardless of whether their districts or constituents are posed to be disproportionately affected.”-Pew Research’s Samantha Smith: “With the U.S. House preparing to vote on a proposal to repeal and replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act, Republicans continue to overwhelmingly oppose the law, and most say it’s not the government’s responsibility to make sure all Americans have health care coverage. But the views of lower-income Republicans stand out: They are somewhat more likely than higher-income Republicans to support the health care law, and many say it is the government’s responsibility to ensure that all Americans have coverage.”-Marquette University, on a poll of Wisconsin: “Opinion of the 2010 health reform law varies depending on whether it is described as ‘the Affordable Care Act’ or as ‘Obamacare.’...When it was described as ‘the Affordable Care Act,’ 51 percent said they have a favorable view of the law while 40 percent have an unfavorable view and 9 percent said they don’t know. When the law was described as ‘Obamacare,’ 40 percent reported a favorable view, with 53 percent unfavorable and 6 percent lacking an opinion.” FAITH IN GOVERNMENT STATISTICS SPLITS ALONG PARTISAN LINES - Kathy Frankovic “[Partisanship] plays a role in how people view the output of the CBO and other agencies that provide important government statistics, such as the jobless rate and the Census count. Many Americans pick and choose the statistics they believe, with Republicans generally more skeptical. But while public skepticism takes on a partisan tinge on health care reform, Democrats and Republicans have similar reactions to some other government statistics. A majority of Democrats think all or most government statistics are reliable, but fewer than half as many Republicans agree. 42% of Republicans believe few or no statistics put out by the government….Republicans don’t believe as many people will lose health coverage under the AHCA as the CBO says; Democrats think there will be an even greater loss of coverage….But both Democrats and Republicans quarrel with other government statistics: pluralities in both parties say the Census Bureau undercounted Americans in 2010, and there are many who think the Bureau of Labor Statistics underreports joblessness.” [YouGov]AT LEAST AMERICANS CAN AGREE ON HOW DIVIDED WE ARE - Monmouth University: “Fully three-quarters (75%) of the nation feel that Americans are greatly divided when it comes to our most important values. This number is up slightly from 70% who said the same last year, with widespread agreement across all demographic groups. Only 22% believe that Americans are united and in agreement about our core principles...Only 11% say the country has actually become more united and 34% say not much has changed since Trump entered the White House. Those who say the country has become more divided since Trump’s inauguration include 71% of Democrats, 50% of independents, and 35% of Republicans. Only 16% of Republicans think the country has become more united under Trump, which is not significantly different from the 10% of independents and 7% of Democrats who feel the same.” [Monmouth]HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!

10,POLITICS,Obamacare Repeal Would Knock 10 Percent Of This State Off Health Insurance,Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obamacare-repeal-oregon-kate-brown_us_58d52104e4b03692bea4ba01,"""It just creates a nightmare,"" says Oregon Gov. Kate Brown (D).",2017-03-24,"Oregon Gov. Kate Brown said Thursday that repealing the Affordable Care Act is the ""wrong direction"" for her state.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d5215d1d0000cf3b7d0407.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― There are a lot of things Oregon Gov. Kate Brown (D) doesn’t like about Republicans’ Obamacare repeal bill. It significantly raises costs on seniors. It kills the requirement that insurance companies offer maternity care and mental health care as essential health benefits.But there’s one particularly staggering effect that repealing the Affordable Care Act would have on her state: As many as 475,000 people would lose their health insurance. That’s more than 10 percent of Oregon’s population.“It just creates a nightmare,” Brown said in a Thursday interview with The Huffington Post.As many as 40,000 Oregonians would lose their jobs as a result of repeal, as those jobs were created as a result of more people participating in health insurance. That’s according to the Economic Policy Institute, which offers a state-by-state breakdown of the effects of Obamacare repeal.The governor said she’s been hearing from rural health care providers around her state who are worried about the effects of the GOP’s repeal bill on their populations seeking drug treatment. The legislation ends the requirement for insurance companies to offer the treatment, which means thousands of people in Oregon would lose it, Brown said.“These are, generally speaking, people suffering from opioid addictions,” she said.The only lawmaker in the Oregon congressional delegation supporting the repeal bill is Rep. Greg Walden (R), who is also the state’s only GOP congressman. His office did not respond to a request for comment about all the people who would lose health insurance in his state.Walden, who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee, has played a pivotal role in shaping the repeal bill. During a Friday morning committee hearing, he said Republicans amended the bill late Thursday to dedicate $15 billion to a new fund to help states pay for essential health benefits, like substance abuse treatment. That flexibility for states, he argued, is the better option, rather than requiring insurance companies to cover all essential health benefits.“I’m proud of the product,” Walden told the Rules Committee, which met hours before the House is set to vote on the bill.Brown disagreed that the GOP’s proposal, which would ultimately kick 24 million Americans off of health insurance and offer roughly $200 billion in tax cuts to the wealthy, is a good thing.“I think it is the wrong direction for Oregon,” she said. “Ninety-eight percent of children are covered. Ninety-five percent of adults are covered. We want to move forward, not backward.”"
11,POLITICS,Trump Worked A Few Weeks On Health Care. White House Claims He Gave It 'His All.',Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-health-care-tries_us_58d55f7be4b03787d3582f55,"If at first you don't succeed, give up.",2017-03-24,"On Sept. 9, 2009, President Barack Obama delivered a speech on health care before a joint session of Congress.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d588b01400008806071748.jpeg?ops=crop_7_129_3493_2071%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The White House desperately tried to spin the looming failure of the GOP health care bill Friday afternoon, insisting that if it went down, it wouldn’t be the president’s fault because he put “his all” into it. “When you look at legislative efforts, I think the president has given it his all,” White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters Friday. “And I think it shocked a lot of people, frankly, how very, very detail-oriented, how personal it was for him ― calling members, you know, as early as 6 in the morning and going to 11 at night the last several nights, sitting down meeting after meeting with them, coming back and revising it, having his team back and forth.”Spicer added that Trump “used every minute of every day that’s possible to get this thing through” and “left everything on the field.” Trump has been in office for about two months. On March 6, Republicans introduced the American Health Care Act, their attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare after seven years of promising voters they would do just that. On Friday, that dream died, at least for now. Trump told The Washington Post Friday afternoon that instead of moving forward with what appeared to be a doomed vote, he had asked House GOP leaders to pull the legislation. He told The New York Times that he was pleased with his effort and wanted to just be done with it. The move was a stunning defeat for a man Spicer called “the closer” and who has made his negotiating skills a central part of his persona. The health care system and the politics of Washington seem to have gotten the best of Trump. In late February, as Republicans were coming up with their legislation, he seemed to acknowledge that he may be getting in over his head: “Nobody knew health care could be so complicated.” There was, however, someone who knew: President Barack Obama. Health care was a major part of the 2008 campaign, including the Democratic primary. Obama first introduced his health care plan in May 2007, offering specific ideas on how to reform the system. While Trump campaigned on repealing Obamacare, he never offered his own plan with specific replacements.In March 2009, Obama convened a summit at the White House, bringing together 120 representatives from the health care industry, along with members of Congress, to discuss ways to reform the system.The Affordable Care Act was introduced in Congress on Sept. 17, 2009, and Obama signed it into law on March 23, 2010. During that time, Obama made health care reform his top priority, often facing criticism for expending so much time and political capital on the issue. There was a speech to Congress, visits to caucus meetings, calls with members, events across the country and outreach to local communities to explain the process. Obama and his aides traveled around the country promoting the legislation, even as conservative activists were coming out in the summer of 2010 for the famous tea party protests. “I remember driving in a small van with [HHS Secretary] Kathleen Sebelius from Portland, Maine, to Bangor, Maine, because I think there was one television station that was based in Bangor, and we wanted to do an event there to reach that portion of the state of Maine and communicate with as many people as we possibly could. It was literally a no-stone-left-unturned kind of operation,” recalled Nick Papas, who worked in the Office of Health Reform at the Department of Health and Human Services from the beginning of the administration until the Affordable Care Act passed. In February 2010, Obama brought lawmakers ― both Democrats and Republicans ― to Blair House for a seven-hour summit in an attempt to get bipartisan support for the legislation. Top Democrats, meanwhile, said Trump never reached out to them at all for their support on the American Health Care Act. “The president believed that this was incredibly important and the health and lives of millions of people were at stake,” Papas said of Obama. “It was a worthwhile investment of time and energy because it’s a piece of legislation that has literally saved people’s lives.”Trump did bring GOP lawmakers to the White House in a last-minute attempt to figure out what changes would get them to support the bill, and he also went up to Capitol Hill to rally support. But he never gave a major speech on health care reform, nor did he barnstorm the country to get support. And in the end, he spent just a few weeks before giving up on what was supposed to be the GOP’s biggest priority.“I think there’s nobody that objectively can look at this effort and say the president didn’t do every single thing he possibly could with his team to get every vote possible,” Spicer added Friday. “And I think that’s why, you know, I still feel good about this.”Want more updates from Amanda Terkel?

San Francisco police announced Thursday that they had arrested Joshua Ruano, 27, for allegedly threatening to shoot a woman wearing a hijab on March 17. Ruano allegedly approached the woman, who was playing with her child in a park, and made anti-Muslim remarks. (A police spokeswoman wouldn’t elaborate on those remarks.) He then threatened to shoot her, according to police.The woman and her child fled the park and contacted police. Ruano was arrested a short time later. A spokesman for the San Francisco district attorney’s office confirmed that Ruano was arraigned this week on charges of making criminal threats with a hate crime enhancement, and other unrelated crimes.On March 21 in Charlotte, North Carolina, a Muslim woman wearing a hijab and an abaya says she was breastfeeding her 1-month-old baby in a parking lot when a man in a pickup truck pulled up next to her car, according to The Charlotte Observer.The woman says the man stared at her for several minutes before taking out a long rifle and pointing the barrel directly at her. “‘I’m not going to sit here and let him shoot me,’” the woman recalled thinking. She clutched her baby and ran inside a store. The man ― white and balding, in his 40s or 50s, she said ― sped away. “We ask law enforcement authorities to use all resources available to apprehend the alleged perpetrator and to bring all appropriate charges, including that of ethnic intimidation,” Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said in a statement this week. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.The two sets of horrifying allegations come amid an apparent surge in such hate crimes across the country.In recent months, America has seen the fatal stabbing of a black man in New York City by a white supremacist; the shooting of two Indian men in Kansas, one of whom died; the shooting of a Sikh man in Washington; the burning of at least four mosques; the vandalism of gravestones in Jewish cemeteries; and the destruction of Qurans in an Arizona mosque and a New Mexico library. There have also been more than 100 bomb threats against Jewish community centers, synagogues and Anti-Defamation League offices across the country; instances of racist graffiti in Connecticut and Oregon; assaults of Latinos in California and New York; and the killings of at least seven transgender women of color. The list goes on. The Southern Poverty Law Center tracked more than 1,000 bias-related incidents in the month after the Nov. 8 election, a surge they attributed to the hateful speech of President Donald Trump. The SPLC stated that in some 37 percent of those incidents, the perpetrators directly referenced the president, his campaign slogans or his comments about sexual assault. Earlier this month, more than 150 civil rights groups ― including the SPLC, Amnesty International, the Anti-Defamation League, the NAACP, Muslim Advocates and the National Bar Association ― signed an open letter accusing the president of fostering an atmosphere of hate and being to slow to condemn hate crimes when they happen. Hate crime data in the U.S. is woefully inadequate. The FBI counted 5,479 hate crimes in 2015 ― a 7 percent increase from the year before, driven largely by a 67 percent increase in anti-Muslim hate crimes ― but another government report estimates that number to be much higher. A survey by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics found that the number of hate crimes in America each year probably approaches a staggering 260,000 ― or about one every two minutes.The disparity between the FBI’s figures and the BJS’ estimation exists largely because police departments in the U.S. aren’t required to report hate crimes to the FBI, and many hate crimes go unreported to police in the first place.That’s why The Huffington Post has partnered with ProPublica, a nonprofit news organization dedicated to investigative journalism, and with other news outlets to help make a national database of reported acts of hate and bias. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story mistakenly described the fatal stabbing of a black man in New York City as a fatal shooting.America does not do a good job of tracking incidents of hate and bias. We need your help to create a database of such incidents across the country, so we all know what’s going on. Tell us your story."

Earlier this month, more than 150 civil rights groups ― including the SPLC, Amnesty International, the Anti-Defamation League, the NAACP, Muslim Advocates and the National Bar Association ― signed an open letter accusing the president of fostering an atmosphere of hate and being to slow to condemn hate crimes when they happen. Hate crime data in the U.S. is woefully inadequate. The FBI counted 5,479 hate crimes in 2015 ― a 7 percent increase from the year before, driven largely by a 67 percent increase in anti-Muslim hate crimes ― but another government report estimates that number to be much higher. A survey by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics found that the number of hate crimes in America each year probably approaches a staggering 260,000 ― or about one every two minutes.The disparity between the FBI’s figures and the BJS’ estimation exists largely because police departments in the U.S. aren’t required to report hate crimes to the FBI, and many hate crimes go unreported to police in the first place.That’s why The Huffington Post has partnered with ProPublica, a nonprofit news organization dedicated to investigative journalism, and with other news outlets to help make a national database of reported acts of hate and bias. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story mistakenly described the fatal stabbing of a black man in New York City as a fatal shooting.America does not do a good job of tracking incidents of hate and bias. We need your help to create a database of such incidents across the country, so we all know what’s going on. Tell us your story."

Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trumpcare-reality-obama_us_58d58ccfe4b03787d358b9de,Republicans promised a health care plan that would be cheaper but better than Obamacare. Turns out that’s a lot harder than they figured.,2017-03-24,President Donald Trump reacts to the AHCA health care bill being pulled by Congressional Republicans before a vote as he speaks about the bill in the Oval Office on Friday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d58d562c00002000ff0587.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― As the dust settles from Friday’s collapse of “Trumpcare” in the House of Representatives and fingers try to point out the various losers, at least one clear winner has emerged: facts.As in: the realities of the health insurance market, and their resistance to conform to promises made on the campaign trail.In 2009, President Barack Obama was criticized for failing to schmooze lawmakers sufficiently ― for being an imperious technocrat when the situation called for a glad-handing salesman.Eight years later, Republicans had precisely that in President Donald Trump ― a self-described dealmaker who neither knew nor cared about the details of health care, but who promised a “terrific” plan to replace “the disaster” of Obamacare by dint of his personality alone.After fast-tracking a proposal to repeal the Affordable Care Act as the first major legislative item on the agenda of a unified, all-Republican government, Trump and House speaker Paul Ryan pulled their “American Health Care Act” just minutes before a scheduled vote. Too many Republicans ― dozens, both conservative Freedom Caucus members as well as moderates ― were prepared to vote against it.“That is the growing pains of being a governing party,” Ryan said later.Trump, characteristically, blamed Democrats for not supporting him and declined to discuss any specifics in his own legislation. Asked about what lessons he learned from the episode, Trump answered: “We learned a lot about loyalty. And we learned a lot about the vote-getting process.”But Trump’s and Ryan’s problems go beyond whipping votes among fellow Republicans. Because for all the bashing Republicans have given the Affordable Care Act as government overreach and “socialized medicine,” Obama’s signature health care law was built upon a Republican, market-based foundation.Its core principles were dreamed up in a conservative think tank in the 1990s as a way to counter the far more sweeping health-care plan pushed by President Bill Clinton. A version of it was implemented a decade later in Massachusetts under Republican Gov. Mitt Romney.This, in fact, was the reason so many liberal Democrats were infuriated with Obama in 2009 for proposing a GOP plan to start with, rather than a single-payer scheme like they preferred. Obama, having started with a plan he believed Republicans should have been eager to support, grew frustrated when GOP leaders instead decided to oppose it unanimously and characterize it as a typical liberal entitlement.Yet Obama’s negotiating strategy, or lack of one, notwithstanding, the ACA in the end was designed to deliver health care using the existing model of private insurance using government subsidies for premiums. The much-derided “individual mandate” to purchase health insurance would not have been necessary had Democrats gone with a “Medicare for all” proposal, but was crucial under the ACA to hold down premiums by spreading the costs of serious illnesses across a wider base.Republicans who have claimed for seven years that they could replace the law with something that would eliminate the mandate yet cost less and provide better health care ― Trump went so far as to promise coverage to everyone ― are quickly getting a lesson in reality.Chief among them: Trump himself, who explained something new he had learned ― that making one change in one part of the law has consequences in other parts of the law. “Nobody knew that health care could be so complicated,” Trump said last month.When House Republicans and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price came up with their plan, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office found that it would cause 26 million to lose insurance compared to the ACA, with premiums skyrocketing particularly for the elderly just below the eligibility age for Medicare.Several rounds of tweaks designed to pull in factions of unhappy Republicans later, House Speaker Paul Ryan was on the brink of forcing the members of his majority to vote on legislation that would let states eliminate “essential health benefits” from policies. That move to assuage his most conservative members was not at all palatable to moderates worried about their constituents ― that is, voters ― losing coverage entirely.In other words: When the unaccountable language of political campaigns ran up into the facts of the real world, the facts won. At least for now."

Alcee Hastings (D-Fla.) challenged Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.) on the health care bill’s dramatic cuts to Medicaid during a hearing in the House Rules Committee. “Tell me about the $800 billion that’s being taken out of Medicaid,” Hastings said to Walden. “When, in fact, all we had to do was leave the taxes that are here for very wealthy people.”Hastings pointed to 400 extremely wealthy households that stand to get a substantial tax break if the Affordable Care Act is repealed.“Do you not see how that affects Medicaid?” he asked Walden.“Okay, I’m going to try to bring the tone down here,” Walden said. “I’m not going to bring my tone down,” Hastings replied. “I’m mad as hell about what you all are doing and I don’t have to be nice to nobody when you’re being nasty to poor people.”An estimate by the Congressional Budget Office released this month found that 24 million people stand to lose their coverage under the GOP bill. The measure would significantly reduce Medicaid enrollment, and slash funding for the low-income health care program by $880 billion.The Rules Committee later voted to advance the bill. The bill was later pulled before it could come up for a vote in the full House.This post has been updated to reflect the bill being pulled."
16,POLITICS,Donald Trump Is Making Air Travel Even More Miserable,Hayley Miller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-air-travel_us_58d52802e4b03692bea4cf26,"New ""extreme vetting"" rules, a headache for many travelers, could be costly for U.S. tourism.",2017-03-24,Secretary of State Rex Tillerson at the State Department in Washington on March 23.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d582a62c00002000ff0568.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The often frustrating process of air travel stands to become even more difficult for many people under President Donald Trump’s administration, and the hassles could take a major toll on the U.S. travel industry.Acquiring a U.S. visa is already an extensive process for most non-U.S. citizens, taking months or even years. But Trump’s recent directives, including an electronics ban and a stricter visa application process, signal a push for “extreme vetting” measures likely to increase hassles for non-U.S. citizens traveling to the United States.Secretary of State Rex Tillerson this month directed U.S. embassies to toughen visa screenings for “populations warranting increased scrutiny.” The order was issued in coordination with Trump’s second executive order on immigration and travel, which has been temporarily blocked by federal courts.The move could complicate an already bureaucratic visa process and cost the country’s tourism industry millions of dollars, some experts say, because additional security measures could significantly delay visa approvals and discourage travel to the U.S.Under the new rules, U.S.-bound travelers are subject to detailed background checks, as well a review of their social media history if they’ve ever been to a territory controlled by the self-proclaimed Islamic State. Embassy officials are seeking approval from the White House Office of Management and Budget to ask applicants for a 15-year history of where they have lived, worked and traveled.If applicants are unable to provide all of the required information, embassy officials could delay or reschedule the interview process. While there are valid reasons travelers could be denied a U.S. visa, some advocates worry people may be profiled for extra scrutiny because of their name or nationality, The New York Times reports.The Trump administration did not publicly announce the new visa screening measures, which were sent to embassies March 15 to March 17. Reuters first published a story on the new rules Thursday after reviewing copies of the cables between Tillerson and embassy officials.Mira Ghaziri, 30, who is from Beirut and works in Dubai as PepsiCo’s nutrition manager for the Middle East and North Africa, began traveling to the U.S. on business last year. She said she fears innocuous social media posts could unfairly impact Middle Eastern travelers.“In the Middle East, politics is such a daily topic” and everyone makes “a political statement on social media,” Ghaziri told The Huffington Post on Friday. “But this by no means will translate to action or be considered as a threat, since it’s just an opinion.”Ghaziri said working for an American company has made it easier to get a visa, though the immigration process at U.S. airports can take longer because of her nationality.Applying “the needed scrutiny before anyone enters the country is common sense,” Ghaziri said, “but there should be a standard way to do it across all nationalities and religions.”Tillerson acknowledged that stricter screenings could cause “backlogs to rise,” and recommended that officials interview no more than 120 applicants per day.Greg Chen, the director for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, told The New York Times that the the new rules could “impose a substantial burden” on applicants.“It will make it much harder and create substantial delays,” Chen said.Jonathan Grella, the executive vice president of public affairs for the U.S. Travel Association, said a “painful” customs process could deter tourists from choosing the U.S. as a travel destination. “We’re very much pro-security, but are concerned that the actual overt or deliberate welcome to America is viewed as soft when in fact it’s very real because the economic fallout could be considerable,” Grella told HuffPost. “The security blinders are tempting ... but that, obviously, comes at a risk.”Grella said his organization hopes Trump will send a message to the world that “legitimate tourists” are still very much welcome.It’s “naive to think, ‘We’re America and of course people will come here, and it if it’s a few less so be it. We’ve got security to tend to,’” Grella said. “That argument is flawed because that’s leaving money on the table needlessly.”Trump’s first executive order on immigration and travel cost the U.S. at least $185 million business travel bookings, according to a February report from the Global Business Travel Association, which represents corporate travel managers.“There was too much uncertainty and a lack of clarity around the executive order, leading to general confusion,” the association wrote in a blog post. “The net effect was that business travel bookings were delayed or canceled.”Travelers flying direct to the U.S. from 10 airports in Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates have also been hit with more restrictions.Experts say the Department of Homeland Security’s decision to ban electronics larger than cellphones was likely based on legitimate threats, but it’s another layer of added stress to some travelers.“I am a researcher, and, just like journalists, we carry data in our laptops,” Banu Akdenizli, an associate professor of communication at Northwestern University in Qatar, told HuffPost. “Checking that data in with luggage is a liability. What if it gets lost or stolen?”Grella said he hopes Trump’s competitive nature will encourage him to “soothe” the concerns of apprehensive U.S.-bound travelers for the sake of the American economy.“It does not cost a thing stylistically or substantively to say terror is not welcome, but legitimate tourists are,” Grella said. “We are open for business still, but closed to terror.”How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

17,MEDIA,Pro-Trump Media Get Their Wish As The Health Care Bill Is Pulled,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-paul-ryan-conservative-media_us_58d55e79e4b03692bea58d6f,And Speaker Paul Ryan gets all the blame.,2017-03-24,"It's not President Trump's fault, conservative media said.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d5823c1d0000f42c7d060a.jpeg?cache=J7VpH9yB55&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Just before 3 p.m. Friday, conservative radio host Laura Ingraham threw a request out into the Twitter ether: “#PullThe Bill.”She got her wish 39 minutes later as news broke that President Donald Trump and GOP House leaders had pulled the beleaguered health care bill after it became clear that enough conservative lawmakers opposed the legislation to sink its chances.Republican lawmakers who defy a Republican president’s wishes by opposing his first major piece of legislation might normally fear the wrath of conservative media calling for their heads in the next midterm elections.But those representatives who resisted Trump’s personal appeals to support the American Health Care Act shouldn’t fear any broadsides from the right, let alone the type of conservative media backlash that helped topple the House majority leader a few years back. That’s because several of the right’s most influential voices lined up against the bill, too. Following Friday’s stunning legislative setback, some Republican lawmakers suggested that conservative media and prominent groups opposing the bill, like the Heritage Foundation and Club for Growth, didn’t influence their own positions. Still, the decision to go against Trump presumably went down easier knowing that doing so wouldn’t antagonize his fiercest defenders. And some lawmakers acknowledged that conservative media played a role in the outcome. Rep. Morgan Griffith (R-Va.), a House Freedom Caucus member who had planned to vote for the bill, said pushback from conservative media outlets, like Breitbart, “certainly didn’t help” the legislative process. “But I think they’ve electrified it,” Griffith added. “They did point out some legitimate flaws as well, some of which were able to be fixed. But on the other side of the coin, we need to get Obamacare repealed at some point and the question is can we do it now.”Breitbart News led the charge online and served as a key platform for Republican critics of the bill that the site alternately dubbed “Obamacare Lite,” “Obamacare 2.0,” “RINO-Care,” and “RyanCare.” There was also a steady negative drumbeat on Breitbart’s Sirius radio show, with several lawmakers opposed to the bill making their case there. “This is worse than Obamacare,” Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) said Wednesday. On Friday morning, Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) declared that “Obamacare 2.0 is the largest Republican welfare program in the history of the Republican Party.”Much of the conservative opposition to the American Health Care Act ― which was projected to result in 24 million more uninsured Americans ― stemmed from its failure to eliminate an Obamacare provision guaranteeing coverage for “essential health benefits,” such as emergency services, prescription drugs, and pregnancy, newborn and maternity care. Republicans have argued that mandating such coverage drives up insurance premiums across the board. Breitbart and other media voices typically in Trump’s corner walked a fine line in opposing the White House’s stated goal of passing the health care bill while laying all the blame for the debacle on House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.).  The influential Drudge Report, which had been largely sitting out the debate, more recently framed the health care fallout around Ryan’s missteps. Fox News host Sean Hannity and conservative provocateur Ann Coulter, two of the president’s biggest boosters, argued Thursday night on Fox News that the mess on Capitol Hill wasn’t the president’s fault. Coulter suggested to Fox News host Tucker Carlson that Trump was putting “Ryan’s priorities” ahead of those he had advocated for during the campaign. As a result, she vowed to “not hold the Emperor God Trump responsible for this Obamacare Lite bill.” Hannity later said that “President Trump was not served well by his party in the House of Representatives.”Ingraham, who was a candidate to become Trump’s White House press secretary, also dubbed the bill “RyanCare” and similarly suggested on Friday that Trump was poorly served by Congress.Conservative radio host Mark Levin, one Trump critic who eventually supported Trump’s candidacy, encouraged his own millions of listeners this week to call their members of Congress and urge them to vote against the bill. After it was pulled, Levin assigned blame to the Republican leadership in a post mentioning Ryan, but not Trump. Throughout the weeks-long pushback, politics and media watchers had most closely watched Breitbart News, given that the site was previously led by chief Trump strategist Steve Bannon and remains one of the president’s favorite news sources. Breitbart has long targeted Ryan and others considered part of the Republican establishment. During his days as the site’s executive chairman, Bannon pushed for coverage to help drive Ryan out of the speaker’s office. So Breitbart’s recent attacks on the bill, and specifically on Ryan’s leadership, fueled suspicions in Washington that the old boss was still influencing its coverage or at a minimum sanctioning it. The site’s lead story on Friday morning suggested that Bannon was privately opposed to the bill and believed it was “written by the insurance industry,” according to an anonymous quote originally appearing in New York magazine. Hours later, Breitbart also raised eyebrows by posting a Democratic poll signaling little support for “Ryan’s healthcare bill.”The Breitbart stance most boisterously articulated by its chief Washington correspondent, Matthew Boyle, is that Ryan misled Trump on the health care bill and that the speaker’s behavior fits a pattern of not supporting Trump.Boyle recently published a never-before-heard recording of Ryan telling a group of House Republicans in October that he was “not going to defend Donald Trump — not now, not in the future.” Ryan’s remarks came after then-candidate Trump was caught on a 2005 recording boasting about groping women.On Friday’s Sirius show, Boyle said that failure to pass the bill would be “particularly embarrassing for Paul Ryan.”“It proves that he’s been misleading the president and doesn’t have the president’s best interests at heart,” Boyle said. If the bill failed, he said the question would be whether another member of the House “could better serve President Trump” as speaker. “I think there’s about anywhere from 15 to 20 different guys and gals in the House of Representatives who could be a better-off speaker than Paul Ryan,” Boyle said.Soon after the bill was pulled, Boyle followed up on that question in a story that was filled with anonymous critiques of Ryan and that claimed Republicans in Congress and the White House were “now openly discussing” replacing him as speaker. Michael McAuliff and Arthur Delaney contributed reporting."

She told The Huffington Post, though, that three days after doctors removed the tube, she became pregnant with her son Jameson, her first rainbow baby. (A rainbow baby is a baby born after a miscarriage, stillbirth, infant loss or neonatal death.)When Jameson was about 1, she became pregnant with her daughter, Wrightly, named because Britni only had her right fallopian tube.“She is my ‘right’ baby,” Britni told HuffPost.While awaiting Wrightly’s arrival, Britni and Jacob wanted to celebrate Britni’s pregnancy. In June 2016, they teamed up with photographer Brittney Studer of Brit Nicole Photography, who has known the couple since 2014, for a photo shoot at Palo Duro Canyon in Texas.Britni and Jacob wanted to include a rainbow smoke bomb as a nod to their kids after Britni’s ectopic pregnancy, but a burn ban in Texas kept them from carrying out their plan ― until Studer decided to get creative.“I knew I wanted to do something magical for her,” she said.After the couple posed for photos in the canyon, Studer decided to surprise Britni and Jacob by editing their pic in post-production to make it look like a rainbow smoke bomb had actually been part of the shoot. There was also a faint rainbow in the background that day that the photographer enhanced to make it look like it reached all the way across the sky.Britni told HuffPost that when she saw the edited photo she was “just blown away.”“The skills that Brit possesses are beyond incredible,” she told HuffPost. “It was beautiful and just brought to the surface all the feelings I had for my two beautiful blessings. Just love and joy and tears!”Studer, who also took Britni and Jacob’s engagement and wedding photos, said she loves what the photo “stands for” and how it reflects the couple’s journey. “They mean so much to me,” she said. When asked if she had advice for other moms who had experienced loss, Britni said there are no words to make the situation easier, but that “there is always hope.”“Whether it is babies from your own belly or through adoption, remember hope is not lost!” she said.

Georgia HR 644 would establish Confederate History Month in April, the month “the Confederate States of America began and ended a four-year struggle for states’ rights, individual freedom, and local governmental control, which they believed to be right and just.” The resolution goes on to deem April 26 “Confederate Memorial Day,” a day when state residents can remember “more than 90,000 brave men and women who served the Confederate States of America.” Benton said President Donald Trump’s campaign inspired his proposal. “We just elected a president that said he was tired of political correctness. And so that was the reason that we were looking to introduce the resolution,” Benton told WABE, a local NPR affiliate. “We think that our heritage is just as important as everybody else’s.” Yet for decades, people who fought to preserve the Old South’s “traditions” and “heritage” during the Civil War have been glorified ― while the role that slavery, racism and white pride played in the creation of these traditions has often gone unacknowledged. Dylann Roof, a white supremacist who massacred nine black parishioners in a historic black church in 2015, was pictured holding the Confederate flag in an online manifesto that outlined his hatred of black people and desire for a “real KKK.” He also voiced a desire to “save” the South. Even Confederate leaders themselves said the Civil War was about slavery and maintaining a way of life in which black people remained subservient. The vice president of the Confederacy said Southern states were fighting to keep “the negro” in “his place.” Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy, said slavery was the motivation for war in 1861. Secession statements from South Carolina, Mississippi, Texas and Georgia echo these sentiments. But Benton doesn’t think the Confederacy, and its symbols, have any link with current racism against black people. “This idea of every time something bad happens and wanting to blame it on a flag, or the idea of slavery, it’s just not right,” Benton told WABE.Read Benton’s resolution: "

Forcing a return to the city is a costly and outrageous hardship for the activists, most of whom have serious physical disabilities, said Gregg Beratan, an Albany, New York-based policy analyst for the Center for Disability Rights who was among those arrested. “It comes off as punitive,” Beratan said. “Adapt has been protesting in D.C. for years. We’ve never experienced anything like this.”The activists, a majority in wheelchairs, were arrested by Capitol Police on a charge of obstructing the Capitol rotunda, where they had gathered to protest the GOP legislation.Police held them for several hours for processing, and informed them they could return in the evening to pay the $50 fine and complete paperwork, according to Beratan and other protest organizers.But when the activists returned that evening, officers said they needed additional time for processing paperwork, the organizers said. Some of the activists stayed in Washington overnight and paid the fine the next day. Dozens of others had to leave town on Wednesday night without paying their fines. They include 24 activists who took a seven-hour overnight bus ride to the protest from Rochester, New York, as well as 12 activists from Philadelphia, and one from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.Eva Malecki, a spokeswoman for the Capitol Police, did not contradict activists’ account.“They can only pay their fines after all of their arrest paperwork is fully completed, which involves the generation of other documentation in addition to the officers processing each arrestee following their arrest,” Malecki said in an email. “It takes time to complete all of this documentation, and the timing of the completion of such can be impacted by the number of arrests made, time of day they are arrested, etc.”If the arrested protesters do not pay the fine or request to be arraigned in Superior Court in Washington within 15 days of their arrest, Capitol Police will issue arrest warrants.Protesters said they want police to permit a lawyer to pay the fines in person on their behalf.Bruce Darling, president of the Center for Disability Rights, helped arrange the bus from Rochester. Chartering a bus specially equipped for people with disabilities cost $3,896, paid with fundraising donations. In addition to the expense, a return trip involves special hardship for people with disabilities.“That is a long time for someone to be sitting for someone who has a spinal cord injury,” Darling said. “This is an incredible hardship for folks. And it’s offensive because they actually were there and tried to follow through.”Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.), who represents the arrested Pennsylvanians, has been following the ordeal, spokesman John Rizzo said.“It’s unfortunate that constituents with disabilities will have to travel back to DC to settle this issue when they were willing to do it while they here this week,” Rizzo said in a statement.Adapt’s lawyer is trying to reach an accommodation with Capitol Police. If that fails, the network of activists is prepared to begin fundraising for a return to Washington. “We’re still keeping our eye on the big picture, which is to stop these massive cuts to Medicaid that will force people into nursing homes and institutions,” Darling said. “It’s forcing people with disabilities into something like the Hunger Games.”"

They include 24 activists who took a seven-hour overnight bus ride to the protest from Rochester, New York, as well as 12 activists from Philadelphia, and one from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.Eva Malecki, a spokeswoman for the Capitol Police, did not contradict activists’ account.“They can only pay their fines after all of their arrest paperwork is fully completed, which involves the generation of other documentation in addition to the officers processing each arrestee following their arrest,” Malecki said in an email. “It takes time to complete all of this documentation, and the timing of the completion of such can be impacted by the number of arrests made, time of day they are arrested, etc.”If the arrested protesters do not pay the fine or request to be arraigned in Superior Court in Washington within 15 days of their arrest, Capitol Police will issue arrest warrants.Protesters said they want police to permit a lawyer to pay the fines in person on their behalf.Bruce Darling, president of the Center for Disability Rights, helped arrange the bus from Rochester. Chartering a bus specially equipped for people with disabilities cost $3,896, paid with fundraising donations. In addition to the expense, a return trip involves special hardship for people with disabilities.“That is a long time for someone to be sitting for someone who has a spinal cord injury,” Darling said. “This is an incredible hardship for folks. And it’s offensive because they actually were there and tried to follow through.”Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.), who represents the arrested Pennsylvanians, has been following the ordeal, spokesman John Rizzo said.“It’s unfortunate that constituents with disabilities will have to travel back to DC to settle this issue when they were willing to do it while they here this week,” Rizzo said in a statement.Adapt’s lawyer is trying to reach an accommodation with Capitol Police. If that fails, the network of activists is prepared to begin fundraising for a return to Washington. “We’re still keeping our eye on the big picture, which is to stop these massive cuts to Medicaid that will force people into nursing homes and institutions,” Darling said. “It’s forcing people with disabilities into something like the Hunger Games.”"
22,POLITICS,Trump’s 'Beachhead' Teams Host Dozens Of Former Lobbyists,"OpenSecrets Blog, ContributorPublished by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics an...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trumps-beachhead-teams-host-dozens-of-former-lobbyists_us_58d57dc9e4b06c3d3d3e6d8f,by Ashley Balcerzak and Niv Sultan Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price has been mired in questions about his investments,2017-03-24,Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price has at least eight former lobbyists serving on the beachhead team in his agency.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d583ec140000200007172b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"by Ashley Balcerzak and Niv SultanHealth and Human Services Secretary Tom Price has been mired in questions about his investments in the healthcare industry. As it turns out, some of the people helping him get grounded at the department are also prompting questions about their ties with the industry.Lance Leggitt, a lobbyist at Baker Donelson since 2006, was named Price’s chief of staff earlier this month. In 2016 alone, he lobbied for 10 organizations — all related to health care. Alere Inc, for example, manufactures diagnostic tests and spent nearly $900,000 lobbying last year. Other clients included hospitals and a medical trade group.Leggitt deregistered as a lobbyist in January, because he was on his way to HHS even before being made chief of staff. In the early days of the administration, Leggitt was a member of President Trump’s “beachhead” force, a temporary cast of characters brought in to keep the government running and lay the groundwork for Trump’s agenda. With key jobs in the administration being filled at a slower-than-average pace, these individuals can have a big impact on their agencies.In response to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by ProPublica, the names of 400 of the more than 520 members of beachhead teams were released by the Office of Personnel Management — including several dozen individuals who have been federally registered lobbyists, a review by OpenSecrets confirmed.Their positions can last 90 to 120 days, depending on the level, with one contract extension permitted — although many expect to be later hired on to full-time positions. That’s what happened with Leggitt, for example, and with Jack Kalavritinos, who was brought in on a beachhead assignment to help run FDA; that agency’s commissioner wasn’t named by Trump for close to two months. Kalavritinos worked at HHS in the mid 2000’s but more recently spent eight years lobbying for Covidien Ltd, an Ireland-based pharmaceutical and health products company. This week, Kalavritinos was named associate commissioner for external affairs at FDA.While past administrations have used some temporary personnel, they didn’t seem to do so at the same scale as Trump’s, said Max Stier, president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, which helps advise new administrations. Most pushed to have officials in place much more quickly.“There wasn’t a notion of a group of people that were only there for a limited period of time, but more of an expectation that the secretary and team would get in and be using the career folks,” Stier said. “The beachhead team creates another step in the process.” (The term “beachhead” was first used by Mitt Romney’s 2012 campaign; he didn’t get the chance to implement the concept.)It also creates “minders” of a sort who aren’t always appreciated by agency chiefs or civil service employees trying to do their work. According to the Washington Post, these temporary figures often act as eyes and ears for the White House, making sure the agencies are loyally hewing to the administration’s agenda.Now, some of the beachheaders with lobbying backgrounds did that work many years ago and went on to other careers. But even for more recent practitioners, Trump’s executive order on ethics, unlike President Obama’s, allows lobbyists to join the administration, even in the agencies they previously lobbied, though they are not supposed to work on specific issues on which they lobbied in the last two years. There are also restrictions on the lobbying that administration employees can do after they leave the public payroll, but there are a number of loopholes in the rules.It’s unclear if all the beachhead employees are bound by the Trump policy. Still, even if they are, there are a number of ways that former lobbyists can flourish in the administration. For instance, Trump could waive the executive order’s requirements for certain appointees, and now doesn’t even need to make those waivers public, like Obama did. (There is a section of the White House site that says “Ethics pledge waivers will be published as they become available,” but there weren’t any waivers posted when we published.)The placement of all these lobbyists as de facto — or actual — high-level agency staffers “raises the appearance that you could be attempting to influence public policy in favor of your former client,” said Meredith McGehee, chief of policy, programs and strategy at Issue One. “This isn’t saying that lobbyists are bad or evil, it’s simply saying the reason that you should have rules governing lobbyists in government is because they have been paid by private interests to promote the interests of their employer.”It makes a difference whether an individual lobbied last year of 10 years ago, McGehee said. Revolving door restrictions are written with time limits, because it’s understood your relationships with clients and freshness of information cool over time.One former for-profit college lobbyist has already resigned from his beachhead position at the Department of Education, where he worked for about a month. Taylor Hansen lobbied for Career Education Colleges and Universities until July 2016, where he focused on trying to weaken the “gainful employment” rule that puts for-profit schools’ federal funding at risk if their graduates don’t earn enough to pay back their student loans.ProPublica reported that soon after Hansen started working at Education, the agency began delaying deadlines for the gainful employment rule and is reviewing the implementation of the rule. Hansen told ProPublica he didn’t work on gainful employment while at the department.OpenSecrets Blog contacted the federal agencies with former lobbyist beachhead members about their ethics policies. The Department of Homeland Security was the only one to get back to us, and its response was vague:“Ethics training, consistent with U.S. Office of Government Ethics regulations, is provided to all political appointees,” said DHS spokesman David Lapan in an email. “DHS ethics attorneys conduct reviews for potential conflicts of interest and provide guidance to employees.”Nine beachhead members were registered lobbyists as recently as last year; eight of them have filed forms with the Senate deregistering from that work. General Mills has not filed paperwork that shows Erika Baum ending her lobbying gig at the food company, although she is now an executive assistant to the Secretary of Transportation, according to ProPublica‘s data and lobbying records.OpenSecrets Blog contacted all nine firms, and confirmed at least four beachheaders had formally resigned from their lobbying jobs, as opposed to taking temporary leaves of absence. Two firms said they could not divulge personnel information, and two did not reply by publication. (The ninth was General Mills.)Among the former cohorts on K Street:John Barsa, who is installed at DHS, has lobbied for the Aerospace Industries Association of America, a trade group for the aerospace and defense industry. He’s also represented MRIGlobal, a research organization that touts its security and defense program and runs facilities for the Department of Energy and the Department of Defense. He deregistered in 2013, though he stayed at his lobbying firm until 2015.Pete Giambastiani, in his role as special assistant at the office of the secretary of defense, might visit one of those facilities. He, too, has a history of lobbying on behalf of defense interests. His past clients, through 2014, include the Defense Venture Group, Finmeccanica SpA and the Navy League of the US. Giambastiani also served in the Department of the Navy and the offices of Reps. Jeff Miller (R-Fla.) and, most recently, Tom Rooney (R-Fla.).Mark Maddox‘s clients as a lobbyist included General Synfuels International, Calcasieu Refinery Co. and Cline Resource and Development. Now, fittingly, he’s a key beachhead figure at the Energy Department. He deregistered in 2015, though he continued working at The Livingston Group/Maddox Strategies.Then there’s Geoff Burr, who is at the Department of Labor. Until 2015, he was the top lobbyist for the Associated Builders and Contractors, which is always fighting wage standards in federal contracts and is on the other side of labor unions when it comes to exposure to hazardous materials. He then went on to run the lobbying shop at Cablevision. Burr previously put in time at Labor, from 2006 to 2008.Other departments have smatterings of staff who have lobbied on behalf of issues that are intensely political. Julie Kirchner, a Homeland Security adviser, represented the Federation for Amer Immigration Reform, a nonprofit that seeks to reduce immigration levels. (She deregistered in 2015.) At the Department of Agriculture, special assistant George Dunlop brings with him his experience lobbying for the Tobacco Quota Warehouse Alliance, which advocated in support of tobacco producers from 1999 to 2001.So far, the links between lobbying and the beachhead team have been pretty direct: Health care lobbyists at HHS, defense lobbyists at Homeland Security, and so on. But what about the Department of Commerce, which is tasked with the broad goal of expanding economic growth? Earl Comstock, director of the Office of Policy and Strategic Planning at Commerce, has demonstrated the flexibility befitting the nation’s multifaceted economy. In his 18 years of lobbying until 2015, he represented firms from Swiss International Air Lines to the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission to the Teamsters Union. He can now apply that diverse experience as he makes his way back to government — he was a staffer on the Senate Commerce, Science, & Transportation Committee from 1988-1991.In some cases, the revolving door made a complete 360 swivel: At least 14 of the beachheads have previously worked in the same agency where Trump has now placed them.One of them is Marcus Peacock, now adviser for Office of Management & Budget, who worked in that office for eight years under GOP Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush (R). Peacock worked for Jellinek, Schwartz & Connolly as a program manager in the early 1990’s. Most recently he was the environment & energy consultant for dark-money nonprofit Right to Rise Policy Solutions, which supported Jeb Bush.Here are the rest of the former lobbyists on Trump’s beachhead team:Patricia Adkins – Executive director at the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Lobbying client was the Home Safety Council until 2010, after which she worked at Safe Kids Worldwide. Has worked at CPSC since 2014 under Obama, and was temporarily hired to stay on under the Trump administration.Senior researcher Dan Auble contributed to this report. "

Masood, a British citizen from Kent who police said was born Adrian Russell Ajao, had not been under investigation in recent years. Authorities believe he was most recently living in the West Midlands. Masood is thought to be the man who on Wednesday mowed down pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, killing three people and injuring at least 40, before attempting to storm the nearby Parliament building. The assailant fatally stabbed one officer guarding the gates in front of the building before being shot dead by police. Authorities have arrested ten people in overnight raids Wednesday and Thursday, though one woman was released on bail. Police said they are continuing searches in Carmarthenshire, Birmingham and London. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack, referring to Masood as a “solider” of the militant group, but it was unclear to what extent the organization was involved. Authorities said earlier on Thursday that they believed Masood was inspired by terrorism abroad but acted alone. Prime Minister Theresa May said that he had been investigated for extremist views in the past.“He was a peripheral figure,” she said. “The case was historic; he was not part of the current intelligence picture.”The slain officer was identified as 48-year-old Keith Palmer. One of the bystander casualties was Aysha Frade, a 43-year-old teacher and mother of two. She was crossing the bridge to pick up her children from school when she was killed in the rampage, the BBC reports. Another victim died Thursday evening, police said. The 75-year-old man was hospitalized after sustaining injuries during the attack and had been on life support.The remaining death was Kurt Cochran, an American tourist from Utah, a family spokesman told the BBC. His wife was seriously injured but is expected to survive. The couple were in Europe celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary.U.S. President Donald Trump expressed condolences for the Cochran family Thursday:Londoners poured into Trafalgar Square Thursday evening for a vigil, carrying supportive signs, flowers and British flags. Mourners stood in silence for a minute and lit candles in honor of the victims. Mayor Sadiq Khan addressed the crowd and said they had come together to “send a clear message.”“Londoners will never be cowed by terrorism,” Khan said. “Those evil and twisted individuals who try to destroy our shared way of life will never succeed, and we condemn them.”Lawmakers in Parliament, who had been held in lockdown for hours after Wednesday’s attack, honored victims with a moment of silence on Thursday at 9:33 a.m. The time of the tribute corresponded with Palmer’s badge number, 933.“We are not afraid and our resolve will never waver in the face of terrorism,” said May, who had been in Parliament during the attack but was not harmed.May has visited victims of the attack in the hospital, Downing Street said.Stuart Bailey, 25, told the BBC he lives just four doors down from the raided flat in Birmingham. He was on his way to meet a friend for a drink when an armed police officer directed him away from the area.“There were a load of armed police in the street and on the pavement and I could see three or four in front of me,” Bailey, 25, said.“They were all dressed in black and armed with what looked like MP5s and one of them had six ammunition magazines strapped to his leg.”ISIS often makes claims of responsibility for terror attacks through its Amaq news agency, which functions as a kind of state-run media for the militant organization. But the group does not necessarily need to have any direct hand in planning or carrying out plots to claim them as their own. Instead, ISIS has established a framework in which any attacker that makes a public vow of allegiance to the group can be claimed as one of its own. Attacks can therefore be divided into those inspired by the group and those directed by it.Twenty-nine people were still receiving treatment at hospitals across the city, with five in critical condition. Victims hailed from countries including Romania, South Korea, Poland, Germany, Ireland and the U.S., May said. Among the injured were three police officers who had been on their way back from a commendation ceremony and several French students. Public transportation resumed mostly as normal on Thursday morning, and only the small section of the city where the attack transpired remained closed off. Mourners left flowers and messages of condolence near the attack sites. Tracey Allred, 34, takes the train into London from the suburbs every day and told HuffPost the Thursday morning commute “has not been out of the ordinary at all.”“If I hadn’t seen the news yesterday, then I wouldn’t have guessed that anything was different,” said Allred, who works near Westminster. “All of us on the train and the tube were just carrying on with our lives.”Jane McCallion, an editor at B2B, said that even late Wednesday, the area seemed be returning to normal.“If the Nazis dropping bombs every night didn’t stop this city, one man certainly won’t,” she said in a tweet.Wednesday’s terror attack was the worst in London since July 2005, when suicide bombers killed 52 people and injured hundreds more. Wednesday also marked one year since terrorists killed 32 people in bombings across Brussels.This is a developing story. Please check back for updates.

The assailant was wounded by Voronenkov’s bodyguard and later died in hospital, police said.Voronenkov fled to Ukraine last year and was helping the Ukrainian authorities build a treason case against Yanukovich, Ukraine’s pro-Kremlin former president.Voronenkov had also spoken out against Russia’s annexation of Crimea in March 2014, although he voted for the move at the time.President Petro Poroshenko said the killing “is an act of state terrorism on the part of Russia, which (Voronenkov) was forced to leave for political reasons.”“Voronenkov was one of the main witnesses of Russian aggression against Ukraine and, in particular, the role of Yanukovich regarding the deployment of Russian troops to Ukraine.”Relations between Kiev and Moscow are at an all-time low after Russia’s annexation of the Crimean peninsula in March 2014 and the subsequent outbreak of separatist fighting in Ukraine’s eastern Donbass region that has killed more than 10,000 people.Poroshenko said it was “no accident” that Voronenkov was shot on the same day as a warehouse storing tank ammunition was blown up at a Ukrainian military base.Moscow denied any involvement Voronenkov’s murder .“We believe that all the falsehoods that can already be heard about much-hyped Russian involvement are absurd,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying about the killing.Voronenkov, 45, had been placed on a Russian federal wanted-list in connection with an alleged $5 million property fraud. He came to Ukraine with his wife, opera singer Maria Maksakova, who was also an MP.Voronenkov was gunned down on his way to meet another former Russian parliamentarian, Ilya Ponomarev, who was the only member of the Duma who voted against the annexation of Crimea.“There’s an obvious theory - I’ve said that Voronenkov wasn’t a crook, but a deadly dangerous investigator for Russian officials,” Ponomarev wrote on Facebook.Television footage showed Ponomarev and Maksakova leaving the scene in a car together with Ukraine’s General Prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko.Lutsenko called the shooting a “cynical murder.”“He had provided investigators of the military prosecutor’s office with highly important (witness) testimony for the case. This was a typical show execution of a witness by the Kremlin,” Lutsenko said.Yanukovich fled Ukraine during the 2013-2014 Maidan street protests, which he said were tantamount to a “coup” organized by armed nationalist radicals. The former leader has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin for saving his life by helping him escape from Ukraine.(Additional reporting by Vladimir Soldatkin in MOSCOW; Writing by Matthias Williams; Editing by Tom Heneghan and Richard Lough)"

The church was unoccupied at the time.A few years ago, Cobb purchased property in the town of Leith, about 230 miles west of Nome, in hopes of turning it into an “Aryan stronghold,” according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors hate groups. He was convicted of terrorizing Leith’s residents after they accused him of patrolling the streets with a gun. He’s now serving four years on probation.Once the news spread that Cobb had bought the building in Nome, the people there expressed upset and concern. Jerome Jankowski, who lives near the church, said he had heard talk of people threatening to burn it down, but he didn’t think they were serious.“First of all, it’s a church, so it’s almost sacrilegious,” Jankowski told the Tribune.Still, he acknowledged that many people didn’t want Cobb there.“Everyone has some form of prejudice,” Jankowski said, “but this guy is way off the edge and he fell off.”How the fire started is not yet clear. A state fire marshal is planning to investigate the scene, the Barnes County Sheriff’s Office informed KVRR.Cobb told WDAY-TV that he thought the fire was “100 percent arson” and he offered a $2,000 reward for any information related to the incident.The sheriff’s office, reached by The Huffington Post on Thursday, referred questions to the State Fire Marshal’s Office, which declined comment, citing a state code that grants fire investigations confidentiality until the case is closed.Cobb also made news in 2013 when a DNA test revealed that he is 14 percent Sub-Saharan African. The results were announced to him on a British talk show, and his reaction was, well, priceless. "

That makes New York City one of the only big cities where both jail use and the crime rate are falling. The average daily population at Rikers went from 11,696 in 2013 to 9,758 in 2016, and is down to 9,362 this month.Nationwide, the latest available federal data shows that the population at local jails was 731,200 in 2013, rose to 744,600 in 2014, and then dropped to 728,200 in 2015. Data is not yet available for 2016, but the overall incarceration numbers in the U.S. are expected to remain flat from 2015 to 2016. De Blasio set out to lower the Rikers population after he took office in January 2014. His administration credits the drop in the jail population to its efforts in diverting mentally ill people from jail, making it easier to pay bail and promoting alternatives to incarceration. One example: The number of individuals stuck in jail on a bail of less than $2,000 has dropped by 36 percent in New York City. That’s an average of 244 fewer people locked up at Rikers on less than $2,000 bail on an average day. “The number of people incarcerated in the U.S. did not fall in the last year, and our nation’s incarcerated population remains the largest in the world. But New York City has a different story to tell – we are making every effort to ensure that people who do not need to be behind bars are not, all while keeping crime at historic lows,” de Blasio said in a statement to HuffPost. “In the last three years, we’ve been working from every angle to keep lower-level offenders out of jail and speed up case delays, and the total jail population has dropped 18% and the population just at Rikers Island has sunk 23% – that’s significant progress,” de Blasio stated.For decades, law enforcement has operated on the belief that a higher incarceration rate removes criminals from the streets and results in lower crime rates. But New York City’s track record shows that’s not necessarily the case, as criminal justice reform advocates have long suggested.The city’s record of lowering the jail population while also reducing crime makes it unique among major U.S. cities, wrote Elizabeth Glazer, director of the Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice, in a new report.“Over the long span of more than 20 years, crime has declined by 76% while the jail population has dropped by half,” Glazer wrote. “Over the last three years that trend has accelerated due to the intentional partnership and focus of all the parts of the criminal justice system: even as crime has gone down by 9%, the jail population has reduced by 16%.” Rikers Island continues to face major problems, however. Just this week, a corrections officer was arrested on federal charges for allegedly beating a handcuffed inmate in the shower and then filing a false use-of-force report. A different inmate’s lawyer indicated he planned to file a lawsuit after another inmate slashed his client in the face over the weekend.In December, a former Rikers corrections officer was found guilty for kicking an ill inmate in the head. The inmate later died. The Huffington Post’s jail deaths project found that 13 individuals died at Rikers over the course of a single year (although that number of deaths per year is in line with the national average for a facility the size of Rikers).Just 17.9 percent of Americans polled thought the main role of jails should be to punish convicted individuals, while 33 percent believed jails should help prevent crime by giving people treatment and services to help them avoid criminal activity, according to a recent poll conducted by RTI International and Zogby Analytics that was backed by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation.The poll also found that 67.4 percent of individuals believed that the risk a person poses to public safety should be the main factor in determining pretrial release, while just 9.5 percent believed ability to pay bail and other fees should be the main factor.

Lawrence “Larry” Lockman introduced LD 771, titled “An Act To Protect Political Speech and Prevent Climate Change Policy Profiling” earlier this month, at the behest of Jonathan Reisman, a self-described “prominent ‘denier’” and associate professor of economics and public policy at the University of Maine at Machias.Lockman has earned a reputation in the state house as a polarizing political figure. In 2014, he faced down calls for his resignation after comments surfaced in which he argued men should be able to rape women if abortion is legal.“If a woman has [the right to an abortion], why shouldn’t a man be free to use his superior strength to force himself on a woman?” Lockman wrote. “At least the rapist’s pursuit of sexual freedom doesn’t [in most cases] result in anyone’s death.”Reisman told The Huffington Post in an email Wednesday that the bill was drafted and submitted at his request in an effort to stymie Maine Attorney General Janet Mills, whom he says “has a serial record of abusing the 1st Amendment.”It’s unclear how the bill further protects free speech beyond what’s already guaranteed under the First Amendment. A question to that effect from HuffPost went unanswered by Reisman.According to an analysis by the Portland Press Herald, the legislation is clearly intended to hinder Attorney General Mills, who has expressed her support for a civil suit. Along with 17 other Attorneys General, Mills wants an investigation into Exxon Mobil for potentially defrauding investors and the public with false statements on climate change.“Here the Attorney General has made quite clear that she believes that opposition to the climate change policy of the Obama administration is a criminal offense,” Reisman told the Press Herald. “Her investigation is attempting to criminalize political speech that they disagree with.”Reisman elaborated on his position in an op-end sent to HuffPost, arguing that Mills is gagging free speech as defined by the Citizens United Supreme Court case in 2010. The case effectively classified financial contributions as free speech, opening the floodgates for corporate interests to pour money into political campaigns.The bill would also prevent Maine from taking a person’s “climate change policy preferences” into account when purchasing goods or services or in awarding grants or contracts.“This bill is a head scratcher,” Oamshri Amarasingham, advocacy director at the ACLU of Maine, told HuffPost. “All it seems to do is protect speech that is already protected by the First Amendment.”“If Rep. Lockman has heard from anyone who was denied a government job because of their position on climate change, he should send them our way.”Lockman emphasized to the Associated Press that his bill isn’t only about protecting climate change deniers. It would also protect the free speech of people concerned about climate change. For example, he said, “I don’t want to see a Republican state attorney general issuing subpoenas for the records of progressive or liberal think tanks or public policy groups to chill their free speech.”Lockman told The Associated Press he expects the bill will generate plenty of interest at its first public hearing, scheduled for April 6. This story has been updated with comment from the ACLU of Maine."

On March 18, journalist and current CNN commentator Sally Kohn posted a photo on Instagram of a postcard her daughter, 8-year-old Willa, wrote to DeVos.Willa got the postcard while visiting a store owned by Kohn’s friend, Diana Kane, in Brooklyn, New York. The store was showcasing photographs from the Women’s March on Washington and offered postcard versions of the pics and stamps so customers could write to political leaders. Willa told her mom she wanted to write to “the woman in charge of education.” On the postcard, Willa wrote about how much she enjoys her public school. She then asked DeVos to not “tear it down.” “Please leave are [sic] public schools alone,” Willa wrote. “Do not tear it down ever.”Though Kohn described the part where her daughter signed the postcard as “Willa, daughter of Sally Kohn” as “ridiculously embarrassing” and wants to make sure her daughter doesn’t think that her name “opens doors,” she was “so impressed” by the message. She said her family listens to NPR at home in the mornings, and she thinks Willa must have gotten the motivation to write to DeVos from hearing news reports.Parents and educators across the country denounced DeVos’ nomination and her subsequent confirmation as education secretary, often citing her lack of experience with public schools. During her confirmation hearing, DeVos also made headlines with her confusion about the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act and her suggestion that guns should be allowed in some schools to keep students safe from grizzly bears.Kohn told HuffPost she was proud of her daughter for speaking up to protect her education. She praised the school Willa attends and hopes one day all schools will have the necessary resources to keep kids thriving.“It’s a wonderful place with wonderful teachers and administrators and volunteers who do so very much for so very many kids with incredibly strapped resources,” she said. “It’s amazing what creative, supportive places of learning our public schools are, even with limited support from policy makers. Imagine if our public schools actually got what they need?”The HuffPost Parents newsletter, So You Want To Raise A Feminist, offers the latest stories and news in progressive parenting. "

Later this year, she will succeed Wade Henderson, who has served as president and CEO since 1996 and helped grow the organization into a coalition of more than 200 civil and human rights groups.Gupta, 42, began her legal career at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, where she fought for dozens of people in a tiny Texas town who had been locked up on the lies of a racist rodeo cowboy paid by police to conduct drug stings. She served as deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union. In October 2014, just months after the unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, Gupta was named acting head of the Civil Rights Division. On her watch, the Justice Department issued a damning report on the operations of Ferguson’s police department and municipal court in early 2015 and later released other critical reports on the Baltimore and Chicago police forces. The Justice Department reached deals with officials in Ferguson and Baltimore to improve their law enforcement practices, while a potential agreement with Chicago remains in question under Attorney General Jeff Sessions.In an interview with The Huffington Post, Gupta said initiatives that the Civil Rights Division championed during the Obama administration are “quite vulnerable” in the Trump era. The groups that make up the Leadership Conference, she said, are at the “heart of the resistance” fighting rollbacks of civil rights protections.“We’re going to have to use the power of the field operation here at the Leadership Conference and the member organizations to mobilize an American public that right now is really eager to fight back and to resist assaults on the very values that we all hold dear,” Gupta said.She sees the Leadership Conference as a “nerve center” for both defending civil rights on the federal level and pushing forward to advance civil rights on the state level.The member organizations of the Leadership Conference have a crucial role to play during the Trump era in her view. “We can’t rely on Congress to be a check on the executive branch right now,” Gupta said.It was gratifying, she added, to see people “of all stripes, religions and races coming together” in response to the Trump administration’s travel ban.“I think this is a time of unprecedented solidarity among the groups that make up the Leadership Conference to recognize that an attack on one of us is an attack on all of us,” said Gupta. “For me, this opportunity could not come at a better time, because I think we all know very well, and all too well, what’s at stake.”Several civil rights leaders applauded Gupta’s appointment. Former Attorney General Eric Holder praised her “fearless advocacy for the rights of all Americans.” Anthony Romero, executive director of the ACLU, called her a “once-in-a-generation leader.” Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, said Gupta was at the “forefront of bold, imaginative and uncompromising civil rights leadership.”Gupta, who worked closely on policing issues at the Justice Department, said she was troubled by the Trump administration’s indications that the department will pull back from the broad reform efforts pursued by the Obama administration. “It is a huge, radical departure for this Justice Department to step away from that work,” Gupta said.But “even if this Justice Department is out of step with what’s happening around this country,” she said, civil rights advocates and policing organizations have an important role to play in pushing reform forward.“The role of local community input in holding local officials accountable to enforcement has always been really important, and there will be a role for the Leadership Conference to play in lifting up those community voices and the member organizations that are really engaged on that,” Gupta said.

(And George Clooney singing “Hollaback Girl.”)At Los Angeles’ PaleyFest on Wednesday, James Corden revealed that ― should he ever have the chance ― his interview plans for Donald Trump would be pretty much the same.The “Late Late Show” host broached the subject after defending Jimmy Fallon against all the flak he took for the Trump hair-tousling incident heard ‘round the world, according to Entertainment Weekly. Corden said the backlash Fallon received for the segment was “really unfair.”“I don’t think anyone asked him the right questions,” he added.So how do you ask the right questions? Corden has a plan.The “Late Late Show” host explained how he would challenge Trump to face his own statements. Corden revealed a game that his show had planned for the president, and as George Clooney ― quoting Gwen Stefani ― might say, “This shit is bananas.”The game I wanted to play if he came on the show was called “Stand By It or Take It Back.” I would read Donald Trump things that he had said on the campaign trail. I would say, [he’d] have two paddles, you can stand by it or take it back. If you take it back, you take it back forever. If you stand by it, you’ve got to tell me why, and I felt like that was such a good game.Corden’s game simply requires Trump to address the same words he’s already said. So when the president tweets about “wiretapping,” but really means something completely different, we might actually understand him. It’s a win-win for everyone.Trump didn’t stop by the “Late Late Show” during his campaign, however, and there’s no sign he might appear on Corden’s show in the near future. So anyone with plans to interview the president should take notes."
38,POLITICS,Government Lets Trump Off The Hook For His Washington Hotel Conflict Of Interest,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-hotel-lease-conflict_us_58d43471e4b02a2eaab1f733,An agency that reports to the president says Trump International Hotel is in full compliance with its lease.,2017-03-23,"Trump International Hotel employees cheer during the Inaugural Parade on January 20, 2017 in Washington, DC. Donald J. Trump was sworn in today as the 45th president of the United States.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d4380f2c00002100ff0167.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The General Services Administration said Thursday that Trump International Hotel in Washington isn’t violating its lease with the government, even though it appears to prohibit an elected official from benefiting.The declaration by the GSA that the president’s business is in full compliance with lease terms comes after the Trump Organization modified its business structure to conform to legal language that appears to prohibit an elected official from taking part in the lease. In addition, Trump said he removed himself from management positions with his companies and placed his sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump in charge. The president is keeping his full ownership stake in his businesses, and he can reap the spoils when he leaves office.Trump’s November victory raised questions over the obvious conflicts of interest surrounding his D.C. hotel. Aside from his tenancy in a government-owned building where he has now become landlord, the hotel has attracted a flock of foreign dignitaries, lobbyists and other influence-seekers. Wealthy Cabinet members are living there, while the president’s business partners and donors make sure to stay at the hotel when they are in town.The GSA announcement did little to mollify critics of the government’s lease with Trump.Democrats, who had sought a GSA review of the lease since the election, greeted the decision with extreme skepticism. Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.), the ranking Democrat on the House Transportation Committee, said GSA officials had previously told them that Trump was not in compliance with his lease.“GSA changed the position it held before President Trump took office,” Cummings and DeFazio said in a joint statement Thursday. “This new interpretation renders this lease provision completely meaningless ― any elected official can now defy the restriction by following this blueprint. The letter provides a completely inadequate explanation for its decision and instead footnotes news articles and recites the complex structure of trusts and limited liability corporations through which President Trump and his family own the hotel. This decision allows profits to be reinvested back into the hotel so Donald Trump can reap the financial benefits when he leaves the White House. This is exactly what the lease provision was supposed to prevent.”Steven Schooner, a government procurement legal expert at George Washington University Law School, has been highly critical of Trump’s roles in the hotel as both landlord and tenant. (Schooner is a member of a team of pro bono lawyers representing a Washington restaurant suing the Trump hotel for unfair business practices.)Schooner said in an email to HuffPost that he sees conflict in the GSA finding that the hotel complies with its lease. “Not only is the conclusion unexpected and unpersuasive, as a matter of law, but, as a matter of policy, it is harmful to the integrity ― and thus credibility ― of GSA, the Presidency, and federal procurement process,” he wrote.“It is deeply troubling that the contracting officer’s letter makes no reference to the underlying conflicts of interest, which, of course, undercuts any suggestion that he (the contracting officer) engaged in independent analysis,” Schooner continued. “The [contracting officer’s] decision favors the President, who, in effect, is his supervisor, just as it favors the GSA (in terms of maintaining the status quo); but it also pleases his (the [contracting officer’s]) ultimate supervisor ― the head of the agency ― who serves at the President’s pleasure.”Trump, his sons, and his daughter Ivanka signed the lease in 2013. It included a provision stating, “no … elected official of the Government of the United States … shall be admitted to any share or part of this Lease, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom; provided, however, that this provision shall not be construed as extending to any Person who may be a shareholder or other beneficial owner of any publicly held corporation or other entity, if this Lease is for the general benefit of such corporation or other entity.”Trump’s lawyers provided the GSA with numerous arguments for why this provision should not apply to the president. Their most consequential argument pointed to a provision banning elected officials from taking part in the lease, but exempting anyone “who may be a shareholder or other beneficial owner of any publicly held corporation or other entity, if this Lease if for the general benefit of such corporation or other entity.”Trump’s lawyers argued that the term “publicly held” applied to the word “corporation,” but not to “other entity.” To ensure that profit earned through the lease would fall to the “general benefit” of this “other entity,” the lawyers altered the structure of the Trump-owned limited liability companies involved in the hotel. In an amendment to the operating agreement, Trump’s lawyers declared that the company owning the hotel and its lease will not distribute any funds to the president or any entity connected to him while he’s in office. Instead, those funds will be held by the hotel’s main corporate body and will only used for business activities."

41,POLITICS,Trump's Agriculture Pick Sure Doesn't Seem Opposed To Food Stamp Cuts,Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sonny-perdue-confirmation-hearing_us_58d3f95fe4b0b22b0d1ab164,Senators from both parties have hardly questioned the nominee on the federal nutrition program. Advocates say that's not a good sign.,2017-03-23,"Sonny Perdue arrives for his confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry on Thursday in Washington.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d3f9b51d0000f42c7d00d1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The long-delayed confirmation hearing of Sonny Perdue, President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the U.S. Department of Agriculture, finally arrived before the Senate on Thursday.For two hours, members of the Senate’s Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee peppered the former Georgia governor with questions mostly centered on elements of trade, crop insurance and forest policy, but largely avoided more controversial topics.The most glaring omission was any real interrogation regarding the nutrition programs overseen by the USDA, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known colloquially as “food stamps.”Perdue faced only one question on SNAP on Thursday. About an hour and a half into the hearing, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) asked whether he would commit “to focusing on how we can deliver more food to more families throughout this country” by supporting the program.Perdue stopped short of making that commitment, appearing to suggest changes could be coming to the program, though he offered no detail on what sort of reforms he might support or anticipate.“I hope we can do that even more efficiently and effectively than we have,” Perdue said. “It’s certainly important to the children and families of America. I hope we can work together to accomplish that.”That response was a red flag to Mike Lavender, a spokesman for the Union of Concerned Scientists’s food and environment program.“What’s left out of the conversation is just as important as what’s brought in,” Lavender told HuffPost Thursday. “You can read into that in a number of ways, but [Perdue’s comments] doesn’t increase my confidence that SNAP is going to be able to reach more people and get more healthy food to more people.”The absence of further questions on SNAP or any questions on the agency’s other nutrition programs — such as the National School Lunch Program — belies the fact that these programs eat up about 71 percent of the agency’s annual spending.Despite its well-documented success at reducing participants’ food insecurity, SNAP has also been the subject of numerous hearings exploring potential reforms, and has been viewed as a likely target for cuts under the Trump administration.Other controversial topics were left entirely off the table at the Thursday hearing. Climate change — which Perdue has downplayed, despite the close link between farming and greenhouse gas emissions and the significant impacts it is having on farmers’ livelihoods — was not mentioned in any of the questions.In addition, Perdue’s ethics record and potential conflicts of interests, which have been the subject of a series of detailed recent reports from a number of media outlets, were also left unaddressed.Tiffany Finck-Haynes, a food futures campaigner at Friends of the Earth, an environmental advocacy group, said she was “deeply concerned” that questions on these topics were avoided by committee members.“With all of Perdue’s history on denying climate change and all his conflicts of interest that have come out, to have no mention of all these things is a complete missed opportunity,” Finck-Haynes said. “They are not fully fulfilling their duties to make sure he is actually fit for this role and that he is going to prioritize the interests of the American public and the environment over big agribusiness.”Some of the committee members’ most pointed questions on Thursday concerned the president’s proposed slashing of the USDA’s budget, which is slated for a 21 percent reduction — percentage-wise, one of the largest cuts proposed for any federal agency.Perdue said Thursday he was not consulted by the administration before they published the agency’s proposed budget. In response to a number of questions concerning those cuts, the nominee stated his support for some USDA programs that have been slated for funding reductions, such as the rural water program and conservation efforts like those impacting the Chesapeake Bay.“Agriculture is in my heart,” Perdue said in response to a question from Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.). “I look forward to fighting for the producers of America. We know how vital it is and I will absolutely be a tenacious advocate and fighter [for agriculture] where necessary to do that.”Committee members can still submit further questions to Perdue until the end of Friday, ahead of a full Senate vote on his confirmation. Finck-Haynes was hopeful senators will push for more detail from the nominee.“We have very few answers on what he is actually going to do in terms of protecting farmers, consumers and our environment,” Finck-Haynes added. “The American public deserves to know where and what he’s going to do.”It doesn’t appear likely that Perdue will face much additional grilling or pushback on his nomination, however. He has a wide base of support from farm industry groups who tout his farming background — Perdue grew up on a dairy farm, was trained as a veterinarian and has owned several agriculture related businesses — as evidence that he’s the right pick for the post.Farm groups are antsy for Perdue’s confirmation. The National Farmers Union, the farming industry’s second-largest organization, reiterated its support for Perdue on Thursday, urging the Senate to move forward with the nominee.“If confirmed, Sonny Perdue will be stepping into a position of great importance within this administration,” NFU president Roger Johnson said in a statement.“To this point, agriculture and rural America have not had a seat at the table in this administration.”To date, Perdue is one of only two Trump Cabinet positions yet to be confirmed by the Senate. The other, Department of Labor nominee Alexander Acosta, was nominated in February following the withdrawal of Andrew Puzder. Acosta faced his confirmation hearing Wednesday.―-Joseph Erbentraut covers promising innovations and challenges in the areas of food, water, agriculture and our climate.

42,POLITICS,Trump's Agriculture Pick Vows To Fight For Chesapeake Bay Cleanup Despite Budget Cuts,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/perdue-chesapeake-bay_us_58d3ff76e4b02d33b749866e,The president has proposed cutting funding for programs to restore the heavily polluted region.,2017-03-23,Two fishing boats anchored in front of a power plant on the Chesapeake Bay. Part of the federal cleanup effort in the region focused on reducing pollution from utilities which goes into the air and settles on the water,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d40dd5140000880607128c.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Agriculture secretary nominee Sonny Perdue on Thursday vowed to defend efforts to restore the Chesapeake Bay, even though the White House has proposed eliminating funding for its cleanup. If confirmed, the former Georgia governor would not have power over the Environmental Protection Agency’s $73 million initiative targeting runoff from farming fertilizer, the chief source of the nitrogen and phosphorus contaminating the Chesapeake Bay. But he said his Department of Agriculture would continue to work with farmers to reduce pollution.“I don’t believe we can continue the progress that’s been made,” he said, referring to the the across-the-board cuts proposed in President Donald Trump’s skinny budget. “I certainly hope we can even increase and continue the progress.”Perdue offered scant details as to how he would secure gains made through decades of federally funded work. Trump has suggested slashing the USDA’s budget to $17.9 billion, a 21 percent reduction that halts funding for rural clean water projects and agrarian business services. The proposed cut also targets the USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service, which provides assistance to farmers in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, at a time when farm incomes are down 50 percent from four years ago.Roughly 30 percent of the watershed ― which stretches north from Virginia, through Maryland, Delaware and Pennsylvania and into parts of western New York ― is made up of agricultural lands. Nitrogen and phosphorus, often from chicken manure used to fecundate soil, are carried from streams and rivers into the bay. The elements feed toxic algae blooms that absorb oxygen and block out the sun, which prevents marsh grasses from growing underwater. Oysters and blue crabs die from lack of oxygen or by slipping into soft mud that would normally be made taut with grass roots.The oyster industry, once a regional cash cow, has staged a major comeback as results from the cleanup effort began to show over the past decade, as The Huffington Post reported this week. The wild oyster population has yet to bounce back, but farmers who raise bivalves in underwater cages on the bay and its estuaries have seen business boom since the water became less cloudy about six years ago.“I’m a farmer, we’re farmers, we’re members of the Farm Bureau,” said Bob Rheault, executive director of the East Coast Shellfish Growers Association. “Yet we find ourselves at odds with land farmers, unfortunately, who resist efforts to use best management practices and limit impacts of fertilizer on the watershed.” Perdue doesn’t seem to see it that way. He called the Chesapeake Bay “a vital resource nationally” that will be preserved “much to the credit of farmers, agribusiness and others who acknowledged the runoff.” “Hopefully we can continue the education and the national NRCS there so we can continue that program,” he said.

43,POLITICS,Everything About This Republican Obamacare Repeal Vote Is Nuts,Jeffrey Young and Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republican-obamacare-repeal-vote-overview_us_58d2ec22e4b0f838c62f4285,It might work anyway!,2017-03-23,"Premiums Paid Under the Affordable Care Act vs American Health Care Act, in 2020 ",https://public.tableau.com/static/images/6B/6BPKS2XTN/1_rss.png,"Something extraordinary is on the cusp of taking place in Washington on Thursday.An unpopular president and a House Republican leadership team with a seemingly weak grasp of its own members’ priorities is preparing to rush through legislation that would trade 24 million people’s health coverage for a huge tax cut on wealthy households and health care corporations.This nearly friendless plan goes by the name of the American Health Care Act, a dull title that belies not only the havoc it could wreak on the health care system but the chaos it’s creating within the Republican Party, from the White House to Capitol Hill to the monied interests that fund the GOP’s agenda. The Republican health care reform bill polls poorly, has sparked protests across the country, and would have disproportionately harmful effects on the older, poorer and rural voters often credited with President Donald Trump’s electoral victory while having disproportionately positive effects for well-off urbanites. It doesn’t solve the Affordable Care Act’s problems, or fulfill Trump’s promises to offer universal coverage or his and other Republicans’ promises to reduce health care costs for consumers.House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) will ask his majority to vote for this bill despite all this, and without providing them with a Congressional Budget Office analysis of what effects the latest version of the bill would have on the number of Americans with health coverage or what that coverage would cost. The White House and GOP leaders were even making major changes to the bill that would undermine consumer protections late Wednesday night.And Ryan intends to hold this vote with no idea what the outcome will be.If it gets through the House, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) says he’ll have it on the floor of the upper chamber next week, even though enough Republican senators have spoken out against the bill that it could fail to get a majority in the Senate.The best reason any Republican can come up with for passing this bill is that they said they would. The pretense that the legislation will result in better health care all but fell by the wayside once the CBO concluded tens of millions would lose their health insurance.As one person said Wednesday, “Simply put, this bill does not meet the standards of what was promised; it is not as good or better than what we currently have.” That person was 11-term Republican Rep. Frank LoBiondo (N.J.). To understand how a bill with such little apparent political upside could actually be this close to becoming law, one must first understand the driving dynamics of the modern Republican Party. It is, fundamentally, a party that’s inoculated by congressional districts drawn in its favor, and that’s driven by process as much as policy. There is a zeal to exact revenge on former President Barack Obama and the Democratic Party and to fulfill its promises to “repeal and replace Obamacare” that could overwhelm any other consideration. And there is also a belief that a legislative “win” ― even for a piece of legislation this universally disliked ― is as important as the policy outcome it produces. “Right now the Republican base is holding solid, and most of these House members are from solid districts,” said former Rep. Tom Davis (R-Va.) “So if the base holds, the members will be fine. Most of them. But if they don’t do this, the Republican base gets pissed. They start to not have faith in their own members and that’s when you see these big problems.” “The worst thing that can happen is it goes down,” Davis added. “That is a worse result for you because at that point your base collapses. I don’t think there is any way they can not pass something and the majority survives.” This view is shared not just by former members but by current ones as well. The prevailing wisdom on Capitol Hill is that if health care reform doesn’t pass, the Republican Party’s entire agenda may be imperiled. That’s one of the reasons why Trump has fully embraced the bill and why Ryan remains determined to force this bill to the floor Thursday ― the seventh anniversary of the Affordable Care Act’s enactment ― after forcing it through four committees in two weeks, in the face of strong opposition within his conference the entire time.But beyond Trump’s White House, House GOP leaders and rank-and-file House members who will vote as they’re told, it’s not easy to find many people who actually want this legislation to become law. Trump’s vaunted (at least in his own estimation) dealmaking prowess has had a limited effect on the members of his own party who oppose it to date. Blocs of conservatives and moderates have expressed dislike of the bill for different reasons. And though Republicans now control all the levers of the federal government, even repealing the hated Affordable Care Act might be beyond their grasp.And that’s because of another dynamic of the modern Republican Party: In certain quarters, it pays to be antagonistic. The Republican Obamacare “replacement” is opposed by the Heritage Foundation, the Club for Growth, FreedomWorks and even the notoriously pro-Trump Breitbart News. The House Freedom Caucus, a collection of hard-line, tea party conservatives, has opposed Ryan and Trump’s plan because it doesn’t take away health care from enough people fast enough. And in a twist of irony, these conservative lawmakers who have been holding out stood as the greatest hope liberals have that the Affordable Care Act safety net will remain in place. The White House and GOP leaders, however, may have won over enough of them by considering changes to the bill that would, among other things, allow insurers to go back to selling policies that don’t cover basic benefits. But this may further alienate moderates and could run afoul of Senate budget rules.Part of the opposition from conservative lawmakers and groups has been based on the notion that the GOP health care bill is not pure enough. But some of it is tied to the concern that the end product would harm their own base of voters: the rural, the elderly and the working poor. “The argument is we have to do something,” explained Dave Carney, a longtime GOP operative based in New Hampshire. “I’m saying, doing a worse thing is not better than doing nothing at all. Be careful what you wish for. Any bill that protects insurance companies and not individuals is a political loser.”Both Carney and Davis suggested that, ultimately, the House would pass a bill with the hope that it ends up being changed or, perhaps, killed by the Senate. Republicans in the upper chamber seem more attuned to the politics at play ― perhaps because they must run statewide.The health care sector almost uniformly rejects this legislation. The health insurance industry is delicately balancing its support for short-term funding that would benefit them with its anxiety about longer-term cuts to Medicaid and health insurance subsidies that would harm them. Consumer groups like AARP and the March of Dimes are marshaling their forces against it. Mainly, however, they recognize that especially in those states that used Affordable Care Act money to expand Medicaid, the Republican Party would shoulder all the blame for having millions of people lose coverage and access to care.Still, should the bill die in the Senate after having passed through the House, the same conclusion will have been reached. Republicans made promises on health care they couldn’t keep, and it might finally be catching up to them. If the bill fails, their years of promises of repeal will have been exposed as empty. If this bill passes, their voters will find out what it does. People, after all, tend to notice if their health insurance gets worse or more expensive. Just ask Barack Obama."

The Interior Department will be the first federal agency to adopt a dog-friendly policy, The Washington Post reports.“Today is National Puppy Day, and I don’t know about you, but it makes me think of how much my family dog, Ragnar, makes my day better,” he wrote to the department’s 70,000 employees spread across the country. “Opening the door each evening and seeing him running at me is one of the highlights of my day.”The program kicks off with “test days” on May 5 and Sept. 1 at the department’s Washington headquarters. Zinke noted that some employees may have concerns about the canine-friendly policy, and said he plans to issue rules for visiting dogs and flexibility for those who do not want to interact with them, including the ability to work outside the office.“Scientific studies show having a dog around the office improves morale and productivity, and having dogs around the office has health benefits like reducing stress levels,” Zinke wrote. “Research suggests it might make you trust your coworker more and improve collaboration too. I’m willing to give it a shot and hope you’ll work with me in this new endeavor.”Zinke, a former Montana congressman and Navy SEAL, arrived at his new post March 2 on horseback wearing a cowboy hat. He addressed his new staff a day later.“I knew I was going to be a popular secretary because we’re going to make the building dog-friendly,” he said.His dog, Ragnar, is a Havanese, a small, sturdy breed “of immense charm,” according to the American Kennel Club.Zinke’s boss, Donald Trump is the first president in well over 100 years not to have a dog in the White House. “I can’t even count how many miles I’ve driven across Montana with Ragnar riding shotgun, or how many hikes and river floats Lola and I went on with the little guy,” Zinke wrote in his email. “But I can tell you it was always better to have him.”Zinke’s email makes no mention of cats, rabbits or any other pet species.The announcement about the morale-boosting initiative comes one week after the White House unveiled its “America First” budget proposal, which calls for cutting the Interior Department’s budget 12 percent to $11.6 billion.

Dan Kildee (D-Mich.), Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards, and Kierra Johnson, executive director of Unite for Reproductive and Gender Equality, demonstrators marched down Pennsylvania Avenue to the Trump International Hotel. There they stopped to chant their dissatisfaction with the hotel’s proprietor, President Donald Trump, and stage a die-in to simulate the deadly effects of the Republican bill. They then proceeded to the White House by foot with a police escort. Community organizations that often supply ground troops for progressive causes, such as New York Communities for Change and the immigration rights-focused Make the Road New York, sent buses of activists from New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania to the Washington rally. Other attendees ― many of them sporting the pink-knit “pussy” hats of the women’s march and holding homemade signs ― said they heard about the event through social media or online liberal groups.Christian Smith, 24, a Dallas-based policy analyst, held a sign with a blown up photo of the singer Adele on one side. On the other side were the lyrics, “We could have had it all,” from her hit song “Rolling in the Deep.”“We could still have it all if there’s a Congress that represents all people, including equal rights of women as well,” Smith said.Smith, a volunteer with the League of Young Latin American Citizens, said Obamacare was personal for him since it has allowed him to stay on his parents’ health insurance coverage. While he acknowledged that the Republican replacement bill kept that provision in place, he was deeply concerned about its overall effect on his ability to afford health care after age 26, when he will no longer be eligible to stay on his parents’ coverage. “A lot of this has to do with the cost-saving as opposed to the actual ‘care’ part of health care,” Smith said. “While that may sound appealing to people interested in saving money, there is a lot more cost associated with denying coverage to people based on various criteria.”The racially and socioeconomically diverse crowd embodied the sort of intersectional protest that progressive leaders have long hailed as the model for effecting political change. Nodding to attendees’ wide range of political priorities, speakers often added a call for solidarity with undocumented immigrants to their remarks about protecting health care reform. The marchers’ chants incorporated themes of social justice for other marginalized groups as well, such as queer and transgender Americans. Debbie Mathis, 64, a college counselor from Clinton, Maryland, took off work to join the protest after hearing about it from People Power, a new Trump-era activism initiative started by the American Civil Liberties Union. Mathis was most concerned about protecting the Affordable Care Act, citing her own challenges affording adequate medical care for her son when he was younger.But she was also motivated by a deep fear of the threat she believes Trump poses to her entire way of life. In addition to protesting Trump in person, she said she routinely bombards members of Congress with phone calls and letters.“Everything that is going on, all of our civil rights ― our democracy is being threatened,” Mathis said. “I’ve never really been a person who’s been involved in politics, but now it’s like I do everything.”"

47,BLACK VOICES,Neo-Nazi Troll Suggests Prejudice Against Racists Is The Same As Islamophobia,David Moye,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/andrew-anglin-white-supremacist-murder_us_58d418cce4b02d33b749bb7b,Nope.,2017-03-23,"Andrew Anglin, founder of the neo-Nazi Daily Stormer website, wrote that he fears the racially motivated murder of Timothy Caughman will increase discrimination against white supremacists.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d4194a1d0000f42c7d016e.png?cache=KlABH9FXPf&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Prominent neo-Nazi Andrew Anglin ostensibly condemned the recent fatal stabbing of a black man in New York, claiming he fears it will compromise the public’s perception of white supremacists and increase discrimination against them. His rhetoric draws heavily on the kinds of language often used by Muslims after an act of violence from extremist Islamic terrorists, as if to make a comparison between prejudice against Muslims and prejudice against white supremacists. But in reality, those comparisons just don’t make sense. Anglin is the founder of the Daily Stormer, a website that the Southern Povery Law Center says is dedicated to spreading anti-Semitism, neo-Nazism, and white nationalism.His writings include many offensive statements about African-Americans and how he believes they are “incompatible with whites” can’t help their “irrational outbursts of brutal violence are a part of their nature.”So it may have initially caught some off-guard when Anglin condemned the recent murder of Timothy Caughman, a black man fatally stabbed by a white man on Monday. Police arrested James Harris Jackson for the killing, and said the 28-year-old suspect told them he traveled from Baltimore specifically to kill black men and that he had plans to kill more. In a blog post on Wednesday, Anglin denounced the slaying but for reasons that have nothing to do with an innocent man losing his life for hateful reasons. Instead, Anglin’s purported rationale for condemning the murder was a little more outlandish. He claimed to believe it was going to paint white supremacists in a bad light and lead to discrimination against them.But if the words in Anglin’s post seem oddly familiar, it’s because he’s purposely co-opting words and phrases used to combat Islamophobia. He even goes so far as to call white supremacy a “religion of peace” ― a phrase often used to describe Islam:“Though we should acknowledge the tragedy of what Jackson did, the most important thing for us to remember is that he does not represent White Supremacy. White Supremacy is a religion of peace, and the overwhelming majority of White Supremacists are peaceful members of society who do not agree with stabbing random black people with swords.Anglin also pontificated about whether white supremacists will be forced to cover up their swastika tattoos, or risk being victimized by “bigots who would wrongly associate them with this attack.” That statement, of course, has echoes of widespread reports of Muslim women afraid to wear the hijab because of physical and verbal attacks caused by anti-Islamic sentiment.Those allusions were clear to Nazir Harb, a post-doctoral senior research fellow and Islamophobia expert at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.“[Anglin] knows what he’s doing,” Harb told HuffPost. “He’s trying to justify acts of white supremacy — acts that are unjustifiable — and ridicule valid and legitimate anti-Islamophobic arguments at the same time. It’s an attack on Muslims within a troubling defense of a white supremacist murderer.”But Harb explained that the comparison just doesn’t stand up to close scrutiny.“It is textbook false equivalence,” he said. “White supremacy is not a religion. It’s a hateful, racist ideology with dangerous political and demographic aims. It is a social ill that’s been condemned by the U.S. government as both an ideology and a growing number of hate groups across the country based on that ideology.”As even more evidence Anglin is intentionally co-opting anti-Islamophobic phrases to promote his hateful worldview, he ends his post by proposing white supremacists and the people who inexplicably love them signal their support on Twitter with #IllRideWithYou.He says it will be a way to connect neo-Nazis and other racists with people happy to accompany them to work to make sure they get there safe.That hashtag was previously used by Australians fighting Islamophobia by reaching out to Muslims in their communities. And Anglin co-opting the hashtag wasn’t accidental ― he expressly linked to a Mic story about the hashtag in his post.This story has been updated to include comments from Harb and more information about Anglin’s blog post and rhetoric."
48,POLITICS,OpenSecrets Adds Data On Executive Branch Personal Finances – But White House Officials Have Yet To File Disclosures,"OpenSecrets Blog, ContributorPublished by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics an...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opensecrets-adds-data-on-executive-branch-personal_us_58d3caf4e4b062043ad4b049,"by Alex Baumgart  Today, the Center for Responsive Politics is releasing new personal financial data for members of the Trump",2017-03-23,"<p> <a href=""https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/ivanka-trump"">Ivanka Trump</a>, who now has a West Wing office, and husband <a href=""https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/jared-kushner"">Jared Kushner</a>, senior adviser to President Trump, at a press conference with Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel last week. Kushner has filed a partial disclosure of his holdings, but no other such disclosures by White House officials have been released. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d3cb531d0000d43b7d0003.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale," by Alex Baumgart  Today, the Center for Responsive Politics is releasing new personal financial data for members of the Trump administration. Collected from reports that executive branch nominees are required to submit to the Office of Government Ethics (OGE), the data gives the public an inside look at the financial interests of what is likely the wealthiest cabinet in modern history. The new data is here, with individual profiles available for each of the hyperlinked names (see Donald Trump or Betsy Devos). Each nominee must disclose assets, income and liabilities along with any positions, agreements or arrangements made with organizations other than the U.S. government. So far, we have compiled and digitized reports for the top agency officials whose filings have been publicly released by OGE.This effort represents the beginning of our expanded coverage of the executive branch’s personal financial data. But there’s a big hole: We still await legally required financial disclosures from members of the Executive Office of the President. High-ranking employees have 30 days after taking office to file the reports with White House ethics officials, who then have up to 60 days to review them. The reports are then sent to OGE, which reviews them as well — and has 30 days upon receipt to make them publicly available.So far, the only concrete evidence of White House officials working to comply with their ethics agreements comes in the form of a periodic transaction report from Trump’s senior advisor, Jared Kushner, that was posted late last week.The filing lists a number of assets that Kushner has divested, the first steps he’s taken to adhere to a proposed ethics plan that was first made public in January. That agreement, which a lengthy email communique between Kushner’s lawyers and OGE officials (first obtained by MSNBC through a FOIA request) shed further light on, lays out a framework designed to disentangle Kushner from any possible actual conflicts of interest, or the appearance of them. Included in the string of emails are a number of certificates of divestiture (CDs) for Kushner, his wife (Ivanka Trump), and their dependent children.CDs allow appointees who have been directed to sell assets in order to avoid a conflict of interest to defer paying capital gains tax on them, provided they reinvest the money in “permitted property” — limited government securities or diversified investment funds.In all, Kushner and his immediate family were granted tax deferrals for 14 separate assets. Kushner has so far sold eight of them, according to the transaction report made public last week, for somewhere between $7.7 million and $36.6 million. That money will likely be reinvested. Among the assets sold were 3,754 shares of Signature Bank, a troubled commercial bank with which the Kushner family has a history of doing business. Kushner also sold his stake in a venture capital company owned by his brother that has put seed money into a number projects, including the popular chat software Slack; Oscar, a healthcare insurance company that sold plans on the Obamacare exchange; and — perhaps ironically — OpenGov.com, a software company looking to bolster government transparency.It’s unclear whether Kushner has found a buyer for his remaining stake in his brother’s venture capital company, or his interest in Broadband Proliferation Partners — a company that scores the internet connectivity of commercial buildings. And Kushner’s family’s real estate company is working on a deal to sell much of its interest in its tower at 666 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan to a Chinese insurance company with complicated ties to the government in Beijing. That has stirred controversy; Kushner stands to gain $400 million from the sale.Ivanka Trump also has a number of assets that have yet to be sold, including an investment fund focused on natural gas pipelines; a hedge fund that only the ultrarich can invest in; and BlackRock’s struggling Obsidian hedge fund, which posted a $1.9 billion loss in January. That loss could have an impact on Ivanka’s father as well, given that Donald Trump has somewhere between $5 million and $25 million wrapped up in the fund.Filers need only disclose the value of each of their assets and liabilities within a broad range, which makes it impossible to evaluate with any precision their net worth, how deeply they are invested in an asset, or how much they’re in hock. Further clouding the picture: The highest disclosure range for reporting assets is “above $50,000,000” (and just $1,000,000 when it comes to a spouse’s assets). That means the public can’t know the actual value of billions of dollars in private equity, real estate or other holdings owned by the extraordinarily wealthy members of this administration.Given that Ivanka Trump was given a CD for her holdings in Obsidian, it’s logical to think that the president would divest the asset as well. But Trump has claimed that the conflict-of-interest rules don’t apply to him, and so far there has been no indication that Trump has followed through on the provisions of the ethics plan laid out by his lawyers in January.Questions about Ivanka Trump’s financial holdings have taken on a new importance in light of the recent announcement that she’ll have an expanded role in the administration. As part of that, she’ll gain a permanent office in the White House but she will not become a government employee and thus will be exempt from filing a disclosure form. We have a window into her investments through Kushner’s report, since OGE requires that a spouse’s assets must be disclosed, but spouses are not held to the same disclosure thresholds and requirements.The certificates of divestiture and Kushner’s transaction filing show just the tip of an iceberg of potential conflicts in the Trump White House. Full disclosure forms are necessary to understand the full extent of Kushner’s vested financial interests and ethics agreements, along with the information necessary to determine whether he’s disentangling himself from conflicts. CRP will continue to post this data as OGE makes available the financial filings of members of the executive branch."
49,HEALTHY LIVING,Why Equity Matters For Health,"USAID's Flagship Maternal And Child Survival Program, Contributor(MCSP)",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-equity-matters-for-health_us_58d3d9a2e4b099c777b9df7a,"According to the World Health Organization (WHO), globally, maternal deaths declined from more than 500,000 in 1990 to about",2017-03-23,<p><em>A community health volunteer promoting health messages in Ghana.</em></p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d3d9d9140000290007118c.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"According to the World Health Organization (WHO), globally, maternal deaths declined from more than 500,000 in 1990 to about 289,000 in 2013. Similarly, the number of under-5 deaths worldwide has declined from nearly 12 million in 1990 to 6.9 million in 2011. However, despite overall progress, significant inequities persist.Although some of the Millennium Development Goals were achieved, health economists point out that there is a widening gap between the rich and the poor. (To learn more, please review MCSP’s developed country equity dashboards, which analyze coverage disparities across maternal, newborn and child health by country.)To achieve Sustainable Development Goal 3 – “ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages” – health equity must be intentionally pursued as a strategy; it will not necessarily happen as a byproduct of other development efforts. Commitment to universal health coverage also requires special focus on vulnerable and marginalized populations.The WHO defines health equity as the absence of avoidable or remediable health differences among groups of people, whether those groups are defined socially, economically, demographically, or geographically. David Gwatkin refers to the acronym “PROGRESS” to summarize the different groups that we should focus on: Place of residence, race, occupation, gender, religion, education, socio-economic status.”The Alma-Ata Declaration further discusses equity in its second principle: “The existing gross inequality in the health status of the people particularly between developed and developing countries as well as within countries is politically, social and economically unacceptable and is, therefore, of common concern to all countries.”We see a reflection of this in levels of maternal mortality, which are concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asian countries. An African woman’s lifetime risk of dying from pregnancy-related causes is 100 times higher than that of a woman in a developed country. In sub-Saharan Africa, maternal mortality ratios for the poor are double those for the non-poor, and are consistently higher among rural populations and less- educated women.Moreover, in most countries in the region, rates of skilled attendance at birth are five times higher among the non- poor than among the poor and inequities are not confined to Africa. In India, for example, nearly 9 of 10 women in the richest quintile have skilled assistance during delivery, while only 2 of 10 in the poorest quintile do.It has been recognized that use of promising community-based approaches – including community health workers, task shifting, and bringing services closer to the community – increases health equity. Community-based intervention packages, delivered through community health workers, can substantially increase coverage of multiple high-impact interventions and contribute to reductions in maternal, newborn and child mortality. For example, a study in Bangladesh, showed that neonatal mortality was 67% lower for those who received a home visit on day one than in those who received no home visit at all.Social accountability constitutes another set of promising approaches to achieving health equity. The World Bank defines social accountability as “the obligation of power-holders to account for or take responsibility for their actions and affirms and operationalizes the direct accountability relationships between citizens and the state (or providers).” Social accountability approaches engage communities and community-based workers in the process of measuring the health status of community members, in assessing quality of services, in auditing causes of death, in defining high-risk and vulnerable groups, and in measuring changes in mortality.Often, these approaches emphasize involvement of marginalized and vulnerable populations, thereby, empowering these communities and increasing the voice of disengaged and vulnerable groups. In Rwanda, joint committees comprised of nongovernmental organizations, government officials, and influential community members resulted in changes in provider behavior (punctuality, attendance, waiting times, and confidentiality) and overall improved service delivery.ICHC will have sessions focusing on evidence-based approaches for equity and accountability, including how to intentionally design programs to be pro-equity, how to identify and target vulnerable populations, how to measure equity outcomes, and how to increase citizen voice in service delivery and policymaking. I can’t wait to join these conversations!Tanvi Monga, Senior Program Officer, MCSP/ICFThis blog is part of the Institutionalizing Community Health Conference blog series. We encourage those unable to join the conference to stay virtually connected and to add your voice to the conversation at #HealthForAll.

50,POLITICS,Drop In New Coal Plants Worldwide Could Make A Major Climate Goal Attainable,Hayley Miller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/drop-in-new-coal-plants_us_58d27a88e4b02d33b7473ce0,"Pre-construction plans for coal plants fell 48 percent last year, offering new hope for preventing irreversible climate change.",2017-03-22,"Vendors sit at stalls as smokestacks stand in the background at a coal-fired power plant in Badarpur, Delhi, India, on May 29, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d29e432c00002000fefca6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A new study describes a dramatic worldwide drop in coal-fired power plant construction last year ― an encouraging development that could place some major climate goals within reach.“Boom and Bust 2017: Tracking The Global Coal Plant Pipeline,” a report from the environmental advocacy groups Greenpeace, the Sierra Club and CoalSwarm, found that pre-construction plans for new coal plants around the world fell by 48 percent last year.There was also a 62 percent decline in the number of new construction projects started last year, and a 29 percent drop in completed projects. The study’s authors link the sharp decline to the adoption of tougher environmental policies and shifting economic conditions in India and China, where coal plants are being retired at “an unprecedented pace.”Between 2006 and 2016, India and China accounted for 86 percent of the world’s coal power plant construction, but both countries have reversed course in the past year.According to a Greenpeace survey released earlier this month, the Chinese government ― which has implemented far-reaching restrictions on coal ― approved 85 percent fewer coal power construction projects in 2016 than in 2015.India’s Ministry of Power announced in June that the country had enough coal plants to meet demand through 2019, prompting developers to abandon their coal projects. India has shifted focus to renewable energy and is in the midst of what the “Boom and Bust” authors call a “solar power revolution.”The dramatic worldwide decline in coal power development offers renewed hope for preventing irreversible climate change.The study suggests that holding global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) ― a goal set by the 2016 international climate agreement in Paris ― is possible. But it would require doubling the rate of coal plant retirement, and establishing an even stronger global commitment to expanding clean energy.“An end to the coal plant construction boom brings the possibility of a global phase-out of coal over the coming decades, a prerequisite to reining in climate change,” the authors note. While India and China have been moving away from coal, other countries have not made the same progress. The report lists 10 “hotspots” for continued coal plant construction, including Bangladesh, Japan and Pakistan, which are responsible for 75 percent of the proposed increases in coal power capacity outside China and India.And as much of the developed world increases its efforts to slash fossil fuel production and reduce emissions, President Donald Trump has pledged to revive the U.S. coal industry.Last month, Trump rolled back an Obama administration rule that barred coal mining companies from dumping waste into waterways.“I have already eliminated a devastating anti-coal regulation,” Trump told a crowd of supporters Monday in Kentucky. “And that is just the beginning.”Trump said his administration is preparing new executive orders to expand coal production, and claimed that Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt will turn the agency into a “job creator” for coal miners.Meanwhile, nearly two-thirds of Americans believe the U.S. should focus on developing renewable energy over fossil fuels.How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

But a huge protest that unfolded in Lagos on Wednesday ― World Water Day ― signals their fight is far from over. “I can confirm that most of the anti-people provisions have been removed from the final version of the law,” Akinbode Oluwafemi, deputy executive director for Environmental Rights Action/Friends of the Earth Nigeria, told The Huffington Post in an email this week. But even with the revisions to the law, “it is still not yet uhuru,” Oluwafemi warned in a statement, using the Swahili word for freedom.The United Nations, local activists and citizens alike had reacted strongly to a draft of the Lagos Environment Bill, passed hastily in February by the Lagos State House of Assembly. The bill went after the metropolitan area’s informal water sector ― including local “mai ruwa,” or water vendors, who have been known to charge exorbitant fees ― as well as residents who drill their own boreholes or fetch water from lakes or rivers. According to activists, the draft included language so broad that it would have potentially threatened most residents’ access to drinking water. Lagos, Africa’s most populous city, located in a state of the same name, is the midst of a major water crisis. Only 1 in 10 people have access to water that the state utility provides. Oluwafemi called the state’s proposal a “death sentence.”“When the State fails to provide adequate access to drinking water, no one should be criminalized or fined for fetching water from lakes, rivers, or any other natural sources,” Léo Heller, U.N. special rapporteur on the human rights to water and sanitation, said in a statement last month, adding that the Lagos state government had gone “a step too far.”For decades, the state has “neglected to invest” in water infrastructure in Lagos, Jesse Bragg, spokesman at the nonprofit Corporate Accountability International, explained from Boston earlier this month. It has instead favored the possible privatization of Lagos’ water utility through public-private partnerships, he said ― a plan that has repeatedly been met with public opposition, and has repeatedly failed.Activists felt the draft of the environment bill was a way for the government to push its privatization agenda.“We are particularly worried that the governor will sign a law that practically wills our right to a free gift of nature … to private interests whose sole concern is profits,” said Francis Abayomi, executive director of the Peace and Development Project in Nigeria. Amid the opposition, Lagos lawmakers scrambled to assure their constituents that the bill, which also included provisions related to waste management and other issues, would “benefit all Lagosians.”Akinwunmi Ambode, the governor of Lagos state, said the bill would “result in historic environmental victories” as he signed it into law on March 1. Tunde Braimoh, the House committee chairman on information, strategy and security, added that the bill’s more “contentious” provisions had already been removed before Ambode signed it.However, to the chagrin of environmental and human rights groups, the law’s final language was not made public until almost three weeks later.In a statement last Thursday, a coalition of activist groups called for the government to “stop hiding” the details of the new law. Government officials finally released the law’s language to the public over the weekend.“We are so impressed that the Lagos government allowed the voice of the people to prevail in its decision,” Oluwafemi said in a statement after the revised language was released. “The Governor Ambode administration [is] demonstrating that it is a listening one and we commend this.”But even as they celebrate their victory this week, Oluwafemi and other activists have stressed that they’re not about to rest on their laurels. On Wednesday, World Water Day, hundreds of people gathered in the heart of Lagos to protest water privatization.Organized by the “Our Water, Our Right” coalition, an alliance of several African and international environmental and human rights groups, over 1,000 people were expected to attend the rally. They called on the government to turn its back on privatization and instead use public funding to improve water infrastructure and treatment, as well as welcome public participation in the decision-making process.“This is not the end of the water crisis in Lagos,” Lauren DeRusha, an associate campaign director at Corporate Accountability International, said in an email this week.Speaking on his mobile phone from the rally on Wednesday morning, Philip Jakpor, an activist with Environmental Rights Action/Friends of the Earth Nigeria, said that 500 people had already joined the protest and “many more are joining as we go along.” “We are saying ‘no’ to water privatization,” he said.Jakpor explained that while the “most anti-people” sections of the new environment law were removed and it does include some positive water-related gains ― such as more rigorous regulation on commercial water users ― the legislation still appears to support water privatization “in the long run.”“We still restate our opposition to public-private partnerships in the water sector, which the state is still pressing ahead with,” Oluwafemi said in a statement on Monday. “We are determined to challenge this false solution through lawful means, including public demonstrations, in the days ahead.” See photos from Wednesday’s World Water Day rally in Lagos below. ______Dominique Mosbergen is a reporter at The Huffington Post covering climate change, extreme weather and extinction.

We're wondering that, too.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d281141d0000cf3b7cfc8a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Who knows if a picture is worth a thousand words? That seems awfully specific. But AMC sure as heck proved it’s worth an hour-long episode. On Sunday’s “The Walking Dead” episode, “The Other Side,” we saw Sasha (Sonequa Martin-Green) and Rosita (Christian Serratos) inexplicably give up on trying to snipe Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) from afar in favor of breaking into the Saviors’ facility. If it seems like a terrible plan, that’s because it was.While breaking in, Sasha locked Rosita outside the fence and went in alone. The problem was, there were a lot of Saviors around. Did Sasha make it? Did she die? Did she take down Negan? The suspense was killing us ... until it wasn’t.Nah. She good.In new photos released by AMC, Sasha’s fate is seemingly spoiled. She appears to be chilling in a cell that looks similar to the one Daryl (Norman Reedus) was kept in.From the photos, we can assume Sasha lives. (Yasss!) And we can probably also assume Negan’s still around, too. (Not yasss!)It also doesn’t look like she’s in bad shape, so maybe there wasn’t even much of a struggle. The good news for Sasha: Her predicament doesn’t look as bad as Daryl’s situation. Sasha gets to keep her clothes on, for example. Remember when Daryl was all nakey?It doesn’t seem like much, but clothes are a plus. Also, she apparently has some friendly visitors.It appears Eugene (Josh McDermitt) is going to pay Sasha a visit, assuming she’s in the cell behind that door. Perhaps we’ll finally get an explanation as to why Eugene resisted Rosita and Sasha’s attempts to save him from the Saviors. (Our guess is it was all the sick video games Negan has.)While the photos reveal Sasha is OK for now, comic fans may have noticed similarities between Sasha’s plight and what happened to a character named Holly. In Robert Kirkman’s comics, Holly also became romantically involved with Abraham and was eventually taken captive by the Saviors. It didn’t turn out too well for her."

And it shocked us, but not everyone was seeing that. And the fact that when these shootings happen, it seems like the first thing that happens is that people start to demonize the victim and make excuses for what happened.”“So we felt if we flipped it, it would give people who normally don’t deal with this an opportunity to feel what it’s like to be in our shoes, so to speak,” she continued. “And hopefully empathize and understand so that when it happens you’re not desensitized anymore.”The show’s recurring themes of race and social justice also delve into the related economic effects of federal private prisons and America’s school-to-prison pipeline.Through the years, privately owned prison facilities have faced scrutiny over safety and security, especially in comparison to federally run prisons.Various reports have concluded that students of color face harsher disciplinary action and are more likely to be pushed out of school than their white counterparts ― all of which contributes to America’s increasing mass incarceration rates and the disproportionate number of black and Latino prisoners.“We don’t think people understand and know about the pipeline and what private prisons do and how they make money and how corrupt it is and how it absolutely affects policing,” Prince-Bythewood said. “That was one of the things that we wanted to do with the show is be able to open it up and show this issue from every seat in the house, not just the victims and the families and the police, but how it rises up into the politics and how laws are made and why they’re made to benefit people in power.”“All of this affects the people on the ground. The private prison complex is a horrifying thing,” she added. “And also what happens in our schools and the equity in schools can absolutely affect a child’s chance of living life.”In addition to her hope for the show’s characters to spark more activism in America, the 47-year-old filmmaker also wants politicians and law enforcement officials to take note of the show’s underlying messages to help create a more unified America.“We hope that we give a blueprint,” she said. “Our show isn’t just ten hours of venting, but hopefully at the end of the ten hours we’re offering some thoughts on how things can change.”“Shots Fired” airs Wednesdays at 8/7c on Fox."

The new law will allow students to “voluntarily express religious or political viewpoints in school assignments” and gives religious and political student organizations full control of their internal affairs.Critics say the bill, which reportedly stems from a 2015 decision to remove Christian references from a student production of “A Charlie Brown Christmas,” could be used to discriminate against LGBTQ students.“No student should fear being excluded from a school club or participating in a school activity because they are LGBTQ,” Sarah Warbelow, legal director for the Human Rights Campaign, said in a statement. “While of course private groups should have the freedom to express religious viewpoints, they should not be able to unfairly discriminate with taxpayer funds.”Chris Hartman, director of Kentucky-based LGBTQ advocacy organization Fairness Campaign, told The Washington Blade he was “disappointed in this new law that can potentially further marginalize LGBT students across Kentucky.” Bevin’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.SB17 also ensures that religious groups are allowed equal access to public forums and permits “public schools to sponsor artistic or theatrical programs that advance students’ knowledge of society’s cultural and religious heritage.”Under the law, students are allowed to display religious messages on their clothing and use public school facilities for religious activities. The legislation also permits teachers to use biblical texts in their instruction.The bill was introduced in the state senate in January and passed the Senate and House by votes of 31-3 and 81-8, respectively. With Bevin’s signature, the law will take effect beginning July 1, according to WFPL.Human Rights Campaign is currently tracking anti-LGBTQ legislation introduced in states across the country. In January, Rep. Rick Nelson (D-Ky.) introduced to the Kentucky Senate House Bills 105 and 106, which critics say are aimed to discriminate against members of the LGBTQ community. House Bill 105 says no law or court action may interfere with a person exercising their rights, including the “right of conscience.” Such laws have in the past been used to justify denying certain goods and services to LGBTQ individuals. Nelson’s House Bill 106 would require public schools, state universities, and government buildings to designate that their bathrooms may “only be used by persons based on their biological sex.” Both bills are currently under review by the state judiciary."

The House Oversight & Government Reform Committee has asked for the Trump administration to turn over information pertaining to Flynn having received payments from foreign sources. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d2bf8d1400008806070f21.jpeg?cache=wbJbbD1oqh&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Leaders of the House Oversight & Government Reform Committee on Wednesday asked the Trump administration to turn over all information it has related to payments that former national security adviser Michael Flynn received from foreign governments or other foreign entities.Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) and ranking Democrat Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) asked for the information in a letter sent to the White House, the FBI, the Department of Defense and the director of national intelligence.“The Committee is reviewing whether Lt. General Michael Flynn, the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency and the former National Security Advisor, fully disclosed his payments from Russian, Turkish, or other foreign sources, including but not limited to payments he received from Kremlin-backed media outlet known as RT (formerly Russia Today),” the congressmen say in the letter.Flynn was one of President Donald Trump’s closest advisers during the presidential campaign. He was named national security adviser soon after Trump’s victory, even though there were questions surrounding money he received from the Russian government and his work lobbying for a Turkish businessman. Reports emerged last month showing that Flynn had lied about the topics he had discussed with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the presidential transition period. Flynn became the shortest-serving national security adviser in history when Trump fired him after just 24 days on the job.And after he was fired, Flynn retroactively registered with the Department of Justice as a foreign agent because he had done work for a Turkish businessman before the election. Flynn said he registered to be cautious, apparently believing that his brief public relations work could have been benefitted the Turkish government rather than a private businessman.Anyone seeking the national security clearances Flynn had would need to answer a series of questions related to their relationships with and payments from any foreign source. Flynn would have been asked to list all of his foreign contacts, his foreign financial entanglements, any work for or advice given to foreign businesses, governments or clients, and any job offers extended by a foreign national.The House Oversight & Government Reform Committee leaders have asked for several documents pertaining to this clearance process, including Flynn’s answers to the questionnaire any communications or records of payment Flynn may have disclosed. Flynn’s foreign agent registration documents indicate that his consulting firm received more than $500,000 for its work on behalf of the Turkish government. News reports indicate that the Russian-backed television station RT paid Flynn $33,750 to travel to Moscow in December 2015. The reports also indicate that Flynn received $11,250 each from Kaspersky Labs, a Russian cybersecurity firm, and from an air cargo company affiliated with the Volga-Dnepr Group, which is owned by a Russian businessman. Both payments were for speeches he gave in 2015.The payments from RT and the Russian-linked businesses were provided to Flynn through his speaking agency, Leading Authorities, Inc. In their letter, Chaffetz and Cummings also ask for documents related to Leading Authorities, Inc. Previously, the two congressmen sent a letter to the company asking for any documentation related to Flynn’s speaking engagements and payments."
61,POLITICS,It’s Not Just Conservatives Upset About Trumpcare. Another GOP Faction Is Too.,Laura Barrón-López,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/moderate-republicans-trumpcare_us_58d2bf1de4b0f838c62eca79,An increasing number of moderates are breaking with the president and party leadership over the bill.,2017-03-22,Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.) at a congressional hearing this month.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d2c1971d0000f42c7cfdc0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Moderate House Republicans are having a crisis of faith over the GOP plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act: Do they take the plunge and support a bill that could leave 24 million people uninsured? Or do they break with their new president and vote against Trumpcare, potentially stirring re-election revenge?After multiple meetings with President Donald Trump and House GOP leadership, a number of prominent moderates abandoned ship Wednesday night, announcing their opposition to Trumpcare. Moments after leaving the office of House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.) announced he will vote against the bill. Dent leads the moderate Tuesday Group, which includes roughly 54 Republicans members. “I cannot support this bill and will oppose it,” Dent said in a statement. “I believe this bill, in it’s current form, will lead to the loss of coverage and make insurance unaffordable for too many Americans, particularly for low-to-moderate income and older individuals.”Dent’s decision came as members of the House Freedom Caucus huddled late into the night, engaging the White House directly in negotiations. A deal still hadn’t been announced as a number of conservatives trekked over to the White House on Thursday morning for one final meeting with Trump before the vote. If Freedom Caucus members are successful in winning concessions from Trump ― by bypassing Ryan ― those tweaks would likely alienate moderates even more. Indeed, as conservatives hinted they could be close to a deal, more moderates came out against the bill. New Jersey Republicans Frank LoBiondo and Chris Smith joined Dent in announcing the would oppose the plan even with the latest changes. “This bill does not meet the standards of what was promised; it is not as good as or better than what we currently have,” LoBiondo said, admitting that the ACA is a better option. A day earlier, Dent told Trump that efforts to defund family planning provider Planned Parenthood should be dealt with separately, and he expressed concern that the House bill doesn’t make tax credits more generous for older and low-income people to offset increased insurance premiums. He also handed the president a letter that four Republican governors had sent to House Republicans saying they oppose the plan for its lack of flexibility and resources for states that expanded Medicaid. “It was a soft sell, not a hard sell,” Dent said of Trump’s talk with him and 12 other, primarily moderate, members on Tuesday. “Whether or not minds are changed, I can’t speak to that.”Unlike the House Freedom Caucus, whose conservative base expects members to clash with House leadership, moderate members could stand to lose the most in next year’s congressional elections. Trump himself appeared to hammer this point in the larger meeting on Tuesday morning, calling out not only Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), but moderate Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.), warning that Republicans could suffer in 2018 if they don’t pass something. Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), who supports the Trumpcare legislation crafted by House leadership, said Trump’s message to members wasn’t threatening, but was an “incredibly effective presentation politically and personally.”“We got to win and he made that abundantly clear,” Cole said. Still, the eight-term Republican admitted the outcome of the vote “is still in the air.”Pressed on the atmosphere among moderates who could lose their seats if they help pass a bill that ends up hurting their constituents, Cole said he thinks they’d “get a lot more hurt if you don’t get something done.”“It’s a mistake for anybody to draw lines in the sand right now if you’re a Republican member,” Cole said.“You got to keep the process going, but if you kill the baby in the cradle, there’s not going to be any product here, and I think then you have to go home and explain why you were right, and the president and the speaker and the chairman of the committees of jurisdiction were all wrong, and you know more,” Cole continued. “Maybe some guys can do that, but I think that’s a tough sell for most Republican primary voters. They’re going to put their faith in the president, the speaker and the fact that most of your colleagues voted for it.”But Trump’s pitch didn’t appear to flip even the members he singled out during his visit to the Capitol.King told reporters a few hours after the meeting that changes to the bill so far are “not that big a help” to his district, so he’s still undecided.Rep. Dan Donovan (R-N.Y.) said he pretty much knows how he will vote, but wouldn’t reveal his decision. “There are portions of it that I have great concerns with,” Donovan said. Calls to his office are running about 1,000-to-1 against the Republican plan, though Donovan said he couldn’t be sure all the calls are from his district.Donovan quipped that if his colleagues are making decisions based on re-election they should “go do something else.”“I would hate to think somebody would vote against their conscience and against the interests of their constituents because they’re afraid of not getting re-elected 18 months later,” Donovan said.Republican leaders attempted to sway a number of New York moderates with a sweetheart deal on Monday meant to change the Medicaid funding formula to help out rural counties. And Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.) is working with Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) to improve tax credits for older Americans ― a major point of contention for moderates.Still, it appears many members are holding out for different tweaks, making it a huge feat for leadership to persuade enough to back the rapidly pieced-together bill speeding through Congress. ”I’m a no,” moderate Rep. Leonard Lance (R-N.J.) said Tuesday. “The word is a simple, two-letter word. The word is no.”The HuffPost whip count breaks opposition to the Republican health care bill into multiple categories. House Freedom Caucus members helped HuffPost identify who was so strongly against the legislation that pressure from Trump would not swing them. While we have not independently verified the positions of every member on the list, we have verified most of them, and are basing some predictions on other members’ knowledge.Ryan Grim contributed reporting.This article has been updated with more details ahead of the Thursday vote."

Caughman had been rummaging through the garbage outside of a Manhattan building when Jackson attacked him.Bleeding profusely, Caughman managed to walk to a nearby police precinct. He was rushed to a local hospital where he later died, according to WPIX TV. A little more than 24 hours after the stabbing, Jackson allegedly marched into the Times Square NYPD substation and turned himself in, saying he was planning to attack an interracial couple. He also allegedly revealed his hatred for black men dating white women motivated him to carry out Monday’s attack.“You need to arrest me. I have the knife in my coat,” he told officers, according to the New York Daily News.NBC New York reports that police recovered a 26-inch mini sword on Jackson’s body, which they believe was the weapon he used to kill Caughman.According to Gothamist, Manhattan Chief of Detectives William Aubry told reporters Wednesday during an unrelated press briefing that Jackson took a Bolt Bus on Friday from Baltimore, Maryland to NYC. He spent the weekend in a Manhattan hotel before fatally stabbing Caughman on Monday.“He was specifically intending to target male blacks for assault,” Aubry said. “He has been harboring these types of feelings for quite some time. For well over 10 years.”Aubry said Jackson chose to execute his attack in New York because it’s the “media capital of the world” and wanted to make a statement.The NYPD confirmed to Huffington Post that Jackson was arrested and charged with murder. NBC notes that while he was initially arrested on a second-degree murder charge, authorities want to classify the act as a hate crime and upgrade the charge to first-degree murder.Jackson reportedly served in the U.S. Army in Germany and Afghanistan, before being honorably discharged in 2012.Caughman’s Twitter account describes him as a “businessman” and reveals he had a passion for collecting celebrity autographs. His friends and neighbors told the New York Post that he was a hard-working man who spent his days collecting bottles and cans. "

67,POLITICS,Supreme Court Snubs Neil Gorsuch Right In The Middle Of His Confirmation Hearing,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-neil-gorsuch-disability-rights_us_58d27f3de4b02d33b74747e4,Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee let him know all about it.,2017-03-22,It was not a great moment for the Supreme Court nominee.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d2abd91d0000f42c7cfd59.jpeg?cache=Tgo5GCZRjT&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Something unusual happened as Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch was testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday. His would-be future colleagues took a swipe at his past work.As Gorsuch was essentially interviewing for a job on the high court, the justices roundly rejected a legal standard that he’d embraced in a 2008 disability rights case. In a unanimous ruling, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that the standard, which sets a particularly low bar for schools’ responsibility to students with disabilities, is not good enough.“When all is said and done, a student offered an educational program providing ‘merely more than de minimis’ progress from year to year can hardly be said to have been offered an education at all,” Roberts wrote.The case before the justices concerned the level of educational benefit that public schools must provide under the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. “Merely more than de minimis” was the standard observed in the current case by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, Gorsuch’s court.“For children with disabilities, receiving instruction that aims so low would be tantamount to sitting idly ... awaiting the time when they were old enough to drop out,” Roberts added.Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee immediately jumped on the ruling issued Wednesday morning. They began pressing Gorsuch about it, emphasizing the word “merely” ― a word that had attracted the justices’ attention as well during oral arguments. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) called the ruling “powerful.”“Why in your early decision did you want to lower the bar so low ... as a standard for public education to meet this federal requirement under the law?” Durbin asked Gorsuch. The judge noted that he had just seen the ruling during a quick break in the confirmation hearing.“If I was wrong, Senator, I was wrong because I was bound by circuit precedent, and I’m sorry,” Gorsuch said. He noted that the ruling in the 2008 case had been unanimous and that one of his fellow judges on that case was a Democratic nominee.“To me, you were actually the first in this case that you wrote to come up with this standard and then you added the word ‘merely,’” said Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.). She later said that Gorsuch’s addition of that word “creates a ceiling ... more than a floor” for the benefits that students with disabilities receive under the law.Gorsuch responded that he was simply following precedent in the 10th Circuit. He said, “I disagree,” when Klobuchar charged that his ruling made the standard more stringent. “It’s not a surprise to me,” she said, that the Supreme Court rejected the lower court’s language unanimously.Republicans on the committee rushed to Gorsuch’s defense. Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) sent out an advisory to reporters stating that the judge “did not invent that legal test” and that he relied on a 1996 decision from his own circuit. The advisory added that Gorsuch’s addition of “merely” didn’t change the protections for students with disabilities.Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) argued that Gorsuch was simply following guidance from the Supreme Court and other courts at the time.“Yes, sir. I follow orders,” Gorsuch said. That answer, Cruz said, “should give comfort that you would continue to do so as a Supreme Court justice.”During oral arguments in January, several justices puzzled over who came up with the standard that they later rejected. “Who invented it?” asked Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.In Wednesday’s ruling, the Supreme Court said that kids with disabilities must be offered an educational program that is “reasonably calculated to enable a child to make progress appropriate in light of the child’s circumstances.” This standard, the court said, is fact-specific and depends on “the unique circumstances of the child.”Disability rights advocates praised the ruling.Jeff Perkins, the father of the child with autism at the center of the case Gorsuch decided in 2008, is set to testify against the judge’s confirmation on Thursday."

In 2013, he told The Guardian that his experiences growing up in Compton, California, around the Black Panthers were different from the negative portrayals that were often made of the group. “My memory of the Panthers, for instance, is very different from most people’s because as a kid I remember them on my street, and how nice they treated me,” he recalled. “Free breakfast program, free schools, outreach and community work, gang members working hand in hand, Crips and Bloods.”“They invited me to go get breakfast every day,” he said. “Then there’s the other great divide going on again because my mom’s like: ‘Oh, you’re not going there, nuh-uh.’”Lionsgate’s Codeblack acquired the film rights to Angela Davis: An Autobiography last year.Whitaker’s involvement with Davis’ motion picture will follow his production credits on “Fruitvale Station” and Roxanne Shanté’s upcoming biopic, “Roxanne Roxanne.”"

The images, taken when the spacecraft was 280,000 miles (450,000 kilometers) away, show features as small as 1.4 miles (2.2 kilometers).",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d2c04a1d0000cf3b7cfdb9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A team of scientists seeking to restore Pluto to planethood launched a campaign on Tuesday to broaden the astronomical classifications which led to its demotion to a “dwarf planet” a decade ago.Six scientists from institutions across the United States argued that Pluto deserves to be a full planet, along with some 110 other bodies in the solar system, including Earth’s moon.In a paper presented at an international planetary science conference at The Woodlands, Texas, the scientists explained that geological properties, such as shape and surface features, should determine what constitutes a planet.In 2006, the International Astronomical Union, struggling with how to classify a newly discovered icy body beyond Pluto, adopted a definition for a planet based on characteristics that include clearing other objects from its orbital path.Pluto and its newfound kin in the solar system’s distant Kuiper Belt region were reclassified as dwarf planets, along with Ceres, the biggest object in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. The decision left the solar system with eight planets.But this definition sidelines the research interests of most planetary scientists, said the paper’s lead author, Kirby Runyon, a doctoral candidate at Johns Hopkins University.Runyon said he and other planetary scientists are more interested in a planet’s physical characteristics, such as its shape and whether it has mountains, oceans and an atmosphere.“If you’re interested in the actual intrinsic properties of a world, then the IAU definition is worthless,” he said by phone. Runyon and colleagues argue that the IAU does not have the authority to set the definition of a planet.“There’s a teachable moment here for the public in terms of scientific literacy and in terms of how scientists do science,” Runyon added. “And that is not by saying, ‘Let’s agree on one thing.’ That’s not science at all.”Runyon’s group advocates for a sub-classification system, similar to biology’s hierarchal method. This approach would categorize Earth’s moon as a type of planet.That idea irks California Institute of Technology astronomer Mike Brown, who discovered the Kuiper Belt object that cast Pluto out of the planet club. “It really takes blinders to not look at the solar system and see the profound differences between the eight planets in their stately circular orbits and then the millions and millions of tiny bodies flitting in and out between the planets and being tossed around by them,” he wrote in an email."

As it turned out, the moment is very subtle, but it still sparked controversy in the Southeast Asian Malaysia, a majority-Muslim nation of 30 million.After Disney stated in no uncertain terms that it would not allow the film to be censored for Malaysian audiences, the country’s New Straits Times reported Tuesday that “Beauty and the Beast” will be released, uncut, on March 30.At the box office, the scene hasn’t hurt the film in the slightest ― it’s raked in a hefty $400 million worldwide since its Friday debut. In the upcoming “Power Rangers,” which opens March 24, another character is shown front-and-center questioning her sexuality. The Yellow Ranger, called Trini, played by Becky G, is suspected of having “boyfriend problems” until it’s revealed the issue may actually be related to a girlfriend, according to The Hollywood Reporter.As LeFou is being called the first gay character in a Disney movie, Trini is characterized as the first gay character in a superhero film. After the battle over “Beauty and the Beast,” though, things may not have looked good for “Power Rangers” fans in Malaysia. But that film, too, has been cleared by censors, Variety reported Wednesday, citing a statement from the film’s Malaysian distributor.Depictions of gay people in Malaysia are only allowed if they show the character repenting or dying. As The Huffington Post previously reported, Malaysia is known for its regressive stance on LGBTQ rights, having condemned homosexuality under both the country’s federal and religious justice systems. Those dole out punishments that may include whipping or up to a 20-year imprisonment.LGBTQ characters remain woefully underrepresented in most Hollywood film. But the idea that they may not necessarily be erased in theaters abroad ― in the few times they appear on screen ― is an encouraging sign for the gay rights movement everywhere."

Committee members questioned him on his opinions relating to overtime rules.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d28d321d0000cf3b7cfcd3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― One of the biggest questions hanging over the confirmation hearing of Alexander Acosta on Wednesday was where President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Labor Department stands on the issue of overtime pay.Acosta gave some surprisingly revealing answers to that question ― and they don’t bode well for the monumental overtime reforms made by former President Barack Obama, which are now tied up in court.Before he left office, Obama tried to change overtime law so that millions more salaried workers would be eligible for time-and-a-half pay when they work more than 40 hours in a week. His administration sought to do that by raising what’s known as the overtime salary threshold ― the level below which everybody is entitled to overtime pay, regardless of their job duties.The current salary level, set by the George W. Bush administration, is just $23,660 per year, meaning you probably aren’t entitled to overtime pay if you make more than that. Obama tried to roughly double the threshold, to $47,476 per year. That would have brought overtime protections to an additional 4.2 million workers, according to White House estimates.When Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) asked Acosta about the rule, the former National Labor Relations Board member suggested Obama’s reforms were too aggressive and too costly to employers.“The overtime rule hasn’t been updated since 2004,” Acosta said, referencing the Bush changes. “We now see an update [Obama’s] that is a very large revision. Something that needs to be considered is the impact it has on the economy.” He added that he was concerned about the “stress” Obama’s reform could place on nonprofits and employers in low-wage areas.Acosta did say he was “sensitive” to the fact that the overtime reforms hadn’t been updated in so long, suggesting he was open to a more modest change that would give at least some workers new protections. But he did not venture anywhere near the reforms laid out by Obama.Pressed by Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) for a particular salary threshold, Acosta suggested the possibility of adjusting the 2004 level for inflation.“If you were to apply a straight inflation adjustment, I believe the figure if it were updated would be somewhere around $33,000,” he said.If the Trump administration were to do that, millions fewer workers would get overtime protections than they would have under Obama’s reforms. A federal judge issued a temporary injunction against the Obama rules shortly before they went into effect. What happens now is largely in the hands of the current administration. They could go to bat for Obama’s rules in court; they could refuse to defend them and hope they die there; or they could rewrite them so that they’re more friendly to employers and less generous to workers.Judging from Acosta’s answers, the third possibility looks awfully likely.Acosta, who served as the head of the Justice Department’s civil rights division under Bush, is expected to be confirmed as labor secretary. Trump’s original nominee for the post, fast-food CEO Andy Puzder, withdrew his nomination last month amid of a swirl of controversies.How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

72,GREEN,Trump Won't Save Us From Climate Change. Maybe Surfers Will.,Lydia O'Connor,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/surfing-climate-change-donald-trump_us_58c05f3be4b0d1078ca38474,“Surfers will be the canaries in the coal mine on climate change.”,2017-03-22,Surfers are in a unique position to help fund climate change research.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d1c0971d0000cf3b7cfb72.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For surfers, countering President Donald Trump’s plan to slash federal funding for climate change research is personal. Surfers, no strangers to environmental activism around events like World Water Day, are creating task forces to save the ocean, their multimillion-dollar industry and the scientific research that shows both face incredible threats if global temperatures continue to rise. “Surfers are kind of like a giant tribe, a giant worldwide tribe of people,” said Terry Hardy, a longtime surfer and one of the owners of the World Surf League (WSL), the governing body for professional surfers. “We feel like we have an army we can activate that can create real change.”The athletes Hardy represents have a lot at stake. If the sea level continues to rise, as scientists warn, there will be a serious consequence for the sport: smaller and fewer waves. Consistently higher tides will change the way waves break on reefs and beaches, explained Stefanie Sekich-Quinn, coastal preservation manager of Surfrider Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to the protection of the ocean and coasts. For beach breaks, “they’ll break closer to the shore, closer inland, and that means that they could be smaller waves or not break at all,”Sekich-Quinn explained. “The same goes for waves that break on a reef. When the reef is being inundated with additional levels of sea level rise, the wave just won’t break as it used to, and some fear it might not break at all.”Without climate change intervention, those effects could become apparent in as a little as 50 years, she warned.While that threat looms, surfers and other ocean enthusiasts are already grappling with polluted water caused by sewage overflow linked to higher temperatures.“As the climate changes, we’re starting to see more intense and frequent storms,” Sekich-Quinn said, pointing to California’s intensely wet winter, which scientists have pointed to as a symptom of climate change. Infrastructure unable to handle that much water can give way, sending massive amounts of sewage into the ocean. Last month, heavy rains led to a sewage spill that closed popular beaches in Long Beach, and a study from Climate Central found such incidents may become more common.Last April, Hardy’s organization launched WSL Progressive Understanding and Respect for the Environment, or WSL PURE, a foundation dedicated to funding ocean research. In its first move, the no-overhead-costs foundation co-chaired by Hardy contributed $1.6 million for research at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.WSL PURE has continued to collect money from influential people in the surfing community, said Hardy, who hopes to partner with more scientists and eventually establish the foundation as “a centralized hub for ocean-related science, health and advocacy.”As those environmental concerns become more politicized, private donors, such as those now involved with WSL PURE, will realize they need to take on a bigger role endowing science, Hardy predicts.“Private funding is going to become more important for research in general, whether it’s health research or environmental research,” he said. “We’re interested in making sure that the good work that’s going on, that there’s not lapses because of loss of funding.”And when it comes to doling out money, data suggest many surfers are equipped to help fund research. According to one national survey conducted by Surfrider of more than 5,000 respondents, the average surfer in the U.S. earns $75,000 a year. With its climate change efforts, the surfing community joins the likes of former Vice President Al Gore, who in January announced he would host his own climate change summit after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention abruptly canceled one it had been planning for months.Trump’s presidency has upped the stakes, surf activists say.“This is a whole new dawn of the day right now for us,” Sekich-Quinn said. “What we’re starting to see is this new administration is certainly not friendly toward climate change, and therefore we need to increase what we’re doing on the ground.”In January, she said, Surfrider released a “climate change activist toolkit” and trained nearly 50 people to conduct outreach and activism in their communities. Trump has already lost one battle with some surfer activists. The Save the Waves Coalition (STW), another surf conservation organization, has been leading a campaign called #NatureTrumpsWalls against a controversial seawall the Trump International Golf Links wants to build on a public beach to protect its golf resort in western Ireland. Following arguments from activists that the wall would harm the habitat of a rare prehistoric snail and affect surfing and recreation at the beach, the Trump organization withdrew its bid. But the fight continues, the coalition’s director of programs, Nick Mucha, says. Trump’s team has submitted another wall proposal that STW and others are currently fighting. While they await the decision on the second proposal, STW plans to release a cell phone app this year that will let surfers collect their own data for research.“[I]t will allow surfers around the world to take photos of their observed issues, geotag that issue, and create a repository of coastal information that can be used to support partner organizations and informed policy decisions around climate change,” Mucha wrote in an email to The Huffington Post. “Surfers will be the canaries in the coal mine on climate change.”CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misquoted Terry Hardy as saying “wolf-like tribe of people.” He said “worldwide tribe of people.”"

The House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on the GOP’s replacement bill Thursday, the seventh anniversary of the original law’s passage in 2010.Health Care for America Now, a labor union-backed umbrella group that played a key role in Obamacare’s enactment, is coordinating the day’s actions. It estimates that thousands of activists will turn out to protest the Republican legislation.The new bill offers tax breaks to wealthy Americans and insurance and drug companies “on the backs of our seniors and families,” HCAN co-director Margarida Jorge said in a statement. “Americans from coast to coast know there’s too much at stake for themselves, their families and millions across the country to allow this bill to pass.”The rally at 1 p.m. in D.C., which is being organized by the foundation-funded HCAN ally the Center for Popular Democracy and other groups, will feature speeches by Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), deputy chair of the Democratic National Committee, as well as Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards and Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union. Attendees will gather at Freedom Plaza to hear the speakers and then march to the Trump International Hotel and the White House, where activists plan to perform acts of civil disobedience. Later in the day, Ellison, who is also co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, plans to hold a press conference on the Republican bill with several CPC members outside the Capitol building.A mass protest in Chicago’s Federal Plaza will focus on House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who was originally slated to visit the city to attend a fundraiser for Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner (R).And at the district offices of several House Republicans, activists plan to protest the ACA’s repeal by setting up mock emergency rooms. The theatrical gesture aims to show how the drop in insurance coverage from the law’s repeal ― an estimated 24 million people would become uninsured by 2026 under the GOP plan ― would overwhelm emergency rooms as uninsured Americans seek care there.AARP intends to stage its own colorful protest of the repeal bill Thursday morning at the Capitol South Metro stop outside the House office buildings. The nation’s largest seniors group plans to have people dressed as “Charlie the Squirrel,” a character in its video ads opposing repeal, distribute flyers with AARP’s talking points against the bill. In the ads, Charlie is the comedic companion of a middle-aged American upset about a feature of the Republican legislation that would allow insurers to charge older people five times more than younger people for premiums. Since the bill’s age-based tax credits are not enough to make up the difference, AARP has dubbed the provision the “age tax.”The planned demonstrations follow a Wednesday protest by House Democrats against Obamacare repeal on Capitol Hill. Former Vice President Joe Biden attended the rally, predicting that the Republican bill is “not gonna pass.”House Democrats have decided not to throw up last-minute procedural obstacles to delay the bill, according to Politico. The caucus has instead calculated that it is best to let Republicans vote on the legislation and suffer whatever political consequences ensue."

But there was also frustration, primarily that Comey took so long to make a public declaration despite doing so quickly when it came to Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server.“I think the Justice Department needs to give this a close look, which apparently the [inspector general] is doing, and figure out what rules and procedures need to be put in place so it never happens again,” said Robby Mook, Clinton’s presidential campaign manager.Monday’s testimony by Comey was heavy on drama and light on details. But those details were explosive. The FBI director confirmed the investigation into ties between Trump and Russia, revealed that it had started in July and admitted that Russian interests were indeed trying to get Trump elected.For the central players of the 2016 campaign, the testimony reopened old wounds. Brian Fallon, Clinton’s campaign press secretary, called it “reassuring” to see Russia’s involvement be treated with the severity the campaign insisted it deserved. But, like Mook, he couldn’t get beyond the apparent double standard. “There were two active investigations involving presidential candidates last year, and he only told the voters about one,” Fallon said. For Comey, the hearing was something else entirely: another chapter in his complicated, dramatically shifting standing within D.C. political circles. The FBI director is known for his stoicism and sense of fairness that has, for critics, taken on an air of pomposity and self-aggrandizement. His reputation suffered during the campaign. He alienated Trump supporters by declining to press charges over Clinton’s email use while alienating Clinton supporters for even discussing the matter. He then infuriated those Clinton supporters once more by revealing the discovery of additional emails just 10 days before the election, only to announce a week later that nothing new had been found.Democratic leadership and legal officials were incensed by his conduct. Then-Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) wrote a blistering letter accusing Comey of sitting on salacious material tying Trump to Russia and potentially violating the Hatch Act, which prohibits electioneering by federal officials. That Comey refused to confirm an investigation into Trump was taking place even as evidence of Russian connections mounted only raised the level of pique. That he explained his reticence on Monday as being the byproduct of care for the “sensitivity of the matter” ― seemingly the inverse of his reasoning for discussing Clinton’s emails ― didn’t mollify those critics. Reid, according to a source close to him, felt “vindicated” watching Comey but also “frustrated as to why Comey didn’t think the American people deserved to know this before the election.” But despite their reservations, Democrats also recognize that Comey ― at least for the time being ― remains in his post (he’s in the midst of a 10-year term that began in September 2013) and that post is one of the few institutional checks that can be applied on the administration. Monday’s hearing showed that some lawmakers were willing to turn pages so long as they view the FBI director as acting as a responsible bulwark. “He is who we have to work with,” said Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas), a member of the intelligence committee. “I hope and believe that he’ll work in a professional manner, that there will be no partisan considerations. Of course, Democrats across the country and many Americans who were not part of the Democratic Party were frustrated by how events went down during the presidential campaign. But, if you noticed yesterday, I don’t think there was a single question asked about that issue.”“It’s only natural for us to want to go back and relive the elections,” said Rep. Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.). “But that’s not going to happen. It’s about moving forward in the future. I think my Republican colleagues said it best when they said it happened to Democrats this time, it may very well happen to Republicans in the future, and that’s why it’s important to seek the truth.”The hearing also showed that Comey recognizes that he has a reputation to rebuild as well. Unlike his handling of the Clinton email saga ― when, feeling obligated to keep Congress abreast on a potential development in the investigation, he sent a letter that tossed the news cycle into chaos days ahead of the election ― this time around he didn’t promise lawmakers ongoing updates on the status of the Russian probe. And yet skepticism of Comey among Democrats remains, even if Democrats recognize that he may be their best asset against Trump. The cost of his selective disclosure was, in their minds, the presidency and all of the ramifications that winning that office entails. Coming out months later to acknowledge that yes, both candidates were under investigation during the campaign, did not repair Comey’s reputation, it raised further questions.“I think for everybody who saw it yesterday or watched it last night, the hardest thing for people to try and deal with is the issue of, you went out 10 days before the election with this stuff on Hillary and yet ― what was it, July? ― you were informed that espionage and potential treason was going on and everybody was mum on that,” said Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D-Va.) in an interview with The Huffington Post. “They do not understand how you can go out on this one issue, which turned out to be absolutely nothing, and on the other hand you have a foreign government acting treasonous with espionage potentially going on and nobody says a word about it.”With reporting by Laura Barron-Lopez"
75,POLITICS,Republicans Just Made It Easier For Employers To Hide Workplace Injuries,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-just-made-it-easier-for-employers-to-hide-workplace-injuries_us_58d2de35e4b0f838c62f1fc9,They used an arcane procedural maneuver to repeal a significant safety regulation issued by the Obama administration.,2017-03-22,Senate Republicans voted Wednesday to strike down a rule that requires large employers to keep an ongoing record of health and safety incidents.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58d2dea02c00002100fefdef.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The Republican-led Congress moved to dismantle yet another corporate regulation on Wednesday, in a move that safety experts say will make it easier for employers to hide serious workplace injuries from the government.The Senate voted 50-48 to strike down a rule issued late in Barack Obama’s presidency that requires large employers to keep an ongoing record of health and safety incidents. The Obama administration issued the rule in an effort to solidify what it considered long-standing policy at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.By doing away with the rule, Republicans are effectively cutting down the length of time that employers in dangerous industries are required to keep injury records ― from five years to just six months. Former OSHA officials say that doesn’t provide enough time to identify recurring problems with particular employers or industries.They also say the change gives unscrupulous employers little incentive to keep an accurate log of injuries, since it will be more difficult for them to be penalized for not doing so. When employers have a track record of such injuries, it can lead to higher workers’ compensation costs and more government scrutiny.“This will give license to employers to keep fraudulent records and to willfully violate the law with impunity,” said Debbie Berkowitz, a former OSHA policy adviser now with the National Employment Law Project, an advocacy group for low-wage workers.After the House passed its own bill to repeal the rule, the Republican-led Senate needed only a simple majority to do its part. That’s because they used an arcane procedural tool known as a “resolution of disapproval” under the Congressional Review Act of 1996, and such resolutions cannot be filibustered by the minority party. Republicans have wielded that law in a full-scale assault on corporate regulations in recent weeks. Since President Donald Trump took office, they have moved to repeal more than a dozen Obama-era rules by using resolutions of disapproval, covering things such as gun control, pollution and workplace safety. Until this year, the Congressional Review Act had been used successfully only once, when Republicans spiked a different OSHA regulation in 2001.Trump is expected to eventually sign the repeal bill that the Senate approved Wednesday. His administration has carried out its own blitz against the regulatory framework, issuing executive actions that make it more difficult for agencies to create federal rules reining in corporations. Trump’s chief strategist, Stephen Bannon, has described his governing philosophy as “deconstruction” of the administrative state.The OSHA record-keeping rule may sound technical and obscure, but workplace safety advocates say it has wide-reaching implications. Under OSHA rules, certain large employers in high-hazard industries have to keep an accurate record of injuries going back five years. The data helps OSHA figure out where recurring problems are and how to use its limited resources to enforce the law. But a court ruled in 2012 that because of the way OSHA’s founding law was written, the agency has only six months to issue a citation from the time the record-keeping violation occurred. This creates a big problem for inspectors. If they discover, for instance, that an employer has been hiding repetitive motion injuries for several years, they can only hold the employer accountable for the last few months of record fudging.The Obama administration issued the record-keeping rule to address the court ruling and clarify the five-year window. By striking the rule down, Republicans will be leaving OSHA with just the six months. Former OSHA officials say that is not enough time. As it is, OSHA has so little staff that it would take more than a hundred years for the agency to inspect every workplace in the country.As Jordan Barab, a former OSHA official under Obama, put it, “Without being able to enforce any violation within the five-year period, enforcement of recordkeeping accuracy would be almost impossible.” Safety hawks weren’t the only ones who objected to Republicans killing the rule. On Sunday, two former commissioners of the Bureau of Labor Statistics sent a letter to senators urging them not to pass the bill. One was Erica Groshen, who served under Obama; the other was Kathleen Utgoff, who served under George W. Bush. Their interest was obvious: The BLS is the agency responsible for collecting and releasing the official data about work and the economy. Such a repeal “will likely have unintended and unfortunate consequences on the collection of injury data,” Groshen and Utgoff wrote. “If this legislation passes, responsible employers who accurately record workplace injuries will be at a disadvantage competing with employers who do not maintain accurate records.”The record-keeping rule isn’t the first workplace safety regulation that Republicans voted to repeal this month. They also used the Congressional Review Act to kill an Obama regulation that made it harder for companies to secure federal contracts if they had a history of endangering workers. Trump has not yet signed or vetoed it."

On Sunday, he defeated far-right National Front leader Marine Le Pen in the country’s presidential election with a decisive lead. Macron’s rise is one of the more unpredictable aspects of an election campaign that has been mired in bizarre scandal and controversy. At 39 years old, he will be the youngest leader in modern French history, and its first to not come from an establishment party.Macron is a former member of the Socialist Party who served as economy minister for just two years under President Francois Hollande, and was a banker for Rothschild & Company prior to entering politics. Before the presidential election, he had never run for elected office. Despite Macron’s lack of experience, his newly founded political movement, En Marche! ― or “Onward!” ― rapidly gained supporters. He took a radical message of criticizing France’s political class as ineffectual and corrupt, but applied it to a restrained centrist platform based mostly on moderate economic reforms. It was an odd combination, but these are odd times in French politics. As support for the Socialist left crumbled and corruption allegations hobbled the conservative Republicans ― two parties that have made up France’s political establishment ― France’s presidential election campaign opened. On April 30, Macron and Le Pen made it through the first round of the vote, advancing to the runoff on May 7. The two rivals shared an outsider status, but had radically different visions for France’s future. Le Pen had vowed to take France out of the eurozone and return to the franc as a national currency. She said she’d hold a referendum on European Union membership, as well as introduce anti-Islam and anti-immigration policies. Mimicking the campaign of U.S. President Donald Trump, she promised to pursue a “French first” agenda, and her election would have been a devastating blow to the EU. Macron, on the other hand, ran as a moderate reformer and called for France to take a leading role in reinvigorating the EU. He tried to pull usually polarized French politics to the center at a time when far-right populist parties across Europe are becoming increasingly prominent. His victory is a relief for pro-EU figures like German Chancellor Angela Merkel who have become frequent targets for the far-right amid the refugee crisis and Brexit.Macron’s candidacy was initially dismissed as a sideshow when he announced in November of last year that he would enter the race. At the time, it was assumed that whoever won the Republican Party primary would have a fairly clear road to the presidency. But Republican candidate Francois Fillon had a disastrous campaign and faced a formal investigation to see whether he paid his family hundreds of thousands of euros in taxpayer money for jobs they never actually worked. In addition to Fillon’s woes, deeply unpopular Hollande of the Socialist Party was not seeking a second term ― something that no French leader has done since the nation’s fifth republic was created in 1958. Hollande’s administration has left the traditionally powerful Socialists in shambles and their candidate Benoit Hamon suffered a disastrous defeat in the first round. The French press has also given much exposure to the charismatic Macron, leading other party officials to accuse them of playing favorites. The tabloids, meanwhile, additionally homed in on Macron’s relationship with his wife Brigitte, who is his former high school teacher and 24 years his senior. The two appeared on the cover of Paris Match magazine numerous times, and he has routinely been made to defend their relationship in interviews.In one of the more bizarre twists of the election campaign, Macron was forced to deny that he was secretly gay and having an affair. The story originated after a conservative French lawmaker made the allegations in an interview with Russian state-run media.Although Macron had gained exposure through the press and his use of social media, it is the fractured state of French politics that has been key to his rise. While France’s Republican Party has moved to the right in terms of some of its policies, Macron has targeted voters left behind in the shift and sought to appeal to a broad base of political views. In an interview with Britain’s Channel 4 in March, Macron described what he sees as the error of politicians attempting to copy the far-right’s platform in order to undercut its popularity.“When some people decide to go in the Front National’s direction on the political spectrum, that’s a big mistake. That’s a big mistake because they always prefer the original to the copy,” Macron said.This story was originally published on March 22, 2017, and was updated on May 7 following the French presidential election.

Magnitsky’s death sparked international outrage and led to U.S. legislation in 2012 imposing sanctions on several Russian officials. The circumstances surrounding Gorokhov’s injury are not clear. He was in serious but not critical condition as of Thursday, according to investor Bill Browder, a vocal critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin and the man Magnitsky was working for when he was arrested.Browder wrote that Gorokhov was “thrown from the top floor of his apartment building” and is currently hospitalized with severe head injuries in the intensive care unit at Moscow’s Botkin Hospital.Russian news outlets, however, said that Gorokhov was injured while attempting to lift a bathtub up to his apartment with a rope, which reportedly snapped. LifeNews, a tabloid news site seen as loyal to the Kremlin, published several photos of a broken bathtub.Novaya Gazeta, a Russian newspaper critical of Putin, also reported that Gorokhov fell while lifting a bathtub, citing a representative of Hermitage Capital, the investment firm run by Browder. The representative implied that wasn’t the whole story and hinted at foul play. On Wednesday, Gorokhov was supposed to appear in a Moscow appeals court. He was set to challenge a lower court’s refusal to hear a complaint filed by Magnitsky’s mother in relation to the fraud exposed by her son. Gorokhov was also expected to be a witness in a U.S. federal case in Manhattan tied to the alleged fraud. That case was being handled by U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, until he was ousted by President Donald Trump earlier this month.In recent years, several notable Kremlin critics have died or been injured under mysterious circumstances. In February, journalist Vladimir Kara-Murza was hospitalized for organ failure after experiencing symptoms similar to those when he was poisoned in 2015.In 2015, opposition politician Boris Nemstov was shot dead in Moscow. His widow has blamed the Russian government for his death. Later that year, former Russian press minister Mikhail Lesin was found dead in Washington, D.C., after suffering blunt force trauma to the head. Lesin’s death was eventually ruled an accident related to alcohol consumption.Boris Berezovsky, a Russian oligarch who became a Putin critic, was found dead in his home in the U.K. in 2013. And according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 56 members of the press, including investigative reporter Anna Politkovskaya, have been killed in Russia since 1992.Magnitsky’s death prompted the U.S. to take measures in 2012 to punish the Russian officials believed to be responsible for his death. Russia retaliated by imposing sanctions on some U.S. officials and banning adoption of Russian children by Americans. In December last year, Congress voted to expand the law to cover human rights abusers in any country, not just Russia. This article has been updated with information about Gorokhov’s condition. "

In a screenshot of the conversation that made the rounds via Twitter on Sunday, the 44-year-old actress argued against eating the sea creature. “Octopus are too smart to be food,” she wrote. “They have more neurons in their brains than we do. I had to stop eating them because I was so freaked out by it. They can escape from sea world and shit by unscrewing drains and going out to sea.” The conversation later expanded to cover whether squid, a fellow cephalopod, is OK to eat or not, though opinions were more divided on that topic. The incident Paltrow mentions about an octopus escaping to the sea is true, though it didn’t happen at Sea World and it didn’t unscrew a drain. In 2016, an octopus named Inky escaped from his home at the National Aquarium of New Zealand. According to a New York Times article documenting his escape, Inky went through the top of his tank, slithered eight feet across the floor, then made his way down a 164-foot-long pipe to the sea. Many other octopus escapes have been documented over the years, some by unscrewing tanks or wiggling out of tight spaces. “Octopuses are highly evolved and specialized,” Roger Hanlon, a professor at Brown and senior scientist at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, said in a Live Science article. “They have the largest, most complex brain of any invertebrate animals on Earth.”All of this information about octopus intelligence makes eating them a polarizing topic.Some, like Paltrow, argue people shouldn’t consume octopuses because of their genes (they have around 10,000 more than humans) or their neuron count. Though as a report from Scientific American states, octopuses have 500 million neurons, while a human has around 100 billion (so Paltrow was actually incorrect when she said octopuses have more neurons than humans).People eat octopus all around the world. In South Korea, some people eat live octopus as part of a traditional dish. Certain restaurants in the United States ― mostly found in California and New York City ― serve octopus live. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) calls octopuses the “eight-legged Einsteins of the deep” and told The Huffington Post via email why the group doesn’t support eating octopus ― live or dead. “Gwyneth was right, octopuses are highly intelligent and self-aware, and are notorious escape artists,” Ingrid Newkirk, the president of PETA, told HuffPost. “Scientists have verified that octopuses are capable of experiencing pain: Like humans, dogs, and pigs, octopuses have well-developed nervous systems, try to escape painful stimuli, and nurse their wounds.”She added, “Octopus expert Dr. Jennifer Mather has stated that ‘There is absolutely no doubt that they feel pain,’ and explained that an octopus who is being eaten alive is in just as much pain as a pig, fish, or rabbit would be.” We’ll leave the decision whether to eat octopus up to you.

The resolution needs to go back to the Senate because a technical amendment was added, though this shouldn’t stop it from passing, according to the Reno Gazette-Journal. Though the amendment does not need to be approved by Republican Governor Brian Sandoval, he said he was in favor of it passing. “It’s a big day to see this happen. A lot of us have waited a very long time,” Marlene Lockhard, a lobbyist with the Nevada Women’s Lobby, told the Reno Gazette-Journal. Nevada state Sen. Pat Spearman (D) added that she felt triumphant after years of attempting to get the ERA ratified. “We did it. It was overwhelming, but we did it. It shows that it’s never too late to support equality,” she told the Los Angeles Times.Nevada’s ratification is especially significant because it’s the first state to do so since Indiana in 1977.On March 22, 1972, Congress passed the Equal Rights Amendment but not enough states ratified the amendment for it to become part of the Constitution. For an amendment to become part of the Constitution, 38 of the 50 states need to ratify it. Nevada would bring us to 36 states. If two more states were to ratify the ERA at this point, Congress would still need to extend or waive the 1982 deadline it set. “Now it’s a two-state strategy,” Terry O’Neill, the president of the National Organization for Women (NOW), told the LA Times. “It’s very exciting. Over the past five years, Illinois and Virginia have come close. I think there is clear interest in this.”According to Nevada Appeal, Republican Assemblywoman Robin Titus was opposed to the ratification. “I don’t believe my constituents sent me to cast symbolic votes with no chance of success,” she said.Maggie Carlton, a Democratic assemblywoman, had the perfect response to Titus as she argued for the resolution. “I vote for this for today in honor of my mother, my grandmother and my two daughters,” Carlton said, according to the LA Times. “Symbolism or not, it’s time to send the message.” The state Senate is set to vote on the amendment on March 22, the 45th anniversary of the ERA passing in Congress.

Throwing coins on the back of turtles is an old Thai superstition that’s believed to give the person longevity, according to the AP.Vets said they expected her to take about a month to recover from the surgery before undergoing physical therapy. But on Sunday, she was rushed into intensive care when found to be breathing too slowly. During an emergency operation on Monday, she fell into a coma that she didn’t wake up from, Reuters reported.Video and photos posted to a Facebook page belonging to Chansue showed doctors working to save the turtle.“At 10:10 a.m. she went with peace,” Chansue later told reporters, according to Agence France-Presse. “She is my friend, teacher, and patient.”Chansue hopes the turtle’s loss will serve as a wake-up call to end the superstitious practice."
