0,GREEN,Animal Welfare Groups Slam Proposal To Speed Up Poultry Plant Lines,Hilary Hanson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/speed-up-poultry-lines-animal-welfare_us_5a106a1fe4b045cf4371cd9c,The National Chicken Council says speeding up processing won't hurt birds. Others disagree.,2017-11-18,Animal rights and welfare groups say a proposition to speed up chicken processing lines will make slaughterhouses even worse for chickens.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a1074d41500003217858c29.jpeg?cache=5WcPkkiTEl&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Animal welfare advocates are joining worker rights and food safety groups in opposition to a poultry industry proposal to speed up portions of processing lines at chicken plants.The National Chicken Council, an industry trade group, requested in September that the U.S. Department of Agriculture scrap limits on the speed of evisceration lines, where bird organs are removed. The waiver would apply to poultry plants that take part in a new inspection program meant to cut down on food safety risks and also demonstrate they can maintain control at their chosen speed. Right now, most processing line speeds are capped at 140 birds per minute.The ASPCA launched a campaign against the proposal and joined other animal advocacy groups in a letter to the USDA opposing the plan.“Even at current speeds, hundreds of thousands of chickens are boiled alive every year because the workers can’t keep up with the machinery to properly stun or euthanize them,” Deborah Press, director of regulatory affairs and government relations for the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, told HuffPost in an email.Opponents say speeding up the lines will force already-frenzied workers to rush even more, making it harder to handle the birds with care.Rough or careless handling can mean more pain for the birds. It can also mean chickens don’t get shackled properly, which may lead to them being inadequately stunned ― therefore still conscious ― when their throats are slit. Even worse, improper shackling can mean the birds’ throats don’t get properly cut at all, meaning they die by drowning in the hot water-filled scalding tank meant to remove feathers.Tom Super, spokesman for the National Chicken Council, said activists’ concerns are misplaced. A pilot program allowing 20 poultry plants to operate at faster line speeds for 20 years shows they have been “on par or better” in worker safety, food safety and animal welfare, he told HuffPost. He emphasized that speeding up the evisceration lines would have no impact on the speeds of the shackling or slaughter parts of the process.“These criticisms represent a gross misunderstanding of how a poultry plant operates,” Super said.But there’s someone with a very good understanding of how a poultry plant operates who disagrees with Super. Stan Painter is a consumer safety inspector for the USDA who has worked in the meat processing industry in some capacity since the 1980s. He’s also a leader in a union that represents meat inspectors.“What they’re saying is not common sense,” said Painter, noting that he spoke only for himself, not the USDA. If a plant speeds up evisceration lines in order to increase production, the shackling and slaughter processes would also have to go faster in order to supply more birds, he said.Critics of an earlier proposal to speed up evisceration lines made the same argument back in 2013, The Washington Post reported at the time.Anyone who says otherwise, Painter told HuffPost, is “either blowing smoke or he doesn’t know what he’s talking about.”The well-being of chickens is not the only concern for opponents of the industry proposal. Poultry workers hold some of the country’s most dangerous jobs, United Food and Commercial Workers union President Marc Perrone told HuffPost last month. Increasing work speeds, he said, could exacerbate workplace injuries like carpal tunnel.The USDA is accepting public comment on the proposal until Dec. 13."

Weiner at the time reportedly encouraged Gordon to pitch own ideas for the show and offered her a chance to co-write the show’s season finales.Although Gordon won an Emmy in 2009 for working on “Mad Men,” she was fired at the end of the show’s third season, according to Variety.When asked why Gordon came forward with the allegation, Weiner said he did not want to “speak to someone else’s character.”He did, however, say he regretted being a demanding and oftentimes angry boss while working on the AMC drama.“I will say this, that I have hired dozens of women over the years and dozens of people,” he said. “I am a demanding boss and, especially in the early years, it was very hard to do it and a lot of stress. It’s very lonely ― I got better at it for sure.”Weiner then suggested he behaved that way because he wanted the show to be great, saying, “When I think back on it ... letting people go and being mad about having to rewrite everything, you’re just angry a lot of the time, but you want the show to be great and it’s kind of what you do.”He added, “So I guess if I had to do it over again I would do it differently. The person I am now would definitely do it differently.”Marti Noxon, a former senior consultant for “Mad Men,” stood by Gordon’s accusation and, in tweets Friday, described Weiner’s management style as oppressive. “Anyone with an even cursory knowledge of the show Mad Men could imagine that very line coming from the mouth of Pete Campbell,” Noxon said, referencing Weiner’s alleged comment to Gordon.“Matt, Pete’s creator, is many things. He is devilishly clever and witty, but he is also, in the words of one of his colleagues, an ‘emotional terrorist’ who will badger, seduce and even tantrum in an attempt to get his needs met,” Noxon added.Noxon also described the working atmosphere that Weiner created, in which “everyone is constantly off guard and unsure where they stand.”“It is the kind of atmosphere where a comment like ‘you owe it to me to show me your naked body’ may ― or may not ― be a joke. And it may ― or may not ― lead to a demotion or even the end of a career.”Read the rest of Noxon’s tweets below."

It appears on page 50 of the bill, which is headed for a vote sometime after Thanksgiving. The plane thing got a wave of attention Thursday after a tweet about the provision went viral. “If there were any doubt about who this [tax plan] serves, the special tax break for private planes should settle it,” Paul Krugman, the New York Times columnist and liberal economist, wrote on Twitter.Well, yes and no. The measure is certainly a tax break for private plane travel, and the fact that this is part of the Republican tax bill is yet another clear sign of the way the party has used this bill to favor businesses over humans.“It’s an egregious double standard,” said Seth Hanlon, a fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress. Senate Republicans are going out of their way to help out the private aviation industry, as part of a bill that will hurt millions of Americans.But the provision itself isn’t quite as deliciously terrible as the tweets would have you believe.Private plane operators aren’t actually getting any new tax break here. Indeed, the Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan congressional panel that examines tax legislation, says the plane break won’t actually cost anything. The industry and their backers in the Senate, including the super liberal Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), explain that the provision merely brings clarity to a long-standing tax dispute, kicked off five years ago by a memo from the Internal Revenue Service.The provision makes clear that the companies that manage private air travel ― plane owners use them to hire pilots or handle logistics ― do not have to pay a 7.5 percent excise tax on air travel. The 7.5 percent tax is also known as a “ticket tax” and Americans pay it when they travel commercial.This doesn’t mean private air travel isn’t subject to taxes, there’s just a different kind of tax ― a fuel surcharge that amounts to around 20 cents per gallon of gas. Planes burn through 300 gallons an hour.Think of it like how car owners pay gas taxes but if you take a taxi, you pay a different fee, said Nel Stubbs, an aviation tax expert at Conklin & de Decker Aviation Information, an aviation research and consulting company.“I’ve been doing this a long time and it’s not giving owners a tax break, it’s clarifying the application of a tax,” she added.Industry representatives emphasized that the break wasn’t for the millionaires who own the planes, but for the small businesses that they pay to help deal with their travel. At the same time, the private plane tax break is a clear sign of just how in sync Republican lawmakers were with business interests when it came time to write this legislation. The provision is modeled on legislation authored back in February, with the backing of both senators from Ohio, home to NetJets, the private plane company owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.While the tax bill brings certainty to the world of private air travel, the legislation is poised to disrupt millions of regular American households.“They’re settling a long-term dispute between companies and the IRS at literally the same time they changed the bill to make every single tax cut for individuals and families expire after 2025, which creates enormous uncertainty for every household in the United States,” Hanlon said.Hanlon agrees that this measure on its face isn’t terrible, but it is a sign of how the industry is able to get what it wants from policymakers.There has been years of pressure from the private plane industry ― particularly Buffett’s NetJets and Executive Jet Management.“I know our entire industry is grateful to Mr. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway for leading the effort with the IRS to clarify this position,” said Greg Raif, CEO of Private Jet Services, an aviation consultancy and charter plane provider with clients that he says include professional sports teams, presidential candidates and government agencies.Brown’s office made clear that he does not view this as yet another tax giveaway for the rich in a bill already packed full of them.“This provision in no way cuts taxes for private jet owners,” said spokesperson Jennifer Donohue. “It simply clarifies what the law already says — that service companies made up of mechanics and service workers don’t pay ticket taxes, because they don’t sell tickets.”Brown himself got into a shouting match Friday with Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch (Utah) over the tax bill and how it favors the rich.“When the Republicans are in power, the first thing they want to do is give tax cuts to the rich. That’s just what’s ― it’s in their DNA,” Brown said.Up until 2012, plane management companies never had to pay the 7.5 percent excise tax, but that year someone inside the IRS changed the policy. That triggered a lot of tax audits and a lot of lobbying and lawsuits from the industry, which fought hard to avoid this tax.Since the legislation pushed by the Ohio senators never made it to law, the private plane industry saw the tax bill as a good time to push the change through.“We haven’t had a comprehensive tax bill in years and years,” said Stubbs, the aviation tax expert. “This is an opportunity.”Arthur Delaney contributed reporting."

4,WOMEN,"Gabby Douglas Says Dressing Provocatively 'Entices' Wrong Crowd, Sparking Gymnast Feud",Carla Herreria,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gabby-douglas-aly-raisman-modesty-sexual-harassment_us_5a0f7920e4b045cf43717292,"She apologized to fellow Olympian Aly Raisman, but not before defending her tweet.",2017-11-18,"Olympic gymnasts Laurie Hernandez, left, Simone Biles, Aly Raisman, Madison Kocian and Gabby Douglas at the 50th annual CMA Awards in Nashville on Nov. 2, 2016, in Nashville.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0f7d55140000c70250e202.jpeg?cache=TgKXx9wN41&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Two Olympic gymnasts have expressed their disappointment in Gabby Douglas after she suggested that women should dress more conservatively to avoid harassment from others.Douglas made those remarks while responding to fellow Olympian Aly Raisman’s tweet criticizing those who shame victims of sexual assault for the way they dress. “Just because a woman does a sexy photoshoot or wears a sexy outfit does not give a man the right to shame her or not believe her when she comes forward about sexual abuse,” Raisman tweeted Friday morning. “AND when a woman dresses sexy it does not give a man the right to sexually abuse her EVER.”The message echoed one Raisman made earlier this summer when she encouraged her fans to wear whatever made them happy, saying “females do not have to dress modest to be respected.”Douglas replied to Raisman’s note on Friday by saying it is a woman’s “responsibly to dress modestly and be classy.”She added, “Dressing in a provocative/sexual way entices the wrong crowd.”Douglas appears to have deleted her tweet, but not before five-time Olympic medalist Simone Biles read it.Douglas and Raisman were both members of the gold medal-winning 2012 Women’s Olympic Gymnastics Team, know nationally as the Fierce Five. Biles joined both gymnasts in the team competing in the 2016 Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, where the team won the U.S. a consecutive gold medal.After seeing the tweet, Biles rushed to defend Raisman, who this month revealed she had been sexually abused by Larry Nassar, the disgraced USA Gymnastics doctor who has been accused by more than 100 women and girls of abuse over the span of decades.In a tweet containing a screenshot of Douglas’ tweet, Biles said she was shocked but not surprised by Douglas’ response to Raisman’s show of support to victims of sexual abuse.“Honestly, seeing this brings me to tears bc as your teammate I expected more from you & to support” Raisman, Biles said.Douglas defended herself against Twitter users who claimed that the Olympic gymnast’s tweet to Raisman was a form of victim-blaming.“u misunderstood me. not blaming the victim at all. no man should look at any woman that way,” she tweeted to a profile under the Twitter handle @dwtsfishovskiy.When @dwtsfishovskiy suggested that Douglas call on men to respect women, noting that it’s not women’s responsibilities to avoid being assaulted, Douglas replied: “It goes both ways.” Two hours later, Douglas apologized for her deleted reply to Raisman. She insisted that her original message wasn’t expressed correctly and said that abuse “under any circumstance is never acceptable.”She ended her tweet in solidarity with the #metoo movement, a hashtag that has come to symbolize women who have been sexually abused, harassed or assaulted by men.An intense spotlight has recently been cast on abusive men in power ― in Hollywood, the tech industry, politics and elsewhere ― after explosive reports published in October revealed multiple allegations of sexual abuse and manipulation against film mogul Harvey Weinstein.Many other high-profile men have since been accused of sexual misconduct, including director and comedian Louis C.K., Amazon executive Roy Price, Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) and Senate candidate Roy Moore (R-Ala.).However, Nassar, the former doctor to a number of star gymnasts, was first accused of being a serial abuser in 2016, when two gymnasts revealed that Nassar had sexually abused them under the guise of medical care for decades.Some of the abuse allegedly began when the gymnasts were young children and continued into their teens. In addition to Raisman, Olympic gymnast and Fierce Five member McKayla Maroney said last month that Nassar began sexually abusing her when she was 13."

Looking at 2016, the only year for which such data was available, the commission found that, after controlling for criminal history, black men still received 20.4 percent longer sentences than did white men.This report’s findings match those of a previous USSC report from 2007 to 2011, which found a nearly 20 percent gap in sentences between black and white men. The racial disparities in sentencing appear to have increased over the last two decades, worsening specifically after 2005.According to older USSC reports, the gap between black and white men in sentencing was about 11 percent for 1998 to 2003 and 5 percent for 2003 to 2005. But it jumped to 15 percent for 2005 to 2007 and to nearly 20 percent thereafter.USSC noted in a 2010 report that the differences in sentence length between black and white male offenders “have increased steadily” since the Supreme Court ruled in 2005 in United States v. Booker to increase judges’ discretion in sentencing. But the factors contributing to racial disparities in sentencing are complex, according to Marc Mauer, director of the nonprofit Sentencing Project. Judges aren’t the only factor, or necessarily even the biggest, in sentencing disparities.“It’s not necessarily racist judges,” Mauer told HuffPost by email Friday. “But much of [the] disparity [is] likely due to decision-making by prosecutors.”Mauer pointed to research from scholars Sonja Starr and Marit Rehavi, which found that prosecutors “have a huge impact on sentences,” as they have broad discretion in how to charge an offender or whether to offer a plea-bargain. Overall, sentencing is just one part of the broader problem of racial discrimination in the criminal justice system: Black people are incarcerated in U.S. state prisons at more than five times the rate of white people."

Since May, Mueller, a former FBI director, has been leading an investigation into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. Trump has repeatedly denied that his team colluded with Russia to win the election.In late October, a federal grand jury filed the first charges in Mueller’s investigation.

The subtlety of its signs are often overshadowed by our daily routines. It’s not that we don’t notice our children daily—we do. We learn an incredible amount of completely random things through our daily interactions (for example, red food coloring has historically been derived from ground-up cockroaches). However, it isn’t until the weather gets colder and flip-flops take a backseat to sneakers that we realize the same children we lay eyes on daily have somehow outgrown every pair of closed-toed shoes they own! Other times, change is abrupt and the universe undergoes a massive shift, overnight. We wake up on the First of November and after reasoning with our children about why Halloween candy isn’t on the menu for breakfast (okay-maybe just one piece), we realize that just as quickly as we’ve flipped the page on the calendar, we’ve welcomed in an entire season of change. The arrival of November represents the beginning of the season of being thankful. Once the clock strikes midnight and Halloween is but a memory, everyone seems eager to share with the world all of the reasons for which they give thanks. Social media becomes a literal sounding board for this very purpose. Unlike other trends, this is one I can (and do) get excited about. I love the positivity of it all, mostly because it opens the door to self-reflection in a very refreshing way. Too often, we lose sight of the fact that social media is, in essence, nothing more than a highlight reel that invites us to compare our lives to others’. The sudden shift in perspective that November seems to bring is a welcome one. Taking the time to find something to be grateful for in every day is good for the soul. The time I’ve spent reflecting this month has taught me more about myself and my values than in any years, past. The things that I am thankful for this season come from a much deeper, infinitely more personal space in my heart. First, I am thankful for the small group of family members and friends who cared enough about my daughter, Piper, to say the words that hurt to hear instead of the words I wished to hear. The best of grandmothers thinks all her grandchildren are the closest thing in life to perfection, so I know how much it must have hurt you to have to stand up and point out to your son and daughter-in-law that your granddaughter desperately needed help. As a parent, the pain that comes with realizing that your child has real challenges is visceral. You feel helpless, yet you temporarily live in a phase of grief and denial. In that phase, you feel frozen and unable to act. It often takes a full blown “Come to Jesus” meeting, not a gentle nudge, as a call to action. I am thankful for you beyond words, because you didn’t allow me to unpack and set up residence on denial island. I am thankful for the growing bond between all three of my children. When you have multiple children and one of them is diagnosed with autism, you get so caught up in the whirlwind of social evaluations and therapies, it’s easy to forget for a while that the most fundamental social interactions your child can establish happen right in your home, with their siblings. As soon as Piper gained the ability to communicate, I saw these beautiful social relationships begin to flourish. I never knew seeing three children dismantle a living room to build a fort together could be so beautiful. I am so thankful for the significance of the underlying beauty in all of that chaos. I am thankful that my oldest daughter has regained her confidence and sense of self. The preteen years are never easy to navigate, emotionally, but I would be remiss to deny that the unsteady path our lives took us on for a while contributed to some of her angst and self-doubt. I know it worried her deeply to see her little sister struggle. I am thankful to catch a glimpse of her smiling as she daydreams instead of finding her up in the middle of the night riddled with worry. I’m thankful for the re-emergence of her spirit and for everything about who she is. I am thankful for the compassionate heart of my son. At the beginning of the year, I tasked him with walking Piper to her classroom each day to ensure her safe arrival. Months later, she knows exactly where to go on her own. I didn’t realize he was still walking her in until she was home sick last week, and her teacher told me that he reported in to her classroom as usual just to announce she’d be absent. Just last night, he asked to come with me to watch her ballet class. As she danced, he touched my arm, never taking his eyes off of her and said “Mom, she’s doing great! Tonight, she’s the same as every other girl in that room.” I don’t know that he will ever realize how profound a statement that was. I am thankful every day that he is so aware of her needs and her feelings.I am thankful for early intervention and the team of individuals who have given of themselves (and continue to do so) throughout Piper’s journey. I’d like to look at this beyond the traditional facts about intervention at a young age and quality of life. On a personal level, I am thankful because the results of this immense, collaborative effort have given me gift of quality time with my children. For so long, I dreaded trips to the grocery store. I ventured out alone. Those trips were so lonely for me. They were honestly hard to get through for a while. I’d see mothers with children Piper’s age chatting happily through the aisles, and I didn’t feel like we’d ever get to that point. She would get so overwhelmed, I would never bring her with me. It felt like I was punishing her. My older children stopped asking to go, probably because I was so stressed and not a lot of fun to be around. I’d be gone twice as long as I should have been, because it took me that long just to motivate myself to get from the car into the store. Now, I have company just about every time I go anywhere. I’m sure that at some point, like any mom, I’ll long for a trip to the store by myself, but not right now. Right now, I’m just thankful for the opportunity to share the experience with children who enjoy being with me, and with each other.There are so many things for which I am thankful—I haven’t even scratched the surface. It’s been amazing to realize that the things I’m most thankful for aren’t “things” at all. Maybe I’m just growing up, but I think it has more to do with the perspective I’ve gained through learning the ins and outs of raising a child with autism.No matter what the reason, it’s always a good time to be thankful. Despite what you see on the surface, no one has an easy journey through life. It’s easy to get down, and even easier to stay down. That’s why it’s so important to reflect on all of those tough days that you’ve survived, and to be thankful for all the ways you’ve grown. I encourage any of you, regardless of your personal situation, to take the time to read those “Why I Am Thankful” posts on your newsfeed instead of scrolling past them. It is true that on most days, maintaining a positive attitude is a choice we make, but it’s also true that positivity and a grateful spirit can be contagious!"

Climate change is “one of the most worrying phenomena our humanity is experiencing,” the pontiff wrote Thursday in a letter sent to world leaders gathered for the United Nations’ annual climate change conference. He also warned participants against falling prey to certain “perverse” attitudes on the issue, including denial, indifference and resignation.Such attitudes “certainly do not help honest research or sincere and productive dialogue on building the future of our planet,” Francis wrote, according to a translation provided by Vatican Radio. “We need an exchange that unites us all, because the environmental challenge we are experiencing, and its human roots, regards us all, and affects us all.”The purpose of this year’s meeting, officially called the 23rd Conference of the Parties, is to hammer out how countries will implement the Paris climate accord. The landmark pact, which nearly 200 countries signed in 2015, aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions around the world. Francis didn’t berate any particular nation. But there’s only one country in the world that has remained opposed to the global agreement: the United States. President Donald Trump promised in June that he would withdraw the U.S. from the pact, claiming it would damage the American economy. The U.S. is one of the world’s top emitters of greenhouse gases.The Trump administration has also proposed rolling back the Clean Power Plan, an Obama-era federal regulation aimed at limiting greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. The president has instead promised to revive America’s coal industry and increase oil and gas production. Trump has long been a climate change skeptic, previously describing the phenomenon as “bullshit” and a hoax “created by and for the Chinese.”Francis, on the other hand, is a staunch advocate for action on the environment. In a 2015 encyclical called “Laudato Si,” he made it clear that he believes humans are partly to blame for the troubles the Earth is facing. He laid out a moral and theological case for addressing climate change and urged Catholics and others around the world to make the issue a top priority.When Francis met Trump at the Vatican earlier this year, the pontiff sent the president off with some heavy reading ― a copy of “Laudato Si” was among the many gifts Francis gave Trump.Judging by the administration’s decision to defend fossil fuels at the COP23 conference, there’s a chance Trump may not have gleaned much from his homework."

12,ENTERTAINMENT,"'I'm Disappointed In My Friend,' Comedian Marc Maron Says Of Louis C.K.",Carla Herreria,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/marc-maron-louis-ck-scandal_us_5a0e0123e4b0e97dffec4495,"The “WTF” podcast host also calls out his own ""toxic male presence"" and the comedy business for enabling abuses.",2017-11-17,Rumors about Louis C.K.'s behavior had been swirling in comedy circles.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0e15021800003300f6c9a3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Comedian and actor Marc Maron addressed the sexual misconduct scandal surrounding his friend and colleague Louis C.K. during an episode of Maron’s acclaimed podcast, “WTF.”During one of his trademark self-reflective monologues Monday, Maron, 54, said he was disgusted by Louis C.K.’s admission that he had masturbated in front of several female comedians who had sought his professional guidance, but Maron maintained that he would remain Louis C.K.’s friend.The podcast host spoke critically of the comedy industry, including his own complicit behavior, and blamed the environment comedy creates for enabling this type of abuse.“Louis copped to it, and copped to it late, but he did it,” Maron said Monday. “And he’s my friend, and it’s a difficult position to be in because I certainly can’t condone anything he did. There was no way to justify it, no way to defend it, no way to apologize for him about it, no way to let him off the hook.”The “WTF” host first responded to the accusations last week after a New York Times report detailed five women’s accounts of Louis C.K.’s unwanted sexual advances. In some of the cases, most of which involved rising female comedians, Louis C.K. would masturbate in front of the women or while he was speaking with them over the phone.A day after the Times article ran, Louis C.K. admitted that the accusations were true and said he regretted abusing his power in the industry to take advantage of his colleagues.Maron said he had heard of the accusations years earlier but never knew the names of the women involved. When he confronted Louis C.K. with the stories, Maron said that he dismissed them as “not true” and mere “rumors.”“The real problem is that female comics have been hearing about this stuff for a while, and there was no place where they could go with that information,” Maron said. “There was no place for them to go with these stories where they felt safe to tell them ― and it’s fucking sad.”Maron acknowledged that he and many other men don’t realize “all of the male bullshit that every woman has to deal with in every work environment” but added that “there is just no HR department in comedy.”The comedian also called out the industry for pressuring others to stay quiet about abuse within the community.“If you have a male club owner and you have a dude that they’re trying to make into a big comic and he ... does something or assaults somebody, it’s always brushed under the rug,” he said.″‘Hey man, don’t make trouble, don’t embarrass everybody. Don’t embarrass yourself,’” Maron said mockingly. “That is the way it is. and that is not correct.”Maron did not let himself off the hook for the environment comedy creates for women either.The podcast host admitted to being a “toxic male presence” himself by not hiring women for his TV show on the IFC network, “Maron,” which aired for four seasons, and by dating ― and marrying ― women who were his fans.In the past, Maron said, he’s acted emotionally abusive, insensitive, angry and without empathy for women. The comedian has discussed many of these personal struggles in his podcast over the years. While trying to access his own empathy for women who have been abused by men in power, Maron revealed that he had once been forcefully kissed by a philosophy professor when he was a student in college. The incident put Maron “into a paralysis” that he couldn’t do anything about.“I felt bad, and I carried that confusion and that shame with me for a while,” Maron said, later adding, “I was young and impressionable, and a guy I respected and looked up to did that ... and it was awful.”In light of all the men in power who are facing accusations of abuse, Maron said: “This is obviously a fucking massive, turbulent learning moment for men, if you choose to take the education.”Maron said that it’s important for everyone to listen the victims’ voices now so that they can feel like they are being heard.And despite his disgust for Louis C.K.’s behavior ― and without apologizing for it either ― Maron said he would remain the director and comedian’s friend to help him change. Appearing to hold back tears, Maron concluded:“I’m disappointed in my friend. He did some gross shit, some damaging shit. People are like, ‘How are you going to be friends with that guy?’ He’s my friend. He fucked up. And you know, he’s in big fucking trouble.Listen to Marc Maron’s full podcast episode here."

Jamie Johnson expressed while he was host of a radio program in Iowa and as a guest on other conservative shows. He made the comments about blacks and slums in 2008 on “The Right Balance” on Accent Radio Network, CNN reported.Johnson also said during his radio appearances from 2008 to 2016 that Islam’s only contribution to the world was oil and “dead bodies,” and that terrorism represented the “true meaning” of Islam. “Jews do not want to cut our heads off; Muslims want to cut our heads off,” he said in 2011. The Department of Homeland Security announced Johnson’s resignation within hours after the CNN story appeared Thursday.Johnson was appointed head of the Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships at DHS in April by then-Secretary John Kelly. The center is part of a network including the White House and Federal Emergency Management Agency.Ironically, Johnson was tasked with engaging a “broader cross-section of faith and community-based organizations” in helping to respond more effectively to disasters such as hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma, according to the department’s website. The center is also supposed to help combat human trafficking and the “exploitation of the poor and vulnerable.”Following the CNN story, Johnson told the network that “unequivocally” his past statements “do not represent my views personally or professionally.” He apologized for the “manner in which those thoughts were expressed in the past.”He added: “Having witnessed leaders from the entire faith spectrum work to empower their communities, I now see things much differently.”The FEMA website boasted of Johnson’s background in ministry, broadcasting, teaching, consulting, organizational leadership [and] international humanitarian relief.” He worked for several years on GOP political races and issues in Iowa, including on the campaigns of Rick Santorum and Donald Trump, The Washington Post noted.Before DHS announced he was stepping down, agency spokesman Tyler Houlton said that some of the comments were made “nearly a decade ago,” and that Johnson had apologized for them. Houlton also said that Johnson has “proven himself as a valuable supporter and proponent of the interfaith community’s recovery efforts” after the recent hurricanes.A DHS statement later announcing Johnson’s resignation said that “his comments made prior to joining the Department of Homeland Security clearly do not reflect the values of DHS and the administration.”"

The Uber driver, referred to as “Kate” throughout the BuzzFeed article, said she had been working as a driver for two years when she picked up Winston in downtown Scottsdale, Arizona, around 2 a.m. on March 13, 2016. According to Kate, Winston was the only passenger and his friends put him in the front seat of her car. Winston immediately began behaving inappropriately and shouting homophobic slurs at people on the sidewalk, Kate told BuzzFeed. Winston then asked to stop to get food. While waiting in a drive-thru line, Kate said Winston “reached over and he just grabbed [her] crotch.” She said he held his hand there for three to five seconds until she looked at him and said, “What’s up with that?”“I wasn’t just creeped out. I was frozen,” Kate said. “I mean he’s an NFL quarterback and I’m 5-foot-6. I’m not prepared for that. So I completely froze.” Kate, who no longer works for Uber, filed a complaint with the company right after the incident happened. Uber responded to the allegations in a statement to BuzzFeed: “The behavior the driver reported is disturbing and wrong. The rider was permanently removed from the app shortly after we learned of the incident.” (The account holder who ordered the Uber has been removed from the ride-sharing service, but it’s not clear if that account is Winston’s.) Winston tweeted a statement on Friday afternoon responding to the groping allegations, calling them “false.”“I believe the driver was confused as to the number of passengers in the car and who was sitting next to her,” the statement read. “The accusation is false, and given the nature of the allegation and increased awareness and consideration of these types of matters, I am addressing this false report immediately. At the time of the alleged incident, I denied the allegations to Uber, yet they still decided to suspend my account.” “I am supportive of the national movement to raise awareness and develop better responses to the concerns of parties who find themselves in these types of situations, but this accusation is false,” it continued. “While I am certain that I did not make any inappropriate contact, I don’t want to engage in a battle with the driver and I regret if my demeanor or presence made her uncomfortable in any way.”According to a letter obtained by BuzzFeed that was sent to Kate from Lisa Friel, the NFL’s special counsel for investigations, the NFL is looking into the accusations. Winston has been in the headlines for allegations of sexual misconduct before. Winston was accused of raping a fellow student in 2012 while attending and playing football at Florida State University. In a 2015 civil complaint, the woman sued Winston for “sexual battery, assault, false imprisonment, and intentional infliction of emotional distress arising out of forcible rape.” Winston denied the allegations, claiming the two had consensual sex. Although Winston was never formally charged for the alleged rape, FSU paid the woman $950,000 in January 2016 as a settlement for a lawsuit she filed against the university that said the school had mishandled her case. Kate told BuzzFeed that she came forward with her story to ensure what she says happened to her doesn’t happen to other women. “I have been empowered by my sisters who have forged this path by speaking up, and I must do my part to make it a little more well traveled,” she said. “If I’m silent, I fear that further harm will come to other women, if it hasn’t already. He sexually assaulted me, and I have every right to tell the damn truth about it.” "

She jokingly called for a “thank you” from President Donald Trump, now that national media is focused on her family instead of the White House.“I personally think he owes us a thank you,” she said with a smile. “Haven’t you noticed we aren’t hearing that much about Russia?”But beyond acknowledging that they themselves hadn’t been touched inappropriately by Moore, the women’s messages often went in unexpected directions.

Why didn’t the mother say anything about it?” Shiber said to HuffPost. “Roy has a beautiful wife! Why would he want to fool with some ugly-looking woman? She needs a sign over her head asking to pay for somebody to be with her.”Asked to elaborate on why the accusers’ keeping quiet for several decades is evidence that they are lying, she said: “The more you stir shit, the more it stinks.”Even if the allegations turned out to be true, some voters wouldn’t be swayed. Montgomery native Tim Hensley, 58, was seen arguing with a protester just outside the event. The protester held a sign that read “Roy Moore is a pedophile.” Hensley told HuffPost that he’d forgive Moore for sexual assault.“Nothing’s really gonna change my mind,” he said. “This was 40 years ago. I probably did some things I wasn’t proud of then. I’d forgive him unless we found out about something, say, five years ago.” The special election between Moore and Jones is scheduled for Dec. 12. Many in the national GOP have called for Moore to step down, but he has repeatedly said he’ll continue his race."

I probably did some things I wasn’t proud of then. I’d forgive him unless we found out about something, say, five years ago.” The special election between Moore and Jones is scheduled for Dec. 12. Many in the national GOP have called for Moore to step down, but he has repeatedly said he’ll continue his race."

The controversial march has become a magnet for far-right, anti-Semitic and white supremacist groups.In a Facebook post, Lazarek said she heard the Catholic priest at the service “warmly” welcome and bless nationalist groups.

Leaders from Poland’s ruling Law and Justice Party, a right-wing nationalist party, condemned anti-Semitic and racist banners, but not the march itself.Poland’s Catholic bishops have also condemned nationalism, racism and xenophobia. Archbishop Józef Kupny of Wrocław told reporters earlier this year that the church believes there is a “clear distinction between noble patriotism and nationalism, which is a form of social egoism.”Roman Kneblewski, the priest who was celebrating the Mass at the service Lazarek attended, is known for his nationalist views, according to Paulina Napierała, an assistant professor in Kraków at Jagiellonian University’s Institute of American Studies and Polish Diaspora.Other Polish Catholic priests have also expressed support for nationalists, Napierała said. A prime example is Jacek Miedlar, a far-right preacher from Wrocław whose sermons target Muslims and immigration.

19,POLITICS,Republican Tax Scam: Make America Grieve Again,"Leo W. Gerard , ContributorInternational President United Steelworkers union",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republican-tax-scam-make-america-grieve-again_us_5a0f11ece4b023121e0e921c,We've been down this road before.,2017-11-17,<p>The GOP tax scam will cause more U.S. factory closures like this one in Western Pennsylvania. </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0f13a8140000240050e0bd.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A giant sucking sound, louder than a freight train, noisier than a tornado, shriller than Ross Perot yelling, “I told you so,” blasted across the nation yesterday as Republicans in the U.S. House passed their tax plan. It was the terrible sound of jobs swept out of this country. When Perot ran for president, he said the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) would siphon off American jobs. And he was right. It did. But this is much, much bigger. House Republicans approved a scam exempting corporations from all taxes on their foreign operations. Under the GOP proposal, corporations like Carrier and Rexnord can benefit from protections provided by American patents, courts and armed forces, while moving their factories from the United States to Mexico. Or to other low-wage, high-polluting countries like China. Or to countries that charge little or no corporate tax. Once there, instead of paying the new, super-low 20 percent corporate rate Republicans propose for U.S-based producers, the expat factories will pay no taxes to the United States. Nothing. Not a cent.Rather than Making America Great Again, Congressional Republicans plan to Make America Grieve Again as even more family-supporting factory jobs get shipped offshore to take advantage of the new tax rate of zip. The math behind that job transfer is simple. Continue manufacturing in the United States and pay a corporate income tax dramatically lowered from 35 to 20 percent. Or move to a ridiculously low-tax country like Switzerland, Montenegro or Paraguay, and pay a measly 9 percent to that nation and nothing to the United States.With the proposed corporate tax gift from Republicans, CEOs could uproot factories in places like Illinois, Indiana and Western Pennsylvania and ship them to brand new facilities in Bermuda, Palau or Turks & Caicos, where the corporate tax rate is zero. The corporation would pay no taxes on profits to the country hosting the factory and nothing to the United States, which hosts the headquarters.Republicans contend such corporations will bring those foreign profits back to the United States and invest here. Why would CEOs do that when any American plant they invest in would be billed taxes on profits while the same factory located in certain other countries would pay nothing?Why would they do that when they didn’t before?Right now, corporations are sitting on $2.6 trillion in overseas profits. They have not invested that money in U.S. research, factories or jobs because they don’t want to pay the current 35 percent tax rate that would be charged when those profits are returned to the country.To lure that money back, Republicans propose to give corporations a tax holiday, cutting the rate to between 5 and 12 percent for repatriating the $2.6 billion. The GOP insists corporations will take advantage of that tax deal to bring those billions home and invest in American production. But they won’t. The proof is that they didn’t last time.Congress gave corporations a tax holiday in 2004 during which CEOs could return foreign profits to the United States and pay a mere 5 percent tax on them in exchange for investment in U.S. research, factories and jobs.CEOs brought back the money and grabbed that 5 percent rate, alright. But they didn’t use the repatriated cash to conduct research, build factories or create jobs. Just the opposite.A study by the Democratic staff of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations found that the 15 corporations that benefited most from the tax holiday turned around and cut more than 20,000 jobs and diminished their pace of research spending.Labeling the 2004 tax holiday a failed policy, the report cautions against repeating it, saying it cost the U.S. Treasury $3.3 billion in lost revenues over 10 years and led to U.S. corporations sending more funds offshore.“There is no evidence that the previous repatriation tax giveaway put Americans to work, and substantial evidence that it instead grew executive paychecks, propped up stock prices, and drew more money and jobs offshore,” said former Michigan Senator Carl Levin, then-chairman of the subcommittee, when the report was released in 2011.So the contention that corporations now would invest in U.S. research, factories and jobs because Republicans plan to give them another tax holiday is about as solid as smoke ― the stuff emitted from American factories pre-NAFTA and now flowing from mills moved to Mexico. The same goes for the contention that corporations will invest in U.S. research, factories and jobs with completely untaxed foreign profits.In fact, suspending taxes on foreign profits would create a perverse incentive for corporations to make it overseas instead of making it in America. But Republicans intend to do it anyway.Republicans say they must cater to the tax demands of corporations because other countries – Germany and Ireland, for example – offer corporations low rates. And those same Republicans contend they must cease charging American corporations taxes on their foreign operations because other countries have stopped.That describes a race to the bottom. Pretty soon, corporations won’t pay any taxes at all, anywhere to anyone. They’ll provide nothing toward the roads they use to transport their products, the school systems that educate their workers, the Army Corps of Engineers that protects factories from floods.If countries don’t work together to stop corporations from playing one against the other, workers will get stuck with all of the costs. That’s what’s happening under the GOP tax scam. The tax changes were supposed to benefit middle-class workers. But they do not.An analysis of the Senate tax plan, released this week by the Joint Committee on Taxation, which is the official nonpartisan review agency serving Congress, showed the scam would give large tax cuts to corporations and millionaires while raising the levies charged to families earning $10,000 to $75,000 – that’s low-income and middle-class families.White House National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn said this week, “The most excited group out there are big CEOs, about our tax plan.” Of course they are. Those 1 percenters and their corporations get all the breaks.To help pay for big fat tax cuts for millionaires and zeroed-out taxes for corporations, Republicans plan to slash programs crucial to workers – like Medicare and Medicaid – and vital deductions, like those for property taxes and student loan interest.Just like NAFTA, this GOP tax scheme is a scam, a bait-and-switch ruse. Workers pay more and get less – fewer government services and far fewer job opportunities. This time, their jobs won’t just be going south of the border. They’ll be shipped anyplace in the world touting the lowest tax rates."

Lawyer.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/native-american-child-gunned-down-by-ashland-county_us_5a0e29dfe4b0e30a9585057c,"Unfortunately, many times when brown-skinned people call 911 for help, they get killed instead.",2017-11-17,<p>14 Year Old Jason Pero was violently gunned down by Ashland County Sheriff’s Deputy Brock Mrdjenovich</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0e2a3d1500002a00858839.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"People call 911 because they expect help, because they want prevent someone from getting hurt. People do not call 911 because they want to be hurt or because they want to hurt somebody else.Unfortunately, many times when brown-skinned people call 911 for help, they get killed instead.A 14-year-old child named Jason Pero called 911 and an Ashland County Sheriff deputy by the name of Deputy Brock Mrdjenovich responded to his 911 call. Jason was home from school and he had a knife in his hand. Interestingly, Wisconsin has some of the more liberal knife laws in the land, but more on that later. Deputy Brock Mrdjenovich—the man who killed the young child—said that the child “lunged” at him. Implicit in the officer’s statement is the notion that he had no other option but to fatally shoot a young boy with a knife—he could not detain him, taze him, shoot him in the hand that held the knife, etc.Even assuming that Jason indeed lunged at him, that should not necessitate lethal force. As American Civil Liberties Union attorney Claudia Center said, “You should not be assuming that just because a knife is in the picture that lethal force is automatically required or appropriate.”But Mrdjenovich assumed that lethal force was required against this child.I do not mean to make this tragedy about anything other than the child. Still, it is important to acknowledge Brock and the Ashland County Sheriff’s Department’s place on the wrong side of history. In the middle of the day on a Wednesday, Deputy Brock Mrdjenovich decided to end a Native American child’s life with a firearm. This, of course, is a common storyline as state-sponsored violence kills Native Americans at incredibly disproportionate rates. It also follows a common narrative as law enforcement—when they kill people—quickly move to shift blame from themselves to the victims of the killing. Tragically, 8th Grader Jason Pero, a member of the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, is the latest victim of these horrible trends.The child was on his own homelands when Mrdjenovich shot Pero down. He was home sick from school. He was emotional and vulnerable—as children can be from time to time. Teenage hormones and puberty are both helluva drugs. Young Jason called 911 about 11:40 a.m. where the Ashland County Sheriff is charged with protecting and serving the Bad River community alongside tribal law enforcement. There is no independent corroboration of a “lunge” or an altercation or anything other than that there was a child’s body lying there.And the child was treated at the scene but died at a hospital.Of course the authorities were quick to distance their own liability and released information implicating the child. The Wisconsin Justice Department released the information that a knife was recovered at the scene of the shooting. Subsequently, law enforcement began to question Pero’s family about whether he had a knife or not.Interestingly, whether or not this boy had a knife has almost zero legal consequence. Pretty much every type of knife is legal in Wisconsin, including pocket knives, KA-BAR knives, Bowie knives, hunting and fishing knives, machetes, swords, throwing stars, throwing knives, daggers, stilettos, etc. Even sword-canes and disguised knives such as belt-buckle blades are fair game in Wisconsin.In short, there is no reason that this young Native child is dead as there are many non-lethal means to disarm armed people. There are even more non-lethal means when that “armed person” is a 14-year-old child carrying a knife who called 911 himself. I do not know the officer so I cannot suggest racism, although institutional racism against Native people is a rampant issue in Wisconsin. That racism is reflected by the epidemic of Native children who are suspended and expelled from schools, disproportionate rates of incarceration and different sentencing for the same crimes, and obviously also by law enforcement killing Natives at higher rates than anyone else in the nation. I will say that the fact that Native people are killed so frequently by law enforcement at least shows a wanton recklessness and lack of respect for Native lives.May the Creator comfort the family of Jason Pero. May that comfort by finding justice and prosecuting, to the greatest degree allowed by the law, the violent killer who took this child away from his family.#JusticeForJasonPlease donate to the family at https://www.gofundme.com/ebe78-justice-for-baby-jayGyasi Ross is a father, an author and a storyteller.

Conway then added that she should be credited for breaking open the conversation around sexual harassment. She said that she tried to make this topic an issue last October, a day after the “Access Hollywood” tape leaked showing Trump bragging about being able to grab women “by the pussy” with impunity. “I would like to say that I was the first person in the administration last Thursday when this news broke, I happened to be interviewed on a different network at the time, to come out against conduct as it was described, and I went a step further,” she said. “I tried to make this an issue over a year ago on Oct. 9, 2016, when I talked about maybe when I was younger and prettier, folks on Capitol Hill behaving in such a way that we should take a look at fresh.”“And I’m so glad that women on the left, particularly on Capitol Hill, are now coming forward and want to have hearings and are swearing under oath and getting people to come forward,” she continued. “That’s great. I tried to do it 13 months ago; nobody wanted to listen to me because of the campaign I was managing. This is an important topic but in terms of this particular issue and this particular Senate race, I will not get ahead of the president and anything he wishes to add.”Skip ahead to minute 4:30 to hear Conway discuss Moore. At least 16 women have accused Trump of sexual assault dating back to the 1980s. During a talk at the University of Virginia last November, an audience member asked Conway how she rationalized being Trump’s campaign manager in the wake of the assault allegations. “For you to use sexual assault to try to make news here I think is unfortunate,” Conway responded.

Since 1983, every NCAA women’s basketball championship team has been invited to the White House.Head coach Dawn Staley told The Associated Press in September that the team had yet to receive an invitation to the White House reception. “We haven’t gotten an invitation yet, and that in itself speaks volumes,” Staley said. “We won before those other teams won their championships. I don’t know what else has to happen.”Staley told ESPN on Thursday that the team did finally receive an invitation to Friday’s event, but now they have bigger fish to fry. “We did hear from the White House about attending tomorrow’s event, but we will not be able to attend,” she said. “As I’ve been saying since our practices for this season started, all of our focus is on the season ahead.

Elanor willingly divulges details of her previous relationships, but Max has been less forthcoming. After confiding in his quirky neighbor, Lewis (Paul Molnar), Max must work up the courage to explain to Elanor that he has dated both women and men. Written by Colleen Crabtree and Dan Rothenberg and directed by Jonathan Silverstein, “Hot Mess” is essentially “a romantic comedy with a little twist,” Crumm told HuffPost. The 32-year-old actor, who is best known to New York audiences for his stints in “Disaster!” and “Grease” on Broadway, said the play offered him a chance to not only tackle a non-musical role, but also inhabit a queer character for the first time. (Catch a sneak peek at the show in the trailer above.)“I like things that push the envelope and start conversations that aren’t necessarily at the forefront of social consciousness,” said Crumm, who came out as gay when he was 22.Portraying a bisexual character as opposed to a gay one, he added, was also appealing.“I think both straight and gay people find it hard to understand and relate to bisexual people, because it’s easier to believe that they haven’t made up their mind,” he said. “I think it’s easier for society to put people into boxes.”Crumm was born in Los Angeles but spent his formative years in Phoenix, Arizona, and struggled to come to terms with his sexuality while growing up in the Southern Baptist church. “I thought I’d be in the closet my entire life,” he said. “I didn’t think I would ever live a comfortable, open life.”His decision to pursue a career in show business presented new challenges. “I was nervous [my sexuality] would take attention away from the shows I was doing at the time or become an issue, especially when I was still figuring it out myself,” he said. Although he has since found success in theater and film, Crumm said he still feels “like an outsider” in the queer community ― yet another reason he wanted to tackle “Hot Mess.” “I feel like I’ve never really been fit enough for some people. I haven’t been masculine enough, I haven’t been feminine enough,” he said. He described himself as a “regular dude,” adding, “I would love to [be a role model] for young gay kids who are like me, and want to see a reflection of themselves in society.”Looking forward, Crumm said he hopes to explore other aspects of queer life onstage.“I want to play another man’s love interest,” he said, citing Broadway actors Ben Platt, Gavin Creel and Taylor Trensch as his dream co-stars. “I’d love to kiss a boy onstage. It’d be nice!”Ultimately, he said he hopes the “hijinks” presented in “Hot Mess” will resonate among those who have had to navigate challenges in relationships, even if they don’t identify as LGBTQ.“I hope they learn a little bit about themselves, and a little bit about acceptance,” he said. “And that they’ve laughed their asses off!”Catch the latest in LGBTQ entertainment by subscribing to the Queer Voices newsletter.

25,POLITICS,A Provision Buried In The House Tax Bill Could Slow Affordable Housing Construction,Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tax-bil-affordable-housing_us_5a0f1b9be4b045cf43711d3d,Republicans are rushing to pass a tax bill that could have all kinds of side effects.,2017-11-17,"Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, along with his leadership, celebrate passing the House tax bill. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0f1cd41800003300f6cba2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― A little-noticed provision in the Republican tax reform bill that passed the House on Thursday could have a big impact on affordable housing construction.The House bill maintains a tax subsidy for low-income housing construction, but ends the tax-free status of certain bonds that builders rely on to arrange financing.Developers say the mere threat of the policy change already has them scrambling to close deals for upcoming projects before the end of the year, when funding could disappear.Chris Akbari, president the Itex Group, a development company in Texas, said his firm is in the process of closing a $49 million deal to buy and rehabilitate a low-income apartment complex in Houston.“We might not be able to close in time,” Akbari said. The tax subsidy is one of several seemingly random items targeted in the House tax plan, such as deductions for medical expenses, student loan interest and certain moving expenses, that Republicans included less out of ideology than a desire to simplify the tax code ― and a need for money.The House bill cuts $3 trillion in taxes on businesses and individuals, and replaces half of that lost revenue through the elimination of various deductions. Among the items on the chopping block are $38 billion in what are known as “private activity bonds,” or tax-free local government loans for private enterprises that serve the public interest, like airports, waste disposal facilities and affordable housing.“We have a lot of items that were put in our current tax code in order to incentivize people to do certain things,” Rep. Mike Kelly (R-Pa.), a member of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, told HuffPost. “And now, in order to get the rates lower, we’re looking at those again and saying, ‘Well, maybe we’re going have to do away with some of these.’”The Senate tax bill doesn’t have the same provision, which is one of the smaller differences between the two bills. Ultimately, if tax reform is going to reach the president’s desk, the House and Senate will have to agree on one bill, most likely a compromise version hammered out in a conference committee with lawmakers from each chamber.“We’re gonna go to conference and we’ll see what comes out of there,” Kelly said.The House tax bill nominally preserves the Low Income Housing Tax Credit, a $9 billion subsidy for the rehabilitation and construction of affordable housing. Some of the credits are paired with tax-free government bonds and issued by states to developers, which can then sell the tax credits to investors in order to obtain additional financing for qualified projects. However, without the bonds, which the House bill would kill, the credit would be useless for some projects.“This will have a severe impact on the construction and preservation of affordable homes throughout the country,” Diane Yentel, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, said in a statement earlier this month. Novagradac, an accounting and consulting firm that specializes in real estate, estimated that the bill would result in about 80,000 fewer new and rehabilitated affordable housing units per year.The housing credit has plenty of critics. The libertarian Cato Institute argues the subsidy mainly benefits developers and investors. “The program has complex administration, is prone to abuse, and produces costly low-income housing,” Cato’s Chris Edwards and Vanessa Brown Calder wrote earlier this month. An investigation by NPR and Frontline found that the program creates fewer affordable units and at greater cost than it did 20 years ago. The impact of losing the subsidy on housing policy is probably dwarfed by another big change in both the Senate and House versions of tax reform. Both bills essentially gut a deduction that allows homeowners to reduce their taxable income by the amount they pay in interest on their mortgages. The mortgage interest deduction, along with deductions for state and local taxes, are tax expenditures worth more than $100 billion annually ― making them the largest plank of U.S. housing policy in terms of dollars, by far. Eliminating the mortgage subsidy would knock home prices down 10 percent, according to a study commissioned earlier this year by the National Association of Realtors, which opposes the tax plan.While the loss of private activity bonds may reduce affordable housing, the loss of the mortgage interest deduction could make housing more affordable across the board. Diana McIver, another Texas developer, said she’s afraid she’ll lose financing for a proposed senior-living complex in Austin. She has asked the investor and the bond issuer to try to speed up a closing that had been planned for early next year. “If we can close by Dec. 31, we’re fine, but if we can’t, and they do away with private activity bonds, then we’re totally out of luck,” McIver said. “Quite frankly, I am not sure that the members of the House of Representatives really understand the relationship between private activity bonds and affordable housing.”"
26,POLITICS,Senate Republicans Slip 'Flimflam' Paid Leave Proposal Into Tax Bill,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paid-family-medical-leave-senate-tax-bill_us_5a0de492e4b0c0b2f2f8c708,The provision is really just a tax break for companies that already offer some paid leave.,2017-11-17,The proposal is modeled on similar legislation pushed by GOP Sen. Deb Fischer.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0de55a1500009902858708.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Tucked inside the Senate Republicans’ latest tax bill is a proposal they’re touting as a paid family leave plan.It’s not. The provision, as written in the version of the bill released Wednesday, offers companies a small tax credit for giving workers as little as two weeks of paid time off for family and medical leave. What’s covered by “family and medical leave” is not clearly defined. The concept is modeled on similar legislation pushed by Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) for the past few years.Fischer seems thrilled. “This is a big step toward enacting the first nationwide paid leave policy in U.S. history,” she said in a statement Wednesday.While the measure is certainly a sign that paid leave has finally become a major bipartisan issue, what’s on offer here will do little to address the needs of new parents in the United States, according to family advocates, some conservative economists and, well, common sense.“It’s a flimflam,” said Ellen Bravo, co-director at Family Values@Work, a national coalition of paid leave advocates. “It’s pretending to say we’re giving you something new that people urgently need when, in fact, it’s a giveaway to the bigger corporations that can already afford to do it.”The U.S. is one of just a handful of countries that do not mandate paid maternity leave. It is the only advanced economy in the world that requires no time off for new parents. This failing has devastating economic consequences. For starters, the U.S. has a lower percentage of women in the workforce than most other similarly situated countries. Researchers have even found a correlation between infant mortality rates and the amount of time mothers take off after the arrival of a child.Even though an overwhelming majority of Americans believe parents should get paid time off to care for a newborn, only 15 percent of U.S. workers currently do, according to federal data. About one-quarter of mothers go back to work less than two weeks after giving birth. Others wind up quitting their jobs and relying on government benefits to squeak by. There’s increasing awareness among Democrats and Republicans that this is an urgent issue. Even President Donald Trump included a proposal for six weeks of paid time off in his draft budget released in May, although he’s done little to push the matter since.The Senate’s family leave provision was not part of the tax bill passed Thursday by the House of Representatives, and it’s not clear whether it will make it into the final version of the tax plan.There are a few problems with the tax credit itself, said Vicki Shabo, a vice-president at the National Partnership for Women and Families. It’s relatively small. A company could pay a worker as little as 50 percent of his or her salary and then would get 12.5 percent of that money back via a tax credit. It offers little incentive for companies to start offering leave ― they’d only get their money back at the end of the year.And perhaps most disheartening, the tax credit would be temporary, expiring in 2019 ― which hardly gives employers time to get the new benefit up and rolling.“This is a way for Republicans to check a box that says, ‘We care about paid leave,’ without ensuring any workers are actually getting paid leave,” said Shabo.Several conservative economists agree. This kind of tax credit would most likely be embraced by companies that already offer paid family leave, wrote Aparna Mathur, a resident scholar in economic policy at the American Enterprise Institute.“This is only a small step forward in this debate, not a giant leap,” Mathur said. “Much more can and should be done.”The reality is that no one knows whether tax incentives would translate into more paid leave, Abby M. McCloskey wrote in the right-wing National Review. The approach outlined in Fischer’s earlier bill (which the current measure is modeled on) “leaves much to be desired,” McCloskey said.Ben Gitis, labor policy director at the conservative American Action Forum, is more optimistic about the provision. “It could work,” he told HuffPost. He likes that the tax credit could be claimed only for workers who earn less than $72,000 a year, targeting those who need paid leave the most.But he too noted that “no one really knows” if tax credits will ultimately lead to more paid leave.There is consensus on what would work, Shabo, Bravo and McCloskey pointed out: enacting a policy that gives American workers paid time off. A handful of states ― including California and New Jersey― already offer paid leave. It works like this: Employees and employers, depending on the state, contribute small amounts of money to create an insurance pool that covers paid leave, much the way unemployment insurance works.“Limited paid-leave programs have been found to increase work-force participation, raise wages, reduce use of government benefits, increase leave times, and improve children’s and mothers’ health outcomes — especially for low-wage parents for whom the alternative is often welfare,” McCloskey wrote.And she asked: “Why not move forward with a program we know works?”CORRECTION: A previous version of this story indicated Connecticut was one of a few states that offer paid family leave. In fact, it only offers sick leave."
27,IMPACT,Why You Should Think Twice Before Opting for Free 2-Day Shipping,Laura Paddison,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/2-day-shipping-environment_us_5a0e1374e4b045cf43706864,The hidden environmental cost of your online shopping.,2017-11-17,"Platooning trucks which talk wirelessly to each other to maintain the same speed can reduce drag, saving fuel and cutting emissions.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0e14581800003300f6c9a1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"We’ve all been there. Running low on batteries, diapers, socks ― whatever ― go online, order and click the free two-day delivery option. Because, why not? It’s free and it’s fast. What people may not realize is that the speedy delivery comes at an environmental cost. A new video released by the University of California and Vox as part of their Climate Lab series aims to draw attention to the unintended impacts of our need for instant gratification by highlighting the staggering scale of the digital shopping revolution.Since 2009, U.S. Postal Service deliveries have increased by 65 percent, according to UC Davis. As the holiday shopping season approaches, it’s estimated that online sales for November and December alone will hit $107.4 billion.E-commerce has made people’s lives easier. Nearly 80 percent of Americans shop online, and they can do so any time, anywhere. One in five people even do it while using the bathroom.It can also be greener than going to physical stores, since people don’t need to jump in their cars to get to there. A Massachusetts Institute of Technology study found that a traditional store-visiting shopper had a carbon footprint almost two times that of an online shopper.However, there’s an important caveat. This environmental advantage of online shopping disappears if the shopper selects speedy delivery. “These rush deliveries are the ones breaking those benefits because now there is no time to consolidate, so there will be more trips for less cargo,” said Miguel Jaller, an assistant professor at UC Davis.In extreme cases, items may have to be flown in from another state or from another country. But the bigger issue is that companies have less time to organize the most efficient transport, which means trucks are sent out half full, increasing the number of trips and vehicles on the road. Carbon emissions per customer and per product shoot up as a result. Why this matters? These emissions trap heat, contributing to climate change.A multi-year study by the University of Delaware, focusing on Newark, Delaware, found that online shopping burdened the transportation system in terms of speed, travel times and emissions. Delivery trucks added to air pollution and wear and tear on the roads, the report noted. “Generally speaking, slower ground shipping is the greener choice over air shipping,” Mingxin Li, co-author of the study and a scientist at the Delaware Center for Transportation, said. “The prevalence of expensive, inefficient, and environmentally unsustainable quick, free delivery options, air freight or partial-load deliveries are becoming increasingly common.”What are the solutions? Smart traffic lights are one idea in UC’s video. These are being tested in cities, including Los Angeles. The city’s system uses sensors, cameras and computers to adjust signals responsively to keep traffic moving smoothly. This can make journeys faster and reduce idling, which cuts down emissions. While such systems are helpful, traffic may only be a marginal influence on pollution in some cities, said Josué Velázquez, director of the MIT Sustainable Logistics Department. “There are many other factors that affect the transportation emissions during delivery,” he said, such as the hilliness of the route. Then there is “platooning.” Wirelessly connected trucks communicate with each other, maintaining a constant speed in a close line at highway speeds. Supporters say this can reduce congestion, lowering emissions and improving air quality. A recent paper from research company TNO says platooning could reduce fuel use by around 10 percent. But reducing the impact of shipping is also about changing shoppers’ behavior and some of the impulses of consumerism, said Jaller. “We need to control ourselves. I think there’s also a lot of impulsive buying and induced demand.”   Free speedy shipping for all these goods may seem a no-brainer, but “we need to know that it’s not free for the system and for the environment,” Jaller said. “So we are not paying that externality.” Jaller said changing consumer behavior is the way to solve the problem, whether that’s through incentives, taxes, or simply transparency about the actual cost of online products and services.One idea gaining ground is a “green button” on shopping websites, which allows customers to make the eco-friendly choice of waiting a little longer for their delivery to ensure it is shipped in the most energy-efficient way.Green buttons are something Velázquez has been testing at MIT. Providing an option that says “same-day delivery is equivalent to killing 3,000 trees” compared with one that says “if you wait three to four days, then it’s equivalent to killing 10 trees, and by the way we are going to plant 15,″ can really drive behavior, he said.Of course, delivery is just part of the impact of the goods we consume, which a study in the Journal of Industrial Ecology estimates contributes to more than 60 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions.

For Art Tanderup, a Nebraska farmer who spent the last five years crusading to keep TransCanada from building the conduit over his modest 160 acres, the spill confirmed his worst fears. He was even more distraught when President Donald Trump reversed course and announced he would approve Keystone XL pipeline days after taking office in January. Now, Tanderup’s concerns seem even more warranted, after the existing Keystone pipeline spilled again on Thursday, this time leaking 210,000 gallons ― 12 times more toxic tar sands oil than before ― on a grassy field in the remote northeastern corner of the Mount Rushmore State. It is the largest spill in Keystone’s history.“We’re religious people,” Tanderup, 65, told HuffPost by phone on Friday. “It makes you think maybe the creator is sending us a strong message.” Keystone XL was the subject of seven-year fight between environmentalists and the Obama administration before Trump reversed course. Native activists in the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation ― roughly 200 miles from the latest spill site in Amherst, South Dakota ― waged a monthslong battle to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline, which Trump pushed ahead earlier this year. Environmentalists, tribes, concerned ranchers and scientists have been saying for years that the potential for catastrophic spills ― and the impacts they would have on land and water ― far outweigh the perceived benefits of new pipelines. Pipelines reduce the cost of shipping crude by train ― an expense an industry struggling with low oil prices has been eager to eliminate. Trump vowed to jumpstart the United States economy by promoting fossil fuels, slashing environmental regulations and making it easier for drilling and pipeline projects to begin. He signed an executive action in January making Keystone XL and the Dakota Access pipeline top priorities. The State Department approved Keystone XL in March, the same month the Army approved completion of Dakota Access without an environmental study. Thousands of demonstrators, including members of dozens of indigenous tribes, descended on the nation’s capital in protest, demanding that the Trump administration respect native sovereignty. Construction on the Dakota Access pipeline finished a month later. In August, the Nebraska Public Service Commission began contentious hearings to assess whether Keystone XL would benefit the state. The regulators are scheduled to vote Monday on whether to approve the pipeline, but are barred under state law from considering the South Dakota spill in their decision.The proposed 1,179-mile pipeline would, as the name implies, extend a shortcut for Canadian tar sands pumped through the existing Keystone Pipeline to refineries in Texas. It would carry 830,000 barrels of oil per day, producing emissions equivalent to putting 5.6 million new cars on the road, according to estimates from the environmental nonprofit Friends of the Earth. Oil from tar sands ― a noxious mix of sand, clay and bitumen, a thick, viscous oil ― is considered one of the dirtiest fossil fuels.The proposed route through Nebraska traverses the Sandhills, a region of ancient prairies and sand dunes. It would also cut through the Ogallala, the largest aquifer in North America, at times going underwater. The rock formation, spongey with gravel, silt, sand, and clay, formed 10 million years ago and replenishes very slowly from surface rivers and streams. The water level is particularly close to the surface in Nebraska, making it especially vulnerable in a spill. In a 2011 analysis, University of Nebraska professor Dr. John Stansbury concluded that TransCanada “made significant flawed and inappropriate assumptions about the frequency and severity of expected spills from its pipelines.” While the company estimated Keystone XL would have 11 spills of 50 barrels or more over a 50-year period, Stansbury pegged the figure at 91. He also estimated there would be approximately two major spills per year, some potentially releasing as much as 180,000 barrels.For its vote Monday, the Public Service Commission cannot “evaluate safety considerations, including the risk or impact of spills or leaks from the major oil pipeline,” according to rules laid out in Nebraska’s Major Oil Pipeline Siting Act of 2011.However, the law allows the commission to consider “economic and social impacts,” compliance with state and local regulations, and evidence that the pipeline would damage or deplete natural resources.Deb Collins, a spokeswoman for the Public Service Commission, declined to comment on how the Keystone spill would factor into Monday’s decision, and referred HuffPost to the statute.  “The Public Service Commission rules say they cannot factor in safety,” Tanderup said. “But, good heavens, I don’t know how you could be a sane person and not say, ’Wow, this could happen in our Sandhills, our Ogallala aquifer, and look at the disaster we’d have.”The latest spill is “an awful incident, and it reinforces everything that we’ve been saying all along,” said Jane Kleeb, president of Bold Nebraska, a progressive group fighting against Keystone XL. “There’s literally no public interest that this pipeline would bring.”David Domina, the lawyer representing the 90 Nebraska landowners opposed to the pipeline, said it’s the commission’s duty to ignore the spill in South Dakota. But he’s confident the commissioners will reject TransCanada’s request. During the trial over the past year, TransCanada failed to defend their two main arguments for how Keystone XL would benefit Nebraska, he said.The company initially promised a jobs boom, but offered no rebuttal when an economist using the firm’s own data calculated that the project would yield only nine permanent positions and less than one-fifth of the temporary construction gigs initially outlined.TransCanada pitched the pipeline as a steady stream of tax revenue, but limited its forecasts to 15 years. By the 16th year, the tax gains for the state would drop off to zero. Because the company planned to operate the pipeline for 50 years, that means the conduit would be a drain on state resources for 35 years. Domina said that would cost at least $14 million, not counting indirect expenses such as if the company ever called on state police, used highways or required a truck to be weighed.The company also failed to justify the proposed route for the pipeline, Domina said. The firm insisted it could not alter the route through Nebraska due to legal restrictions in South Dakota, where the Keystone pipeline is located. But during cross examination, a company engineer admitted TransCanada based that argument on a narrow work permit technicality. “The trial proceedings were not beneficial or favorable to TransCanada,” Domina told HuffPost by phone. “They were a disaster for TransCanada and a success for the landowners.”TransCanada did not return emails requesting comment Friday. Bu in a statement posted to its website, the company said, “The safety of the public and environment are our top priorities and we will continue to provide updates as they become available.”For Allison Reville, a political activist and member of the Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate Sioux Tribe, the incident this week is exactly what she and other pipeline opponents have been warning about and knew would happen. Wahpeton’s reservation is located approximately 30 miles east of the site of the spill.“This is a big deal,” she said, adding that she fears the spill could leave the aquifer system and local drinking water contaminated. While the cleanup effort will be important, Renville said she hopes the incident will discourage officials from approving Keystone XL and serve as a wake-up call for the residents of red South Dakota, in particular the farming community. “We’ve been talking, myself specifically, for the last year — ’Where is South Dakota? Where are our famers? Why isn’t anybody sticking up for us? Where is everybody else downriver?’” she said. “We’ve been asking people to stand in solidarity with us and to help us protect the water, to help us protect the land. Just as much as we hold all of our resources sacred, there’s a farming community who rely on everything too.” “We need people to wake up and realize that this isn’t just a threat to Native American life,” she added. “This is a threat to everything that we know.”"

Trump vowed to jumpstart the United States economy by promoting fossil fuels, slashing environmental regulations and making it easier for drilling and pipeline projects to begin. He signed an executive action in January making Keystone XL and the Dakota Access pipeline top priorities. The State Department approved Keystone XL in March, the same month the Army approved completion of Dakota Access without an environmental study. Thousands of demonstrators, including members of dozens of indigenous tribes, descended on the nation’s capital in protest, demanding that the Trump administration respect native sovereignty. Construction on the Dakota Access pipeline finished a month later. In August, the Nebraska Public Service Commission began contentious hearings to assess whether Keystone XL would benefit the state. The regulators are scheduled to vote Monday on whether to approve the pipeline, but are barred under state law from considering the South Dakota spill in their decision.The proposed 1,179-mile pipeline would, as the name implies, extend a shortcut for Canadian tar sands pumped through the existing Keystone Pipeline to refineries in Texas. It would carry 830,000 barrels of oil per day, producing emissions equivalent to putting 5.6 million new cars on the road, according to estimates from the environmental nonprofit Friends of the Earth. Oil from tar sands ― a noxious mix of sand, clay and bitumen, a thick, viscous oil ― is considered one of the dirtiest fossil fuels.The proposed route through Nebraska traverses the Sandhills, a region of ancient prairies and sand dunes. It would also cut through the Ogallala, the largest aquifer in North America, at times going underwater. The rock formation, spongey with gravel, silt, sand, and clay, formed 10 million years ago and replenishes very slowly from surface rivers and streams. The water level is particularly close to the surface in Nebraska, making it especially vulnerable in a spill. In a 2011 analysis, University of Nebraska professor Dr. John Stansbury concluded that TransCanada “made significant flawed and inappropriate assumptions about the frequency and severity of expected spills from its pipelines.” While the company estimated Keystone XL would have 11 spills of 50 barrels or more over a 50-year period, Stansbury pegged the figure at 91. He also estimated there would be approximately two major spills per year, some potentially releasing as much as 180,000 barrels.For its vote Monday, the Public Service Commission cannot “evaluate safety considerations, including the risk or impact of spills or leaks from the major oil pipeline,” according to rules laid out in Nebraska’s Major Oil Pipeline Siting Act of 2011.However, the law allows the commission to consider “economic and social impacts,” compliance with state and local regulations, and evidence that the pipeline would damage or deplete natural resources.Deb Collins, a spokeswoman for the Public Service Commission, declined to comment on how the Keystone spill would factor into Monday’s decision, and referred HuffPost to the statute.  “The Public Service Commission rules say they cannot factor in safety,” Tanderup said. “But, good heavens, I don’t know how you could be a sane person and not say, ’Wow, this could happen in our Sandhills, our Ogallala aquifer, and look at the disaster we’d have.”The latest spill is “an awful incident, and it reinforces everything that we’ve been saying all along,” said Jane Kleeb, president of Bold Nebraska, a progressive group fighting against Keystone XL. “There’s literally no public interest that this pipeline would bring.”David Domina, the lawyer representing the 90 Nebraska landowners opposed to the pipeline, said it’s the commission’s duty to ignore the spill in South Dakota. But he’s confident the commissioners will reject TransCanada’s request. During the trial over the past year, TransCanada failed to defend their two main arguments for how Keystone XL would benefit Nebraska, he said.The company initially promised a jobs boom, but offered no rebuttal when an economist using the firm’s own data calculated that the project would yield only nine permanent positions and less than one-fifth of the temporary construction gigs initially outlined.TransCanada pitched the pipeline as a steady stream of tax revenue, but limited its forecasts to 15 years. By the 16th year, the tax gains for the state would drop off to zero. Because the company planned to operate the pipeline for 50 years, that means the conduit would be a drain on state resources for 35 years. Domina said that would cost at least $14 million, not counting indirect expenses such as if the company ever called on state police, used highways or required a truck to be weighed.The company also failed to justify the proposed route for the pipeline, Domina said. The firm insisted it could not alter the route through Nebraska due to legal restrictions in South Dakota, where the Keystone pipeline is located. But during cross examination, a company engineer admitted TransCanada based that argument on a narrow work permit technicality. “The trial proceedings were not beneficial or favorable to TransCanada,” Domina told HuffPost by phone. “They were a disaster for TransCanada and a success for the landowners.”TransCanada did not return emails requesting comment Friday. Bu in a statement posted to its website, the company said, “The safety of the public and environment are our top priorities and we will continue to provide updates as they become available.”For Allison Reville, a political activist and member of the Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate Sioux Tribe, the incident this week is exactly what she and other pipeline opponents have been warning about and knew would happen. Wahpeton’s reservation is located approximately 30 miles east of the site of the spill.“This is a big deal,” she said, adding that she fears the spill could leave the aquifer system and local drinking water contaminated. While the cleanup effort will be important, Renville said she hopes the incident will discourage officials from approving Keystone XL and serve as a wake-up call for the residents of red South Dakota, in particular the farming community. “We’ve been talking, myself specifically, for the last year — ’Where is South Dakota? Where are our famers? Why isn’t anybody sticking up for us? Where is everybody else downriver?’” she said. “We’ve been asking people to stand in solidarity with us and to help us protect the water, to help us protect the land. Just as much as we hold all of our resources sacred, there’s a farming community who rely on everything too.” “We need people to wake up and realize that this isn’t just a threat to Native American life,” she added. “This is a threat to everything that we know.”"
32,ARTS & CULTURE,Why A $450 Million Painting Attributed To Leonardo Da Vinci Worries Art Historians,Katherine Brooks and Priscilla Frank,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/leonardo-da-vinci-450-million_us_5a0d9eeee4b0b37054f4d12c,"The artwork has been hotly debated for years, but its sale signals one thing absolutely: a ""very unequal, even obscene distribution of wealth in the world.""",2017-11-17,"""Salvator Mundi"" is a portrait of Christ that's been attributed to Leonardo da Vinci circa 1500.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0dca20180000aa09f6c876.jpeg?cache=xwBDocLLKA&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Ahead of Wednesday’s record-breaking auction at Christie’s, during which a painting attributed to Leonardo da Vinci sold for a throat-clenching $450 million, art critic Jerry Saltz voiced some doubts. Saltz, in an essay for New York magazine, called the portrait of Christ “dead” and “inert,” suggesting that the artwork ― which had been predicted to fetch only $100 million ― is “a sham.” It’s “no Leonardo,” he wrote. Saltz, neither a historian nor an expert in old master work, went on to suggest that Christie’s sale would end poorly. “No museum on Earth can afford an iffy picture like this at these prices.”And then “Salvator Mundi (Savior of the World)” a 500-year-old portrait of Christ thought to be a copy when it was plucked from an estate sale for a measly $10,000 in 2005, sold for nearly half a billion dollars to an undisclosed private buyer. Suddenly, the controversy surrounding the painting’s authenticity ― its whereabouts over these last few centuries and whether multiple restorations had indelibly altered its surface ― became white noise. Christie’s had managed to rocket past previous auction benchmarks, brokering a historic sum for the seller, Russian billionaire Dmitry E. Rybolovlev’s family trust.Perhaps a museum lacked funds to secure the questionable picture, but a nameless member of the 1 percent surely possessed pockets deep enough.To most people, $450 million is an unimaginable sum. As Hrag Vartanian at Hyperallergic pointed out, that’s more money than the total estimated cost of the new Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City: $422 million. (It’s also reportedly more money than the Koch brothers are expecting to spend in the 2018 election cycle: $300 million to $400 million.)“This is a very small step for mankind, but a big step for the art market,” Frank Zöllner, a German art historian and professor at Universität Leipzig, who’s written a book on Leonardo, told HuffPost in a statement over email. “A heavily damaged painting by Leonardo, which was created with the substantial involvement of his workshop after 1507 or even later, achieved a record price, which is significantly higher than the sums that are called for modern masters.”“Of course, [‘Salvator’] is the symbol of a very unequal, even obscene distribution of wealth in the world,” Zöllner added.Art experts expressed concern with the $450 million price tag, well above the previous record for a painting sold at auction ― $179 million for Picasso’s “Les Femmes d’Alger,” set in 2015. “I am deeply shocked by” the price, Stephen Campbell, an art history professor at Johns Hopkins University who focuses on Renaissance art, explained. “As a colleague said to me today, the 1 percent — who owns half the planet’s wealth — are looking for the last few places to deposit their wealth. This is a very limited, overvalued sector of the art market. ... The pricing could be controlled in such a way that a public institution could afford it. This is not a celebratory moment.”Campbell’s unease stems, in part, from the painting’s murky history, a pressure point for a portion of the scholarly community. Campbell saw “Salvator Mundi” in person six years ago. At the time, he was impressed by the lineup of experts willing to vouch for the work, as well as with the scrupulous condition report Christie’s released elucidating the painting’s entire conservation history. The report notes that X-rays and infrared reflectography revealed the signature pentimenti, or visible changes, that helped confirm the painting’s attribution.“That being said,” Campbell continued, “there is very little Leonardo visible in the painting that was seen yesterday.”Campbell estimated that only 20 percent of the painting’s surface was rendered in Leonardo’s 16th-century Italian workshop. The rest was carefully reconstructed by conservators, including Dianne Dwyer Modestini. And even that scant 20 percent is in question; there’s a possibility it was executed by Leonardo’s assistants, meticulously trained to mimic his style, and not by the old master himself. The true hand of the artist, Campbell said, is impossible to definitively discern. “Most post-1500 [Leonardo] paintings are hybrids,” Campbell said. As a result, “when art historians say Leonardo, they’re talking about a category,” he explained. “It’s a ‘Leonardo effect.’”Campbell is not the only historian with suspicions. Art adviser Todd Levin and Sotheby’s senior international specialist Philip Hook have also expressed measured doubt about the work and its provenance. The painting that once hung in the collection of Charles I of England now appears cracked and worn, overpainted and slightly reimagined. Its whereabouts from 1763 to 1900 are unknown. It resurfaced, only to be sold in 1958 for £45 and disappear once again ― until it popped up in 2005, courtesy of art dealer Alexander Parish. Between 2013 and 2017, the then-consortium-authenticated painting sold once for over $75 million, and again for $127.5 million.“The attribution of this painting is hotly debated among Leonardo scholars and Renaissance art historians as it always happens with the discovery of new works by a major artist,” Francesca Fiorani, associate dean for the arts and humanities and professor of art history at the University of Virginia, told HuffPost. “Time will tell if the attribution of this panel to Leonardo will stick or whether in a few years the painting will look very different.”In a statement to HuffPost, a representative for Christie’s cited Luke Syson, curator of Italian paintings before 1500 and head of research at the National Gallery in London; Keith Christiansen, chair of European paintings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art; Vincent Delieuvin, ‎curator of 16th century Italian painting at the Musée du Louvre; and Martin Kemp, emeritus professor of the history of art at the University of Oxford, among others, as experts willing to endorse the work as Leonardo. Kemp reiterated his support of the attribution during a phone call with HuffPost on Thursday.“There were some self-seeking publicity people, journalists, who tried to denigrate the painting, which was so expensive ― that was so valued. But they weren’t serious objections,” Kemp said. As evidence of Leonardo’s handiwork, Kemp homed in on several aspects of the work, including the mysterious orb that appears in Christ’s hand.“It wasn’t like an ordinary sphere,” Kemp recalled of his time gazing at the painting in person. “It looked like rock crystal. ... It’s not the normal ‘Mundi’ sphere. This is the sphere of the fixed stars, of the cosmos. So Leonardo transmuted it from being a savior of the world to being a savior of the cosmos. That’s the kind of genius he was capable of.”As for the sum paid to secure the “Salvator,” Kemp agreed it’s “astonishing.” But the painting, which he described as the “spiritual equivalent to ‘Mona Lisa,’” is, he said, “worth what someone’s willing to pay for it.”“The people who are paying these sums of money undoubtedly would have undertaken due research,” he added. “It is largely a restoration, and it is a damaged picture, but so are a lot of old master works. It’s not the best I’ve ever seen, and it’s not the worst.”At the end of the day, Campbell concluded that the doubt surrounding the alleged Leonardo doesn’t matter, because, for all practical purposes, the attribution of the artwork was confirmed by the Christie’s sale.“As a colleague of mine said, ‘Nothing makes a Leonardo more than a hundred- million-dollar price tag,’” Campbell said. “The valuation works in reverse to justify the attribution.” Ultimately, Campbell said that he could accept the painting as a Leonardo, but he could not reconcile with its price. “It’s become a trophy, a market fetish. It’s being taken away from the interest of scholars,” he said.Lynn Catterson, a part-time lecturer at Columbia University who specializes in the Renaissance, the historical art market and 19th-century Florence, similarly described the painting’s value as “ridiculous and endemic to a planet whose economic disparities are worse than severe. And that is leaving aside issues of authenticity and provenance.”As Tim Schneider wrote for Artnet News, Christie’s revised fee structure saddles buyers capable of purchasing works over $4 million with a 12.5-percent premium, which ultimately carried the final $400 million bid for “Salvator” to a total payout closer to the half-billion mark. For cultural institutions with limited budgets, the premium allows private buyers to outbid them at auction, leaving cultural touchstones in the hands of the ultra-rich.This year’s Global Wealth Report, published on Tuesday, confirmed that 1 percent of the world’s population owns half the world’s total household wealth. Just as money has the power to shape democracy, so does it threaten to rewrite art history. If a seismic price tag becomes a more powerful indicator of masterworks than scholarly consensus, provenance and authentication, the sale sets a frightening precedent for, as Saltz put it, #FakeArtNews.“Most people do not seem to realize that an attribution is an opinion and, as such, legally is not binding,” Maurizio Seracini, an art diagnostician who’s worked extensively with Leonardo’s work, said. “Nevertheless, investors are purchasing art at incredible prices based just on opinions! No wonder why the production of fakes is booming internationally!”A $450 million valuation is then, by most accounts, unbelievable. However, if any artist could posthumously pull it off, Leonardo might be the most probable candidate. “On one level, a staggering figure in the art market reminds me of global financial disparity,” Bronwen Wilson, a professor of Renaissance and early modern art at UCLA, said. “But I also find myself ruminating on Dan Brown, video games and lineups to see Leonardo’s works ― for the ‘Mona Lisa,’ ‘The Last Supper,’ and exhibitions ― which is to say that there is also something about Leonardo’s particular purchase on the cultural imagination that plays a role in this instance.”The cult of Leonardo extends far and wide. He’s become the mythical manifestation of interdisciplinary genius, a superhuman amalgamation of artistic talent, scientific acumen and unbridled curiosity. And there is still another Leonardo work in private hands: “The Madonna of the Yarnwinder.”As Campbell mentioned, it will be interesting to see what happens if and when this final masterpiece hits the auction block. Perhaps “Madonna” won’t match the hefty price tag of “Salvator,” suggesting soaring auction prices have reached their tipping point. However, if values continue to inflate, the art market’s steel bubble will continue to serve as a glorified piggy bank for the 1 percent.This post has been updated to clarify the effect of Christie’s buyer’s premium."

Some 64,000 people died of a drug overdose last year. More than were killed in the entire Vietnam War. More than from gun violence and car crashes. More than at the peak of the AIDS epidemic.The worst offenders are pharmaceutical opiates — dispensed by doctors, not dealers — so widely used that opioid addiction has become the worst epidemic in the nation’s history. When opiate addicts run out of money for pills, they turn to the street. Dirt-cheap and abundantly available, a bag of heroin is comparable in cost to a six-pack of craft beer.More than 33,000 people died of heroin overdose last year. One of them could easily have been my daughter.I found your daughter on the street. That’s what the unknown caller on my cell phone told me on New Year’s Eve 2007 — a moment seared into memory as my entry point into a subterranean nightmare world. My brain couldn’t find an image for my beautiful, gifted, college-educated daughter, working as a cook at a 4-star restaurant in the city, on the street somewhere in midtown Manhattan. On the street with what?The one-word answer: Heroin.That single word branded a scarlet H on my heart. Shame was my closest companion. Stigma was the leper colony of junkies and their families in which I was sequesteredSince then, epidemic numbers of parents have received some version of The Call, heard the same horrifying word, and entered the same nightmare world. Our children are dying, 100 every day. Those who survive are shooting up in McDonald’s bathrooms, wandering the streets, packing homeless shelters and prisons. Some are begging for detox and treatment that is still largely unavailable.When there is nothing left for you to want for your child but survival, the world contracts to the size of a room strewed with needles and blackened spoons. A cell phone transmitting her voice — barely recognizable with its heroin slur, begging for money — rips your heart to pieces but, in this topsy-turvy world, is a relief, indicating that she’s still breathing.I left a 35-year psychotherapy practice and turned all my force to trying to save my child’s life. It took me years to accept that I could take care of her at home, bar her from my house, have the court mandate her into residential treatment, pay for one rehab after another, go to family meetings in Intensive Outpatient Programs, consult Harvard-educated addiction experts, stalk her to keep her in my sights, love her unconditionally — and none of this would stop her from destroying herself.In the end, she chose to save herself. She’s been clean for two years and is trying to rebuild her life from the ground up. The answer to the question Why? that haunts every mother of an addict is just as mysterious for why she stopped using heroin as why she started.But I do know this: my daughter’s choice for recovery had something to do with spending time in treatment centers where she was exposed to the idea of seeing herself as someone with a treatable disease. Also, getting herself on methadone and knowing her family wasn’t giving up on her. Perhaps most importantly, finding someone who helped her kick the habit beneath the habit—the habit of thinking that she was irreparably damaged goods.To make the choice for recovery, she had to get out from under the shame and stigma that kept her in the stranglehold of addiction.The same is true for me. For years, I saw myself as a Bad Mother and failed human being — I’d raised a junkie. I became adept at re-routing friendly questions about what my girl was up to. I sank into the abyss of secrecy, unable to say the word heroin to anyone but my husband, one friend, and members of groups sworn to confidentiality who shared the same shameful secret.To break through the stigma, I had to find a way to speak the unspeakable.Stigma=DeathHeroin deaths quadrupled in the decade between 2002 and 2013 and have risen sharply every year since then. Statistics on overdose deaths tend to be underreported. The chief medical examiner of Milwaukee recently described the volume of autopsies as a “tsunami.”The corpses are mounting. So many that they have overwhelmed the capacity of officials in many cities to count them and of coroner’s morgues to house them. So many that coroners have started to rely on “mobile morgue trailers,” currently being used for the overflow of the dead in cities in Ohio.The consensus among experts is that half a million people will die of opioid addiction in the coming decade — a number equivalent to the entire city of Baltimore.The fact is: we are letting them die because they’re junkies. Is there a word in the English language that better conveys the essence of stigma than the word junkie?In Boston, junkies have been confined to their own ghetto—a mile of treeless streets, methadone clinics, homeless shelters, and a treatment center. Methadone Mile belongs to the addicts. They shoot up on the sidewalks, nod out on the benches, walk the streets with the signature slow-motion shuffle of the smack addict. The Mile is what stigma looks like geographically. It’s where my daughter has gone every morning for the past eight years to get her methadone dose, an area she leaves as quickly as possible to avoid meeting up with the dealers. On the Mile, the smell of stigma is palpable and it’s the smell of despair.I’m old enough to remember gay activists carrying signs saying Silence=Death during the AIDS epidemic. Eventually they got the government and the CDC to pay attention. In the trenches of the opiate epidemic, Stigma=Death. The bigotry that condemned gay men to death — if faggots are dying, they are bringing it on themselves with their disgusting behavior — is the way many people think about junkies.In the grip of their addiction, drug addicts do reprehensible things. They lie. They steal. They rob their grandmothers. They forge checks and sell their mothers’ jewelry for a few bags of dope. A brain hijacked by heroin will do these things and worse. My daughter was no exception. The only line she drew, one she wouldn’t cross even when completely strung out, was not stealing her sister’s disability money.But that doesn’t mean that addicts don’t have remorse or are without conscience. Nobody is harder on an addict than the addict. They will not forgive themselves for what they are doing to those they love — which only fortifies the stigma and fuels the addiction.Stigma is the lynchpin that keeps addiction in place. The toxic core of stigma — shame, secrecy, and silence — guarantees continuous relapse and makes death more likely for the addict because it freezes all possibility of change.De-stigmatizing and Treating the Disease of AddictionAddiction is a disease. That’s what the science tells us. But culturally, addiction is still largely viewed as a visible stamp of depravity.It took Obama almost his entire presidency to cozy up to the idea that addicts deserve treatment. In his last year of office, he put forth a bill recognizing addiction as a public health issue and recommending 1.1 billion dollars in funding for prevention, treatment and recovery. The Congressional allotment of funding for this bill so far? Nada.Trump weighed in a few weeks ago, declaring the opioid epidemic a public health emergency — again, without a penny to fund disaster relief for addicts. In fact, Trump has done his best to propel the Republican agenda that would drastically reduce Medicaid monies to the states and further decimate the pathetically inadequate funding for treatment, condemning addicts without insurance to sickness without hope. And Attorney General Sessions has re-affirmed the failed policies of the past ‘Drug War’ in which the fundamental approach is incarceration.Currently, only about 10 percent of addicts make it into treatment while over 50 percent of people in federal prison are there for drug offenses. Any mother of an opiate addict knows that when the addict is ready for treatment and there’s none available, the missed opportunity is tragic. With addiction treatment, readiness is all. Turned away from detox and treatment, addicts are encouraged to give up.The stigma of addiction comes largely from treating addicts like criminals. We make them pariahs and then use their outlier status as proof that they aren’t like anyone else who needs help.Junkies are seen as the lowest of the low, basically unredeemable. Shooting up isn’t like drinking Grey Goose martinis or snorting lines of cocaine at high-end parties. Heroin is pumped into collapsed veins in dark rooms full of garbage and bloody needles.What kind of person would do this? As it turns out, anyone with a genetic predisposition who is at high risk for addiction because of other factors, like chronic pain or trauma. The childhood sex abuse survivor. The teenager who downed oxycontin as a party drug. The injured college athlete who took the standard medication prescribed by a doctor who was encouraged by Purdue Pharma to write scripts for what it claimed was the best ‘non-addictive’ pain-reliever available.Through the lens of stigma, one line of thought has been: why bother treating heroin addicts when they only relapse after treatment? The reigning approach to drug addiction treatment in this country appears to concur that addicts don’t deserve to be treated unless they are already well enough to renounce the drug they’re addicted to. Most treatment centers insist that those who enter maintain total sobriety or be thrown out. The lung cancer patient who smoked two packs a day for forty years is not told at the hospital door Sorry, no treatment for you because you brought it on yourself and you’re still smoking. The diabetes patient addicted to Entenmann’s chocolate cake is not told to come back for treatment when she’s serious about giving up sugar. The workaholic CEO on his third heart attack is not admonished by his doctor I’ll treat you when you stop working. The culture that stigmatizes addicts stigmatizes all people with mental illness. Seen as ‘Other,’ it’s easy to ostracize them. But given the demographic sweep of the epidemic, this is getting harder. Addicts are everywhere, in every geographic, racial, gender, ethnic, religious, and economic group. Though they live their lives in extremis, opioid addicts now comprise a vast population of folks familiar to us.The new face of heroin is young, well-educated, and white. The idea of addiction as a disease has made some cultural headway precisely because we have seen the addicts and they are us.Breaking the Stigma Increasingly, it is family members of addicts, particularly mothers, who have been challenging the stigma and breaking the silence about opiate addiction. We are writing our children’s obituaries and openly revealing overdose as the cause. We are supporting one another to speak out without shame in online groups like The Addict’s Mother. We are marching in Washington with groups like Fed Up!, demanding a rational public health policy for addiction and the long-overdue dignity of adequate funding for treatment of this deadly disease.The culture of treating junkies like dispensable sub-humans is beginning to change. But not enough. Not nearly enough. Perhaps when we stop stigmatizing addicts, we’ll stop letting them die.From my professional and personal experience, I know that shame isn’t healed in silence. No recovery is possible under stigma’s deadly weight. I write to add my name to the long list of people affected by the opioid epidemic. To attest to the fact that my brave, kind-hearted daughter is no less kind-hearted because she used heroin. I write to say that I’m proud of her, proud of her courage to choose recovery — a mountainous road steeper than anything most of us will ever have to climb. I write to break through the stigma in the culture and in myself. In my small way, I write to reclaim the voices of those silenced by the shame of heroin addiction.You Too?If you have a story about addiction and stigma, please contact me through my website so that I can bring your story to light in future blogs: www.miriamgreenspan.com"

It also voted to make it easier for media companies to buy additional TV stations in the same market, and for local stations to jointly sell advertising time and for companies to buy additional radio stations in some markets.Big media companies including Tegna Inc , CBS Corp  and Nexstar Media Group Inc  have cited the expected rule change as motivation for considering expansion opportunities.“This is really about helping large media companies grow even bigger,” said Democratic FCCCommissioner Mignon Clyburn, adding that Republicans were “more intent on granting the industry’s holiday wish list early rather than looking out for the public interest.”FCC Chairman Ajit Pai defended the rule change, saying it was “utter nonsense” that rules banning cross ownership of a newspaper and broadcast station were still in place after massive changes in media over the last four decades.The decision could also allow Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc , which is seeking approval for its proposed $3.9 billion acquisition of Tribune Media Co , to avoid some divestitures in order to gain approval of the deal.A federal appeals court, which has been grappling with the FCC’s media ownership rules for more than a decade, is expected to hear challenges to the new rules.U.S. Senator Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat, said the vote “will pave the wave for massive broadcast conglomerates to increasingly provide local viewers with nationalized cookie-cutter news and corporate propaganda that’s produced elsewhere.”But the National Association of Broadcasters said the rules were “not only irrational in today’s media environment, but they have also weakened the newspaper industry, cost journalism jobs and forced local broadcast stations onto unequal footing with our national pay-TV and radio competitors.”Pai is also expected to call for an initial vote in December to rescind rules prohibiting one company from owning stations that serve more than 39 percent of U.S. television households, Reuters reported on Wednesday, citing two people briefed on the matter.In April, the FCC voted to reverse a 2016 decision that limits the number of television stations some broadcasters could buy.(Reporting by David Shepardson in Washington; Editing by Matthew Lewis)"

Weeks after the storm hit, infrastructure in the island is still in such bad shape that less than 20 percent of people have electricity and 64 percent don’t have clean drinking water.The terrible conditions in the aftermath of the storm and the inappropriate response by government relief agencies have forced many to leave the island and relocate to Florida. This may lead to what many are speculating is a demographic and electoral shift in the state. In Orange County alone, an average of 104 people every workday are transferring their driver’s licenses from Puerto Rico to Florida and the Tax Collector’s office reported that in a recent six-month period, there have been 12,265 license transfers.Although Hurricane Maria has sped up the arrivals of people from the island to Florida, this is hardly a new development. More than 80,000 Puerto Ricans have relocated to the state every year in the last two years, a number that increased in the last few years due to the financial crisis that has besieged the island. More than a million Puerto Ricans call the state of Florida home, making up five percent of the population.Since Hurricane Maria, about 139,000 Puerto Ricans have relocated to the state. To put that in perspective, a Twitter user pointed out that the Mariel boat lift in 1980 brought 125,000 Cubans, significantly changing the make-up of Miami. We might be seeing something similar happening right before our eyes.This is all even more significant considering that, even though they might not be treated as such by our government, Puerto Ricans are American citizens and therefore can vote. Already there are efforts underway in central Florida to begin registering people to vote, and both parties have been busy courting the new influx of potential voters.More importantly though, Puerto Rico needs help. Food, electricity, clean water, clean up and the restoration of its infrastructure in the island. The folks settling in Florida will surely pay attention to how elected officials respond to the needs of their community both here in the state, but also back on the island.The actions of Donald Trump will also surely be a drag on potential Republican Puerto Rican voters. His response in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria was nothing short of atrocious, with a full six days passing before acknowledging the crisis. Then he quickly started a feud with the mayor of San Juan, calling her an “ingrate” on Twitter and saying that local leaders “were not able to get their workers to help. They want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort.”Trump eventually flew to Puerto Rico, where he spent his time shifting his attention between the woes of Puerto Rico’s residents and the issue of NFL players protesting police brutality, joking that Hurricane Maria was not a “real catastrophe” in comparison to Hurricane Katrina, and complaining that the impact of the hurricane had thrown the federal budget “a little out of whack.”In what has now become an infamous moment, Trump threw paper towel rolls at people waiting to receive relief supplies, a move that many considered insensitive.Puerto Ricans relocating to Florida have the potential to change the electoral landscape in the state, and they will surely remember how elected officials treated them and their community in their time of need and vulnerability.Thomas Kennedy is a communications fellow for the Center for Community Change."

Healthcare is a big issue in the United States, where President Donald Trump has vowed to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, introduced by his predecessor, Barack Obama, which aimed to make it easier for lower-income households to get health insurance.The pope said “the state cannot renounce its duty to protect all those involved, defending the fundamental equality whereby everyone is recognized under law as a human being living with others in society”.He said healthcare legislation needed a “broad vision and a comprehensive view of what most effectively promotes the common good in each concrete situation.”Reporting by Philip Pullella; Editing by Robin Pomeroy"
39,POLITICS,Republicans Face Some Last-Minute Doubts On Tax Proposal,Matt Fuller and Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-tax-last-minute-doubts_us_5a0cca9de4b0b17e5e13d56a,"They'll probably still pass the bill, but they're having a good sweat.",2017-11-16,House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) spent time Wednesday talking to Republicans who have lingering concerns about the state and local tax deduction changes in the tax bill.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0ccb301800004600f6c6b2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― House Republicans certainly look like they’re headed toward passing their tax proposal on Thursday, but last-minute concerns from some conservatives over the messaging of the tax bill is suddenly making leadership sweat.On Wednesday night, conservatives circled up with Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) on the House floor to discuss a key GOP talking point that conservatives don’t buy: that the average family of four will save $1,182 on their taxes.Conservatives including Reps. Thomas Massie (Ky.), Raul Labrador (Idaho), Scott Perry (Pa.), Justin Amash (Mich.) and Jim Jordan (Ohio) all huddled with Scalise and an aide to discuss the flaws in that calculation, with a number of conservatives suddenly concerned they might be “over-promising and under-delivering,” according to a member involved in the discussion.Leadership still seems to think those Republicans will come around. This is, after all, an argument over how much taxes are getting cut ― and these conservatives have long expressed support for cutting taxes.But the conversation has leaders double-checking their whip counts and perhaps building a new cushion for the tax bill. One advantage leadership has on this proposal is they control when they close the vote. If they really needed votes, they almost certainly could pressure some Republicans into supporting the bill, perhaps even offer some sweeteners to get the bill over the passage threshold.This sudden uncertainty, however, is coming as a bit of a surprise. Leaders have looked in command for weeks on this tax proposal, with an informal whip count composed by HuffPost showing only about 10 hard no votes on the bill. Republicans can theoretically lose 22 of their members and still pass the bill in the House, depending on how many members vote and if every Democrat votes no, as expected.But there are still a number of members leaning toward voting no and a number of other Republicans who still report being undecided as of Wednesday night.“I don’t even tell my wife,” Rep. Paul Cook (R-Calif.) told HuffPost on Wednesday night, when asked where he stood on the bill. (Cook said he was leaning one way, but he wouldn’t tell us in which direction.)Chief Deputy Whip Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) was working the floor feverishly during two vote series Wednesday, talking to a number of Republicans who hardly anyone has expected to vote no, including Jody Hice (Ga.), Andy Harris (Md.), Charlie Dent (Pa.), and Scott Perry (Pa.).Later in the day, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) spent a good amount of time on the floor with Barbara Comstock (R-Va.) and Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.), two Republicans who have lingering concerns about the state and local tax deduction even after leaders allowed filers to write off the first $10,000 of their local taxes.And Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) spent time working some California Republicans, most notably Tom McClintock and Steve Knight.Members and aides familiar with the leadership whip count still say they are confident, but a vote that was looking very easy earlier in the day is now being complicated by conservatives.The problem with leadership’s messaging about who would benefit from tax reform perfectly encapsulates the political difficulty of the GOP’s tax reform agenda ― a difficulty that flows directly from the policy itself. The most important feature of the Republican tax reform bill is a giant reduction in corporate and individual tax rates that would lose trillions of dollars of revenue. But another goal of the proposal is to simplify the tax code. In “simplifying” the tax code, Republicans are actually just nearly doubling the standard deduction and eliminating a slew of deductions that might actually end up raising taxes on some families.Certainly, if you’re from a high-tax state, such as New Jersey, New York or California, the ability to deduct your state and local taxes is a huge benefit. This is why most of the hard noes on this bill are coming from New Jersey and New York.The California Republicans seem to be counting on their individual districts not benefiting so much from the state and local tax deductions, which gives them license to vote yes. But, as conservatives pointed out Wednesday night, once you account for the money raised by eliminating other deductions, a relatively small amount of the cost of this bill flows to the individual side. The plan raises more than $2 trillion by eliminating deductions for state and local taxes and the personal exemption, which every household uses to reduce big chunks of taxable income.Conservatives are looking at the numbers and failing to see how leadership gets anything close to an average cut of $1,182 ― and they’re uncomfortable with Republicans touting that number if the cuts are actually much smaller.“There’s going to be a lot of disappointed people when they look at their tax bill,” one GOP member involved in discussions told HuffPost. “They’re going to think they got screwed.”Again, these members may still end up voting for the bill. In fact, based on conversations with some of these conservatives, we’re putting most in an undecided category even though we think they’ll end up supporting the bill. But these concerns, coupled with some holdouts, like a few members from the Pennsylvania delegation, are putting leadership closer to a floor defeat than they ever imagined.Here’s the HuffPost whip list of Republicans in the House. This list is based on conversations with members and aides but is not an official count and is fluid. Not every lawmaker on this list has confirmed how he or she will vote ― this is our best guess:NoDan Donovan (N.Y.)John Faso (N.Y.)Rodney Frelinghuysen (N.J.)Darrell Issa (Calif.)Peter King (N.Y.)Leonard Lance (N.J.)Frank LoBiondo (N.J.)Chris Smith (N.J.)Elise Stefanik (N.Y.)Lee Zeldin (N.Y.)Lean NoKen Buck (Colo.)Barbara Comstock (Va.)Walter Jones (N.C.)Tom McClintock (Calif.)Mark Sanford (S.C.)UndecidedJustin Amash (Mich.)Mark Amodei (Nev.)Ryan Costello (Pa.)Charlie Dent (Pa.)Brian Fitzpatrick (Pa.)Jody Hice (Ga.)Raul Labrador (Idaho)Thomas Massie (Ky.)Pat Meehan (Pa.)Scott Perry (Pa.)Lean YesAndy Biggs (Ariz.)Paul Cook (Calif.)Warren Davidson (Ohio)Tom Emmer (Minn.)Andy Harris (Md.)Randy Hultgren (Ill.)Duncan Hunter (Calif.)Jim Jordan (Ohio)John Katko (N.Y.)Steve Knight (Calif.)Dana Rohrabacher (Calif.)Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (Fla.)Ed Royce (Calif.)Claudia Tenney (N.Y.)Mimi Walters (Calif.)All Democrats in the House are expected to vote no."
40,WOMEN,The Life-Changing Magic Of Being Believed About Rape,Emily McCombs,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/being-believed-rape-lying_us_5a0c855fe4b0bc648a0f8444,"Because we can't all be lying, can we?",2017-11-16,"I appeared on ""The Dr. Phil Show"" to discuss my sexual assault. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0c89b71c0000e62eb34f0f.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"To be a woman who is open about sexual assault is to be well acquainted with disbelief.I have been writing about my rape ― at the hands of a group of adolescent boys when I was 14 ― online since at least 2011. In doing so, I have made myself vulnerable to what often felt like a tidal wave of scrutiny from those inclined to disbelieve women who say they were raped. Commenters dissected my appearance in author photos, whether my “provocative poses” and tattoos indicated that I had likely been a “willing participant to at least some degree.” People approached my essays like hard-boiled NYPD detectives, combing the narrative for clues and discrepancies that proved I was lying. Did this detail seem odd? Had I contradicted myself here? Wouldn’t a “real” rape victim have done this or that? Some pointed to my presumed drug or alcohol use as a complicating factor, like the commenter who wrote, “This isn’t really a case of ‘man attacks random woman on the street, rapes her and leaves.’ This is more of a ‘girl is drunk with a bunch of men she KNOWS and says “no stop” but they don’t listen.’” As if that isn’t the actual definition of rape. When I did radio and television appearances, viewers and listeners questioned the tone of my voice or my body language. “The tone of Emily’s telling of her experience just feels so ... I don’t know ... lacking in magnitude to me,” one commenter critiqued. A major sticking point in an NPR comments thread was whether the fact that I had laughed during my segment meant I hadn’t really been raped. The game, it quickly became evident, was rigged. Being a believable victim ― sober, virginal and having comported yourself perfectly before, during and after the greatest trauma of your life ― was an unattainable goal. Ultimately, the sentiment toward my story could be boiled down to a comment left on a Daily Mail story covering one of my essays about rape that read simply: “How do you know he raped her? Just because she said so?” While I knew on some level that being so public on the Internet about my rape functioned something like a Biore pore strip that sucks the worst scum to the surface, it also revealed something about society’s underlying attitudes toward women and sexual assault. It had been true when I was 14 and deciding to tell no one what had happened to me, and it was true now that I was 28 and speaking out: I could not expect to be believed about rape.For many women who have experienced sexual assault, watching the fallout of the past few post-Weinstein weeks has been triggering, overwhelming, and anxiety-inducing. But a small piece of magic to come out of these horrifying weeks, for me, has been watching women be believed about sexual assault. Recently, the mainstream narrative directed at the steady stream of women who have come forward about sexual assaults by powerful men has not been mockery. A critical mass of victims has partially taken the focus off the victims themselves. Fewer are being mercilessly questioned, having their characters torn apart, their outfits dissected. The default seems to be flip-flopping, and for the first time that I can remember, women’s accusations are being granted an innate credibility.For me, this has felt like the lifting of a heavy anvil of grief, both in the relief of its weightlessness and in the slight phantom pain it leaves in its absence.The factors behind our sudden willingness to believe are not entirely pure. There is the fact of who the women speaking out are ― wealthy, young, for the most part white, and “respectable” in the way that “good” victims are so often required to be. As Rebecca Traister, among others, points out in her powerful essay on the post-Weinstein era, “Racism and class discrimination determine whose stories get picked up and which women are readily believed.” The institutions doing the telling also seem to play a role in our willingness to believe ― the same men who haven’t always seemed to be listening to the voices of individual women are suddenly listening to The New York Times and The Washington Post. There is something that galls about that, like the feeling when a man in a meeting repeats your idea and everyone pays more attention to his voice.But. Still. For those of us girls who have been shouting ourselves hoarse about rape for decades, for those of us whose characters were dragged through the mud at the same time we were accused of having something to gain by lying, for those of us who heard the same sick, tired narratives so long we started to internalize them, wondering why didn’t we fight harder and why did we lead him on like that ― for us, experiencing a cultural moment in which women are believed about rape feels like some kind of goddamn magic trick.  One of those pieces that I did in my years of writing about my sexual assault involved speaking with one of the men who assaulted me. I actually called him up on the phone and talked to him about the details of my assault, those same details that had been subject to so much scrutiny. It was a crazy thing to do, and he could have denied everything, but luckily for my mental health, he didn’t. Instead, he said something to me that turned out to be an absolute gift: “You’re not crazy. I was there. I remember. It happened.” In verifying my memories, he restored something in me that had been eroded by doubt. He reminded me that I was telling the truth, that I was to be believed.  My hope is that this moment is more than just a moment, that once the truth has been revealed it cannot be unseen. And that just as the “me too” movement grew to encompass nearly every woman in this world in its scope, a movement to trust and believe women will spread. To her. And her too. And her, too. Because we can’t all be lying, can we?"
41,POLITICS,"Ignore Trump's Tweets? The World Wonders How That Works, Exactly.",S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-tweets-john-kelly_us_5a0cc04be4b0c0b2f2f78fb5,Critics call the White House chief of staff’s strategy unreasonable.,2017-11-16,White House Chief of Staff John Kelly said that he doesn't follow the president's tweets.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0cc18f1500002000858479.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― With President Donald Trump back tweeting from the White House and his chief of staff’s advice to the world about ignoring those tweets still fresh, the world has a simple question: How, exactly?Retired Marine Gen. John Kelly told reporters near the end of Trump’s 12-day Asia trip that he doesn’t read his boss’s tweets and neither does his staff.“We don’t. I don’t. I don’t allow the staff to. We know what we’re doing,” he said. “Believe it or not, I do not follow the tweets.”But while some in the foreign policy community understand why Kelly might want to pay no attention to Trump’s Twitter voice, they argue it just cannot be done.“There is no way that Trump’s tweets are insignificant,” said Eliot Cohen, a former top State Department official under President George W. Bush. “There is a measure of wishful thinking here, particularly by those around him who try to corral Trump.”Adam Thomson, a former British representative to NATO, said European leaders have been trying to do exactly as Kelly suggested for months now, with some minor success.“As their experience of President Trump grows, European governments have learned to tune out the tweeting detail and concentrate on what Trump’s utterances reveal about his general underlying instincts,” Thomson said.Western European nations also have multiple communications channels with the United States, through both public and private entities. That is not the case, warned a former top Pentagon official, with the nuclear-armed country posing perhaps the most dangerous foreign policy challenge today: North Korea.“The statements the president makes through his Twitter account no doubt cause concern and confusion on the other side of the Pacific. They don’t have a constellation of satellites to see where we are moving our forces,” Brian McKeon, a former undersecretary of defense under President Barack Obama, said at a Senate committee hearing on Tuesday.“And people may say, well, what he says on his Twitter account doesn’t matter, we have policies, we have leadership of the national command authority,” McKeon said. “That doesn’t compute in Kim Jong Un’s mind that what the president says doesn’t matter. So I would be very worried about a miscalculation based on continuing use of his Twitter account with regard to North Korea.”Kelly’s comments, in fact, came shortly after Trump called Kim “short and fat” on Twitter. It was among a string of angry messages the president posted from Vietnam not long before he was to depart for the Philippines, the final stop on the Asia trip. In addition to Kim, Trump also attacked former Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton, the “Fake News Media,” and those who criticize his cozy relationship with Russian leader Vladimir Putin.Kelly emphasized that regardless of what Trump chooses to tweet, his White House and National Security Council staff are the ones who research and implement his actual policies on global affairs.“The tweets don’t run my life. Good staff work runs it,” Kelly said, according to the Los Angeles Times report about his remarks. “We develop policy in the normal traditional staff way.”The Trump administration generally has been conflicted about the significance of the president’s 140-character communiqués since he took office in January. Then-press secretary Sean Spicer, when asked to clarify the difference between messages on Trump’s Twitter account and what Spicer himself said in press briefings, snapped at the questioner.“You’re equating me addressing the nation with a tweet?” Spicer said. “That’s the silliest thing I’ve ever heard.”But later ― perhaps chastised by a boss who believes his Twitter practice is a key to his success ― the press secretary backtracked. “The president is president of the United States. So they are considered official statements by the president of the United States,” Spicer said about the tweets.Executive branch agencies have been similarly caught off guard. Trump in July declared that the military would no longer permit transgender service members. The Defense Department’s reaction: “What you saw in the form of a tweet was representative of an announcement. That doesn’t result in any immediate policy changes for us. We will await formal direction,” said Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman.(A formal executive order on transgender troops was later issued. It is now tied up in court.)To some degree, the rest of the world has been ignoring many of Trump’s more incendiary remarks for months. Norway’s then-defense minister, Ine Eriksen Søreide, said during a visit to Washington this spring that she and other NATO leaders had come to accept assurances from Defense Secretary Jim Mattis that the United States was committed to the decades-old alliance, notwithstanding Trump’s statements.Mattis has “jokingly sometimes referred to himself as the secretary of reassurance,” said Eriksen Søreide, who is now Norway’s foreign minister.But Thomson said there are limits to ignoring Trump.“What he says doesn’t foreshadow or even shape the detail of administration policy but has accurately heralded significant setbacks in European eyes,” he said. “For example, on the Iran nuclear deal, the Paris climate accord and trade policy. Not exactly a reliable guide, but less obscure than the Delphi Oracle and more than random noise.”And in the United States, Trump’s tweets are clearly presidential utterances and treated as such, said Ned Price, a former CIA analyst and a National Security Council spokesman under Obama.“It’s convenient for the chief of staff to say the tweets are immaterial, but we’ve learned in recent months that the executive and legislative branches view them as communicating presidential intent and conveying presidential orders,” Price said. “We saw this in the case of the Muslim ban, when the 9th Circuit cited the tweets, and the White House itself also pointed to a tweet when responding to litigation regarding Trump’s false claim that he was spied upon by the Obama administration.”Cohen added that it makes no sense to ignore a president’s words. “The main thing is this: Policy is, if you think about it, nothing but words,” he said. “And the most powerful man in the world’s words matter.”"

Bob Menendez (D-N.J.).U.S. District Judge William Walls in Newark, New Jersey, declared the mistrial after a jury remained deadlocked after several days of deliberation. “We cannot reach a unanimous decision,” jurors wrote Thursday in a note to Walls, according to The Washington Post. “Nor are we willing to move away from our strong convictions.”Prosecutors can attempt to retry the case. Menendez was indicted earlier this year on 14 charges, including public corruption. He was accused of accepting gifts and donations from Dr. Salomon Melgen, a Florida ophthalmologist, in exchange for helping the doctor challenge Medicare reimbursement charges.The senator has denied any wrongdoing. His defense team argued that the gifts were tokens of friendship between two longtime companions, not bribes. They said the two men referred to each other as “hermano,” the Spanish word for brother. They also disputed that there was evidence that linked the gifts and actions allegedly taken on Melgen’s behalf.Speaking outside the courthouse following the judge’s announcement, Menendez criticized federal prosecutors and thanked the jury “who saw through the government’s false claims.”Menendez, who was first elected to the Senate in 2006, is up for re-election in November 2018. Following the announcement of the mistrial, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) called on the Senate Ethics Committee to investigate the case. “Senator Menendez was indicted on numerous federal felonies. He is one of only twelve U.S. Senators to have been indicted in our history,” McConnell said in a statement. “His trial shed light on serious accusations of violating the public’s trust as an elected official, as well as potential violations of the Senate’s Code of Conduct.”This story has been updated to include comment from Menendez and McConnell."

Pai now plans to hold a final vote on the proposal at the FCC’s Dec. 14 meeting, the people said, and roll out details of the plans next week.Pai asked in May for public comment on whether the FCC has authority or should keep any regulations limiting internet providers’ ability to block, throttle or offer “fast lanes” to some websites, known as “paid prioritization.” Several industry officials told Reuters they expect Pai to drop those specific legal requirements but retain some transparency requirements under the order.An FCC spokesman declined to comment.Internet providers including AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc say ending the rules could spark billions in additional broadband investment and eliminate the possibility a future administration could regulate internet pricing.Critics say the move could harm consumers, small businesses and access to the internet.In July, a group representing major technology firms including Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc urged Pai to drop plans to rescind the rules.Advocacy group Free Press said Wednesday “we’ll learn the gory details in the next few days, but we know that Pai intends to dismantle the basic protections that have fueled the internet’s growth.”Pai, who argues the Obama order was unnecessary and harms jobs and investment, has not committed to retaining any rules, but said he favors an “open internet.” The proposal to reverse the Obama rules reclassifying internet service has drawn more than 22 million comments.Pai is mounting an aggressive deregulatory agenda since being named by President Donald Trump to head the FCC.On Thursday the FCC will vote on Pai’s proposal to eliminate the 42-year-old ban on cross-ownership of a newspaper and TV station in a major market. The proposal would make it easier for media companies to buy additional TV stations in the same market.Pai is also expected to call for an initial vote in December to rescind rules that say one company may not own stations serving more than 39 percent of U.S. television households, two people briefed on the matter said.(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Chris Reese)"

46,POLITICS,House Republicans Pass Tax Bill,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/house-passes-tax-reform_us_5a0dd657e4b0c0b2f2f8afe9,No one seemed to care that the bill isn't particularly popular.,2017-11-16,Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) led Republicans in passing their tax plan Thursday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0dd6ed15000046008586dc.jpeg?ops=crop_21_14_3554_2049%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― After months of internal squabbling and doubts, House Republicans passed their tax proposal on Thursday, a major step forward for a House GOP that has thus far been unable to deliver on any major piece of President Donald Trump’s agenda.The House passed the bill 227-205, with 13 Republicans joining every Democrat in opposing the measure, which would lower individual tax brackets, dramatically cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent, and nearly double the standard deduction while eliminating a slew of smaller write-offs.But even as Republicans celebrated the passage of their tax plan, the public perception of the bill is less than stellar. According to the most recent polling, only 30 percent of Americans support the GOP tax plan, with 40 percent opposing the bill and another 30 percent unsure. Most Americans believe they won’t see a tax cut from the GOP tax plan. In fact, only about 25 percent of Republicans believe they will pay less as a result of the measure, while 47 percent of Americans believe Trump will pay less.Trump came to the Capitol on Thursday to rally Republicans and implore them to vote yes (and, apparently, give a maundering speech about his trip to Asia). But his whip efforts, late and unnecessary, didn’t seem to do much to move members. The same Republicans who have appeared doubtful from the beginning over concerns about eliminating the state and local tax deduction ― mostly Republicans from high-tax states such as New Jersey and New York ― ended up voting against the bill.After a small mutiny in the House as leadership was releasing the bill in October, Republicans did adjust the legislation to allow filers to write off the first $10,000 of their property taxes. But for the Republicans who voted no, even that adjustment might still result in a significant number of their constituents facing a tax increase.Of the 13 Republicans who voted no, five come from New York, four come from New Jersey, three from California, and one, Rep. Walter Jones Jr., comes from North Carolina. (Jones was concerned about adding to the debt.)The other Republicans who voted no are: Reps. Dan Donovan (N.Y.), John Faso (N.Y.), Darrell Issa (Calif.), Peter King (N.Y.), Leonard Lance (N.J.), Frank LoBiondo (N.J.), Tom McClintock (Calif.), Dana Rohrabacher (Calif.), Chris Smith (N.J.), Elise Stefanik (N.Y.), Lee Zeldin (N.Y.) and Rodney Frelinghuysen (N.J.), who chairs the Appropriations Committee.California Republicans, many of whom serve highly taxed areas, mostly got onboard with the GOP tax plan, a trend that has played out repeatedly on two other budget votes setting up the reconciliation bill. (Republicans are using the budget reconciliation process to pass the tax bill so they can sidestep the 60-vote threshold in the Senate and pass the legislation with a simple majority.)The Senate is still a significant hurdle for Republicans. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) has come out against the Senate version of the bill, and Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) also seems unlikely to vote for the bill if, as expected, it includes a repeal of the individual mandate for Obamacare. The GOP can currently afford to lose only two Republicans on their measure, with Vice President Mike Pence breaking a tie to push the bill over the finish line, but there are a number of other Republicans who have concerns about the bill, particularly a somewhat restrictive 25 percent pass-through rate for S corporations and the mandate repeal.The Senate math is also complicated by an Alabama Senate special election. Democrat Doug Jones is polling ahead of Republican Roy Moore after numerous allegations have come out that Moore dated ― as well as sexually assaulted ― teenage girls when he was in his 30s. A Jones victory would mean Republicans could lose only one vote and still pass the bill.The Senate is aiming to pass the bill before the Dec. 12 special election, with the intention of making the Alabama race meaningless for tax reform, but ― the Senate being the Senate ― delays are more than possible.On the House side, GOP lawmakers seem to have gone along with this tax bill despite some reservations because they feel the need to have something to point to next year when it comes time for re-election. Conservatives were concerned about debt, as the bill would allow Republicans to increase debt by $1.5 trillion over 10 years in the name of tax cuts. Republicans from those highly taxed “blue states” were concerned some of their constituents would face tax increases, or at least not as big of a tax cut as voters in other states. And a number of other Republicans had individual concerns with a such an expansive tax code rewrite that has drawn major opposition from home builders, real estate agents and small businesses.But conservatives ultimately sided with arguments that tax cuts don’t need to be paid for. Leadership was able to split the votes from Republicans adversely affected by the state and local deduction changes. And other Republicans with more specific concerns fell in line.Democrats criticized their GOP colleagues for selling this tax plan as a middle-class tax cut when 47 percent of the tax benefits, according to a study by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, would go to the richest 1 percent.On the House floor, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called the argument of “trickle-down” economics “BS.” Republicans groaned.The passage of the House bill is a significant moment in the tenure of Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). The former Ways and Means chairman has long sought to rewrite the tax code ― he claimed on Thursday that this is a “generational defining moment” ― and Ryan portrayed the GOP’s tax bill as a necessary step to ignite the economy.“It’s about tax relief. It’s about fairness. It’s about simplicity. It’s about easing the stress and anxiety in this country,” Ryan said.Arthur Delaney contributed to this report.

Karen Bass (D-Calif.) questioned Attorney General Jeff Sessions about the FBI intelligence report titled “Black Identity Extremists Likely Motivated to Target Law Enforcement Officers” during a hearing Tuesday. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0ce8071800004600f6c6e6.jpeg?cache=4VlWrn2L5h&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Attorney General Jeff Sessions declined to say this week whether he believes the Black Lives Matter movement is a “black identity extremist” group, a term used in a recently disclosed FBI report that claims such organizations would use “perceptions” of police brutality against African-Americans to justify violent attacks on officers.But the member of Congress who pressed the nation’s top law enforcement official about the controversial FBI report, which was revealed by Foreign Policy last month, told HuffPost that the bureau needs to disown the report and “throw it in the trash can,” saying it makes racist generalizations about police brutality protesters.“It is extremely important that we make it very public so we can stop it,” Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.) said in an interview.Bass questioned Sessions about the FBI intelligence report titled “Black Identity Extremists Likely Motivated to Target Law Enforcement Officers” during a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Tuesday. The Aug. 3 report stated that it was “very likely” that “perceptions of unjust treatment of African Americans and the perceived unchallenged illegitimate actions of law enforcement will inspire premeditated attacks against law enforcement over the next year.”Under Bass’s questioning, Sessions said that he knew of African-American groups that had “an extraordinary commitment to their racial identity,” some of which had “transformed themselves... into violent activists.” Sessions said he hadn’t read the FBI report but would be interested in reading it. He said the FBI usually does an “excellent job” on the reports, which he said were typically “objective and fair.” Sessions said the Justice Department “would not unlawfully target people.”The FBI’s report never explicitly mentioned the Black Lives Matter movement. Asked if he’d consider the Black Lives Matter movement a “black identity extremist” group, Sessions demurred: “I’m not able to comment on that. I have not so declared it.” Bass told HuffPost she believed Sessions was “trying to be evasive” in his answers and found it revealing that he couldn’t specifically name any modern black organization responsible for the deaths of police officers. She’s said she’s concerned that the actions of any African-American can be used to smear an entire movement. “I think it’s just the racism, frankly, not because they’re loosely organized or anything like that. I think that what has happened in our country a lot is that if an African-American commits a crime, then the entire group is responsible,” Bass said. “Black people’s general response to a crime is ‘Was it a black person who did it?’ Because we know if there was a black person who did it, then everyone is responsible and accountable.”Sessions did reference a “certain group” that was responsible for the deaths of police officers. “I believe we had within the last year or so four police officers killed by a group that some have described as extremists,” Sessions said.Sessions was apparently referencing the murder of five Dallas police officers in July 2016 by Micah Xavier Johnson, who had been banned from becoming a member of several black power groups. Asked about the attorney general’s comments, a Justice Department official pointed HuffPost to stories on the shooter’s claims of affiliation with the Huey P. Newton Gun Club, including a story in which the co-founder of the group said the shooter’s actions would be celebrated one day. The FBI declined to comment on the intelligence report in particular. But in a statement, it said it would not initiate an investigation based only on a person’s race, ethnicity, national origin, religion or the exercise of their First Amendment rights. “Our focus is not on membership in particular groups but on individuals who commit violence and other criminal acts,” the statement said. “Furthermore, the FBI does not and will not police ideology. When an individual takes violent action based on belief or ideology and breaks the law, the FBI will enforce the rule of law.”Black members of Congress have pressed the FBI for answers on the report in recent weeks and were working to set up a meeting with FBI Director Chris Wray.The FBI intelligence report, as published by Foreign Policy, follows:Ryan Reilly is HuffPost’s senior justice reporter, covering criminal justice, federal law enforcement and legal affairs.

The 2017 campaign lawn signs haven’t come down yet, but",2017-11-16,<p>A photo from the People's Climate March in 2014.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0da15415000025008585f7.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It’s hard to believe, but the 2018 election cycle is already here.The 2017 campaign lawn signs haven’t come down yet, but pundits are already calling the November 7th results a harbinger of Democratic victories to come in 2018. They may be right, but if we’re going to get serious about the deepening climate crisis, the more important question is: Will 2018 be the year that politicians (and voters) finally begin to focus on climate change?Early signs indicate that they will. Leading up to last week’s election, the Environmental Voter Project called, visited, and texted over 250,000 environmentalists in five key states: Pennsylvania, Florida, Colorado, Georgia, and Massachusetts. We also had, unsolicited, more than 1,000 people contact our non-profit to volunteer for get-out-the-vote efforts – far surpassing any prior numbers. It’s clear from these conversations with volunteers and voters that environmentalists are now highly motivated.That’s good, because climate voters are needed now more than ever.After record seasons for hurricanes, wildfires, heat waves, and flooding, the impacts of climate change have never been more apparent, yet President Trump seems determined to make matters worse by gutting the Clean Power Plan, withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, and slashing the EPA’s budget. If 2018 is like previous elections though, most people who care deeply about climate change may not even show up to vote. According to Environmental Voter Project research, only 50 percent of environmentalists voted in the 2016 presidential election, compared to 69 percent among all registered voters. In the 2014 midterm elections, only 21 percent of environmentalists voted, compared to 44 percent among all registered voters. Low turnout poses an obvious problem in that it affects the outcome of close elections, but its true impact is far greater and longer lasting due to an often overlooked mainstay of modern politics: polls of “likely voters.” When environmentalists don’t vote, they aren’t considered “likely voters,” which means they won’t get called by pollsters. Consequently, environmental concerns have become under-represented in the electorate, leaving candidates, policymakers, and the media to focus on other issues. This was never more apparent than in the three 2016 presidential debates when climate change was discussed for a mere 5 minutes (and, even then, only because of a question from the audience).The good news is that all of this might be changing. Recent studies show that young people (ages 18-29) and Latinos are far more likely to care about climate change than any other demographic groups, and in 2017’s marquee election in Virginia, we saw surprising increases in voter turnout among these two groups. Latinos jumped from representing 4% of turnout in 2013 to 6% in 2017, and 18-29 year olds doubled their turnout rates over just eight years, from 17% in 2009 to 34% in 2017. These trends are certainly moving in a good direction for climate voters.We also saw climate activists win big victories up and down the ballot on November 7th. Local elections usually don’t mention climate change, but in 2017 the climate crisis was front and center in many important races. In Washington state, two crucially important swing-seats were won by candidates running on explicitly pro-environment platforms, despite the fossil fuel industry spending over a million dollars to defeat them. In the bellwether of St. Petersburg, FL, incumbent mayor Rick Kriseman narrowly defeated Rick Baker, largely by painting him as a climate denier. And voters across the country supported a host of climate-friendly ballot measures, including a $200 million climate bond measure in Miami, and a green roof initiative in Denver where opponents outspent supporters by a 12-to-1 margin.Large numbers of latent climate voters have always existed - with as many as 20 million registered voters listing environmental issues as one of their top priorities - but historically, few of them turn out on Election Day. Ironically, with the Trump administration explicitly denying the scientific consensus around climate change, the President may be accomplishing something the environmental movement has struggled to do for years -- convincing environmentalists of the importance of voting. We won’t know for sure until the ballots are counted, but it sure seems that we’ll be hearing from climate voters on November 6, 2018.Nathaniel Stinnett is the Founder & Executive Director of the Environmental Voter Project, a non-profit focused on increasing turnout among environmental voters in local, state, and federal elections."
49,POLITICS,"The Benghazi Terror Trial Is Coming To A Close, But You Probably Haven't Heard Much About It",Ryan J. Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/benghazi-trial-abu-khatallah_us_5a0daec5e4b0c0b2f2f84752,"Federal prosecutors argued Ahmed Abu Khatallah ""hates America,"" is ""guilty as sin"" and is a ""stone-cold terrorist.""",2017-11-16,Ahmed Abu Khatallah photographed after his capture. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0df81b1500004600858752.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Federal prosecutors here Thursday closed out their case against Ahmed Abu Khatallah, the alleged ringleader of the deadly 2012 terrorist attack on a U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans, including an ambassador.“The defendant is guilty as sin, and he is a stone-cold terrorist,” said federal prosecutor Julieanne Himelstein, in her rebuttal to the defense that would be the last thing the jury would hear before deliberations. Himelstein passionately described slain Ambassador Chris Stevens as “our son,” using the same term for the three others killed in the attack.Although the 2012 attack in Benghazi became a national focal point in the lead-up to Hillary Clinton’s campaign for president last year, the federal trial against Abu Khatallah has drawn little attention in recent weeks. The U.S. government captured Abu Khatallah in 2014, and he made his first court appearances under tight security. After his capture, some congressional Republicans said that Abu Khatallah should be sent to Guantanamo Bay. But unlike the slow, troubled military tribunals in Guantanamo, the federal trial against Abu Khatallah has moved along at a relatively steady pace. While placing a foreign terrorist on trial in a federal “civilian” court has been controversial since the beginning years of the Obama administration, the closing arguments in the Abu Khatallah trial felt pretty routine. The trial has unfolded at a federal courthouse near the Capitol with little, if any, disruption to the court’s everyday proceedings, even moving forward during the media circus surrounding former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort’s recent appearances in a separate case. Now in its seventh week, the trial has at times been pretty mundane. On Thursday, the judge called a break when he saw jurors “fidgeting” during the federal prosecutor’s long and winding closing argument.“Let’s try to bring it home, OK?” U.S. District Court Judge Christopher R. Cooper told federal prosecutor Michael DiLorenzo.DiLorenzo told jurors that the government had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Abu Khatallah was responsible for the deaths of Stevens, U.S. Foreign Service Officer Sean Smith, and CIA contractors Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty.“Ladies and gentlemen, he hates America, and that’s why he committed this attack,” DiLorenzo said. “He was there to attack the mission facilities. He was there to kill Americans.”Abu Khatallah, who has remained incarcerated since his arrest, sat in blue prison garb listening to the proceedings. His attorney, federal public defender Michelle Peterson, argued that federal prosecutors didn’t have the proof they needed and were instead trying to paint Abu Khatallah as someone jurors should despise.“They want you to hate him ― that’s what this case is about,” Peterson told jurors. “He doesn’t hate America; there’s no evidence of that.”Peterson said her client had been “clumped over the head,” hoisted up on a ship “like a slab of meat,” blindfolded and gagged when he was taken into custody. So perhaps there was a reason the comments that he made during an interrogation after his capture weren’t particularly sympathetic to the slain Americans, Peterson suggested. She said there’s no evidence that Abu Khatallah planned the attack.“He didn’t start the fire. He didn’t shoot the mortars. There’s no evidence that he was the mastermind behind anything,” she said. Peterson also told jurors that Abu Khatallah’s ideology isn’t relevant to whether he’s guilty. He might not have wanted Americans spying in his home country, she said, but there are plenty of Americans who don’t think Russia should be spying in the United States, for example. His religious beliefs also shouldn’t come into play, Peterson argued.“Shariah law is not equivalent to terrorism,” she said. “Wanting Shariah law in your own country is not a crime ... There’s no evidence he was trying to export Shariah law anywhere else; he was a Benghazi man through and through.”The witnesses against Abu Khatallah, Peterson argued, were motivated because they were given “bags of cash” by the government. The star witness against Abu Khatallah, who testified under a pseudonym, was paid $7 million by the U.S. government, and has since been relocated to Texas. He testified that, after gaining Abu Khatallah’s trust, the suspect told him he intended to kill “everybody” at the compound.The informant testified that at one time he suggested to the U.S. government that he kill Abu Khatallah himself. If he was willing to kill for the U.S. government, Peterson suggested, wouldn’t he be willing to lie for the U.S. government as well?She urged the jury to find reasonable doubt to convict Abu Khatallah, arguing there were plenty of reasons to doubt that he committed the crime. “We don’t have to prove anything. If there’s something missing, it’s not on us,” she said. She argued that Abu Khatallah simply went to the compound to see what was going on, and that he didn’t take part in the attack.Himelstein, the assistant U.S. attorney who offered the rebuttal to the defense team’s closing arguments, made an emotional appeal to the jurors. She described Stevens as a “beautiful humanitarian” who was beloved by Libyans.“How dare you?” Himelstein said at one point, in a comment apparently directed at Abu Khatallah. “How dare he?”The defense team objected to Himelstein’s statements at several points during her argument, and she was once asked to approach the bench after she made a comment that seemed to be directed at Abu Khatallah’s lawyer.Cooper told the jurors to come back on Monday morning to begin their deliberations.A few years ago, it would have been tough to imagine a quiet end to the Benghazi trial. Clinton was secretary of state at the time of the attack, and expressed regret that security wasn’t in place that could’ve prevented the deaths. Several intensive congressional investigations ran up bills in the millions, and investigators found no evidence of wrongdoing on Clinton’s part. Yet polls ahead of the election last year found that 90 percent of Donald Trump supporters believed that Clinton “definitely” or “possibly” was warned of the attack and did nothing to stop it.Benghazi was a major focus of the 2016 Republican National Convention, with organizers dedicating more than 30 minutes of stage time to the topic. As Erik Wemple wrote at The Washington Post last week, the Benghazi trial currently has minimal airtime at Fox News, which had closely covered the trial (and, more specifically, Clinton’s involvement) since the 2012 attack. Trump has complained about the slow process in federal courts, and floated the idea that the man arrested in a terrorist attack in New York last month be sent to Guantanamo, calling the federal judicial system a “joke” and a “laughingstock.” But he quickly reversed himself, tweeting that going through the Guantanamo system would be much slower than the federal court system. The 2012 attack on two U.S. facilities in Benghazi was carried out by members of the militant group Ansar al-Sharia. The attackers used guns and rocket-propelled grenades, and set fires. The government initially believed that the attack grew out of protests surrounding the release of an anti-Muslim film, though it later became clear that the attack was planned ahead of time.Ryan Reilly is HuffPost’s senior justice reporter, covering criminal justice, federal law enforcement and legal affairs.

50,WORLD NEWS,'Religious Freedom' Clauses Are Point Of Contention As Australia Crafts Marriage Equality Laws,Lydia O'Connor,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/australia-same-sex-marriage-religious-freedom_us_5a0c8e7fe4b0bc648a0f9c6f,"Australians voted in favor of legalizing same-sex marriage. Now,  their lawmakers must decide what that means.",2017-11-16,People in Melbourne celebrate the results of the national survey.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0cc8b11800003300f6c6a8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"While the fight to legalize same-sex marriage in Australia crossed a major hurdle Wednesday, the path to creating legislation is only just beginning. Australians overwhelmingly voted in favor of marriage equality, with 61.6 percent of those surveyed voting yes and 38.4 percent voting against it. The survey results were cause for massive celebration across Australia, one of the last major holdouts in the fight for marriage equality. But there won’t be any change to the nation’s marriage laws until Parliament finishes writing, debating and passing legislation.Although the survey results are nonbinding and Parliament theoretically doesn’t need to act on the survey results, they are moving forward with the process. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, leader of the right-leaning Liberal Party, said he’d like to see legislation passed by Christmas that overturns the 2004 declaration defining marriage as a union of “a man and a woman.”The future of same-sex marriage in Australia now hinges on the language in the new law ― which likely will include some concessions to conservative causes ― and how members of Parliament decide to vote. Turnbull has given lawmakers a “free” or “conscience” vote on the matter, meaning that once the legislation is finalized, they are free to base their votes on their own opinions. However, several lawmakers have indicated their votes will reflect either the overall national survey result or the results from the electorates they represent, Australian outlets have reported.The bill’s success may also hinge on the degree to which it makes allowances for Australians who morally object to same-sex marriage. The Senate has agreed to hear a bill from Liberal Party Senator Dean Smith, who wrote a provision allowing religious protections for ministers who object to officiating same-sex ceremonies. Labor and the Green party members have said they will support it, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported.A bill from Liberal Party Senator James Paterson included more concessions to the religious right and was favored by conservatives, but Paterson decided to drop it once it became clear it would not earn the support of Labor party voters. “It is clear the majority of senators believe my colleague Senator Dean Smith’s Bill is where we should start,” he wrote in a Facebook post.Patterson’s bill would have extended religious protections to any business owners who refuse to provide services for a same-sex wedding ceremony, including venue owners, event planners, photographers, florists, caterers and others in the industry. Those religious protection clauses may be enough to sway some of the lawmakers not to vote for the bill.Senator Matt Canavan told ABC News24 that while he supports his electorate’s desire to legalize same-sex marriage, he believes Smith’s bill inadequately protects religious freedom, and said he “won’t support a bill that diminishes fundamental human rights.” "

Bush of sexual assault ― this time while he was in office.A 55-year-old woman, who asked to remain unnamed, told CNN that at a re-election campaign fundraiser in Dearborn, Michigan, in April 1992, the then-67-year-old Bush grabbed her rear during a photo op.“We got closer together for a family photo and it was like, ‘Holy crap!’” she told CNN, describing the incident. “It was like a gentle squeeze.”She didn’t say anything at the time, but told her ex-husband and her best friend soon after, reports CNN. The woman chose to come forward now after seeing similar allegations by other women against Bush in recent weeks. “All the focus has been on ‘He’s old.’ OK, but he wasn’t old when it happened to me,” she added. The woman’s story echoes accusations made by at least seven other women since October who have said the former president groped them during photo ops from 2003 to 2016. One woman said she was 16 years old when a then-79-year-old Bush groped her butt during a photo op in 2003.This latest allegation is the first one said to have occurred while Bush was in office.Bush spokesman Jim McGrath declined to comment to HuffPost on this latest allegation.In response to the initial allegations regarding Bush, McGrath had issued the following statement.“At age 93, President Bush has been confined to a wheelchair for roughly five years, so his arm falls on the lower waist of people with whom he takes pictures,” McGrath wrote. “On occasion, he has patted women’s rears in what he intended to be a good-natured manner. Some have seen it as innocent; others clearly view it as inappropriate. To anyone he has offended, President Bush apologizes most sincerely.”CORRECTION: A previous version of this article identified the woman who spoke to CNN as the seventh woman to accuse George H.W. Bush of groping her. She was the eighth."

The retail giant was selling posters of Japanese-American incarceration during World War II on its website. Walmart took them down after author Jamie Ford tweeted the company asking why it was selling the posters and noting the offensive description of the products.One particular poster featured a child waiting to be taken to an incarceration camp, and was advertised as “the perfect wall art for any home, bedroom, playroom, classroom, dorm room or office workspace.” In addition to quickly removing the items, Walmart also apologized for its actions in a statement sent to HuffPost, and indicated it had communicated with nonprofit Japanese American Citizens League on the issue. “We are very sorry such a sensitive topic was handled in such an insensitive way. The description used for these products was beyond tone-deaf, and unfortunately it wasn’t caught by us or the marketplace seller who listed these products on our site,” a Walmart spokesperson wrote. “When we were contacted about these over the weekend, we quickly removed the items from our Marketplace. We apologize this wasn’t caught sooner.”Natasha Varner, communications and public engagement manager at Japanese-American nonprofit Densho, told HuffPost that though the removal of the products was a small victory, the incident “barely scratches the surface” of a larger issue. The sale of images from Japanese-American incarceration camps can be found on a variety of marketplaces including Amazon, among other sites. And just because it’s legal to sell these photos doesn’t mean they should. “The companies that sell these prints are legally able to do so since the images are in the public domain, but they should really be examining the ethics of profiting off of this grave historical injustice,” Varner said.She added that if companies wish to sell images, they should do so responsibly and link up with Japanese-American organizations to discuss which prints should be sold and how the photos should be described, along with the most ethical way to market them and who the proceeds benefit. To prevent similar incidents from happening in the future, Varner says it’s important to be aware of the context of these tragedies. “The bottom line is this: if you choose to sell prints of historical trauma or other sensitive issues, think about the communities those images represent,” she said. “Engage them. Make sure the proceeds benefit them. Give them the agency and respect they were denied at the time those photographs were taken.”"
54,POLITICS,Trump To Lift Ban On Import Of Elephant Trophies From 2 African Nations,Chris D'Angelo,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-lift-ban-elephant-trophies_us_5a0cb765e4b0c0b2f2f78878,The decision was made public by none other than the trophy hunting advocacy group that sued to block the Obama-era ban in 2014.,2017-11-16,"Trophy hunting ""can benefit the conservation of certain species,"" according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service statement. Here, trophy hunter David Barrett with one of his kills in 2009 in Zimbabwe.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0cf0031400004a0050dc54.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration will reverse an Obama-era ban on the importation of elephant trophies from Zimbabwe and Zambia after determining that sport hunting in those countries will help conserve the species, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service confirmed Wednesday. The decision was made public not by the federal agency but via a celebratory news release early Tuesday from Safari Club International, a trophy hunting advocacy group that, along with the National Rifle Association, sued to block the 2014 ban. Greg Sheehan, principal deputy director of the FWS, broke the news to the hunting organization during the African Wildlife Consultative Forum (AWCF) in Tanzania, an agency spokesperson told HuffPost. The forum, which runs through Friday, is being hosted by the Safari Club International Foundation and the United Republic of Tanzania. African elephants have been listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act since 1978. A provision of the law, however, allows for sport-hunted trophies to be imported if the government determines that hunting will help safeguard the population. An FWS spokesperson provided HuffPost with a pair of nearly identical statements regarding the agency’s findings for elephants in each country. “Legal, well-regulated sport hunting as part of a sound management program can benefit the conservation of certain species by providing incentives to local communities to conserve the species and by putting much-needed revenue back into conservation,” the spokesperson wrote. “The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that the hunting and management programs for African elephants in [Zimbabwe and Zambia] will enhance the survival of the species in the wild.”A notice — shared with HuffPost — regarding the agency’s decision on elephants in Zimbabwe will be published Friday in the Federal Register, the spokesperson said. “There now appears to be a greater effort on the part of [Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority] to work with NGOs, landowners, and safari area concessionaires to improve elephant management and anti-poaching efforts,” the notice reads.It is unclear when the agency’s decision to allow imports of trophies from Zambia will be posted. The findings allow for anyone who legally kills an elephant in Zimbabwe from Jan. 21, 2016, to Dec. 31, 2018, or in Zambia in 2016, 2017 and 2018 to obtain a permit to import their trophy into the United States, according to FWS.Paul Babaz, president of Safari Club International, applauded the announcement, saying it demonstrates FWS “recognizes that hunting is beneficial to wildlife and that these range countries know how to manage their elephant populations.” But the number of Savanna elephants continues to dwindle. From 2007 to 2014, the population dropped by 30 percent, or about 144,000 animals, across 18 African countries, according to the 2016 Great Elephant Census. In Zimbabwe, it fell 6 percent. And “substantial declines” have been recorded along the Zambezi River in Zambia, although the population elsewhere in the country remained stable. In a blog post Wednesday, Wayne Pacelle, president and CEO of The Humane Society of the United States, called the decision “jarring.” “For decades, Zimbabwe has been run by a dictator who has targeted and killed his political opponents, and operated the country’s wildlife management program as something of a live auction,” he wrote. (Zimbabwe’s president, Robert Mugabe, appears to be under house arrest now, though, after the military took charge of the country late Tuesday.)Pacelle added that the announcement coming from the Safari Club “suggests an uncomfortably cozy and even improper relationship between trophy hunting interests and the Department of the Interior.” The Interior Department is led by Secretary Ryan Zinke, an avid hunter who has moved to increase opportunities for hunting and fishing. Earlier this month, Zinke announced the creation of a so-called International Wildlife Conservation Council to advise him on “the benefits that international recreational hunting has on foreign wildlife and habitat conservation, anti-poaching and illegal wildlife trafficking programs.”President Donald Trump’s sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, are also avid big game hunters. In a photo that surfaced in 2012, Trump Jr. can be seen holding the tail of an elephant he shot and killed in Africa. "

He had no other events scheduled that day.During his Asia trip, Trump claimed that he had not been following the story closely because “I do not watch much television.”“I haven’t gotten to see too much. And believe it or not, even when I’m in Washington or New York, I do not watch much television. I know they like to say that. People that don’t know me, they like to say I watch television ― people with fake sources. You know, fake reporters, fake sources. But I don’t get to watch much television. Primarily because of documents. I’m reading documents. A lot. And different things,” he told reporters. “Honestly, I’d have to look at it, and I’d have to see, because, again, I’m dealing with the president of China, the president of Russia.”The only official comment from Trump came last Friday, when Sanders issued a statement saying that he “believes that we cannot allow a mere allegation ― in this case, one from many years ago ― to destroy a person’s life” but that if the allegations are true, “Judge Moore will do the right thing and step aside.”Since then, more and more Republican lawmakers, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and House Speaker Paul Ryan (Wis.), have called on Moore to leave the race and affirmed that they believe the allegations of the women.Late Tuesday, the Republican National Committee pulled its funding from Moore’s campaign. On Wednesday night, three more women came forward with misconduct allegations against Moore, with several accounts involving Moore preying on teenage girls at his local mall.A defiant Moore has continually denied the allegations, claiming they are a conspiracy against him and following a common Trump strategy of blaming the media.“Obviously I’ve made a few people mad. I’m the only one who can unite Democrats and Republicans because I seem to be opposed by both,” he said at a campaign event Tuesday night. “They’ve spent over $30 million to try to take me out, they’ve done everything they could, and now they’re together to try to keep me from going to Washington.”He added that he thinks he is “being harassed by the media.”Trump notably backed Moore’s special election primary opponent, GOP establishment candidate Sen. Luther Strange (R-Ala.), who was selected to temporarily fill the seat left vacant by Attorney General Jeff Sessions.However, many members of the president’s base, including former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, supported Moore.When Moore defeated Strange in September, Trump disavowed his endorsement of Strange, deleting tweets in support of him. Early the next morning, Trump called Moore “a really great guy” in a tweet affirming his support.During his presidential campaign, Trump dismissed allegations of sexual misconduct against himself from more than a dozen women and threatened to sue some of his accusers. Last fall, he claimed that a 2005 tape of him bragging about sexual assault was “locker room talk.”Yet Republicans still backed him.On Tuesday, when asked to square the hypocrisy of their denunciations of Moore and support of Trump last year, many GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill ignored HuffPost’s inquiries.Sanders would not explain the discrepancy when asked by reporters on Thursday.“I think the president has certainly a lot more insight into what he personally did or didn’t do, and he spoke out about that directly during the campaign,” she said. “I don’t have anything further to add beyond that.”This story has been updated with comments from White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Thursday afternoon."

Messenger of Peace Leonardo DiCaprio poses at a screening of his documentary ""Before the Flood"" at the United Nations in New York City in October 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0c84141f00003b004a5e44.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Leonardo DiCaprio transformed himself into the celebrity face of the movement to combat climate change, donating millions to conservation causes and starring in an Al Gore-style documentary last year.But the actor’s latest environmental effort takes a different approach, putting indigenous people out front. Amazon Frontlines, a new nonprofit funded by DiCaprio’s foundation, plans to launch Thursday with the aim of nurturing an alliance between tribes and trumpeting stories about their fights to stop timber and oil drilling in the South American rainforest.“Amazon Frontlines is the real deal,” Justin Winters, executive director of the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, told HuffPost by email. “This work is what urgent climate action at the community level is all about.” The group springs from an effort to provide clean water to tribes in the region whose water wells were contaminated from decades of drilling by oil giant Texaco. In 2011, Ecuador’s Supreme Court ruled that Chevron, which bought Texaco for $36 billion in 2000, owed $9.5 billion in compensation for dumping more than 18 billion gallons of crude in the once-pristine rainforest ― a slow-moving disaster dubbed “rainforest Chernobyl” by environmentalists.That same year, activists started a group called ClearWater to provide clean water to four indigenous tribes in Ecuador’s Amazon ― the Siona, Secoya, Waorani and Cofan. The tribes, with more than 1,000 families between them, united around the shared struggle. Now, that coalition has formed what’s called the Ceibo Alliance. Amazon Frontlines serves as its sister organization, focused on building water and solar energy infrastructure, documenting evidence of violations against the tribes’ sovereignty and advocating to make their fight public. “It’s been inspiring to support this effort and to see it evolve over the past five years,” said Winters, who serves on the board of directors.DiCaprio’s foundation provided $3.4 million over three years to both the Ceibo Alliance and Amazon Frontlines. The funding builds on $1.7 million in donations from 2013 to 2017 to ClearWater from musician Sting’s Rainforest Fund. Of that, the foundation gave the Ceibo Alliance $495,860 last year to get started, and donated $155,000 this year to fund a human rights program. “We are very proud that our support in building clean water systems has led to the formation of the Ceibo Alianza, a truly inspiring union of the ancestral peoples of Ecuador’s Amazon in defense of their forests, their cultures, their rights,” said Franca Sciuto, chairwoman of the Rainforest Fund.The website for Amazon Frontlines documents Chinese oil companies and their spills, as well as poaching and illegal mining, with photos and videos by indigenous Ceibo Alliance members. It offers first-person accounts about tribal traditions, history and culture.

Amazon Frontlines, a new nonprofit funded by DiCaprio’s foundation, plans to launch Thursday with the aim of nurturing an alliance between tribes and trumpeting stories about their fights to stop timber and oil drilling in the South American rainforest.“Amazon Frontlines is the real deal,” Justin Winters, executive director of the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, told HuffPost by email. “This work is what urgent climate action at the community level is all about.” The group springs from an effort to provide clean water to tribes in the region whose water wells were contaminated from decades of drilling by oil giant Texaco. In 2011, Ecuador’s Supreme Court ruled that Chevron, which bought Texaco for $36 billion in 2000, owed $9.5 billion in compensation for dumping more than 18 billion gallons of crude in the once-pristine rainforest ― a slow-moving disaster dubbed “rainforest Chernobyl” by environmentalists.That same year, activists started a group called ClearWater to provide clean water to four indigenous tribes in Ecuador’s Amazon ― the Siona, Secoya, Waorani and Cofan. The tribes, with more than 1,000 families between them, united around the shared struggle. Now, that coalition has formed what’s called the Ceibo Alliance. Amazon Frontlines serves as its sister organization, focused on building water and solar energy infrastructure, documenting evidence of violations against the tribes’ sovereignty and advocating to make their fight public. “It’s been inspiring to support this effort and to see it evolve over the past five years,” said Winters, who serves on the board of directors.DiCaprio’s foundation provided $3.4 million over three years to both the Ceibo Alliance and Amazon Frontlines. The funding builds on $1.7 million in donations from 2013 to 2017 to ClearWater from musician Sting’s Rainforest Fund. Of that, the foundation gave the Ceibo Alliance $495,860 last year to get started, and donated $155,000 this year to fund a human rights program. “We are very proud that our support in building clean water systems has led to the formation of the Ceibo Alianza, a truly inspiring union of the ancestral peoples of Ecuador’s Amazon in defense of their forests, their cultures, their rights,” said Franca Sciuto, chairwoman of the Rainforest Fund.The website for Amazon Frontlines documents Chinese oil companies and their spills, as well as poaching and illegal mining, with photos and videos by indigenous Ceibo Alliance members. It offers first-person accounts about tribal traditions, history and culture. The site also features maps of the region, staking out ancestral claims.“Amazon Frontlines is about taking our cues from the indigenous peoples who have been living and protecting these forest for thousands of years, and who are now on the frontlines of our civilization’s daily incursion into their ancestral homelands,” Mitch Anderson, founder and executive director of the group, told HuffPost by email.“Our team is living and working day-in and day-out in the western Amazon with frontline indigenous communities to support them in their struggles to defend their forests from the threats of oil, mining, logging and poaching, and to build solutions to these threats, such as solar energy, clean water, and economic alternatives.”Still, it’s easy for many in the environmental movement to roll their eyes at wealthy white men who burnish their reputations championing causes while jetting around the world in planes that spew planet-warming emissions.

Katumbi fled the country last year to escape criminal charges that heclaims were politically motivated and orchestrated by his rival, longtime president Joseph Kabila.Kabila has held office since 2001, surpassing the two-term limit he is subject to under the constitution. The Congolese government had scheduled an election for November 2016, which was later delayed until 2019.Since 2016, Kabila’s government and its opposition have shelled out roughly $9 million combined on U.S. lobbying, according to contracts filed under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA).The Congolese government has spent about $7.4 million on U.S. lobbying, in part for support in improving the country’s electoral infrastructure. Lobbyists paid to represent Congo’s interests include firms associated with former lawmakers Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.) and Rep. Bob Livingston (R-La.); the wife of former CIA director and Trump advisor James Woolsey; and former Donald Trump staffer Adnan Jalil.Katumbi has spent almost $670,000 of the opposition’s roughly $1.8 million in lobbying expenses, with the biggest contract going to Akin Gump. In addition to coordinating the Tillerson letter, Akin Gump and a subcontractor lobbied the State Department, the United Nations and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on Katumbi’s behalf, according to FARA filings.It is unclear how effective the two factions’ lobbying will be in directing U.S. policy toward the Congo, however, which appears to be a relatively low priority for the State Department, according to Jason Stearns, director of New York University’s Congo Research Group.In an October visit to the Congo, UN Ambassador Nikki Haley told Kabila that failure to hold elections in 2018 would cost him U.S. support for the electoral process, without providing specifics.What is clear, however, is the economic potential of Congo’s mineral-rich territory.A civil war beginning in the 1990s has produced ongoing violence concentrated in the eastern Congo. Last month, Trump extended an executive order declaring a national emergency with respect to the Congo, which President George W. Bush had first signed in 2006.Foreign interests in Congo have become increasingly corporate following the government’s privatization of its mining assets between 2004 and 2006.In 2013, mining represented between 60 and 80 percent of the country’s foreign direct investment, which amounted to over $7 billion between 2005 and 2010, according to a report by Oxford Policy Management, an international research and consulting firm.Included in the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 was a rule intended to prevent Congolese armed groups from benefiting from mining sales by requiring American companies to disclose the origin of tantalum, tin, gold, and tungsten used in their products.Business groups opposed the rule, arguing that it forced companies to disclose politically charged information and that the costs of compliance were too high.In 2014, a lawsuit filed by U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, which represent electronics producers like Dell, IBM and Verizon, resulted in the limitation of the rule’s disclosure demands.The Congolese government warned that suspending the rule could escalate conflict among armed groups, which made an estimated $185 million annuallyfrom mineral mining prior to the rule and lost ownership of 67 percent of tantalum, tin and tungsten mines in the four years following it.An amendment added to the House spending bill passed in September prohibited any funding to enforce the disclosure rule.Congo’s mining sector had the potential to generate up to $2.7 billion annually through 2017, according to a 2008 World Bank estimate."

The University Star, Texas State’s student newspaper, reported that Ellis died following his fraternity initiation.Ellis, a native of Humble, Texas, was a sophomore transfer student who lived on campus.Based on interviews with people who were with Ellis on Sunday and Monday, investigators believe that alcohol may have been a factor in his death, but toxicology results from the autopsy aren’t expected for six to eight weeks, according to Houston’s NBC affiliate, KPRC 2.Authorities said during a Tuesday news conference that it is still too early to tell if hazing played a role in Ellis’ death.Texas State University President Denise M. Trauth said in a statement Tuesday that she was “deeply saddened by the tragic death.”Trauth added that she was suspending all Greek fraternity and sorority activities while the university completes a review of the Greek system. After the review, Joanne Smith, vice president for student affairs, will recommend which fraternities and sororities can be reinstated.Although a Texas Department of Public Safety official said that she had not heard of an incident like Ellis’ death occurring in San Marcos in the past three years, alcohol-related deaths involving fraternities are common.Florida State University suspended its Greek life activities after Andrew Coffey, a 20-year-old Pi Kappa Phi pledge, was found unresponsive and later pronounced dead following an off-campus party hosted by the fraternity earlier this month. The cause of Coffey’s death is still undetermined, pending the autopsy, but police believe alcohol may have played a role in his death. Pi Kappa Phi ousted its Florida State chapter following the incident.Tim Piazza, 19, died in February after reportedly drinking at least 18 drinks within 90 minutes and falling down stairs during a pledge event for Penn State University’s Beta Theta Pi chapter. Penn State closed the fraternity following Piazza’s death.Prosecutors in Pennsylvania filed charges against 17 individuals involved in Piazza’s death, ranging from involuntary manslaughter to hazing and furnishing alcohol to minors."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0b6cd41f0000e7394a5c13.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One of the starkest images to emerge after Hurricane Irma made landfall in early September came from the Bahamas. The Category 5 storm’s powerful winds sucked away the ocean from the shore, leaving the small islands looking like mere boulders in soggy seabeds as docks extended over air. In videos posted online, people walked where there was once water, highlighting a rare phenomenon scientists say could become more common as rising global temperatures create tempests that are more violent and less predictable.Yet just two weeks later, the government of the island nation signed onto a proposal to let an industry responsible for an increasing amount of planet-warming emissions push back the deadline for beginning to reduce pollution.The shipping industry, which is responsible for 3 percent of global emissions, won’t have to start dialing back its emissions until at least 2023 and possibly after 2050 under the a proposal. By that time, parts of the Bahamas could be uninhabitable as seas rise and destructive storms become the norm.Emissions from the oil-burning freighters that ferry cargo and fuel around the globe are expected to soar from 3 percent of global emissions to 17 percent by midcentury as global trade increases and ships cruise at higher speeds. Yet every major international agreement to reduce planet-warming gases has excluded emissions from ships. There is a United Nations body charged with regulating the shipping industry, the International Maritime Organization. But as a recent report from the watchdog InfluenceMap found, 31 percent of national delegations to the IMO include corporate executives. Industry trade groups spend untold sums ― which remain secret thanks to what critics described as weak financial transparency requirements and opaque disclosure rules ― lobbying the IMO each year. It sends more representatives to IMO meetings and submits more resolutions than most national governments, which critics say is evidence of the degree to which the shipping industry has captured the primary international body that’s supposed to regulate it.The shipping industry’s power is perhaps most notable in small nations that are heavily reliant on shipping. In the early 1980s, the shipping industry began transitioning to the sort of offshore-haven model many financial companies now use to avoid taxes. The owners register their ships under the flags of nations that demand little or no tax. It’s called a flag of convenience.The practice faced some blowback from critics who said it allowed deep-pocketed shipowners to pay lower wages and avoid regulations, but now roughly 80 percent of the world’s fleet operates under a flag of convenience in an open registry, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. Panama, its economy built on shipping through its canal, ranked first globally for the most international ships registered there this year, followed by Liberia, the Marshall Islands and Hong Kong. The Bahamas, with its lack of taxes and low fees on cargo, ranked sixth. An open registry “creates an avenue for shipping companies to influence policymaking,” argued InfluenceMap in its October report.“Often these registry figures feel as if they have the right to direct state policy of these countries they somehow represent, when really they are just corporate figures in the shipping industry,” Ben Youriev, a policy analyst at the InfluenceMap, told HuffPost.The IMO states on its website that its job is to craft regulations that protect the safety and security of shipping and prevent marine pollution from ships. But recently it seems to have taken the first part of its charge to mean the interests of big shipping companies. In 2011, the IMO passed its first and only rule mandating lower emissions from ships, the Energy Efficiency Design Index, which required new ships to improve efficiency 10 percent by 2015, 20 percent by 2020 and 30 percent by 2025. But then, in 2015, when nearly every rich nation on Earth pledged to start reducing carbon dioxide emissions to combat climate change as part of the historic Paris Agreement on climate change, the IMO refused to make any such promise, leaving the shipping industry free to continue business as usual.The IMO has vowed it will work to address emissions, however. In October 2016, the organization approved a road map that would require shipping companies to start reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but not until 2023. This year, the IMO reaffirmed that timeline after industry groups and countries such as the Bahamas, Panama and Saudi Arabia successfully blocked more aggressive proposals before the organization. In late September, the governments of Panama and Saudi Arabia submitted a formal request to temper the ambitions of any policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions because the shipping industry forms “the backbone of international trade for the bulk transportation of raw materials, and for the import and export of food and manufactured goods.”The government of the Bahamas backed that up with a submission urging the organization to commit “to the decarbonization of international shipping” ― but not until “the second half of the century.” The government of Belize signed onto the Bahamas’ proposed revision, as well as the International Chamber of Shipping, the Baltic and International Maritime Council (BIMCO) and the International Association of Independent Tanker Owners (INTERTANKO) ― three of the world’s biggest shipping industry federations. The proposal would essentially give the industry a free pass for the next few decades. That leaves enormous potential for growth in shipping emissions between now and 2050. Shipping emission peaked in 2008 at 916 million tons of carbon dioxide, according to Bryan Comer of the International Council on Clean Transportation, and then fell to 801 million tons in 2013 as international shipping decreased in the wake of the Great Recession. But those emissions are on the rise again as global trade picks up and the economy improves, hitting 812 million tons in 2015, the most recently available data from the group.“We’re going to start seeing exponential growth of emissions over time,” Comer told HuffPost. As emissions rise, so too does the financial risk of failing to invest early in technologies to reduce them, said Tristan Smith, an academic studying energy and transportation at University College London’s Energy Institute. “Fully decarbonising shipping is eminently possible over the forthcoming decades, but this is not yet on track and is risking billions of dollars of misdirected investment and lost opportunity,” he wrote in an email to HuffPost. “Fear and misunderstanding of this inevitable change is significant, including in much of the industry and this is holding up progress.”That message is resonating in some corners of the industry. Last month, Andrew Craig-Bennett, deputy general manager of the British subsidiary of Chinese government-owned shipping giant Cosco, argued in an op-ed in the trade publication Splash 24/7 that the InfluenceMap report got some figures wrong, but “it is basically right, and we all know that it is.” The IMO, Craig-Bennett wrote, “was captured by the shipowning interests” decades ago. But rather than continue to fight climate regulations, he urged the industry to embrace the change, lest it be forced upon companies when the situation becomes more dire. “We all know this change is coming,” he wrote. “We can lead it, get rich and be on the side of the angels or we can share the fate of the other rust belt industries. Simple.” "

During his confirmation hearing last month, Zatezalo acknowledged the safety failures from when he was at Rhino, saying he wasn’t “proud” of them and tried to deal with them at the time. “I did not try to lawyer up and stop anything from happening,” he told senators. “You know, if you haven’t done your job, we should be big kids and deal with it as such.”Zatezalo started his career as a rank-and-file miner but worked his way up to the top of the industry. When he was the chief executive of Rhino, one of the company’s mines was nearly placed on MSHA’s dreaded “pattern of violations” list after a series of safety lapses. The list is typically reserved for the industry’s worst offenders. In 2011, Rhino was fined $44,500 after one of its mine foremen was killed in a wall collapse inside a West Virginia mine. Around the same time, MSHA accused one of Rhino’s mines in Kentucky of trying to hamper safety inspections by MSHA officials.After years of relatively tough enforcement from the Obama administration, coal operators will now have someone from their own ranks in charge of doling out citations and fines. MSHA’s inspection and investigation work is done by career employees, not political appointees, but as MSHA’s chief, Zatezalo will ultimately decide how aggressive the agency is in cracking down on unsafe mines.Mine safety advocates previously told HuffPost that they are skeptical of regulators plucked from the industry but plan to give Zatezalo the benefit of the doubt.In a phone interview with HuffPost in September, Zatezalo said his close relationships with coal operators shouldn’t be a concern. “I don’t agree with that,” he said at the time. “People can say what they’re going to say. Actions speak louder than words.”Mining deaths have been trending downward in recent years as the coal industry has shed jobs, but there’s been an uptick in fatalities this year. Twelve U.S. miners were killed on the job through August, compared with eight over the same period the previous year. There has also been a resurgence of black lung disease in several pockets of Appalachia.Zatezalo said during his confirmation hearing that he was concerned with the number of black lung cases. He said he didn’t want to scale back regulations adopted in 2014 to decrease the amount of coal and silica dust in mines, which lead to black lung and the respiratory disease known as silicosis.“I would not propose any reduction in the enforcement,” he said. “I would not see that diminish in any way.”"

According to the report, the soldiers were ambushed by roughly 200 heavily armed militants ― about four times the number that was previously reported. Witnesses described hearing gunfire for six hours without any reinforcements showing up, despite the village chief’s repeated calls for help to Nigerien authorities.“Everything that happened could have been prevented if help had arrived sooner,” Karimou Yacouba, a local member of parliament, told The Guardian.By the time French aircraft arrived, four U.S. soldiers and five Nigerien soldiers had been killed.

71,POLITICS,Senate One Step Closer To Allowing Drilling In Fragile Arctic Wildlife Refuge,Chris D'Angelo,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/murkowski-arctic-national-wildlife-refuge-bill_us_5a0c3a33e4b0b17ffce18061,"One Democratic senator said a new bill would turn a protected area ""into a petroleum reserve"" if it passed.",2017-11-15,A mother polar bear and her cubs walk in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0c7ab31f0000e7394a5e0a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — Ignoring the pleas of scientists, environmentalists and a bipartisan group of former Interior Department officials, the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources advanced legislation on Wednesday that would open up part of Alaska to oil and gas development. The move would come with unclear economic benefits, and opponents warn it could destroy Alaska’s pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.The proposal would “turn [the refuge] into a petroleum reserve,” Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), the committee’s ranking member, said Wednesday during a hearing.The bill, which committee chair Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) introduced last week, would require that Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke approve at least two lease sales for drilling — each no less than 400,000 acres — in the 1.5 million-acre coastal plain area of ANWR. This region in northeast Alaska, also known as the 1002 Area, has been the subject of a decades-long battle, with many failed attempts to allow for energy development. In her opening statement, Murkowski swung back at claims that introducing the bill as part of Congress’ 2018 budget plan circumvented the normal legislative process. Because the plan is being considered under special “reconciliation” provisions, the bill requires a simple 51-vote majority to pass in the Senate.Murkowski also said she’s “confident” drilling would not come at the expense of the environment.“We have been working on this for some 40 years now,” Murkowsi said, referring to the push to allow for development. “For many of us, we believe that this area — this very productive area — is actually one of the best places that we can go for responsible development, and that we should have done it some time ago.” The refuge, which covers more than 19 million acres, is home to polar bears, moose and hundreds of species of migratory birds, and serves as the calving ground for Porcupine caribou. The full committee advanced the bill by a 13-10 vote, largely along party lines.Democrats introduced a slew of amendments, many of which sought to protect the area and the species that live there. One proposed by Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), for example, would have prevented oil and gas companies with histories of pollution and environmental damage from obtaining leases.The Republican majority voted down all the Democrats’ amendments. When Congress passed the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act in 1980, it expanded the ANWR but opted not to give wilderness status to the 1002 Area, which was set aside for potential oil and gas development. Only Congress can grant leases for that purpose.The bill would allow for 2,000 acres of the coastal plain to be developed with wells and support facilities."
