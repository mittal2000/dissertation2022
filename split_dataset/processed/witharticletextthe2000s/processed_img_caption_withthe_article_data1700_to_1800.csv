0,POLITICS,Trump: U.S. Will No Longer Tolerate Trade Abuses,"By Steve Holland and Matthew Tostevin, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-vietnam-trade_us_5a056050e4b0e37d2f36c905,"“When the United States enters into a trading relationship with other countries or other peoples, we will from now on expect that our partners will faithfully follow the rules.""",2017-11-10,"On the final day of the APEC CEO Summit in Danang, Vietnam, President Donald Trump said the United States was ready to make a bilateral deal with any country in the Indo-Pacific region.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0560ba1b00004800376739.jpeg?cache=PNGuS3OuGq&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"DANANG, Vietnam (Reuters) - President Donald Trump set out a strong message on trade at a meeting of Asia-Pacific countries in Vietnam on Friday, saying the United States could no longer tolerate chronic trade abuses and would insist on fair and equal policies.Trump said the United States was ready to make a bilateral deal with any country in the Indo-Pacific region, but only on the basis of “mutual respect and mutual benefit.”“When the United States enters into a trading relationship with other countries or other peoples, we will from now on expect that our partners will faithfully follow the rules,” he said in the seaside resort of Danang.“We expect that markets will be open to an equal degree on both sides and that private investment, not government planners, will direct investment,” he said in a speech ahead of a summit of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders.Trump arrived in Vietnam from China on the fourth leg of a 12-day trip to Asia. Redressing the balance of trade between Asia and the United States is at the center of Trump’s “America First” policy he says will protect U.S. workers.While China has by far the biggest trade surplus with the United States, Vietnam is also on the list of those surpluses the Trump administration seeks to reduce.APEC, which has long championed free trade, has itself been convulsed by the changes under Trump.Since Trump abandoned the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal early in his presidency, the remaining 11 members have struggled to build momentum to keep it alive.Leaders of TPP countries are due to meet on Friday after talks among ministers ended in confusion on Thursday with Japan’s economy minister saying that they “agree in principle” and his Canadian counterpart saying that was not true.Although he was addressing a meeting alongside the summit of Asia-Pacific leaders, Trump repeatedly referred to the Indo-Pacific region and mentioned the importance of India in his speech.Trump broke early with the “Pivot to Asia” of the Obama administration, worrying some traditional allies that he would allow China to extend its increasing dominance.Danang itself sits on the shore of the South China Sea, one of the region’s biggest security challenges and where China’s neighbors challenge its sweeping claim to most of the waterway as having no basis in law.Danang has a special place in U.S.-Vietnamese history: it was where the first U.S. ground troops disembarked in 1965 in the escalation of a war that would last another decade before the communist victory.Danang was close to some of the heaviest fighting and its air base was the route through which many Americans of Trump’s generation were sent to the war.Trump himself did not serve, receiving five deferments - one for bone spurs in his heel."
1,WOMEN,The Big Ask: Closing Gender Pay Gap For Creative Work Starts With Pricing,"Michele Weldon, ContributorAuthor, Journalist, Emerita Faculty at Northwestern University",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-big-ask-closing-gender-pay-gap-for-creative-work_us_5a0620a2e4b0f1dc729a6adf,"It’s not better working on your own if you are a woman in the creative fields of blogging, writing, photography, design, event",2017-11-10,"<p>Shadiah Sigala, co-founder of HoneyBook, knows about the gender gap for freelancers.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0621011b0000140037692a.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It’s not better working on your own if you are a woman in the creative fields of blogging, writing, photography, design, event planning and more.It’s way worse.Female creative entrepreneurs—also called freelancers, contractors and drivers of the highly skilled, creative economy—endure a gender-based pay gap, larger than the national average. Females earn 32 percent less, with an average income of $28,830 per year, while men earn $43,643 for the same work.A new report from HoneyBook analyzing more than 200,000 invoices from more than 5,000 members, also shows that 63 percent of the female respondents believe they are paid fairly, while 72 percent of the male respondents believe the pay was fair.“We believe this creative energy is the future of work in the U.S.,” says Shadiah Sigala, co-founder of HoneyBook, a platform that manages invoices, payments, networking, referrals and business support for more than 50,000 creative entrepreneur members.The growth is a result, she says, as, “More people are seeking services outside the traditional realm.”A study from Intuit found that 54 million Americans—one third of the U.S. workforce—work as freelancers instead of holding down salaried, traditional jobs.In the HoneyBook study, more than 80 percent of the contractors work alone. Unfortunately, though while the market for creative work is growing, that does not reflect in wage fairness.“We see a real data-driven, glaring gender pay gap for the same type of work,” Sigala says.This pay gap is larger than in salaried professionals at 32 cents per dollar, compared to an average of 24 cents per dollar in all other fields combined.“This is a space where clients are engaging because the person’s art is beautiful or the photography is exquisite so it lends itself to higher prices. This is not a car and driver taking you somewhere,” Sigala explains, who cofounded HoneyBook in 2013 with Oz Alon, CEO and co-founder; Naama Alon, chief of creative + vision and co-founder and Dror Shimoni, CTO and co-founder.What they found is the community of these creative entrepreneurs has also seen a shift within itself of more transparency and sharing of leads to elevate everyone. “We have seen #CommunityOverCompetition spread,” she says.The gender gap is noteworthy not just for the size, but because these freelancers determine their own pricing.The study shows that 20 percent of females are making over $50,000 per year, compared to 42 percent of men. Only 8 percent of women are making more than $80,000 per year compared to 20 percent of men. Seven percent of females are earning $50 per hour, compared to 19 percent of males.As photographers, women earn 59.56 cents on the male dollar. Cinematographers earn 87.84 cents, compared to males earning a dollar.“We asked women if people are haggling with you over price,” Sigala says. “And they say, ‘No, what I ask for is what I get.’”So one solution then, is for women to ask for more money with confidence. Sigala has other concrete suggestions for fair pay. “We want to promote real solutions.”Do the homework. “Work to dig down and give specific recommendations,” says Sigala. Know the market price and have the knowledge of how much is the going rate of a certain project in that city.“Then point to your quality work and say what it is worth for you to do this job,” Sigala suggests.Herself the embodiment of what she calls the American Dream come true as a first generation Mexican immigrant, Sigala attended Pomona College for her undergraduate work. While there she became a community activist and ran a non-profit organization for homeless families.After graduating in 2006, she went to Harvard Business School for her masters. With her degree in 2008, Sigala went to work in health care reform and worked in the public policy division of Aetna Health Insurance until 2011.“With my desire to change the world and knowing how the private sector can change public discourse, I knew I was onto something,” Sigala says. She then became a creative entrepreneur herself.She opened a boutique catering company, Bon Vivant Catering, and ran it from 2011 to 2012. “Like most of the HoneyBook community, I thought it was so glamorous and fun, and I love cooking, but then I had to pay taxes and invoice and market myself. “She adds, “That was the impetus to found HoneyBook.” That and her own wedding planning.“I was working with all these vendors and here they were asking me to fax them a contract and send them a paper check.”With $47 million in venture capital funding to date, Sigala says HoneyBook is “fearless” and has a mission for people to come first.Her suggestions to close the gender pay gap in the creative economy are to talk openly about money and finances; negotiate with confidence and know your worth; collaborate instead of compete and stop working for free.“You need to start treating your business like a business and get really to the nuts and bolts to understand your work is worth more than minimum wage.” Sigala adds, “The crux of it is understanding your value and matching your value with price.”"

The most serious case involves Leigh Corfman, who was 14 when she met Moore, then a 32-year-old district attorney. At one point, she said, he drove her to his home in the woods and undressed her. “I wanted it over with — I wanted out,” she said she remembered thinking. “Please just get this over with. Whatever this is, just get it over.” The statement by Romney, his party’s 2012 presidential nominee, is far stronger than what GOP lawmakers have said.After Romney’s tweet, Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) also came out and said Moore should not represent Alabama in the Senate.Meanwhile, in the state of Alabama, GOP officials have largely given Moore a pass.“He’s clean as a hound’s tooth,” Alabama State Auditor Jim Zeigler said in an interview with The Washington Examiner.The special election will take place on Dec. 12. It’s too late to replace Moore on the ballot, although there has been talk of running someone as a write-in candidate.UPDATE: 1:20 p.m. ― The National Republican Senatorial Committee, the campaign arm of the Senate GOP, severed financial ties with Moore Friday. A joint fundraising committee that benefits Moore and various party organizations filed paperwork to remove the NRSC as one of the beneficiaries. "

6,GREEN,Big Wave Surfer Breaks His Back In Harrowing Wipeout On Video,Mary Papenfuss,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/andrew-cotton-big-wave-surfer-breaks-back_us_5a04c784e4b0e37d2f366d00,"""A whole world of pain happened,"" says Brit Andrew Cotton.",2017-11-10,Pain shows in Andrew Cotton's eyes as he's strapped to a stretcher.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a04e5d31f00003b004a5178.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Legendary big wave surfer Andrew Cotton broke his back in a horrifying tumble from a 50-foot wave off Portugal.The 36-year-old British athlete was pounded by the surf Wednesday as he careened down the wave off Nazaré, Portugal. Scores of fans watched, and a crew filmed the accident and his rescue.“I pulled up over a lump. I knew it wasn’t going to barrel or that I wasn’t going to outrun it, so I just hit the eject button and thought, fuck, I gotta get out of this,” Cotton said in an interview with the surfer blog Magicseaweed from his bed in a Portugal hospital. “Then a whole world of pain happened.” He broke the L2 vertebra in his lower back. “Feeling pretty sore,” he added.Photos of Cotton on a stretcher after the tumble show the pain and tears in his eyes. But, despite the dramatic accident, doctors think Cotton has a good prognosis, according to his wife.“What can I say, I got a little excited this morning and ending up having possibly the worst wipeout, impact-wise, of my life,” Cotton posted on his Instagram after the accident. “Thank you to all the lifeguards and crew on the beach who helped stabilize me and do a great spinal recovery.”He’s already dreaming of the next big wave.“I have broken my back but I’ve been really lucky,” said the indomitable surfer. “I’m already looking forward and focusing my energy to get fit and back out there on some more big rollers!” The surfer’s wife, Katie Cotton, 41, had been in Portugal with her husband and their two children but returned to their home in North Devon, England, last week before the accident.“He’s had an MRI scan and X-rays, he’s got a break in his lower back. It seems like there is a good prognosis for a rapid recovery,” Katie Cotton told The Telegraph.“We have a really good team of support people, and we all feel like he’s got good people and contact with him, but we just want to get him home. I know that all he will be thinking about is when he can get back in the water.”Cotton rode one of the five biggest waves in surfing history in 2014 off Praia do Norte near Nazaré. He was hitting the waves again during filming for a documentary on the return to surfing of Garrett McNamara of Hawaii, who successfully rode what was estimated to be a world-record 100-foot wave off Nazaré in 2013. McNamara also fell spectacularly riding a 50-foot at Mavericks in California in 2016, shattering his left arm. "

He must have.Any Hollywood luminary with years of sexual predation rumors to his name, who then makes a movie about a Hollywood luminary with years of sexual predation rumors to his name, would have known this moment was coming. What is “I Love You, Daddy,” the project Louis C.K. filmed quickly and cheaply this summer? Is it his confession? His farewell? A misguided attempt at a public self-reckoning? A two-hour-long Freudian slip?The allegations lodged against Louis C.K. ― first suggested in a blind item published by Gawker in 2012, and more recently investigated by The New York Times and published in a report on Thursday ― assume an even ickier subtext when held up against “Daddy.” (Just putting the words “Louis C.K.” and “daddy” in the same sentence feels vile.) Not even the comedian’s publicist knew Louis C.K. was making “I Love You, Daddy,” until the Toronto International Film Festival added the movie to its lineup in August. Louis C.K. wrote and financed “Daddy,” and shot it in June on a modest budget, casting himself as a successful television writer who idolizes an esteemed director (played by John Malkovich) long accused of pedophilia and child molestation. Who cares, Louis C.K.’s character, Glen, says in regard to this sordid backstage behavior; it’s “just a story” ― until the director pursues Glen’s 17-year-old daughter (Chloë Grace Moretz). Only then does Glen think twice about his hero. We often see this dynamic with men who invoke their female relatives to express concern about systemic harassment; it only matters when it’s personal. Yep, Louis C.K., whose stand-up sets regularly include jokes about rape, child molestation and masturbation, created a fictional manifesto about processing a public figure’s sexual deviancy, years after he was first accused of jerking off in front of female colleagues and mere months before five women went on the record to confirm such accusations. (The incidents occurred between 2002 and 2005.) Furthermore, the film’s lush black-and-white cinematography resembles that of “Manhattan,” the 1979 comedy in which now-alleged sexual abuser Woody Allen cast himself as a television writer romancing a bright 17-year-old (Mariel Hemingway). The allusion is no accident.As Louis C.K.’s career blossomed ― his FX series, “Louie,” racked up a bevy of Emmy nominations, and he landed supporting roles in movies like “Blue Jasmine,” “American Hustle” and “Trumbo” ― he evaded the allegations in defiant tones.“I don’t care about that,” he told New York magazine in 2016. “I’m not going to answer to that stuff, because they’re rumors. If you actually participate in a rumor, you make it bigger and you make it real,” he told The New York Times in September, when “I Love You, Daddy” premiered in Toronto.In response to the Times’ investigation, Louis C.K.’s publicist, Lewis Kay, said, “Louis is not going to answer any questions.”When HuffPost reached out for comment on Thursday, Kay said, by email, “In the coming days, Louis will issue a written statement.” (Kay announced Friday that Louis C.K. was no longer his client.)That statement was disseminated Friday afternoon. Louis C.K. finally acknowledged the accusations’ veracity. “At the time, I said to myself that what I did was okay because I never showed a woman my dick without asking first, which is also true,” he wrote. “But what I learned later in life, too late, is that when you have power over another person, asking them to look at your dick isn’t a question. It’s a predicament for them. The power I had over these women is that they admired me. And I wielded that power irresponsibly.”As many critics have noted in their reviews, it’s hard to parse the self-awareness of something like “Daddy.” Glen eventually attempts to impart upon his daughter why her relationship with the director shouldn’t continue, in turn evoking cultural conversations surrounding industry fixtures like Roman Polanski and Woody Allen, the latter of whom directed Louis C.K. in “Blue Jasmine.” (As recently as September, during an interview with Uproxx, he said he still “keep[s] in touch” with Allen.)What cause would someone accused of unseemly behavior toward woman have to make such a movie, if not to induce queries about his own sleazy reputation? Knowing that Louis C.K. had, for years, hatched plots and punchlines about sexual misconduct ― in 2014, a hot-button episode of “Louie” depicted an attempted rape ― erases the already vague line that separates this artist’s personal life from his art, as his “Daddy” character attempted to do for the auteur he worshipped. Louis C.K.’s work was informed by his own wrongdoings. He’d handed us all the clues.Was Louis C.K. baiting us with “I Love You, Daddy”? Was he coaxing us to probe his past? Was it a dare?After all, it’s not as if he were merely adding another title to his illustrious big-screen catalog. He hadn’t helmed a movie since 2001′s dumb “Pootie Tang.” Whatever his motive, the whole endeavor reads like a macho ego trip. Either he was telling the world, simply, “You can’t stop me now.” Or, knowing the truth would emerge soon enough, he persuaded indie distributor The Orchard to shell out a sizable $5 million for the rights to a personal therapy session. Plenty of qualified filmmakers who know how to keep their genitals covered when appropriate will never land a deal like that.“It’s a multi-layered comedy that tackles provocative issues head-on, combining a style that shows a clear passion for cinema with Louis’ singular voice,” Danielle DiGiacomo, The Orchard’s vice president of acquisitions, said in a statement in September. “We are thrilled to start this journey with Louis and bring his film to audiences worldwide.”Oh, OK, sure, that works, if “multi-layered comedy” is code for “movie in which Louis C.K. has Charlie Day’s character pantomime jerking off in front of colleagues and Rose Byrne’s character explain why adults fornicating with teenagers maybe isn’t so bad, before ultimately arriving at a moral posture best summed up as, ‘Well, it’s complicated.’”The Orchard canceled the movie’s New York premiere on Thursday, just a few hours before the Times report was published. The company, which said it was “giving careful consideration to the timing and release of the film and continuing to review the situation,” announced Friday that it will no longer distribute “Daddy.” Too late: The Orchard’s general endorsement of Louis C.K. had already been granted. “I Love You, Daddy” is a provocation, full stop, a predator’s demonstration of the very power he now stands accused of exploiting. Whatever his exact design, Louis C.K. knew what he was doing ― even if, in his words, it’s “just a fucking movie.”"

Louis C.K.’s work was informed by his own wrongdoings. He’d handed us all the clues.Was Louis C.K. baiting us with “I Love You, Daddy”? Was he coaxing us to probe his past? Was it a dare?After all, it’s not as if he were merely adding another title to his illustrious big-screen catalog. He hadn’t helmed a movie since 2001′s dumb “Pootie Tang.” Whatever his motive, the whole endeavor reads like a macho ego trip. Either he was telling the world, simply, “You can’t stop me now.” Or, knowing the truth would emerge soon enough, he persuaded indie distributor The Orchard to shell out a sizable $5 million for the rights to a personal therapy session. Plenty of qualified filmmakers who know how to keep their genitals covered when appropriate will never land a deal like that.“It’s a multi-layered comedy that tackles provocative issues head-on, combining a style that shows a clear passion for cinema with Louis’ singular voice,” Danielle DiGiacomo, The Orchard’s vice president of acquisitions, said in a statement in September. “We are thrilled to start this journey with Louis and bring his film to audiences worldwide.”Oh, OK, sure, that works, if “multi-layered comedy” is code for “movie in which Louis C.K. has Charlie Day’s character pantomime jerking off in front of colleagues and Rose Byrne’s character explain why adults fornicating with teenagers maybe isn’t so bad, before ultimately arriving at a moral posture best summed up as, ‘Well, it’s complicated.’”The Orchard canceled the movie’s New York premiere on Thursday, just a few hours before the Times report was published. The company, which said it was “giving careful consideration to the timing and release of the film and continuing to review the situation,” announced Friday that it will no longer distribute “Daddy.” Too late: The Orchard’s general endorsement of Louis C.K. had already been granted. “I Love You, Daddy” is a provocation, full stop, a predator’s demonstration of the very power he now stands accused of exploiting. Whatever his exact design, Louis C.K. knew what he was doing ― even if, in his words, it’s “just a fucking movie.”"

Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amazon-oil-drilling_us_5a05060fe4b05673aa586549,The financial giants are slated to make appearances at the COP23 in Germany next week.,2017-11-10,An oil waste pit in Ecuador's northern Amazon region. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a050aa61b00003e003766ee.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Executives from JPMorgan Chase and BlackRock are scheduled to speak about the need to slash planet-warming emissions next week in Bonn, Germany, at the United Nations’ annual conference on climate change.Yet the financial giants continue to fund at least three companies that drill for oil in the Amazon rainforest, including on tracts of land contested by indigenous tribes, a report released Thursday found.JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank by assets, holds nearly $113 million in combined debt and equity investments in South American oil and gas giant GeoPark, Canadian firm Frontera Energy Corporation and Chinese-owned Andes Petroleum, according to a 16-page report by Amazon Watch, a California-based conservation nonprofit. BlackRock, the investment behemoth, owns $567 million in stocks and bonds in GeoPark, Frontera and the two parent companies of Andes Petroleum. The investments highlight the gap between how many major corporations ― including most big banks and financial firms ― spend their money and the public positions they take on climate change. In recent years, corporate giants have pledged to convert their operations to 100 percent renewable energy, issue sustainability reports and broadcast lofty statements in support of action to curb global warming. Executives make annual pilgrimages to global summits such as the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and the U.N.’s 23rd Conference of the Parties, held this year in Germany.“Like so many big businesses, JPMorgan Chase and BlackRock greenwash their activities rather than apply their resources to real solutions,” Leila Salazar-López, executive director of Amazon Watch, told HuffPost in a statement. “Our report exposes their complicity in Amazon destruction, and we know savvy investors will respond accordingly, as we’ve seen in the massive divestment from fossil fuels and the financial institutions that bankroll them.”Environmental activists have increasingly set their crosshairs on major financial institutions. JPMorgan became the target of a new campaign by the well-funded Rainforest Action Network in September over the bank’s funding of tar sands oil projects. Bank of America faced similar scrutiny last year for backing a company behind the Dakota Access Pipeline.But the Amazon Watch report took specific aim at the companies as they seek to align themselves with the U.S. interests supporting action on climate change at the conference, called COP23. While President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Paris climate accord and is sending delegates to the Germany meeting to advocate for increased fossil fuel use, another group, including California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) and New York State Comptroller Tom DiNapoli, is slated to stump for reducing the use of the fuels responsible for producing planet-warming emissions. Among the latter group will be JPMorgan and BlackRock, as well as representatives from Bank of America, the Coca-Cola Company and candy maker Mars Inc.Aside from the obvious environmental hazards of drilling for oil in the fragile and rapidly-depleting hub of biodiversity that is the Amazon rainforest, the report focused on tensions between the JPMorgan- and BlackRock-funded companies and indigenous groups. GeoPark entered Peru in 2014, and took a majority stake last December in an oil block located in an area of the Amazon where the indigenous Kichwa and Achuar tribes have been fighting drilling for years. JPMorgan has invested $31,151,656 in the firm, while BlackRock owns a stake worth $6,263,139.A block owned by Frontera in the Peruvian Amazon is “infamous for its antiquated, leaky pipeline infrastructure” and its “legacy of dumping billions of gallons of toxic production waters and hundreds of oil spills have left lagoons with oil, contaminated animals, dead fish, cultural knowledge loss, mistreatment of men, women and children,” according to the report. JPMorgan’s investment totaled $23,687,433. BlackRock invested just $18,606. Andes Petroleum was created in the wake of a series of 2009 oil-for-loans deals between Ecuador and China, which now has a near monopoly on crude exports from the South American nation. The company, which operates exclusively in the Ecuadorian Amazon, has battled the Kichwa and Sápara tribes, who say blocks Andes Petroleum purchased in recent years overlap with their territory. The firm is a joint venture between the China National Petroleum Corporation ― in which JPMorgan owns a $24,655,800 stake and BlackRock owns $6,637,000 ― and Sinopec, in which the firms have investments worth $33,462,670 and $553,991,110 respectively. JPMorgan declined to comment, and BlackRock did not respond to a request for comment.This post has been updated to note JPMorgan declined to comment."

12,BLACK VOICES,"Natasha Rothwell On 'Insecure,' Representation And Her Space In Comedy",Taryn Finley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/natasha-rothwell-insecure_us_5a05b96de4b0e37d2f371b8a,The comedian discusses how she uses her passion and platform to ensure curvy black women feel seen.,2017-11-10,"""I feel like there are parts of Kelli that exist within me every day [but] I don’t have those dials turned all the way up to 10.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0606831c00002600b34490.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A standout favorite on Issa Rae’s hit HBO series “Insecure” over the past two seasons has been Kelli, a censor-lacking, good time-having, always “on 10″ friend to the main character.Comedian and writer Natasha Rothwell is the actress who consistently has the show’s fans crying real tears over her outrageous one-liners and outspoken personality. Rothwell, who’s starred in Netflix’s “The Characters” and written for “Saturday Night Live,” has made an indelible mark on the series and industry both on screen and off ― she’s among the less than 5 percent of black TV writers in Hollywood.In promotion of the complete second season of “Insecure” being released on iTunes, Amazon and GooglePlay, Rothwell spoke with HuffPost about regularly making the cast break character with her hilarious improv, writing the irreverent fictional TV show “Due North” and creating a space for curvy black women to see themselves reflected onscreen. When did you realize you were funny?Very much like “Lion King,” my parents held me up like Simba and I told a knock-knock joke. [Laughs.] I have always gravitated toward levity and my parents; I’m sure they have a VHS tape of me when I’m making jokes and trying to make faces when the family was taking a picture. So it’s always been a part of my family and that’s how we are with each other. I grew up in a funny household and I love making people laugh. It brings me so much joy.You’ve noted in past interviews that who you are in real life and Kelli on “Insecure” are so different. How do you tap into the essence of Kelli? It’s not necessarily turning off and on a switch ... playing her ’cause I feel like it’s turning a dial up and down. I feel like there are parts of Kelli that exist within me every day [but] I don’t have those dials turned all the way up to 10. It’s like with Kelli I can turn up the volume on her not having a censor and her telling her friends what she thinks and her speaking her mind, that’s always up to 10. But in real life, I may still have those qualities. They may be at a 3 or 4 depending on the circumstances and who I’m talking to. So for me it’s been balancing what volume she’s at in all aspects of her character. It’s a treat that I get to really tap into her, be free and not care what people think ’cause in real life I care very much about what people think all the time. A little too much, I think. But yeah, that’s how I sort of get away with playing her.Many of your lines are improv, which is super impressive. How do you come up with lines like “Ever been burped?” on the spot? How often do your cast mates break character from laughing at your lines?Well, I’ve been improvising since high school. I did it in college. I [was a part of] Erasable Inc. at University of Maryland, my improv troupe. And then I did it professionally in D.C. in Washington Improv Theater and in New York for years and years and years at UCB. Improv is just one of my favorite forms of expression because you’re really performing without a deck, without a script and you have to listen and really trust who you’re playing with and really build on ideas that already exist. I can really play with how that information is delivered but I wouldn’t be able to do that without Issa and Prentice [Penny] as a director’s support. They really put trust in me.The thing about improv that I really love in scripted television is that it really makes a moment authentic. You know what your key partner is gonna say, you’re waiting for them to say the line before you say your line. It becomes mechanical at a certain point, not really allowing yourself to be in the moment and there’s nothing that puts you in the moment quite like improv. You don’t know what your scene partner’s gonna say but you really have to listen and respond accordingly and so from the beginning when they needed that, a skill that I had and that I loved to do and they allowed me to do it every scene and everything we’ve shot since, they’ve given me opportunities to play. Now I make it a goal. My goal is to make a break. [Laughs.] I will say I’m kinda successful at it. I like making the crew laugh, I like making my scene partners laugh and really making those things a moment. In an unexpected way, Kelli seems to act as an anchor in the friendship. She’s the most off-the-wall but seemingly the one who has her shit together the most. Was that on purpose? I don’t know if it was on purpose but it definitely shook out that way. I got so many people reaching out to me on social media saying Kelli is the one who’s got it together, everyone else got problems. I don’t think it was intentional but I do think that we’re all the [different] versions that link back to Issa. There’s a married, sort of grounded, sort of bougie version of Issa that she doesn’t think is there all the time but Tiffany is there to remind her. There’s the version of Issa that will fly off the handles and not care what people think and I think Kelli sort of represents that. And I think her immediate Gemini twin in Molly where she sees herself the most. I think they balance each other, reflect each other’s personalities the most.It feels like you all are actual friends. What’s the dynamic between you four ladies off screen?It’s amazing. We don’t get to be in a lot of scenes together. It feels like every episode there’s some version of the four of us together. My favorite is when we all get to play ’cause we bring such different energies into the room but it’s so much fun. Each individual woman on her own brings something unique and powerful to the table on and off-screen and so it’s been a real pleasure getting to know them over the last two seasons and going into our third and watching sort of the relationships on screen and off-screen evolve and get stronger. It’s just very rare in this business as a woman of color to be in a situation where I’m performing with all women of color and that represents so many different versions of what it means to be a woman of color. It’s just so rare. So when we get together, it’s just a little black girl magic party because we’re so excited to be in each other’s company and have the opportunity to tell those stories.Will we get more into Kelli’s story in the next season?I hope so. The big thing about Kelli and Molly and Tiffany and all the characters on the show, we’re there to service Issa’s story — and I’m saying Issa as a character but also Issa as the runner of the show. And so my hope is that there’s more Kelli but I don’t want more Kelli if it doesn’t serve the story we’re trying to tell and the journey that [Issa is] on. I think that’s what makes all of the seasoning of the show: we get a little bit of Tiffany, we get a little bit of Kelli, we get a little pop of Thug Yoda. It makes it so desirable because it’s not too much of a good thing and so I don’t want people to get exhausted by Kelli.You also played a major part in writing “Due North.” What inspired the mini-show? We were making a joke in the writers room, to be honest. One of the writers’ last names is Dougan and that’s the “due” part of “Due North,” and we have Dayna North, who’s one of the producers of the show. One day we were at lunch and after lunch we usually go on a walk because we eat a lot and they stuck around the office because they had work to do and we were teasing them like, “What are you guys up to, Dougan and North, here?” So that just evolved into the most ridiculous inside joke and sort of that’s how it started. And once we realized that sort of a show within a show could be a “Scandal” meets “Underground,” we of course in making a name just played right into it. And it was so much fun to write. I feel like some of my favorite things to watch and my favorite things to write are pretty irreverent and definitely subvert expectations and that to me is the core of “Due North.” I think that’s sort of the fun of it. People are watching it, expecting a very reverential show surrounding slavery and it couldn’t be more gaudy and I love that.You’ve been in the game for a while but you’re just recently getting on people’s radar with your relatively Cardi B-paced come-up from UCB to “SNL” to “Characters” to “Insecure.” How have you been able to perfect your craft?I think one of the things that I count on... is it’s about being prolific and not perfect. It’s about creating as much as possible the things that you love, that excite you, that make people laugh and putting your best into that. It’s really hard out there regardless of your background, your talent, your pedigree, it’s very hard and competitive. So I was lucky even to have people recognize what I brought to the table because I tried very hard, very, very hard to [use] my voice and try to tell stories, tell jokes and bring to the table things that I thought were important. I think ... success is when preparedness meets opportunity. And so like you said, the Cardi B come-up, but you said in the beginning that I’ve been in it for a minute and so I’ve been grinding for a long time and so I just wanted to be prepared when the opportunity arose and when the opportunity came. You have to work twice as hard being a woman of color in this industry — in any industry, really — and so I just had my stuff together and to me, that led to the success that you guys are seeing now.I’m still shook by it. Every day I’m like, “I can’t believe I get to do this for a living.” And to me the reason why I work as hard as I do is because I want other people who look like me that are watching the shows to see themselves represented cause I didn’t always have that. And so it’s important to me that I work hard in the time behind the camera and the time in front of the camera and I put out content that’s worthy of people watching, that people are inspired by because we need to diversify what we see and how we see television and stuff. That’s how I feel like my grind has gotten me here.You’re a curvy black female comedian writing and acting on a show on a premium network. We don’t get to see that often, if ever. What significance does the presence you have right now for the culture have for you?I’m a body positive, fat-loving feminist. That’s who I am off-screen. So when the camera’s on, that’s not changing. I might be saying different lines of dialogue, I might be playing a different character, but that’s true of who I am and what I stand for. And for me as a body-positive, fat-loving feminist, I need other thick and beautiful women to see themselves represented in ways where they are charactered but not caricatured. They are grounded characters with real lives, real stories, real backgrounds and the focus of the scene that they’re in is not their size or their color. They’re telling a true, honest story about emotion, about life and death and struggle. And she just happens to be black and she happens to be plus size. By doing that, you really validate their stories by being worthy of being told.It doesn’t have to be something that’s exceptional about the things that you’re doing or mak[ing] it extra black or extra thick or extra whatever. Visibility is so key and I think that’s why “Insecure” is popping off the way it is. “Insecure” is a show about a real regular black girl. She’s not doing anything that’s extraordinary, she’s not finding the cure for AIDS, she’s not out there fighting gang warfare. She’s just kinda broke, likes wine and dick. I love that we get to tell regular stories and actually have diversity in the way that we’re telling those regular stories by having me on the show. [That] makes me feel happy because I’m standing up there for all the curvy chicks. That makes me proud. Team Issa or Team Lawrence? Team Issa all the way!Do you say that as Kelli or Natasha?I say that as a woman!What’s next for you? What other project are you working on or aspire to work on?I have several irons in different fires. Like I said, I’m trying to be prolific if I can and not perfect so I’m taking a lot of opportunities that have been given to me and really trying to run with them. Some stuff that I can’t talk about, some stuff that I can. I am in the middle of working on my show for HBO. We’re in the thick of writing and creating what that show will be and I’m really excited about what it’s looking like and getting to the point where it will be on TV soon. But the immediate, immediate: girl, on Monday, I gotta go start writing season 3, getting back into it. Making sure you guys have entertainment for next year. "

Kelley was released from the military on a bad-conduct discharge in 2014 after serving time for assaulting his wife and stepson.Edwards said that when the two made contact on Facebook in 2014, Kelley said he had been purchasing dogs through Craigslist and then using them for “target practice.” While in the Air Force, she said, Kelley was preoccupied with mass murders and made jokes about killing people.Edwards clarified that she didn’t know for sure if Kelley’s claim about shooting dogs was true, but the statement prompted her to cut off contact with him.The U.S. Air Force confirmed that Edwards and Kelley served at the base at the same time, but not whether they worked together directly, according to CNN.In 2014, the same year he allegedly made the gruesome claim to Edwards, Kelley was cited for cruelty to animals in El Paso County, Colorado. Multiple witnesses said they saw Kelley beating a husky with his fists before dragging the dog away by the neck, The Denver Post reported. The county sheriff who responded to the incident noted back then that it seemed like Kelley was underfeeding the dog. A woman who was his neighbor at the time told The New York Times that she remembers Kelley keeping his dog tied up outside in the sun with no water.Kelley also had a history of domestic violence. The assaults that resulted in his Air Force discharge included striking his toddler stepson “severely enough that he fractured his skull,” according to the Times. And the Sutherland Springs massacre occurred after Kelley had sent threatening texts to his mother-in-law, who sometimes attended that church.Experts say that both cruelty to animals and domestic violence can be predictors of other forms of violence.Most mass shootings in the United States, many of which never make national news, involve domestic violence. Kelley’s military conviction should have prevented him from legally buying a gun, but the Air Force failed to record it in a federal database.In recent years, there’s also been greater consensus among animal advocates, social workers and law enforcement that animal abuse is often an indicator of future violence toward humans.“People need to understand that it is never just the dog,” forensic veterinarian Martha Smith-Blackmore told HuffPost in 2015.Animal cruelty and violence toward people can even be directly intertwined. Domestic violence victims often report that their abusers also threatened to harm or kill the victims’ pets. A 1998 survey in New Jersey found that among homes where child abuse had occurred, 88 percent also had incidents of animal abuse.In 2015, driven by the evidence of a strong link between violence toward animals and people, the FBI began collecting data on animal cruelty though its National Incident-Based Reporting System. This allows the FBI to analyze potential trends in animal abuse and how they might relate to other types of crime.But that doesn’t mean that all state and local law enforcement agencies around the country are taking animal cruelty more seriously. A January 2017 report from the Animal Legal Defense Fund found that some states still fail to mandate mental health evaluations or counseling for animal cruelty offenders or to require someone convicted of animal cruelty to give up their animals."

This allows the FBI to analyze potential trends in animal abuse and how they might relate to other types of crime.But that doesn’t mean that all state and local law enforcement agencies around the country are taking animal cruelty more seriously. A January 2017 report from the Animal Legal Defense Fund found that some states still fail to mandate mental health evaluations or counseling for animal cruelty offenders or to require someone convicted of animal cruelty to give up their animals."

Had the truck had the same sensing equipment that the shuttle has the accident would have been avoided. Passengers onboard the vehicle confirmed that the shuttle did stop ― but in the path of the truck.“The shuttle just stayed still and we were like, ‘Oh my gosh, it’s gonna hit us, it’s gonna hit us!’ and then, it hit us!” passenger Jenny Wong told KSNV. “And the shuttle didn’t have the ability to move back, either. Like, the shuttle just stayed still.”Fortunately, no humans were injured in the crash, the city said.The eight-passenger shuttle is currently offering free rides to people along a half-mile loop in the city’s Fremont East “Innovation District.” The operation is part of a 12-month pilot program, the city said.It’s touted by Las Vegas as the country’s first autonomous shuttle that’s able to communicate with traffic signals and surrounding “smart” infrastructure."

Carman had posted a meme to Facebook during January’s Women’s March asking, “Will the Women’s March protest be over in time for them to cook dinner?” Angered by the move and Carman’s refusal to apologize at a meeting, Bennett decided to run ― and won.“He was worried about women having time to make dinner,” Noah said. “Now karma has given him all the time he needs to make his own dinner.

The Daily Beast reports that the white supremacist got the official badge next to his name Tuesday.The social media company, which recently made public statements about fighting hate speech on its platform, says the blue check mark is used to inform people “that an account of public interest is authentic.”“A verified badge does not imply an endorsement by Twitter,” the site’s policy states.Still, the verified status caused a swift backlash from other users on the platform. Kessler previously called Heather Heyer, the woman who was killed when a car plowed into the crowd demonstrating against the white supremacists that descended on Charlotesville, “a fat, disgusting Communist.” He added that her death was “payback time.”Police identified James Alex Fields Jr., a white supremacist, as the driver who hit Heyer and others at the protest. He has been charged with multiple felonies, including one count of second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and one count of failing to stop at an accident resulting in a death.Last month, Kessler was indicted on a felony perjury charge after video surfaced showing that he had lied to a judge about the reason he punched a man in the face in January. Kessler claimed the man he assaulted had been the aggressor, but video showed otherwise.Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey responded to the backlash on Thursday, saying that the company needed to reconsider its verification process, a system he described as broken.“We failed by not doing anything about it,” he wrote.As a result, Twitter will halt its verification process while it examines how it authenticates users on the platform. The social media company acknowledged that the blue check mark is “interpreted as an endorsement or an indicator of importance.”“We recognize that we have created this confusion and need to resolve it,” the company said in a statement. Still, Kessler’s account remains verified."

Unfortunately, “Gambit” fans have longer to wait ― it’s not estimated to hit theaters until February 2019.According to Tatum himself, the movie’s delay boils down to the production team’s commitment to getting the tone and feel of this particular mutant right. There’s Channing Tatum, the movie star, yes. But there’s also Channing Tatum, the principal producer of Free Association. The latter is thinking more strategically about “Gambit” and wants to make sure it’s properly vetted for Marvel fans and plain-old moviegoers alike.“Stories are complex things. The smallest of things can mean so much to someone,” Tatum told HuffPost during a phone interview. ”‘Gambit,’ yeah it is like an ‘X-Men,’ big, sort of Marvel movie, but Gambit was just a character in my childhood. Gambit is like throwing a pack of cards around my living room at my friends. I have a personal, historical relationship with him at a time in my life when I needed fantasy, and that’s who he is to me.”The problem Tatum and the rest of his “Gambit” production team face now involves taking his version of the X-Men character and relating it to a wider, more critical audience. Unlike other franchise leads, Tatum says he’s more focused on presenting an interesting story, rather than making millions at the box office. “At the end of the day, I don’t know how many people are going to see these things and how much money that that’s going to mean for anyone,” he added. “But did I value my time going and being a part of it and digging into it and what it all means?” Ultimately, that sentiment is the reason the crew is taking their “Deadpool”-level time in pre-production. Still, don’t be mislead. Tatum teases of the Gore Verbinski-led project, “Wait till you see what we’re going to do with it!” His longtime producing partner Reid Carolin chimed in, adding, “You might’ve wanted to wait longer ... It’s definitely going to be crazy.” Tatum and Carolin have been producing film projects together since 2010, starting off small with a documentary on Rwandan genocide titled “Earth Made of Glass.”“I really just played a little EP on it, and it was just a touchingly beautiful story,” Tatum explained. The film ended up winning a Peabody award. That experience, he says, sparked a drive to tell stories that mean something.Carolin ― who penned the script for “Magic Mike” and, in doing so, catapulted his pal into a new stratosphere of fame ― agrees with Tatum’s production strategy, reiterating that not every tale should be told simply because “it just sounds good on paper.”For example, when the idea for their new HBO documentary, “War Dog: A Soldier’s Best Friend,” presented itself, they knew that the story would move viewers.The film, directed by “Earth Made of Glass” helmer Deborah Scranton, follows the personal journeys of three U.S. Special Operations K9s and their handlers through combat and back again. “For me, one of the most deep and meaningful relationships in my life is with my dog,” Tatum said of his four-legged family member with wife Jenna Dewan-Tatum and daughter Everly. “Lulu was kind of my first child. I love her more than I can probably put into words. And going into war is an extreme thing. To have an animal that you don’t really look at as an animal — it’s almost a part of you, like a brother or a sister ― and it’s there to do anything that you ask and vice versa. You’re willing to give your all for him or her. I don’t know, it was just really fascinating to us.”Carolin was particularly interested in the way “War Dog” presented human-animal bonds and how they can transcend the stigma of war. “I hope people, as they’re watching it, don’t really see the dogs as dogs anymore — they see them as soldiers, as beings just like us. That line between dog and human is just completely blurred,” Carolin said. “These guys are so attached to these dogs that the dogs trigger the best parts of them to open up and be vulnerable on screen.”Both Tatum and Carolin are happy to continue working with each other in the fair-weather industry and don’t take the opportunity for granted. After bonding on the set of the 2008 film “Stop-Loss,” the two have continued to team up on projects like the “Magic Mike” movies, “22 Jump Street,” “Logan Lucky” and the upcoming Joseph Gordon-Levitt R-rated musical comedy, “Wingmen.” “Not to be cliché, it is the best to go to work with your buddy everyday,” Carolin said, to which Tatum replied, “I’m super thankful for anyone who makes me get into a thong ever again. That’s a really great friend.” “War Dog: A Soldier’s Best Friend” hits HBO On Demand, HBO NOW and HBO GO on Nov. 11 and airs on the network on Nov. 13 at 8 p.m. "

Attempts to reach Venit for comment were not immediately successful.This story has been updated with comment from the LAPD."

John McCain called on Moore to ""immediately"" step aside.",2017-11-09,"Republicans are calling for Roy Moore, the GOP nominee for a special election to represent Alabama in the U.S. Senate, to step aside if allegations that he sexually assaulted a 14-year-old girl are true.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a04ac4b1f00003b004a50cd.jpeg?cache=RqRecb4TbA&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Republicans distanced themselves from GOP Alabama Senate nominee Roy Moore on Thursday after a woman alleged that the controversial judge sexually assaulted her when she was 14 years old.Leigh Corfman, who is now 53, told The Washington Post in a deeply reported article published Thursday that Moore, then a 32-year-old assistant district attorney, took off her shirt and removed his clothes in the 1979 incident. He touched her over her bra and led her hands to touch him over his underwear, she said.Three other women who spoke to the Post said Moore “asked them on dates when they were between 16 and 18 and he was in his early 30s.”Moore’s campaign blasted the report in a statement on Thursday, saying he was the victim of a “systematic campaign to distort the truth about the Judge’s record and career and derail his campaign.”“After over 40 years of public service, if any of these allegations were true, they would have been made public long before now,” Moore’s campaign said.Only one Republican in the chamber, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, called on Moore to “immediately” step aside. Other Republicans, however, said that he ought to do so if the allegations are “found to be true,” as one senator put it.“The allegations against Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore are deeply troubling,” Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said in a statement. “If these allegations are found to be true, Roy Moore must drop out of the Alabama special Senate election.”Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), whose allied group the Senate Leadership Fund opposed Moore in the Alabama Senate primary, echoed Gardner.“If these allegations are true, Roy Moore should step aside for all the obvious reasons. These are very disturbing allegations,” McConnell told reporters on Thursday.Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), the No. 2 Republican leader in the chamber, called the allegations against Moore “deeply disturbing.” Cornyn endorsed Moore last month.Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said she had spoken to Sen. Luther Strange (R-Ala.), who lost to Moore in the Alabama Senate primary, about potentially running a write-in campaign before the Dec. 12 special election.Alabama law prohibits withdrawal of a candidate from a ballot within 76 days of the election.Reached by phone on Thursday, Alabama’s Republican secretary of state, John Merrill, said he had no comment about whether Moore should withdraw from the race. He noted that, under the state’s election law, Moore’s name will still appear on the ballot in December.“The people of Alabama will have an opportunity to have their voice heard. That can’t change,” he said, calling sexual allegations against Moore “just another piece of information that will allow them to make their decision.”Merrill questioned the timing and source of the report, however. “It’s odd to me that this information has just been introduced. In all the campaigns Judge Moore has ever run before ― and he has run a lot of them, probably a dozen campaigns. It’s very, very odd to me this information has just been introduced.”He added that Alabama is home to many “outstanding news people” and that “not one of those people has ever been able to” unearth the allegations in the Post story.Richard Shelby, the senior senator from Alabama and also a Republican, similarly called on Moore to withdraw if the allegations are proved true. “If that’s true, I don’t believe there’d be any place for him in the United States Senate,” he said.This post has been updated with more reactions. CORRECTION: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Sen. John McCain is retiring."

Gorka is known for espousing aggressively anti-Islamic views during his numerous TV appearances on behalf of the president both before and after the election. In August 2016, while also advising Trump’s campaign, he told law enforcement officials at a FBI course that all Muslims are either already radicalized or soon to be radicalized, the Daily Beast reported. (The FBI subsequently terminated his gig as a lecturer.) And in August of this year, he was reportedly upset that Trump did not use the phrase “radical Islam” or “radical Islamic terrorism” in a speech about Afghanistan.Yet for all his self-professed knowledge on the topic, Gorka has spent little time in the Middle East and does not speak Arabic.Also troubling are Gorka’s ties to Nazi sympathizers. In January, he wore a medal given to him by his father that signified his father’s membership in Vitezi Rend, a Hungarian group that had collaborated with Nazis during World War II.“I’m a proud American now and I wear that medal now and again,” British-born Gorka told Breitbart News. He said it was to remind him what his parents had suffered.An investigation by Forward magazine found that Gorka had worked with anti-Semitic groups and public figures between 2002 and 2007. When he was asked about those people, Gorka deflected by noting that his parents had “lived through the nightmare of WWII and the horrors of the [Hungarian] Nyilas puppet fascist regime.”After Trump won the election, Gorka boasted that “the alpha males are back.” Shortly before the Charlottesville protests that turned violent, he insisted that white supremacists are not “the problem.” So it seems Gorka will be a perfect fit for Fox News."

Ryan Weideman is an artist who moved to New York in 1980 in hopes of becoming a street photographer. He took a job driving a cab to pay bills, and began photographing his passengers. Nearly 40 years later, it’s clear he captured a time capsule not just of people, but of style, too. “By photographing the spectrum of characters comprising this burgeoning period ― from models to poets, drag queens to celebrities, business men to prostitutes ― Ryan Weideman skillfully transformed his taxicab into a highly-functional artist studio,” states a summary by the Bruce Weinstein gallery, which represents Weideman.Weideman shot the photos during his shifts, which were from 5 p.m. to 5 p.m., according to the gallery. In some of the photos, Weideman is pictured with his subject (the original selfie, if you will), while in others, only the passenger is captured.In a 2016 New York Times article, writer John Leland wrote that although Weideman “usually” asked permission of his subjects, he once “said simply, ‘Don’t move, I’m a photographer,’ and just started shooting.”His photos can be seen in a 91-page book aptly titled “In My Taxi,” and were most recently on display this summer at the Espronceda gallery in Barcelona, Spain.The power suits, the fishnets, feathered hair ― it’s all so deliciously plucked from the ’80s and ’90s.

The opening line of their pro-charter school editorial offered faint praise for charter schools. Apparently, “New York City is one of the rare places in the country where charter schools generally have made good on the promise to outperform conventional public schools.” If the statement is true that New York City charter schools “generally” outperform conventional public schools, what about the rest of the charter school industry in the United States?According to the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, “In 2016-17, there are more than 6,900 charter schools, enrolling an estimated 3.1 million students.” In New York City there are only 227 charter schools that enroll a little over 100,000 students. That means 97 percent of charter schools in the country and 97 percent of the children attending charter schools are outside New York City and many do underperform. In Michigan, 70 percent of the charter schools score in the bottom half of the state’s school rankings. As a result of “charterization,” Michigan declined from being an average performing state on math and reading tests to one of the worst. These do not seem like a reason to endorse an expansion of charter schools in New York City or to advocate for removing regulations from the existing schools.I visited two excellent New York City charter secondary schools, one in Queens and one in Brooklyn. Neither is part of a “not-for-profit” charter school network or a private for-profit charter school company. Part of what makes them good schools is that they function just like regular public schools, educating diverse young people without making exaggerated claims for student performance or lobbying state officials for extra privileges and waivers.In the editorial, the Times argues “The Best Charter Schools Deserve More Leeway on Hiring,” and endorsed a decision by the State University of New York Board of Trustees to allow “high-performing” charters, a loosely defined category, to hire uncertified, untrained people as classroom teachers. The charter networks and their supporters claim they need to do this because they can’t find enough qualified teachers to fill available slots. But the real reason charter networks can’t fill positions is because of high teacher turnover. I know that, because I read it in the New York Times. Charter networks treat teachers as interchangeable parts that can be plugged into classrooms where they follow scripts and can be repeatedly replaced by other untrained personnel. However serious academic research conducted in New York City, and cited in the New York Times, show that the education of children suffers from high teacher turnover, especially in English and math. Over a fifteen-month period from December 2014 to March 2016, New York City’s highly touted Success Academy Charter School Network the teacher attrition rate may have approached 30 percent.Similar teacher certification waiver programs are in place in other states. The Florida “Schools of Hope” initiative eliminates teacher certification requirements for charter schools. Proponents ignore that Florida has been forced to close over 340 charter schools for poor performance. In Ohio and Michigan charter schools can hire unqualified, uncertified people as teachers as long as they had a C+ “passing” average in college and really want to teach.The Times editorial dismissed criticism of the SUNY Trustees because it came from the State Board of Regents, which oversees education and teacher certification, and the teachers’ union. But it failed to mention that the “Trustees” are uniquely unqualified to establish educational policy. Four of the five SUNY Trustees have no experience in education and they are all political appointees aligned with Governor Cuomo, hedge fund political donors, and pro-charter forces. The fifth SUNY Trustee is Merryl Tisch, deposed Chancellor of the Board of Regents. Tisch was appointed to the SUNY Board by Governor Cuomo in June 2017 after the teacher de-certification plan had already been proposed and she quickly lined up with the other trustees. As the New York Times reported, Tisch had previously resigned from the Board of Regents because of public backlash against her strong support for the constant high-stakes testing of children and the use of student test scores to grade teachers.The Times editorial bad-mouths traditional teacher education programs as inadequate based on a study promoted by a group called the National Council on Teacher Quality (NCTQ). The editorial links to their report, but if the editors bothered to dig a little deeper they would have uncovered grounds for suspicion. Both the NCTQ and the report are funded by anti-public school, pro-charter foundations, including the Eli and Edythe Broad Foundation, The Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, and the Searle Freedom Trust, which is also a major funder of rightwing groups including Americans for Prosperity, the American Enterprise Institute, the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). Shame on the New York Times editorial team for finding what they wanted to find and for not fact-checking.In addition, the Times editors never commented on a series of scandals at the largest New York City charter school network that were covered in of all places, the New York Times. In February 2016, The New York Times reported on video showing a Success Academy charter school teacher chastising a young African-American girl who is confused about a math problem. The teacher ripped up her paper and sent her to the “calm-down chair,” although the only one who is not calm in this sequence is the teacher. The teacher then addressed the entire class telling them in a loud and agitated voice, “There’s nothing that infuriates me more than when you don’t do what’s on your paper.” The Times also reported that Success Academy considers this her a model teacher and assigns her to train colleagues.Eva Moskowitz, CEO of Success Academy called the video an anomaly, but according to former Success Academy teachers, that is the school culture. In an interview in the New York Times, one former teacher is quoted, “If you’ve made them cry, you’ve succeeded in getting your point across.”Success Academy was also caught trying to drive out children and families who could not adapt to their punitive disciplinary rules and oppressive teaching style. At least one of the network’s schools kept a “got to go” list of children they wanted out. How do I know? The report was in – guess – the New York Times.Success Academy is an example of the disastrous marriage of charter schools and high-stakes standardized testing at their worst. On May 9, the principal at Success Academy Bronx 1 Middle School posted on the school’s Facebook page, “Congratulations on finishing our Think Mastery season!” She went on to say, “This is my favorite time of year for many reasons, but mostly because of the hard work of teachers, parents and our kids, who come together to truly achieve excellence!”Success Academy and CEO Eva Moskowitz, who brags about the network’s scores on high-stakes standardized exams and uses them as a wedge to lobby for increased sites and waivers from state agencies, are incredibly secretive about what goes on inside their domain. There are no other references to “Think Mastery Season” on the Internet but the test-prep agenda was observed in 2014 by a reporter for Chalkbeat. Success Academy scholars begin test prep as soon as they return to school in the fall with network-produced packets modeled on state tests and extra test-prep sessions called “Close Reading Mastery.” After the new year students are drilled with practice tests. By March, they spend “weeks taking practice tests modeled off the actual state exams” and participate “in test ‘dress rehearsals,’ where exact testing conditions were simulated.” Everything at Success is about the test, not about learning. Students get prizes like pizza and Popeye’s chicken for performing well on daily practice tests. High scorers have headshots posted in the hall. Poor performers are sent to retraining camps that sound like something out of Maoist China – “Effort Academy” or “Revision Academy.”Success Academy has made its literacy program for grades kindergarten though 4 available online. It contains such gems as its opening instructions for teachers directing fourth graders doing independent reading: “Scholars will only become better readers if you fuel their passion AND are fully invested in creating and maintaining excellence during this time. Set clear expectations for how scholars keep their minds and bodies engaged during Independent Reading.” The clear expectations include: “2 eyes reading,” “2 hands on the book,” and “2 feet on the floor.” I generally read with two eyes, I sometimes hold a book with two hands, but I rarely keep two feet planted firmly on the ground, I squirm too much. These guidelines are about control and creating rigid factory-like conditions, not about promoting literacy. I challenge anyone to become a passionate reader employing Success’ methods.In my experience as an educator, what’s too good to be true is too good to be true. Success Academy has not made its test packets and sample test material available for review. If they are so miraculous, why isn’t Success required to share them with public schools as a condition for the renewal of the corporation’s charters? Other charter schools in New York State have been investigated for mismanagement that borders on illegality. Niagara Charter School “spent thousands of dollars on plane tickets, restaurant meals and alcohol, and more than $100,000 on no-bid consulting contracts.” Roosevelt Children’s Academy “hired two of the school’s board members as new managers — and paid them hundreds of thousands of dollars.” Family Life Charter School” in the Bronx paid “$400,000 annually to rent classroom space” from a religious ministry headed by the school’s founder.

I can picture, clear as day, walking through my campus and listening to people around me talk about the results of the election and looking up at the impending storm.That is, of course, only my recollection—in reality, the morning of Nov. 9 may have been cloudless and sunny (through some research it seems like the day was overcast, though perhaps not the “moment before the storm” darkness that I imagined).Why do I remember that morning in that way? Pathetic fallacy, I suppose. Nov. 9, 2016, was a dark day, emotions-wise, for a lot of people, so in my mind I’ve equated the emotions and the weather.I’ve written before about the moment I found out that Donald Trump won the election—I heard loud, bewildered shouting in the middle of the night, and assumed the outcome that was a growing possibility had turned into reality. In hindsight, I wish I had stayed up to watch the full coverage of the election, even though it crept into the darkest hours of the night and then the early hours of morning (and even though I had a journalism assignment due the next day).At the time, I think very few people had an inkling of what was about to happen. When the world woke up on Nov. 9, on the morning I remember to be grey, a lot of us asked the same thing: What now?As I wrote in my post after the election, I had been ready to write an article about the first female president of the United States. Accepting not just that I wouldn’t be writing that article, but that I would not be seeing that reality—for at least four years, and likely longer—was disheartening, to say the least. But it was not only Hillary Clinton’s loss that made Nov. 9 difficult; it was who she had lost to, and the policies and rhetoric that were about to take centre stage in the Oval Office.Watching Clinton’s concession speech made me cry but I was determined to move forward with an attitude of hope. “I looked at my reflection in the mirror and promised myself that I was going to keep fighting for what I believe in, and supporting others who are doing the same,” I wrote.That bleary morning turned into another night, and then another day. Time passed. In January, Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. I won’t list everything that has happened since then because, unless you disconnected your cable and Internet after the election, you likely know what has happened next. There were, in short, a lot of reasons to be concerned, fearful and angry.But there were also reasons to be hopeful. One of the best examples of this was the Women’s March the day after Trump’s Inauguration (pictured above). The sheer number of women and men marching in solidarity both in the U.S. and around the world was nothing short of incredible. The message of the marches was loud and clear: Trump can try to limit women’s rights, but women will not be intimidated by this—they will fight for what is right.The ACLU was also a strong force in standing up for equality, freedom and human rights. “President Trump has been in office for 42 weeks. We’ve sued him and his administration 56 times,” the organization tweeted yesterday.Another source of hope came two nights ago. It was election night in America all over again. I had an eerie sense of déjà vu as I curled up on my couch and watched the news. The music, the graphics, the anticipation building up to the results. I allowed myself a smile when the journalists said certain races were too close to call, thinking of the failure of many to accurately call the election last year.But the feelings of déjà vu ended when the results starting coming in. It wasn’t just that Democrats secured two major victories in the gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey—it was there were historic wins for representation and equality.Danica Roem, an openly transgender woman was elected to the Virginia state legislature. Not only this, but the incumbent Republican she beat, Robert Marshall, actually called himself the state’s “chief homophobe” and previously introduced a controversial “bathroom bill.” Roem had an incredibly classy response to a question about her predecessor. “I don’t talk about my constituents. Bob is my constituent now,” she said. (Mic. Drop.)Virginia also elected its first two Latina delegates. Another notable victory included Ravi Bhalla, who is Sikh, being elected mayor of Hoboken, New Jersey (interestingly, Bhalla has called himself “everything Trump hates”). He is the first Sikh mayor in New Jersey. Vi Lyles was elected mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina, the first black woman to hold that post. The list goes on—you can read more about the historic wins in this Vox article.Today marks one year since the morning many of us woke up worried about the future. There are, of course, still reasons to be worried. But there are also a lot of reasons to be hopeful. In the year since Trump won the election, people looking to make their voices heard have mobilized into movements. On Tuesday, voters showed a rejection of Trump’s rhetoric in favor of acceptance of the very people who Trump speaks out against. The newly elected political representatives now have the power to create real, positive change in America.This is progress. This is a reason to be hopeful. And it is a reason to keep speaking out and speaking up as we continue to live in the world that was made a reality on this day last year."
30,POLITICS,Voter Fraud Commissioner Is Suing The Panel Trump Tapped Him To Serve On,Sam Levine,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-voter-fraud-commissioner-lawsuit_us_5a046ec8e4b03deac08baf8b,Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap has expressed frustration over the lack of information on the commission's activities.,2017-11-09,"Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap is suing President Donald Trump's voter fraud commission, of which he is a member.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a046f2b1f00003b004a4fb2.jpeg?cache=xuUSuwqnTA&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A member of President Donald Trump’s voter fraud commission filed a lawsuit against the panel Thursday in an attempt to obtain more information about its activities.Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap (D) filed the suit in federal court in Washington, D.C. Dunlap has openly expressed frustration about the lack of information he has received on the commission’s activities and even who is staffing it.“Since the Sept. 12 meeting, I have received no correspondence from the commission other than to acknowledge receipt of my information request,” Dunlap said in a statement.The commission, formally called the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, has met publicly twice since Trump created it in May. Its last meeting was on Sept. 12, and the commission has said nothing about what it is working on since then.“My goal in filing this lawsuit is to bring the commission into full compliance with FACA, which would allow me and all of my fellow commissioners to fulfill our roles as full, participating members and provide a meaningful report to the President upon concluding our work,” Dunlap’s statement continued.Dunlap accuses the commission of violating the Federal Advisory Committee Act, a law that requires federal advisory committees to disclose documents shared among people serving on a panel with the public.Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R), the commission’s vice chair, dismissed the lawsuit.“Secretary Dunlap’s lawsuit is baseless and paranoid. In it, he complains that he didn’t receive any correspondence from the Commission during the five weeks between September 12 and October 17. He assumes that correspondence regarding Commission business was occuring [sic], but not being shared with him. Dunlap’s assumption is incorrect. I did not receive any such correspondence either,” Kobach said in a statement. Kobach continued: “During that period, Commission work was stalled by three things: (1) litigation defending against eight lawsuits filed by groups seeking to stop or delay the Commission’s work; (2) the loss of commission staff due to an unrelated arrest of a staff member; and (3) the tragic death of Commissioner David Dunn during heart surgery. It is not at all surprising that Commission staff were very busy during this period. Ironically, Dunlap’s lawsuit is only going to increase the workload faced by Commission staff and Department of Justice Attorneys.”This suit adds to a slew of litigation aimed at the commission. Over a half-dozen federal lawsuits have been filed against the commission, accusing it of violating various privacy and transparency laws, including another over its failure to comply with FACA. The Government Accountability Office also recently announced it would investigate the commission.“Today’s lawsuit is unprecedented and underscores the chaotic and dysfunctional nature of this Commission,” said Kristen Clarke, the executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which is bringing the other suit against the commission over alleged FACA violations. “That its own members are in the dark on the way that the Commission operates and deliberates makes clear that this Commission is no more than a tool to advance this administration’s voter suppression agenda.” As part of the other suit dealing with FACA obligations, the commission disclosed a log of all its email communications so far. The document showed Kobach communicating privately with Hans von Spakovsky and J. Christian Adams before the panel requested voter information from states. Kobach excluded other commissioners from the exchange even though von Spakovsky and Adams hadn’t yet been formally nominated to the commission at that time.In an email to private individuals earlier this year, von Spakovsky also warned against tapping Democrats to serve on the commission, complaining they would hinder its work. The email was eventually forwarded to an aide to Attorney General Jeff Sessions. In a tweet Thursday, Adams suggested von Spakovsky was right to express an interest in keeping Democrats off the panel.Von Spakovsky called the lawsuit “meritless” and said it “reads like a press release.” “The complaint was obviously intended to garner publicity and sabotage the commission,” he said. “Dunlop [sic] should be sanctioned for filing a frivolous lawsuit and should resign from the commission.” This story has been updated with more details about lawsuits against the commission, reactions to Dunlap’s suit and an email from von Spakovsky."
31,POLITICS,"Republicans Full Speed Ahead On Tax Reform, Election Consequences Be Damned",Matt Fuller and Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-tax-reform-election-results_us_5a03997fe4b03deac08b14fa,You will not stop the tax cuts. Nothing must stop the tax cuts.,2017-11-09,House Speaker Paul Ryan and his GOP leadership team appear to be as determined as ever to pass a tax bill this year.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a039a7c1b00003e003763d3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Despite a growing sense that a Democratic wave could be coming in 2018, House Republicans showed little sign of letting up on their tax proposal Wednesday, with a bill set to move out of committee on a party-line vote Thursday and onto the floor as early as next week.The way Republicans have gone about drafting their legislation so far, with closed-door GOP-only negotiations producing sudden wholesale changes, suggests that nothing will stop them from pushing this bill through the House. GOP leaders look ready to discard any provision or make any deal to get the votes they need.The House Ways and Means Committee, which oversees tax legislation, plans to advance a revised version of the measure after adopting an amendment that would, among other things, cut a tax on multinational corporations and clamp down on some low-income workers claiming a tax credit.Even before committee members began consideration of the bill ― which was just the day after it was introduced ― the author of the legislation, Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas), had changed how soon income brackets would move from a standard adjustment for inflation to one that rises more slowly. Using a slower inflation measure raises more money for the government (in this case, an additional $128 billion over 10 years) as people are pushed into higher brackets.The House bill still pays for significant cuts to the corporate tax rate and some reductions to individual income taxes in part by eliminating sundry personal exemptions and slashing the state and local tax deduction, which allows taxpayers to write off their local taxes. But GOP leaders have cut a deal to allow people to write off the first $10,000 of their state and local taxes.The latter would go a long way toward making sure voters in high-tax blue states ― like New York, New Jersey and California ― don’t see a big increase in their tax bills. Still, some Republicans don’t think the deal is good enough.Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) has been leading the opposition to the elimination of the state and local tax deduction. Even with the changes, King knows that his Long Island district would be among those financing a tax cut for the rest of the nation.“It’s great to get something done,” King said of tax reform on Wednesday, “but not if it’s something that’s going to hurt you. And not just politically, it would hurt us governmentally.”After Democrats beat Republicans soundly in off-year elections on Tuesday, congressional Democrats thought their colleagues might hesitate to push through a partisan tax reform bill, especially one that could raise taxes in places with vulnerable Republican lawmakers.“If you think the results [in Tuesday’s elections] were terrible for you, wait till you pass a bill that raises taxes on middle-class families in your district,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told reporters on Wednesday.But instead of thinking twice, GOP lawmakers may be even more intent on passing a measure now. Republicans may want something big they can to point to next year, rather than just running on unfulfilled promises or the culture war tactics that failed on Tuesday.At the very least, the election results seem to be confirming to Republicans what they already thought of the tax bill.For Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), the first member of Congress to endorse Donald Trump for president and a staunch supporter of tax reform, Republicans have no choice but to pass their tax proposal. “The pressure is so intense, I don’t think you could put more pressure on us,” Collins said.But for King, his New York colleague, the poor GOP showing on Tuesday is evidence that Republicans can’t afford to put vulnerable members in a position where they raise taxes on some of their own constituents.“If you get a tax cut which is going to raise taxes on your constituents, it makes no sense,” King told HuffPost on Wednesday.King has been whipping up opposition among other Republicans whose districts, like his, benefit significantly from the state and local tax write-off. He has more than a half-dozen Republicans with him from New York and New Jersey, although he’s had little luck getting California Republicans to speak against the tax bill.“Must be something in the water,” King said of his Pacific coast colleagues.Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) has come out against the tax bill, citing concerns over the state and local tax deduction among other issues. But most of the other California Republicans have shown a remarkable willingness to go along with their leadership’s plans, even if it means tax increases on some of their constituents.It’s true that not all congressional districts in the Golden State are affected to the same degree. Yet their GOP representatives seem to be grading the tax bill more gently than some other Republican lawmakers, with all California Republicans voting twice for budgets that set up consideration of the tax legislation even when New York and New Jersey Republicans voted no.After a state delegation meeting on Tuesday, Rep. David Valadao (R-Calif.) said the reaction from his GOP colleagues was, “for the most part,” pretty positive ― although he did caution that it was hard to get read on everyone without asking directly.Valadao reported that he was “leaning positively” on the bill. When HuffPost asked whether it was fair that taxpayers from some states would see bigger tax cuts than those from other states, he suggested his standard was whether his constituents would benefit on average.“The way I’ve always looked at tax policy is how it affects the average constituent and how it affects job growth and the ability for a business to be successful,” he said.Valadao is right that his district wouldn’t be as adversely affected as others in California, but Republicans from other high-tax states are less persuaded by this argument. They fear a trickle-down effect from eliminating the state and local tax deduction.On Wednesday, Rep. John Faso (R-N.Y.) made the point to reporters that, even though his own district wouldn’t be affected that much by the deduction’s loss, getting rid of that write-off could drive extremely wealthy people out of the state and thus cause New York to suffer lost business and lost tax collection.House Democrats seem to be taking that same bigger-picture approach to the state and local deduction question, with many wondering why their Republican counterparts don’t see it the same way.Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) told HuffPost that he gave some Republicans from New York and New Jersey credit for voting the interests of their state. “California Republicans have forgotten they represent California and have just been marching right off the cliff like lemmings,” he said.Huffman also argued that Tuesday’s elections ought to be a “wake-up call” for his state GOP colleagues, particularly because there are so many competitive Republican-held districts in California. He said that if Republicans continued this “party-line nonsense against the interests of our state, I think the voters at some point are going to help them find a new job.”The bottom line, however, is that most House Republicans seem to think they are voting for the interests of their state in supporting the tax bill. Republicans insist this is a pro-growth tax cut that will pay for itself. And there may not be enough Republicans from high-tax areas whose votes are in question to force GOP leaders to change the bill. On the last budget vote, only about a dozen Republicans voted no because of the state and local tax issue. Almost another dozen Republicans could vote no over other concerns, and leadership could still pass the bill out of the House.While GOP leaders are sensitive to their party potentially losing seats next year, key Republicans also doubt that the poor election showing on Tuesday was a result of the House trying to eliminate a specific tax deduction.As Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, told HuffPost on Wednesday, Republican losses were “not based on state and local tax issues.”“The fact of the matter is, that wasn’t an issue in Virginia last night,” he said."

GOP leaders look ready to discard any provision or make any deal to get the votes they need.The House Ways and Means Committee, which oversees tax legislation, plans to advance a revised version of the measure after adopting an amendment that would, among other things, cut a tax on multinational corporations and clamp down on some low-income workers claiming a tax credit.Even before committee members began consideration of the bill ― which was just the day after it was introduced ― the author of the legislation, Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas), had changed how soon income brackets would move from a standard adjustment for inflation to one that rises more slowly. Using a slower inflation measure raises more money for the government (in this case, an additional $128 billion over 10 years) as people are pushed into higher brackets.The House bill still pays for significant cuts to the corporate tax rate and some reductions to individual income taxes in part by eliminating sundry personal exemptions and slashing the state and local tax deduction, which allows taxpayers to write off their local taxes. But GOP leaders have cut a deal to allow people to write off the first $10,000 of their state and local taxes.The latter would go a long way toward making sure voters in high-tax blue states ― like New York, New Jersey and California ― don’t see a big increase in their tax bills. Still, some Republicans don’t think the deal is good enough.Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) has been leading the opposition to the elimination of the state and local tax deduction. Even with the changes, King knows that his Long Island district would be among those financing a tax cut for the rest of the nation.“It’s great to get something done,” King said of tax reform on Wednesday, “but not if it’s something that’s going to hurt you. And not just politically, it would hurt us governmentally.”After Democrats beat Republicans soundly in off-year elections on Tuesday, congressional Democrats thought their colleagues might hesitate to push through a partisan tax reform bill, especially one that could raise taxes in places with vulnerable Republican lawmakers.“If you think the results [in Tuesday’s elections] were terrible for you, wait till you pass a bill that raises taxes on middle-class families in your district,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told reporters on Wednesday.But instead of thinking twice, GOP lawmakers may be even more intent on passing a measure now. Republicans may want something big they can to point to next year, rather than just running on unfulfilled promises or the culture war tactics that failed on Tuesday.At the very least, the election results seem to be confirming to Republicans what they already thought of the tax bill.For Rep.

A short, simple word—that when felt can sustain a life… and when absent… can make us feel helpless and alone.""",2017-11-09,"Sophie and Lavendar attend Hetrick-Martin Institute's 2017 'Pride Is' Emery Awards at Cipriani Wall Street on November 6, 2017 in New York City.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0514a11f00003b004a51cb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"“It’s a little bit like waking up from a dream – or a nightmare – and realizing… you never really shut your eyes.” That is how one teenager here at HMI describes what the last year has felt like under what she describes as the “New Regime.”That is why, now—more than ever—we need places like HMI. That is why now—more than ever—we must embrace the notion of PRIDE in ourselves while helping our LGBTQ youth to feel the same.This past Monday, November 6th, HMI had an opportunity to celebrate its annual “Emery Awards Gala.” This event is meant to be a night of celebration and joy. This year, however, it was filled with messages of “resistance” and “resilience.” For some people it served as an opportunity to regroup; for others to commiserate; and for yet others, it was a chance to recommit to the work at hand. For all attendees though, there was a shared recognition that our community, our country – and our next generation of youth – are depending upon us.The Emery’s this year focused on “Pride is…” and all that the word embodies and means to us.Pride. A short, simple word—that when felt can sustain a life… and when absent… can make us feel helpless and alone.Now, more than ever, we MUST as a community feel Pride: Pride for who we are as a person—as a people—as a community—as a movement.After all… isn’t that what our young people expect from us? And isn’t that what our young people deserve?As we enter a time of year filled with self-reflection and introspection, it seems that this year was filled with far more low points than high ones. We experienced the loss of great LGBTQ leaders who had personal and powerful relationships with our HMI team and the thousands of young people we serve. First, Gilbert Baker, who created the iconic rainbow flag which proudly and sometimes defiantly represents us as a people. Gilbert visited our youth many times and with each visit our youth were enraptured and renewed in their resolve to be “loud and proud.”And then there is the indomitable Edie Windsor. All who were blessed to meet Edie saw not only what it means to feel pride—but to embody it. Edie lived her life unabashedly and in doing so, showed each of us that we MUST do the same. Edie was beloved by all our young people.In acknowledging these two heroes, we must also remember others in the HMI Family whom we have lost. Unfortunately, PRIDE is neither accessible to—nor shared by—everyone. This past year, six young lives within the HMI Community ended far too soon—whether to suicide or violence. With vitriol emanating from the highest levels of our government this past year, enabling young people to experience the right to feel Proud of who they are has become a call to action that we as adults must safeguard vigilantly.At the Emery’s this year there were three honorees. The first was the late Kevyn Aucoin whose legacy, like Gilbert’s and Edie’s, lives on. Kevyn’s light brought joy to many, and he empowered LGBTQ youth through his dedicated support of HMI, and he continues to inspire our young people.HMI also recognized Oath, a media company that unites us as a community and carries the voices of our youth across the globe. Now, as our civil liberties are under attack, we are even more keenly aware and grateful for Oath’s work in helping connecting young people who have historically sought out our country as a bastion of liberty and freedom. Having Oath as a partner inspires feelings of loyalty, and even resistance, on a far greater scale then in the past.HMI is grateful for their invitations to join them on “Huff Post Live” and share our stories (now feeling like our plights) so that the world could reflect upon the impact hatred has had on our nation’s most vulnerable; their employees participation in our volunteer days; and their highly personalized youth videos which—with their artistry woven throughout each youth story—take on a new gravitas that feels life-saving in this moment.And while messages from Washington have focused on diminishing the promise of equality and threatening the existence of spaces to live our lives authentically, here in New York City, the resistance found a bastion of hope in local government leaders like our Mayor, our City’s First Lady and HMI’s third honoree— Melissa Mark-Viverito, Speaker of the New York City Council. Through her unwavering support of our city council initiative, “HMI GOES CITYWIDE FOR LGBTQ YOUTH”—created in partnership with the City Council LGBT Caucus and championed by Council Member Carlos Menchaca—the work of HMI has been able to expand to all corners of our city and has enabled government to help shift the way LGBTQ youth are served.Our Speaker placed her trust in HMI and as our ally, provided unwavering and unyielding support for our work because she FULLY UNDERSTANDS how critical it is that all New Yorkers—and all people—feel proud to be who they are and to know they have full access to all the incredible opportunities afforded them here in New York City, the greatest city on earth.As I conclude, I must also say that Pride Is You. If a society is judged by how it cares for its most vulnerable and at-risk—or as I like to say, its most “at-promise”—citizens, then the notion and action of PRIDE cannot happen without you, the reader, being actively engaged in making it so. The fact that you are reading this piece demonstrates that you not only “get it,” but are willing to do something about it—even when the world beyond us is telling us otherwise.Showing up—and standing up—for the next generation is what PRIDE is really all about. This is the PRIDE we must embrace. This is the PRIDE we must continue to celebrate and—most importantly—share with our nation’s young people.See more photos below."

The Legal Services for Homeless Veterans Act would vastly expand access to justice for millions of veterans facing civil legal challenges by making lawyers available at VA medical centers where many veterans receive their healthcare.I am part of a team of lawyers that provides civil legal aid to veterans through legal clinics conducted onsite at VA hospitals in New York. I have seen the enormous difference legal help can make in veterans’ health. Compared to the civilian population, veterans are at increased risk of homelessness, are more likely to experience disabilities and poor health, and women veterans are more likely to have been victims of sexual assault; legal problems bear on all of these social ills. According to a 2017 VA survey, four of the top ten unmet needs for homeless veterans involve legal problems.With a staff of just five attorneys funded by private foundations and firms, the LegalHealth Veterans Initiative will serve nearly 1,000 veterans this year in VA medical centers’ behavioral health, geriatrics, and women’s health clinics. Working closely with veterans’ healthcare providers, these “medical-legal partnership” clinics will reduce veteran homelessness by preventing evictions, expand access to needed veterans’ services by upgrading bad paper discharges, and stabilize incomes for veterans with significant health needs.VA hospitals—part of the fabric of the veteran community, and places where many low-income and disabled veterans receive their healthcare—have been perfect homes for our clinics, and with sufficient funding other VAs could develop similar partnerships. The VA has helped to establish (through non-VA funding) 17 medical-legal partnerships at VA medical centers. But the vast majority of the VA’s 168 medical centers do not have an onsite attorney to help sick veterans.Deployed around the country, VA medical-legal partnerships could improve health and reduce homelessness for veterans. A recent report prepared for the New York City Bar Association found that providing attorneys to tenants facing eviction would reduce homelessness, along with medical, shelter, and law enforcement costs—and ultimately save the City money. The case is so compelling, in fact, that the City recently passed a law that mandates providing a free attorneys in housing court for eligible low-income tenants. Yet the potential benefits go well beyond housing: the World Health Organization’s seminal study on the social determinants of health presented clear evidence of the relationship between socioeconomic disadvantage and poor health, and the American Academy of Suicidology lists legal difficulties as events that can increase the risk of suicide.By reducing veterans’ legal challenges and increasing their incomes—by securing veterans’ benefits, increasing workplace accommodations for veterans with disabilities, and stabilizing family law issues—we can help to improve veterans’ quality of life and impact their health.To be sure, medical-legal partnerships are not the only way to provide civil legal aid to veterans, and VA funding for veterans legal services would not completely solve the enormous problems of veteran homelessness, benefits backlogs, and suicide. The Act would merely authorize the VA Secretary to fund civil legal aid for veterans, and the Secretary would be free to experiment with different models of service delivery. Moreover, the initial pilot program would likely be small, and additional funds—from city and state governments, private foundations and laws firms, and the federal Legal Services Corporation—would be needed if we are to meet all of the legal needs of veterans.The Department of Veterans Affairs’ motto—taken from President Abraham Lincoln’s Second Inaugural address—is “[T]o care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow, and his orphan.” A great deal has been written about our failure to care for our veterans by not providing them the best possible healthcare through the VA health system—and progress has been made on that front. But we cannot pretend that quality healthcare for veterans in crisis does not include helping with their legal problems. This Veterans Day, Congress should enact the Legal Services for Homeless Veterans Act so that our veterans do not have to face homelessness and health decline as a result of preventable and fixable legal challenges. There could be no greater way to honor those who have served."

Music programs in schools have been proven to keep students engaged in the classroom; improve early cognitive development, math and reading skills; develop critical thinking skills; and foster confidence among students, according to the National Association of Music Merchants.But despite the lasting impact music education has on students, many children in low-income communities still don’t have access to it. That’s why Calloway and the board members and team behind VH1 Save The Music Foundation have been working to bring music programs to underserved schools. Since the nonprofit was founded in 1997, VH1 Save The Music Foundation has allotted grants to more than 2,000 public schools in 42 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. These grants have benefited more than 2 million kids. Recently, students in Newark, New Jersey, and Berkeley and Jefferson Counties in West Virginia received $45,000 worth of musical equipment from the program. Chiho Feindler, senior director of programs and policy, said the foundation has not only benefitted students and their communities by bringing marching bands and orchestras to their cities, but also by improving graduation rates and reducing absenteeism.″[Rewards vary from] a student telling us that in his home life, it’s just such a chaos that being able to play flute on his stoop for his young siblings just brings a peace into his home to better graduation rates to the student who’s now interning to go to college studying music education,” Feindler said. “Stuff like that and just ... giving them the reasons to thrive.”She added that the nonprofit is looking to give schools tech grants in the near future as well.Calloway, who hosted VH1 Save The Music Foundation’s 20th Anniversary Gala in October, said that it’s especially necessary for children today to have a creative outlet that they can lean on during times of trauma. “I think it’s therapeutic for a lot of kids to learn how to play instruments and give you a chance to vent, give you a chance to release some of the dark energy that we’re all surrounded by right now,” he said. “I think music just allows another way to escape it or another way to process it.”“And a lot of times, we feel bad in a day and we put on our favorite music to make us feel better. And so imagine if you’re somebody who can make the music,” he continued. “You and others feel better so it’s just extremely gratifying. I think it helps our kids therapeutically, I think it helps our kids intellectually and not only that, it’s fun to do.”Learn more about VH1 Save The Music Foundation by visiting its website."

Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) introduced legislation Wednesday night that would open a portion of a pristine wildlife refuge in her state to oil and gas development, a move expected to bring in slightly more than $1 billion in federal revenue over the next decade.The bill would open up part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), described by some as “America’s Serengeti,” which covers more than 19 million acres in northeastern Alaska. The region is home to polar bears, caribou, moose and hundreds of species of migratory birds. It’s considered one of the state’s crown jewels.In a statement, Murkowski called it “a tremendous opportunity” for the country.“The legislation ... will put Alaska and the entire nation on a path toward greater prosperity by creating jobs, keeping energy affordable for families and businesses, generating new wealth, and strengthening our security — while reducing the federal deficit not just by $1 billion over ten years, but tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars over the decades to come,” she said.The bill comes just days after Murkowski, who chairs the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, held a hearing to discuss allowing oil and gas production in the refuge’s 1.5 million-acre coastal plain, also known as the 1002 Area. The Senate budget plan includes a provision that requires the committee to find $1 billion in additional revenue over the next decade to help pay for tax reform.Murkowski said the Congressional Budget Office estimates the ANWR legislation would raise $1.092 billion over the next 10 years from the sale of leasing rights.The legislation requires just a simple 51-vote majority, rather than the 60 typically needed to avoid a filibuster, to pass in the Senate because it is part of Congress’ 2018 budget plan, which is being considered under special “reconciliation” provisions. Efforts by Democrats to bar such a bill from moving forward were voted down by almost every Senate Republican last month.In 1980, with the passage of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, Congress expanded ANWR but opted not to give wilderness status to the 1002 Area, setting it aside for potential oil and gas development. Granting leases for that purpose, however, requires an act of Congress. During last week’s hearing, Murkowski said Alaskans have waited decades for the right technologies to come along in order to ensure the environment would remain protected. And she swung back at accusations that she and other Alaska lawmakers are putting short-term economic gains over environmental protection“This is not a choice between energy and the environment,” she said. “We are past that.”As written, the bill would require Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to approve at least two lease sales — each no less than 400,000 acres — in the first 10 years. The first sale would be required within four years, with the second having to be finalized within seven years. The royalties from those sales would be split in half between the state of Alaska and the federal government. The bill allows for 2,000 acres of the coastal plain to be developed with wells and support facilities.Opening the refuge is also on the Trump administration’s wish list. In May, Zinke signed an order to “jump-start Alaskan energy production.” He said at the time that the move was an “important first step in a smart and measured approach to energy development in ANWR.” Additionally, the administration’s 2018 fiscal year budget calls for allowing oil and gas production in the coastal plain. While Murkowski and the administration are confident about the economic benefits that would come from drilling in the refuge, their estimates have been highly disputed. Adam Kolton, executive director of the Alaska Wilderness League, said in a statement Wednesday that “nothing in this bill can magically make these fantastical revenue assumptions materialize.”“What this bill would do is turn America’s last great wilderness into a lost wilderness,” Kolton said. “Senator Lisa Murkowski had promised some kind of new and improved directional drilling, but that’s just a talking point. What we got was simply misdirection and deception. The fact is that the entire 1.5 million acres could be offered up in two massive lease sales.”Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), the committee’s ranking minority member, was among many Democrats last week who blasted the idea of drilling in the unspoiled Arctic landscape. “If you want to open up the Arctic refuge, you should just admit you’re going to destroy the wildlife refuge,” Cantwell said. Environmentalists have said moves to open up such a pristine part of the country to energy companies represent an assault on American conservation.“This is a really big deal,” Niel Lawrence, Alaska director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, told The New York Times in September. “This is a frontal attack in an ideological battle. The Arctic is the holy grail.”A committee hearing on Murkowski’s bill is scheduled for Nov. 15. "

It’s considered one of the state’s crown jewels.In a statement, Murkowski called it “a tremendous opportunity” for the country.“The legislation ... will put Alaska and the entire nation on a path toward greater prosperity by creating jobs, keeping energy affordable for families and businesses, generating new wealth, and strengthening our security — while reducing the federal deficit not just by $1 billion over ten years, but tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars over the decades to come,” she said.The bill comes just days after Murkowski, who chairs the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, held a hearing to discuss allowing oil and gas production in the refuge’s 1.5 million-acre coastal plain, also known as the 1002 Area. The Senate budget plan includes a provision that requires the committee to find $1 billion in additional revenue over the next decade to help pay for tax reform.Murkowski said the Congressional Budget Office estimates the ANWR legislation would raise $1.092 billion over the next 10 years from the sale of leasing rights.The legislation requires just a simple 51-vote majority, rather than the 60 typically needed to avoid a filibuster, to pass in the Senate because it is part of Congress’ 2018 budget plan, which is being considered under special “reconciliation” provisions. Efforts by Democrats to bar such a bill from moving forward were voted down by almost every Senate Republican last month.In 1980, with the passage of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, Congress expanded ANWR but opted not to give wilderness status to the 1002 Area, setting it aside for potential oil and gas development. Granting leases for that purpose, however, requires an act of Congress. During last week’s hearing, Murkowski said Alaskans have waited decades for the right technologies to come along in order to ensure the environment would remain protected. And she swung back at accusations that she and other Alaska lawmakers are putting short-term economic gains over environmental protection“This is not a choice between energy and the environment,” she said. “We are past that.”As written, the bill would require Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to approve at least two lease sales — each no less than 400,000 acres — in the first 10 years. The first sale would be required within four years, with the second having to be finalized within seven years. The royalties from those sales would be split in half between the state of Alaska and the federal government. The bill allows for 2,000 acres of the coastal plain to be developed with wells and support facilities.Opening the refuge is also on the Trump administration’s wish list. In May, Zinke signed an order to “jump-start Alaskan energy production.” He said at the time that the move was an “important first step in a smart and measured approach to energy development in ANWR.” Additionally, the administration’s 2018 fiscal year budget calls for allowing oil and gas production in the coastal plain. While Murkowski and the administration are confident about the economic benefits that would come from drilling in the refuge, their estimates have been highly disputed. Adam Kolton, executive director of the Alaska Wilderness League, said in a statement Wednesday that “nothing in this bill can magically make these fantastical revenue assumptions materialize.”“What this bill would do is turn America’s last great wilderness into a lost wilderness,” Kolton said. “Senator Lisa Murkowski had promised some kind of new and improved directional drilling, but that’s just a talking point. What we got was simply misdirection and deception. The fact is that the entire 1.5 million acres could be offered up in two massive lease sales.”Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), the committee’s ranking minority member, was among many Democrats last week who blasted the idea of drilling in the unspoiled Arctic landscape. “If you want to open up the Arctic refuge, you should just admit you’re going to destroy the wildlife refuge,” Cantwell said. Environmentalists have said moves to open up such a pristine part of the country to energy companies represent an assault on American conservation.“This is a really big deal,” Niel Lawrence, Alaska director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, told The New York Times in September. “This is a frontal attack in an ideological battle. The Arctic is the holy grail.”A committee hearing on Murkowski’s bill is scheduled for Nov. 15. "
38,BLACK VOICES,Jenifer Lewis: A No-Holds-Barred Interview With 'The Mother Of Black Hollywood',"Dustin Fitzharris, ContributorJournalist in New York",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jenifer-lewis-a-no-holds-barred-interview-with-the_us_5a03a290e4b055de8d096a72,"The ""Black-ish"" star opens up about her new book.",2017-11-09,<p>“The Mother of Black Hollywood” — Jenifer Lewis</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a03a3ed1c00002800b33f86.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I have to admit, I had no idea what to expect as I dialed Jenifer Lewis' number for our interview. Sure, every time I watch one of her videos on Instagram I laugh like a fool, but our talk wasn’t for an audience. Lewis didn't need to earn a standing ovation or a rave review.In her remarkable career that has spanned more than four decades, Lewis has proven she is a force of nature who knows how to entertain. However, after reading her memoir, The Mother of Black Hollywood, available November 14, I learned of the sadness that was once buried inside her over-the-top personality.At 33 years old, Lewis entered therapy and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. In her book, Lewis candidly opened up about her journey through the pain, which today has been replaced by joy.Within minutes of talking to Lewis, who currently stars on the ABC comedy black-ish, I knew I would have to write this article the way it happened. The range of emotions Lewis shared could not be chopped up into a few quotes. After a half hour of laughing and sharing each other's stories, I felt as if I had made a new friend. That’s the magic of Jenifer Lewis. I can't help but think we'll talk again.DUSTIN FITZHARRIS: Hello, Ms. Lewis.JENIFER LEWIS: Hey, baby, how you doin'? So who the fuck are you? Dustin, right?FITZHARRIS: That's me.LEWIS: Baby, what'cha want with your girl this morning? You want an interview? Let's hit it!FITZHARRIS: First, I have to tell you how much I loved the book.LEWIS: Did you read it, really?FITZHARRIS: Of course. Cover to cover. LEWIS: Get out!FITZHARRIS: I was on the plane going to Las Vegas, and a woman who saw me reading the book said to me, “I didn’t even know that was out yet.” I felt like a big star or something and said, “It’s not.”LEWIS: Oh, that’s hysterical. (I suddenly recalled a story from the book about a TV journalist who said to Lewis that her earrings weren't real. You'll have to read the book to find out who it was.) FITZHARRIS: And I want you to know I'm not going to say your earrings aren't real!LEWIS: That bitch! On the air! FITZHARRIS: And the story in the book of you working at McDonald's was hilarious.LEWIS: Those fuckin' buns!FITZHARRIS: You know, I have been singing that rap you did on Instagram for your book non-stop. LEWIS: Listen, here's how it happened. I had done 12 hours on black-ish. I was exhausted. I came in my house, and there were two drag queens there. I mean, who else would be there? There was DJ [“Shangela” Pierce] and some other drag queen. Adorable. They had done one [a rap] 'For the Chicken.' Then they showed me Erykah Badu doing one ""For the ‘D.’ I said, ""Well, fuck y'all. I'm going to sleep."" Then they came to the stairs and said, ""Oh, Miss Lewis, do one for your book."" I said, ""Okay you little muthafuckers, give me that pig and that goddamn plate. Come on!"" FITZHARRIS: Do you write these songs in advance you put on Instagram or do they just come to you?LEWIS: Child, they just come to the top my head. Whatever I'm feeling. That fuckin' I don't want nobody fuckin’ with me in these streets came from that con-artist shit. (Lewis met an LA Fitness employee who she says conned her out of $50,000.) It came from that police brutality shit. That shit just came out of me that night. FITZHARRIS: And how did Brandy and Roz Ryan get in the video for “In These Streets?” LEWIS: I had gone to see Brandy and Roz in Chicago. I went backstage, you know, like a big movie star. I said, ""Oh, the show was fabulous. You all come over for dinner. I know how it is on the road--you want a home-cooked meal."" Well, I didn't mean it! Those muthafuckers come! I was like, ""Bitch, there ain't nothing in here to eat!"" FITZHARRIS: So you just sang?LEWIS: Don't be ridiculous. Roz cooked that night. It was delicious. I'll never forget that meal as long as I live. It's probably because of that meal that whole thing came out of us and 45 million views later. So Brandy kept walking around my house looking at my artwork, and I would hear her say something about a street. You know, I'm 60. I don't know anything about in these streets. Then she went into the refrigerator at one point and said something about in these streets. I got sick of it and said, ""Bitch, what the fuck are you talking about! What kind of street is in the fuckin' refrigerator?"" She looked at me and said, ""Oh, Auntie, it's just something I say."" I said, ""Y'all come over here and let's make up a song about it."" FITZHARRIS: Then there was a video with Todrick Hall where he referred to Brandy as a legend. You went off on him. You said, “I’m the legend!” Do you consider yourself a legend? LEWIS: You know, look, that's something somebody else says about you. I consider myself as somebody who gave back. I gave it back. I was gifted at birth with this talent, and I've tried to honor it all my life. And I did---through hell and storms and tsunamis and earthquakes. I've been through too much not to know that giving back is everything. FITZHARRIS: In high school your nickname was ""killer."" In college people referred to you as ""majestic."" Today people call you ""diva."" How do you describe yourself? LEWIS: Oh, shit. That's such a funny question. I can't describe myself. I'm fuckin' everything! FITZHARRIS: You’re every woman like Chaka Khan.LEWIS: Chaka Khan! I’m every---now listen, fool, I'm supposed to be in a class. What'cha want? FITZHARRIS: Well, we have to talk about the book, The Mother of Black Hollywood. Did you always know you had a book in you?LEWIS: Yes, I've been keeping a journal since I was in the seventh grade. Day to day you must understand. When I entered therapy, my therapist said that was probably what saved my life---that I was able to get my feelings down on paper. FITZHARRIS: Keeping a journal is---LEWIS: Oh, my god, I'm looking at a Hibiscus now. I don't even know how to describe this color. It's like orange and red. I'm down here at Lemon Grove, California at The Optimum Health Institute. I'm getting myself real healthy before I go on this book tour, child. FITZHARRIS: And I know you're coming to New York for the tour. You moved to New York at 22 years old. If you could go back, what would you say to your 22-year-old self? LEWIS: That's interesting. I don't think I'd say anything to her. I think I would just hold her and rock her. I would probably just go, ""Shhhh ... you're okay, baby. Everything is going to be fine."" I would love her. I would physically, mentally and spiritually just hold her. I wish to God somebody would have done that for me. But I hid the pain back in those days. Nobody knew I had a sex addiction. FITZHARRIS: You were very revealing about sex in your book. LEWIS: Oh, honey, they came from the far corners of the world. It was dangerous. It was self-medicating, but we didn't have those words back then. Now go on. FITZHARRIS: And you've had a few boyfriends in your life. What have you learned about love?LEWIS: Wow. Amazing you'd ask that question. I'm so in love with life right now that it's kind of stupid. I really got myself together. I'm in my skin. I came through the fire, baby. I came through that bitch. FITZHARRIS: It seems like you are in the best place you've ever been in your life. LEWIS: I am, darling. I feel so good now. I get up now, and I just can't wait to see the color fuchsia. My girlfriend called me one day and asked what I was doing. I said, ""Do you really want to know?"" I told her I was driving around in search of the color fuchsia. I know it's dramatic. It's all of that stuff. FITZHARRIS: You have such an impressive body of work in your career, but are there any performances of yours that you would say to aspiring performers, ""Watch this, bitches?""LEWIS: That's funny. I think my performance in What's Love Got to Do With It was powerful. I was so unafraid and confident. You know, it was the first mother of black Hollywood. I was Tina Turner's mama. That's what started it all. I had fallen in love right before that movie, and I had absolutely no fear in me. FITZHARRIS: And now here we are with black-ish and you’re playing another mother. How are you different from your character Ruby Johnson?LEWIS: Well, Ruby is insane! I have a lot of Ruby in me, of course. But I don't have Ruby's politics. I'm far from Ruby. I have her sass and her loving ways, but that's about the end of it for Ruby. Ruby is crazy as hell. I'm easy now. I'm walking through an herb garden right now, Dustin. I walk in a state of gratitude. I walk in a state of appreciation. I sang down at the Women's March with Brandy. That's who I am now. I mean, come on, bitches, let's get up. FITZHARRIS: Do you have a mantra every morning?LEWIS: After I brush my teeth and wipe my mouth, I look at myself and say, ""You pretty bitch."" Then I keep it moving. I say, ""Go get 'em tiger."" It's not easy, but you've got to fight for your right. I never thought I'd be using this phrase, but the pursuit of happiness--that's my right. That's very powerful to pursue happiness every fucking day because you don't know when it's your last. That's why I'm in this herb garden. I walk in my joy, baby. You roll up on me, you're going to leave laughing--unless you've got some ugly shit on you. Usually people with ugly shit on them can't even get near me. You roll up on Jenifer Lewis the wrong way, you will blow a fucking fuse. You'll get zapped because I walk in my joy. With all that I've been given, I've got to give it back now. FITZHARRIS: You gave a lot back in the book.LEWIS: That's why I wrote this book for the millennials. Here's my story. Here's my song. Now you lie down and get up. Stand up. Let's resist these forces that will take away the fucking air for your great-grandchildren to breathe. You stand your ass up and resist this bullshit. Let's keep it moving and while we're at it, let's sing some happy fucking songs---and skip, bitch.FITZHARRIS: I really need to meet you in person.LEWIS: Shit, you don't have to. I'm giving you a 10-hour show this morning. I'm going to charge you.FITZHARRIS: This has been so much fun. LEWIS: All right, now get out of here. Let me get to class. You're an angel. FITZHARRIS: I'm sending you love.LEWIS: Right back at you, Dustin. And let me tell you something before I hang up. You know, you guys always compliment me and send me love and you tell me how wonderful you think I am. Now I'm going to say this to you. It has to be in you to see it in me. You take that with you.FITZHARRIS: Thank you.LEWIS: Be good, babycake.Jenifer Lewis' memoir, “The Mother of Black Hollywood,” is available Nov. 14.

Like clockwork, at the end of the night, the leftovers are divvied up and you’re sent packing with your host’s valuable food storage containers bearing enough cranberry sauce or popovers to feed you for the week to come. Instead, impress your host and make Thanksgiving less wasteful by bringing your own leftover containers. Bringing your own plastic or glass food containers not only saves your host on clean-up and refrigeration space, but it also allows them to not dole out their own food storage sets because you brought your own.Ask your host ahead of time if they really need that side of healthy mashed potatoes you were planning to bring.

Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-manafort-bail-phone-company-florida_us_5a047884e4b03deac08bc166,"The former Trump campaign manager says he's working with a company developing secure, virtually indestructible phones. That's questionable.",2017-11-09,"Kathleen Manafort tries to put a credential on her husband, Paul Manafort, at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, July 17, 2016. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a04794c1b00004800376505.jpeg?cache=hdH0pyiZsj&ops=crop_60_549_3440_1765%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― A lawyer for Paul Manafort, the former Donald Trump campaign manager who was indicted on federal charges last week, told a judge on Monday that Manafort is working with a company in Florida that’s developing secure, “virtually indestructible” cellphones. But the owner of Hoyos Integrity ― the telecommunications company that Manafort’s lawyer appears to have been referring to ― told HuffPost that Manafort hasn’t been associated with the business for months.Manafort, who surrendered to the FBI last week after he was indicted on 12 federal charges, is currently on house arrest in Virginia with a GPS monitor on his left ankle. He’s trying to reach a bail agreement with prosecutors working for special counsel Robert Mueller that could relax some of his pretrial conditions. Manafort is hoping he’ll be able to travel to New York and Florida, where he also has homes.As an international consultant, he’s got a pretty decent business excuse for traveling to New York, which is where he sees clients. But finding a business-related reason to convince a judge to allow Manafort to travel to Florida ― where it was 83 degrees and sunny on Thursday ― is a bit tricky.Kevin Downing, Manafort’s attorney, told U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson at a hearing about bail on Monday that Manafort needed to travel to Florida because he does “quite a bit of work” in Fort Lauderdale. There, Downing said, Manafort has “got a business” that is “developing secure cellphones” that are “relatively or virtually indestructible.”Downing hasn’t responded to multiple requests from HuffPost for additional details on the business. But the company he was referring to appears to be Hoyos Integrity, which is run by Manafort’s longtime friend Hector Hoyos.Hoyos Integrity matches up with the details of the company described in court. It has an office in Fort Lauderdale. It says it’s developing a “complete secure smartphone” that is “impenetrable” and “impervious to hacking.” Manafort was affiliated with a previous iteration of the company, and was temporarily listed as director earlier this year, as Politico reported in June. A business report for that company, filed before it morphed into Hoyos Integrity, lists Manafort’s name as director alongside the names of Hoyos Integrity’s current CEO, general counsel, chief financial officer and senior vice president of engineering. Here’s the problem: Manafort’s friend Hector Hoyos, executive chairman and chief technology officer of Hoyos Integrity, says Manafort hasn’t been associated with the company in months. Hoyos said he has “no idea” what Manafort’s lawyer was referring to in court on Monday.“Insofar as my company is concerned, Hoyos Integrity, he was a consultant of ours, but he’s not any longer,” Hoyos told HuffPost. “He has no relationship with us in any way, shape or form.”There are a couple of other possible explanations for the claim Downing made in court. Maybe, while under a federal investigation that included a no-knock raid on his home, Manafort was able to form his own company, also based in Fort Lauderdale, that did basically the same thing as Hoyos Integrity, all without leaving a paper trail. Or maybe another Fort Lauderdale-based company that was also working on secure, virtually indestructible cellphones decided it would be a good idea to hire a man who was under federal investigation.The second possibility, in fact, isn’t completely implausible. Both Hoyos and Frank Tobin, the CEO of Hoyos Integrity, told HuffPost that there might be other companies in Fort Lauderdale working on secure phones. There used to be a Motorola facility nearby.“Google is there, a lot of companies are there,” Hoyos said.“I’m sure there’s probably some more in Fort Lauderdale,” Tobin said.But neither man knew anything about Manafort working for other companies. “Paul has a lot of different businesses, and I’m not privy to what they are,” Hoyos said.But perhaps the more likely theory, based on Manafort’s history, is that Manafort is misleading his lawyer and the court. After all, the special counsel successfully fought to compel Manafort’s former attorney to testify before a grand jury, using the testimony to charge Manafort with lying to the federal government about his work for Ukraine.Downing did not respond to multiple requests for comment this week. A spokesman for the special counsel declined to comment on whether prosecutors were under the impression that Manafort is still working with Hoyos Integrity, or whether they were aware of the name of the company Manafort’s lawyer was referring to (if one exists). Manafort owns a home about an hour north of Fort Lauderdale, in Palm Beach Gardens. Manafort’s team, which offered up the property as part of his bail package, claimed it was worth $1.5 million, while the special counsel team thinks it is worth closer to $1.25 million.At the court hearing on Monday, a lawyer for the special counsel team said they believed they were “getting close” to reaching a bail agreement with Manafort’s team, but would need a bit more time. The special counsel team believes that Manafort’s team is overvaluing Manafort’s Trump Tower condo, which Manafort’s team claims is worth $6 million. The special counsel team found estimates that said it’s worth less than $3 million. Manafort and his wife, as it happens, have a $3 million mortgage on the condo, so it’s possible the property itself is worth less than the mortgage on it.Hoyos, whose daughter is Manafort’s godchild, publicly revealed that he had cut business ties with Manafort long before the court appearance on Monday. Hoyos spoke with The New York Times for a story published after Manafort’s indictment last week in which he said Manafort was “sad” when Hoyos said they had to end their business relationship. Hoyos said Manafort apologized to him for creating problems.Hoyos told HuffPost he’d be friends with Manafort “in good times and bad times” ― but business, he said, is a different story.“One tries to keep friendship and business separate,” Hoyos said. “The reality is that things one has to do in business affect the friendship.”Ryan Reilly is HuffPost’s senior justice reporter, covering criminal justice, federal law enforcement and legal affairs.

And they are furious about what they consider to be a soft sentencing.“Four years for taking someone’s life? No way,” Viafore’s mother, Mary Anne Viafore, told reporters. “Justice was not served for my son.”In court, Viafore’s sister also had urged the judge to lock Graswald away for a much longer term.“My brother did not deserve to have his life end this way,” Laura Rice said, according to the Poughkeepsie Journal. “Our family feels Angelika should be held accountable for the actions she has admitted to … a short, four-year-sentence does not seem just. Serving a portion of that sentence seems even more unjust.”Graswald, who was initially charged with Viafore’s murder, pleaded guilty to criminally negligent homicide in July.Authorities said she admitted to removing a plug from Viafore’s kayak before they went into the water. She also said that she knew one of his paddles was missing a locking clip, that he wasn’t wearing a life vest or wetsuit, and that their trip along the river was during dangerously low temperatures and rough water.Viafore’s boat capsized, but instead of quickly calling for help, prosecutors said Graswald waited for him to drown.

And they are furious about what they consider to be a soft sentencing.“Four years for taking someone’s life? No way,” Viafore’s mother, Mary Anne Viafore, told reporters. “Justice was not served for my son.”In court, Viafore’s sister also had urged the judge to lock Graswald away for a much longer term.“My brother did not deserve to have his life end this way,” Laura Rice said, according to the Poughkeepsie Journal. “Our family feels Angelika should be held accountable for the actions she has admitted to … a short, four-year-sentence does not seem just. Serving a portion of that sentence seems even more unjust.”Graswald, who was initially charged with Viafore’s murder, pleaded guilty to criminally negligent homicide in July.Authorities said she admitted to removing a plug from Viafore’s kayak before they went into the water. She also said that she knew one of his paddles was missing a locking clip, that he wasn’t wearing a life vest or wetsuit, and that their trip along the river was during dangerously low temperatures and rough water.Viafore’s boat capsized, but instead of quickly calling for help, prosecutors said Graswald waited for him to drown.

44,ARTS & CULTURE,Kehinde Wiley Was Destined To Paint Barack Obama,Priscilla Frank,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kehinde-wiley-barack-obama_us_59ee3e04e4b0d8293cabdfa0,"As one of his last presidential acts, Obama chose a queer, black artist as his official portraitist. Wiley's colleagues and peers explain why the choice was fated.",2017-11-09,The existing halls of the National Portrait Gallery's presidential wing.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a01ee801400003001d7f46a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"The presidential portraits wing of the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery is lined with paintings of very powerful and equally pasty men. Its walls, filled with bowties, powder wigs and pursed lips, speak two well-known truths at once: Both the history of American politics and the history of Western art are blindingly white. In 2018, however, the gallery will receive an addition unlike the rest. As was reported earlier this fall, a portrait of former President Barack Obama will join the Smithsonian ranks next year, painted by 40-year-old contemporary art star Kehinde Wiley. As a result, Obama will become the first black president featured in the gallery, and Wiley (along with Amy Sherald, commissioned to paint Michelle Obama), the first black artist to grace its halls.The former president and first lady hand-picked the artists who will render their official portraits. And those decisions hold weight. Antwaun Sargent, a 29-year-old critic who’s covered Wiley extensively, felt personally affected by Obama’s historic choice. “I grew up in Chicago,” he told HuffPost. “I knocked on doors in the dead of winter when Obama was running for Senate. To see him choose an openly queer, black man who has devoted his career to depicting black folks, it’s really full circle for me.” Wiley’s paintings are easy to discern. Their backgrounds typically involve a florid design quietly creeping toward the fore, its composition a melting pot of British Arts and Crafts textiles and Dutch-made African wax prints. Up front is usually a figure ― young, attractive and black ― dressed in contemporary streetwear and mimicking the stances of Old Master heroes like Napoleon Bonaparte or Charles V. Wiley’s painted subjects are often categorized as “normal,” in that they’re not particularly rich or famous, as portrait sitters for Titian or Jacques-Louis David tended to be. Wiley scouts his subjects himself, either on the streets of New York or through open casting calls. Like many artists, Wiley has an appreciation for beauty, but he gravitates toward a lesser documented masculine allure that manifests in hip style, performative swagger, defined muscles, tattoos and radiant black skin.“Sometimes I’d walk through the galleries just to look at the way the faces and the hands are painted, all the nuances of black,” Eugenie Tsai, the Brooklyn Museum curator who organized a 2015 exhibition of Wiley’s work, recalled.Once immortalized in Wiley’s massive, gold-framed canvases (they can measure as large as nine feet tall), his subjects shift from regular people to mythic giants. They ride horses like Napoleon, wield swords like Willem van Heythuysen and pose flamboyantly like Andries Stilte II, all while wearing standard blue jeans and sneakers. Wiley imbues his sitters with a gravitas and glory historically reserved for patrons, nobles and saints. His works build upon the centuries-old relationship between portraiture and power, using the canonized language of art history to exalt a new kind of subject. “He literally is the first person I know of, throughout the history of painting, who is appropriating the entire history of art ― from cave painting on ― and bending it to his will,” Sean Kelly, founder of Sean Kelly Gallery, the gallery that represents Wiley’s work, said. “The whole history of art becomes a narrative about black presence.”Conversations about Wiley’s work often revolve around this one specific aspect: the idea of injecting brown bodies into an all-white canon. As the artist’s straightforward and affecting statement reads: “Painting is about the world that we live in. Black men live in the world. My choice is to include them. This is my way of saying yes to us.” However, Wiley’s paintings are not simply exercises in corrective representation ― making the invisible visible. They are intended to probe the mechanics of seeing and being seen. “Many people see my early work simply as portraits of black and brown people,” Wiley told HuffPost in May. “Really, it’s an investigation of how we see those people and how they have been perceived over time. The performance of black American identity feels very different from actually living in a black body. There’s a dissonance between inside and outside.”Sargent described a similar dissonance between a white mainstream perception of Wiley’s subjects and his subjects’ understandings of themselves. “Kehinde saw something in these people that the larger culture didn’t see,” he said. “He believed they were heroic, that they had power. He painted people the way they imagined themselves, the way society has always ignored.”If conventional Western portraits calcify structural power, Wiley’s are vehicles for empowerment in and of themselves. They exist in the discordant space between assumption, reality and performance, where the self is as wrapped up in artifice as authenticity. There is, therefore, a parallel between how Wiley regards his subjects and how Obama, as a young man, imagined himself.To fête an unlikely subject is “not unlike a black man saying ‘I’m going to run for president’ when everyone is saying ‘no you can’t,’” Sargent said. For Tsai, another overlooked element of Wiley’s work is its queerness. Female beauty has remained a near constant source of inspiration for Western artists, but appreciation of male beauty, especially black male beauty by a black male artist, can still bring a jolt to the system.“Instead of the male gaze ― men looking at women ― you have a sense that this is a man looking at men,” she said. “It’s no secret.”Portraying his subjects with exuberance and a hint of kitsch, Wiley embraces queerness as a lens, challenging the shallow assumptions that often beset young black men. “Wiley doesn’t only challenge the white gaze, but also the cultural gaze and the role of masculinity,” Sargent said. “It’s about black men trying to negotiate gayness in the context of mainstream gay society which has its prejudices. ’If I don’t look this way, or if I don’t act this way, am I gay? Am I black? Can you still see me?’”There is more to Wiley’s work than the goal of diversifying subjects and artists represented in the art world. Yet that initiative ― also undertaken by artists including Kerry James Marshall, the late Barkley Hendricks, Mickalene Thomas, as well as rising artists like Jordan Casteel, Henry Taylor, Njideka Akunyili-Crosby, Toyin Ojih Odutola and many more ― has tangible effects. The Brooklyn Museum’s 2015 mid-career survey of Wiley’s work was wildly popular, drawing around 124,000 visitors over the course of three months. More than the numbers, curator Tsai was struck by the wide range of people entering the museum’s doors: art buffs and kids walking down Eastern Parkway, hip-hop aficionados and local families. “For me, one of the most amazing things about the exhibition was eavesdropping on the conversations going on,” Tsai said. “It made me realize that everyone should have the experience of seeing someone who looks like you hanging on the walls of a cultural institution. You think of an exhibition as the work on the walls, but the interactions between the visitors and the works of art were crucial.” Beyond expanding the scope of museum attendees, Wiley is also helping shape the next generation of collectors. “In the short term, he’s bringing a different audience to the work,” gallerist Kelly put it. “In the long term, he’s broadening the depth of collectors for the work. Kehinde’s work is capable of touching different audiences in different ways, so the collector base is much more diverse.”Kelly speculated that these real-world effects drive Wiley as an artist. “I think after 4,000 years of being excluded from the narrative, he wants to make sure that the next generation of kids walking into a museum don’t have to experience what he did. I think he wants everybody to feel like what they’re looking at represents them and in some way speaks to them.”Wiley grew up in South Central, Los Angeles, with five siblings ― including a twin brother ― and his mother, who worked as a linguist before opening a junk shop in the neighborhood. Wiley was influenced by his mother’s linguistic work, which explored the friction between American Standard English and the black vernacular and code-switching black kids adopt as a method of survival. As an adult, cast in the role of “contemporary black artist,” Wiley is cognizant of the multiple worlds he inhabits and the distinct languages each requires. “It’s about being able to play inside and outside of the race narrative at once,” the San Francisco Art Institute and Yale University School of Art alumnus said. “It’s difficult to get right.”In a 2017 series, Wiley painted prominent black artists as “Tricksters,” fabled master code-switchers, to illustrate their dexterity in mythic terms. Rashid Johnson, an artist featured in the series and a friend of Wiley’s since 2001, described the experience of sitting for Wiley as very organized and comfortable. “I don’t think he changes personalities but he takes on a more directorial position,” he told HuffPost. “It’s Kehinde but a little more serious.”Outside the studio, Wiley’s peers describe him as brilliant, energetic and incredibly present. “He’s one of those people who walks into the room and the temperature changes,” Kelly said. Wiley currently has two running studios ― one in Brooklyn, one in Beijing ― and is building a third in Senegal. The spaces operate like the traditional Renaissance studios of Leonardo or Michelangelo catapulted into a postmodern, 21st-century laboratory, with assistants ushering his large-scale ideas into being. The conceptual work is Wiley’s alone, but the task of painting is divvied up among a number of assistants who’ve mastered his stroke. This studio setup, despite its significant art historical precedent, interrupts the persistent fantasy of the monogamous relationship between artist and artwork. As Wiley explained to GQ’s Wyatt Mason: “The sentiments about authenticity in the public eye, the discomfort with a large-scale art practice, comes from a myth in an artistic process that never existed.”Wiley romanticizes neither the creation of art nor its valuation. “Wiley acknowledges that he makes high-end products to sell,” Tsai said. “It’s partially tongue in cheek, but it’s part of his practice.” The understanding that art is not something precious and invaluable, but in fact, something very valuable, frees Wiley up to exhibit his work outside the typical art world-approved venues. In 2009, Wiley partnered with Puma on a collection of clothing, shoes and accessories incorporating the graphic patterns from his paintings’ backdrops. His work also appears on the set of Fox drama “Empire,” in the gilded apartment of Terrence Howard’s character Lucious Lyon. “We wanted the character to be like a Jay-Z,” set decorator Caroline Perzan said. “So the question was: what would Jay-Z have at his penthouse in New York?” Wiley’s portraits ― flashy, epic, instantly recognizable and widely coveted ― were a perfect choice. Because the selected paintings, including “Officer of the Hussars,” were either hanging in museums or otherwise occupied, Perzan bought the rights to the images, then printed them onto high-quality canvases and framed them. Some star painters might turn their noses up at the thought of their work appearing on the set of a soapy TV show, but Wiley consistently shows how arbitrary and confining the art world’s conventions can be. “I think Kehinde has been really smart about making sure his work has multiple audiences and [isn’t] just locked away in castles and museums where all people don’t have access to it,” Sargent said. “I think that is part of the genius of Kehinde Wiley.”Kelly agreed, recognizing Wiley’s willingness to stir up categories both in his work and with his work. “He is part of a younger generation of artists who are very comfortable moving between high and low culture and across cultural boundaries,” he said. “Take ‘Napoleon Leading the Army over the Alps,’ which has a contemporary kid called Napoleon on a horse in a pair of Puma shoes and a hoodie. Kehinde is prepared to cross all those boundaries and deal with all of those high art transgressions.”Obama’s official portrait, which won’t be revealed until early 2018, will likely not adhere to Wiley’s famed formula. Many of his critics and peers predict it will not feature a vibrant, textile backdrop nor a horse-riding Obama clad with sword or cane. But perhaps more important, Wiley need not adorn Obama with the traditional trappings of privilege and power to help white society grasp the authority he possesses. Obama has already transformed the way white America envisions mastery.In fact, when Obama ran for president in 2008, his image was already iconic, thanks to a ubiquitous stencil portrait by street artist Shepard Fairey. The portrait featured the candidate’s stylized face in patriotic colors, with the word “hope” written underneath. Fairey’s portrait may have defined Obama’s candidacy, but Wiley’s will define his presidency. The pairing is as bold as it is fitting: a young art star in conversation with the entire history of Western art, embracing its norms while broadening its scope. With profound self-awareness, Obama aligns himself with Wiley’s mission of entering a historically white sphere and mastering it as the world takes notice. Nearly a year after a new president was elected, Obama reminds his followers of how he sees himself and how history will remember him. Wiley has described his artistic practice as a “way of saying yes to us” ― the black community, the queer community, all the individuals who aren’t typically memorialized in golden frames. The sentiment echoes Obama’s lyrical motto, “yes we can,” which followed him from his senate campaign in 2004 to his final speech as president in 2017. With his official presidential portrait, Obama manages to convey this message even without words, exuding the radical optimism that he hopes will define his legacy: Yes we can. Yes we did. Yes to us. Yes. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated Wiley’s age as 44."

The survey asked a random sample of 2,016 adults how often they “felt particularly connected to the world around you,” “felt like you were a part of something much larger than yourself,” and “felt a sense of larger meaning or purpose in life.”The survey, conducted between February 28 and March 29, also measured for religiosity based on how often participants attended formal worship services and the degree to which they said religion is important in their lives. The report identified four primary groups of Americans: those who are spiritual and religious; spiritual but not religious; not spiritual but religious; and neither spiritual nor religious.PRRI found that Americans who identify as spiritual and religious or spiritual but not religious express higher life satisfaction than those who are not spiritual. Sixty-one percent of spiritual but not religious Americans and 70 percent of those who are both spiritual and religious report being very or completely satisfied with their lives in general.In contrast, 53 percent of Americans who are not spiritual but religious and 47 percent of those who are neither spiritual nor religious say the same.A similar divide held true when participants were asked to rate their feelings about their health. PRRI found that 53 percent of Americans who are spiritual and religious and 50 percent of those who are spiritual but not religious say they are very or completely satisfied with their personal health. Just 42 percent of Americans who are not spiritual but religious and 37 percent of those who aren’t spiritual or religious report being satisfied with their health.Spiritual respondents also reported spending more time with friends, feeling more gratitude and being more open to doing favors for others than those who are not spiritual.“Americans who are spiritual, regardless of how religious they are, demonstrate a greater proclivity to help others, said PRRI research director Dan Cox in a release. “Americans who are more spiritual are more likely to listen to someone else’s problems, do a personal favor, or even allow a stranger to cut in line.”PRRI also found that a greater percentage of spiritual Americans report feeling inspired while consuming various forms of media than those who aren’t spiritual. The greatest source of such inspiration for both groups was music. Seventy-one percent of spiritual respondents said they felt moved or inspired within the previous week while listening to music. Just 43 percent of nonspiritual Americans reported having the same experience within the week prior to the survey. The relationship between spirituality and happiness has long been a topic of interest among researchers, who generally find that faith promotes life satisfaction by binding people together around a shared or common belief and helping them develop a sense of personal meaning. That could explain why PRRI’s study showed that Americans who are religious but not particularly spiritual are less likely to express life satisfaction than those whose faith is fortified by spiritual experiences like feeling connecting to the world around them and feeling a sense of meaning in life.Clay Routledge, a North Dakota State University psychology professor who studies the relationship between faith and human beings’ search for meaning, said religious affiliation doesn’t necessarily guarantee wellbeing.“Religiosity has long been connected to wellbeing but simply having a religious identity is not necessarily diagnostic of the deeper sense of spirituality that makes one feel meaningful,” Routledge told HuffPost.Religious affiliation also doesn’t ensure that a person feels particularly connected to the faith with which they identify, he added.“Spirituality may be capturing a deeper sense of connection to something that feels personally meaningful, which would also help explain why people who report being both spiritual and religious are most likely to have high life satisfaction,” the professor noted. “These folks have a personal spirituality that is likely connected to a specific meaning-providing religious faith.”"
47,POLITICS,She Has Lived Legally In The U.S. For 19 Years. Now The Trump Administration Wants Her Out.,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tps-honduras-nicaragua_us_5a01e2fce4b0368a4e8748cf,"Maria Elena Hernandez is one of about 5,300 Nicaraguan immigrants set to lose temporary protected status in 2019.",2017-11-08,"Maria Elena Hernandez, a recipient of temporary protected status, with her brother, Jose Vicente, who died last year.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0241c61400003001d7f5a6.jpeg?cache=2axk9XGVNj&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Maria Elena Hernandez, a 58-year-old immigrant from Nicaragua, has lived legally in the United States for 19 years. She has family here that she sees daily and a job as a janitor. She is active in her union and volunteers. Hernandez was at work Monday evening when she received a call from a union organizer who warned that her whole life could soon fall apart. The Trump administration announced that it is ending the temporary protected status that has allowed Hernandez and about 5,300 other Nicaraguan immigrants to remain in the country since 1999. They now have until January 2019 to either find a legal avenue to stay in the country or get out. Hernandez felt betrayed. “I was expecting more empathy, more comprehension of all of the good that we contribute to the economy and to the culture here in this country,” Hernandez said, speaking through an interpreter.There are about 300,000 immigrants living in the U.S. under temporary protected status (TPS), and it will be up to the current administration to determine whether they should be able to stay legally or become targets of President Donald Trump’s deportation efforts. It’s often politically difficult to end protections for people who have lived in the U.S. for years, but Trump did it for Sudanese immigrants with TPS and then again in a separate program for young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. His administration is now weighing whether to do the same for Haitians and Salvadorans, and will soon have to reconsider the fate of Hondurans, whom he granted a six-month extension on Monday. Trump and his officials called on Congress to step in to help those immigrants. But they also put them at risk of being cast out of a country where they’ve lived for years. Hernandez doesn’t plan to stay in the U.S. without legal status, but she doesn’t want to go back to Nicaragua. She came to the U.S. in December 1998 on a tourist visa to visit her brothers and stayed because of instability at home. Nicaragua was designated for TPS in January 1999, after Hurricane Mitch devastated the country the previous year. Hernandez applied for TPS and has renewed it multiple times in the years since. She put down roots, like most other TPS recipients have. She lives with family, including two of her brothers, in an apartment in Plantation, Florida. The family is “always together,” she said, going to church or the beach, or having Sunday dinners.Leaving them would be particularly painful after their third brother died of cancer last November, Hernandez said. She called her brothers her “reason to live.” “I already lost one brother, and the idea of being separated from them makes me feel so sad,” she said, adding later, “Just with the death of my brother we all feel a great loss as if there’s a part of our body that’s missing.” Hernandez and her late brother used to work together at a local college, where she is still a janitor. She was active in helping them fight for raises and better benefits as a member of the 32BJ SEIU, a local of the Service Employees International Union.When she found out about the TPS decision on Monday evening, one of her U.S. citizen co-workers said they would all fight together to help her stay.The first step will be to visit a lawyer to determine whether she has legal options. Although she has family members who are U.S. citizens, the sponsorship process is slow and there might not be enough time.Her best bet is for Congress to pass a bill granting her and other TPS recipients permanent legal status. The Trump administration and other TPS critics have argued the program is not meant to provide long-term status and that it should be ended if the country is no longer suffering from the situation that led to the protected status.Hernandez said the situation is “not fine” in Nicaragua or in Honduras, which received a six-month extension by default because the administration failed to come to a decision about whether to extend it.The United States “is supposed to be a leader in human rights and a country that critiques other countries for failing to respect human rights like the countries that we come from,” she said.“How is it possible that they could then turn around and send us back to these countries?”"

Embarrassing!,2017-11-08,President Donald Trump got a thumbs down from the American Bar Association on another one of his judicial nominees.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0246ce1400002000d7f5aa.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump’s pick for an Alabama district court seat, Brett Talley, is “not qualified” to be a federal judge, says the American Bar Association.The ABA announced its unanimous rating on Tuesday evening.Talley, who is an assistant deputy attorney general at the Justice Department, is Trump’s fourth judicial nominee to receive the terrible and rarely designated rating by the nation’s top legal group. That’s a huge number of a president’s court picks to get the thumbs down, especially so early in the term. For some context: None of President Barack Obama’s judicial nominees was rated as “not qualified” while he was in office.One reason this keeps happening is that Trump isn’t submitting his nominees to the ABA in advance of announcing their nominations. That’s a break from many of his predecessors, who have waited for the ABA to weigh in on the qualifications of their court picks before making the nominations official.Trump is also racing through his nominations of lifetime judges and not vetting nominees as thoroughly as, say, Obama did. That’s increased the likelihood of problems with his court picks later in the confirmation process.A White House spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment.Aides to Sens. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) and Luther Strange (R-Ala.), who recommended Talley to the White House, did not respond to a request for comment.Last week, Leonard Steven Grasz, another one of Trump’s court picks unanimously rated “not qualified” to be a federal judge, sat through his Senate confirmation hearing. It was humiliating.Grasz is a nominee for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit. The last time a circuit court nominee was unanimously rated “not qualified” was in 2006. "

Growing up in New Jersey, the Sikh American politician told HuffPost he regularly faced bullying and harassment at public school because of his religion and the turban he wears as a sign of devotion to his faith.Years later, Bhalla is celebrating a remarkable milestone: He’s been elected as his home state’s first Sikh American mayor.Bhalla won Hoboken’s mayoral race on Tuesday, edging out a pool of five other candidates. The city councilman claimed victory despite being targeted by a racist flyer campaign during the race which falsely linked him to terrorism. Asked what he would tell his younger self, Bhalla told HuffPost: “I would say that there is no conflict in this country between being a Sikh and being a successful American.”“I think it’s important for Sikh children to realize that they should have pride in their faith and know that in this country, the sky is the limit,” Bhalla said. “I hope as mayor, I can present a positive image of Sikh to the general public and I hope that it will make it easier for young kids in school.”Narinder Singh, interim executive director of the advocacy group, The Sikh Coalition, called Bhalla’s election a “watershed moment” for the Sikh American community. “In addition to inspiring the next generation of Sikh leaders to recognize that public office is possible, his election reminds all Americans that diversity remains our nation’s greatest strengths,” Singh told HuffPost. Bhalla, a Democrat and a 17-year resident of Hoboken, previously served two terms as an at-large member of the Hoboken City Council. Last week, the race for the mayoral post took a dark turn when Bhalla became the target of a racist flyer campaign. The flyers, which were reportedly placed on car windshields in Hoboken, urged residents not to “let TERRORISM take over our Town!”Language on the flyers claimed they were funded by the campaign of Michael DeFusco, a rival candidate. DeFusco denied having anything to do with the flyers and condemned them as “racist garbage.”“It was very disturbing and hurtful,” Bhalla told HuffPost about the flyer campaign ― not just for him, but also for his wife and children.He said that this wasn’t the first time he’s been called a terrorist, saying that he has received abuse on social media in the past, and experienced bullying during his childhood in New Jersey. “At this point in my political career, I have a thick skin,” he said. “This is not something that is new to me.”Sikhs have been part of America’s religious fabric for more than 100 years. But some Americans are still unfamiliar with the religion, or mistakenly believe that the turbans Sikhs wear as an article of their faith mean that they are Muslim. Since the September 11 attacks, Sikhs have often become victims of racial profiling, bullying, and hate crimes.Bhalla said that he believed racism and xenophobia towards Sikhs, but also towards other vulnerable minority communities, has been exacerbated by President Donald Trump’s election. “Unfortunately, we live in a slightly different climate, where some people think this type of conduct is acceptable,” he said. “It’s important for those of us in government to make sure we send a strong, clear message that hate is not acceptable in our communities.” Bhalla also said that he feels humbled to have won the mayoral race and by the support that he’s received from the Sikh American community at large.“It means the world to me. The idea that I can uplift people, whether they are young people or older people in the Sikh community, and instill a sense of pride,” he said. “This is in a way a victory for the Sikh community as a whole in that it creates an opportunity to present a positive image for Sikhs in Hoboken and the rest of the country.”Gujari Singh, communications manager for the Sikh American Legal Defense and Education Fund, said that Bhalla’s win signaled the “start of a new era” for Sikh Americans in the country.“These victories lay the foundation for our youth and future generations to pursue public office and engage more heavily in the American political system,” Singh said. “This milestone also conveys that Sikh Americans are an integral part of the American fabric, sharing the same aspirations and dreams as all other Americans.”Bhalla is one of several Sikh American mayors in the country’s history. Sikhs have reportedly been elected as mayors in Charlottesville, Virginia, Laurel Hollow, New York, San Joaquin City, California, and other cities. And Bhalla isn’t the only Sikh American politician to emerge victorious during this year’s elections. A Sikh American woman, Satwinder Kaur, was elected to a City Council position in Washington state.  Another South Asian American of Sikh heritage, Manka Dhingra, is presumed to have been elected to Washington’s state Senate.Shawn Singh Ghuman, communications director for the National Sikh Campaign, told HuffPost that he felt Bhalla’s election shows that Sikhs can and will overcome the religious discrimination they have faced in this country.“One aim of our organization was to ensure Sikhs in America, now and future generations, can play a larger role in our civic society,” he told HuffPost in an email. “With the success of several Sikh’s in yesterday’s election, we are well on our way to achieving that goal and we hope this election encourages more Sikh Americans to get involved in public service and run for office. ”"
50,POLITICS,Trump Finds Key Ally For Confirming His Homeland Security Secretary: The Swamp,Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kirstjen-nielsen-trump-homeland-security-lobbyist_us_5a01f634e4b06ff32c93d14a,A lobbyist with major security-related clients is helping the White House push Kirstjen Nielsen. Come on!,2017-11-08,"President Donald Trump stands beside Kirstjen Nielsen, his nominee for homeland security secretary.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a01f831170000210079650d.jpeg?ops=crop_246_270_3754_2428%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Remember how presidential candidate Donald Trump repeatedly vowed to “drain the swamp” in Washington? His push to confirm the next homeland security secretary proves he’s forgotten all about that.The White House has been working with a top D.C. lobbyist to help confirm nominee Kirstjen Nielsen ― an unusually cozy arrangement that could give the lobbyist’s firm a major advantage in helping clients land future government contracts.HuffPost obtained copies of emails that show Stewart Verdery of Monument Policy Group, which touts its homeland security expertise to clients, coordinating dozens of former top officials with the Department of Homeland Security to sign onto a letter praising Nielsen. The letter was sent to the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs ahead of her Wednesday confirmation hearing.Verdery, a former counsel to Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and a former DHS official who worked with Nielsen, drafted the missive.“Looks like we will be sending this letter either tomorrow or Tuesday so I wanted to make sure people saw all of the names on the letter before it goes,” Verdery wrote in a Oct. 22 email to the group of signers. “There are 34 names here, including 4 former Deputy Secretaries. Thanks again for your help!”Here’s a batch of those emails, minus people’s email addresses.There’s nothing illegal or particularly uncommon about a private sector lobbyist playing a role in helping to advance a nominee. What’s notable here is how deeply involved Verdery appears to have been in a process typically managed by the White House and the nominee.A former senior DHS official, who requested anonymity in order to speak freely, said the task of reaching out to peers to sign onto a letter of support usually goes to the nominee, not to a lobbyist who stands to benefit from the nominee’s confirmation.“There’s a whole White House legislative affairs team with a Senate lead. There’s a whole DHS legislative affairs team,” said this former official. “They should be running this.”Scott Amey, general counsel at the Project On Government Oversight, said the emails show that Trump is doing precisely what he campaigned against: letting Washington insiders and other people owed favors steer the federal government.“Essentially you have a lobbyist lobbying the Senate in the name of former senior DHS officials on behalf of the DHS nominee. I don’t think anything spells swampy as much as that situation,” said Amey. “I just wonder how many of those former officials, and how soon Verdery, will be booking meetings to see Nielsen if she is confirmed.”DHS, which oversees matters from border security to immigration to disaster response, hands out a tremendous amount of money in federal contracts. Between 2011 and 2014, the top five DHS contractors received $8.9 billion, according to MapLight, a nonpartisan nonprofit that examines the influence of money in politics.Verdery’s work in boosting the person who may very well be the next homeland security secretary could give Monument Policy Group’s clients, present or future, better access and sympathetic ears at the department. The firm’s current clients include DHS contractors Boeing and Northrop Grumman, and businesses like Toronto Pearson International Airport that regularly interact with DHS agencies.Verdery told HuffPost he doesn’t remember if the White House or DHS asked him to take the lead on the letter to the Senate committee, or if he volunteered to do it. He said he’s known Nielsen for years and considers her a friend, so when it came to coordinating signatures on a White House-sanctioned letter to help her, he was “happy to do it.”Asked if he sees any conflicts of interest in working with the White House to push Nielsen’s confirmation, Verdery said, “I couldn’t comment on that.”Tyler Houlton, a spokesman for DHS, suggested there’s nothing inappropriate about Verdery’s role given that he and Nielsen were colleagues at the department during President George W. Bush’s administration.“It is common in every administration for former colleagues to enlist those who have worked with and respect the nominee in drafting a letter of support for Congress,” Houlton said. “The strong bipartisan support of highly respected and established experts in the nominee’s field, like Ms. Nielsen has received, is widely considered a positive.”A White House spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.Verdery has already touted his access to the White House: A few weeks ago, he tweeted pictures from a White House party for Nielsen that he was invited to. Last week, he also boasted on Twitter that he was named one of the top “hired guns” among D.C. lobbyists by The Hill.Brendan Fischer, an ethics attorney at the Campaign Legal Center, thought HuffPost wanted to talk about a different influence peddler helping to confirm Nielsen when we called for comment about Verdery. He noted that Thad Bingel, a consultant with Command Group who likewise has DHS contractors as clients, has been raising eyebrows for his role in assigning government staffers to prepare policy memos and coordinate Nielsen’s paperwork for the Senate.What is clear, Fischer said, is a pattern of private firms going to bat for Nielsen, which raises the likelihood that they will expect something in return if she gets confirmed.“It certainly appears this nomination is going to make a lot of lobbyists very happy,” he said. “It doesn’t look good.”"
51,POLITICS,"Emails Show Richard Spencer Bounced A $10,565 Check For Florida Event",Jessica Schulberg and Travis Waldron,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/richard-spencer-university-florida-bounced-check_us_5a0380b9e4b0f76b05c33438,"Spencer wants a white ethno-state, but he can barely pull off a campus speech.",2017-11-08,Richard Spencer at the University of Florida in Gainesville. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a03830f1c00003b00b33f4d.jpeg?cache=JrkCpX8Bb7&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Richard Spencer and his band of white nationalist brothers see themselves as part of a superior race destined to create a utopian white ethno-state. But first, their checks have to clear.Spencer has spent the last several months bullying universities into letting him preach his racist vision to college students. Most recently, he spoke at the University of Florida in Gainesville. The event, which the university tried to counter by courting an appearance from legendary former quarterback Tim Tebow, eventually took place, with Spencer parading onto campus to his own personalized Depeche Mode-heavy playlist. But in the leadup to his speech, Spencer and his colleagues at the National Policy Institute — Spencer’s white nationalist think tank — struggled to complete basic chores required to stage the event, according to hundreds of pages of university emails obtained by HuffPost. They bungled money, forgot appointments, and appear to have failed to read all of their rental contract. In order to secure a room for the Oct. 19 speech, Spencer was required send a signed rental agreement and a check for $10,564.80 by Oct. 6. NPI executive director Evan McLaren put the contract and the check in the mail that morning, using FedEx’s same-day delivery service, requiring a university employee to accept the delivery around 10:30 that evening. Days later, the check bounced. NPI eventually wired the money to the university, allowing Spencer’s speech to proceed, Nancy Chrystal-Green, the university’s senior director of student engagement, told HuffPost.Bounced checks are not uncommon, of course, but Spencer’s supposedly racially superior team made other slip-ups too. On Oct. 3, for instance, Chrystal-Green emailed Cameron Padgett, a graduate student who books Spencer’s university speaking events, notifying him that McLaren had failed to initial each page of the contract. That was McLaren’s mistake. But Padgett forgot about scheduled phone calls and asked Chrystal-Green for answers to questions he could have figured out by reading documents she’d already provided. “Should we pay the low estimate range or the high?” Padgett asked in one email, referring to the range of cost estimates for the event. “Contract asks for high,” Chrystal-Green reminded him. “We settle the costs afterwards and give you a refund if warranted.”Days later, Padgett asked to set up a time that week to speak over the phone. “I thought we were on for 11:30,” Chrystal-Green wrote back.There were also mix-ups around which media outlets NPI credentialed to cover Spencer’s speech. When a reporter from Japan’s Kyodo News was turned away, the reporter appealed to Spencer’s admiration for Japan and its ethnically homogeneous population. “It is our understanding that Mr. Spencer traveled to Japan which he said he was fond of. We would like t [sic] ask Mr. Spencer why he like [sic] Japan’s immigration policy?” Matthew Carland from Kyodo News wrote McLaren. Asked if Spencer and his team were particularly difficult to coordinate with, Chrystal-Green was diplomatic. “As with any program there are always some hiccups in the event planning,” she told HuffPost.Residents of Gainesville, where the University of Florida is located, were broadly opposed to Spencer’s visit. They spoke out against his racist ideology and feared his presence would lead to violent confrontations between white nationalists and protesters. The day of the speech, Gainesville Mayor Lauren Poe (D) told HuffPost that Spencer was a “terrorist leader” whose followers “descend upon communities, harm people and then leave.” Faced with legal threats, the University of Florida ultimately decided to allow Spencer to speak. Still, the university and its students took steps to counter his message. Students and campus organizations reached out to Chrystal-Green to plan events opposite Spencer’s speech that celebrated the campus’s diversity and unity, the emails showed. Chrystal-Green herself tried to enlist the help of Tebow, the former University of Florida quarterback who won a Heisman Trophy and led the Gators to two national championships.Tebow was in Gainesville days before Spencer’s speech for “SEC Nation,” the ESPN college football show on which he serves as an analyst. Chrystal-Green reached out to assistant athletic director Jon Rubin with “a favor to ask.” “I’m sure you have seen the news about a white nationalist coming to speak at UF on Oct. 19,” Chrystal-Green wrote in an Oct. 6 email. “One of the things we are doing is showing a virtual assembly during the speech. We are getting in contact with famous alums asking to record a brief message of unity, togetherness, Gator Nation, etc. Obviously a message from Tim Tebow would be a great addition. Is there an easy method by which to ask him?” Rubin told Chrystal-Green to reach out to ESPN public relations officials about Tebow’s availability. An ESPN spokeswoman told HuffPost, “The university reached out to us to gauge Tim’s involvement in recording a video with regards to the Richard Spencer event at UF and we declined on his behalf.” A group of student leaders ultimately planned an event that featured speeches from students who shared their own “experiences focusing on unity,” as well as pre-recorded messages from University of Florida president W. Kent Fuchs, who had originally denied Spencer a venue; actor Kal Penn, who did not attend the school but was on campus for a separate event; and Thaddeus Bullard, a former Florida football player who is now a professional wrestler known as Titus O’Neil. One task Spencer wouldn’t leave to his underlings at NPI was the event’s music selection. Two days before he was scheduled to speak, Spencer emailed Chrystal-Green a link to a 13-track Spotify playlist — which included five Depeche Mode songs — dubbed the “College Tour Playlist.”Spencer has called Depeche Mode “the official band of the alt-right,” a title the band has actively disavowed. “Depeche Mode has no ties to Richard Spencer or the alt-right and does not support the alt-right,” lead singer Dave Gahan told Billboard earlier this year. “He’s a c**t.” Spencer asked the university to play his playlist on shuffle as people entered the auditorium for his speech. “Please play ‘Where’s the Revolution’ as I’m introduced and come on stage,” Spencer wrote to Chrystal-Green, apparently entirely misinterpreting the meaning of the Depeche Mode song. Chrystal-Green said the university complied with Spencer’s music requests, as it does with all renters. But the music was drowned out by a different sort of chorus. As the white nationalist darling took the stage, University of Florida students chanted, “Fuck you, Spencer.”  Spencer did not respond to a request for comment."

And less than a year later, on Nov. 7, Carman would lose his seat to a woman who decided to run after protesting Carman’s comments. Ashley Bennett, 32, showed up with dozens of other women constituents at a public meeting Carman held on Jan. 24, just days after he posted the sexist meme. Inspired by the Women’s March and what she saw as Carman’s “mocking and belittling people who are expressing their concerns about their community and the nation,” Bennett decided to run against him. Though the seat is in a Republican district, Bennett bested Carman by 1,000 votes, out of 14,000 votes cast. Last month, Bennett told the AP that protests like the Women’s March “woke a lot of people up.”Bennett wasn’t the only woman who won on Tuesday night after getting angry post-presidential election.Kelly Fowler, a Virgina Beach, Va. resident, attended the Women’s March with her daughter Tessa Anne in January.“I thought the march was gonna be for her,” Fowler said in a campaign ad. “I realized that it was for both of us and I didn’t feel alone anymore. So I knew I needed to do something. I need to be part of the legislative process.”On Tuesday night, Fowler won a seat in the Virginia House of Delegates. She unseated incumbent Ron Villanueva ― who had voted to make the anniversary of Roe v. Wade the “Day of Tears” in the state. ― and flipped the 21st district from Republican to Democrat. Hala Ayala, who helped organize buses from her Virginia community to the Women’s March on Washington, also won a seat in Virginia’s House of Delegates, becoming one of the first Latina women to serve in the House. “Once I heard that the Women’s March was happening, I knew I wanted to be involved and to walk shoulder-to-shoulder with men and women,” Ayala told Elle in August. “We were just able to come together and kind of recalibrate ourselves, do what we needed to do to organize our thoughts and our energies and figure out the next steps. But we have to continue to take action. We have to make change. We can’t let that be the end of the road.”On Tuesday night, Ayala unseated Rich Anderson, a 4-term Republican incumbent.Organizations like She Should Run and Emily’s List have seen record numbers of women stepping up since November 2016. Many on Twitter noted the snowball effect that the presidential election and the Women’s March have had in driving women to run for office ― and win. Sometimes, karma’s a bitch ― and she looks like a motivated, pissed off woman.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated John Carman’s title.

But Republicans say you can’t trust any of those. Over 47 percent of the tax changes in the legislation would benefit the richest 1 percent of households over 10 years, a report released Wednesday by the Tax Policy Center said. Wednesday’s report closely resembles an analysis TPC issued on Monday, which the group quickly retracted because of an error ― which Republicans have said is all the more reason not to believe them. Two controversies dominate the debate over how to analyze a tax bill: debt and distribution. Tax changes affect the amount of revenue the government collects, and Republicans disagree with most experts, who say their tax reform legislation would reduce revenue by more than $1 trillion over 10 years. GOP lawmakers would rather just take it on faith that tax cuts create growth and pay for themselves. The other controversy Republicans take issue with is the question of whose taxes would go down and whose would go up. Republicans say their bill would reduce taxes for everybody, but TPC says 7 percent of households would face higher rates next year and 25 percent would pay more in 10 years. Rather than debate the merits of their tax proposal based on these facts, Republicans want to debate the facts themselves.Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas), chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, blasted the “liberal Tax Policy Center” in a radio interview Tuesday morning, noting that the group withdrew its analysis after a mistake. Later that day, in an interview with HuffPost, he didn’t let up.“You know, they’re the gang that can’t compute straight,” Brady said. “They had a tax analysis before there was a bill. Now they have one they had to abandon within hours. I don’t know how many strikes you get before you’re out.”When HuffPost asked whether it said anything about the organization that it was upfront about its mistake ― that TPC withdrew its analysis entirely when it discovered an error ― Brady pointed to what he called the earlier “imaginary analysis” TPC did when Republicans released their tax framework in September.“They didn’t even admit that there was no tax bill to score,” Brady said. “So, look, there’s a lot of credibility that’s gone there.” (In fact, TPC was very transparent about how it analyzed the tax framework Republicans put forward. The center used similar Republican proposals from the past year to fill in gaps in the plan.)In its Monday report, the center underestimated the amount that some households would benefit from an expanded child tax credit in the Republican bill. The updated report reduces the number of households that would face a tax increase a decade from now by about 3 percentage points. Also in the new report, the total tax benefit accruing to the richest 1 percent of households has declined from 48.4 percent to 47.2 percent.Brady isn’t the only Republican criticizing TPC. President Donald Trump’s top economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, said in October that it was “scientifically indefensible” for TPC to downplay the positive economic feedback that tax cuts could create, despite a consensus among most economists that tax cuts don’t spur the kind of growth Republicans are hoping for. In response, Larry Summers, a former Treasury secretary under Bill Clinton and a top economic adviser to President Barack Obama, said he no longer took Hassett seriously after his “absurd attacks on the Tax Policy Center.”While Republicans like Brady criticize TPC for putting forth a score of the GOP bill when there wasn’t yet a bill, Republicans themselves were making wild claims about economic growth way before there was legislation.Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said the GOP tax proposal would generate so much growth and extra tax revenue that it would reduce the national debt by $1 trillion ― an estimate seemingly based more on gut than math. A number of Republicans in Congress have also told HuffPost for weeks that their tax cuts would pay for themselves ― although, again, there’s no evidence that tax cuts replace lost revenue with economic growth.The TPC isn’t out on a limb with its estimate of large budget deficits resulting from the proposal. The conservative Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, Fitch Ratings, and Congress’ own Joint Committee on Taxation and Congressional Budget Office agree. Even the GOP-friendly Tax Foundation ― even when using the GOP’s preferred “dynamic scoring,” which accounts for macroeconomic effects in the cost of legislation ― said the Republican tax proposal would increase the national debt by nearly $1 trillion over the next decade.But Republicans refuse to believe it. When HuffPost asked Rep. Lynn Jenkins (R-Kan.) about the tax proposal and her vote against the budget setting up tax reform, Jenkins explained that she voted no on the budget because “it didn’t balance.” (The budget allows Republicans to increase debt by $1.5 trillion in the name of tax cuts.)But Jenkins told HuffPost she supports the tax proposal now because revenue won’t decrease in a dynamic score. When we noted that the Tax Foundation’s dynamic score said debt would still increase by $1 trillion, Jenkins said, “You’ll have to wait until the accurate one is out.”When the Tax Foundation found in a separate study that temporary expensing of assets ― which allows businesses to write off the cost of new investments ― would have a limited effect on economic growth, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) refused to believe that was a Tax Foundation finding.“I haven’t read that study, but I’d be kind of shocked if the Tax Foundation said that,” Ryan said. He suggested that a reporter had confused the Tax Foundation with TPC.“I think TPC has shown their ideological and partisan colors with the fact that they put out an estimate on a mythical tax plan that hasn’t been written,” Ryan said in early October.A few weeks later, Bloomberg reporter Jonathan Nicholson, who wrote his own story on Republicans attacking TPC, asked Ryan about his office describing the Tax Foundation as “nonpartisan” when the board is stacked with Republicans. Ryan cited disagreements with TPC’s economic modeling, but he also praised the Tax Foundation for having a number of Republicans on staff.The Tax Policy Center also has plenty of prominent Republicans in its ranks. Two of TPC’s fellows are former Congressional Budget Office directors who served under Republican presidents ― Donald Marron (under George W. Bush) and Rudy Penner (under Ronald Reagan). And N. Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard economics professor who is on the TPC board, served as the chairman of George W. Bush’s Council of Economic Advisers. The Tax Policy Center may get its left-leaning reputation because it’s a joint venture of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute, two respected think tanks that are also (perhaps unfairly) seen as left-leaning. But neither think tank is a bastion of ideology, and both are known for their policy-minded analysis ― as well as for having well-known Republicans serving in major positions.As Ryan said, part of the problem may just be that TPC uses a distributional analysis, which divvies up the percentage benefit of tax changes among income groups. The percentages seem politically unfavorable to Republicans because the wealthiest Americans currently pay the most taxes by far, so when a piece of legislation lowers taxes across the board, the rich benefit the most.But Democrats think this goes to a more fundamental problem with the Republican Party ― one that isn’t based on some intellectual argument over economic models.“A very nasty, bad habit of Donald Trump has now infected the Republicans, which is, anyone who disagrees with you, attack ad hominem,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told HuffPost on Tuesday when asked about Republicans deriding TPC. “It’s not what America is about, it’s not what the Founding Fathers wanted us to do. It’s become an overwhelming tendency in their party.”Like TPC, the Joint Committee on Taxation has found that not everybody would benefit from Republicans’ proposed changes to the tax code. The committee has reported that, under the legislation, nearly 20 percent of households would face higher taxes a decade from now.But Republicans say nearly everyone will benefit from their plan ― you just need to trust them. That’s what Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.), a former economist, told HuffPost, even though he wasn’t sure what he was supposed to think of TPC.“I get them all confused,” Brat said, in an extremely relatable moment. “Too many acronyms.”Amanda Terkel contributed reporting.This article has been updated to include Schumer’s comments."

The women behind the project also worked with two librarians, Christina Bell and Deborah Tomaras, to launch the collection online. Since 2014, the team has searched for books that help more kids see themselves reflected in the pages, whether that means with characters of color or settings of the stories. Each book is divided into helpful categories for users, but parents can also use the site’s “quick lists” to find books that are, as Aronson put it, especially “strong” when it comes to topics like activism, adoption and mindfulness. They can also use the search tool to find diverse books that might mention something their kids love like food, dance or dragons.The database includes books published in the U.S. since 2002 that include illustrations to help tell the story and mostly include human characters (there are some exceptions for animals). The collection lives on the first floor of a library on Bates College’s campus and is available for checkout or interlibrary loan. “A big thing that we emphasize is access,” Aronson explained.When asked if anything surprised her about her research into the collection, which will be developed annually, Aronson said she underestimated how much time it would take to simply find books to include.“These books are hard to find,” she said. “There are many that have never seen the light of day for various reasons.”Aronson, whose experience as a biracial woman has impacted the project and her motivation behind it, told HuffPost that the collection sheds light on stereotypes that exist in the literary world about certain communities. “One of the things that we started to uncover when were thinking about the categories is who’s populating these categories,” she told HuffPost. “Not how many books are there about African-American children, but how are they being represented.”The psychology professor said that in her findings, the majority of diverse picture books feature African-American characters rather than Latino or Asian characters, and many of these books in the collection are biographies and/or highlight civil rights. Most are also put into the site’s “oppressed” category.“That’s an important part of history, and kids should learn about this, but an overemphasis has potential to teach children that being black is about oppression and ... that it’s a thing of the past,” Aronson said. Aronson also stressed that the database is not meant to be “prescriptive.”“We’re not trying to tell people what to do,” she said. “We’re sharing our data to provide a moment for reflection. That’s one of the ways that we hope the site can be used.”For more information, head to the Diverse BookFinder site."

A 45 percent plurality of Americans think that Trump is unlikely to live up to most of his campaign promises, with 38 percent saying that he has already or is still likely to do so ― numbers that have budged little since an April survey taken as he neared his 100th day in office. Among those who consider him unlikely to fulfill his pledges, three-quarters say he should face most of the blame for that failure, with just 9 percent putting more of the blame on Congress.A majority now say they don’t expect him to succeed in “draining the swamp” in Washington or in building a border wall and making Mexico pay for it; a near-majority, 48 percent, doubt he’ll “make America great again.” By a 6-percentage-point margin, however, 45 to 39 percent, they believe he has or will bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. ― the promise the nation most wants to see the president fulfill.(Not all of them will consider that a bad thing. A fifth of Americans, including more than 40 percent of Hillary Clinton voters, say that they don’t want to see Trump keep any of the below promises.)The vast majority of voters who supported Trump say either that he already has lived up to most of his campaign promises (29 percent) or remains likely to do so (56 percent). Most expect him to accomplish each of the 10 promises asked about in the survey, although their level of bullishness varies: 55 percent think he will “drain the swamp” or has done so already, while nearly three-quarters believe he’ll repeal the Affordable Care Act, and almost 90 percent expect him to bring back jobs.And to an even greater degree than they did previously, Trump voters see his behavior as president as matching his rhetoric in the campaign trail. Slightly above three-quarters say that Trump’s positions as president are not very or not at all different from what they were when he was running for office, up from 63 percent in the April survey. By contrast, 83 percent of Clinton voters think Trump is unlikely to live up to his campaign promises.Few voters on either side are rueing the decisions they made last year. Just 1 percent of Clinton voters and 2 percent of Trump voters say they regret their vote in 2016. Some Americans who didn’t make it to the polls last November, however, now wish they’d done so: 18 percent of non-voters say they think they should have voted, although 49 percent say they don’t mind not having participated.

It also deals a blow to the Trump-like right-wing populist playbook that Gillespie employed in his bid to win.“Democrats were anxious all along, at the very end, about whether this thing would go their way, whether their core vote would turn out for them. And it did,” said Quentin Kidd, a political science professor at Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Virginia. “They’re breathing a sigh of relief.”What’s more, the significant size of Northam’s win bodes well for Democrats across the country in the 2018 midterm elections, according to Kidd.“Everything we thought was happening was actually happening,” he said. “There was a lot of pent up anger and frustration in the Democratic electorate.”Northam had held a modest advantage in an average of major polls on Election Day. But the wide variation in individual polls toward the end of the contest spooked many Democrats who had anticipated a more certain victory.Northam, 58, a pediatric neurologist and the current lieutenant governor, ran a mainstream Democratic campaign that emphasized his all-American biography. Northam is a graduate of the Virginia Military Institute who served as an Army doctor during Operation Desert Storm before establishing a practice in southeast Virginia’s Hampton Roads region.Northam campaigned on continuing the work of Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), who has presided over sustained economic growth and restored the voting rights of 168,000 former felons.Northam also proposed increasing public school funding, providing tuition-free community college education in key areas of study for students who pledge a year of service, and using Affordable Care Act funds to expand Medicaid.Northam will have the important opportunity to play a role the next time the state legislature redraws congressional and state districts in 2021. As governor, he will have the power to veto a plan submitted by the Republican legislature if he believes the makeup of the new districts is unduly partisan.More than any one policy outcome, however, Northam’s win delights progressives for what it denies the GOP: another vindication of Trump-like race baiting. Gillespie, 56, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee and a Beltway lobbyist, once embodied the socially moderate, fiscally conservative establishment wing of the Republican Party. And to some extent, Gillespie maintained this profile, emphasizing economic policy on the stump, including a proposal to cut Virginia’s income tax rates by 10 percent across the board.But in a bid to shore up a wayward right-wing base that nearly handed populist Corey Stewart the nomination in a tough GOP primary, Gillespie embraced the Trump playbook. In a barrage of negative advertisements, Gillespie sought to paint Northam as a frightening radical who would enable convicted sex offenders, undocumented immigrants and members of the El Salvadoran gang MS-13 to run amok in the Old Dominion State. He also claimed that Northam wanted to take down the state’s Confederate monuments, despite Northam’s assurances that he would allow localities to decide.Ultimately, Gillespie’s approach scared off too many of the voters he needed to win in the increasingly Democratic-leaning state.“Gillespie tried to do two things: He tried to run on white identity politics and Republican economics,” Kidd said. “Republicans have to decide which of those two they’re going to run on because they probably can’t do both at same time.”"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0293291d00003b007f4adf.jpeg?cache=jd0LNsjhTo&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump took a far more measured tone during his address to South Korea’s National Assembly on Wednesday, touting the option of diplomacy with North Korea while delivering a strong message to the country’s leader that it must end its nuclear weapons program.Trump, speaking in Seoul as part of his 12-day tour of Asia, delivered a direct and at times heavy-handed message to Kim Jong Un, telling the North Korean leader: “Do not underestimate us. Do not try us.”However the president echoed calls from a day earlier when, speaking at a news conference with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, he urged Pyongyang to “come to the table and make a deal.”“I also come here to deliver a message directly to the leader: The weapons you are acquiring are not making you safer. They are putting your regime in grave danger,” Trump told the National Assembly. “Every step you take down this dark path increases the peril you face. North Korea is not the paradise your grandfather envisioned. It is a hell that no person deserves.“We will offer a path to a much better future. It begins with an end to the aggression of your regime, a stop to your development of ballistic missiles and complete verifiable and total denuclearization.”North Korea has so far refused offers of diplomacy and said it would not put its nuclear weapons ― or its ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States ― on the bargaining table.The speech stands in contrast to Trump’s past remarks, in which the president has threatened or demeaned Kim on Twitter. In September, he vowed to “totally destroy North Korea” during his first address to the United Nations and called Kim a “rocket man ... on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime.”Other Trump administration officials, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, have said diplomacy would remain on the table “until the first bomb drops.”Trump’s speech Wednesday, which included a sweeping history of the conflict on the Korean peninsula, included some overt hits at the North, including his assertion that the region “is a country ruled by a cult.” He pointed to human rights abuses by Pyongyang against its own people and acts of aggression including the recent death of American student Otto Warmbier, who Trump said was “tortured” to death.“We will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction, we will not be intimidated and we will not let the worst atrocities in history be repeated here, on this ground we fought and died so hard to secure,” Trump said. “To those nations that choose to ignore this threat ― or, worse still, to enable it ― the weight of this crisis is on your conscience.”A surprise visit by Trump and Moon to the Korean Demilitarized Zone, the heavily-armed buffer region between North and South Korea, was canceled at the last minute on Wednesday due to poor weather. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the planned visit, even though it did not take place, was of a “historic nature” and showed “the strength of the alliance” between the U.S. and South Korea.Trump’s next stop will be China, where he will meet with President Xi Jinping."

It’s caused by greenhouse-gas pollution released by human industrial activity. Its consequences can already be felt across every region and coastline of the United States — and, unless we stop emitting greenhouse gases soon, those consequences will almost certainly get worse. Those are the headline findings of the Climate Science Special Report, a sweeping and more than 800-page examination of the evidence. The report was published Friday by four agencies of the U.S. government and academics from across the country.Their conclusions form the first volume of the new National Climate Assessment, a report on the science and impacts of global warming that Congress requires agencies to complete every four years. A draft version of the second volume, on the human impacts of climate change, was also released Friday.RELATED: The Zombie Diseases of Climate Change“This is the most comprehensive assessment of climate science currently available in the world, and it reaffirms what we’ve already known,” said Robert Kopp, one of the lead authors of the report and a professor of climate science at Rutgers University. “If we want to do something like stay under 2 degrees Celsius of warming, the window to do that is closing in the next couple decades.”The two-degree limit is a rough target used by the United Nations to signal the point where dangerous climate change could begin. The report finds that the world can only continue to emit carbon for roughly another 23 years at current levels before it will have a more than two-thirds chance of going over the limit.The Climate Science Special Report comes at an auspicious time in the history of global warming and the United States. The report’s conclusions do not deviate wildly from the last 20 years of consensus in climate science. They do not shock anyone who follows the field. And they don’t break new ground: The authors have synthesized the best available papers; they have not conducted new research for this report. RELATED: Climate Change Will Bring Major Flooding to New York Every 5 YearsBut simply by affirming the science of climate change, the authors — and the interagency bureaucrats who shepherded the writing of the document — provide a contrast to the actions and statements of political figures in the Trump administration. Scott Pruitt, the director of the Environmental Protection Agency, has cast doubt on the idea, fundamental to climate science, that the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere significantly controls Earth’s climate.President Trump and Pruitt have dismantled the aggressive policies advanced by President Barack Obama meant to reduce U.S. carbon pollution. In October, Pruitt repealed the Clean Power Plan, which would have reduced greenhouse-gas emissions from the power sector. In June, Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement — and, with it, pulled back from Obama’s decision to apply the full force of the U.S. foreign-policy apparatus to reducing carbon pollution worldwide.The assessment is a scientific achievement by itself. The last major synthesis of climate science, as a field, was published in 2013 by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Much has changed over those four years, including significant updates to how the field understands the interaction between global warming and hurricane strength.RELATED: The American South Will Bear the Worst of Climate Change’s CostsIt is also the end result of a colossal amount of work. The National Academy of Sciences and the U.S. Global-Change Research Program both convened expert panels to comb through the report line by line and subject it to meticulous comment and approval. During the writing process, scientists from four federal agencies — including NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency — contributed significant writing and expertise. They were joined by researchers from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and 11 academic institutions, including Columbia University, Texas Tech University, and the Naval Postgraduate School. It is not an overstatement to say that a vast swath of the profession of American climate science played a hand in this report.Its conclusions span the Earth system. Modern climate change is primarily caused by the release of carbon dioxide and other gases into the atmosphere, which prevent the sun’s heat from escaping back into space. Over the past several decades, this heat has accumulated in the atmosphere and oceans. Now, the United States sets many more extreme heat records than extreme cold records; it sees more intense heat waves and weaker, briefer cold snaps.That heat is shrinking the ice sheets at the planet’s north and south poles and causing the oceans to expand. The report includes forecasts of how much the sea level will rise around the world. The sea level worldwide has risen by about seven or eight inches since 1900, with three of those inches coming in the last 25 years. This will intensify: The world ocean is almost certain to rise one to four feet by the end of this century. And if some of the fastest scenarios for the melting of the Antarctic come to pass, then the sea could rise as much as eight feet.The report sketches out what that sea-level rise will do to different regions of the United States. The East Coast will likely experience even more of that sea-level rise than the world average. The West Coast will likely experience less — unless Antarctica begins to melt in its entirety, in which case it will also see above-average rise.It also dives into “potential surprises” that the United States may encounter in a climate-changed world. In that chapter, which previous National Climate Assessments did not include, the authors warn of “compound extremes,” the risk of multiple unusual weather conditions coming to pass at the same time. For instance, scorching heat and a lack of rain during the same summer will intensify a drought (and increase the chance of wildfires) far more than either one would alone. If excess rain falls on waterlogged ground, then the chance of a devastating flood also rises. It’s hard for scientists to predict how the various extremes of climate change will overlap with each other.The authors caution that current climate models are more likely to underestimate future warming than overestimate it. While climate models have accurately predicted the past few decades of warming, they struggle to describe warmer climates that occurred millions of years ago. Models suggest that these climates should be colder than archaeological and climatic evidence tells us that they were, which means that they may fail to capture how warm Earth can get. There may be tipping points in the climate system — difficult-to-predict points of no return— that researchers may not fully understand.Environmentalists and some government scientists had worried that the Trump administration would try to suppress the release of the report. But some of the authors, speaking anonymously so as not to distract from the release, said they saw little evidence of political interference during the writing process.Some references to the Paris Agreement were removed from the final report, as compared to a draft version leaked over the summer, sources indicated. Environmental groups plan to conduct a line-by-line comparison of the final report with the leaked drafts in the coming days.This story originally appeared on TheAtlantic.com.More from The Atlantic: A Catfishing With a Happy Ending, Death at a Penn State Fraternity"

To some, He is just a mystical king or a prophet, but to me, He is my everything. A lot of folks in the media and politics like to wear their religion on their sleeves; I’m not one of those people. My relationship with my Savior is sacred, private, and until now, had not been open to much public discourse.Some tend to dismiss my Christianity because of my sexuality, but honestly, they don’t have a say. My relationship with Jesus Christ is between Him and me, and it’s not up for public debate. I truly believe that God gave me my sexuality, and I am perfectly and wonderfully made.As I became older and more mature, I realized that my attraction to the same-sex was more than just a phase or demon that could be prayed away. That moment made my relationship with the church and God more nuanced. I would find myself waking up in the middle of the night and begging God to take urges away. I would delete text messages and internet histories so no one would know my secret. And I would spend my spare time daydreaming about an alternative reality, where I was a straight man free from shame, fear, or hiding.It wasn’t until I became an adult that I understood that my complicated relationship was with the Church, not Jesus Christ. I John 4:7-8 states, “ dear friends, let’s love each other, because love is from God, and everyone who loves is born from God and knows God. The person who doesn’t love does not know God, because God is love.” And it was that scripture that spoke to my dilemma. You see, I knew at age ten that I loved Jesus, but based off everything I “believed,” I thought he never loved me back. Then it hit me; It was man that spewed hate, not the Lord.I grew up in an era of miseducation, misinterpretation and ‘fake prophets’ that unfortunately, persists today. I vividly remember hearing minister after minister telling congregations that, “homosexual conduct should be illegal.” Or that “Homosexual behavior is a crime against nature, an inherent evil, and act so heinous that it defies one’s ability to describe it.” These same ministers also preached about LGBTQ folks going to hell and all dying of HIV/AIDS. Now if any of these quotes sound familiar to you, it’s because they are also the words of Roy Moore, the GOP nominee for Senator from the State of Alabama. Sadly, these hateful quotes and backward beliefs rooted in hearts of men, rather than words or scriptures of God have found their way into policy. Take Mississippi for example, where it is now legal for religious organizations to decline employment, housing, or services to same-sex couples. Also, the bill allows individuals working in medical services to refuse a transgender person’s request for gender reassignment surgery.Mississ’’’ippi’s anti-LGBT laws seem minor when you think about what else is happening under the Trump Administration. President Trump has attempted to ban honorable trans-people from serving in our military, his Department of Education has reversed protections for LGBTQ students at school. And a couple of weeks ago, the United States was one of 13 nations, including some of the most repressive countries on the globe, to oppose a United Nations motion condemning the death penalty for those in same-sex relationships.Trump, Mississippi lawmakers, and like-minded individuals have selectively interpreted and reframed the will of God to further the will of their political party. But, true Christianity doesn’t know one political party or another. Jesus didn’t die as Republican or Democrat. Jesus believed in pure and unconditional love of everyone, not just a chosen few. Christianity—and its tenets of social justice, helping those less fortunate, striving toward peace—is for everyone.For far too long, we have sat quietly and let folks like Alabama’s Roy Moore, James Dodson, Jerry Falewell Jr., Paula White, and others wrap themselves in Christianity to spew hate, bigotry, white supremacy, and demonstrate un-Christlike behavior. Now is the time for that era to come to an end. Jesus is love. Love and hate don’t mix.I am a Christian, and I know there are many more like me. We must all stand up and reject false political prophets, and speak up and act out in the way fitting a follower of Christ who loves and looks out for the interest of all people, not a chosen few.Richard Fowler is the youngest syndicated progressive and/or African-American radio host in the United States.

62,POLITICS,Trump Is The Worst Possible Messenger For The Rising Anti-Monopoly Movement,Zach Carter and Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-monopoly-att-time-warner_us_5a03846be4b0937b510f6f34,"The merger between AT&T and Time Warner is a problem, with or without CNN.",2017-11-08,President Donald Trump has made no secret of his animosity toward CNN. Using it as a stick in any federal approval of an AT&T-Time Warner merger would not be a healthy sign.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0386101c00002600b33f51.jpeg?cache=WXJyaBjUPi&ops=crop_11_73_2989_1142%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"The only encouraging ideological trend in the United States over the past two years has been the nation’s steady awakening to the political problems posed by monopoly power. Corporate mega-mergers, once viewed as an inevitability carrying, at most, modest implications for consumer prices, are coming to be understood as a threat to the foundations of democracy. Companies that control access to information ― Facebook, Google, telecom giants and media conglomerates ― are suddenly receiving a level of scrutiny from politicians and the general public they have not experienced in decades.The proposed $85.4 billion merger between AT&T and Time Warner should be intolerable. AT&T already controls a huge swath of the broadband market. It also owns DirecTV, a television distribution network that carries hundreds of channels. The Time Warner deal would add the Warner Bros. film studio, the Warner Bros. Television empire and DC Entertainment (a vehicle for Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and other superheroes), along with HBO, Cinemax and the array of Turner Broadcasting properties: TNT, TBS, TruTV, Turner Classic Movies, Adult Swim, Cartoon Network, HLN and CNN. No single entity should have that much power. Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Al Franken (D-Minn.) and several other Senate Democrats have raised serious objections to the deal. Anti-monopoly experts have been attacking it ever since it was announced. “This merger would give one bad company way too much power,” wrote Candace Clement, free press campaign director for the advocacy group Free Press. The federal government has been greenlighting mergers like this for years. In 2011, the Obama administration approved Comcast’s acquisition of NBCUniversal, allowing allowing the cable provider to swallow CNBC and MSNBC. Nevertheless, there are established legal theories that indicate these deals should not go through. AT&T would have an incentive to create problems for competitors of TNT, TBS, TruTV and CNN either over its DirecTV television network or through its broadband and wireless services. On Wednesday afternoon, The New York Times, Politico and The Financial Times published reports declaring that the Department of Justice was holding up the deal. The stories, all posted within minutes of each other, indicated that the DOJ was considering forcing AT&T to sell off CNN as a condition for approval. CNBC and The New York Times indicated that the Justice Department had told AT&T it would have to sell off either DirecTV or the entire Turner broadcasting suite. But anonymous quotes to FT and Politico were more ominous: “The only reason you would divest CNN would be to kowtow to the president because he doesn’t like the coverage,” one source told Politico. “It would send a chilling message to every news organization in the country.”The Justice Department told CNN’s Brian Stelter that AT&T “privately offered to sell CNN” during talks, an allegation AT&T Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson denied. DOJ insisted to HuffPost that it “does not comment on any pending investigation” and that it is “committed to carrying out its duties in accordance with the laws and the facts.” It’s no secret that President Donald Trump loathes CNN. He has assailed the network all year as “fake news,” ridiculed its reporters at press briefings and even posted video online of himself body-slamming a man with a CNN logo superimposed over his face. Trump’s consistent attack on the press has had obvious authoritarian overtones, and interfering in the business operations of a network he doesn’t like is not a healthy sign. But neither is the prospect of a duopoly governed by AT&T-CNN and Comcast-MSNBC, even if Trump-friendly Fox News might end up getting the short end of the stick. “We have four decades with nonpolitical scientific merger control, and look at the economy we’re living in,” noted Columbia University law professor Tim Wu at an antitrust event in Washington on Wednesday. “We really need to get serious about this problem.”The anti-monopoly movement in the United States is ascendent. Silicon Valley behemoths are targeting groups like the Open Markets Institute for a reason. But the fact that Trump has explicitly assailed just about every major media enterprise except Fox News and Breitbart makes him a uniquely terrible messenger for a gospel concerned with free speech. The AT&T-Time Warner deal should die. Not, however, without some skepticism about the motivations behind its execution.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misidentified Randall Stephenson as the chief financial officer of AT&T. He is the chief executive officer."

When asked by Vanity Fair at the event whom he would most like to profile, Talese said that it would be Spacey. And while it’s not inherently wrong to profile complex and even predatory public figures, his reason for wanting to do so was troubling. Talese spoke sympathetically of the actor, who, in the wake of multiple allegations of harassment, has been dropped by Netflix and is currently seeking treatment for “sex addiction” in Arizona. “I would like to ask [Spacey] how it feels to lose a lifetime of success and hard work all because of 10 minutes of indiscretion 10 years or more ago,” Talese said. The “indiscretion” Talese referred to was the accusation made by actor Anthony Rapp last week. According to Rapp, Spacey made a sexual advance toward him in 1986 when Rapp was just 14 years old ― and Spacey was 26. “I feel so sad, and I hate that actor that ruined this guy’s career,” Talese said of Rapp. “So, OK, it happened 10 years ago ... Jesus, suck it up once in a while!” Not only are Talese’s comments disrespectful to survivors of sexual trauma, he also failed to acknowledge that there are actually many other allegations against Spacey, and they occurred over decades, proving a pattern of abuse and predation rather than a quick 10-minute “indiscretion.”He also went on to say that “all of us” have done something worth being ashamed of. “You know something, all of us in this room at one time or another did something we’re ashamed of,” he said. “The Dalai Lama has done something he’s ashamed of.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), fell short in his run for mayor of Atlanta on Tuesday, denying progressive activists a clean sweep in the Southeastern cities that have held mayoral elections in the past year.City Councilwoman Keisha Lance Bottoms and City Councilwoman Mary Norwood will proceed to the runoff, having earned 26 percent and 21 percent of the vote, respectively.Former City Councilwoman Cathy Woolard received 17 percent of the vote, followed by former city manager Peter Aman with 11 percent and Fort with 10 percent.The outcome means that Atlantans likely will not have the opportunity to dramatically break with the substance and style of the city’s present leadership at a time when working-class and poor residents feel increasingly threatened by gentrification.“Vince Fort’s election was always a huge uphill climb considering the huge amounts of money from developers and contractors some of his opponents are spending,” said Joe Dinkin, national communications director for the Working Families Party, a progressive organization campaigning for Fort. “No matter the outcome, no matter the ultimate mayor, Vincent Fort ensured that the issues of working-class people and poor people, people of color in Atlanta, were at the center of the debate, and all the candidates are gonna have to be responsive to those.”Fort, a ball of passionate energy with a mustache and black-frame glasses, rose to the rank of Democratic whip over two decades in the state Senate. He’d promised an about-face in city development policies that, he argued, prioritize wealthy developers over the city’s working families.Fort frequently pointed to his record as the author of Georgia’s landmark predatory lending law, and his decades of street activism in defense of families facing eviction, as evidence that he was the only mayoral contender who could be trusted to fight for ordinary people.“This is serious business, because we’ve gone from 20 percent gentrified to 70 percent gentrified at something like 5 percent a year,” Fort told HuffPost in an extended interview at his Atlanta campaign offices. “And if the wrong person gets elected on Nov. 7, guess what? You’re going to have by 2021, the end of the next administration, it could very well be impossible to revert. That’s how high the stakes are.”Liberal challengers have unseated mayoral incumbents in Jackson, Mississippi, and Birmingham, Alabama, this year. A progressive reformer is also favored to become mayor of New Orleans in a Nov. 18 runoff.Left-leaning organizations like Sanders’ Our Revolution and the Working Families Party were hoping a Fort victory would add Atlanta to their Southern winning streak.But Atlanta, a city of nearly half a million people that serves as the de facto commercial capital of the region, is notoriously impervious to populist politics.Much was at stake in the Atlanta race ― and the city’s potent business community knew it. Fort promised to negotiate a better deal for Atlanta workers and end corrupt practices that reward crony contractors, including through the institution of an inspector general at City Hall. The city oversees contracting at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, the busiest airport on the planet.Consequently, as Dinkin noted, Fort’s rivals raised far more money than he did. As of the start of the month, the field’s two leaders, City Councilwomen Norwood and Lance Bottoms, raised $1.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively.Of Lance Bottoms’ total haul, $23,525 of it came from people associated with airport contractor Master ConcessionAir, who used fuzzy accounting to get around individual contribution limits.Fort, by contrast, raised $506,000 ― much of it in small increments.Fort also faced vocal opposition from Mayor Kasim Reed (D), a political rival of Fort’s who is backing Lance Bottoms. In February, Reed called Fort “one of the most disappointing human beings” he’d ever met, and subsequently went after Fort for his personal financial troubles at a press conference.The insurgent nature of Fort’s campaign was apparent until the very end. On Tuesday afternoon, Atlanta police arrested Tim Franzen, Fort’s community outreach director and a longtime housing justice organizer in the city, just outside campaign headquarters.A run of Franzen’s tag revealed that he was driving with a suspended license, city police told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.Fort told HuffPost this might be the case -- but, he said, it still wasn't clear why police pulled Franzen over in the first place.As a former leader of Occupy Atlanta and frequent participant in Atlanta’s civil disobedience actions, Franzen has alleged that the police routinely harass him and target him for unjustified arrests.Tuesday’s arrest “reeks of politics,” Fort told HuffPost, calling it an example of the kind of injustice that inspired his mayoral run.“The Bill of Rights unfortunately does not extend to all parts of the city and to all people,” Fort said. “If you’re an activist and you stand up against the establishment, you’ll be targeted.”Carlos Campos, an Atlanta police spokesman, called Fort’s claim “patently false and absurd on its face.”“Mr. Franzen was driving on a suspended license, which is illegal,” Campos told the Journal-Constitution. “It is the only reason his vehicle was stopped.”The Atlanta Police Department did not respond to a request for comment for this article."
67,RELIGION,Bullied For Wearing A Turban,"Helga Luest, M.A., ContributorExpert on Trauma Informed Approaches & Violence Prevention; Ad...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-harmful-effects-of-bullying-on-sikh-american-children_us_5a03887fe4b0204d0c17140f,"Bullying in America is a serious public health concern, with one in five schoolchildren experiencing the negative consequences",2017-11-08,<p>MaegenMarie Jones at the International Bullying Prevention Association Conference </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0389461c00002800b33f57.jpg?ops=crop_152_38_2675_3038%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Bullying in America is a serious public health concern, with one in five schoolchildren experiencing the negative consequences. Kids who are bullied may develop feelings of sadness, loneliness, and isolation. Bullying can also make it more difficult to perform well in school, and it has been noted as a risk factor for suicide. For Sikh-American children, wearing a turban can be seen by other children as a significant difference from how they appear and often becomes the focus of commentary and bullying.The negative consequences of bullying has the attention of many federal agencies, community organizations and socially minded entrepreneurs who work together and convene to discuss new research, concerning data and creative approaches to prevention. At the International Bullying Prevention Association conference, attendees had the unique opportunity by the American Sikh Council to receive a turban. Their goal was to give attendees a glimpse into what it might be like to walk a day in the shoes of someone who is a practicing Sikh. MaegenMarie Jones, one of the conference attendees, eagerly stepped up to experience the turban and build her understanding of Sikh religion and culture.The Sikh-American volunteers prepared a saffron cloth to wrap around her head – a process taking 4-5 minutes. When they were done, MaegenMarie left the conference to return to her hotel room. When she reached the elevator, a man and a woman gave her an odd glance and then got off and told her they would wait for the next. For MaeganMarie, she believed this was a statement regarding her appearance and the turban. It was the first time she ever felt discriminated, judged, and seen as different.The all-volunteer American Sikh Council has a presence at the International Bullying Prevention Association every year in an effort to educate those who are actively working on prevention to consider the cultural and religious targeting they experience.The Sikh-American community of 750,000 in the United States is not often thought of as at risk for bullying and discrimination, and they are generally not included in related research or culturally specific programming. Over half of all Sikh-American children, however, report being bullied in school – and even more so if the child is wearing a turban. More boys are targeted than girls, and the American Sikh Council notes that some Sikh children are excluded from sport activities. They offer some steps schools can take to help like educating teachers and students about Sikh faith, informing parents about how best to report bullying, and providing students support when they tell an adult about an incident.The turban is part of a religious uniform intended to cover hair, promote equality, and affirm the Sikh identity. Sikh theology teaches that hard work brings a truth from within. Some of the core values include Kirat karo – earn an honest living; Wand chhako – share your earnings with others while selflessly serving others; and Naam japp – focus on pure virtues like truth, honesty, integrity, and morality, while remembering the Creator at all times. These tenants come from a religious foundation and commitment to peace and charity. However, in a country where the Sikh population is quite small, religious and cultural practices have been a target by individuals who focus on the differences as an avenue to shame, hurt, or exclude.For MaegenMarie, the experience of wearing a Sikh turban for one day gave her deeper insight into the experiences of the Sikh population. Educators, community groups, and organizations working on bullying and violence prevention also need to include Sikh children and recognize them as a high-risk group. Greater efforts to educate kids and to nurture acceptance and inclusion is needed. Getting to know people and their practices is a meaningful way to build understanding, acceptance, and perhaps new friendships as well.About the AuthorHelga Luest currently works for a government contractor and manages a number of federal projects related to behavioral health, trauma, and violence prevention.

Not that there’s anything wrong with that, but it’s just not us. My husband and I learned all three of our kids’ biological sexes via ultrasound and we planned accordingly. I dressed my boys in blue, my girl in pink.I’d always hoped to have a child of each gender. And God, in only God’s divine way, was brilliant enough to give me one of each: a cisgender male, Jack, born in 2000, a cisgender female. Kate, born in 2002, and a few years later, when my third and last child was born, well, God threw all caution to the wind and decided to confuse everyone and make the ride just a little more fun.Charlie arrived in 2006 and was assigned male at birth, but began expressing stereotypical female from the age of 2.5 years old. Charlie always preferred playing with Kate’s old ballet costumes and Barbies over anything Jack had in his room — from Legos to trucks, tools to action figures. Charlie had no interest in toddler, gender neutral, or typical boy toys. But Charlie would spend hours in Kate’s room, sitting at her tiny plastic pink vanity table, applying fake makeup and doing hair.Once while we were playing, at the very young age of almost 3, Charlie casually revealed to me, “Mommy, you know I’m only a boy ‘cause of my parts, right?” At the time I knew nothing of transgender people, let alone trans kids. But I knew that was a really profound statement for my toddler to make. So I started watching and listening harder and more closely.A year later, Charlie was obsessed with Dorothy and The Wizard of Oz, Rapunzel, and still, princess dress up. Still, showing absolutely no interest in any type of typical boy toys. Yes, we thought it was a phase. But by age 4, I started thinking, “Oh I know what this is. I have a gay kid. Charlie’s going to grow up and eventually tell me: Mom, I’m gay. And I’ll know exactly what to do because I grew up with so many gay friends in the theatre community!” Not that I thought my child was aware of sexual orientation yet, but I believe people are born the way they are, and part of that pre-programmed makeup includes their sexual orientation. However, I didn’t know about the complexities of gender, gender identity, and gender expression yet.After years of reading & research, listening, paying attention (and struggling to find resources to support this type of child) Charlie watched something with me about a gender creative boy in California, and Charlie said, “that’s me!” And so it stuck. In 4th grade, Charlie began letting people know, “I’m gender creative,” and attempting to explain what that meant when they questioned, “are you a boy or a girl?” The search for a label and identity seemed so important to my child, who was struggling to make friends that year, and dealing with other boys saying “you’re gay,” and much worse.By 5th grade, Charlie had begun rejecting everything remotely masculine, including clothing, shoes, and accessories that appeared masculine. Charlie went from just wearing a sparkly “girls” backpack and pink & purple Twinkle Toe Sketchers, to growing a longer head of hair, wearing floral headbands, and dressing in legit girls clothing, from girls clothing stores, head to toe. Labels and identity began being less important, though we were still using “he/him” pronouns and referring to Charlie as “our son.” The moment 5th grade ended, though, that was the last time Charlie wanted to be referred to as “he/him/our son.” At the LGBT Center, where my husband & I founded and run a group for TGNC (trans and gender non-conforming) children on Charlie’s behalf, Charlie learned about pronouns. That’s when Charlie’s fierce adoption of “they/them” began. Now, as an 11-year-old, Charlie goes by “they/them;” however, Charlie won’t correct people who use “she/her.” In fact, Charlie is referred to as “she/her” by almost everyone in public, and by many of their teachers. Charlie likes that because Charlie still strongly rejects “he/him.”Earlier in the summer, we went back-to-school shoe shopping and the sales clerk kept referring to Charlie as “your daughter,” “she,” and “her.” It was really the first time it happened so overtly. It happened a couple of times before in restaurants, but for some reason it seemed more ambiguous in those places - maybe because the whole family was there, and as talkative as we are, we couldn’t always be sure which one of us the server was addressing. But in that shoe store it was just Charlie and me, and everyone thought we were mother and daughter. When it first happened in a restaurant, I had asked Charlie, “what do you want us to say or do next time when someone assumes you’re a girl and refers to you as a girl?” Charlie said, “Mom. Just roll with it.” So that’s what I did in the shoe store. Didn’t correct anyone, didn’t bat an eyelash, went along and used “she/her” in public myself for the first time, for Charlie. The cashier rang us up and I asked Charlie to please take one of the three bags. They had chosen a pair of tall black boots, short gold boots, pink & purple sneakers, and a pair of red high heels (an impulse buy, but on the clearance rack for $3.00, how do you say no to that?!) Charlie instinctively reached for the large bag with the boots and the heels. The cashier said, “She knows which bag has the good stuff!” I replied, “Yes, she sure does.” On the way out to the parking lot, Charlie said, “Mom, that’s exactly what I meant by ‘just roll with it.’ Good job! Thank you!”For me, this originally felt so odd and foreign. I wanted to have control in these situations. I wanted to have a plan A and a plan B, and I wanted to know specifically what I would say or do if both Plan A and B backfired. But this is why we have a gender therapist. And she has told us, with 20+ years experience counseling trans and gender non-conforming clients, we’re doing exactly what we’re supposed to do: follow the child’s lead. Don’t needle with too many questions. Let go of that need for control. And I just have to trust that she’s handling all the role-playing, what-if scenarios, and coping mechanisms in response to the insults and slander that is unique to this community of people. Having known my child for 11+ years now, it all makes perfect sense to me, but I understand why others hearing our story — which is just a small window into our complex lives — think we are not being parents. Those who think that simply don’t know. They don’t know how much time and money we’ve spent on therapy for the whole family, how much blood, sweat, and tears we’ve put into our own research and workshop attending, how many nights we’ve stayed up too late comforting a child screaming in anxiety over things we now know were caused by gender dysphoria.I understand that people think children are confused over gender. But gender dysphoria is not the same thing as “confusion.” TGNC kids aren’t confused. They know exactly who they are, they just lack the vocabulary and the cognitive ability to explain it so that us adults can understand it. And that’s rightfully frustrating for them.There’s also a perception that gender is an “adult” topic, that children are too young to know or understand these things. Part of the flaw in that thinking is the assumption that gender identity and sexual orientation are the same. They aren’t. But also, if every cis person thinks about their own gender story, they’ll likely respond they didn’t know when or how they knew they were male or female, they just knew, and had that internal sense of identity from a very young age. The same is true for transgender people (which includes gender non-conforming, and non-binary people). They’ve always known. And though it may seem like it, there aren’t more and more of them popping up everywhere all of a sudden; this isn’t a new phenomenon. Native Americans have always had “two spirit” people, whose gender identity exists beyond binary male or female. Two spirits were some of the most respected and revered people in their tribes. Many other cultures and religions recognize more than two genders as well, including early versions of the Bible and Christianity, and classical Judaism, to name a few.The reason we seem to be hearing more TGNC people’s stories now is because we have the internet, we have experience gathering and organizing groups on social media, and we have a whole generation of parents who watched their LGBTQ friends get kicked out of their homes for being LGBTQ in the 1980s, and we now realize the amount of harm that did. We want to do better. And for all the grief both the internet and social media get, they are capable of connecting people like never before. The internet is ultimately helping the TGNC community because it’s the one bridge that has the potential to be able to finally connect this entire community. Though TGNC people have existed forever, most of them in America have felt isolated and alone; they’ve hidden their authentic selves in a closet of shame, and they’ve been forced to live a lie. Today, if not for social media, this huge community of amazingly gifted people otherwise might not have ever connected. Also, the internet is driving awareness of TGNC-related issues with lightning speed, in an unprecedented manner. This is wonderful because knowledge is power.For all the progress we’ve made, however, our work isn’t done yet. As a parent raising this type of child, I can bear witness that we get all kinds of ill-informed accusations and harmful motives ascribed to us by complete strangers. But when people have their knee-jerk reactions, this is where they need to step back, make conscious efforts not to judge, listen, and just trust that us parents raising TGNC kids have done our research and our homework — enough to have earned an honorary Master’s degree on the topic — and we do actually know what we’re doing. By advocating for and supporting our TGNC kids exactly as they are, we are doing everything within our power to allow them to live their truth and have confidence in it. Trust that we know what’s considered best practice in raising this type of child, we know what the statistics regarding transgender youth and suicide show, and we know trans people are the most at-risk group of marginalized people to self-harm, attempt suicide, or complete suicide. When coupled with a non-supportive, non-accepting family, the suicide statistics for trans people are especially alarming. Add in the intersectionality of being black and a trans female, and the statistics of death by suicide, violence, and murder are overwhelming. Trans people as a whole are most likely to commit suicide or be murdered because of gender-based victimization, discrimination, bullying, violence, being rejected by family, friends, and community; harassment by intimate partner(s), family members, police; public discrimination, and ill treatment at health-care systems. These are the major risk factors that influence the suicidal behavior among transgender people. These factors penetrate them literally everywhere across society.Conversely, we know that a loving, accepting family is often the line between life or death for trans kids. But even when a trans person has an all-accepting family around them, it’s still not enough, because hatred towards this population is so ingrained in society, which is inherently misogynistic. We need look no further than the stories of trans youth like Jay Griffin to know we’re not doing enough for these kids. And because we love our children so unconditionally and want them to live, we fight for the rights to educate others, and to support our TGNC kids. We are in tune with the politics of the day — because we have to be — and we’re aware of things like how the LGBTQ Suicide Hotline calls from transgender youth have spiked — more than doubled — under Trump’s presidency.This is in direct correlation with today’s political climate, one where the President of the United States has surrounded himself with advisers and cabinet members who are notoriously racist, homophobic, and transphobic. We have a political climate in which it’s perfectly acceptable for a rich white man who brags of sexual assault to get elected President, and not only not have to give up his personal Twitter account, but is also allowed to use it for issuing ridiculous, non-enforceable, but still harmful mandates such as the transgender military ban.The death of Leelah Alcorn, one of the most infamous trans youth suicides, sheds light on so many issues still plaguing transgender youth, and the micro (and macro) aggressions they endure. She took her life because she felt no sense of hope. It’s almost as if in 2014, she could foresee what this country would go through politically, how the pendulum would swing too far the other way, reversing social progress, by the time she would be graduating from college. Indeed there are many days now where things seem hopeless, but we have to find a sliver of hope, and hold on to that. It’s ironic that some people accuse parents like me, who are advocates for our TGNC children, of being “child abusers” simply for allowing our children to explore gender, and advocating publicly for the world to shift its collective mindset a bit. Unconditionally loving a TGNC child exactly as they are, embracing that psychology, and advocating for them is quite the opposite of child abuse. A parent has to have a very mature sensibility and understanding of unconditional love in order to let go of their wants and needs for their child’s life, to let go of their hopes, dreams and perceptions of what the child’s gender should look like. This type of parenting is not for the weak. Leelah’s parents said in interviews they “loved (him) unconditionally,” but during those same interviews disrespected Leelah by using the birth name they gave her based off of her sex assigned at birth, a.k.a., her “dead name,” and they refused to use female pronouns when talking about their child. This is not showing unconditional love. Their child took her own life because her parents refused to acknowledge her gender dysphoria, and even in death they continued to disrespect her in that way. Also, Leelah had to mask as gay, because that was easier for her parents to accept than trans. This is still happening in families everywhere today. In my advocacy, I’ve talked to numerous adults who tell me that coming out as gay was just easier than having to admit they were transgender, or that if their parents had been as accepting back then, they wouldn’t have had to hide their authentic selves and lead a forced, fake life.In her suicide note, Leelah pleaded for her death to be counted in the number of transgender people who committed suicide that year (2014). “The only way I will rest in peace,” Leelah wrote, “is if one day transgender people aren’t treated the way I was, they’re treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights. Gender needs to be taught about in schools, the earlier the better.” She then begged us to “Fix society. Please.”To my own child, to Leelah, and Jay, to all my friends who got kicked out so long ago, and to all the other TGNC kids out there right now, please hang on. We’re working on fixing it."

Not that there’s anything wrong with that, but it’s just not us. My husband and I learned all three of our kids’ biological sexes via ultrasound and we planned accordingly. I dressed my boys in blue, my girl in pink.I’d always hoped to have a child of each gender. And God, in only God’s divine way, was brilliant enough to give me one of each: a cisgender male, Jack, born in 2000, a cisgender female. Kate, born in 2002, and a few years later, when my third and last child was born, well, God threw all caution to the wind and decided to confuse everyone and make the ride just a little more fun.Charlie arrived in 2006 and was assigned male at birth, but began expressing stereotypical female from the age of 2.5 years old. Charlie always preferred playing with Kate’s old ballet costumes and Barbies over anything Jack had in his room — from Legos to trucks, tools to action figures. Charlie had no interest in toddler, gender neutral, or typical boy toys. But Charlie would spend hours in Kate’s room, sitting at her tiny plastic pink vanity table, applying fake makeup and doing hair.Once while we were playing, at the very young age of almost 3, Charlie casually revealed to me, “Mommy, you know I’m only a boy ‘cause of my parts, right?” At the time I knew nothing of transgender people, let alone trans kids. But I knew that was a really profound statement for my toddler to make. So I started watching and listening harder and more closely.A year later, Charlie was obsessed with Dorothy and The Wizard of Oz, Rapunzel, and still, princess dress up. Still, showing absolutely no interest in any type of typical boy toys. Yes, we thought it was a phase. But by age 4, I started thinking, “Oh I know what this is. I have a gay kid. Charlie’s going to grow up and eventually tell me: Mom, I’m gay. And I’ll know exactly what to do because I grew up with so many gay friends in the theatre community!” Not that I thought my child was aware of sexual orientation yet, but I believe people are born the way they are, and part of that pre-programmed makeup includes their sexual orientation. However, I didn’t know about the complexities of gender, gender identity, and gender expression yet.After years of reading & research, listening, paying attention (and struggling to find resources to support this type of child) Charlie watched something with me about a gender creative boy in California, and Charlie said, “that’s me!” And so it stuck. In 4th grade, Charlie began letting people know, “I’m gender creative,” and attempting to explain what that meant when they questioned, “are you a boy or a girl?” The search for a label and identity seemed so important to my child, who was struggling to make friends that year, and dealing with other boys saying “you’re gay,” and much worse.By 5th grade, Charlie had begun rejecting everything remotely masculine, including clothing, shoes, and accessories that appeared masculine. Charlie went from just wearing a sparkly “girls” backpack and pink & purple Twinkle Toe Sketchers, to growing a longer head of hair, wearing floral headbands, and dressing in legit girls clothing, from girls clothing stores, head to toe. Labels and identity began being less important, though we were still using “he/him” pronouns and referring to Charlie as “our son.” The moment 5th grade ended, though, that was the last time Charlie wanted to be referred to as “he/him/our son.” At the LGBT Center, where my husband & I founded and run a group for TGNC (trans and gender non-conforming) children on Charlie’s behalf, Charlie learned about pronouns. That’s when Charlie’s fierce adoption of “they/them” began. Now, as an 11-year-old, Charlie goes by “they/them;” however, Charlie won’t correct people who use “she/her.” In fact, Charlie is referred to as “she/her” by almost everyone in public, and by many of their teachers. Charlie likes that because Charlie still strongly rejects “he/him.”Earlier in the summer, we went back-to-school shoe shopping and the sales clerk kept referring to Charlie as “your daughter,” “she,” and “her.” It was really the first time it happened so overtly. It happened a couple of times before in restaurants, but for some reason it seemed more ambiguous in those places - maybe because the whole family was there, and as talkative as we are, we couldn’t always be sure which one of us the server was addressing. But in that shoe store it was just Charlie and me, and everyone thought we were mother and daughter. When it first happened in a restaurant, I had asked Charlie, “what do you want us to say or do next time when someone assumes you’re a girl and refers to you as a girl?” Charlie said, “Mom. Just roll with it.” So that’s what I did in the shoe store. Didn’t correct anyone, didn’t bat an eyelash, went along and used “she/her” in public myself for the first time, for Charlie.

70,POLITICS,Democrats Find Catharsis A Year After Hillary Clinton's Loss,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-one-year-later_us_5a031201e4b09205305966f3,The movement that formed in the wake of her loss helped propel Democrats to election victories.,2017-11-08,Democrats won big a year after Hillary Clinton's election loss.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a033dbd140000e84dd7f782.jpeg?cache=dvENE5Ugul&ops=crop_10_118_4989_2944%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"It’s been a good five years or so since Democrats were truly happy on a big election night. 2016 certainly wasn’t one of those times. Democrats watched in horror as Donald Trump won the presidency, a scenario that many people around the country thought was impossible. And all the talk about potentially retaking the Senate evaporated as Republicans won races that seemed like long shots. Most Democrats point to 2012, when Barack Obama was re-elected, as the last happy time. One Democrat reminded HuffPost of 2013, when Terry McAuliffe won the Virginia gubernatorial race, making history as a Democrat able to win in the state despite the same party being in the White House.Regardless, it’s been a while.So many Democrats couldn’t believe their eyes Tuesday when they saw the string of blue victories across the country. The party won the gubernatorial race in Virginia by a large margin. It took the governor’s seat in New Jersey away from GOP control. It won far more seats in the Virginia House of Delegates than anyone expected. And it flipped seats and had historic wins elsewhere.The wins showed the limits of Trump’s brand of politics and validated the thousands of people around the country who joined the resistance after last year’s election. And they seemed to provide some redemption for Hillary Clinton, who, in her concession speech, implored her supporters to keep fighting. “There is a lot more work still to do, but as anniversaries go, this was something of a catharsis,” said Brian Fallon, who served as the Clinton campaign spokesman. “Republicans like [Virginia gubernatorial candidate] Ed Gillespie made a deliberate choice to put Trumpism on the ballot, making the Democratic success yesterday all the more redemptive. Everyday people are stepping up to run for office and making a statement that they will not let their country be defined by what happened on November 8, 2016, and thank God for that.”Democrats were worried a Gillespie win would encourage more Republicans to run on a platform like Trump’s. Gillespie played up the nativist rhetoric that pushed Trump to victory in 2016. And the president touted Gillespie’s candidacy, even recording robocalls to boost him.Between Tuesday’s losses and the defeat of Trump’s preferred candidate in the Alabama Senate GOP primary just over a month ago, the Republican Party ― and the president himself ― is learning the limits of his appeal. Trump boasted last year that if he stood in the middle of New York’s Fifth Avenue and shot someone, he still wouldn’t lose any supporters. That twisted scenario may be true (luckily it hasn’t been tested), but it’s clear that Trump at least isn’t invincible. As Tuesday showed, his actions do have consequences, and people who are repulsed by what he does will step up and try to stop him.Tuesday’s victories were aided in large part by the grassroots movement that formed in the wake of Trump’s win. Those groups have quickly become part of the progressive infrastructure and work closely with the local Democratic parties.In Virginia, for example, there are more than 180 active Indivisible chapters that made more than 600,000 calls around Tuesday’s elections. “The sweeping victories in races that had previously been considered unwinnable show that the progressive movement is an energized, locally led and transformative force,” said Maria Urbina, Indivisible’s political director. “Politicians who fail to stand up against Trump should take notice, because we’re just getting started. A progressive wave is coming, and 2018 is around the corner.”Women have led the resistance. They mobilized for the Women’s March in January, and a record number of women have been running for public office. There were some moments of comeuppance in Tuesday night’s victories. Danica Roem won a seat in the Virginia House of Delegates, becoming the first openly transgender lawmaker in the state’s history. She defeated Del. Bob Marshall (R), who introduced legislation that would have prohibited transgender students from using the bathroom of their choice.Democrat Ashley Bennett won a seat as a freeholder in Atlantic County, New Jersey. She was inspired to run after seeing a Republican politician joke about whether the Women’s March would be “over in time for them to cook dinner.” That man is the incumbent she defeated Tuesday."
71,POLITICS,"Watch Out, Donald Trump. Here Come The Democrats.","Nick Baumann, Amanda Terkel, and Igor Bobic",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-wave-2017_us_5a0267e1e4b092053058cdad,"In Virginia, New Jersey and Washington, a blue wave rises.",2017-11-08,Democrat Ralph Northam celebrates his victory over Ed Gillespie to be governor of Virginia.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a029b6617000021007966b4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"FAIRFAX, Va. ― The Democratic Party romped to victories across the country Tuesday, gaining key state legislative seats, two governorships and full control of the state governments of New Jersey and Washington, where they’ll have wide power to enact their agenda.In one sense, the wins should have been expected: President Donald Trump is extremely unpopular, and the party that holds the White House usually does worse in congressional, state and local elections in years when the president isn’t on the ballot. And the victories were expected in some cases. In New Jersey, Democrat Phil Murphy, a former Goldman Sachs banker, consistently led in the polls and will now be the next governor. But elsewhere, outcomes were more uncertain. Many Democratic activists were worried that the party was going to let the Virginia governor’s mansion slip from its grasp. Concern that Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam was failing to excite the base, along with a fear-mongering anti-immigrant campaign run by Republican Ed Gillespie, led to concerns it would be a repeat of the 2016 presidential race.Northam, however, sailed to victory Tuesday, guaranteeing Democrats a seat at the table when state legislative and congressional districts get redrawn in 2020. The party won the races for lieutenant governor and attorney general, too. The night was validation for the many activists around the country who joined the resistance after Trump’s win and have been feverishly working at the grassroots to mobilize the party’s base. There’s no doubt that the victories will provide a jolt of energy for what’s coming in the 2018 midterm elections.“Today’s progressive victories in Virginia make one thing clear: A newly awakened grassroots movement is rising up to reject Trump’s politics of hate and reclaim political power,” said Maria Urbina, the political director of the progressive Indivisible movement, which has more than 180 active groups in Virginia. Democrats also saw the wins as a rejection of the type of nationalism championed by Trump and his former aide, Breitbart News Executive Chairman Steve Bannon, who maintained that a win by Gillespie in Virginia would prove that “Trumpism without Trump can show the way forward.”“Tonight, the message for Democrats and the country is that fear and division and hatred do not work,” Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) said. “They don’t work here in Virginia, and they’re not going to work in Virginia.”Trump attempted to distance himself from the crushing GOP losses Tuesday night, tweeting from South Korea that Gillespie “worked hard but did not embrace me or what I stand for.”Almost no one expected Democrats to do as well as they did in the Virginia House of Delegates. Democrats targeted the 17 GOP-held districts where Democratic presidential rival Hillary Clinton defeated Trump.

Republicans have controlled the state’s house of delegates for nearly two decades and held a 66-34 majority.

Last week, Virginia Democratic National Committeewoman Yasmine Taeb estimated that a pickup of six to eight seats would constitute a “success.” But by 9:30 p.m., Democrats had already picked up 14 Republican-held seats in the House of Delegates, with eight more in play.Northern Virginia, a Democratic stronghold, turned only bluer.

And the victories were expected in some cases. In New Jersey, Democrat Phil Murphy, a former Goldman Sachs banker, consistently led in the polls and will now be the next governor. But elsewhere, outcomes were more uncertain. Many Democratic activists were worried that the party was going to let the Virginia governor’s mansion slip from its grasp. Concern that Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam was failing to excite the base, along with a fear-mongering anti-immigrant campaign run by Republican Ed Gillespie, led to concerns it would be a repeat of the 2016 presidential race.Northam, however, sailed to victory Tuesday, guaranteeing Democrats a seat at the table when state legislative and congressional districts get redrawn in 2020. The party won the races for lieutenant governor and attorney general, too. The night was validation for the many activists around the country who joined the resistance after Trump’s win and have been feverishly working at the grassroots to mobilize the party’s base. There’s no doubt that the victories will provide a jolt of energy for what’s coming in the 2018 midterm elections.“Today’s progressive victories in Virginia make one thing clear: A newly awakened grassroots movement is rising up to reject Trump’s politics of hate and reclaim political power,” said Maria Urbina, the political director of the progressive Indivisible movement, which has more than 180 active groups in Virginia. Democrats also saw the wins as a rejection of the type of nationalism championed by Trump and his former aide, Breitbart News Executive Chairman Steve Bannon, who maintained that a win by Gillespie in Virginia would prove that “Trumpism without Trump can show the way forward.”“Tonight, the message for Democrats and the country is that fear and division and hatred do not work,” Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) said. “They don’t work here in Virginia, and they’re not going to work in Virginia.”Trump attempted to distance himself from the crushing GOP losses Tuesday night, tweeting from South Korea that Gillespie “worked hard but did not embrace me or what I stand for.”Almost no one expected Democrats to do as well as they did in the Virginia House of Delegates. Democrats targeted the 17 GOP-held districts where Democratic presidential rival Hillary Clinton defeated Trump. Winning all of the seats would swing control of the chamber, but few thought it was possible. Republicans have controlled the state’s house of delegates for nearly two decades and held a 66-34 majority.

Thirty-four bodies were recovered from the water, 26 of them suspected to be teenagers from Nigeria. Most died while making the crossing toward Italy in rubber dinghies.IOM believes the girls may have been “murdered by traffickers in league with European sex merchants.”Salvatore Malfi, the prefect of the Italian port city of Salerno, was skeptical of this theory but said it’s too early to come to any conclusion about whether the girls were headed for prostitution. The girls traveled with other men in the dinghy, he said, which makes the theory less likely.“The sex trafficking routes are different,” he said. “Loading women onto a boat is too risky, the traffickers would not do it as they could lose all their ‘goods’ ― as they describe them ― in one fell swoop.”Italian authorities told CNN that they launched an investigation into the girls’ deaths Tuesday, carrying out autopsies to determine whether they had been victims of sexual abuse or torture. They were all between 14 and 18 years old, said Salerno police chief Lorena Ciccotti.More than 80 percent of Nigerian women who arrived in Italy by sea during the first six months of 2016 may have later become trafficking victims, a 2016 IOM report found.About 1,500 Nigerian women and girls made it to Italy in 2014, said Federico Soda, director of IOM’s Coordination Office for the Mediterranean. That number exploded in 2016 to 11,000. The route used by these women has become a death trap for people escaping their home countries, due to the torture they experience before reaching the water and the high fatality rate once en route to Italy.Smugglers operate vast networks across the Middle East and Africa, exploiting vulnerable people who pay to escape. Abuse, violence and detention are commonplace.Three-quarters of the migrant children interviewed in a February UNICEF report said they had experienced violence, harassment or aggression at the hands of adults. Almost half the women interviewed said they’d experienced sexual violence or abuse during their journey.A total of 154,609 migrants and refugees have entered Europe by sea this year, about 75 percent of whom used the Libya-Italy route, IOM said. The rest arrived via Greece, Spain or Cyprus. Almost 3,000 have died. "

Brown experienced years ago.In an interview with Entertainment Tonight, Brown explained that he and his wife, actress Ryan Michelle Bathe, welcomed their first child about six years ago at home in their bedroom. In the second season’s sixth episode, Brown’s character, Randall, experienced something similar with his wife, Beth (played by Susan Kelechi Watson), and in both cases, the home birth wasn’t planned. “It was this beautiful birthing center that we were going to go to, very civilized, and that went out the window at, like, 11 o’clock in the evening,” Bathe said about her birth experience.Brown added that Bathe had her first contraction at about 11 p.m., and their son “came into the world at 2:23 a.m., three hours and 23 minutes later.”“It never happens like that the first time. It’s not supposed to,” he said. “But my wife is not your ordinary human being, so she does extraordinary things all the time!”During the episode, Brown tweeted that the scene was “round 2” for him.While chatting with Entertainment Tonight, the actor, who will appear in “Black Panther,” explained that the scene came about after “This Is Us” creator Dan Fogelman heard about Brown’s experience. “He’s like, ‘Oh, we gotta put it in the show, we gotta put it in the show,’ and so they incorporated it into our life [on “This Is Us”] nine years ago,” Brown said.Brown has two sons with Bathe. In September, he joked on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” that his oldest sometimes mocks him about his Emmy win and fame.“He gives not a flying Fig Newton,” Brown said. "

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0228f41700002c017965cd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Completing the New York City Marathon is an accomplishment in and of itself. But two Sikh runners at this year’s race decided to dedicate this personal milestone to a bigger cause ― raising awareness about the fight for racial justice. Simran Jeet Singh, a professor of religion at Trinity University, and Jasdeep Singh, a physician from New York City, participated in the race on Sunday wearing t-shirts that paid homage to Colin Kaepernick, the former NFL quarterback whose #TakeAKnee protest movement has sparked conversations about police brutality towards black Americans. Simran said that he and Jasdeep were captivated by the “clarity and poise” that Kaepernick has brought to the issue, and wanted to honor the movement that the athlete has started. “I am committed to fighting anti-Black racism because my Sikh faith teaches me to confront any injustice I encounter in this world,” Simran told HuffPost in an email. “It is not an option to ignore the deep oppression that our Black sisters and brothers experience in America, and each of us has a responsibility to help ensure that we realize real equity in this country.”Sunday’s race was Simran’s sixth marathon, and his fifth time running the New York City marathon. In the past, Simran said that he often received racist comments while running the race. Last year, he heard people calling him a “dirty Muslim” or “that guy from ISIS” during the race. He said the 2017 race was the first time he’s run the New York City Marathon without receiving a single racist comment.Although Sikhs have been part of American society since the late 1800s, they have long been the targets of xenophobia and racism. Many Americans are unfamiliar with the religion, or mistakenly identify Sikhs as Muslims. Since the September 11 attacks, Sikh Americans have been the targets of racial profiling, bullying, and hate crimes.Simran said that he and Jasdeep, who ran his first marathon this year, often found themselves discussing social and political issues while training for the race.“We talked about how maintaining our Sikh identities in the world’s biggest race was a political statement in and of itself ― but we also talked about how we wanted to do something more explicit and more timely.”Kaepernick’s protest movement began in 2016 as a way to highlight police killings of unarmed black Americans. Despite pushback from some owners of NFL teams, a number of athletes have followed in Kaepernick’s footsteps this year by kneeling while the U.S. national anthem is being sung before football games. The movement has also found supporters outside the world of professional football ― from a congresswoman on the House floor to the cast of Broadway’s “Miss Saigon.” Simran said that he believes speaking out for black lives is simply the right thing to do. But beyond that, he said that there is also strategic value in forming alliances between black Americans and South Asian communities. This alliance is something the scholar said he hopes to see more of in the future. “Anti-Black racism is ... a worldview fueled by white supremacy that was exported through European colonialism,” he said. “Anti-Black racism permeates South Asian culture as much as any other, and this pernicious bias keeps us from identifying and standing with our Black sisters and brothers to the extent that we really should. It’s a problem South Asians don’t discuss openly or often enough, and it’s a problem we need to address with real urgency.”Because of the history of bigotry that South Asians and Sikhs have faced in the country, Simran said that it is important to work together towards equality.“The first anti-Sikh race riots took place in Bellingham, Washington in 1907, and South Asians and Sikhs have been dealing with bigotry ever since,” he said. “I believe it’s critically important that we address hate at its core, and we can’t do that until we recognize that the plight of racism is a shared plight and that we’re all in this together. ”"

It’s a lifestyle.The royal formerly known as Kate Middleton attended a foundation gala at Kensington Palace on Tuesday wearing a floor-length lace black Diane Von Furstenberg gown that will look awfully familiar to any Kate enthusiast. That’s because it’s the same dress she wore in 2014 to the Royal Variety Performance in London, when she was also pregnant, then with Princess Charlotte. “So what,” you’re thinking. “She repeated an outfit. That’s not news!” But bear with us. It seems that black lace is the duchess’ foolproof special occasion material of choice. Here she is wearing a black lace dress during an event at the Natural History Museum in London in December 2013.Here she is again during a charity gala for SportsAid in November 2013.Oh, look! It’s another little lace black dress from a trip to New York City in December 2014.And here she’s wearing what looks like the shorter version of her DVF gown during the Annual Festival of Remembrance in London in 2015.Lace is a staple in Kate’s wardrobe ― she’s also worn lace dresses in green, beige and pink ― but we think it’s safe to say she has an ultimate favorite.

81,IMPACT,I Called Him Charlie,"Terrance Thomas, ContributorRebel With A Reason",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/i-called-him-charlie_us_59fa307ae4b09afdf01c4005,"I called him Charlie. Charlie was, and still is a stoic man who, despite the Surgeon General’s warning, smokes Swisher Sweet",2017-11-07,<p> Objects in this picture appear further than they are.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a01ecf01d000019007f492e.jpg?ops=crop_0_2_1280_718%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"I called him Charlie. Charlie was, and still is a stoic man who, despite the Surgeon General’s warning, smokes Swisher Sweet cigars religiously and has a fashion sense that can rival any given thrift shop. His walk, though delayed, is nothing short of regal. His low octave voice is smooth as a blues chord progression. That is the one thing I wish I inherited from him. And if you think the other side of the pillow is cool, just wait until you meet Charlie. He’s got the other side beat by at least a few degrees.He is what many would consider a “man’s man”: charming, rugged and great with his hands. I watched him restore an old Cutlass Supreme from a honking pile of metal to a well-oiled machine one summer. He loves vintage vehicles alike. I suppose they remind him of a simpler time. You would like him, I’m sure. Other than that, I couldn’t tell you too much more about him. Those are observations that I’ve gathered in passing. I could tell you that he never used his low octave voice to correct me when I called him by his first name. I never found that strange. “Charlie” seemed fitting for a man that I barely knew.I could tell you that his walk; that smooth and regal walk never quite made its way towards me. Or that Charlie and I don’t share a last name. The hospital must have been out of pens on February 7th, 1990, because there is a blank where my father’s name should be on my birth certificate. I could also tell you that in 27 years we have not expressed a single instance of love or admiration for each other. We did, however, manage to squeeze a brief hug in at my Mother’s funeral. I was 19. That was also the first time I called him “dad”. I think we were both too grief-stricken to even acknowledge the moment. I watched far too many sitcoms growing up that have more than likely distorted my levels of expectation. But I envisioned the first time to be a little less awkward. I could have really used a studio audience “Awwwww”. Or I could just cut to the chase and tell you that after years of compartmentalizing and suppression, I am finally realizing that I resent Charlie for his dilemma with fatherhood.Though my parent’s relationship that haphazardly blossomed into a common law marriage, and ultimately to an official marriage was unconventional, Charlie was never absent in a physical sense. Which is just a really nice way of saying I actually saw him. Whether he saw me or not has always been a thought that has plagued me. I can best describe Charlie’s presence as a translucent fog. I’ve reached into enough fog clouds to know that even the mystic fogs will leave your hand empty and dewy. Word to the wise: don’t go chasing waterfalls or fog clouds either.I was, for all practical purposes, a mama’s boy. I was also mama’s favorite. If my siblings tell you otherwise, I assure you it is heresy at best. Though my mother was the personification of all things great and motherly, I placed a burden of emotional labor on her. I needed her to be everything that Charlie wasn’t. In hindsight, my gravitation to mama’s boyhood was more nurture than nature. I believe she knew that. Perhaps that is why she overcompensated.A few months ago, I received a call from Charlie. We had previously spoken a whopping two times this year. Our phone conversations are always full of awkward interruptions and long spells of silence. We’ve never had a conversation last longer than 5 minutes. But this call was different. I could tell by the tone of his voice that this wasn’t my semi-annual welfare check. Charlie told me that he wanted to build a better relationship with me. It was the call that I have been waiting for my entire life. Johnny Charlie come lately. What sparked his epiphany is beyond me. My guess is that he is realizing that old age and loneliness can force introspection. But that is only my speculation. Now, where was I? Oh, that’s right. The call. That was our last conversation. He has called a few times since then. But I have purposely ignored them until I am able to sort out my feelings of anxiousness and anger.Now that I finally have leverage, I’m not completely convinced that I won’t use this as an opportunity to kamikaze myself for a Pyrrhic victory. There’s a part of me that wants to isolate him so he can feel what I felt. I’m sure any therapist, psychologist, or any-damn-one with a sound mind would advise against that. But there’s another part of me, a practical me who knows that revenge is a temporary anesthetic. And as much as I attempt to convince myself that I am somehow okay, I know I am not. I am many things; I am jaded. I am broken. I am angry. But okay? Never heard of the guy. Because no matter how I old I am, I still feel like that little boy who looks at his father’s shadow and wonders if it will play with him. I’m not sure how this story ends. I have accepted that it may very well be a cautionary tale. But I hope to one day be in a space where I am ready to take Charlie up on his offer. That day is not today, unfortunately.I didn’t need Charlie to be perfect. He didn’t have to be a hero. I would have loved him as he was. I just needed to know that Charlie cared enough to be my father."
82,POLITICS,The U.N. Security Council Needs To Remember Why Chemical Weapons Are Banned,"Louis Charbonneau, ContributorUN director at Human Rights Watch",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/un-security-council-remember-why-chemical-weapons_us_5a02228fe4b02f3ab3377dd4,They should make clear to those contemplating their use that the international community can track them down and prosecute them.,2017-11-07,"<p>A crater is seen at the site of an airstrike, after what rescue workers described as a suspected gas attack in the town of Khan Sheikhoun in rebel-held Idlib, Syria April 4, 2017.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0382271b00003e003763a9.jpeg?cache=FPwzPb4v56&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As members of the U.N. Security Council debate this week about whether to renew their Syria chemical weapons investigation, they might want to read Wilfred Owen’s World War I poem “Dulce Et Decorum Est.” It describes an attack in which a man dies from exposure to a chemical agent on the battlefield, “stumbling and flound’ring like a man in fire”:“If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood / Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs.”Owen’s gut-wrenching scene from a century ago is worth revisiting, because the scene he so vividly depicted has been repeated over and over again in Syria for at least four years. Many of the victims have been civilians, including children. They have died from exposure to sarin, sulfur mustard and chlorine.The horrors of chemical attacks in WWI and the 1980s Iran-Iraq war are among the reasons countries have, since the 1920s, sought to end them. This culminated when the vast majority of countries came together and agreed to create the Chemical Weapons Convention, the global ban on these hideous weapons that came into force in 1997.In the wake of the August 2013 sarin attack on two Damascus suburbs that left hundreds of civilians dead, Russia and the United States set aside their differences and required Syria to dismantle its chemical stockpile and join the treaty. The Security Council unanimously endorsed the U.S.-Russian plan, which brought Syria into the world’s most adhered-to weapons ban.While the Syrian government handed over much of its chemical weapons stock for destruction, it did not stop using these weapons, as documented by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which is in charge of ensuring that the treaty is observed.Security Council members need to restore the lost consensus that followed the terrible August 2013 attacks and renew the mandate of the Joint Investigative Mechanism, a team of investigators staffed by the U.N. and Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Its job is to identify those responsible for chemical attacks in Syria that have continued since Syria joined the chemical weapons treaty so they can be held to account for their crimes.Last month, Russia vetoed a proposed renewal of the Joint Investigative Mechanism due to a dispute over whether the renewal vote would be held before its report was released on whether the Syrian government was responsible for an attack earlier this year. The JIM has confirmed that the Syrian government was responsible for that attack, a sarin attack at Khan Sheikhoun in April. But in the same report, it also confirmed that ISIS was responsible for a sulfur mustard attack in 2016. The group is investigating other attacks where the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has confirmed the presence of chemical agents.It’s not too late to renew the Joint Investigative Mechanism before its mandate expires this month. Disliking its conclusions is no reason to shut it down. The security council and its members have an obligation to let it continue with its work and then to impose sanctions on individuals and entities responsible for the chemical attacks.The United Nations Security Council should make clear to those contemplating the use of chemical weapons that the international community can track them down and prosecute them. Shuttering the JIM would send a message to combatants in Syria and elsewhere that getting away with chemical murder is easy. It would also send a terrible message that the security council is unwilling to enforce one of the world’s clearest norms prohibiting a method of warfare. Does the security council really want that on its conscience?"

The former made her life miserable through a protracted, mean-spirited grab for her father’s house in Bombay, and the latter ignored her as an embarrassment who dared to marry a non-Muslim in defiance of her father’s wishes. She was further isolated because ― unlike other Indian and Pakistani leaders, whose offspring have gone on to take part in affairs of the nation as prime ministers, senators and ambassadors (for example, M.K. Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Z.A. Bhutto) ― Jinnah’s daughter Dina chose to stay out of politics and the limelight.As I set out in the 1990s to complete the Jinnah Quartet, consisting of two films and two books on Jinnah, I knew I had to interview Jinnah’s only child in order to confirm some facts of Jinnah’s life and obtain a sense of the man through the daughter. Thanks to some friends and Dina’s son Nusli, a thorough gentleman, I was fortunate to have had several telephonic conversations and meetings with Dina in the late 1990s in New York and succeeded in getting her to agree to be interviewed for the documentary film “Mr. Jinnah ― the Making of Pakistan.”In this article, I will share her own words on a number of topics from quotes and passages which are excerpted from the documentary and the book Jinnah, Pakistan and Islamic Identity ― The Search for Saladin. Those interested will find the film online and the book published by Oxford University Press.Meeting DinaI found Dina at first somewhat brusque in manner, cold and distant, but she warmed up as our conversations continued and by the end I found her charming, intelligent, sharp and affable. She was overjoyed to receive the beautiful Swati embroidered shawl and shalwar kameez set my wife had sent for her and asked me to thank her several times.She had agreed to come out for tea with me to a restaurant that she had chosen. As the two of us talked, I felt profoundly humbled and honored to be with her and to be able to glimpse her father who I admired so much. In her style of speaking and mannerism, assertive and clipped, sharp features, light complexion and fastidious dressing she bore a striking resemblance to her father. My sense was of a naturally shy person who valued her privacy and deliberately kept away from India-Pakistan issues. She avoided the media like the plague.Dina on her father[On Jinnah growing up]: “He grew up and, it would be 16, then he wanted to go to England. He came from a very well-off family and they were merchants and he didn’t want for anything. His father decided it perhaps he should send his son to England for further education. He wanted to go but his mother was not very happy. She was very upset.”[On Jinnah being asked by his father to come home and support the foundering family business]: “And he said no, he didn’t want to go back. He wanted to finish everything and finish his education and so on. And he did.”[On Jinnah and the relationship with Gandhi]: “When Gandhi came from South Africa, my father was already an established politician. I think the original thing that was in common was how to get the British out ― you know, how to get India independent.”[On Jinnah’s religiosity]: “He was not a religious man, but he wasn’t irreligious either. There was no big religious thing.”[On Jinnah and his view of the two communities]: “If Muslims got 10 rupees they would buy a pretty scarf and eat a biriani whereas Hindus would save the money.”[On life in London]: She recalled that in the early 1930s Jinnah lived in a large house in Hampstead, London, had an English chauffeur who drove his Bentley and an English staff to serve him. There were two cooks, Indian and Irish, and Jinnah’s favorite food was curry and rice. He enjoyed playing billiards. She remembers her father taking her to the theatre, pantomimes and circuses.[On Jinnah’s reaction to her marriage to a non-Muslim]: “He wasn’t too happy because I think it was that crucial time all around. He was very disapproving, and we didn’t speak for a few years.”[On attempted assassination on Jinnah]: “He fought off the man. What happened was that this man came with a knife, and my father was struggling with him, and so the knife cut him. His chauffeur, his driver was in the driveway in a van, and he was a big Pathan, and he just cut him off.”[On Jinnah’s decision to split from India]: “He never really wanted to break away. He thought everybody could live together and come to terms with the Congress party or the Hindu government or whoever was going to be in charge. And, as history tells us, it wasn’t to be.”[On learning about the creation of Pakistan]: “I was in Bombay at my house, and he phoned and he said, ‘We’ve got it.’ I said, ‘Got what?’ and he said ‘Pakistan.’ I said, ‘Well you’ve worked hard for it.’ And then we had a personal conversation and that was it… I never saw him again because he was in Pakistan.”[On Jinnah’s funeral – Dina’s first visit to Pakistan]: “Oh, it was massive. I’ve never heard so many people cry ― I mean most, but in the mourning and crying and flowers, there were thousands and thousands lakhs of people, but that was to be expected. Remember that Pakistan had only been going for a year or something, so it was very emotional.”[On relations with her father]: Father and daughter had fallen out when Dina announced that she planned to marry Neville Wadia, a Christian who had once been a Parsee. At the time, Jinnah had just become the leader of the Muslims of India and was therefore highly conscious of his role. In an angry exchange between father and daughter, Jinnah told her that there were millions of Muslim boys in India, and she could have anyone she chose. She replied that there were millions of Muslim girls and he could have married one of them, so why did he marry her mother? Inevitably there was a break in relations. Dina married Neville Wadia in 1938 and they had a daughter and son, but the couple separated a few years after partition.Jinnah’s relationship with his daughter is widely misunderstood. He is depicted as a cold and unfeeling father who ordered his daughter out of his house because she married against his will and he never spoke to his daughter after she married. This information is incorrect. Dina confirmed to me that when she heard her father had almost been assassinated in 1943 she telephoned to ask if he was safe and said she would like to see him. “Of course,” he replied. Immediately she rushed over to his house.There is written evidence of the affection between Dina and her father in the last years of Jinnah’s life. A letter uncovered a few decades ago sent by Dina from Bombay to her father on hearing the news about Pakistan on 28 April 1947 reads:My darling Papa, First of all I must congratulate you ― we have got Pakistan … how hard you have worked for it … I do hope you are keeping well ― I get lots of news of you from the newspapers. The children are just recovering from their whooping cough, it will take another month yet. I am taking them to Juhu on Thursday for a month or so. Are you coming back here? If so I hope you will drive out to Juhu and spend the day if you like. Anyway I have a phone so I will ring you up and drive in to see you if you don’t feel like coming out. Take care of yourself Papa darling. Lots of love & kisses, DinaShe wrote another letter early in June 1947 from Juhu, Bombay, after hearing of the announcement of the date for Pakistan:Papa darling, At this minute you must be with the Viceroy. I must say that it is wonderful what you have achieved in these last few years and I feel so proud and happy for you. You have been the only man in India of late who has been a realist and a[n] honest and brilliant tactician ― this letter is beginning to sound like fan-mail, isn’t it?The letter had begun, “It was really so sweet of you to write as I know how very busy you are,” and ended: “Take care of yourself. Lots of love and kisses and [a] big hug.” It is a typical letter from a daughter to her father and there is no hint of estrangement in it.In conversation, Dina recalled her father with warm affection, describing him as a “sweet man.” Of course he was austere, she said, like many other men born in the Victorian era, but mentioned the happy days in London. She remembers sitting at the edge of his bed in the morning having tea while he read the papers, and recalls him as always having time for her. He often quoted Shakespeare to her and his favorite lines were from Hamlet:“This above all: To thine own self be true, / And it must follow, As the night the day, / Thou canst not then be false to any man.”She dismissed the characterization of her father as cold, remarking that he would put his hand on people’s shoulders while he was talking with them. He would interrupt his file work to speak to her, to explain things to her. When I told her that Mountbatten had called her father a psychopath, she replied with spirit: “Mountbatten was the psychopath.”But in the last years Jinnah was very sick and in any case he was reserved and brought up to be restrained and reticent.Dina did not agree with the way in which her father was portrayed in the film Gandhi, although she enjoyed the film. Dina saw it again in 1995, when, in the light of our meeting, she watched it carefully. She noted that her father appeared “shifty-eyed” and “furtive”; even his clothes were shabby, his collars too big. In reality her father was a “dandy,” she said, “meticulous” in his dress. Besides, he had started wearing the sherwani and the film shows Jinnah always in a Western suit[On Partition]: The partition of India split Dina from her father. It was a sword hanging over every Muslim home. Jinnah’s was no exception. His one child Dina had to make a choice. She had either to accompany her father to Karachi and the new homeland he had created or to stay with her husband in Bombay. She chose to remain with her husband and children. She would not see her father again; he would be dead within a year.The partition of father and daughter may have been overshadowed by the larger partition of India but in its personal tragedy it creates a powerful metaphor. It was made more poignant by the fact that the date of partition ― midnight on 14-15 August ― was her birthday. In her flat in Bombay she had put out two flags, Indian and Pakistani, symbolizing her dilemma. Dina’s predicament must have weighed heavily on Jinnah and added to his sorrows as he saw the havoc caused by partition.On her mother“She was young, beautiful, very very intelligent, very bright. Loved beautiful things, and she was a humorous, fun person. They had the same sort of interests, like in politics and things like that, and he was already at a pinnacle in a way. So that was very glamorous. They fell in love, and my grandfather was absolutely appalled, first because of the age difference. I think he was 39 and she was 16 and she came from a prominent Parsi family, and he wasn’t too anxious that she should marry out of her community. My father was a Muslim; distinguished or not it didn’t seem to matter. The moment she was 18, that was it. She walked out and married him.”Additionally, Dina remembers her “warm, intelligent, wonderful” mother thusly: “She was humorous and loved poetry and the arts.” According to Dina, Lady Petit, her grandmother, “adored” Jinnah.[On Jinnah’s relationship with her mother]: “Well what happened is that he was a very very busy man. He had all his cases, he had a living to make. And then he had politics. And he had, you know, a young, beautiful girl, but he wasn’t able to give her the time that she should have had … Then she fell ill, she fell very ill. And that was very difficult. She died of colitis. But very bad colitis. I believe there are several types, and I think she had one of the worst. She was very very very sick. I used to visit her when she was ill, in any case.”[On Jinnah’s reaction after her mother’s death]: Ruttie’s death “devastated” Jinnah, according to Dina. “He would never be the same again; something died in him.” “A curtain fell over him,” said Dina, remembering her childhood. “I think he withdrew a lot. Not in his work, in his politics, but I think he became even more dedicated to his work then.”On PakistanisDina expressed her irritation about Pakistanis who only seemed to be interested in whether her father ate ham and drank whisky. To put the matter to rest, I asked Dina whether the story about her mother offering her father ham sandwiches in the middle of a political campaign had any factual basis. She recalled that over sixty years ago they were traveling by train to a hill station when ham sandwiches were brought with the food as part of the menu. Her father had them sent away.The savage scale of the killing of refugees on both sides shook Jinnah to the core, hastening his end. This is precisely how Dina saw her father’s death. She believed that he literally sacrificed himself for his new nation. Her bitterness towards Pakistanis is explained by the nation’s failure to recognize his supreme sacrifice and live up to his ideals.On Gandhi  Dina confirmed that there was little “personal animosity” between her father and Gandhi, only “political animosity.” Gandhi was “charming,” “sweet,” “enchanting,” and had a “sense of humour” as well as an eye for pretty girls, she said chuckling, recalling she was young and pretty when she first met him.She kept abreast of affairs in South Asia. “They don’t respect Gandhi in India, so why should they respect my father in Pakistan. No man is a prophet in his own country.” She also observed that there was a lot of what she termed “sick thinking” in the subcontinent, that it was going in the “wrong way towards fundamentalism,” and like “global warming,” there was “global fundamentalism.”During her 2004 visit, she wrote of her father in the visitors’ book at the Quaid-e-Azam Mausoleum in Karachi, “This has been very sad and wonderful for me. May his dream for Pakistan come true.” That statement revealed her feelings for both her father and the nation he created.When she died in November 2017, the world media was using the freeze-frame picture of hers from “Mr. Jinnah ― the Making of Pakistan.” It showed a confident, dignified and impressive person. My tribute had not been in vain."

As the two of us talked, I felt profoundly humbled and honored to be with her and to be able to glimpse her father who I admired so much. In her style of speaking and mannerism, assertive and clipped, sharp features, light complexion and fastidious dressing she bore a striking resemblance to her father. My sense was of a naturally shy person who valued her privacy and deliberately kept away from India-Pakistan issues. She avoided the media like the plague.Dina on her father[On Jinnah growing up]: “He grew up and, it would be 16, then he wanted to go to England. He came from a very well-off family and they were merchants and he didn’t want for anything. His father decided it perhaps he should send his son to England for further education. He wanted to go but his mother was not very happy. She was very upset.”[On Jinnah being asked by his father to come home and support the foundering family business]: “And he said no, he didn’t want to go back. He wanted to finish everything and finish his education and so on. And he did.”[On Jinnah and the relationship with Gandhi]: “When Gandhi came from South Africa, my father was already an established politician. I think the original thing that was in common was how to get the British out ― you know, how to get India independent.”[On Jinnah’s religiosity]: “He was not a religious man, but he wasn’t irreligious either. There was no big religious thing.”[On Jinnah and his view of the two communities]: “If Muslims got 10 rupees they would buy a pretty scarf and eat a biriani whereas Hindus would save the money.”[On life in London]: She recalled that in the early 1930s Jinnah lived in a large house in Hampstead, London, had an English chauffeur who drove his Bentley and an English staff to serve him. There were two cooks, Indian and Irish, and Jinnah’s favorite food was curry and rice. He enjoyed playing billiards. She remembers her father taking her to the theatre, pantomimes and circuses.[On Jinnah’s reaction to her marriage to a non-Muslim]: “He wasn’t too happy because I think it was that crucial time all around. He was very disapproving, and we didn’t speak for a few years.”[On attempted assassination on Jinnah]: “He fought off the man. What happened was that this man came with a knife, and my father was struggling with him, and so the knife cut him. His chauffeur, his driver was in the driveway in a van, and he was a big Pathan, and he just cut him off.”[On Jinnah’s decision to split from India]: “He never really wanted to break away. He thought everybody could live together and come to terms with the Congress party or the Hindu government or whoever was going to be in charge. And, as history tells us, it wasn’t to be.”[On learning about the creation of Pakistan]: “I was in Bombay at my house, and he phoned and he said, ‘We’ve got it.’ I said, ‘Got what?’ and he said ‘Pakistan.’ I said, ‘Well you’ve worked hard for it.’ And then we had a personal conversation and that was it… I never saw him again because he was in Pakistan.”[On Jinnah’s funeral – Dina’s first visit to Pakistan]: “Oh, it was massive. I’ve never heard so many people cry ― I mean most, but in the mourning and crying and flowers, there were thousands and thousands lakhs of people, but that was to be expected. Remember that Pakistan had only been going for a year or something, so it was very emotional.”[On relations with her father]: Father and daughter had fallen out when Dina announced that she planned to marry Neville Wadia, a Christian who had once been a Parsee. At the time, Jinnah had just become the leader of the Muslims of India and was therefore highly conscious of his role. In an angry exchange between father and daughter, Jinnah told her that there were millions of Muslim boys in India, and she could have anyone she chose. She replied that there were millions of Muslim girls and he could have married one of them, so why did he marry her mother? Inevitably there was a break in relations. Dina married Neville Wadia in 1938 and they had a daughter and son, but the couple separated a few years after partition.Jinnah’s relationship with his daughter is widely misunderstood. He is depicted as a cold and unfeeling father who ordered his daughter out of his house because she married against his will and he never spoke to his daughter after she married. This information is incorrect. Dina confirmed to me that when she heard her father had almost been assassinated in 1943 she telephoned to ask if he was safe and said she would like to see him. “Of course,” he replied. Immediately she rushed over to his house.There is written evidence of the affection between Dina and her father in the last years of Jinnah’s life. A letter uncovered a few decades ago sent by Dina from Bombay to her father on hearing the news about Pakistan on 28 April 1947 reads:My darling Papa, First of all I must congratulate you ― we have got Pakistan … how hard you have worked for it … I do hope you are keeping well ― I get lots of news of you from the newspapers. The children are just recovering from their whooping cough, it will take another month yet. I am taking them to Juhu on Thursday for a month or so. Are you coming back here? If so I hope you will drive out to Juhu and spend the day if you like. Anyway I have a phone so I will ring you up and drive in to see you if you don’t feel like coming out. Take care of yourself Papa darling. Lots of love & kisses, DinaShe wrote another letter early in June 1947 from Juhu, Bombay, after hearing of the announcement of the date for Pakistan:Papa darling, At this minute you must be with the Viceroy. I must say that it is wonderful what you have achieved in these last few years and I feel so proud and happy for you. You have been the only man in India of late who has been a realist and a[n] honest and brilliant tactician ― this letter is beginning to sound like fan-mail, isn’t it?The letter had begun, “It was really so sweet of you to write as I know how very busy you are,” and ended: “Take care of yourself. Lots of love and kisses and [a] big hug.” It is a typical letter from a daughter to her father and there is no hint of estrangement in it.In conversation, Dina recalled her father with warm affection, describing him as a “sweet man.” Of course he was austere, she said, like many other men born in the Victorian era, but mentioned the happy days in London. She remembers sitting at the edge of his bed in the morning having tea while he read the papers, and recalls him as always having time for her. He often quoted Shakespeare to her and his favorite lines were from Hamlet:“This above all: To thine own self be true, / And it must follow, As the night the day, / Thou canst not then be false to any man.”She dismissed the characterization of her father as cold, remarking that he would put his hand on people’s shoulders while he was talking with them. He would interrupt his file work to speak to her, to explain things to her. When I told her that Mountbatten had called her father a psychopath, she replied with spirit: “Mountbatten was the psychopath.”But in the last years Jinnah was very sick and in any case he was reserved and brought up to be restrained and reticent.Dina did not agree with the way in which her father was portrayed in the film Gandhi, although she enjoyed the film. Dina saw it again in 1995, when, in the light of our meeting, she watched it carefully. She noted that her father appeared “shifty-eyed” and “furtive”; even his clothes were shabby, his collars too big. In reality her father was a “dandy,” she said, “meticulous” in his dress. Besides, he had started wearing the sherwani and the film shows Jinnah always in a Western suit[On Partition]: The partition of India split Dina from her father. It was a sword hanging over every Muslim home. Jinnah’s was no exception. His one child Dina had to make a choice. She had either to accompany her father to Karachi and the new homeland he had created or to stay with her husband in Bombay. She chose to remain with her husband and children. She would not see her father again; he would be dead within a year.The partition of father and daughter may have been overshadowed by the larger partition of India but in its personal tragedy it creates a powerful metaphor. It was made more poignant by the fact that the date of partition ― midnight on 14-15 August ― was her birthday. In her flat in Bombay she had put out two flags, Indian and Pakistani, symbolizing her dilemma. Dina’s predicament must have weighed heavily on Jinnah and added to his sorrows as he saw the havoc caused by partition.On her mother“She was young, beautiful, very very intelligent, very bright. Loved beautiful things, and she was a humorous, fun person. They had the same sort of interests, like in politics and things like that, and he was already at a pinnacle in a way. So that was very glamorous. They fell in love, and my grandfather was absolutely appalled, first because of the age difference. I think he was 39 and she was 16 and she came from a prominent Parsi family, and he wasn’t too anxious that she should marry out of her community. My father was a Muslim; distinguished or not it didn’t seem to matter. The moment she was 18, that was it. She walked out and married him.”Additionally, Dina remembers her “warm, intelligent, wonderful” mother thusly: “She was humorous and loved poetry and the arts.” According to Dina, Lady Petit, her grandmother, “adored” Jinnah.[On Jinnah’s relationship with her mother]: “Well what happened is that he was a very very busy man. He had all his cases, he had a living to make. And then he had politics. And he had, you know, a young, beautiful girl, but he wasn’t able to give her the time that she should have had … Then she fell ill, she fell very ill. And that was very difficult. She died of colitis. But very bad colitis. I believe there are several types, and I think she had one of the worst. She was very very very sick. I used to visit her when she was ill, in any case.”[On Jinnah’s reaction after her mother’s death]: Ruttie’s death “devastated” Jinnah, according to Dina. “He would never be the same again; something died in him.” “A curtain fell over him,” said Dina, remembering her childhood. “I think he withdrew a lot. Not in his work, in his politics, but I think he became even more dedicated to his work then.”On PakistanisDina expressed her irritation about Pakistanis who only seemed to be interested in whether her father ate ham and drank whisky. To put the matter to rest, I asked Dina whether the story about her mother offering her father ham sandwiches in the middle of a political campaign had any factual basis. She recalled that over sixty years ago they were traveling by train to a hill station when ham sandwiches were brought with the food as part of the menu. Her father had them sent away.The savage scale of the killing of refugees on both sides shook Jinnah to the core, hastening his end. This is precisely how Dina saw her father’s death. She believed that he literally sacrificed himself for his new nation. Her bitterness towards Pakistanis is explained by the nation’s failure to recognize his supreme sacrifice and live up to his ideals.On Gandhi  Dina confirmed that there was little “personal animosity” between her father and Gandhi, only “political animosity.” Gandhi was “charming,” “sweet,” “enchanting,” and had a “sense of humour” as well as an eye for pretty girls, she said chuckling, recalling she was young and pretty when she first met him.She kept abreast of affairs in South Asia. “They don’t respect Gandhi in India, so why should they respect my father in Pakistan. No man is a prophet in his own country.” She also observed that there was a lot of what she termed “sick thinking” in the subcontinent, that it was going in the “wrong way towards fundamentalism,” and like “global warming,” there was “global fundamentalism.”During her 2004 visit, she wrote of her father in the visitors’ book at the Quaid-e-Azam Mausoleum in Karachi, “This has been very sad and wonderful for me. May his dream for Pakistan come true.” That statement revealed her feelings for both her father and the nation he created.When she died in November 2017, the world media was using the freeze-frame picture of hers from “Mr. Jinnah ― the Making of Pakistan.” It showed a confident, dignified and impressive person. My tribute had not been in vain."
