0,POLITICS,Bernie Sanders’ Economic Inequality Town Hall Draws 1.7 Million Live Viewers,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-economic-inequality-town-hall-million-viewers_us_5ab08fb6e4b0e862383ab6b4,The Vermont senator is using his reach to try to shape a national progressive narrative.,2018-03-20,"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) speaks at the South by Southwest (SXSW) conference in Austin, Texas, on March 9.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab091462000002d00eb2639.jpeg?cache=ME0adP5Mu9&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Sen. Bernie Sanders’ televised town hall on economic inequality drew about 1.7 million live viewers during an online broadcast Monday night.The panel-discussion-style event, called “Inequality in America: The Rise of Oligarchy and Collapse of the Middle Class,” exceeded the viewership of Sanders’ first live town hall on single-payer health care in January.The broadcast provided the Vermont independent with an opportunity to expand his new alternative media revue beyond “Medicare for all” to the broader issue of economic inequality, which he maintains that commercial media outlets frequently ignore.“What I would say to our friends in the corporate media: Start paying attention to the reality of how many people in our country are struggling economically every single day ― and talk about it,” Sanders declared at one point during the discussion.Not content to wait for the cable television channels and newspapers to take him up on his advice, Sanders partnered with The Guardian, The Young Turks, NowThis and Act.tv to do just that for about an hour and a half on Monday night.Three co-hosts aided Sanders in his efforts: Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), New School economist Darrick Hamilton and filmmaker Michael Moore.Together they interviewed three guests with specialized knowledge of the economic and political structures suppressing economic mobility and funneling wealth upward. Catherine Coleman Flowers, a founder of the anti-poverty Alabama Center for Rural Enterprise Community Development Corp., spoke about the destitute poverty of the rural black community in Lowndes County, Alabama, where exposure to untreated sewage prompted a rare outbreak of hookworm. Cindy Estrada, a vice president of the United Auto Workers, addressed the role of organized labor in raising living standards ― and how its decline has lowered them. And Gordon Lafer, a political scientist from the University of Oregon, explained how corporate interests neutralized public opposition through campaign donations and massive lobbying efforts.An audience of about 450 people attended the town hall in person in the U.S. Capitol auditorium. An additional 100 people viewed the event on monitors in an overflow room. The rest of what Sanders’ staff estimates were 1.7 million live viewers saw the event online. (HuffPost’s back-of-the-envelope tally from the social media pages of Sanders, Warren and the various digital partners produced a similar figure.)Billed as a seminar on the causes of, and solutions to, rising income and wealth inequality, the town hall often doubled as a progressive pep rally for social democratic reforms.During Estrada’s appearance, for example, Warren’s homage to labor unions elicited thunderous applause. “Unions built America’s middle class. It’ll take unions to rebuild America’s middle class,” she said.For his part, Moore focused on the failure of the Democratic Party, which fashions itself as the party of working people, to stand true to its mission. This line of inquiry took Moore first into a discussion of the ostensibly Democratic leanings of the three wealthiest men in the country ― Warren Buffett, Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos ― and later into a riff on the Democrats who voted to authorize the Iraq War exactly 15 years earlier.Moore appeared to be saying that letting Democrats off the hook had contributed to the collapse of the middle class.“It’s so important that we hold the people who say they’re for the people ― hold their feet to the fire! And if they’re not going to do the job they say they’re going to do, let’s get somebody else,” he concluded to loud ovation.The origins of American inequality that Sanders and his allies sketched on Monday are by now familiar to left-leaning activists immersed in the works of Robert Reich and Jacob Hacker, among other progressive thinkers.In this history, former President Ronald Reagan ushered in a new era of corporate domination with his symbolic decision to fire striking air traffic controllers in August 1981. The move was the opening salvo in a prolonged war against organized labor that steadily diminished unions’ ranks and reduced their clout, according to numerous liberal scholars.A host of tax breaks, deregulatory measures, corporate-skewed trade agreements and safety net reductions backed by members of both parties in subsequent decades served to heighten the inequality generated in the 1980s. The result, Sanders said in his introductory remarks, is a country where “the top 10th of 1 percent owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent.“In recent years, we have seen incredible growth in the number of billionaires, while 40 million Americans continue to live in poverty and we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on Earth,” he continued. A prominent feature of the evening’s analysis that Sanders’ critics have sometimes accused him of downplaying was an explicit breakdown of the racial roots of American poverty.Flowers, who invited the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Extreme Poverty to witness the squalid conditions in Lowndes County, argued that state authorities have failed to address the issue of inadequate sewage systems because of entrenched racist views.“Some of those same types of attitudes that existed prior to the 1960s, the structural racism that was reinforced by racial terror, is still in existence today,” Flowers said.Hamilton suggested that the universal programs Sanders favors would not erase the racial inequities that follow black Americans at every level of socioeconomic and educational attainment. He noted that a black household headed by a college graduate has, on average, less wealth than a white household headed by a high school dropout.“So when Sen. Sanders proposes that we should have tuition-free public education ― absolutely, but as an end unto itself. We exaggerate the returns from education, particularly to marginalized groups,” Hamilton said.Sanders, Warren and Moore all endorsed relatively well-known left-leaning solutions to inequality, including a $15 minimum wage, stronger unions, free college education and paid family leave policies.Perhaps in keeping with his intersectional focus, Hamilton embraced more radical measures. His preferred solutions included the creation of trust funds for every American at birth, a federal job guarantee, the replacement of private payday lenders with postal banking and an end to academic tracking in grade school, which he argued often replicates racial segregation, even within relatively integrated schools.“To really get beyond our race problem, when we’re ready as a nation to come together, we need to come to grips with reparations,” Hamilton concluded, prompting cheers from the crowd.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly quoted Sanders as stating that the top tenth of 1 percent of earners own almost as much wealth as the bottom 99 percent. In fact, he said the bottom 90 percent."

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said on CNN Tuesday.Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), who signed a bipartisan letter with Klobuchar seeking a judiciary hearing with Zuckerberg and other media CEOs, expressed particular concern with the social media site’s handling of user data. Reports this week say Cambridge Analytica, hired by Trump’s presidential campaign, improperly collected personal data of millions of Facebook users without their knowledge.Facebook’s “behavior lately has been kind of getting into the foothills of creepy,” Kennedy said on CNN.“My interests are larger than Cambridge Analytica. I want to know what extent if any those of us on Facebook live in a contrived universe, created by Facebook, kind of like Truman on the ‘Truman Show,’” Kennedy said, referencing the 1998 movie about a man who unknowingly lives in a scripted world.Facebook officials reportedly tentatively agreed to brief the House Judiciary Committee as early as Wednesday, Bloomberg News reported Tuesday, citing an unidentified congressional official described as familiar with the discussions. It hadn’t been finalized whether Zuckerberg or someone else would represent the company.A statement attributed to a Facebook spokesperson on Tuesday said the company’s executives and staff are “outraged we were deceived.” This follows the company’s claim that a third party supplied users’ information to Cambridge Analytica in a way that violated Facebook policy. “We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information and will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,” the statement obtained by Newsweek reads.Facebook is conducting an internal and external review to verify if the data Cambridge Analytica obtained has been deleted as the company has previously stated, said Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice president and deputy general counsel, in a statement to HuffPost.“That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” Grewal added.Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) also have sent letters to Zuckerberg or have spoken publicly of the need for him to testify before Congress.The Federal Trade Commission is reportedly investigating whether Facebook violated terms of a 2011 consent decree in its handling of users’ data, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, citing an anonymous person familiar with the matter.That decree required Facebook to obtain consent from users before making certain changes to privacy settings. A violation could result in millions of dollars of fines, a former FTC official told The Washington Post.European authorities are similarly concerned. U.K. Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said she is pursuing a warrant to search Cambridge Analytica’s servers after the firm missed a deadline to voluntarily cooperate.“We need to get in to find out on behalf of the public what has happened to this data,” Denham told the BBC. “Because Cambridge Analytica operates in the U.K. they are subject to U.K. data protection law, and we oversee that law so we need to take action.”The U.K.’s Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee on Tuesday sent Zuckerberg a letter requesting him to appear to answer questions about how Facebook and other social media companies acquire and retain user data.The letter, signed by Parliament Member Damian Collins, accused Zuckerberg and other Facebook executives of misleading the committee perviously, and of understating the risk of users’ data being used without their consent.“It is now time to hear from a senior Facebook executive with the sufficient authority to give an accurate account of this catastrophic failure of process,” Collins’ letter reads.Collins later said on Twitter that former Facebook operations manager Sandy Parakilas will answer questions with his committee on Wednesday.Parakilas, who worked for Facebook in 2011 and 2012, has previously expressed concern about the company’s handling of users’ data, telling The Guardian this week, “We had no idea what developers were doing with the data.”This article has been updated to include a response from Facebook and note a report that Facebook had tentatively agreed to meet with the House Judiciary Committee."

At the top of the list, he said, was doing away with policies that have prevented women from flourishing since Saudis imposed strict religious rule in 1979.“We were living a very normal life like the rest of the Gulf countries,” bin Salman said of the pre-1979 period. “Women were driving cars. There were movie theaters in Saudi Arabia. Women worked everywhere.”He called the years since a “painful period that we cannot justify.”Starting in June, women will legally be allowed to drive in Saudi Arabia. Women can now watch sports games and go to the movies, join the military and are no longer required to wear a black abaya ― the robe that covers a woman’s body from head to toe ― in public. The government is working on an equal pay initiative, he added. Interviewer Norah O’Donnell pressed bin Salman on rights women are still denied, including the country’s guardianship laws that require women to ask permission from a male guardian to do things like apply for a passport or get married. Women also can’t eat in restaurants except in a designated family section or receive equal rights in court.He acknowledged there’s more to be done. “Today, Saudi women still have not received their full rights,” he said. “There are rights stipulated in Islam that they still don’t have. We have come a very long way and have a short way to go.”Bin Salman is on a tour of Western countries to promote his country and court investors. After visiting the U.K. last week, he will spend two weeks meeting political and business heads in Washington, New York and Silicon Valley."
6,POLITICS,Pentagon To Senate: We Can't Know If U.S. Fuel Helps Saudi Arabia Kill Civilians In Yemen,Akbar Shahid Ahmed,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pentagon-to-senate-we-cant-know-if-us-fuel-is-helping-saudi-arabia-kill-civilians-in-yemen_us_5aafb207e4b05b221800ab53,A private Defense Department document shared with HuffPost absolves the U.S. of responsibility for airstrikes the U.N. says have killed thousands.,2018-03-19,"A protest sign outside a funeral hall in Sanaa, Yemen, that was hit by the Saudi-led coalition that receives U.S. support.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aafeeef1f0000150316ad32.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The Trump administration is doubling down on its claim that it cannot know whether U.S. support for a Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen enables the bombing of civilians, according to a Pentagon document sent to select Senate offices last week and shared with HuffPost.The Defense Department gave two reasons for not having that information. It said it does not know whether the Saudi and United Arab Emirates planes that receive American aerial refueling are headed for bombing runs or reconnaissance missions, and it cannot investigate the impact of Saudi-UAE airstrikes since Yemen is a conflict zone. But in the same document, the Pentagon maintains that it believes the Saudi-led coalition has become better at preventing civilian casualties ― offering no evidence of how the U.S. can know that.The two-pager represents a previously unreported part of the Pentagon effort to solidify opposition to a Senate resolution that aims to end U.S. assistance to the coalition because Congress never authorized it when then-President Barack Obama initiated the aid in 2015.A vote on the measure, sponsored by Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), is expected later this week.The Pentagon document, sent on March 15, fleshes out testimony that Gen. Joseph Votel, the top U.S. commander in the Middle East, gave on March 13 to the Senate Armed Services Committee. In sometimes heated exchanges with several lawmakers, Votel said the U.S. should continue its support for the coalition even if it cannot tell whether American fuel or bombs are used in airstrikes that kill civilians.Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) asked if the U.S. was maintaining “some level of control” over the coalition’s actions.“The influence that we derive with them is by working with them,” Votel said, adding that he believes the Saudis are adopting American-style procedures to limit civilian casualties.“It’s better for us to stay engaged with them and continue to influence this,” he said.King retorted: “You said for us. How about for the people of Yemen?”U.S. support for the coalition is the best way for the U.S. to look out for Yemenis, Votel responded.Already the poorest country in the Persian Gulf, Yemen has suffered as a years-long fight has been waged between the Saudi-led coalition and Iran-backed rebels with their own track record of targeting civilians and shooting missiles at civilian centers in Saudi Arabia. The coalition has caused two-thirds of the thousands of civilian deaths in Yemen since 2015, according to the United Nations. And a U.N. report in January said the Saudis’ mechanism for investigating airstrikes repeatedly missed incidents U.N. experts verified. Meanwhile, American defense contractors are seeking approval to sell more bombs to Saudi Arabia and the UAE.On Sunday, after the Wall Street Journal published a report from inside the Saudi war room, Obama-era foreign aid official Jeremy Konyndyk tweeted, “Let’s be super clear: the Saudi military has made no serious effort to limit civilian casualties in Yemen.”The likely Senate vote on the American role in the war coincides with a Washington visit by Saudi Crown Prince Muhammed bin Salman ― one of President Donald Trump’s favorite world leaders, and the architect of the Yemen campaign in his role as Saudi defense minister.Trump and the prince are to meet on Tuesday. In a call previewing the session with reporters on Monday afternoon, two senior administration officials said Yemen would be discussed, but stressed the need to thwart Iranian intervention there.The officials did not mention any major shift in U.S. policy, calling the American support for the Saudi-UAE coalition “very modest” and noting U.S. and Saudi humanitarian assistance for victims of the war.The importance of the U.S.-Saudi relationship has become a prominent part of the Trump administration’s case for continuing to aid the coalition.“Saudi Arabia is a strong partner in the Middle East and provides support to U.S. counterterrorism operations against ISIS in Syria and against [Al Qaeda] and ISIS in Yemen,” the document provided to HuffPost reads. It warns that pulling American assistance in Yemen could result in the Saudis doing less to target terror groups. Peace groups slam the Pentagon’s narrative. In a response to Defense Department document, the Friends Committee on National Legislation, Win Without War and the Yemen Peace Project say the administration is trying to weaken congressional oversight.They also say that public American pressure on the Saudi-led coalition has had a greater impact on alleviating the humanitarian crisis in Yemen than behind-the-scene efforts by U.S. officials. And the groups note that the Senate resolution does not prevent the U.S. from continuing to help defend the Saudis and other partners from attacks emanating from within Yemen. “Continuing unconditional U.S. military support does nothing to support the push for a negotiated resolution [in Yemen], instead endorsing more stalemated military operations,” the groups argue. “Ending essential U.S. military support will change the coalition’s cost-benefit analysis of continuing this intervention indefinitely.”This story has been updated with comment from administration officials.Read the Defense Department document below:"

Just 24 percent say it should have. (A Pew Research survey released Monday found opinions much closer to evenly split: 48 percent of Americans in that poll said that the U.S. made the wrong decision by using military force in Iraq, but 43 percent responded that the country made the right decision.)Just 4 percent of those in the HuffPost/YouGov survey say they believe history will judge the war as a complete success, with 19 percent saying it will be seen as more of a success than a failure, 36 percent that it will be seen as more of a failure than a success, and 19 percent that it will go down as a complete failure. Slightly over a 10th say they believe the war in Iraq reduced the threat of terrorism, while 37 percent say it increased it. Opinions of the war remain starkly partisan. Two-thirds of Democrats but just 35 percent of Republicans say the U.S. should not have sent troops into Iraq. Although relatively few in either party believe the war will go down as a success, Democrats say by a 51-percentage-point margin that the war will be judged as more of a failure, while Republicans agree by a much narrower 6-point margin.Twenty-two percent of Americans, including a plurality of Republicans, still say that, to the best of their knowledge, Iraq had weapons of mass destruction when the U.S. invaded in 2003, while 44 percent say Iraq didn’t have any WMDs. An additional 34 percent aren’t sure. By a 7-point margin, 37 percent to 30 percent, Americans say that former president George W. Bush lied about weapons of mass destruction in order to get the U.S. into the Iraq War.Americans’ memories of the invasion may be fading. Just over a third say they have a very clear recollection of what led the United States to send troops to Iraq, and only about two-thirds say that they remember even somewhat well.Many people are also now misremembering ― or unwilling to admit ― that they ever supported the war. As YouGov’s Kathy Frankovic has noted, support for going into Iraq topped 60 percent at the time of the invasion. But just a third of Americans now claim that, back in 2003, they favored sending troops to Iraq, while 39 percent say they opposed it, and the rest that they don’t remember. Gallup polling 15 years ago found that about half of Democrats supported the war, a level that’s more than twice as high as the share of Democrats in the HuffPost/YouGov survey who now claim they supported the war at its outset.Use the widget below to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted March 15-16 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aafcc6c1e000008087af1a4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Tennis great Martina Navratilova said her salary for Wimbledon commentary was no match for John McEnroe’s ― and she’s slamming the BBC for the disparity.Navratilova said in a BBC Panorama documentary to air Monday that McEnroe earned at least 10 times more than she did for BBC coverage of the Grand Slam tournament.“It’s hard to really compare exactly because some people work a little longer days, maybe a few more programs or whatever,” Navratilova said in a preview clip of “Britain’s Equal Pay Scandal,” posted by BBC Panorama (watch above). “But overall, it was a shock because John McEnroe makes at least 150,000 pounds. I get about 15,000 pounds for Wimbledon. And unless John McEnroe’s doing a whole bunch of stuff outside of Wimbledon, he’s getting at least 10 times as much money than I am for very comparable work.”Navratilova made about 10 appearances compared with 30 for McEnroe during Wimbledon, BBC Panorama estimated, per the Telegraph.BBC Sport told the Guardian that McEnroe’s participation was of “a different scale, scope and time commitment.”“Along with Sue Barker, John is regarded as the face of our Wimbledon coverage,” a spokeswoman said. “He is a defining voice within the BBC’s coverage. He is widely considered to be the best expert/commentator in the sport, highly valued by our audiences and his contract means he cannot work for another UK broadcaster without our permission. His pay reflects all of this – gender isn’t a factor.”McEnroe’s earnings came to light last year when the BBC published a list of its highest-paid personalities, putting his pay between £150,000 and £199,999 ($210,560 to $280,740), HuffPost UK reported. The tennis championships last about two weeks.When told that the BBC may use McEnroe’s greater hours as a defense, Navratilova said the disparity still didn’t add up. She said she was told that she and McEnroe were making a comparable wage.“It makes me angry for the other women that I think go through this,” she said.Reps for McEnroe didn’t immediately respond to a HuffPost request for comment."
9,POLITICS,GOP Congressman Once Said LGBTQ People Would Wed 'Everyone In California With AIDS',Eliot Nelson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/steve-pearce-same-sex-marriage-aids_us_5aafd39de4b0e8623839d1a4,"Rep. Steve Pearce had a theory about marriage equality leading to health care, which he implied was bad.",2018-03-19,Rep. Steve Pearce is now running for governor of New Mexico.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aafd6341e000008087af1c3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Rep. Steve Pearce (R-N.M.) once said that same-sex marriage would lead to “polymorphism” and an onslaught of people “marrying everyone in California with AIDS” to obtain health benefits for them.In a YouTube video apparently recorded on Sept. 20, 2008, Pearce discusses same-sex marriage, which at the time was recognized in only two states and was the subject of intense national debate. “What’s going on with gay marriage is ... the redefining of a social institution. And the redefinition has serious downside results,” Pearce says in the video. “The next step then is polymorphism, where one marries many.”The video, which was posted to YouTube in October 2008, is described as occurring at an event the previous month in Carrizozo, New Mexico. It was recently identified by the progressive American Bridge 21st Century PAC and sent to HuffPost.Pearce goes on to say that gay marriage would beget widespread fraud.“Where this all gets headed is toward the access to benefits, and so you can imagine that a person would say, ‘Oh all these people in California don’t have access to AIDS treatments.’ ... They might say this to themselves: ‘I’m gonna marry everybody in California with AIDS,’ and suddenly they’ve got access to the, maybe the benefit program, the health insurance that a single person has.”While Pearce spokeswoman Keeley Christensen could not confirm the event’s date and location, she mostly did not distance the seven-term congressman from the remarks.“Congressman Pearce believes the government should not be involved in redefining marriage. He personally believes marriage is between a man and a woman,” said Christensen. “The issue, however, is settled law.”Pearce is running unopposed in the Republican primary to replace two-term Gov. Susana Martinez (R-N.M.), whom state law bars from seeking re-election this year. U.S. Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham, whose district covers Albuquerque and much of its outlying areas, is the favorite to win the Democratic nomination, but is facing challenges from Jeff Apodaca, a businessman and son of former Gov. Jerry Apodaca, and state Sen. Joe Cervantes.The Democratic Governors Association denounced Pearce’s remarks in a statement to HuffPost.“These offensive comments only further confirm that Steve Pearce is too extreme for New Mexico,” said association press secretary Melissa Miller. “The state’s next governor will have their work cut out for them to turn New Mexico around from Governor Martinez’ mismanagement, and that can only happen with leadership that values making an inclusive economy that works for every New Mexican, not pushing an extreme social agenda.”Pearce, who has a deeply conservative track record in Congress and is a member of the ultra conservative House Freedom Caucus, has a long history of making inflammatory comments about social issues.In his 2014 memoirs, he wrote that his family organized itself upon the biblical principle that the wife is to “voluntarily submit” to the husband.“The wife is to voluntarily submit, just as the husband is to lovingly lead and sacrifice,” Pearce wrote. “The husband’s part is to show up during the times of deep stress, take the leadership role and be accountable for the outcome, blaming no one else.”In a 2004 debate, as reported by The Associated Press, Pearce challenged same-sex marriage on both biological and cultural grounds.“Nature is the one that describes marriage as between a man and a woman, designed to support a family,” Pearce said. “In my opinion, same-sex marriages do not advance our culture at all.”"

California is investing $25 million to get more women into the business.",2018-03-19,"<p>Sara Glascock, an electrician’s apprentice, stands at her job site at the San Francisco International Airport. For women, breaking into construction can be tough. “Pre-apprenticeships” can give them an extra edge.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aafc3d01e0000fe077af17e.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Teresa WiltzSAN JOSE, Calif. — She likes to say that she slept through the last 13 years of her life, and indeed, much of it is a blur: Abusive relationship. His-and-her arrests for domestic violence. Meth habit. A period of quasi-homelessness. A 37-day stint in jail for petty theft.Now, at 38, Sandra Alvarez says she is awake — and duly awoken, she is aiming for a massive do-over: She’s newly sober. She’s off cash assistance. She’s got a job temping and a place to call her own. And most importantly, she’s got career aspirations: She wants to work in construction.“The first time I went on a construction site, I felt some kind of power,” said Alvarez, sturdy and tattooed with a swath of dark, wavy hair. “It’s weird, but I felt like I belonged.”But the construction field is a hard one to crack, particularly if you’re female. Women comprise less than 3 percent of the trade workforce, roughly the same portion as 30 years ago. The barriers are many. Sexism is a given — like the foreman who told Alvarez he didn’t need her help on his job site, but sure could use her help in the bedroom.So Alvarez is hanging her hopes on a state-funded “pre-apprenticeship” program in California, where she is learning the basics of the industry, from blueprints and construction math to job safety. Above all, she’ll learn which trade would suit her best. Carpenter or electrician? Ironworker or pipefitter? (She’s pretty sure carpentry is her thing.)The goal: With some training under her belt — and with some industry contacts — she’ll land a highly coveted apprenticeship that will lead to a good-paying union job.More women might soon be able to take advantage of similar programs.These days, states are faced with an aging infrastructure and an aging workforce. And just when the country is considering mammoth investments to repair its deteriorating roads, bridges and highways, there’s a shortage of skilled trades workers — which will only get worse as baby boomers enter retirement. California’s new Road Repair and Accountability Act aims to tackle both problems at once.Mostly, it’s an ambitious, $50 billion, 10-year building program that will use a gas tax increase to fund road repairs, bridge maintenance and public transit.But the law also includes an unusual provision: a $25 million investment to get more women like Alvarez into pre-apprenticeships.The idea is to give disadvantaged Californians, including poor women, the tools they need to get accepted into trade apprenticeship schools — and in so doing, reduce the number of people receiving public assistance while moving more people into the workforce. The law’s funding will be used beginning next year by the California Workforce Development Board, which is the statewide coordinator for the pre-apprenticeship training programs.“This creates an avenue for middle-class jobs and benefits,” said Democratic state Sen. Jim Beall, the primary sponsor of the legislation. “A lot of women shy away from construction because of the work environment. We’re trying to change that good ol’ boy, business as usual, construction culture.” Breaking into the industry means combating stereotypes that construction is men’s work. And many women don’t know how to start to prepare for a career in the trades, said Meg Vasey, a onetime electrician and the executive director of Tradeswomen Inc., an Oakland-based training and advocacy group that offers woman-centric pre-apprenticeships.Traditionally, construction newbies enter the industry through a state-regulated apprenticeship. In a way, these programs function much like a medical residency for young doctors: Apprentices earn as they learn, over a three to five year period, laboring under the mentorship of seasoned professionals, with some supplementary classroom instruction. Apprentices can join a union from the start, getting a bump in salary as they complete each level of their training. And ultimately, when they graduate, they land high-paying jobs.But often, to get into these programs, Vasey said, you have to know how and where to find them. Sometimes that means stalking construction sites and begging the foreman to give you a chance. For women in particular, that can be daunting. Other times, there are limited application periods and yearslong waitlists.Pre-apprenticeships can help fill that void, because class curriculums are devised with input from local trades unions, whose members drop in for guest lectures about what it takes to succeed in a particular trade. (Hint: If you’re scared of heights, a career as a roofer might not be the way to go.)The current pre-apprenticeship initiative builds on earlier efforts following President Barack Obama’s 2009 stimulus plan and a 2014 California program for the clean-energy industry, said Tim Rainey, executive director of the California Workforce Development Board. The idea is to get disadvantaged Californians sufficiently trained in the soft skills, like showing up on time, interviewing, and learning how to work on a team, so that they qualify for highly competitive apprenticeships with construction projects.Advocates argue that women, in particular, benefit from that kind of intensive coaching.“You have to be intentional about bringing women into the industry,” says Vasey of Tradeswomen Inc. “Otherwise, they’re going to hire the one-armed, one-eyed, ex-offender male before they hire a woman.”Opening DoorsA small cohort of women started entering the construction industry in the late ’70s and early ’80s, during the full bloom of the women’s liberation movement. At the same time, affirmative action required that the construction trades open up to them. In 1978, President Jimmy Carter set a goal to have women constitute at least 6.9 percent of the workforce among construction companies with federal contracts. But women in the trades were met with hazing and hostility. Attrition was high.The only source of federal construction dollars that can be targeted to women and other disadvantaged groups, including pre-apprenticeships, comes through set-asides from federal highway resources allocated to states, said Lauren Sugerman, national policy director of Chicago Women in Trades, an advocacy and training group. But the set-aside is not mandated and most states don’t elect to use it, she said. Maine used the money in the ’90s on a bridge project, and thanks to aggressive enforcement and funding for pre-apprenticeships for women, the numbers of women in construction there jumped to 11 percent, she said.And there’s never been a dedicated stream of funding for pre-apprenticeships for women, she said. Over the years, there have been limited demonstration grants through the Job Training Partnership Act. In 1992, Congress passed the Women in Apprenticeship and Nontraditional Occupations Act, which provides $1 million a year in grants and technical assistance to encourage the employment of women in manufacturing, transportation and construction. But the program reaches only a handful of groups around the country.In California, groups such as PolicyLink, an Oakland-based research and advocacy group focused on economic equity, want the state to do more to ensure that contractors hire graduates from the pre-apprenticeships.But because affirmative action by public employers is illegal in California, Rainey said, the state can’t set specific goals for hiring or training women or other disadvantaged groups.And there’s a chance that the broader transportation law won’t survive. Republicans in the California House are pushing to repeal the law, and voters will decide in November whether to continue paying the gas tax hike.Rising SunAs a means to hire more women and underserved Californians, construction jobs make sense for a lot of reasons. You don’t need a college career to earn a good living: Experienced tradespeople can make between $25 and $50 an hour — even apprentices average $15 an hour to learn on the job.For people who have taken a few detours on their career trajectory, construction can be quite forgiving, said Cesar Diaz, legislative and political director at California’s State Building and Construction Trades Council, AFL-CIO.And unions like it because it trains women with tools they need to be more qualified, Diaz said.“What’s going to change the culture is having more women on the job site, first and foremost.”Many pre-apprenticeship programs are co-ed, but often, the most effective ones are the ones that are exclusively for women, said Vasey of Tradeswomen Inc. To qualify, participants need a GED or high school diploma and proof that they’re eligible to work in the United States. A driver’s license is recommended.At the Rising Sun Energy Center in Berkeley, instructor Ester Sandoval, a compact woman with a pixie haircut and a ready smile, paces the packed room. It’s an all-women’s class, where women take field trips to job sites, brush up on their math skills, learn how to apply for a job, and work out with a trainer so they’ll be strong enough to haul gear and lift pipes. They also learn how to cope in a male-dominated industry: how to deal with bullying and the art of the snappy comeback.The students, a variety of ages and colors, hunker down, all furrowed focus.There’s Annie Batten, 54 and a little shell-shocked after 23 years in prison. There’s Rachel Foreman, 29, a onetime art major who’s working as a house painter after crawling out of addiction and homelessness.And there’s Timberlie Laramie, at 19 one of babies of the group, wiry and bouncing with energy. She’s still in foster care, and said she really wants to be a neurosurgeon. But she needs a job, like, now, and can’t afford to be in school for the next decade. She figures a career in the trades will keep her brain engaged — and pay the bills.Sandoval is part cheerleader, part drill sergeant, pushing the women, urging them to speak up, “raise your voice through your core.”“Fake it till you make it,” Sandoval tells them. “You’ve got to be comfortable talking to folks who don’t look like you.”Folks who happen to be men.’Cause those people who don’t look like you are the ones who have the jobs, she said.Training Around the CountrySeveral other states, among them Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota and West Virginia, have used pre-apprenticeship programs to launch women into careers in construction, cobbling together funding from a variety of sources. Maine was one of the first states to tie public works funding with actively recruiting women to work in construction. In 1994, the Maine Department of Transportation used a $157 million, four-year bridge replacement project as an opportunity to create a more “women-friendly” work environment, funding mentorship programs for women interested in construction. It even offered on-site child care.And in 2006, Illinois lawmakers earmarked $6.25 million to fund pre-apprenticeships for women and other disadvantaged groups as part of an infrastructure bill. But amid the state’s budget crisis, the money dried up in 2014.But California’s plan is unusual in its size and scope. It employs a multi-curriculum approach, exposing students to a variety of trades, from metalworking to pipefitting to plumbing, and it requires that the programs work directly with local unions.“This is part of a trend to make sure that as we invest in roads and transportation, that we’re also making an investment in building a skilled workforce — and that we’re using those public dollars to end those inequities that have shut women out,” said Sugerman, who got her start in the trades as an elevator constructor in 1980.Getting DirtyOn a recent day in the backside of the San Francisco International Airport, Sara Glascock, 38, a sweet-faced woman with green pigtails, is giving a visitor a tour of her job site. Pointing, she shows where she stood on the scissors lift, many feet above ground, and strung wires that hang from the ceilings of the warehouse.Both her parents are professionals with master’s degrees and dreams of sending their daughter to college at Mount Holyoke. “That was never going to happen,” Glascock said, laughing. School never stuck for her. She tested out of high school at 16, and tried on a lot of careers, including stints at Starbucks and coordinating architecture projects. But desk work constricted her. Working with her hands, in the great outdoors, seemed more fun.After she completed two pre-apprenticeship programs, she found work as an electrician’s apprentice.She gets up at 4 every morning, and is out the door before 5, trying to beat the traffic. She brushes her hair in the car, slaps on some makeup, scarfs down some breakfast, and is on the job by 7. She’s off by 3:30, and twice a week, she’s taking apprenticeship night classes as part of her training. She doesn’t get much sleep, and she’s constantly battling carpal tunnel from working with her hands. But she loves it.There are eight women out of 50 students in her class, a big jump from previous classes. And along the way, she’s encountered sexism on the job, like the foreman who wouldn’t make eye contact with her, or the one who just assigned her cleanup and put the more skilled tasks to the male apprentices.This is a typical tactic to hold women back on the job, said Olwyn Brown, a journeyman carpenter who has taught pre-apprentices in Oakland and San Francisco.Because of that, “women aren’t trained as thoroughly,” Brown said. “You have to fight for it.”Glascock lucked out with her current boss, who makes sure that men and women get an equal shot at learning their trade. But even if her next boss turns out to be less enlightened, Glascock said she’s going to keep showing up.“There’s nothing in this world that’s going to prevent me from having a pension and getting $57 an hour,” she said.Starting OverAlvarez leads a life surrounded by men. She lives with her teenage son. She temps as a day laborer at construction sites, where she’s usually the only woman. Her pre-apprenticeship class is co-ed, but the men far outnumber the women.Even the 12-step meeting she goes to here in San Jose is located in an all-male rehab facility. She goes because it meets on Saturday mornings, close to her all-day class with Working Partnerships USA, a community organization located here in the Silicon Valley, and it’s easy to pop out for a quick meeting.But after one Saturday session, right after participants recited the Lord’s Prayer, a heavily tattooed man approached her. “My friend wants to meet you,” he insists, gesturing toward a small man standing nearby. Alvarez demurs. The tattooed man presses.“Why would you do that?” she tells him. An AA meeting, she adds, is hardly the time or place to hit on her.As she walks back to her class, Alvarez frets. She’s trying to stay focused, stay clean, make a real life for herself, but men don’t take her seriously, she says.One man who does take her seriously is her instructor, José Mendez. Back in class, he shows her how to read blueprints and use her engineer’s ruler. She hunkers down with her calculator, looking pleased.“I know it’s not normal for girls to be hitting up construction sites and wanting to work hard,” Alvarez said.But ever since she worked in a hardware store as a teen, she’s been fascinated with the idea of building things. This is where she belongs.“I want to run stuff,” she said. “This is my calling.”Stateline home pageSign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research "

And along the way, she’s encountered sexism on the job, like the foreman who wouldn’t make eye contact with her, or the one who just assigned her cleanup and put the more skilled tasks to the male apprentices.This is a typical tactic to hold women back on the job, said Olwyn Brown, a journeyman carpenter who has taught pre-apprentices in Oakland and San Francisco.Because of that, “women aren’t trained as thoroughly,” Brown said. “You have to fight for it.”Glascock lucked out with her current boss, who makes sure that men and women get an equal shot at learning their trade.

Strampel, the longtime boss of convicted pedophile Larry Nassar and former dean of Michigan State University’s College of Osteopathic Medicine, said in 2016 that he didn’t believe the athletes who accused Nassar of sexual abuse, The Wall Street Journal reports.Strampel supervised Nassar for almost 15 years during Nassar’s tenure as MSU’s team doctor, during which time Nassar sexually abused hundreds of athletes. He stepped down as dean in 2017 due to medical reasons and amid backlash that he had ignored complaints about Nassar. Strampel is still an MSU employee and is named as a defendant in several civil lawsuits against MSU.The Wall Street Journal recently obtained notes from an October 2016 meeting with four students and three MSU administrators about a separate incident of sexual assault between a female and male student. According to the notes, Strampel brushed off the female student’s accusation and pointed to Nassar as an example of how people often lie about abuse:“This just goes to show that none of you learned the most basic lesson in medicine, medicine 101, that you should have learned in your first week: don’t trust your patients,” Dr. Strampel is quoted saying. “Patients lie to get doctors in trouble. And we’re seeing that right now in the news with this Nassar stuff. I don’t think any of these women were actually assaulted by Larry, but Larry didn’t learn that lesson and didn’t have a chaperone in the room, so now they see an opening and they can take advantage of him.”One of the people at the meeting told the news outlet that everyone in the meeting was shocked by Strampel’s comments. “He can’t possibly be serious,” the person said. Read more at The Wall Street Journal. Nassar was fired from MSU over allegations of sexual abuse in September 2016, only a few weeks before this meeting. He was arrested in November of the same year on child pornography charges. A spokeswoman for MSU told HuffPost that the university will not speak on behalf of Strampel, but pointed out that MSU’s interim President John Engler did begin the process of terminating Strampel’s employment in February. “William Strampel did not act with the level of professionalism we expect from individuals who hold senior leadership positions, particularly in a position that involves student and patient safety,” Engler said at the time. “We are sending an unmistakable message today that we will remove employees who do not treat students, faculty, staff or anyone else in our community in an appropriate manner.”The termination process for Strampel could take up to a year. MSU’s College of Osteopathic Medicine did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. Strampel could not be reached for comment. MSU and its administration have been put on blast for how the university failed to protect its students. According to an explosive report from The Detroit News, at least 14 MSU staffers and representatives were told of Nassar’s abuse but did nothing to stop it. According to court records, Nassar abused at least 265 children and young athletes during his time at MSU and as the USA Gymnastics team doctor. Last year, Nassar was sentenced to 60 years in prison on child pornography charges. He was recently sentenced to two separate sentences of up to 175 years on child sexual abuse.

The vice president, who is of Irish descent, and his entourage also joined the marchers for a few blocks and posed for photographs along the way. Pence’s appearance, however, got a brisk reception from some vocal demonstrators along the parade route. A number of attendees held massive rainbow flags as the vice president, a vocal opponent of LGBTQ rights, passed by.Some shouted, “Savannah’s so gay,” while others held placards with messages like “Love is love” and “The devil went down to Georgia.” The moment was captured for posterity on Twitter. Pence’s visit to Savannah came just weeks after a highly publicized online kerfuffle with Olympic figure skater Adam Rippon, who is openly gay. The vice president also made headlines last Friday when he held a breakfast meeting with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, the first openly gay man elected to lead his country. Varadkar had said he planned to address LGBTQ rights during the meeting, which was closed to the media. “I am told Vice President Pence is not a supporter of conversion therapy even though some people have mentioned he is,” Varadkar said. “I am going to be meeting him over breakfast on Friday morning, so if I have the opportunity I will certainly be mentioning the wider issue of equal rights and freedoms for LGBT citizens.”The prime minister didn’t seem too vexed about their meeting being closed, noting, “It allows us have maybe a frank conversation that we wouldn’t be able to have if the media was present.” "

From overcoming a foot injury in 2016 to dominating the 2017 U.S. Open, the tennis star has fought through many obstacles.“It took obviously a lot of hard work, and when I wasn’t playing, I grew a lot in just rehab,” the Grand Slam champ told HuffPost. “It was a tough time, and I think when I was on the court again and I was able to play, I was just so happy to just be back.”The athlete has incorporated her story into a video for the chocolate milk-drinking campaign “Built With Chocolate Milk.” As the first black woman to be part of the campaign, Stephens said she’s using the collaboration to speak about everything from the trials of being a top athlete to what it feels like to be a representative of women of color in tennis.Looking back, Stephens said she knows her determination is what propelled her to where she is now. After her January 2017 foot surgery, she trained, worked at the Tennis Channel and prepared for her return. But she never expected to win the U.S. Open in August, just a month after her comeback. “There was no real thought to it,” she said. “It was just getting out here and playing.”However, there was one person who knew from the beginning that Stephens would dominate.At the beginning of last year’s U.S. Open, Stephens crossed paths with sportscaster and former professional tennis player Mary Carillo, whom she’d met while at the Tennis Channel. It was the beginning of the tournament, and while Sloane was just happy to be back, Carillo saw more.“She’s like, ‘You’re playing so great, I think you could win the U.S. Open.’ And I was like, ‘I don’t really know about that,’” Stephens joked. “But I was just so focused on having a good time and just having fun that everything just kind of fell into place. I think the journey is just perseverance and just kinda staying true to yourself.”Tennis, like golf and swimming, is a sport typically marketed to whiter audiences, with notoriously few women of color represented at its top levels. Yet from Venus and Serena Williams to Chanda Rubin and Zina Garrison, there have been numerous women breaking barriers and changing norms. Now Stephens is one of them, too.“They set so many standards for us, and I think without them having done it already before, I think it would be a little bit different for me,” Stephens said. “But once one person does it, I think it kinda opens the door for others.”Stephens went on to detail just how important it is for young boys and girls to see themselves reflected in tennis and beyond. She remembers singer Kelly Rowland in her Destiny’s Child era as one of the main people she looked up to, simply because they looked alike.“Things like that I think are really impactful,” she said. “So, in the position I am in now, I’m happy because little girls and little boys can look up to me, and I think it’s a great position to be in.”Whether or not tennis is a person’s chosen path, Stephens says the goal is always to be an example and keep yourself focused on the bigger picture.“Life is like a long journey,” she tells those who want to follow in her footsteps.“There’s gonna be so many high highs and there’s gonna be some really low lows that you kinda just have to take in stride. You never know when your comeback or success is right around the corner.”"
16,POLITICS,John Kelly Sure Seems Like A Jerk,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-kelly-jerk_us_5ab009a8e4b00549ac7e31ec,"He's humiliated a Cabinet official, lied about a congresswoman and lamented the lack of ""compromise"" in the Civil War.",2018-03-19,Rob Porter (left) lost his job as White House staff secretary after domestic violence accusations became public.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab01cfd1f0000180316ad90.jpeg?ops=crop_13_33_3443_2068%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― When John Kelly took over as President Donald Trump’s chief of staff last July, many in the Washington establishment breathed a sigh of relief. Maybe this man, a retired Marine Corps general who received praise from both sides of the political aisle as well as the media, would be able to restore some dignity to the White House.He would “dial back the drama” and “turn the White House around.” Kelly’s perceived effectiveness was enhanced by the fact that he looked like many people’s expectation of a leader: an older white man with a military bearing. One article noted his “square-jawed” features and said he would be “an imposing and strait-laced figure.”But there’s still been plenty of drama over the past eight months. Trump continues to tweet about random celebrities and make shocking comments about other nations. Now he’s also rapidly hiring all his favorite people on cable news to help him run the nation. And Kelly has been anything but a grown-up holding down “the adult wing of the new regime.” In fact, he’s revealed himself to be a bit of a jerk, even in a job known to attract jerks. (President Barack Obama once joked about how his first chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, lost a middle finger while working at Arby’s, which “rendered him practically mute.”) Rex Tillerson faced a fair amount of humiliation last week when he learned Trump had fired him by reading the news on Twitter. But Kelly decided to make Tillerson’s week even shittier: He told reporters that he had informed Tillerson he would soon be fired at a time when the secretary of state, who was suffering through a stomach bug, was sitting on the toilet.The Daily Beast reported that journalists who were in the off-the-record briefing with the White House chief of staff were “stunned” that this mature adult would share such a personal, embarrassing detail about a man who had just been ousted so unceremoniously. Maybe Kelly just thought it was a funny anecdote. He once made a joke about how Trump should use a sword on the press. Ha. Ha. Kelly also created a significant scandal for Trump when he protected then-White House aide Rob Porter in the face of domestic violence accusations ― with photographic evidence ― made by his ex-wives. Kelly tried to spin his own involvement, claiming that he and other top White House officials didn’t know about the physical abuse allegations and took immediate action when they found out. But other White House aides disputed his characterization, saying Kelly looked the other way on Porter, another official who was supposed to be one of the grown-ups in the room. Trump reportedly blamed not Kelly, but White House communications director Hope Hicks, who was dating Porter at the time. The president believed Hicks put her personal feelings over his best interests. And Kelly, according to a new New York Magazine story, had trouble dealing with Hicks because she was a woman in power. “He was extraordinarily dismissive of her. He would refer to her as ‘the high-schooler,’ he would joke about how she was inexperienced, she was in over her head, she was immature,” a former senior White House official said. “He doesn’t like a woman that potentially has some position of power over him. He thinks women should be subservient to him. If you look at his relationship with Ivanka or Hope — women who aren’t subservient to him — he has problems with those people.”This description fits perfectly with what Kelly himself has said about women ― that they should be “sacred,” like they were in the good old days. In the past, of course, there were fewer women in positions of power in places like the government.Last October, Kelly had another run-in with a powerful woman. When Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.) revealed the callous comments that Trump had made to the family of a fallen U.S. service member, Kelly publicly criticized her and told reporters about past comments from the congresswoman that made her seem selfish and self-glorifying. Video of Wilson’s remarks revealed that Kelly had completely misrepresented them, yet like his boss, he refused to apologize and retract his claims.Kelly has also asserted that the Civil War was caused by “the lack of ability to compromise.” It’s not clear what compromise on the central issue of the war ― slavery ― Kelly would like to have seen. HuffPost reached out to a number of former White House chiefs of staff to ask about Kelly and his conduct. They all either didn’t respond or didn’t want to comment for this article. "
17,POLITICS,Tribes Come Together For Fight To Bring Back Protections For Bears Ears National Monument,Chris D'Angelo,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bears-ears-tribes-monument_us_5aaf32b9e4b0337adf851f76,"“Losing Bears Ears to a cloud of industrial smoke from extraction and mining does not keep that preservation of life for us,” said one Navajo woman.",2018-03-19,"Bears Ears, the twin rock formations of Bears Ears National Monument, are pictured in Utah in 2017. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aafac261f0000180316ac6b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"OLJATO-MONUMENT VALLEY, Utah — Members of the Native American tribes that once came together to petition for the creation of Bears Ears National Monument gathered near the site Sunday to share stories about their connections to the sprawling landscape that the Trump administration recently stripped of certain federal protections.Named after a pair of buttes, Bears Ears is home to thousands of Native American archeological and cultural sites and is considered sacred to many tribes. Tribal elders and other members of the Navajo Nation, Hopi, Zuni and Ute Mountain Ute tribes made it clear at the gathering that they are focused on ensuring the area is given the protections they believe it deserves: nothing less than the 1.35 million acres set aside by President Barack Obama in 2016.Malcolm Lehi, a member of the Ute Mountain Ute tribe who lives near White Mesa, said energy is building in indigenous communities, and lawmakers and government officials can’t turn a blind eye. “It’s a really strong movement,” he said. “I like what I see.” In December, on the recommendation of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, President Donald Trump reduced Bears Ears by 85 percent, cutting it to 201,876 acres, and divided it into two disconnected areas. The Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition, the group of tribes that petitioned for monument status, condemned the move — which opened the door for new mining claims — and filed a legal challenge. That Trump decided to gut Bears Ears came as no surprise, given comments he and Zinke made early in their review of the area. The national monument designation “should never have happened” and was made “over the profound objections” of Utah citizens, Trump said at an executive order signing ceremony. And in a summary report in August, Zinke said the overwhelming number of public comments in support of maintaining the size of Bears Ears and other monuments was simply due to “a well-orchestrated national campaign organized by multiple organizations.” The last few months have only further confirmed critics’ fears about the administration’s motives. Uranium mining company Energy Fuels Resources, a U.S. subsidiary of a Canadian firm, lobbied the administration to dramatically reduce the monument’s size, The Washington Post reported in December. And The New York Times obtained emails via a public records request that show potential future oil extraction played a central role in the decision. The storytelling event on Sunday was organized by Utah Diné Bikéyah, a nonprofit organization working to safeguard Bears Ears and other ancestral lands, and came a little more than a week ahead of public scoping meetings that the Bureau of Land Management is hosting as it plans for how to manage the new, smaller monument. Tara Benally, of the Navajo Nation, said Bears Ears has sustained her people for generations, and that they still use the area for religious ceremonies and to collect food and traditional medicinal plants. “Losing Bears Ears to a cloud of industrial smoke from extraction and mining does not keep that preservation of life for us,” she said.Clark Tenakhongva, an artist and the vice chairman of the Hopi Tribe, echoed that message. The Hopi, he said, believe they were the first to occupy this area and feel a responsibility to protect it. “We do not want or believe that mining is good for our people,” he said at the event. “It may bring revenue, but what are we doing to the Earth?”The tribes say they were ignored throughout the administration’s monthslong review — a claim the Interior Department has dismissed. Zinke did meet with representatives of the tribal coalition last year, but for just one hour. He also toured Bears Ears with several monument opponents, including Utah Gov. Gary Herbert (R) and commissioners of San Juan County, where the monument is located. Zinke sparred with Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) on this topic during a congressional budget hearing last week. Gallego, who has introduced legislation that would protect the monument’s original boundary, asked the former Montana congressman about how many times he had met with industry representatives versus coalition members. Zinke said “all sides were represented” in his recommendation to Trump.Gallego toured Bears Ears over the weekend and ended his visit with a stop at Utah Diné Bikéyah’s event. He told HuffPost that meeting with tribal members and hearing stories about their connections to the area only reinforced for him that the area is worth preserving. Shrinking the monument is an attack on the United States’ public lands and is “stripping parts of, I would say, people’s souls, because the Native American population here is so connected with that,” he said.Gallego added that he expects “a monumental fight” ― one he sees the Trump administration ultimately losing, whether in court or via congressional action.“People are excited about protecting Bears Ears,” he told tribal members. “It’s something we have to continue to work on. But what I see for the first time in a long time is that the movement to protect Bears Ears is on the offense.”"

During phone calls and in-person meetings at a London hotel from November 2017 to January 2018, Nix was recorded bragging that his firm and parent company Strategic Communications Laboratories (SCL) secretly influenced more than 200 elections around the world, including those in Nigeria, Kenya, the Czech Republic, India and Argentina.Cambridge Analytica was also hired by President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign. The firm recently made news for using data acquired by Facebook to build “psychographic profiles” about voters without their knowledge.According to Channel 4′s meetings with Nix, his firm’s methods for influencing an election included putting certain politicians in compromising positions and secretly recording them, as well as conducting their work using fake IDs, websites, and under different company names so that the company’s relationship with the client is not publicly known.“We do incognito very well indeed,” Nix said according to one December interview cited by Channel 4.The company’s chief data officer, Dr. Alex Tayler, is also listed as having attended two of the meetings with the Channel 4 reporter.During another interview in January, Nix reportedly said that one method of finding dirt on a candidate was to essentially create it.“We’ll have a wealthy developer come in, somebody posing as a wealthy developer,” he said. “They will offer a large amount of money to the candidate, to finance his campaign in exchange for land, for instance. We’ll have the whole thing recorded on cameras, we’ll blank out the face of our guy and we post it on the internet.”In another example, the CEO reportedly said the firm will “send some girls,” specifically Ukranian women, to a candidate’s house to seduce the individual, an act that Nix said “works very well.”“I’m just giving you examples of what can be done and what, what has been done,” he told the reporter.Other methods involved making the public believe inaccurate facts about a certain candidate.“I mean, it sounds a dreadful thing to say, but these are things that don’t necessarily need to be true, as long as they’re believed,” he said.“It’s no good fighting an election campaign on the facts,” Turnbull is reported as saying in November, “because actually it’s all about emotion, it’s all about emotion.”Channel 4 noted that though Turnbull witnessed Nix’s comments on the use of sex workers, during a Dec. 19 interview, Turnbull said his company isn’t “in the business of entrapment” and “lying, making stuff up.”“We wouldn’t send a pretty girl out to seduce a politician and then film them in their bedroom and then release the film. There are companies that do this, but to me, that crosses a line…” Turnbull is reported as saying.A Cambridge Analytica spokesman, cited by Channel 4, denied reports that its firm and affiliates “use entrapment, bribes, or so-called ‘honey-traps’ for any purpose whatsoever ... ”The firm, in a statement to HuffPost, accused Channel 4 of editing the recorded conversations in a way that would deliberately make them appear unethical.Nix, in his own response, admitted to discussing controversial practices with the undercover reporter but said he did so only to humor what he thought was a prospective client.“In playing along with this line of conversation, and partly to spare our ‘client’ from embarrassment, we entertained a series of ludicrous hypothetical scenarios. I am aware how this looks, but it is simply not the case,” Nix stated.View Part 1 of Channel 4′s “Data, Democracy and Dirty Tricks” series."
19,POLITICS,Trump Loved Hacks. But Now They're Hitting His People — And Anyone Could Be Next.,Jessica Schulberg and Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-hacks-elliott-broidy-clinton-otaiba_us_5aac131fe4b0337adf83a4aa,The hackers are improving their strategies for stealing private emails to sway public actions.,2018-03-19,"GOP fundraiser Elliott Broidy and his wife, Robin Rosenzweig, have been embarrassed or worse by a recent hack of his emails.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aac1ac72000007d06eb22ba.jpeg?cache=wBqFNm0jrz&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — Few moments in the 2016 presidential election delighted Donald Trump more than the hacking of Democratic operatives. In July, after the Democratic National Committee’s emails were posted online, he — perhaps jokingly — called for more hacks: “Russia: If you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.” When WikiLeaks released the emails of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta in October, Trump was ecstatic. “I love WikiLeaks!” he declared. He said “WikiLeaks” at least 141 times the month before the election.Trump probably didn’t mean to invite hackers to target him and his allies and post their findings on WikiLeaks.But politically motivated hacks and leaks have continued unabated since Trump won the election. White House chief of staff John Kelly’s personal cell phone may have been compromised while he was working on the transition team at the end of 2016. Outgoing White House communications director Hope Hicks told the Senate Intelligence Committee last month that one of her email accounts had been hacked. And Trump associates and others outside the administration have seen their emails hacked and released for political purposes. Yousef Al Otaiba, the United Arab Emirates ambassador to the United States, had his emails leaked to U.S. media outlets.So did Trump confidant and top Republican fundraiser Elliott Broidy.Broidy acknowledges the similarities between the hackers who targeted him last month and those who targeted Democratic operatives during the election. “For whatever reasons, they don’t agree with what someone’s doing, so they try to wreak havoc and destroy their reputation,” he told HuffPost.The 2016 election hack wasn’t the first of its kind. But it was the most spectacular. And given the gambit’s success, it may be hard for any government, organization or powerful individual that wants to influence U.S. public opinion to resist trying to copy it.“Everyone involved in politics — whether you’re on a more state-focused campaign or national — you’re going to be heavily targeted, especially seeing the success of what happened,” said Ben Johnson, a former cybersecurity specialist at the National Security Agency. “Everyone is a target, from the intern to the candidate.”Hillary Clinton’s aides and allies warned that they weren’t the first, and wouldn’t be the last, to be hurt by politically motivated hacking and that the U.S. government should take the threat seriously. Even Broidy now seems to agree.“I’m not happy to see anyone hacked. That includes whether it’s Hillary Clinton or John Podesta, or anyone else,” Broidy said. “What happened in the 2016 election, or what’s happened to me, or what will happen to somebody else today or tomorrow — it’s just not right and I think we should work hard to make sure it doesn’t happen.”Not all state-sponsored hacks have been aimed at the political process. China and North Korea, which are allegedly behind some of the highest-profile hacks, have stolen information with the apparent goals of obtaining intelligence, accessing trade secrets or securing a ransom. When the U.S. and Israel allegedly deployed an advanced team of hackers in Iran, their aim was to destroy a critical part of Iran’s nuclear program.About a decade ago, hackers demonstrated how to use stolen information to advance a political narrative. Thousands of private emails sent by scientists affiliated with the Climatic Research Unit at England’s University of East Anglia were hacked in 2009. WikiLeaks published those materials and climate change deniers seized on parts of the emails to accuse the authors of scientific misconduct and fabricating a pattern of global warming.Climategate, as it was termed, broke just weeks before a United Nations climate conference in Copenhagen, Denmark. Negotiations over ways to curb greenhouse gas emissions collapsed.The release of the emails appeared to be timed to disrupt the conference, although it’s unclear how much damage they did. The stolen zip file was stored on a server in Russia, but investigators never conclusively attributed the hack to Moscow. Regardless of who orchestrated it, Climategate was an early example of hackers plotting to “take the fruits of illegal behavior, weaponize them, then use them in a political context,” Podesta told Mother Jones.In 2013, the hacker Guccifer, later revealed to be a Romanian individual named Marcel Lazăr Lehel, began releasing emails he’d stolen from U.S. political figures. He leaked emails from former Secretary of State Colin Powell, former Bill Clinton adviser Sidney Blumenthal, and Dorothy Bush Koch, the sister of George W. Bush. There is no public proof that Lehel’s efforts were state-sanctioned.The hackers who later targeted the DNC and Podesta adopted Guccifer’s persona, referring to themselves as Guccifer 2.0. WikiLeaks dumped the first cache of stolen emails about Hillary Clinton and the party’s internal deliberations only days before the Democratic convention. Podesta’s emails were posted about an hour after The Washington Post’s story about Trump bragging that he could grab women by the genitals in a 2005 “Access Hollywood” recording.The Clinton campaign pleaded with reporters to be cautious about covering the hacked emails. “You’re basically doing Russia’s bidding right now,” Jesse Lehrich, a former campaign spokesman, recalled telling the media.But Lehrich’s reminders had limited effect. WikiLeaks had already posted the emails online for anyone to read and some of them contained newsworthy information about a major presidential candidate. “Unless there’s a giant pact among reporters that nobody will cover this stuff — which, let’s face it, is never gonna happen — reporters are trapped in this fucked-up situation,” Lehrich said. “You’re either missing out on stuff people are writing up, fighting a noble battle that’s not actually accomplishing anything. Or you’re furthering the agenda of foreign actors,” he said.Another challenge for reporters — and anyone hoping to capitalize on hacked material — is that it’s often extremely difficult to determine who is responsible for a hack and what their motivations might be. Authentication can be a hurdle: Hackers might slip forged or altered documents into a giant release, which would be hard to catch. The Clinton team refused to confirm on the record the authenticity of any of the emails stolen during the campaign.So far, the Trump administration has done very little to protect the country from cyberattacks. In January 2017, he vowed to appoint a team of experts to deliver a plan to counter hackers within the first 90 days of his presidency. But months passed and Trump’s administration blew through self-imposed deadlines without taking action. When the president signed an executive order on cybersecurity last May, Robert Ackerman, the founder of a cybersecurity venture firm called Allegis Capital, described it as “the skeleton of a policy” that mostly built off existing initiatives. Trump later floated the idea of creating an “impenetrable Cyber Security unit″ — in coordination with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Lawmakers slammed the notion and Trump backed down.Even members of Trump’s own party have blasted him for failing to address the nation’s cyber vulnerabilities. “Unfortunately, leadership from the executive branch on cybersecurity has been weak,” said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) last August.State-sponsored hacking is very tough to identify, track and prevent — especially as hackers develop more sophisticated ways to obscure their identities and hackers-for-hire allow states to direct an operation without leaving their fingerprints. But there are things the U.S. government can and should do.Experts have long urged the government to take a more active role in protecting critical infrastructure ― like power grids, water systems and emergency services ― and in regulating security standards for internet-accessible consumer products ― like cameras, thermostats and baby monitors. They also have pressed the federal government to give states the money to replace easily hackable touch-screen voting machines.And now that Trump is in power, he, his allies and coworkers, and his correspondents are targets as well — not just for Russia, but for anyone in the world who wants to sway American public opinion.“This is not going away anytime soon,” said Hank Thomas, the CEO and founder of Strategic Cyber Ventures. “Hacking is far too lucrative and inexpensive for governments to not keep it as a primary tool in their arsenal of defense and espionage tools.”The purpose of the DNC and Podesta hacks was to dump a massive amount of information online all at once and to allow everyone to comb through it, craft their own conspiracies or disinformation, and spread it quickly on social media. More recent hacks have been carefully curated and delivered to the reporters who knew best how to tell the story the hackers wanted the public to hear.Last summer, a group that called itself GlobalLeaks selectively released to several media outlets, including HuffPost, emails belonging to Yousef Al Otaiba, the UAE’s influential ambassador who is close to presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner. The name GlobalLeaks appeared to be a nod to DCLeaks, the group that had distributed the Democratic emails during the 2016 election.But unlike DCLeaks, GlobalLeaks targeted just one politically prominent individual: Otaiba. And instead of just being dumped online, the documents were leaked to specific reporters who wrote about foreign policy and the Middle East.The emails, which showed Otaiba repeatedly criticizing Trump, were released amid a diplomatic crisis between the UAE (and others) and Qatar. Otaiba had been carefully cultivating ties to the new administration, working to gain Washington’s support in cutting off Qatar and its broader foreign policy agenda. The leaker denied having connections to Qatar. The source used a .ru email address, suggesting they were Russian or trying to appear Russian.It’s not clear what, if any, effect the stolen emails had on Trump’s view of the Gulf dispute. Over the next several months, he flip-flopped between accusing Qatar of funding terrorism and offering to help Qatar resolve the rift with its neighbors. But the emails undoubtedly sullied Otaiba’s reputation in Washington. Last August, the Intercept published an account of Otaiba hiring escorts. The story relied, in part, on those emails.Then last month, the hacking hit someone with personal ties to the president: Broidy. On Feb. 28, a group identifying itself as LA Confidential emailed reporters, again including at HuffPost, copies of the GOP fundraiser’s emails. The documents appeared to show Broidy trying to use his connections to the Trump administration to influence the outcome of a Justice Department investigation into a potential client of his wife’s law firm. (Broidy denies any wrongdoing.) They also show Broidy privately pitching Trump on the idea of a Gulf-funded Muslim army to fight America’s wars.Broidy, who is outspokenly critical of Qatar, has accused the small gas-rich nation of orchestrating the hack. He told HuffPost that he would share proof to back up his allegation at a later date. Qatar denies it was involved in the hack. He has not discussed the threat of state-sponsored hacking operations with Trump, Broidy said. Nor does he share the frustration of Trump’s critics, who say the president hasn’t done enough to respond to Russia’s election interference. “I’m more interested in law enforcement doing its job because the laws and the policies are there,” he said.Asked how he reacted when the DNC and Podesta emails were released during the presidential race, Broidy said he couldn’t recall. “I mean I don’t think stealing stuff from people is right,” he said. “It’s just not my thing. I’m very interested in national security and law and order.”Lehrich, the Clinton campaign spokesman, said he does have sympathy for Republican hacking victims like Broidy.“This guy Broidy seems like a really bad dude, and the things that he’s done, obviously there is merit to them being exposed,” Lehrich said. “But at the same time, I think it’s a dangerous, slippery slope when they’re coming to light thanks to hostile foreign actors who have their own agenda.”Maxwell Strachan and Akbar Shahid Ahmed contributed reporting.

20,POLITICS,Trump Loved Hacks. But Now They're Hitting His People — And Anyone Could Be Next.,Jessica Schulberg and Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-hacks-elliott-broidy-clinton-otaiba_us_5aac131fe4b0337adf83a4aa,The hackers are improving their strategies for stealing private emails to sway public actions.,2018-03-19,"Hackers stole emails from Ambassador Yousef Al Otaiba, of the United Arab Emirates, in which he criticizes President Donald Trump.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aac17c22000007d06eb22b5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — Few moments in the 2016 presidential election delighted Donald Trump more than the hacking of Democratic operatives. In July, after the Democratic National Committee’s emails were posted online, he — perhaps jokingly — called for more hacks: “Russia: If you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.” When WikiLeaks released the emails of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta in October, Trump was ecstatic. “I love WikiLeaks!” he declared. He said “WikiLeaks” at least 141 times the month before the election.Trump probably didn’t mean to invite hackers to target him and his allies and post their findings on WikiLeaks.But politically motivated hacks and leaks have continued unabated since Trump won the election. White House chief of staff John Kelly’s personal cell phone may have been compromised while he was working on the transition team at the end of 2016. Outgoing White House communications director Hope Hicks told the Senate Intelligence Committee last month that one of her email accounts had been hacked. And Trump associates and others outside the administration have seen their emails hacked and released for political purposes. Yousef Al Otaiba, the United Arab Emirates ambassador to the United States, had his emails leaked to U.S. media outlets.So did Trump confidant and top Republican fundraiser Elliott Broidy.Broidy acknowledges the similarities between the hackers who targeted him last month and those who targeted Democratic operatives during the election. “For whatever reasons, they don’t agree with what someone’s doing, so they try to wreak havoc and destroy their reputation,” he told HuffPost.The 2016 election hack wasn’t the first of its kind. But it was the most spectacular. And given the gambit’s success, it may be hard for any government, organization or powerful individual that wants to influence U.S. public opinion to resist trying to copy it.“Everyone involved in politics — whether you’re on a more state-focused campaign or national — you’re going to be heavily targeted, especially seeing the success of what happened,” said Ben Johnson, a former cybersecurity specialist at the National Security Agency. “Everyone is a target, from the intern to the candidate.”Hillary Clinton’s aides and allies warned that they weren’t the first, and wouldn’t be the last, to be hurt by politically motivated hacking and that the U.S. government should take the threat seriously. Even Broidy now seems to agree.“I’m not happy to see anyone hacked. That includes whether it’s Hillary Clinton or John Podesta, or anyone else,” Broidy said. “What happened in the 2016 election, or what’s happened to me, or what will happen to somebody else today or tomorrow — it’s just not right and I think we should work hard to make sure it doesn’t happen.”Not all state-sponsored hacks have been aimed at the political process. China and North Korea, which are allegedly behind some of the highest-profile hacks, have stolen information with the apparent goals of obtaining intelligence, accessing trade secrets or securing a ransom. When the U.S. and Israel allegedly deployed an advanced team of hackers in Iran, their aim was to destroy a critical part of Iran’s nuclear program.About a decade ago, hackers demonstrated how to use stolen information to advance a political narrative.

When it comes to activism, the teens say they’re running the show. But there are adults behind the scenes of March for Our Lives: A document uncovered by HuffPost reveals a diverse board of directors that includes public servants, legal experts and professionals based outside of Florida.Money raised for the March for Our Lives Action Fund, a nonprofit, will cover expenses associated with the national student rally taking place in Washington, D.C., on March 24. The money will also be used to “fight for comprehensive gun safety legislation” and to promote voter education, ballot initiatives and lobbying efforts, according to 42 West, the bicoastal entertainment industry public relations firm handling press requests for the campaign. A board that includes six volunteer directors is overseeing all March for Our Lives funds, a spokesperson for 42 West told HuffPost in an email. Decisions on how to spend the funds will be up to that board and a “student advisory board,” the spokesperson said. When asked what sort of oversight mechanisms are set up to ensure the money is going to the students’ desired reforms, the spokesperson said, “The board of directors will handle.” It’s perfectly normal for adults to be involved when millions of dollars are at stake. But other than the document HuffPost discovered, a nonprofit registration filed in Florida and posted on the Florida Department of State’s website, there is little publicly available information about the March for Our Lives Action Fund or who’s running it. The fund’s directors, according to the form, are George Kieffer, chair of the Board of Regents of the University of California; Jeri Rhodes, who is with the Friends Committee on National Legislation, a Washington-based lobbying group founded by Quakers; Aileen Adams; who served under former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa; Nina Vinik, an attorney who has a background in gun violence prevention; Vernetta Walker from BoardSource, an organization that provides support for nonprofit leaders; and Melissa Scholz, an attorney who has expertise in nonprofit law. The fund is organized as a Delaware corporation and operates as a 501(c)(4) nonprofit. The document lists Deena Katz, an Emmy-nominated producer and the co-executive director of the Women’s March Los Angeles Foundation, as president. She is helping organize the March for Our Lives on her own as an individual, a 42 West spokesperson said.The application was linked to an address for a tax consulting firm listed on the March website advising donors where they could mail checks. An employee at the tax firm confirmed that March for Our Lives is a client. (The fund’s board of directors did not immediately respond to a request for comment.) 42 West did not say how much money the fund has raised. The Parkland students who have become the face of the gun control movement have made a concerted effort to show that they’re not simply figureheads of the campaign. Although high-profile gun violence prevention advocates and wealthy donors have taken an interest in the effort, the students are careful not to be used for anyone’s agenda, they said in an interview with “60 Minutes” on Sunday.The teens are allowing those who’ve backed them “to help where they can,” Cameron Kasky, a junior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, told the program. “But we make sure that we are calling the shots.” Kasky, who is 17, noted that he’s not old enough to book a hotel by himself or secure permits for the upcoming Washington rally. But he also said the teens have turned away money from people who offered donations with strings attached.It’s not uncommon for robust fundraising efforts to spring up after a high-profile mass shooting. But they’ve typically focused on covering costs for victims and their families. A separate fund for Parkland victims, coordinated by the Broward Education Foundation, is dedicated to those efforts and has raised more than $4 million, according to the campaign’s GoFundMe page.That makes the March for Our Lives Action Fund, which is focused on national anti-gun violence advocacy, unusual. A petition on the campaign’s website highlights a few possible legislative priorities for the students, including banning assault weapons like the one used at the Parkland school and closing a loophole in federal background check law. With the Parkland students positioning themselves to be an enduring force in the gun policy debate, it’s also possible that these priorities will continue to evolve after the march.Although public details are still vague, a number of high-profile figures have pledged donations. The 42 West spokesperson said they have received donations from Oprah Winfrey (a reported $500,000), George and Amal Clooney ($500,000), Gucci ($500,000) “and other gracious donors.” There is a GoFundMe campaign that had raised more than $3.3 million as of Monday, which is being split equally between the March for Our Lives Action Fund and the Broward Education Foundation.There are also a number of large, progressive figures and groups publicly supporting the march, though it’s unclear what kind of guidance they are providing. The gun safety group named for former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) is continuing to “lend support in any way the students need, especially helping to operationalize these marches, from logistics to programming,” a Giffords spokesman said. A spokesperson for Everytown for Gun Safety, which is assisting in coordinating sibling marches around the country, emphasized that it’s a “student-led effort.” As a 501(c)(4) group, March for Our Lives Action Fund is subject to few public disclosure requirements regarding donors or expenditures, meaning the Parkland students and the board aren’t obligated to be fully transparent.For now, the students seem fired up to continue efforts to fight gun violence in America— even as they acknowledge they’re learning as they go along. “Working with money people and law people and everybody else from home today,” Kasky tweeted last month. “Never thought I’d actually be excited to return to school.” This is a developing story.

23,WOMEN,Muslim Women Forced To Remove Hijab For Mugshots File Civil Rights Lawsuit,Carol Kuruvilla,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/muslim-women-hijab-nypd-mugshots-lawsuit_us_5aafe91ce4b0e862383a206b,"When New York police took a photo of her without a headscarf, plaintiff Jamilla Clark said, ""I felt as if I were naked.""",2018-03-19,Jamilla Clark and Arwa Aziz say the New York Police Department's policy requiring women to remove religious head coverings for booking photos violates their civil rights.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab0058f1e000057107af232.jpeg?cache=gZW8dMaruX&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Two Muslim women who were arrested in New York City last year claim that police officers forced them to remove their hijabs to pose for mugshots despite the women’s tearful objections that doing so would deeply violate their faith. Lawyers for Jamilla Clark and Arwa Aziz filed a federal class-action lawsuit against the city on Friday, seeking unspecified damages and a change to current city policy that requires head coverings to be removed for the police department’s official photo ― even those coverings, like headscarves, that do not obscure a person’s face.“No New Yorker should be robbed of their right to practice their faith simply because they are arrested,” Albert Fox Cahn, a lawyer representing the women, told HuffPost. “We want city-wide reform because too many New Yorkers have already suffered under our existing policy, forced to undress against their will.”Cahn, who is the legal director for the New York chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, contends that the New York Police Department’s policy violates people’s right to religious freedom under the First Amendment and federal law. He said the lawsuit seeks to protect any New Yorker who wears religious head coverings that leave the face visible, including hijabs, yarmulkes, turbans and wigs. “Requiring a Muslim woman to remove her hijab in public is akin to demanding that a secular person strip naked in front of strangers,” the lawsuit argues.Currently, the NYPD’s patrol guide provides that arrestees who refuse to remove their religious head coverings for their official photo should be transported to police headquarters in Manhattan. There, the arrestee can have the picture taken in private by an officer of the same gender. The New York City Law Department said in a statement to The Associated Press that it’s confident the current policy “passes constitutional muster.”“It carefully balances the department’s respect for the customs of all religions with the legitimate law enforcement need to take arrest photos,” the law office said. “Persons who do not wish to remove religious head coverings in front of others have the option of being taken to a separate, more private facility to be photographed.”Clark, a Muslim woman from Cedar Grove, New Jersey, was arrested on Jan. 9, 2017, at Manhattan Family Court for violating a protective order. The lawsuit claims Clark’s abusive former husband had fabricated the charges underlying that order. The charges were later dismissed by prosecutors, The New York Times reports.According to the lawsuit, police officers ordered Clark to remove her hijab to pose for a booking photo. She told them that her religious beliefs barred her from removing her hijab in front of men who did not belong to her immediate family. Police then allegedly informed her that she would be prosecuted if she declined, and one officer made “numerous hostile comments about Muslims,” the lawsuit claims.After being taken to NYPD headquarters, Clark agreed to remove her hijab so that a female officer could take her photo in a private room. But Clark contends that the female officer subsequently showed the photo to approximately five male colleagues.“When they forced me to take off my hijab, I felt as if I were naked. I’m not sure if words can capture how exposed and violated I felt,” Clark said in a CAIR press release.Her lawyers claim that the NYPD maintains at least one photograph of Clark without her hijab in its database. “The existence of this photograph haunts Ms. Clark, who is distressed by the prospect of the photograph being viewed again and again by men who are not members of her immediate family,” the lawsuit says.Aziz, a woman from Brooklyn, New York, contends that she had a similarly distressing experience with New York police. She was arrested on Aug. 30, 2017, for violating a protective order filed “on false pretenses” by a sister-in-law, her lawyers allege. Those charges would also later be dismissed by prosecutors.Officers at Brooklyn Central Booking demanded that Aziz remove her hijab for a photo, according to the lawsuit. She refused, explaining that she wore the hijab for religious reasons. She said she offered to pull the headscarf back slightly to reveal her bangs and hairline, but the officers continued to demand that she remove it entirely. Although they also said she could be transported to NYPD headquarters to take the picture, they allegedly claimed that there was no guarantee a female photographer would be present and that the move would force police to “restart” the entire booking process.Aziz finally agreed to pull the hijab down to her neck. The lawsuit alleges she “wept throughout the entire ordeal” and continues to experience “distress and humiliation” when she thinks about how those pictures may still appear in the NYPD’s database.Turning Point for Women and Families, a Queens-based advocacy group for Muslim survivors of domestic violence, is also listed as a plaintiff in the lawsuit. Its executive director, Robina Niaz, said that fear of police officers can discourage her group’s clients from coming forward with allegations of abuse.“I fear this policy [on head coverings] makes it harder for victims of domestic violence that we serve to report their abusers to the police,” Niaz said in the CAIR press release.The lawsuit seeks to prohibit the NYPD from requiring the removal of “any religious head or hair covering” for the purpose of post-arrest photographs.Cahn declined to comment on how he feels the police department should handle booking photos for Muslim women who wear the niqab or burqa, two types of Islamic garments that cover the face. He said this lawsuit focuses exclusively on the rights of detainees whose religious head coverings leave their faces uncovered.The suit points out that other federal and state entities have policies allowing Muslim women to remain covered in official photos. The U.S. State Department allows religious head coverings in official passport photos. New York’s Department of Motor Vehicles permits women to keep their hijabs on while taking driver’s license photos. Police departments in Michigan, Minnesota and elsewhere also permit religious accommodations in booking photographs. Being forced to publicly remove the hijab, the lawsuit contends, “is a profound defilement of the wearer’s sincerely-held religious beliefs and a violation of her religious practice.”"

25,POLITICS,Exclusive: Wife Of Top Trump Aide Dan Scavino Files For Divorce,Yashar Ali,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-aide-dan-scavino-divorce_us_5aaef507e4b0c33361b1bdcb,"Dan Scavino, 42, has a long history with the Trump family.",2018-03-19,"Dan Scavino with President Donald Trump after the president addressed a joint session of Congress on Feb. 28, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aaef9661e0000fb077af0a8.jpeg?cache=lzs57MFLdz&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Jennifer Scavino, the wife of Dan Scavino, an aide to President Donald Trump who serves as White House social media director, filed for divorce in late January 2018, county records reveal. Scavino, who is one of Trump’s closest aides, holds the title of assistant to the president, the highest-ranking staff position in the White House, one that he shares with aides like Kellyanne Conway, White House Counsel Don McGhan, and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, among others. Jennifer Scavino filed for divorce on Jan. 18, 2018 in Dutchess County, New York, where the Scavinos own a home. In county records, she is listed as the plaintiff, while her husband is listed as the defendant. Not much else is known about the cause of divorce, as the state of New York keeps divorce records under seal, and they can only be accessed by the parties involved and their attorneys. The Scavinos have two children. A wedding announcement in the Poughkeepsie Journal says they were married on Sept. 23, 2000. The White House declined to comment. Jennifer Scavino did not reply to an email requesting comment by the time of publication.Scavino, 42, has a long history with Trump and the Trump family. He met then- businessman Donald J. Trump in 1990, when he served as his caddie, and later served as the general manager of one of his golf clubs. Scavino was just 16 years old at the time. A June 2017 profile of Scavino in Politico characterized him as “the president’s mini-me, a man whose bombast, impulse control and instinct for a good punch match those of his boss.” During the 2016 presidential campaign, Scavino was a constant at Trump’s side and could often be seen at campaign rallies taking photographs or filming video, which he would post on Trump’s social media accounts. Scavino first gained national attention in July 2016 after it was revealed that he was responsible for sourcing and tweeting, from Trump’s account, an image of Hillary Clinton that many critics saw as anti-Semitic because the backdrop was a sea of cash along with a six-pointed star (like the Star of David) and the words “most corrupt candidate ever!” In a tweet posted three days after the controversy erupted, Scavino said, “For the MSM to suggest that I am antisemite is AWFUL. I proudly celebrate holidays w/ my wife’s amazing Jewish family for the past 16 years.” While at the White House, Scavino has continued his bombastic style of tweeting, which has led him to run afoul of the law. In June 2017, after the Democratic-leaning watchdog organization, CREW, filed a complaint, the Office of the Special Counsel said that Scavino had violated the Hatch Act when he tweeted at Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) and encouraged Trump supporters to defeat him. The Hatch Act limits certain political activities of federal government employees. The tweet came about when Trump was in a spat with some members of the Freedom Caucus, of which Amash is a member. The representative had refused to support Trump’s plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act.Outside of controversial tweets, Scavino has generally kept a low profile in the administration, and he has only talked about his wife when referencing his advocacy for Lyme disease awareness and research. Jennifer Scavino has grappled with the disease for over a decade. (Scavino believes his wife got it from a tick bite while she was gardening in their backyard.)Two months before Trump launched his campaign for the presidency in 2015, Scavino tweeted an image of his wife with the caption: “My amazing wife, Jennifer has Chronic Inflammatory Polyneuropathy Disease from a tick, resulting in Lyme Disease. We are both 39 years old. 10 years of this awful neurological disease, she is my hero. Not once feeling sorry for herself or really even talking about it outside of our home. While I had to leave my career, I have and will be with her every step of the way. Today is treatment day. Thoughts & prayers to everyone & anyone with neurological disease.” In July 2015, due to mounting medical expenses, the Scavinos filed for bankruptcy."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ab01af52000003800eb25e6.jpeg?cache=9tIu2H5cMa&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It appears Ben Affleck needs to backtrack on his previous statements about his back tattoo. The actor was spotted training for a film over the weekend in Hawaii, revealing the massive, colorful back tattoo of a phoenix he previously insisted was temporary. (See it around 0:20 in the video above.) Affleck’s gigantic tattoo first rose from the ashes made headlines in July 2015, shortly after he split from Jennifer Garner. Paparazzi finally got a photo of the red, yellow and blue tattoo when the actor was on the set of “Live by Night” later that year. But in an interview with Mario Lopez, Affleck denied the ink was real. “[It’s] fake for a movie,” he said. “I actually do have a number of tattoos but I try to have them in places where you don’t have to do a lot of cover-up. They get sort of addictive, tattoos, after a while.”In an interview with Vanity Fair, Garner made it clear she didn’t approve of her ex’s ink one bit. “You know what we would say in my hometown about that? ‘Bless his heart.’ A phoenix rising from the ashes. Am I the ashes in this scenario?” the actress said in 2016. “I take umbrage. I refuse to be the ashes.” Jennifer Lopez, Affleck’s former fiancee, also didn’t have kind things to say about the tat when she appeared on “Watch What Happens Live” in 2016. “It’s awful! I would tell him that,” she said. “I would tell him, ‘What are you doing?’ It has too many colors. His tattoos always had too many colors.” “They shouldn’t be so colorful,” she added. “They should be, like, cooler. I don’t know.”"
27,POLITICS,Sex Trafficking Bills Backed By Dem Presidential Contenders Could Cause More Harm Than Good,Jenavieve Hatch,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sex-trafficking-sex-worker-reaction-sesta_us_5aa84219e4b0f7a689cd3150,Pressure on websites to screen out ads could expose sex workers to more risks.,2018-03-19,Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) co-sponsored the Stop Enabling Sex Trafficking Act (SESTA).,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aa844941e000008087ae925.jpeg?cache=hcHvIZ4V4k&ops=crop_0_0_3312_1732%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Twenty-four Senate Democrats, including potential presidential candidates Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), have thrown their weight behind a soon-to-pass bill that is supposed to protect sex workers but would actually put them at greater risk by making it harder for them to use the websites they rely on to protect their identities and screen clients, according to sex workers and their advocates.The Senate could vote as early as this week on the Stop Enabling Sex Trafficking Act (SESTA). A version of the legislation easily passed the House, 388-25, late last month. Both proposals would hold online platforms, such as Craigslist and the personal classifieds site Backpage, liable for user content related to sex trafficking. This could encourage websites to censor sex-related ads to protect themselves from litigation, free-speech advocates warn. Sex workers would have to turn to methods that offer less privacy to promote their services, making it tougher to screen clients or warn others about dangerous customers.Voluntary sex work is often conflated with sex trafficking, which is less common than trafficking of people into farm, factory or household labor. But many sex workers are not victims of the sex trade or human trafficking; they are self-supporting and have decided for themselves to do the work. Given harsh prostitution laws across the country, sex workers often work underground and depend on sites like Backpage, which allow users to screen clients, protect their identities and find clients.SESTA’s opponents argue that making websites liable for sex trafficking-related content will push both sex trafficking and voluntary sex work further underground ― leaving trafficking victims and voluntary sex workers worse off than they are now. Once websites are legally liable for user-related content related to sex trafficking, they’ll turn to automated filters to find and delete that content, predicted Elliot Harmon, an activist at Election Freedom Frontier. But automated filters, while useful to site moderators, aren’t an effective method of monitoring content, leading to needless censorship. Google’s PerspectiveAPI, an automated filter meant to monitor “toxicity” in online discussions, was unable to differentiate between “I am a Jew” and “I don’t like Jews.” There’s no reason to believe automated filters will be any better at differentiating between ads for voluntary sex work and those tied to sex trafficking than they were at identifying anti-Semitism, Harmon added. And sites that can’t post sex workers’ ads without fear of being sued probably won’t post them at all. And pushing sex work-related ads offline will leave sex-trafficking victims even worse off than they are now, said Jean Bruggeman, executive director of Freedom Network USA, an advocacy group that supports victims of human trafficking. Ads for sex work that appear online are easier to monitor and track than ones that appear elsewhere, Bruggeman noted. Without an online platform, sex traffickers and their victims will be more difficult to track down; having a digital footprint is actually helpful when it comes to finding and rescuing victims. “When websites are shut down, the sex trade is pushed underground and sex trafficking victims are forced into even more dangerous circumstances,” Bruggeman said. Under SESTA, “trafficking victims face even more violence, are less likely to be identified, with less evidence of their victimization.”  SESTA “boasts of being the answer to uncovering and punishing those engaged in sex trafficking online, but what it actually is about is internet censorship,” Briq House, communications director for the Sex Worker Outreach Project-USA, which promotes the decriminalization of sex work, wrote last summer. “Without proper ways to establish identity, set service boundaries and screen people properly, this bill could turn casual meet-ups into life-or-death situation.”The bill is cruising toward passage anyway. Its most prominent Democratic backers were reluctant to address sex workers’ critiques of the measure.Harris, who as California attorney general charged the CEO of Backpage with felony pimping, did not respond to requests for comment, and Gillibrand’s office cited the fact that the bill has broad support from sex trafficking advocacy groups, tech groups and faith leaders. A spokesman for Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), the bill’s Republican author, similarly declined to comment on sex workers’ concerns and also pointed to the list of groups backing the proposal.But some of the bill’s backers insist it will protect women who are at risk.“I have a constituent whose daughter was trafficked and then killed using Backpage and these sites,” said Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.). “We have to do something.”“I think we need to do everything we can to try and shut down those websites,” said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.). “But there are a lot of other things we need to do to support victims and to make sure law enforcement has the tools they need.”About a dozen human trafficking organizations have endorsed the bills, including the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the Trafficking in America Task Force and the New Jersey Coalition Against Human Trafficking.“This bill targets the business model of companies like Backpage.com by opening the door to civil liability and allowing states to enforce their trafficking laws when online entities choose to profit from the exploitation of sex trafficking victims,” Christine Raino of Shared Hope International, a religious-based organization focused on preventing sex trafficking, wrote in support of the measure. Major websites including Facebook, Google and Oracle also support SESTA.But several groups that advocate for sex workers are concerned that no one is talking to those who would be most affected. “Sex workers across the country, including survivors of sex trafficking, are vehemently opposed” to both the House and Senate versions, Ty Mitchell wrote for HuffPost Opinion last week. “But lawmakers are not listening to us.” Congress’s attempt to combat sex trafficking is a good thing, Bruggeman said, but these laws are drawn up without consulting sex workers and victims of sex trafficking about their lived experiences. That several feminist senators who are otherwise outspoken advocates for sexual assault survivors support the legislation is also a disappointing factor for many sex workers ― a group often left out of mainstream feminist movements to begin with.“I live in California, and Kamala Harris is my senator. It has been dispiriting, to say the least, to see her zeal in using law enforcement to crack down on voluntary sex workers in an effort to combat trafficking,” Lola Davina, a former sex worker and author, told HuffPost. “I wish Senator Harris would take the time to actually talk directly to voluntary sex workers to learn about their lives and livelihoods. Sex work is often an occupation of last resort that women, queers and trans folk fall back on when they have few other options .… Making their work even more dangerous, more marginal, more stigmatized, more difficult does nothing to help them ― they are collateral damage in the fight against trafficking.”And Davina isn’t sold on the idea that senators have assembled a broad coalition of advocacy groups to back SESTA.“I wish lawmakers would see voluntary sex workers for what they are,” she said. “Small business owners attempting to promote their services, which, when consensual, harm no one.”This article has been updated with comment from Duckworth and Shaheen."

Varadkar, the first openly gay man elected to lead his country, and Barrett watched the Saturday festivities from St. Patrick’s Cathedral in Manhattan before joining the parade next to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D). It was a powerful gesture, given that LGBTQ groups had been banned from participating in the parade until 2015. Among the most outspoken critics of the ban was New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D), who opted for the queer-inclusive St. Pat’s For All Parade in neighboring Queens in 2014.That same year, producers of the Irish dry stout Guinness cited the ban as their incentive to drop their sponsorship of the Manhattan parade. (The company resumed its sponsorship the next year when the ban had been dropped.) The symbolism wasn’t lost on Varadkar. The prime minister said the chance to march with Barrett, a cardiologist who resides in Chicago, by his side was a “real privilege.” “Only a few years ago people couldn’t march under the rainbow banner, but that has all changed,” Varadkar told media at the parade. He added, “I’m going to be able to march in the parade now with my partner which is something that is a sign, I think, of change, a sign of great diversity, not just in Ireland, but in the community here as well.”Cuomo shared similar sentiments, saying he was “proud to march alongside” the prime minister on Twitter Saturday.“Today as every day, New Yorkers know diversity is our greatest strength,” he wrote. The evening before the parade, Varadkar dropped by the Stonewall National Monument in New York’s Greenwich Village for a photo op. The nearby Stonewall Inn and its environs were the site of the 1969 riots considered the symbolic start of the modern day LGBTQ rights movement.It was an eventful, weeklong visit for Varadkar, who took office last June. He reportedly touched on trade, military assistance and cybersecurity during a March 15 meeting with President Donald Trump at the White House.“He was aware of European affairs in terms of trade, and was also very aware that we have a low tax regime,” Varadkar later said of the meeting. “I wouldn’t say he was an expert on Ireland, but he had an awareness of issues relating to Ireland and gave us a lot of time during the day, which I think was very welcome.”He said he’d planned to address LGBTQ rights with Vice President Mike Pence at a breakfast meeting last Friday, which was closed to the media.

He reportedly touched on trade, military assistance and cybersecurity during a March 15 meeting with President Donald Trump at the White House.“He was aware of European affairs in terms of trade, and was also very aware that we have a low tax regime,” Varadkar later said of the meeting. “I wouldn’t say he was an expert on Ireland, but he had an awareness of issues relating to Ireland and gave us a lot of time during the day, which I think was very welcome.”He said he’d planned to address LGBTQ rights with Vice President Mike Pence at a breakfast meeting last Friday, which was closed to the media.

Lynch and Mark HosenballWASHINGTON, March 18 (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ testimony that he opposed a proposal for President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign team to meet with Russians has been contradicted by three people who told Reuters they have spoken about the matter to investigators with Special Counsel Robert Mueller or congressional committees.Sessions testified before Congress in November 2017 that he “pushed back” against the proposal made by former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos at a March 31, 2016 campaign meeting. Then a senator from Alabama, Sessions chaired the meeting as head of the Trump campaign’s foreign policy team.“Yes, I pushed back,” Sessions told the House Judiciary Committee on Nov. 14, when asked whether he shut down Papadopoulos’ proposed outreach to Russia. Sessions has since also been interviewed by Mueller.Three people who attended the March campaign meeting told Reuters they gave their version of events to FBI agents or congressional investigators probing Russian interference in the 2016 election. Although the accounts they provided to Reuters differed in certain respects, all three, who declined to be identified, said Sessions had expressed no objections to Papadopoulos’ idea.However, another meeting attendee, J.D. Gordon, who was the Trump campaign’s director of national security, told media outlets including Reuters in November that Sessions strongly opposed Papadopoulos’ proposal and said no one should speak of it again. In response to a request for comment, Gordon said on Saturday that he stood by his statement.Sessions, through Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores, declined to comment beyond his prior testimony. The special counsel’s office also declined to comment. Spokeswomen for the Democrats and Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee did not immediately comment.Reuters was unable to determine whether Mueller is probing discrepancies in accounts of the March 2016 meeting.The three accounts, which have not been reported, raise new questions about Sessions’ testimony regarding contacts with Russia during the campaign.Sessions previously failed to disclose to Congress meetings he had with former Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, and testified in October that he was not aware of any campaign representatives communicating with Russians.Some Democrats have seized on discrepancies in Sessions’ testimony to suggest the attorney general may have committed perjury. A criminal charge would require showing Sessions intended to deceive. Sessions told the House Judiciary Committee that he had always told the truth and testified to the best of his recollection.Legal experts expressed mixed views about the significance of the contradictions cited by the three sources.Sessions could argue he misremembered events or perceived his response in a different way, making any contradictions unintentional, some experts said.Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University, said Sessions’ words might be too vague to form the basis of a perjury case because there could be different interpretations of what the term pushing back means.“If you’re talking about false statements, prosecutors look for something that is concrete and clear,” he said.Other legal experts said, however, that repeated misstatements by Sessions could enable prosecutors to build a perjury case against him.“Proving there was intent to lie is a heavy burden for the prosecution. But now you have multiple places where Sessions has arguably made false statements,” said Bennett Gershman, a Pace University law professor.The March 2016 campaign meeting in Washington was memorialized in a photo Trump posted on Instagram of roughly a dozen men sitting around a table, including Trump, Sessions and Papadopoulos.Papadopoulos, who pleaded guilty in October to lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation about his Russia contacts, is now cooperating with Mueller.According to court documents released after his guilty plea, Papadopoulos said at the campaign meeting that he had connections who could help arrange a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.Papadopoulos continued to pursue Russian contacts after the March 2016 meeting and communicated with some campaign officials about his efforts, according to the court documents.Trump has said that he does not remember much of what happened at the “very unimportant” campaign meeting. Trump has said he did not meet Putin before becoming president.Moscow has denied meddling in the election and Trump has denied his campaign colluded with Russia.(Reporting by Karen Freifeld, Sarah N.

And it doesn’t feel to me that they are,” he said.Britain, France and Germany have proposed fresh EU sanctions on Iran over its ballistic missiles program and its role in Syria’s war in a bid to persuade Washington to preserve the 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran, according to a confidential document seen by Reuters.The proposal is part of an EU strategy to save the accord signed by world powers that curbs Tehran’s ability to develop nuclear weapons, namely by showing U.S. President Donald Trump there are other ways to counter Iranian power abroad.Trump delivered an ultimatum to the European signatories on Jan. 12. It said they must agree to “fix the terrible flaws of the Iran nuclear deal,” which was agreed under his predecessor Barack Obama, or he would refuse to extend U.S. sanctions relief on Iran. U.S. sanctions will resume unless Trump issues fresh “waivers” to suspend them on May 12.Asked if he believed Trump would pull out on May 12, the deadline for the president to issue a new waiver to suspend Iran sanctions as part of the deal, Corker responded, “I do.

Ham could have put the shot up easily, but he had the confidence to find me, and I just knocked the shot down.“I think the guys on the team know that I never lose confidence. You’ve just got to always be ready for the opportunity and for the moment.”Poole, a streaky shooter and spot rotation player hitting 37.8 percent of his 3-pointers, entered the game on a cold run, having scored just 16 points in the Wolverines’ previous five games. In contrast, he hit five 3-pointers against Indiana on Dec. 2. He obviously found his stroke at the right time.He finished the game with eight points on 3-of-5 shooting from the field in 11 minutes off the bench.“We had him in the scout team earlier in the year because he was still growing and was not a guy that was in our top nine,” Michigan coach Jim Beilein said of Poole after the game. “And the shot clock would get down and, you know, the first team’s all excited they’re going to get a stop, and he’d put in a buzzer shot.”Davis, meanwhile, was great at the line throughout the game but missed three of his last four free throws as he finished 9-of-12 from the stripe.It was a stunning finish that demonstrated the immense joy and devastating heartbreak the NCAA tournament is known for.The game was tight throughout as both teams struggled to score and traded the lead 17 times. Houston shot 37 percent from the field while Michigan managed to hit 35.6 percent of its field goals.Junior forward Mortiz Wagner did most of the damage for Michigan with 12 points, seven rebounds and three assists while Abdur-Rahkman also logged 12 points. Charles Matthews and Duncan Robinson were the only other Wolverines in double figures with 11 points each.Rob Gray, Houston’s leading scorer, filled up the box score with 23 points and 10 rebounds, but needed 22 shots to get there. Davis put in a productive 35 minutes, logging 17 points and seven rebounds that will be of little solace after he missed those final free throws.Michigan will move on to face the winner of Sunday’s matchup between North Carolina and Texas A&M. The Wolverines will depend on the stifling defense that led them to the Big Ten tournament title and through the first weekend of the NCAA tournament, but will likely need more from their offense to advance to the next round.But Saturday’s not a night for Michigan to contemplate what’s next. It’s a night for celebration. Read more from Yahoo Sports:Loyola Chicago’s Cinderella run continuesThis story was originally published on Yahoo Sports."

Colleen Hanabusa (D-Hawaii) recounted that her grandfathers were among those imprisoned by the U.S. government for their Japanese heritage. The camps, she argued during the hearing, ought to be preserved to mark the memory of that ugly chapter in American history.Several lawmakers and Asian-American civil rights groups criticized Zinke’s ill-timed greeting.Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) slammed the secretary for what she called his “flippant” and “juvenile” comment. Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) addressed the story by tweeting that “racism is not ok.” Hanabusa accused Zinke of perpetuating racial stereotypes.The exchange between Hanabusa and Zinke occurred as she urged the Trump administration to maintain funding for the Japanese American Confinement Sites (JACS) grant program, which provides financial assistance to organizations working to preserve the internment camps. The administration 2019 budget proposal would eliminate this funding."

The Guardian reported it’s unlikely Porter would consent ― Suu Kyi is expected in Sydney this weekend for the ASEAN Australia special summit, at the invitation of the Australian government.International human rights groups have repeatedly denounced Myanmar’s government security forces for carrying out systemic violence against the Rohingya, a Muslim minority group from the country’s Rakhine state.Roughly 700,000 Rohingya have had to flee to neighboring Bangladesh to escape persecution. Human rights group Amnesty International has reported cases of rape, torture and other abuse by state officials, calling the state-sanctioned attacks “apartheid, a crime against humanity,” in a 2017 report.On Monday, a United Nations special rapporteur said that the systemic abuse of Rohingya in Myanmar ”bear[s] the hallmarks of genocide.”Meanwhile, Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, has stayed largely silent on the attacks, dismissing reports of the military’s violence against the Rohingya as “misinformation.”The Australian lawyers were able to apply to prosecute the Myanmar civil leader based on Australia’s recognition of the principle of “universal jurisdiction,” which states that a country can “exercise criminal jurisdiction over individuals responsible for the most serious crimes of international concern regardless of where the conduct occurs … crimes of genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity.”Australian courts are assessing the application to prosecute Suu Kyi for crimes against humanity, according to The Guardian, and a response is expected next week."

McCabe would have been able to retire Sunday. “Breaking Wind from CNN!” he wrote. “Andy McCabe offered deal for lying to FBI and won’t get pension but will get passage in overhead bin on United flight to Oakland to work for scofflaw mayor.”Huckabee was referring to a dog that died this week after it was put in the overhead bin of a United Airlines flight. David Huckabee, the former governor’s son, killed a dog while working as a counselor at a Boy Scouts camp in 1998. Funny stuff, right?President Donald Trump also tweeted about McCabe’s firing on Saturday, and insisted once again that there had been no collusion between his 2016 presidential campaign and Russian operatives.While at the FBI, McCabe apparently wrote detailed memos about his interactions with Trump. He has since given those memos to special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating the relationship between the Trump campaign and Russia. So perhaps the real joke is on the president."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aac80491e000057107aef4a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump has jumped into the lawsuit filed against him by an adult film actress seeking to void a “hush agreement” about their relationship, while his longtime attorney is claiming that they have the right to sue her for at least $20 million.The latest twist comes after the White House initially claimed Trump had nothing to do with Trump Organization lawyer Michael Cohen’s payment of $130,000 to Stephanie Clifford ― better known by her stage name, Stormy Daniels ― just days before the 2016 presidential election.Cohen filed papers Friday to move Clifford’s lawsuit from state court in California to a federal court there. Trump, through Beverly Hills lawyer Charles Harder, filed papers indicating that he agrees with Cohen that the matter belongs in federal court.“Mr. Trump intends to pursue his rights to the fullest extent permitted by law,” Harder wrote.Clifford’s lawyer, Michael Avenatti, early Friday told HuffPost he had heard nothing of Cohen’s upcoming filing but that he welcomed it if it happened.Friday night, after the papers had been filed, he responded on Twitter: “The filing today is yet another bullying tactic from the president and Mr. Cohen. They are now attempting to remove this case to federal [court] in order to increase their chances that the matter will be decided in private arbitration, thus hiding the truth from the public.”Cohen responded early Friday to a HuffPost query about his coming filing by asking for more specifics, but then he never replied to subsequent calls and text messages.One Republican consultant close to the White House said he wasn’t sure how Cohen’s latest tactic serves Trump. “None of this is helpful. None of it,” he said, guessing that Cohen had decided he needed to hit back hard to protect Trump. “If you go after Michael Cohen, he’s going to come after you. He’s going to leave a mark. It doesn’t matter if you’re an ice cream salesman or a porn star. That’s just how Michael is.”In Cohen’s filing ― done in the name of Essential Consultants, the Delaware corporation he created for the purpose of paying Clifford ― he argues that the confidentiality agreement Clifford signed in October 2016 states that each time she violates it, she is liable for $1 million in damages. Cohen “is aware of at least twenty (20) violations by Clifford,” the filing states.“Therefore, EC and/or Defendant Trump have the right to seek liquidated damages against Clifford for her numerous breaches in an amount to be proven with certainty at the Pending Arbitration Proceeding, but which is approximated to already be in excess of twenty million dollars,” the filing states.Harder did not immediately respond to a HuffPost request for comment. He had earlier represented first lady Melania Trump in a lawsuit against the London-based Daily Mail. Before that, Harder had represented pro wrestler Hulk Hogan in his lawsuit against Gawker over its publication of a sex tape involving him.Avenatti, on Twitter, wondered how Trump could simultaneously argue that he had nothing to do with Clifford while also suing her for millions for talking about it.“How can President Donald Trump seek $20 million in damages against my client based on an agreement that he and Mr. Cohen claim Mr. Trump never was a party to and knew nothing about?” he wrote. “The fact that a sitting president is pursuing over $20M in bogus ‘damages’ against a private citizen, who is only trying to tell the public what really happened, is remarkable. Likely unprecedented in our history. We are NOT going away and we will NOT be intimidated.”Last week, Clifford filed a lawsuit against Trump, claiming that the agreement signed in 2016 is “null and void” because the president did not sign the agreement himself. Clifford’s suit claims that she and Cohen signed the so-called hush agreement and a side letter agreement, which stated that her attorney at the time would be paid $130,000 in exchange for Clifford’s silence.Clifford’s suit against Trump claims the two had an intimate relationship that started in the summer of 2006 and continued into 2007. That time period would have been shortly after Trump and new wife Melania’s son was born.White House officials, who have denied any relationship between Trump and Clifford, did not respond to HuffPost queries Friday evening."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aac42c31e0000fb077aef32.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"“Love, Simon” will make history this weekend as Hollywood’s first major studio film to feature a gay teen protagonist. If director Greg Berlanti had his way, however, that wouldn’t be the case.“I wish it wasn’t 2018 and that we weren’t the first teen rom-com with a gay lead to receive major studio backing,” he told HuffPost. “I wish we were the 10 or the 12 – there’d be a lot less pressure in many regards.”Based on Becky Albertalli’s 2015 novel, Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda, the movie follows Simon Spier (played by Nick Robinson), a charming and popular 17-year-old who is struggling to come to terms with his sexuality. He begins corresponding anonymously with another closeted student known as Blue over email, and the budding friendship turns romantic over time. Just as Simon begins to warm up to the idea of pursuing a relationship with Blue beyond a computer screen, a classmate threatens to expose his secret. In some respects, Berlanti’s whole career has been building up to the release of “Love, Simon.” His first feature film, 2000’s “The Broken Hearts Club,” followed a group of gay men on a West Hollywood baseball team. Since then, he’s incorporated LGBTQ themes into a number of his television projects, including “Dawson’s Creek,” “Brothers & Sisters,” “Arrow” and “The Flash.” Yet “Love, Simon” seems poised to make an even bigger impression. In a conversation with HuffPost, Berlanti chatted about making “Love, Simon,” how marriage and fatherhood have affected his artistic perspective and why portraying queer themes in television and film is still “incredibly rewarding.”One of the things that struck me most about “Love, Simon” is how the story felt true to the John Hughes teen rom-com genre, but, at the same time, it’s radical because it’s being told through a queer perspective. Was that your intention?Absolutely. I think that was true of the book, and I think that was true of the script that I read. We had a number of conversations about those iconic movies from the ’80s about coming of age, and mostly technically. The subject matter… was the thing that made it feel contemporary, so we were more focused on, “OK, so how as a film, stylistically, can we emulate some of those movies but let the content be the thing that’s contemporary?” You’ve mentioned that Nick Robinson was your only choice to play Simon. What was it about him as an actor that made you think he would be the perfect person for the role?I loved him in “The Kings of Summer,” and I felt like he had my heart for that whole film. I thought, “OK, this is sort of that movie.” [“Love, Simon”] has some of those qualities on steroids, in terms of the fact that you really have to experience this film through Simon.At the same time, you have to feel like Simon is playing a role in front of all these individuals and hiding this secret, but you’re still engaging with him. Once we sat down and talked about the movie, I could see that Nick was personally connected with the character. Once he did a read for us, it was really obvious not just to me, but to the studio and to all the producers, that he was our Simon, and he had to do the role.One of the high points, for me, was Simon’s determination to own his coming out for himself and his devastation when things don’t really work out that way.I’ve talked to people in the business who are deciding publicly when they should come out, and my advice has always been the same. I say two things: one is the Harvey Milk quote, “Every gay person must come out.” That’s part of your obligation as a gay individual to the next generation, to ultimately tell your story. The caveat always is, “But only you know when that timing is.”I think a person knows when they’re ready, and that timing should be up to that individual. When I came of age and came out, the internet was not as pervasive and social media wasn’t happening yet. So I didn’t have to worry about somebody seeing me out on Facebook and then telling my parents. I got to facilitate my own timing.Another high point is the movie’s soundtrack, which was curated by Bleachers frontman Jack Antonoff. What discussions did you have with Jack about the type of music that Simon would be listening to and would make the most sense in the film?John Hughes’ movies… always had a soundtrack that lived with you well beyond the movie. So that was on my checklist of things I felt the film needed to have. Before Jack said yes to it, he wanted to watch the movie. He was so moved.He rewatched the film with me, and he kept pulling out his iPhone, which has some of the best unreleased songs known to mankind. He just started putting the iPhone up next to the picture, and so many moments in the movie just came alive in a whole new way. When you’re bringing a queer-themed storyline to the big screen or TV, is there ever a fear that the story won’t resonate with those who don’t identify as LGBTQ? How do you address that in the creative process?I think that’s an excellent question. I don’t worry about it. One of the good fortunes of coming out of TV is that you do a lot of testing. They do a lot of research in TV, and so when we got to the movie testing on this film, it was a breeze comparatively.An audience can be from anywhere and they all love to feel something. They all love to laugh and cry. They all love to connect, and the second they connect emotionally with a character, it doesn’t matter what the actor looks like or who that character is. If you can create empathy for the character, they can be as wildly different from the audience as possible, and it doesn’t make a difference.When we tested this film, we tested it in a very liberal state, and then we tested it in a very red state. It tested the same, if not a little bit better, in the red state. They applauded [the ending] just as much as they applauded it in the blue state. Storytelling is storytelling.You’re both a newlywed and a new father. Have marriage and parenthood changed your artistic perspective in any way, or changed the types of stories you’d like to depict on film?Absolutely! I definitely can’t write at night anymore because I’m exhausted at the end of the day. [laughs] I think when you have a child, it’s impossible to not start seeing the world through their eyes, whether you’re teaching them about words or you’re starting to teach them about concepts, and you are extra sensitive ― as I think you should be ― to the input that they’re getting. It’s made me hypersensitive in a lot of new ways that I’m grateful for.You directed one of the movies that really touched me a lot as a young queer person, 2000′s “The Broken Hearts Club.” When you think about your experience directing that film versus “Love, Simon,” has bringing LGBTQ stories to the big screen or TV gotten easier with time?It’s easier in TV, for sure. I haven’t made enough movies to say if it’s easier in film. Everyone involved in this movie, though ― prior to me getting involved ― that decided that they were going to make it was straight, as far as I know. So I think that shows a lot of progress in that regard. As a queer person yourself, do you feel any obligation to represent the LGBTQ community in any specific way in film?Just to make sure I’m doing it. I think that it’s incredibly rewarding for me, because it’s something I understand and am familiar with in my own way. Most of my opportunities came because I was writing about myself and issues that I went through, and those were issues of being a young gay person. It wouldn’t be right if I were to then turn around and not create some of the same opportunities for the next generation of LGBTQ people that have a whole new way of experiencing the world.Are there any aspects of queer life that you’re hoping to explore in future projects that you haven’t already?I really want to get some trans superheroes on my shows.What does the success of “Love, Simon” mean to you?Every time I hear that [“The Broken Hearts Club”] connected with somebody and informed their life in some way, it’s deeply affirming. It reminds me to keep going there as an artist. You want to be the kind of story, whether it’s on TV or in film, that connects with a generation and grows up with them, almost like a friend, and they revisit the way that we all go back to things, stories that we love.This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.

40,QUEER VOICES,"For Greg Berlanti, 'Love, Simon' Is A Pinnacle In A Career Marked By LGBTQ Inclusion",Curtis M. Wong,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/love-simon-greg-berlanti-interview_us_5aa8458ce4b0f7a689cd33a1,"The director says making queer-inclusive projects is ""incredibly rewarding.""",2018-03-17,"""If you can create empathy for the character, they can be as wildly different from the audience as possible, and it doesn’t make a difference,"" Berlanti said of ""Love, Simon."" ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aac5371200000d30ceb22d7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"“Love, Simon” will make history this weekend as Hollywood’s first major studio film to feature a gay teen protagonist. If director Greg Berlanti had his way, however, that wouldn’t be the case.“I wish it wasn’t 2018 and that we weren’t the first teen rom-com with a gay lead to receive major studio backing,” he told HuffPost. “I wish we were the 10 or the 12 – there’d be a lot less pressure in many regards.”Based on Becky Albertalli’s 2015 novel, Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda, the movie follows Simon Spier (played by Nick Robinson), a charming and popular 17-year-old who is struggling to come to terms with his sexuality. He begins corresponding anonymously with another closeted student known as Blue over email, and the budding friendship turns romantic over time. Just as Simon begins to warm up to the idea of pursuing a relationship with Blue beyond a computer screen, a classmate threatens to expose his secret. In some respects, Berlanti’s whole career has been building up to the release of “Love, Simon.” His first feature film, 2000’s “The Broken Hearts Club,” followed a group of gay men on a West Hollywood baseball team. Since then, he’s incorporated LGBTQ themes into a number of his television projects, including “Dawson’s Creek,” “Brothers & Sisters,” “Arrow” and “The Flash.” Yet “Love, Simon” seems poised to make an even bigger impression. In a conversation with HuffPost, Berlanti chatted about making “Love, Simon,” how marriage and fatherhood have affected his artistic perspective and why portraying queer themes in television and film is still “incredibly rewarding.”One of the things that struck me most about “Love, Simon” is how the story felt true to the John Hughes teen rom-com genre, but, at the same time, it’s radical because it’s being told through a queer perspective. Was that your intention?Absolutely. I think that was true of the book, and I think that was true of the script that I read. We had a number of conversations about those iconic movies from the ’80s about coming of age, and mostly technically.

41,WOMEN,Not Every Woman In A Position Of Power Is A Feminist Hero,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gina-haspel-women-power_us_5aabf693e4b0337adf837a81,Gina Haspel’s dark past makes her a complicated figure for feminists to support.,2018-03-17,Donald Trump announced Tuesday that he'd chosen Deputy CIA Director Gina Haspel to run the agency.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aabf6d01e0000fb077aeedd.jpeg?cache=RJo6Z058V5&ops=crop_0_195_2880_2119%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"The world desperately needs more women leaders, but feminists don’t have to love and champion each and every woman who lands in a position of power.This week, Pres. Donald Trump nominated Gina Haspel to run the Central Intelligence Agency. If the Senate confirms her, she will be the first woman to run the CIA in its 70-year history. A female groundbreaker is something to celebrate, right? But Haspel, a veteran CIA operative who’s been with the agency for more than 30 years, comes with controversy. During the Bush years, after the attacks of Sept. 11, Haspel ran a “black site” prison in Thailand that conducted so-called enhanced interrogation ― torture ― that’s since been exposed, called out and halted. There are also charges that she participated in covering up some of these activities. Many civil rights advocates have already decried her nomination. And because of the secretive nature of the CIA, the extent of her involvement remains murky. Pres. Trump made sure to brag that Haspel was the first woman chosen to lead the CIA, and some of his staff amplified the point. But considering Haspel’s dark past, it’s not at all clear that her elevation would be anything like a win for women.“Feminism isn’t about wildly agreeing with all women,” Michelle Ryan, a psychology professor at the University of Exeter in England who studies gender and leadership. “It’s about equality.”Typically, the idea that women each be judged on their individual merits is an argument that conservative women make without much fuss. From the right, this view lines up with a belief in the ascendance of individuality. The argument was endlessly rehashed during the presidential election when women on both sides of the aisle proclaimed that they didn’t have to support Hillary Clinton just because she was a woman. “Women are individuals and can think for themselves and ought to,” said Mona Charen, a senior fellow at the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center. “It’ll be a great day when people react to a woman based on her individual qualities.” The issue of whether or not to celebrate a pioneering woman regardless of her policies isn’t complicated for Charen. A longtime conservative, who chose not to work for George H.W. Bush because he was too much of a “squish,” she doesn’t necessarily think it matters that there are so few women leaders in politics or business. “Women should do what they want to do,” said Charen, who has a book coming out this summer called Sex Matters: How Modern Feminism Lost Touch With Science, Love and Common Sense.“If they want to be leaders, they should be,” she said. If not, that’s OK, too. Charen, who made a name for herself recently by speaking her mind about Republican hypocrisy at a conservative gathering, noted that Haspel has a strong reputation for competence and is fairly widely respected. (A rarity considering the caliber of those in the Trump orbit these days.)Charen’s been making the case for women to be judged individually throughout her career with little controversy. However, when progressives, who are typically more focused on women’s rights, don’t automatically celebrate every woman leader, there is more backlash.It really confuses some conservatives when progressive feminist women don’t automatically support every big-name female leader. But that reveals a naked misunderstanding or indifference to women’s rights ― a presumption that all us girls need is to see a woman in power and the feminist project ends there. You need only look back to the uproar around Sarah Palin in 2008 to see the same issues crop up.Republicans tried to gin up enthusiasm for Palin, simply because she was a woman ― a way to draw votes from frustrated women who had supported Hillary Clinton’s failed bid for the Democratic nomination. They didn’t seem to realize that those women cared about actual policies and ideas, too. It’s not enough that a candidate wear a skirt; she must also espouse policies and ideas that empower the people who wear skirts. Palin did not.“The McCain campaign is cynically trying to recreate the excitement that surrounded Hillary Clinton’s candidacy,” wrote Jessica Valenti in The Guardian at the time. “Believing that all women want is ... another woman.”Kellyanne Conway was the first female presidential campaign manager to win an election. Fox News a while back tried to argue that feminists should therefore love her. Feminists, under this rationale, are also supposed to applaud Sarah Huckabee Sanders for simply being a working mother with a high-profile role.But it’s tough to get psyched about the women in Trump’s orbit. They not only support and enable a man accused multiple times of sexual assault, but who is also openly hostile to policies and positions that would help women.There are a few wrinkles here that probably help add to the confusion on the right. First, in a collective sense we do want to simply see more women in power. Gender equality ― generally ― leads to more fair outcomes for women. Research has shown that the empowerment of more women can lead to more opportunities for women ― new kinds of jobs, pathways to promotion, etc. More women leaders mean that more girls get female role models to look up to and emulate. You have to see it to be it, the argument goes.More women in power also can lead to a reduction in gender discrimination and an increase in pro-women policies, too. We saw this in the fight to keep Obamacare, a policy with huge benefits for women, in place last year ― it was female Republican senators who kept health care alive. There’s even some research that shows that more women in power leads to a reduction in sexual harassment. It is female senators ― on both sides ― who are pushing for paid leave laws right now.Second, feminists are typically inclined to call out sexism, no matter the target. That means they’ve objected to the misogynistic portrayals of Conway, Sanders and Palin — even while disagreeing with their policies and positions.It’ll be interesting to see if Haspel faces a sexist, gendered critique in the coming weeks. She’s expected to face tough questioning over her role in the CIA torture program at her confirmation hearing, which is set for April. She’s already been called “the queen of torture.”Because there are so few women at the top of organizations, the ones who do ascend are judged not just on their merits ― but through the lens of their gender. When a female leader fails, that’s almost always a ding for all women, said Ryan, who is one of the researchers who coined the term “Glass Cliff,” after finding that women were more likely to be thrust into leadership positions at organizations that were already imperiled.It’s possible Haspel’s involvement in the CIA’s program will be judged more harshly because women are often expected to somehow be more moral, empathetic and caring than men: “We don’t expect women to be involved in torturing people,” Ryan said. Would a man be called out in the same way facing the same charges, she asked. (It recalls the way Lynndie England became the face of the horrifying story of torture in Iraq, even as there were so many others involved and making the decisions that enabled her.)Not everyone is that worried about sexism and Haspel.Now that she’s shattered the glass ceiling, Haspel should be judged on her merits, said Juliette Kayyem, former assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security and a lecturer at the Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government. “There’s not a female approach to homeland security,” said Kayyem, who worked under Janet Napolitano during the Obama administration. Interestingly, Kayyem also pointed out that it’s actually been easier for women to reach the top in national security ― Kirstjen M. Nielsen runs DHS currently ― than break through at an operational level. Rank and file agents and officers are still more likely to be men at the CIA, Kayyem said: “It’s not uncommon to be in a room where senior leadership is more diverse than the agents and investigators.”We can applaud Haspel for being the first, Kayyem said. “But we need to know why we’re applauding it. She is a woman who ought to now be judged as we would want a man to be judged.”Or, in other words, she should be judged as we would want any human to be. That’s equality."

Several carriers detached from the cable, and at least one person appeared to be trapped at the terminal under a carrier as others crashed into it.Mountain Resorts Development Co., a state-run company, said in a statement that the “Sadzele ski lift in Gudauri stopped working, chairs crashed into each other with riders suspended in the air, causing health injury of medium gravity,” according to CNN.Georgia’s Interior Ministry has launched an investigation.Ryan Wilkinson, who was in line waiting to board when the malfunction began, told The Guardian that the lift stopped briefly, then started slowly moving in reverse before gaining speed. He also said he saw a “guy in the office smashing on a machine and shouting who seemed powerless to stop it.”“The only thing that stopped it getting worse was the friction caused by the pile-up of chairs at the bottom. People would have kept flying round otherwise,” Wilkinson told the newspaper.“One woman in red was too scared to jump,” he added. “It looked like she’d been spat out of a washing machine when she hit the bottom. It was like a scene from a ‘Final Destination’ film.”Georgia Health Minister David Sergeenko said that the victims were of Georgian, Swedish, Ukrainian and Russian citizenship, including one pregnant Swedish woman, according to multiple reports.One Ukrainian citizen broke his hand and has a head injury, while the pregnant woman had “pain in her waist,” Sergeenko said, according to the Telegraph. The woman and another person were airlifted to a hospital in Tbilisi, about 75 miles from the resort.Mountain Resorts Development said in a statement on Facebook that the malfunction may have been caused by a rope on the chairlift, while the Economy Minister Dimitry Kumsishvili said it may have been caused by an “electricity outage,” according to The Guardian.Mountain Resorts Development has contacted the chairlift’s manufacturer, Doppelmayr Garaventa Group, for more information about the malfunction, according to its statement.A spokesperson for Doppelmayr Garaventa told the Telegraph that it has sent employees to Gudauri to investigate and do not currently know what caused the incident."

They remain hospitalized in critical condition.British officials said Monday it is “highly likely” Russia was behind the Salisbury attack on March 4.The Kremlin’s alleged “record of state-sponsored assassinations” adds to the likelihood that Russia either deliberately carried out the attack or let the poison get into the hands of others, said British Prime Minister Theresa May. Russia has denied any involvement in the poisoning. “At this stage there is nothing to suggest any link to the attempted murders in Salisbury, nor any evidence that he was poisoned,” the police said in a statement.If the Russian government is found to have any ties to the Glushkov’s death or to the poisonings of Skripal and his daughter, the incidents would join a long list of suspected assassinations of Russian dissidents abroad, and specifically in the U.K. Litvinenko, Russian spy, was poisoned in London in an attack that a British government investigation later concluded was “probably approved” by Putin."

AstoreOverseas, the United States is engaged in real wars in which bombs are dropped, missiles are launched, and people (generally not Americans) are killed, wounded, uprooted, and displaced. Yet here at home, there’s nothing real about those wars. Here, it’s phony war all the way. In the last 17 years of “forever war,” this nation hasn’t for one second been mobilized. Taxes are being cut instead of raised. Wartime rationing is a faint memory from the World War II era. No one is being required to sacrifice a thing.Now, ask yourself a simple question: What sort of war requires no sacrifice? What sort of war requires that almost no one in the country waging it take the slightest notice of it?America’s conflicts in distant lands rumble on, even as individual attacks flash like lightning in our news feeds. “Shock and awe” campaigns in Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003, initially celebrated as decisive and game changing, ultimately led nowhere. Various “surges” produced much sound and fury, but missions were left decidedly unaccomplished. More recent strikes by the Trump administration against a Syrian air base or the first use of the most powerful non-nuclear weapon in the U.S. arsenal, the MOAB super-bomb, in Afghanistan flared brightly, only to fizzle even more quickly. These versions of the German blitzkrieg-style attacks of World War II have been lightning assaults that promised much but in the end delivered little. As these flashes of violence send America’s enemies of the moment (and nearby civilians) to early graves, the homeland (that’s us) slumbers. Sounds of war, if heard at all, come from TV or video screens or Hollywood films in local multiplexes.We are, in fact, kept isolated from Washington’s wars, even as America’s warriors traverse a remarkable expanse of the globe, from the Philippines through the Greater Middle East deep into Africa. As conflicts flare and sputter, ramp up and down and up again, Americans have been placed in a form of behavioral lockdown. Little more is expected of us than to be taxpaying spectators or, when it comes to the U.S. military, starry-eyed cheerleaders. Most of the time, those conflicts are not just out of sight, but meant to be out of mind as well. Rare exceptions are moments when our government asks us to mourn U.S. service members like Navy SEAL William “Ryan” Owens, killed in an abortive raid President Trump ordered in Yemen in early 2017 in which children also died (though that was something just about no one here even noticed). While the military has been deploying and striking on a global scale, we’ve been told from the very first moments of Washington’s self-proclaimed war on terror to go shopping or to Disney World and let the experts handle it.We have, in short, been sidelined in what, to draw on the lexicon of World War II, might be thought of as a sitzkrieg, the German term for phony war.A bizarre version of blitzkrieg overseas and an even stranger version of sitzkrieg at home could be said to define this peculiar American moment. These two versions exist in a curiously yin-yang relationship to each other. For how can a nation’s military be engaged in warfare at a near-global level ― blitzing people across vast swaths of the globe ― when its citizens are sitting on their collective duffs, demobilized and mentally disarmed? Such a schizoid state of mind can exist only when it’s in the interest of those in power. Appeals to “patriotism” (especially to revering “our” troops) and an overwhelming atmosphere of secrecy to preserve American “safety” and “security” have been remarkably effective in controlling and stifling interest in the country’s wars and their costs, long before such an interest might morph into dissent or opposition. If you want an image of just how effective this has been, recall the moment in July 2016 when small numbers of earnest war protesters quite literally had the lights turned off on them at the Democratic National Convention.To use an expression I heard more than a few times in my years in the military, when it comes to its wars, the government treats the people like mushrooms, keeping them in the dark and feeding them bullshit.The Fog of Phony WarPrussian war theorist Carl von Clausewitz famously spoke of the “fog of war,” the confusion created by and inherent uncertainty built into that complex human endeavor. As thick as that fog often is, in these years the fog of phony war has proven even thicker and more disorienting.By its very nature, a real war of necessity, of survival, like the Civil War or World War II brings with it clarity of purpose and a demand for results. Poorly performing leaders are relieved of command when not killed outright in combat. Consider the number of mediocre Union generals Abraham Lincoln cycled through before he found Ulysses S. Grant. Consider the number of senior officers relieved during World War II by General George C. Marshall, who knew that, in a global struggle against Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, subpar performances couldn’t be tolerated. In wars of necessity or survival, moreover, the people are invariably involved. In part, they may have little choice, but they also know (or at least believe they know) “why we fight” ― and generally approve of it.Admittedly, even in wars of necessity there are always those who will find ways to duck service. In the Civil War, for example, the rich could pay others to fight in their place. But typically in such wars, everyone serves in some capacity. Necessity demands it.The definition of 21st century phony war, on the other hand, is its lack of clarity, its lack of purpose, its lack of any true imperative for national survival (despite a never-ending hysteria over the “terrorist threat”). The fog it produces is especially disorienting. Americans today have little idea “why we fight” other than a vague sense of fighting them over there (Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Niger, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, etc.) so they won’t kill us here, to cite George W. Bush’s rationale for launching the war on terror. Meanwhile, with such a lack of national involvement and accountability, there’s no pressure for the Pentagon or the rest of the national security state to up its game; there’s no one even to point out that wherever the U.S. military has gone into battle in these years, yet more terror groups have subsequently sprouted like so many malignant weeds. Bureaucracy and mediocrity go unchallenged; massive boosts in military spending reward incompetency and the creation of a series of quagmire-like “generational” wars.Think of it as war on a Möbius strip. More money shoveled into the Pentagon brings more chaos overseas, more imperial overreach, and undoubtedly more blowback here at home, all witnessed ― or rather largely ignored ― by a sitzkrieg citizenry.Of course, for those fighting the wars, they are anything but phony. It’s just that their experience remains largely isolated from that of the rest of us, an isolation that only serves to elevate post-traumatic stress disorder rates, suicides, and the like. When today’s troops come home, they generally suffer in silence and among themselves.America’s New (Phony) National Defense StrategyEven phony wars need enemies. In fact, they may need them more (and more of them) than real wars do. No surprise then that the Trump administration’s recently announced National Defense Strategy (NDS) offers a laundry list of such enemies. China and Russia top it as “revisionist powers” looking to reverse America’s putative victory over Communism in the Cold War. “Rogue” powers like North Korea and Iran are singled out as especially dangerous because of their nuclear ambitions. (The United States, of course, doesn’t have a “rogue” bone in its body, even if it is now devoting at least $1.2 trillion to building a new generation of more usable nuclear weapons.) Nor does the NDS neglect Washington’s need to hammer away at global terrorists until the end of time or to extend “full-spectrum dominance” not just to the traditional realms of combat (land, sea, and air) but also to space and cyberspace.Amid such a plethora of enemies, only one thing is missing in America’s new defense strategy, the very thing that’s been missing all these years, that makes twenty-first-century American war so phony: any sense of national mobilization and shared sacrifice (or its opposite, antiwar resistance). If the United States truly faces all these existential threats to our democracy and our way of life, what are we doing frittering away more than $45 billion annually in a quagmire war in Afghanistan? What are we doing spending staggering sums on exotic weaponry like the F-35 jet fighter (total projected program cost: $1.45 trillion) when we have far more pressing national needs to deal with?Like so much else in Washington in these years, the NDS doesn’t represent a strategy for real war, only a call for more of the same raised to a higher power. That mainly means more money for the Pentagon, the Department of Homeland Security, and related “defense” agencies, facilitating more blitz attacks on various enemies overseas. The formula ― serial blitzkrieg abroad, serial sitzkrieg in the homeland ― adds up to victory, but only for the military-industrial complex.Solutions to SitzkriegOf course, one solution to phony war would be to engage in real war, but for that the famed American way of life would actually have to be endangered. (By Afghans? Syrians? Iraqis? Yemenis? Really?) Congress would then have to declare war; the public would have to be mobilized, a draft undoubtedly reinstated, and taxes raised. And those would be just for starters. A clear strategy would have to be defined and losing generals demoted or dismissed.Who could imagine such an approach when it comes to America’s forever wars? Another solution to phony war would be for the American people to actually start paying attention. The Pentagon would then have to be starved of funds. (With less money, admirals and generals might actually have to think.) All those attacks overseas that blitzed innocents and spread chaos would have to end. Here at home, the cheerleaders would have to put down the pom-poms, stop mindlessly praising the troops for their service, and pick up a few protest signs.In point of fact, America’s all-too-real wars overseas aren’t likely to end until the phony war here at home is dispatched to oblivion.A final thought: Americans tell pollsters that, after all these years of failed wars abroad, they continue to trust the military more than any other societal institution. Consistent with phony war, however, much of that trust is based on ignorance, on not really knowing what that military is doing overseas. So, is there a chance that, one of these days, Americans might actually begin to pay some attention to “their” wars? And if so, would those polls begin to change and how might that military, which has experienced its share of blood, sweat, and tears, respond to such a loss of societal prestige? Beware the anger of the legions.Faith in institutions undergirds democracy. Keeping the people deliberately demobilized and in the dark about the costs and carnage of America’s wars follows a pattern of governmental lying and deceit that stretches from the Vietnam War to the Iraq Wars of 1991 and 2003, to military operations in Afghanistan, Syria, and elsewhere today. Systemic lies and the phony war that goes with them continue to contribute to a slow-motion process of political and social disintegration that could result in a much grimmer future for this country: perhaps an authoritarian one; certainly, a more chaotic and less democratic one.Societal degradation and democratic implosion, caused in part by endless phony war and the lies associated with it, are this country’s real existential enemies, even if you can’t find them listed in any National Defense Strategy. Indeed, the price tag for America’s wars may in the end prove not just heavy but catastrophic.William Astore, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel and history professor, is a TomDispatch regular.

She died Friday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aabd82a2000003800eb222f.jpeg?cache=RUNTZIScrN&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Rep. Louise Slaughter (D-N.Y.), one of the longest-serving women in the U.S. House, died early Friday at the age of 88.She died at George Washington University Hospital, her office confirmed in a statement. She had been hospitalized for a concussion after a fall at her Washington home last week, according to the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle.“As the first chairwoman of the House Rules Committee, Louise blazed a path that many women continue to follow,” said her chief of staff, Liam Fitzsimmons. “It is difficult to find a segment of society that Louise didn’t help shape over the course of more than thirty years in Congress, from health care to genetic nondiscrimination to historic ethics reforms. The Slaughter family is incredibly grateful for all the support during this difficult time. Details on funeral arrangements will be provided when they are available.”Slaughter was elected to Congress in 1986. She was known for championing women’s and reproductive rights during her time in the House. In 2007, she became the first woman to chair the powerful House Rules Committee.Having grown up in Kentucky coal country, Slaughter went on to obtain a bachelor’s degree in microbiology and a master’s degree in public health. She then moved to New York City to work for Procter & Gamble, at which point she became interested in politics. In 1982, she was elected to New York’s State Assembly, where she remained until she won her U.S. House seat and became the first woman to represent western New York.Some of the first policies she helped pass reflected her work as a defender of women: the allocation of $500 million in federal funding for breast cancer research and the mandated inclusion of women and minorities in all federal health trials. She co-authored the 1994 Violence Against Women Act, which offered legal avenues to women who were victims of crime.Slaughter was part of the group of seven Democratic congressional women who in 1991 marched up the steps of the U.S. Capitol, attempting to delay the confirmation process for then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas. They were unsuccessful in demanding the male leaders of the Senate to fully investigate Anita Hill’s sexual harassment allegations against Thomas.“There’s no monolithic way that women respond to this. But we are the people who write the laws of the land. Good Lord, she should have some recourse here,” Slaughter said at the time, according to The New York Times.In 1996, she was one of only a handful of Democrats who voted against the Defense of Marriage Act, which the Supreme Court struck down in 2013, paving the way for LGBTQ couples to legally marry.She marked her time as the first female chairwoman of the House Rules Committee from 2007 to 2011 by playing a role in passing other historic legislation, including the Affordable Care Act, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 and the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act. Slaughter was a co-chair and founding member of the Congressional Pro-Choice Caucus.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) commemorated Slaughter as “a trailblazer.”“Her strong example inspired countless young women to know their power, and seek their rightful place at the head of the decision-making table,” she said in a statement on Friday.Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas), who currently chairs the Rules Committee, remembered Slaughter as “a fearless leader, deeply committed to her constituents, and a dear friend.”“As the first female Chairwoman of our Committee, she was a force to be reckoned with, who always brought her spunk, fire, and dynamic leadership to every meeting,” Sessions said in a statement. “Although we sat on different sides of the aisle, I have always considered her a partner and have the utmost respect for her.”Slaughter was married to husband Bob Slaughter for 57 years, until his death in 2014, according to her office. She is survived by three daughters, seven grandchildren, and one great-grandchild. This story has been updated with statements from Pelosi and Sessions."

The programs aim to prevent young people from behaving dangerously, whether that means bullying, using drugs or killing someone.Coffman said that Safe2Tell has saved lives in Colorado, and that such a system could have prevented the Parkland shooting. Nikolas Cruz, the expelled student who has admitted to shooting his former classmates at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, had a long record of disturbing behavior but it didn’t provoke a sufficient response from local authorities. A tipster’s warning to an FBI hotline was never communicated to local law enforcement.Tips that are sent to Safe2Tell, in contrast, are required to be passed on to school districts and often police departments, and local officials are required to investigate. That might mean setting up a meeting between a student and a school counselor, or it might mean sending a police car straight to a student’s home.“Something like Safe2Tell would have led to an intervention,” Coffman said of the shooting in Florida. “I feel very confident saying that.”Tip lines, which are relatively inexpensive and don’t affect gun control laws, are one of the few policy responses to mass shootings that Republicans and Democrats can agree on.Colorado launched Safe2Tell after Columbine in 1999. Since 2014, Michigan, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Wyoming have launched similar programs, prompted in part by the Sandy Hook massacre in 2012.In the wake of the Parkland massacre, the Colorado Safe2Tell office has fielded calls from the Trump administration and interested state and local officials nationwide. “We’re getting calls from all over the country now, it’s crazy,” said Susan Payne, the director of Safe2Tell.The Colorado Attorney General’s Office is working with its Florida counterpart to potentially set up a tip line there. In Arizona, a bill setting up a similar program is making its way through House and Senate committees. And this week the U.S. House passed legislation that would authorize grants for such programs along with other school safety initiatives.“Solutions on the state level — including in my home state of Utah — can help show us the way forward,” Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch said in a speech last month announcing the school safety legislation. Utah’s anonymous tip line has investigated 86 credible school attack threats since it launched in 2016, according to University of Utah Health, the health care system that manages the program.A Response to ColumbinePayne came up with the idea for Safe2Tell in the 1990s when she was working as a police detective in Colorado Springs. At the time, youth violence was rising locally, and she found that young people often had valuable information about what was going to happen and needed trusted adults to tell — and a reliable way to do it.She envisioned a system that would teach children that speaking up was their civic responsibility and doing so didn’t make them a tattletale. Unlike the national tip line Crime Stoppers, there would be no cash reward for providing information. Safe2Tell expanded statewide in Colorado in 2004, initially as a nonprofit.Today, Colorado state patrol officers respond to tips that reach Safe2Tell by phone, mobile app or website 24/7, and ask tipsters detailed questions to gather information about a potential problem. Alerts are sent out to local officials soon after the interview ends.John McDonald, head of security for Jefferson County Public Schools, said he’s been woken in the wee hours by his phone buzzing with an incoming alert. Often, he said, young people submit their reports when they’re up late worrying about something.He has responded to tips about everything from suicidal thoughts to underage keg parties. Sometimes, tips lead to dramatic rescues. He and Coffman both shared the story of a middle-school-aged boy who tried to hang himself in a park. The boy’s teenage brother found him and saved his life after a principal received a tip and called the family in alarm.Payne says that non-emergency reports are important, too. For instance, a report that a child has been cruel to animals can help a school district intervene and address his violent tendencies early on.Last school year, more than 9,000 tips were submitted statewide. The most common tip involved a suicide threat. Other common tips involved bullying, drug use, cutting and depression, and about 300 involved planned school attacks. Anyone can use the service, including parents, teachers, college students and other community members.Social media has made it easier than ever for users to spot and share safety threats. Sometimes tipsters will share pictures students have posted online of themselves wearing body armor and posing with a gun.To make sure the program is being used, Safe2Tell officials team up with schools and nonprofits to educate students about it. “Just a tip line, by itself, I don’t think is the answer,” Payne said. Not a Magic SolutionYet some acts of violence have slipped through the cracks. In 2013, a student entered a Denver-area high school armed with a shotgun, a hunting knife and three Molotov cocktails. He shot a classmate in the head and then shot himself. Both teenagers died.Although several students had had concerns about the student’s violent tendencies, nobody called the state tip line. “If just one student or teacher had called Safe2Tell, this tragedy might have been averted,” a report from researchers at the University of Colorado at Boulder and the University of Northern Colorado said about the shooting.The researchers found that, among other mistakes, the high school never properly taught students and staff about Safe2Tell. The program was advertised on posters in the hallways, and stickers on the back of student identification badges, but students had not been trained to use it.School districts need a system for keeping track of and addressing worrisome behavior way before a student reaches a crisis point, said William Woodward, one of the report authors and director of training and technical assistance at the Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence at the University of Colorado. The center is working with Colorado schools to improve intervention.And schools also need the resources to follow up. Nevada, for instance, hired more school social workers before it launched a tip line this year. “We didn’t want tips to come in, and nobody ready to respond,” said Christina McGill, director of the office for a safe and respectful learning environment at the Nevada Department of Education.“I will kid you not: It is labor intensive,” McDonald said of the Safe2Tell program. Tips can come in at any time of day and might involve a coordinated response from school administration and the police. “You’re waking up a lot of people,” he said.Coffman said that policymakers and school officials in other states have told her that they’re worried some schools may not have the capacity to adequately respond to a high volume of tips.The number of tips submitted in Colorado have increased dramatically over the past decade, which Coffman attributes partly to rising awareness of the program and partly to rising incidence of mental illness among young people in Colorado and nationwide. “I think that is an undercurrent through all these statistics,” she said.States that want to set up a program similar to Safe2Tell should start with legislation that guarantees anonymity for tipsters, Payne said, and they can reach out to Colorado for advice. Safe2Tell cost less than $600,000 to run last year, she estimated.Payne said she has encouraged the White House to establish a national umbrella to oversee all the state programs, as tips can come in to Colorado’s system that affect other states, and vice versa.Although the White House has not commented on the umbrella organization idea, President Donald Trump supports school safety legislation passed by the House this week, according to spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders.Stateline home pageSign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research "

Since 2014, Michigan, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Wyoming have launched similar programs, prompted in part by the Sandy Hook massacre in 2012.In the wake of the Parkland massacre, the Colorado Safe2Tell office has fielded calls from the Trump administration and interested state and local officials nationwide. “We’re getting calls from all over the country now, it’s crazy,” said Susan Payne, the director of Safe2Tell.The Colorado Attorney General’s Office is working with its Florida counterpart to potentially set up a tip line there. In Arizona, a bill setting up a similar program is making its way through House and Senate committees. And this week the U.S. House passed legislation that would authorize grants for such programs along with other school safety initiatives.“Solutions on the state level — including in my home state of Utah — can help show us the way forward,” Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch said in a speech last month announcing the school safety legislation. Utah’s anonymous tip line has investigated 86 credible school attack threats since it launched in 2016, according to University of Utah Health, the health care system that manages the program.A Response to ColumbinePayne came up with the idea for Safe2Tell in the 1990s when she was working as a police detective in Colorado Springs. At the time, youth violence was rising locally, and she found that young people often had valuable information about what was going to happen and needed trusted adults to tell — and a reliable way to do it.She envisioned a system that would teach children that speaking up was their civic responsibility and doing so didn’t make them a tattletale. Unlike the national tip line Crime Stoppers, there would be no cash reward for providing information. Safe2Tell expanded statewide in Colorado in 2004, initially as a nonprofit.Today, Colorado state patrol officers respond to tips that reach Safe2Tell by phone, mobile app or website 24/7, and ask tipsters detailed questions to gather information about a potential problem. Alerts are sent out to local officials soon after the interview ends.John McDonald, head of security for Jefferson County Public Schools, said he’s been woken in the wee hours by his phone buzzing with an incoming alert. Often, he said, young people submit their reports when they’re up late worrying about something.He has responded to tips about everything from suicidal thoughts to underage keg parties. Sometimes, tips lead to dramatic rescues. He and Coffman both shared the story of a middle-school-aged boy who tried to hang himself in a park. The boy’s teenage brother found him and saved his life after a principal received a tip and called the family in alarm.Payne says that non-emergency reports are important, too. For instance, a report that a child has been cruel to animals can help a school district intervene and address his violent tendencies early on.Last school year, more than 9,000 tips were submitted statewide. The most common tip involved a suicide threat. Other common tips involved bullying, drug use, cutting and depression, and about 300 involved planned school attacks. Anyone can use the service, including parents, teachers, college students and other community members.Social media has made it easier than ever for users to spot and share safety threats. Sometimes tipsters will share pictures students have posted online of themselves wearing body armor and posing with a gun.To make sure the program is being used, Safe2Tell officials team up with schools and nonprofits to educate students about it. “Just a tip line, by itself, I don’t think is the answer,” Payne said. Not a Magic SolutionYet some acts of violence have slipped through the cracks. In 2013, a student entered a Denver-area high school armed with a shotgun, a hunting knife and three Molotov cocktails. He shot a classmate in the head and then shot himself. Both teenagers died.Although several students had had concerns about the student’s violent tendencies, nobody called the state tip line. “If just one student or teacher had called Safe2Tell, this tragedy might have been averted,” a report from researchers at the University of Colorado at Boulder and the University of Northern Colorado said about the shooting.The researchers found that, among other mistakes, the high school never properly taught students and staff about Safe2Tell. The program was advertised on posters in the hallways, and stickers on the back of student identification badges, but students had not been trained to use it.School districts need a system for keeping track of and addressing worrisome behavior way before a student reaches a crisis point, said William Woodward, one of the report authors and director of training and technical assistance at the Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence at the University of Colorado. The center is working with Colorado schools to improve intervention.And schools also need the resources to follow up. Nevada, for instance, hired more school social workers before it launched a tip line this year. “We didn’t want tips to come in, and nobody ready to respond,” said Christina McGill, director of the office for a safe and respectful learning environment at the Nevada Department of Education.“I will kid you not: It is labor intensive,” McDonald said of the Safe2Tell program. Tips can come in at any time of day and might involve a coordinated response from school administration and the police. “You’re waking up a lot of people,” he said.Coffman said that policymakers and school officials in other states have told her that they’re worried some schools may not have the capacity to adequately respond to a high volume of tips.The number of tips submitted in Colorado have increased dramatically over the past decade, which Coffman attributes partly to rising awareness of the program and partly to rising incidence of mental illness among young people in Colorado and nationwide. “I think that is an undercurrent through all these statistics,” she said.States that want to set up a program similar to Safe2Tell should start with legislation that guarantees anonymity for tipsters, Payne said, and they can reach out to Colorado for advice. Safe2Tell cost less than $600,000 to run last year, she estimated.Payne said she has encouraged the White House to establish a national umbrella to oversee all the state programs, as tips can come in to Colorado’s system that affect other states, and vice versa.Although the White House has not commented on the umbrella organization idea, President Donald Trump supports school safety legislation passed by the House this week, according to spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders.Stateline home pageSign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research "

Mike Conaway, a Republican from Texas, has to figure out whether to write a bipartisan food stamp bill or one that gets only Republican support.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aabc3b61e000008087aee66.jpeg?ops=crop_30_191_3970_2096%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― A Republican plan to shrink food stamp enrollment is in some serious trouble.Earlier this week House Agriculture Committee chairman Mike Conaway (R-Texas), the Republican in charge of writing new food stamp legislation, postponed releasing his bill in order to win Democratic support first. But on Thursday Democrats abandoned the negotiation. “The Democratic members have made clear that they unanimously oppose [Conaway’s proposal] as it has been described to them and reported in the press,” Rep. Collin Peterson (D-Minn.), the top Democrat on the committee, said Thursday evening.Conaway has to figure out whether he wants to write a bipartisan bill or one that would pass the House with just Republicans. But since Republicans don’t have a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, it’s hard to see how a Republican-only strategy could succeed. Nevertheless, an influential group of hardline House conservatives has been telling Conaway and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) that if they’re not ready to severely shrink enrollment with the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, then they should wait until after midterm elections in November.“I’m focused on real welfare reform, including food stamp reform, and if that’s not in the legislation then I’ve said before I think it should be a short-term extension,” Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), founder of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, told HuffPost on Thursday.Roughly 42 million Americans receive food benefits from the program, which is one of the federal government’s most important safety nets and one that experts have credited for eliminating starvation in the U.S. Monthly benefits average $125 per person.Republicans say having extra money for food discourages people from working, though recent research shows most adults who receive SNAP benefits participate in the labor force.The Trump administration has made a lot of noise about food stamps this year, saying it favored replacing benefits with boxes of canned goods. The administration is closely allied with the Freedom Caucus leaders, who have been badmouthing an investigation into Trump’s presidential campaign.Peterson said in a radio interview last week that Conaway’s plan would deny benefits to 8 million people. A Conaway spokeswoman said the number was not accurate but declined to provide details. Enrollment in the program has been declining for years, and budget forecasters already expect improved economic conditions to result in 8 million fewer people receiving monthly benefits a decade from now. Jordan said he hadn’t seen Conaway’s bill, but that if it kicked an extra 8 million people off food stamps, “that certainly sounds like it’s moving in the right direction.”The Agriculture Committee traditionally produces a farm bill every five years reauthorizing agribusiness subsidies and nutrition assistance. The previous farm bill bogged down in 2013 under similar circumstances, with hardline conservatives balking at a bipartisan measure that didn’t cut benefits as much as they would have liked. So the House passed a more conservative bill that ultimately got smothered in a House-Senate conference committee.  Citing his own conversations with Senate Agriculture Committee chairman Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), Peterson said last week that “the Senate’s not going to do any of this stuff, so this has been an exercise in futility.”Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) told HuffPost that delaying the farm bill would be good because “anything trying to happen before the midterms is difficult.” The idea that Republicans could get a better deal if they wait until after November doesn’t make much sense to Rep. Frank Lucas (R-Okla.), who chaired the Agriculture Committee when hardliners blew up his farm bill five years ago. After all, if Democrats win enough seats to retake the House, they’ll be in charge of the farm bill. “What happens if we are not in control then a year from now?” Lucas told HuffPost. “Then the document becomes totally different. What’s that old line? Cut off your nose to spite your face?”"

The eponymous New Gods are “natives of the twin planets of New Genesis and Apokolips,” according to Variety. The magazine describes New Genesis as “an idyllic planet ruled by the Highfather” and Apokolips as “a dystopia filled with machinery and fire pits ruled by the tyrant Darkseid.”DuVernay most recently directed the fantasy film “A Wrinkle in Time,” starring Oprah, Reese Witherspoon, Mindy Kaling and others. Her work on that movie made her the first woman of color in Hollywood to direct a live-action film with a production budget of at least $100 million. She was also director of the historical drama “Selma” and the Oscar-nominated documentary “13th.”Last year’s blockbuster success “Wonder Woman” marked the first time a woman ― in that case, Patty Jenkins ― had helmed a superhero film in the DC Universe. So it only makes sense that DC would hire a powerhouse like DuVernay to follow suit.Jenkins even tweeted at DuVernay to thank her for “A Wrinkle in Time,” and the two exchanged kind words. DuVernay said she looked forward to seeing Jenkins “around the block.”As for DuVernay’s possible comic book prowess, she’s already proven she’s a fan ― particularly of New Gods. She tweeted last year that Big Barda, a New God, was her favorite superhero character: All hail Queen Ava.To read more of HuffPost’s Women’s History Month coverage, head here, or follow along with HuffPost on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

That figure ― and the damage behind it ― will increase as the temperature rises.“Natural disasters have caused a record-setting amount of damage in the U.S.,” said Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) in response to the 2017 figures when they were released in January. “There’s no denying that climate change will cost the U.S. trillions more in the next decade and that we have a financial and national security reason to act.”FEMA Public Affairs director William Booher defended the puzzling exclusion in an email to NPR, emphasizing the agency focuses less on causes and more on mitigating their effects.“It is evident that this strategic plan fully incorporates future risks from all hazards regardless of cause,” Booher wrote. “Building upon the foundation established by FEMA’s previous two Strategic Plans, this plan commits the agency, and the nation, to taking proactive steps to increasing pre-disaster investments in preparedness and mitigation.” In contrast, FEMA’s 2014-2018 Strategic Plan named climate change as a prime contributor to increasing disaster risk ― and it urged we take action.“Scientific evidence indicates that the climate is changing and significant economic, social, and environmental consequences can be expected as a result,” the previous document warned. “A changing climate is already resulting in quantifiable changes to the risks communities face, showing that future risks are not the same as those faced in the past. The emergency management community will need to adapt appropriately to these changing risks as they strengthen their risk management programs.”"

Trump insisted to donors in Missouri on Wednesday that a U.S. automaker had spent a “fortune” building a super car to beat Japanese regulatory tests — but was pounded in the “bowling ball test,” according to an audiotape of his talk obtained by NBC News and The Washington Post.“It’s horrible the way they treat us. It’s horrible,” the angry president griped.The test, he said, involves dropping a bowling ball “from 20 feet up in the air” onto the hood of a car. “If the hood dents, then the car doesn’t qualify,” he said. “Well, guess what, the roof dented a little bit, and they said, nope, this car doesn’t qualify.”There is no such regulatory test. The best guess on what Trump was talking about?The Post speculated it was likely linked to a goofy Nissan ad showing bowling balls bouncing wildly down a street. The balls smash several parked cars. Only a Nissan cruises by unscathed ... “urban proof.”When a smiling reporter who covered the Japanese auto industry for 25 years told White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders that no one has any idea what the president was talking about, she said Trump clearly was “joking.”“Obviously, he’s joking about this particular test,” Sanders said. Trump’s reference “illustrates the creative ways” countries keep American goods out of their markets, she said.The donor talk in Missouri was the same place where Trump boasted that he dressed down Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for having a trade surplus with the U.S. (The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative actually reports a trade deficit with America).“I didn’t even know,” Trump told his audience. “I had no idea.”"

Had I been on set or known about this, I would have made all efforts to stop this. I’ve called the producers to express my outrage.” PETA says the video was shot in November and shows a cage containing a dog suspended from a crane. Several individuals appear to be holding the cage back with a rope before they suddenly release it. The cage spins wildly in the air, falls into a river, and is submerged for a few seconds before it’s raised back into the air.PETA told HuffPost that the footage that was being filmed was for a scene in which an alien picks up the dog and tosses it around. HuffPost reached out to the film’s production company, Dirty Monkey Films Group, but did not immediately receive a response.PETA says the whistleblower reported that there were multiple takes of this scene, and another scene where a handler “tormented the dog ‘into a frenzy’” over a two-hour time period. The dog allegedly never received breaks.“PETA is urging the actors to hold the production accountable and calling for the public to boycott this film,” the organization said in a statement. “This scene should be cut, and [director Ning Hao] should commit to never working with live animals again. We’re asking that the cast — including ‘Glee’ actor Matthew Morrison — donate their salaries to animal-protection charities in China.”A similar controversy arose over the film “A Dog’s Purpose” last year, when footage from the set suggested a German shepherd was forced to swim against its will. Animal trainers and the film’s producer said the footage was misleading and that the dog was unharmed. "
56,WORLD NEWS,Mexico’s Sex Trafficking Laws Are Hurting The People They’re Supposed To Protect,Katie Schlechter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mexico-lgbt-sex-workers-trafficking_us_5aabfbaee4b0337adf8382ed,The country's law has become a tool to prosecute rather than protect sex workers.,2018-03-16,"Fanny Romero, a sex worker in southern Mexico, allows acquaintances to rent out her apartment when they have no other place to meet clients.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aac02c12000007d06eb2291.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"TUXTLA GUTIÉRREZ, MEXICO — Sitting at the kitchen table in her friend’s apartment, Fanny Romero flicked her fingers across the screen of her smartphone, scrolling through seemingly endless WhatsApp messages from men inquiring about her availability for the night.Huddled up to her, Anyela Zuniga scrutinized the names flying by on the screen. “Ugh, I blocked that guy, too. He gave me the creeps,” she told her friend, pointing at one name as the scrolling came to a halt.Both transgender women, Romero and Zuniga are sex workers in the city of Tuxtla Gutiérrez, the humid capital of Mexico’s southern state of Chiapas. They work for themselves, communicating with clients through Facebook and WhatsApp and deciding their own hours and rates. Their occupation involves many risks and challenges ― the biggest of them all simply staying safe while on the job. In 2012, Mexico passed a law to combat human trafficking. Yet sex workers and their advocates say that the legislation actually hurts the people it’s intended to protect, pushing an already stigmatized profession deeper into the shadows and making people working in the country’s sex industry more vulnerable to violence and disease.“It’s very difficult because you see that in the streets we are exposed,” Romero said from her kitchen table. “We are exposed to the possibility that a psychopath arrives and hires you, takes you to a motel, and you don’t know what kind of feelings he may have toward you.”To have someone close in case anything goes wrong, Romero and Zuniga work out of their homes ― for Zuniga that’s the apartment she shares with two roommates, for Romero the apartment where she lives with her two chihuahuas. Romero also rents out her home to friends and acquaintances who don’t have a safe space to meet with their clients. That, however, puts her at risk of arrest, prosecution and imprisonment for up to 30 years.When Romero rents out a room to fellow sex workers, she violates multiple articles under Mexico’s 2012 law against human trafficking. Article 20 of the law prohibits obtaining “economic benefit” from the prostitution of another person. Article 41 goes even further: it forbids anyone from facilitating or collaborating with someone to do sex work.The human trafficking law, which was last reformed in 2014, is based on a United Nations protocol created in 2000 that aims to “to prevent and combat trafficking in persons, especially women and children.” But sex workers and their advocates say that in Mexico the legislation is being used to prosecute the women and migrants the laws are supposed to protect.As is the case for many of their colleagues, a complicated mix of circumstances puts Romero and Zuniga at risk of danger and exploitation. Mexico has decriminalized prostitution, but the practice is regulated in less than half of the country’s states, forcing many sex workers to operate in the shadows.Migrant sex workers like Zuniga ― she migrated to Mexico several years ago to escape violence and discrimination in her home country of Honduras ― often lack a local support system and are less likely to know their rights. This makes them vulnerable to human rights violations.Transgender women suffer a third layer of vulnerability. A 2016 University of Toronto Law School report found that Mexico had the second highest number of anti-LGBTQ hate crimes in the Americas. At least 594 LGBTQ individuals (or people perceived as such) were killed in attacks that appeared related to their sexual orientation or gender identity between January 2013 and March 2014, according to the Organization of American States. Half of those victims were transgender women. There are several reasons the anti-trafficking law has become a tool to prosecute rather than protect sex workers, said Vanessa Maldonado, a PhD student in Mexico City who has studied the legislation. She says that the law doesn’t make a clear distinction between trafficking and sex work and therefore doesn’t force authorities to distinguish between voluntary and forced prostitution.One unintended consequence is that during an arrest, police put sex workers into one of two categories: victim or trafficker. If the sex worker admits to prostitution, they’re obliged to name a trafficker. For migrant workers, the dilemma brings heightened concerns, Maldonado said. In addition to sex workers, armed raids on bars and clubs throughout Chiapas have ensnared women employed as waitresses and bartenders, according to Maldonado. Many of those arrested are migrants from Central America. If they don’t reveal a trafficker’s name, they face the threat of deportation or are labeled traffickers themselves. Many see no other option than naming a co-worker as the head of the supposed “operation.” Central American migrants are disproportionately targeted under the anti-trafficking law, Centro Prodh, one of Mexico’s leading human rights organizations said in a 2016 report. When the organization first began researching the situation in 2015, 24 percent of the inmates in the women’s prison outside of Tapachula were held on human trafficking charges. Of that group, 70 percent were migrant women from Central America.The report highlighted the cases of six women ― five Central American migrants and one Mexican ― all of whom local authorities arrested and imprisoned in Chiapas on charges of human trafficking. The Centro Prodh investigation found that prosecutors used illegal evidence in all of their cases, including confessions and accusations acquired through coercion, threats and degrading treatment. Two of the women told the human rights group that they were tricked or forced into signing blank sheets of paper. These signatures later appeared on confessions of guilt.Sex workers and their advocates are not the only critics of how Mexico’s law classifies victims. U.S. Department of State reports show a drastic increase in convictions of alleged traffickers and rescues of victims in Mexico since the passage of the 2012 law. In 2011, before the law was passed, Mexico reported 14 convictions and 89 victims. By 2016, those numbers had shifted to 228 convictions and 740 victims.The increase in arrests and rescues don’t necessarily indicate an increase in the crime of human trafficking. The State Department’s 2017 Trafficking in Persons report indicated that “some public officials misunderstood the legal definition of trafficking and conflated it with migrant smuggling and prostitution.” It also faulted Mexican authorities for orchestrating “anti-trafficking raids for the purpose of detaining individuals in prostitution and irregular migrants.”Local governments have been complicit with real incidents of human trafficking, the 2017 report also suggested. “Despite persistent reports of extensive official complicity, authorities did not report any investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of government employees complicit in trafficking in 2016,” the report reads. “The government has not convicted a complicit official since 2010.”Federal and state officials in Mexico did not respond to repeated requests for comment.In the cases where they do arrest and prosecute someone who is actually involved in human trafficking, it’s typically someone very low down in the operation, said Maureen Meyer, director for Mexico and migrant rights at the research and human rights advocacy organization, the Washington Office on Latin America.“There certainly doesn’t seem to be as much investigative capacity or focus on going after leaders of trafficking networks,” she added.This is similar to what Maldonado has seen in Chiapas. She does not see the raids as effective for catching actual criminals. “Human trafficking still thrives,” she said. “What they are actually doing is going after sex workers, going after undocumented migrants and allowing real human trafficking to continue.”Romero and Zuniga continue trying to make their livings as safely as possible without being ensnared by the laws that are supposed to protect them. It’s a fine line to walk. “Perhaps in the moment they see it as easy money,” Romero said. “But we are risking our lives more than everything, and you can’t buy life or bring it back.”This project was made possible by a fellowship from the French-American Foundation - United States.

57,WORLD NEWS,Mexico’s Sex Trafficking Laws Are Hurting The People They’re Supposed To Protect,Katie Schlechter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mexico-lgbt-sex-workers-trafficking_us_5aabfbaee4b0337adf8382ed,The country's law has become a tool to prosecute rather than protect sex workers.,2018-03-16,Zuniga and Romero use their smartphones to arrange meetings with potential clients.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aac032b1e0000fb077aeef3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"TUXTLA GUTIÉRREZ, MEXICO — Sitting at the kitchen table in her friend’s apartment, Fanny Romero flicked her fingers across the screen of her smartphone, scrolling through seemingly endless WhatsApp messages from men inquiring about her availability for the night.Huddled up to her, Anyela Zuniga scrutinized the names flying by on the screen. “Ugh, I blocked that guy, too. He gave me the creeps,” she told her friend, pointing at one name as the scrolling came to a halt.Both transgender women, Romero and Zuniga are sex workers in the city of Tuxtla Gutiérrez, the humid capital of Mexico’s southern state of Chiapas. They work for themselves, communicating with clients through Facebook and WhatsApp and deciding their own hours and rates. Their occupation involves many risks and challenges ― the biggest of them all simply staying safe while on the job. In 2012, Mexico passed a law to combat human trafficking. Yet sex workers and their advocates say that the legislation actually hurts the people it’s intended to protect, pushing an already stigmatized profession deeper into the shadows and making people working in the country’s sex industry more vulnerable to violence and disease.“It’s very difficult because you see that in the streets we are exposed,” Romero said from her kitchen table. “We are exposed to the possibility that a psychopath arrives and hires you, takes you to a motel, and you don’t know what kind of feelings he may have toward you.”To have someone close in case anything goes wrong, Romero and Zuniga work out of their homes ― for Zuniga that’s the apartment she shares with two roommates, for Romero the apartment where she lives with her two chihuahuas. Romero also rents out her home to friends and acquaintances who don’t have a safe space to meet with their clients. That, however, puts her at risk of arrest, prosecution and imprisonment for up to 30 years.When Romero rents out a room to fellow sex workers, she violates multiple articles under Mexico’s 2012 law against human trafficking. Article 20 of the law prohibits obtaining “economic benefit” from the prostitution of another person. Article 41 goes even further: it forbids anyone from facilitating or collaborating with someone to do sex work.The human trafficking law, which was last reformed in 2014, is based on a United Nations protocol created in 2000 that aims to “to prevent and combat trafficking in persons, especially women and children.” But sex workers and their advocates say that in Mexico the legislation is being used to prosecute the women and migrants the laws are supposed to protect.As is the case for many of their colleagues, a complicated mix of circumstances puts Romero and Zuniga at risk of danger and exploitation. Mexico has decriminalized prostitution, but the practice is regulated in less than half of the country’s states, forcing many sex workers to operate in the shadows.Migrant sex workers like Zuniga ― she migrated to Mexico several years ago to escape violence and discrimination in her home country of Honduras ― often lack a local support system and are less likely to know their rights. This makes them vulnerable to human rights violations.Transgender women suffer a third layer of vulnerability.

58,WORLD NEWS,Why The 'Mike Pence Rule' Is Particularly Dangerous In Korea,Jessica Prois,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mike-pence-korea-metoo_us_5aaadd57e4b0337adf8252b1,Avoiding one-on-one time with women in a country with a huge gender wage gap is not progress.,2018-03-16,"South Korean demonstrators hold banners during a rally to mark International Women's Day as part of the country's Me Too movement in Seoul on March 8, 2018.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aaadfca1f00002d0016a84b.jpeg?cache=eYtuYMAtdp&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Kim Hyun-Yoo, Jessica Prois HuffPost Korea/HuffPost U.S.A measure that involves avoiding contact with women as a way to buffer oneself against allegations of abuse has traversed the globe from the U.S. and found its way to South Korea. And apparently, we’re back to 14th-century Chosun Dynasty standards.Searches and posts about the “Mike Pence rule” spread across social platforms and within Korean search portal Naver News last week, with internet users pointing to it as a “countermeasure” to avoid being called out by the Me Too movement.The concept of the “Mike Pence rule,” covered by the Korea Times and other outlets, was a term coined from an interview last year with U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, in which he said that he never eats alone with women other than his wife to avoid accusations of sexual harassment.In Korea, this measure comes with its own brand of reproach. Avoiding one-on-one time with women in a country that already has the largest gender wage gap among Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development nations actually impedes progress. South Korea ranks 118th of 144 in terms of gender equality, and women earn 63 percent of what men earn. To be sure, Korea is a deeply patriarchal society, where men and elders maintain authority and domination, so this power imbalance is entrenched.And now, accusations of wrongdoing against famous politics, lawyers and authors have led to a countermovement to Me Too in Korea. Bank teller Park Won-ji provided an example of the “Pence rule” to the Chosun Ilbo, a major South Korean newspaper, saying that her boss has decided to communicate with his female staff members through text messages rather than in-person.“I feel like I’ve become a criminal in the office. I have done nothing wrong, but men are leaving me out of their gatherings and sometimes treat me as if I am invisible,” Park told the news outlet.There is, of course, a countermeasure to the countermeasure, with many in Korea pointing to arguments that invalidate the “rule,” such as Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg speaking out about how it would be a huge roadblock for equality. She offered the reminder that there is still an imbalance in creating fairness for women since there are far more male executives on a given staff than female.But beyond those workplace dynamics, the presumption of sexual harassment in every interaction characterizes both men and women as lacking agency and also discounts structural issues that impede gender equality. Korean society ― or any society ― won’t prosper this way. When the ideas behind the “Mike Pence rule” began circulating in the U.S., anecdotes included a male surgeon saying he no longer greets a colleague with a hug, detailed in The Washington Post, and issues with canceling one-on-one meetings on work trips.The Post points out not only does the Pence rule abdicate men of responsibility and cast woman as untrustworthy narrators, it also implies men are motivated strictly by sex. As the Post points out:“Instituting rules that create de facto segregation by gender is a tacit admission that men are inherently unable to control themselves around women. If we follow the logic to its natural end, the inevitable conclusion is that the only line separating a co-worker and a harassment suit is convenience.”Emma Gray, writing for HuffPost, points out men are certainly better than that.In the wake of the allegations of misconduct against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, Gray also noted that workplace mobility is undeniably related to forming the right relationships and establishing proper allies. In Korea, where longstanding traditions can create boys’ club workplaces, and where bonding is often carried out in the form of drinking after hours, women don’t need another obstacle. As Gray pointed out, if men decide to limit their interactions with women, women are the ones left to pick up the pieces of the ensuing disrepute: “Let’s put the onus for professional behavior where it belongs ― on the male power-brokers ― rather than punishing the women who have to deal with their predatory behavior.” To read more of HuffPost’s Women’s History Month coverage head here, or follow along with HuffPost on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.A version of this post originally appeared on HuffPost Korea.

I never thought I’d be rooting for a porn star, I think it’s a more honest way to make a living than what he’s doing,” said one accuser, who asked to stay anonymous because of the threats she received after going public with her story. The outlet noted that the woman has accused Trump of grabbing and kissing her without her consent. Daniels, whose given name is Stephanie Clifford, says she had an affair with Trump starting in 2006, a few months after Melania Trump gave birth to Trump’s youngest son, Barron. Her story received renewed attention in January when it was revealed that Trump’s attorney arranged a $130,000 payment to Daniels before the 2016 election ― an exchange that may be illegal. Trump has denied allegations of an affair and any knowledge of the payment, and Daniels is currently fighting a legal battle to share her full story publicly.Journalist Natasha Stoynoff, who accused Trump of pinning her against a wall and kissing her in 2005, told People that she is also a fan of Daniels. “Let’s just say that all week I’ve been envisioning her as Time’s ‘Person of the Year’ come December,” Stoynoff said of Daniels, adding that she’s definitely cheering on the porn star and accomplished equestrian. Trump has been accused by 21 women of sexual misconduct, including harassment, assault and rape. The president has categorically denied all allegations and called them “fake news.”“She’s got a lot of guts and like many women, I trust she’s had enough of his lies. Here’s hoping she puts an end to them once and for all for the sake of country,” Stoynoff said.She added, “From what I’ve seen so far, I like her.” Jessica Leeds, who says Trump groped her on a plane in the 1980s, is not as sold on Daniels and the possible effect her story could have. “His supporters don’t care,” Leeds said. “They knew all along and accepted the fact. I don’t think it will change anyone’s opinion, even if she wins her suit.”Read more at People."

Regardless of how the movie fares with critics and audiences, it represents a more personal milestone for actor Keiynan Lonsdale. Lonsdale plays Bram Greenfeld, a high school soccer jock and one of several possible swoonworthy love interests for the film’s closeted protagonist, Simon Spier (Nick Robinson). Prior to being cast in the role, the actor had never spoken publicly about his sexuality. At the movie’s wrap party in Atlanta last year, he came out as bisexual.“Timing is a very funny thing. I never imagined, especially as I was going through my own issues, that I would get to play this character in a queer love story,” the 26-year-old told HuffPost. The film, which hits theaters Friday, “gave me a kick to reflect and think about how I wanted to deal with my internalized shame,” he added. Unlike some of his cast mates, the Aussie-born actor worked with director Greg Berlanti previously on the CW series “The Flash.” Lonsdale said witnessing Berlanti interact with his now-husband, Robbie Rogers, and the couple’s son, Caleb, on the “Love, Simon” set convinced him that the time was right to live authentically. “I realized, ‘Wow, all the circumstances here are so perfect.’ Here’s a gay director with his family on set, I’m playing this character in a gay love story, and everyone is so supportive and accepting,” he said. “Yet here I am, with so much fear. I’m the only one who’s holding me back at this point.”He continued, “The characters in the film were growing more than I was. I was like, ‘Damn! These are high school kids, and I’m not completely brave enough yet.’” (It should be noted that both Lonsdale’s co-star Joey Pollari and Robinson’s real-life brother were inspired by the film to come out publicly.)Shortly after opening up about his sexuality to his “Love, Simon” cast mates, Lonsdale relayed the news to his fans in a powerful Instagram post in May. “I like to take risks with how I dress,” he wrote in the post, which currently has more than 89,000 likes. “I like girls and I like guys (yes), I like growing, I like learning, I like who I am and I really like who I’m becoming.” Since then, the actor said, he’s received “genuine support and love” from young LGBTQ people, some of whom may still be coming to terms with their sexuality. It’s something he doesn’t take for granted, especially given the rampant biphobia that exists within the queer community. Lonsdale, who is half-Nigerian, would like audiences to witness Bram’s on-screen journey to acceptance in “Love, Simon” with similar enthusiasm. The actor believes seeing a black actor or entertainer “who was open and proud of who he was” would’ve had a huge impact on him as a closeted teen and aspiring performer.What much of Lonsdale’s newfound “Love, Simon” fan base may not realize is that he began his career as a singer and a dancer. He released a hip-hop single, “Good Life,” last year, and is currently at work on a full-length album. Meanwhile, he’s continuing to build his TV résumé, and will join the CW’s “Legends of Tomorrow” as a series regular this year.Moving forward, Lonsdale said his only mission is to “be honest about my own journey.”“All I can do is be exactly me,” he said, “and hope that connects with people that are wanting to be exactly them.”“Love Simon” is in theaters Friday."

Dan Lipinski’s (Ill.) seat in Congress, as the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List pours money into helping the right-leaning incumbent defeat his progressive challenger, Marie Newman. SBA List, a political action committee that normally works to elect anti-abortion Republicans, made the unusual move of endorsing Lipinski this week and spending six figures on ads for his campaign ahead of Tuesday’s primary. SBA’s president, Marjorie Dannenfelser, called Lipinski “a hero to the pro-life movement” because he opposes a woman’s right to choose abortion and even some forms of birth control. She said the group is trying to save one of its last remaining allies in the Democratic Party. “They are draining the party dry of any pro-life sentiment,” Dannenfelser told McClatchy. “There’s no tolerance for even pro-choice candidates who think late-term abortion is a bridge too far. No toleration for pro-choicers who think being pro-choice is consistent with being against late-term abortion.”Lipinski is facing a fierce primary challenge from Newman, a progressive businesswoman who is backed by the powerful abortion rights groups EMILY’s List and NARAL as well as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).Newman challenged Lipinski on reproductive rights in a side-by-side interview set to air Friday evening on Fox 32 in Chicago. Lipinski defended his vote against the Affordable Care Act in 2010, explaining that he opposed the provision requiring religious groups to cover birth control in their health care plans. “I don’t think the Little Sisters of the Poor should be forced to provide abortion-inducing drugs, things that go against their beliefs,” Lipinski said.“It’s called birth control, Mr. Lipinski,” Newman responded.Lipinski also opposes LGBTQ rights, the $15-per-hour minimum wage and the Dream Act, and he refused to endorse Obama for president in 2012. The Blue Dog Democrat considers himself a moderate and has characterized Newman as belonging to the “tea party of the left” ― too liberal for his southwest Chicago district. Newman shot back in the Fox 32 interview. “No one knows about this, what is it, tea party of the left? No one’s ever heard of this thing, except for him,” she said. “So the party is actually getting back to its roots for working families and the expanding middle class and bringing health care for all.”"

What’s happening?’ And I try really hard not to see myself online, but she was a little unavoidable.”She added that she doesn’t have the slightest memory of the moment in question and now, of course, deeply regrets that it ever happened. “I have no control over this. What am I doing? … We’re standing! I don’t know, what’s wrong with me?” Garner said. “I wish I did [know]. I wish I had a better story about it.”“I regret, regret, regret,” she added. “I want to just punch her in the face!”Later in the show, the mother of three also addressed another unexpectedly viral social media post ― the one where she burst in tears about “Hamilton” while high on laughing gas at the dentist’s office. “It was a good time for everyone, as far as I can tell,” Garner said while recounting the conversation with her dentist. “Hamilton really is that beautiful. I was listening because I didn’t want to hear the drill and I was crying, weeping during the procedure. And he was like, ‘Are you okay?’”“Love, Simon” hits theaters on Friday. "

The reality competition series has produced a roster of megawatt stars since it premiered nearly a decade ago, but with her blend of self-deprecation and life-sized doll aesthetics, Mattel is also one of the most successful: She’s now topping iTunes charts with her folk music album “One Stone” and stars on Viceland’s weekly “The Trixie and Katya Show.”The 28-year-old performer might have the best post-“Drag Race” track record around, but her journey on “All Stars” Season 3 hasn’t been without its ups and downs.After front-runner BenDeLaCreme removed herself from the race mere episodes shy from the finale, the crown was anyone’s for the taking. When a jury of the eliminated queens decided the fates of the final two, unexpectedly striking out the fan favorite Shangela and first season queen Bebe Zahara Benet, Mattel went on to best fellow Season 7 queen Kennedy Davenport in a powerhouse final lip-sync to Miley Cyrus’ “Wrecking Ball.” Both Mattel and Davenport struggled at points during the competition, unlike the previous season’s winner, Alaska Thunderfuck, who was pegged to slay the game before the first episode even aired. Mattel’s win arrives at a time when the “Drag Race” plates are shifting, as its legion of fans are questioning if the twists-for-twists-sake format is robbing some of the most talented queens of a victory. She’s also the third white drag queen ― Mattel is half Native American but refers to herself as a “boring white dude” ― to enter into the hall of fame, causing an uproar after the episode aired on social media. We caught up with Mattel after her win and, oh, honey, did she spill about everything, including her post-“All Stars” plans, the reception to the finale and what she plans to do with the prize money. Your journey on “Drag Race” has been tumultuous in the best way, and it feels long overdue for you to go out on a high note. Did you ever expect to be an all star, and what’s your headspace like after the finale? I’ve always played the game in my career as if this will never happen. I’m happy it happened, but I definitely didn’t ever count on it or bank on it. Both times previously I lost on “Drag Race,” so I’ve only been a winner for like 12 hours. I think if you’re a real all star, you go out and you’re an all star whether or not you never do “Drag Race” again. I envision myself quitting drag some day and being able to say I won the Olympics of drag. That’s cool, but you can be a really strong athlete and not necessarily win the Olympics. I hate to say I feel almost the same, but I just feel really lucky. Shangela, Bebe and Kennedy were so good, and it literally could’ve been any of us. “The Trixie & Katya Show” is already a success, and your album is topping the charts. What’s next for you? Well, I’m currently nominated for a James Beard Foundation Award, a major culinary arts award, which is hilarious, so I would like to win this major food award. My album came out yesterday, and I hope people hear it and love it. I’m doing 40-plus cities of a United States tour of my show “Moving Parts,” so people will be able to come see me play my guitar and tell jokes in real life. I’ll be writing a new show this summer. The wheels keep turning. “Drag Race” is really cool, but I’ve always got the next 10 monopoly moves ready. Do you feel like you need to defend your success in the competition given that some of the top competitors were knocked out of the race before the final lip-sync? The people who should have to defend that are the people who pulled the lipsticks, you know what I mean? You saw me in the interview. I really thought Shangela and I were going to be lip-syncing, so I was as shocked as anybody else. I have huge respect for her, and I think she’s such a superstar given her track record. I’m an optimistic realist. I kind of expect the worst but prepare for the best.There have been conversations about the rules of “Drag Race” and how the endless twists are negatively impacting the show. As a competitor but also a major fan, do you think the show should return to the strict merit-based elimination criteria? I don’t think so. As much as people might not always agree with the choices made, it’s fun to watch. On a normal season, when people are in the bottom and there’s a lip-sync for your life, people also often disagree about who wins the lip-sync. When they announced that the people choosing were going to be judges, in a certain light maybe that’s more fair because these people were in the workroom and behind the scenes at all times. Who better to make the call than people who were in the Snatch Game with you or learning the choreography next to you? They know how hard everything was, and they know who struggled. In a weird way, they have a lot of insight the judges can’t offer. You turned a corner about halfway through the competition. What was that like to embrace your creativity after being in the bottom and go for broke the rest of the season? Once I was in the bottom and Shangela had basically psychologically cat-and-moused me emotionally and spiritually, I had already accepted that I was going home. When I didn’t, it was kind of like when they pull the mask off the killer. I was like, “Oh, this isn’t a ghost. This is ‘Scooby Doo,’ and this is a janitor.” I kind of realized if I lose it doesn’t make me a bad drag queen, and that’s something I’ve always believed anyway.The fear of losing and the fear of disappointing kind of completely left. I just made bold choices, and that’s it. I was only in the bottom really for Snatch Game, so it was just really one day when I had a bad trip-up. The only other time I was in the bottom was when if you weren’t in the top you were in the bottom. The narrative a little bit was like you haven’t been here or where’s your brain, but I did great in every challenge, and I just fucked up today. But I don’t even think the TV did it justice. I literally probably did the worst Snatch Game in the universe. You are one of the most active queens on social media and engage with conversations about “Drag Race,” which I think have tapped into some very key elements of the show’s legacy. Did you see hashtags like #AllStarsSoWhite, and what’s your reaction to the frustration about a third white queen being crowned an all star? I didn’t even see it. I’ve been avoiding [social media]. I’ll post pictures and videos of myself playing guitar in my room, but I don’t interact or weigh in on topics. As you can see when Shangela confronted me about that note, I can’t really handle confrontation or drama well because I’m never in it, so I don’t really know how to handle it when it comes.I’ve known this day was coming and I’ve known who was in the Top 2. I watched Shangela in the competition, so I knew that it was going to be a surprise. I was watching yesterday, and her heartbreak was obviously upsetting. Watching Bebe have to walk to the back of the stage was upsetting. The Top 4 was three people of color and I’m only, like, half white. Me and Kennedy were the two people in the room that had the least power. We didn’t pull lipsticks. All we did was lip-sync to a beautiful song by Miley Cyrus. What’s the first thing you bought with the prize money? I’m white trash garbage who came from nothing and afraid of living in a car eating cat food at any moment, so I’m just going to save all the money. I know it’s not exciting. I might buy a Nintendo Switch. I live in reality and I know at any moment I could stop getting the phone calls and nobody wants to hear me sing or tell jokes anymore. I just save it all so that one day if I quit drag I have a beautiful nest egg to show for it. Has Katya reached out to you after your win? What was her reaction to her co-host being an official all star?  I haven’t talked to her yet. I’m sure she’s happy. I’m not sure she’s really watching the show right now. I think her journey of health and wellness probably doesn’t leave her a lot of time to watch “Drag Race.” I’m sure whenever she sees it she’ll live. That was my comfort. I was, like, if I lose we are just a couple of losers like the “Wayne’s World” of “Drag Race.” But now I won, so I can look down on her forever. That’s fun. Season 10 starts next week. What advice do you have for the incoming queens?I would say the real race is after “Drag Race.” People like Shangela and I are living proof that you don’t need to have that crown to go be America’s Next Drag Superstar. If they don’t live for your fantasy, you can just go live for your own fantasy. This interview was been edited and condensed for clarity. "

In a statement to the magazine, Cooper said, “Benjamin and I separated as boyfriends some time ago. We are still family to each other, and love each other very much.” He added that the pair “remain the best of friends, and will continue to share much of our lives together.”The couple was photographed together last year at Cooper’s Brazilian vacation home for the July issue of Architectural Digest. In October, Cooper and Maisani spoke with Town & Country magazine about their growing art collection. According to Us Weekly, the pair had been seen together as recently as Saturday, when they attended a benefit for New York City’s The Windward School.In a 2014 interview in the publication French Morning, Maisani, a nightclub owner, spoke of how he avoided the limelight while dating Cooper.“I understand that it interests people, but it doesn’t interest me,” Maisani said of dating a celebrity, according to People. “I knew I’d have to be careful right from the start before it had a chance to get out of hand.”As a result, the pair kept a low-key profile over the years, though there was the occasional Instagram post."

The photo was released on Monday by the Vatican’s communications office, one day before the fifth anniversary of Pope Francis’ election and a few weeks after Francis condemned the spread of fake news as “evil” in a message to journalists.The photo, shown below, is of a Feb. 7 letter from the retired Pope Benedict XVI to the Vatican’s chief of communications, Monsignor Dario Vigano. In the letter, Benedict responds to Vigano’s request that he review a new volume of books about Pope Francis’ theology. But a blurred portion of the letter reveals that Benedict told him he didn’t have time to complete the request.In the part of the letter that is more visible in the photo, Benedict writes that the new book series is evidence of the “foolish prejudice” of Francis’ critics. He adds that the books demonstrate the “interior continuity between the two pontificates, with all the differences in style and temperament.”The letter was reportedly read out in full by Vigano during a news conference. According to AP, Vigano appeared to use it to repudiate Francis’ critics who claim his papal style is a significant departure from that of his predecessor.However, at the very end of the letter, Benedict appears to state that he hasn’t read the entire 11-part book series and, as a result, won’t be able to deliver a sound theological assessment.On Wednesday, the Vatican told AP that it had blurred the final two lines of the first page ― the part where Benedict starts to explain that he didn’t actually read the new book project.

According to Pentin, Benedict tells Vigano that he doesn’t feel like writing a theological assessment on the books because “throughout my life it has always been clear that I would write and express myself only on books I had read really well.”“Unfortunately, if only for physical reasons, I am unable to read the eleven volumes in the near future, especially as other commitments await me that I have already made.”The Associated Press, and most major news media sites, have policies that restrict editors from digitally adding or subtracting from photographs.

At worst, a Hillary Clinton presidency",2016-11-22,<p>Supporters of campaign finance reform protest outside the United States Capitol.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58346c3a1a00002200cc9461.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The 2016 election was a stunning blow to the movement to get big money out of politics. At worst, a Hillary Clinton presidency would have meant a new Supreme Court justice who would vote to overturn Citizens United—the decision that allowed corporations and unions to spend unlimited amounts of money to influence elections. At best, it could have meant a president supporting a constitutional amendment to do even more. The question wasn’t when we would reform our dysfunctional campaign finance system, but how.After the results of Nov. 8, however, the goal of getting big money out of politics seems less attainable than ever. With President-elect Trump and a Republican Congress, our chances of passing federal campaign finance reform in 2016 went from decent to nearly impossible. So what does a wounded movement do now?A Constitutional Amendment Becomes EssentialEven before the 2016 election, I argued that a constitutional amendment to get big money out of politics was preferable to waiting for a re-balanced Supreme Court to do the job for us. Though a court reversal of Citizens United was the more likely outcome, leaving our campaign finance laws in the hands of nine unelected judges had its pitfalls. An amendment offered a permanent solution and the promise of guaranteed reforms, though it would be more difficult to achieve. That made the debate of the Supreme Court path vs. the amendment path worthy of discussion. But that debate doesn’t matter anymore.The 2016 election made the choice for us. Trump’s inevitable Supreme Court nominee will give the court a conservative tilt for the foreseeable future. So, not only is a reversal of Citizens United and other problematic decisions unlikely, but new decisions that give even greater influence to corporations, unions, and ultra-wealthy individuals are probably on their way. A constitutional amendment just became our best option for getting big money out of politics at the federal level. For that to happen, the movement to support an amendment must become more focused and organized than ever before.The State of the MovementSince Citizens United was handed down in 2010, the growing movement for a 28th amendment to overturn the decision has been both fractured and fanciful. Members of Congress and various organizations have already put forth more than a dozen amendment proposals, but most of them fall into one of two undesirable categories: so weak that they don’t actually overturn Citizens United or so extreme that they don’t stand a realistic chance of success. Worse, the glut of amendment proposals has hurt the movement as a whole by creating division among what would ideally be a unified group of activists.State ballot initiatives and vague constitutional convention calls have also confused supporters of the cause. Many people think Citizens United was already reversed by ballot initiatives like recently passed Prop 59 in California or I-735 in Washington that urged legislators to overturn the decision. So far 17 states have passed such initiatives but those “successes” are non-binding so they amount to little more than polite requests that our elected officials give it the old college try.Others believe that we are well on our way to a constitutional convention to pass a 28th amendment because an organization called Wolf Pac has gotten five state legislatures to make the convention call. But those convention calls don’t actually support any concrete amendment proposal and a convention based on Wolf Pac’s vague language could result in many outcomes, good and bad. To make matters worse, by using different language in different states, there is reason to believe those state legislatures have actually called for four separate conventions rather than building momentum for the single convention they want. As a result of so many different proposals and plans, the movement for a 28th amendment is not much further along in 2016 than it was in 2010. The good news is that cohesion is within sight.Uniting Behind the Best Amendment ProposalCitizens Take Action has recently introduced a proposal called the Restore Democracy Amendment along with a comprehensive plan to move it from conception to ratification. The amendment would overturn Citizens United, drastically diminish the power of Super PACs, and because it goes after big money from both corporations and unions, it has bipartisan appeal that other proposals lack. Whether it comes from Congress or the states, any amendment must ultimately be ratified by 38 state legislatures. That means a proposal is dead in the water if it can’t draw support from both Democrats and Republicans.More importantly, by simultaneously seeking supporters through Congress and clear state convention calls, Citizens Take Action’s plan provides the best opportunity for a truly unified movement. The composition of Congress will likely prevent the amendment from passing in the next session. However, there is still value in lining up supporters and identifying opponents now because that will help us clear the path for the amendment’s future success.Going After Opponents The groups working to get big money out of politics may not agree on the same amendment language or approach, but they can all agree that we must have widespread support from elected officials in order to make the amendment a reality. By identifying representatives who oppose the amendment now, we can target vulnerable opponents in the midterm elections and make sure their constituents know who is standing in the way of draining the swamp.Over 70 percent of both Republicans and Democrats support overturning Citizens United so in theory, any elected official who doesn’t should be vulnerable to a worthy challenger. The sooner we put pressure on our representatives through calls and letters, the sooner we can either get them on board with the Restore Democracy Amendment or begin supporting their potential replacements.Committing to “The Impossible”Many prominent legal scholars think that passing a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United is impossible and they may be right. But whether they’re right or wrong, it’s critical for us to find out.If they’re wrong and enough passionate Americans can successfully mobilize and persuade our elected officials to support a 28th amendment, then we need to know that. Constitutional amendments are a powerful tool that every generation except ours has utilized. If we can successfully pass an amendment then not only can we overturn Citizens United, but we can abolish the electoral college, establish Congressional term limits, and do any number of other things that are supported by most Americans, but not by politicians.But if those skeptical scholars are right and an amendment is impossible, we need to know that too. Because if our political system is so broken that we can’t pass an amendment the vast majority of Americans want, or if we are so apathetic that we can’t put down our phones long enough to make it happen, then we’ve got much bigger problems than Citizens United. Maybe instead of one new amendment what we actually need is a brand new constitution. Maybe this country is just too damn big and secession of some states isn’t as crazy as it sounds. Committing to the impossible is the only way to find out what’s actually possible.So, though the 2016 election was a major setback to the movement to get big money out of politics, by limiting our options it may have a galvanizing effect. A constitutional amendment is the only way to overturn Citizens United once and for all. Now it’s our job to make it happen."

The who’s who of TV news included network presidents, such as NBC’s Deborah Turness and ABC’s James Goldston, and high-profile anchors like CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. Attendees at Monday’s meeting declined to comment to reporters afterward, given the off-the-record ground rules. By agreeing to such conditions, journalists expected to deliver the news to the public must withhold details of a newsworthy meeting with the president-elect. But details eventually leaked out. Accounts of the mood at the meeting ranged from extremely tense to cordial, and the president-elect is said to have taken questions and aired his grievances. The New York Post reported that Trump harshly “scolded” the group, including telling CNN chief Jeff Zucker that everyone at the network “is a liar and you should be ashamed.” Politico reported there was talk of having a “productive” relationship yet noted Trump complained to NBC News’ president that the network uses unflattering photos of him. Network anchors have traditionally held off-the-record lunches with the president ahead of the State of the Union address, and President Barack Obama  held several private discussions with leading columnists and commentators.But it’s less common to have both network bosses and top on-air talent meet with a president or, in this case, the president-elect. And it isn’t clear if the networks pushed to get Trump to speak on the record. The media failed to strongly challenge Trump’s unprecedented constraints on the press during the campaign. He hasn’t held a news conference since July. And as president-elect, he has given journalists limited access, including rejecting a “protective pool” of a few rotating reporters who cover his travels. Concerns about the lack of a protective pool came up, a source familiar with the meeting told The Huffington Post.New York Times reporters and editorial columnists will have an opportunity to question Trump on the record when he visits the paper on Tuesday, according to a Times spokesperson. The president-elect will also first meet privately with a small group at the paper, including publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. Trump repeatedly attacked the “failing” Times throughout the 2016 election and threatened multiple lawsuits, but also gave the paper significant access. Although the gathering at the Trump Tower was off the record, the event wasn’t kept a secret. Some of the most prominent figures in business began parading through the building ahead of a 1 p.m. meeting (as seen on C-SPAN’s camera located in the building’s lobby). Here are the rest of the attendees:ABC News: “Good Morning America” co-host George Stephanopoulos, “World News Tonight” anchor David Muir, chief global affairs correspondent Martha RaddatzNBC News: “NBC Nightly News” host Lester Holt, “Meet the Press” host Chuck ToddCBS News: “Face the Nation” host John Dickerson, “CBS This Morning” co-hosts Charlie Rose, Norah O’Donnell and Gayle King, Washington bureau chief Christopher IshamFox News: Co-presidents Bill Shine and Jack Abernethy, EVP of news editorial Jay Wallace, EVP of news and programming Suzanne Scott, and EVP of Fox Business Brian Jones.

76,POLITICS,What's It Like Waiting For Donald Trump To Take Office? A Career Federal Employee Spills The Beans,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-federal-agency_us_58335a9ce4b058ce7aac7526,"""I've never seen anything like this. Never.""",2016-11-21,"President Barack Obama met with his successor, Donald Trump, in the Oval Office on Nov. 10. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58335b251a00000b03cc91e0.jpeg?cache=1y0FOgJ799&ops=crop_13_70_3487_1838%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Federal bureaucrats are used to change. Every four years, they have to deal with the possibility that they’ll get a new boss who could upend all their work and make them chart a new course. And there’s a good chance this new president may not be the person they voted for. Career employees in the government watch presidents of both parties come and go, but they continue to stay where they are and keep the the place running.But there’s something different about this election and the rise of Donald Trump, a man who has never held elected office or served in the military. He’s unpredictable and, to many people in the government, deeply offensive because of many of the comments he made during the campaign.Some career federal employees ― who tend to be nonpolitical and can’t be removed at the whim of a new administration ― find themselves grappling with a crisis that they’ve never encountered with past transitions.The Huffington Post spoke to a senior career official at one of the major federal agencies involved in domestic policy, who requested anonymity for fear of repercussion. Such officials often have decades of experience in government and have worked on several transitions for the agency, including this one. In their experience, they’ve never seen the consternation and fear that federal employees are currently experiencing over the incoming Trump administration.The interview has been edited for concision and clarity.Q: How is this transition going? How is it different from past ones? One thing that’s different is that the president-elect is such an unknown commodity, having really no prior government or military experience. I think that is unique.I think what is really concerning a lot of career individuals is some of the behavior that was exhibited on the campaign trail. What many of them are bringing to my attention and what they’re fearful of is some of that behavior being acceptable in the workplace. So there’s a lot of concern about that.Q: What sort of behavior? Sexual harassment. Sexual misconduct. Discrimination.Q: They fear that what he said and did on the campaign trail could become part of the culture in the federal government?The norm in the federal agencies. We spend so much time on promoting a [fair] work environment for all employees. Individuals who come to me are fearful of going backward in that regard because we’ve made so much progress.Q: Have you seen this much concern from career employees when past administrations have taken over? I’ve never seen anything like this. Never. Never these kinds of concerns. I mean, you can disagree with people from a political or partisan perspective, but the norm is always that you treat people with a certain amount of civility and with decency and respect.Q: Based on your conversations, are career employees planning to stick around or leave? I’ve heard both. Some of the more senior individuals, I’ve heard that they feel that they want to stick around to be a buffer with the new team and their staff. But I also hear people at different levels, if they’re eligible to retire, they say, “I’m going to leave, I do not want to be associated with a new administration.”I’ve heard of at least one example where a person has declined a job because they don’t want to be affiliated with the new administration ― a career position. That’s one position, but it does have the potential to affect the government’s ability to attract talent.Q: How concerned are people with the rumors that Trump and Republicans in Congress are going to change items like federal pay raises and retirement plans? I’m hearing the most concern about the potential hiring freeze that the president-elect stated he was going to impose upon taking office. I’m hearing a lot of concern about that and the impact that will have on our ability to fulfill [our missions].Q: At this point in past transitions, have the president-elect’s teams been further along in getting things ready for the new administration?Yes. The only exception was the contested election in 2000. And that was an isolated situation, definitely.Q: Are you going to stick around? I’m thinking of my options. I think I fall into the caption of being a buffer for my team. We’re exploring our options. I also heard a lot of concern from people who do civil rights and whether that will be valued in the new administration. Q: Have you already started to hand over transition materials to the new administration? We have all our transition materials ready. The landing team, as of now, they have not come. We’re just following the news and waiting for official notification as to when they will arrive.Q: Anything else you’ve observed? I mean, literally, I’ve had employees come to me in tears. They’re very fearful of what’s going to happen.Q: And you haven’t had that before? Never had that before. So I just try to reassure them and we still have laws and policies that will still be in effect. Our expectation will be that people will be held accountable for their actions.I also state that right now, we don’t know who the next secretary or the next deputy secretary will be. But those individuals will be key. They will set the tone for the rest of the agency. And I just tell people to take it one day at a time.Do you work in a federal agency?

Andrew Cuomo (D) plans to investigate the uptick in hate crimes that have occurred in the state since the presidential election, he announced Sunday. Speaking before the congregation at Harlem’s Abyssinian Baptist Church, Cuomo reaffirmed New York’s place as a safe haven for immigrants, people of color and members of the LGBTQ community. But, he said, the state has not been immune from the incidents of intimidation that have occurred in the country since Nov. 8.“Fliers promoting the KKK were found on parked cars in Patchogue, Long Island. A swastika was discovered on the B Train in Manhattan,” he said. “In Wellsville, outside of Buffalo, someone painted a swastika surrounded by the words ‘Make America White Again.’”Verbally condemning such acts isn’t enough, the governor said.“It is also a time for action,” he said. “And the action will start in New York.”The governor announced a series of initiatives aimed at protecting civil rights and stopping “the explosion of hate crimes” in the state. In addition to ordering state police to create a special investigative unit, Cuomo also announced the creation of a legal defense fund for immigrants who cannot afford legal assistance on their own.Because some students on campuses around the country have been targeted, Cuomo also sent an open letter to all New York state college students reminding them of their rights.“As long as you are here, you are New Yorkers. You are members of our community, and we will stand up for you,” he wrote.The governor has won praise in recent weeks for speaking out against the rhetoric and proposed policies of President-elect Donald Trump.“If anyone feels that they are under attack I want them to know that the State of New York ― the state that has the Statue of Liberty in its harbor ― is their refuge,” Cuomo wrote in an email to members of New York’s Democratic Party just after the election. “We won’t allow a federal government that attacks immigrants to do so in our state,” he added.Last week, the governor launched a state-wide hotline for residents to report incidents of bias and discrimination.

He wound up with more union support than expected on election day.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5833351e180000230c30f40d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The union-backed movement Fight for $15 is gearing up for a nationwide day of protests next week, a reminder that working class politics in the U.S. is far more complicated and diverse than post-election autopsies would have you believe.While the group shied away from naming Donald Trump explicitly, its agenda reads as a clear rebuke to the president-elect.In a call with reporters on Monday, representatives of Fight for $15 emphasized that its goal isn’t solely to raise the minimum wage and unionize workers, long its core focus, but also to fend off any attacks on workers’ rights, including efforts to roll back Obamacare.Calling out “newly elected politicians [that] threaten an extremist agenda,” the Service Employees International Union-backed organization said in a statement, “any efforts to block wage increases, gut workers’ rights or healthcare, deport immigrants, or support racism or racist policies, will be met with unrelenting opposition.”Next week’s protests will be the group’s “largest and most disruptive,” Kendall Fells, Fight for $15’s organizing director said in a call with reporters on Monday morning. The group is planning protests at 20 airports, as well as fast-food restaurants and other businesses on Nov. 29. The date marks the four-year anniversary of the organization’s first protests in 2012. Strikes are planned in only a couple of locations, including at Chicago’s O’Hare airport.The protests are the clearest signal yet that “economic anxiety” among American workers without a college degree is hardly the big explanation for the election of Trump. One-third of workers without a college degree are people of color, notes Bryce Covert in The Atlantic, many of whom were repelled by Trump’s campaign and are frightened by his selection of Stephen Bannon as a top advisor. Until recently Bannon ran Breitbart news, a white nationalist pro-Trump news site.And while more union workers backed Trump on Nov. 8 than expected, the election results also showed enormous support for Fight for $15’s core issue. Minimum wage hikes passed in four states in November, including Arizona which voted for Trump. Two states passed paid sick leave laws. For the past several years, raising the federal minimum wage from its current $7.25 an hour has become a relatively popular issue among Americans, regardless of political leaning. The only holdouts on raising the minimum wage seem to be Republican legislators. A majority of states now have a higher wage ceiling than the one set by Congress.And it’s somewhat unclear whether Trump, who made a broad appeal to union workers and the economically downtrodden, supports raising pay. He said last year he doesn’t think the federal government should raise wages, but over the summer he said he was supportive of raising the minimum wage to $10 an hour. “He’s been all over the place,” Fells said.Trump is also reportedly considering for Labor Department secretary Andrew Puzder. The CEO of CKE Restaurants, parent company of Hardee’s, Carl’s Jr., and other fast food outlets is a vehement opponent of raising the minimum wage. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the day of Fight for $15’s first protests in 2012."
79,POLITICS,How Did The Media Handle The White Nationalist Celebration In Washington?,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/white-nationalism-media_us_583326ede4b058ce7aac2b4d,"Did reporters, for example, refer to them as white nationalists?",2016-11-21,Supporters view an inspirational quote following a video presentation at a conference hosted by the white nationalist group National Policy Institute in Washington on Nov. 18. Critics say the group is racist and anti-Semitic.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5833662e1700002600e7bb32.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Over the weekend, a group of white nationalists, emboldened by the election of Donald Trump, descended upon Washington to celebrate having taken one step closer to having their crypto-fascist ideology mainstreamed. The occasion was a meeting of the National Policy Institute, a benign name for an organization, headed by Richard Spencer, that essentially traffics in white-supremacist dogma and neo-Nazi cosplay. As The Huffington Post’s Dana Liebelson and Matt Ferner noted on Friday, white nationalists endeavored “throughout the presidential campaign to sanitize their language to appeal to mainstream voters.” The weekend gathering gave the media a chance to resist this attempt at sanitization.How did they do? Let’s find out!The New York Times: “Alt-Right Exults in Donald Trump’s Election With A Salute: ‘Heil Victory’”Reporter Joseph Goldstein opened with a bit of a scene-setting feint, but didn’t pull his punch, getting right down to business in a third paragraph that showed what happened when, after “11 hours of speeches and panel discussions,” Spencer allowed his polite mask to drop:But now his tone changed as he began to tell the audience of more than 200 people, mostly young men, what they had been waiting to hear. He railed against Jews and, with a smile, quoted Nazi propaganda in the original German. America, he said, belonged to white people, whom he called the “children of the sun,” a race of conquerors and creators who had been marginalized but now, in the era of President-elect Donald J. Trump, were “awakening to their own identity.”Goldstein would re-emphasize this point later in the piece: “But as the night wore on and most reporters had gone home, the language changed.”Overall it took three paragraphs to get to the overt Nazi ideology and literal Nazi salutes. If the piece has any flaws, it is the use of the term “alt right” in the headline, which is critical to mainstreaming this movement.The Washington Post: “After Trump victory, attendance rises at annual white nationalist conference in D.C.”A solid opening paragraph from reporters Steve Hendrix and John Woodrow Cox:White nationalists from around the country gathered Saturday in downtown Washington to bask in Donald Trump’s victory and celebrate what many proclaimed as a coming-out moment in their mission to turn back multiculturalism and eventually create a whites-only “ethno-state” in North America.Overall, the piece treats the notion that this group warrants normalization with a high degree of skepticism, and ties specific actions already taken by the Trump transition team ― such as naming Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) to run the Department of Justice ― as indicative of like-mindedness with this white nationalist movement.The Los Angeles Times: “White nationalists dress up and come to Washington in hopes of influencing Trump.”Easily the worst of the lot, Lisa Mascaro’s piece originally presented Spencer’s organization as a “think tank” and treated the gathering as a whole as if some exciting new smartphone app was being launched. It took five paragraphs for Mascaro to use the term, “white nationalist.” Her buildup to that moment went a long way to normalizing the members of the movement, describing them as “buttoned-down millennials” with a flashy (if fashy!) haircut, “cradling” cups of coffee and going about their “wonky” ways. Inside a beige meeting room at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center, the buttoned-down millennials, in their dark suits and ties, settled in for the long conference day ahead.This will be the account that white nationalists will clip for themselves. I’d wager that The New York Times’ Goldstein reference to reporters who went home early included Mascaro. (Not before getting a rock-star glam-shot of Richard Spencer, however.) The Guardian: “Hitler salutes and white supremacism: a weekend with the ‘alt-right’”The Guardian’s piece mostly avoids euphemisms in its presentation, with the sub-headline reading, “The ‘alt-right’ conference in Washington wasn’t a gathering of forgotten white working class. It was a white nationalist movement buoyed by millennials.” That’s a pretty laudable effort to separate this band of outsiders from the voters with whom the media actually does need to forge a connection.Reporter Adam Gabbatt, however, gets stuck in a waddle of throat-clearing toward the top of his piece, unfortunately ― most notably substituting the term “nationalist” for “white nationalist.”Some of the most prominent members of the so-called “alt-right”, the white nationalist movement that helped propel Donald Trump to the presidency, gathered in Washington DC on Saturday to plot how the movement can “start influencing policy and culture” under the Trump administration.Gabbatt would, in the next paragraph, go on to describe the “series of Nazi salutes” made by attendees, but without the Guardian’s strong article presentation, readers would not have been properly introduced to the group’s white nationalist identity until the eighth paragraph.The Huffington Post: “The ‘Alt-Right’ Is A Hate Movement, And It’s Scarier Than You Think”I’ll let readers be the judge as to whether we did a good job. Per The Huffington Post’s Eliot Nelson:If you want to know why the unabashedly racist and Nazi-sympathizing “alt-right” movement is making a mark on the Trump administration and beyond, look no further than Tila Tequila and her white nationalist friend, Richard Spencer.So there you have it, some praiseworthy work in the mainstream media heap, but lots of room for improvement. Above all, reporters need to remember that glamorizing a movement that lionizes some of the 20th century’s most formidable genocidaires (who were defeated by the people we very recently referred to as “the Greatest Generation”) is a pretty bad look. Richard Spencer has the same haircut as every attacking midfielder in the Premier League. Like his style of dress, it’s not notable. Referring to the National Policy Institute as “wonky” or a “think tank” goes a long way to obscuring the fact that it is, to this day, ceaselessly peddling a racist vision that hasn’t been updated in any meaningful way in decades. This isn’t wonkishness. These ideas haven’t evolved since the last time society rejected them. All that’s new about this is the marketing, and journalists are supposed to be canny enough to recognize a PR offensive when they encounter them in the wild.And pursuant to that, remember: “alt-right” is not a thing. The term you are looking for is “white nationalism.”~~~~~ Jason Linkins edits “Eat The Press” for The Huffington Post and co-hosts the HuffPost Politics podcast “So, That Happened.” Subscribe here, and listen to the latest episode below.

Currently, the workers are employed by subcontractors hired by the airlines.According to CNN Money, some of the workers planning to strike earn the minimum wage, which is $8.25 an hour in Illinois. Although the workers are not in a union, the Service Employees International Union Local 1 is in the process of organizing them. Tom Balanoff, president of SEIU Local 1, told the Chicago Tribune that the union does not expect the strike to shut down the airport, but “it will cause some disruption.”Thanksgiving week is typically air travel’s busiest time of the year in America. AAA predicts that this year’s holiday will be the busiest since 2007, with 3.7 million Americans taking to the skies, a 1.6 percent increase from last year.O’Hare is also notorious for long security lines and flight delays. Just last year, it was ranked the fourth worst airport in the U.S., behind Washington Dulles International, New York’s LaGuardia Airport and New Jersey’s Newark Liberty International."
