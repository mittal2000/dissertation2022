We flying off? We on a boat?”In the end, the 2017 Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee, two-time Super Bowl champion, three-time Pro Bowler and historically great former Broncos running back said he’d have to go with Wilson because “he’s mobile” and “there’s all sorts of situations he’s able to get himself out of.”Davis, 45, talked about that, player safety, anthem protests and more in an interview with HuffPost on Thursday morning. Davis was speaking to reporters as part of a promotional push for Verizon’s new rewards program, VerizonUp. (Note: Verizon owns HuffPost’s parent company, Oath.) The interview has been lightly edited for clarity and transcribed below:HuffPost: Let’s say tomorrow you wake up, and you’ve been named NFL commissioner, with the absolute power to change anything in the league. What’s the first thing you’d do? Davis: I would go back to giving teams more time to practice. More time for padded practices, more time to develop players. They’ve really taken it away from the players ― and a lot of that has been done by the NFL Players Association ― but it’s kind of cheating the players in their development.Training camp is important. The way we’re preparing players coming out of college. Especially the offensive linemen and running backs, in trying to get the running game going, you need actual practice in pads. It’s hard to really get that running game going when you’re just doing simulated drills or you’re doing walk-throughs. I know what it meant to me to get those reps in, and I’m sure it would benefit a lot of other players.What’s stopping NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell or the NFLPA from doing that?It all comes back to players’ safety, and I think the one thing that hurts it is you have some coaches who abuse it, and that’s why they installed it initially. You had some coaches who were practicing super long ― two practices a day with pads on. I’m not sure how you could bring that back and try to make sure that it’s not being abused and that it’s being used properly. If you could time travel, what advice would you give yourself before your first preseason game in 1995, when you were pretty sure you wouldn’t make the team?Just be ready for the opportunity. When it comes, it’s going to come. I can’t tell you when, but when it comes ― be ready.I know you fought through migraines in the past. Are you worried about chronic traumatic encephelopathy at all and how CTE might affect you in the future?Yeah, I think you certainly have to be. This sport is relatively new, and we’re just now starting to see players getting older, getting their brains examined and having signs of CTE, so why would I think that I’m in the clear?There are things that have happened in my life where I might forget something, and, of course, my first thought is, “Is this from playing football or am I getting older?” And I’m not sure. I have a wife and three kids, and you’re always concerned about your health. Are you going to be around when they get older? Yeah, I think about it.I do know that [when I played] 18 years ago, I thought I wouldn’t let my kids play football. I’ve changed my tune for a number of reasons: One, the sport has changed and the awareness is there. If you get dinged and you see stars, you now have to go through the proper protocol, so I like what they’re doing with that. Going back to the grassroots, people growing up playing football are taught differently. The equipment is better. Techniques are being taught differently in terms of where your head should be placed. They don’t hit as much on all levels. Everything they’ve done to decrease the chances of head collisions I’ve been happy with. Both of my sons play flag football, and they want to play tackle. And when it’s time to play tackle, I’m going to let them play.What would you tell NFL players who are concerned about CTE and are looking at their future, thinking of leaving the league early?The first thing to do is look at what their history is. If they have a history of concussions, then I can’t tell anybody to continue to play. It’s really an individual decision. If you don’t have a history of it and you haven’t had any concussions or signs of head trauma, I would tell them the game is safe. And it’s getting safer every day. I don’t tell players whether they should play or not, it’s just up to them.If you were stuck on a deserted island with a QB who’s currently in the league and you had to escape, who would it be, and why?[Laughing] Why would I be escaping a deserted island with a quarterback? Depends on how we’re getting off the island. What’s my escape route? We flying off? We on a boat?Give me Russell Wilson, man. I’m a Russell fan. He’s got all the attacks. He’s mobile, he’s able to deal, there’s all sorts of situations he’s able to get himself out of. He’s a one-man showdown up there in Seattle. I like Russell.You came up with your famous touchdown celebration, the Mile High salute, as a sign of respect for servicemen and women. Is there any advice you’d give players who are kneeling during the anthem in protest of racial inequality?No. Those players weren’t kneeling because they don’t like the military. I stand. I also understand people who don’t want to stand for the anthem and why they’re doing it: It’s not about our military, it’s not about them not liking America. They’re just bringing attention to an issue in the communities that they come from. And I’m all for that.This is a country where we’re taught to fight for things we believe in and speak for people who don’t have a voice. I’ve spoken to a number of servicemen and women who have shared that they don’t mind ― that that’s what they fought for, for us to have that platform and to have the right to do that. So long as it’s a peaceful assembly in protest, they were all for that. "

McDaniel won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress in 1940 for her role as the house servant “Mammy” in “Gone With The Wind.” It wasn’t until 1964 that the next black actor, Sidney Poitier, would win an Academy Award. “Gone With The Wind” won eight Oscars, but all of its black actors ― including McDaniel ― were prohibited from attending the movie’s premiere in Georgia. McDaniel, a native of Wichita, Kansas, was born in 1893 to parents who were freed slaves. She started her career in entertainment as a vaudeville performer, which was a community of entertainers that appeared in variety shows around the U.S. in the late 19th century. She appeared on a radio show in the 1920s, making her one of the first black women to do so, and made her film debut in “The Golden West” in 1932. Civil rights groups criticized the actress for commonly taking on roles portraying domestic workers such as cooks and maids, and the NAACP said her characters often embodied negative racial stereotypes. “I have never apologized for the roles I play,” she wrote in a 1947 article later published in The Hollywood Reporter.She added that she was happy about winning her Oscar, writing:“My own people were especially happy. They felt that in honoring me, Hollywood had honored the entire race. That was the way I wanted it. This was too big a moment for my personal back-slapping. I wanted this occasion to prove an inspiration to Negro youth for many years to come.” CORRECTION: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that McDaniel won her Oscar in 1939. “Gone With The Wind” was released in 1939, but the award ceremony was held in 1940.

Grant joked that his “Love Actually” co-star Emma Thompson is “a genius” who is “not remotely sane. She’s nuttier and nuttier as the years go.”He basically said the same thing of his “Bridget Jones” co-star, Renée Zellweger. “Renée loves me and I love Renée. Well, I mean she’s in the same category as Emma Thompson, in terms of lunacy, but an amazing actress of course, and very generous,” he revealed to People. “She once sent me a fabulous huge volume of beautiful photography, including a lot of semi-undressed women. I remember it because I had just landed in Marrakesh … and the book was impounded.”Despite his praise (if one can call it that) of Zellweger and their apparent affection for each other, Grant told Andy Cohen back in 2016 that most of his former co-stars didn’t think too highly of him. “They all hate me, I think,” he said.Whatever you say, Hugh.

My bad.”The post ends with the hashtag #SanctimoniousHollywood.A Winfrey rep didn’t immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.Winfrey’s rousing Golden Globes speech on Sunday assured young girls that a “new day is on the horizon” when no one will be a victim of sexual abuse, and pointed to Hollywood’s Time’s Up initiative combatting workplace sexual harassment. The stirring address prompted speculation she might run for president in 2020.“The Daily Show” host Trevor Noah said Winfrey would be the “perfect opponent” for President Donald Trump because “she’s everything that he’s not.”Others are skeptical of another celebrity running for the presidency. “Oprah is beyond doubt a magnificent orator,” “Family Guy” creator Seth MacFarlane tweeted on Tuesday. “But the idea of a reality show star running against a talk show host is troublingly dystopian.

But the White House and other senators haven't said yes yet.,2018-01-11,"Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, center, and Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), second left, smile during a meeting with President Donald Trump and bipartisan members of Congress on immigration on Tuesday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a57d4681f00009a00db8475.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― For a fleeting moment on Thursday, it sounded like there might have been a major breakthrough in Congress to protect Dreamers, the young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), one of six senators working on a Dreamer bill, told reporters that the group had agreed on a package that would renew the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) immigration program. But not long after the initial news, the White House and other Republicans rushed to deny any deal had been reached. Negotiations still have “a long ways to go,” White House legislative affairs director Marc Short said Thursday afternoon. With only eight days until a government shutdown, lawmakers still haven’t come to an agreement even within their own parties on what to do about DACA. Democrats want a legislative solution for Dreamers to be part of any must-pass spending package, and many have said they won’t accept certain trade-offs. Meanwhile, many Republicans are just as strong-headed that they won’t budge without new immigration restrictions.At a White House meeting on Thursday, President Donald Trump told a bipartisan group of lawmakers to keep working and rejected the proposal from the group of six that Flake is a part of, according to Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), who was in the meeting and represents the more restrictionist flank of the party on immigration.“It’s not even a fig leaf. It’s a pine needle,” Cotton told reporters. He added later, “It’s a joke of a proposal.”During Thursday’s meeting with lawmakers, Trump reportedly slammed the idea of restoring protections for immigrants from “shithole” countriesEarlier this week, Trump told lawmakers at the White House that he wants three concessions in exchange for signing protections for Dreamers. First, he wants border security, including his signature wall. Second, he wants an end to the diversity visa lottery, which grants green cards to up to 50,000 people from countries with low immigration levels, after vetting. And finally, Trump wants to end what he calls “chain migration,” a term for allowing Americans and legal permanent residents to sponsor family for green cards beyond spouses and minor children.The White House hasn’t yet said what it would be willing to agree to for actually helping Dreamers. Short told reporters that it would be narrower than the Dream Act ― a bill to grant legal status to a larger group of young undocumented immigrants than DACA ― but that Trump was open to eventual legal status and citizenship, depending on what he got in return. The six-senator group’s deal addresses all of the areas the president asked for, according to a statement released on Thursday afternoon by the group, which along with Flake includes Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.). Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), and Bob Menendez (D-N.J.). They have not yet released the proposal publicly but said they “are now working to build support for that deal in Congress.”But the proposal put forward by the group of six in the Senate remains far from what House Republicans are proposing. Lawmakers there have taken Trump’s principles and put forward a bill with even more immigration restrictions, though they say their additional measures are all part of the “border security” plank. The White House issued a statement praising the bill but singling out only its previously-stated policy principles.Democrats immediately dismissed that House GOP bill, with progressive coalitions in Congress pushing back against Trump’s initial demands, let alone the expanded provisions in the Republican legislation.The Congressional Tri-Caucus ― made up of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus ― has called for a “clean” bill to help Dreamers. If they don’t get help for Dreamers, they’re not going to vote for a funding bill, said Hispanic Caucus member Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.).Democratic members have suggested they’re willing to negotiate on some issues, but there are lines they won’t cross. Eliminating the diversity visa lottery and family-based visas isn’t something Democrats could support, Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.) said, although he added that they might discuss changes to how to administer or lay out the programs. Some lawmakers have floated ending the diversity visa lottery but giving those visas to people who hold temporary protected status. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas), a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, said that would amount to pitting “needy people against needy people.” “That is taking the last crumbs out of the basket, walking into an impoverished community and throwing them on the ground,” Jackson Lee said. “That is unacceptable.” Rep. Norma Torres (D-Calif.), another member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said if a deal includes ending the diversity visa lottery and ending family-based visa categories, she’d likely oppose it.“We should not be talking about anything other than fixing [Dreamers’] immigration status,” she said. If that’s the standard for Democrats on the left, and if Republicans in Congress and the White House are still insisting on items like a wall and an end, in their words, to “chain migration,” it’s difficult to see any quick agreement.If no deal comes together over the next week, Congress must pass yet another short-term funding extension, their fourth for a fiscal year that began in October. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said Thursday he planned to put forth another “clean” continuing resolution (CR) next week, with a broader deal already looking unlikely to be finalized in a few legislative days.But Democrats aren’t sounding all that supportive of another short-term extension, with progressives in the House signaling that delaying this fight even longer isn’t palatable to them. At the end of December, 119 Democrats voted against a CR, and that number could quickly rise next week. Complicating this legislative discussion is the fact that Congress won’t actually be putting forth a “clean” CR. Sequestration ― the automatic spending cuts that were set in 2011 ― is set to trigger on Jan. 21 absent a deal raising spending caps. When HuffPost asked House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) whether conservatives would support raising the caps temporarily in a CR, Meadows said he’d favor suspending sequestration for only defense. “I don’t know that there is an appetite to increase caps without a better understanding of where our appropriations efforts are headed,” he said.Former Freedom Caucus Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) also told HuffPost on Thursday afternoon that he opposed raising non-defense spending caps in a CR as well. “I do not remember the American people electing us to do that,” he said.When pressed if he was willing to enter a shutdown over the issue, Jordan reiterated that he was fine raising the spending limits for the military, and if Democrats wouldn’t accept increasing the caps for just defense, it would be them shutting down the government and denying troops a pay raise.Still, barring a mutiny over the caps, Republicans expect they’ll be able to pass a short-term extension in the House and then get the Senate to back the bill allowing for more time. But there’s some uncertainty that Senate Democrats would vote for another CR themselves.“There are many reasons that I may not support a CR, including I think it’s time that we take care of our Dreamers,” Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) told HuffPost on Thursday.When HuffPost asked if he thought Democrats were willing to enter into a shutdown over a dispute on a short-term government funding extension, Merkley said the only responsibility for a shutdown would be with Republicans and the administration. “They’re in charge,” he said.But other Senate Democrats sounded a little more hesitant.Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said he didn’t know whether Jan. 19th ― the day funding is set to expire ― was the line, or if Democrats would extend the deadline. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) said it’d be “silly” to shut down the government. And Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said there was no need for a crisis.It’s unclear, however, how much of that talk downplaying a shutdown is just spin. Democrats say it’d be on Republicans if there was a shutdown. “The only person who’s been tweeting about a shutdown was the president of the United States,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) told HuffPost on Thursday. But he also said Democrats couldn’t keep kicking these issues “down the road forever.”"

Yep, you’re in a bar, and you’re hoping to somehow stand out and get the bartender’s attention in a sea of thirsty people who want the exact same thing. So how do you do it?We spoke to two bartenders to get some insight into how to get them to notice you and to learn what makes you a good customer (or a bad customer, of course).Most of the advice both bartenders offered can be summed up in two words: Be patient. Gita D. has been a bartender off and on for the past 12 1/2 years, working in Los Angeles, California, as well as Florida. She told HuffPost her biggest pet peeve is when customers clearly see she’s busy and interrupt her to try and sneak their order in.“You’re running around and sort of talking to yourself ― ‘That guy needs a Stella; this guy needs a margarita, an Old-Fashioned and a martini; I need to close the Jones tab,’” she said. “The biggest pet peeve is if someone interjects into that and throws you off track ... assuming that I’m not doing anything, even if I’m clearly standing at the computer.”Will D., 27, is a full-time bartender in Alabama, and he echoed Gita’s sentiments. “You aren’t the only person we’re taking care of,” he said. “Yes, you are important to us, but allow us to distribute our time with other guests when talking or even when asking for more things.”If you want to grab the bartender’s attention, Will said “a simple wave or eye contact will suffice.” Gita also suggested eye contact, but she added that staying off your phone and having your cash or card ready to go can help.“If you’re ordering drinks for more than just yourself, have them all prepared. Know what your friends want to drink,” she said. “If you’ve got a credit card or you’ve got cash, that’s a signal that you want to order something. If you have it out, in your hand, ready to go, that’s my best signal.”As drinks expert David Wondrich pointed out to The New York Times, though, having your card or cash ready to go is much different than obnoxiously waving it around. As for tipping, both bartenders said 20 percent is the standard. Will told HuffPost some customers will leave $1 per drink for smaller orders, which usually suffices. Gita suggested that before tipping, consider the style of the bar and the complexity of your drink.“If you’re at a fancier place, and it takes four minutes to construct your drink, depending on the quality of the drink and the style of the bartender you may want to throw them an extra buck, or two or three,” she said. In an interview with Lifehacker, two bartenders also noted that “a decent tip on your first drink says a lot.”Bartenders are, after all, only human, and they can help you out when you’re in a bind. “I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been yelled or cursed at for making a very minor mistake at work and how much that affects my attitude for the rest of the shift,” Will said. “Be mindful of how you talk to us!”And bartenders are often excellent resources for things other than your delicious drinks. “If you’re getting too drunk, ask your bartender to call you a cab. That’s what we’re there for,” Gita said. “If you’re on a really bad date, let your bartender know ― sometimes you want to get away from [the date], sometimes you’re scared for your safety.”She added later, “Our job is to help you loosen up ... we’re a part of the party, and it’s a fun gig to have.”"

It was wrong.”Hoekstra claimed at a 2015 anti-terrorism conference that Muslims were causing “chaos in the Netherlands,” burning cars and politicians and creating “no-go zones” in that country. He told De Telegraaf that he couldn’t recall what his comments were based on. “I mixed up countries. I was wrong. I can’t recall how that could happen. I know: I was wrong,” he said.Hoekstra has been scorched by the Dutch over the comments, and his De Telegraaf interview appeared to be an attempt to make amends after a tough week.During his first news conference on Wednesday, Dutch journalists refused to let Hoekstra off the hook and peppered the former Republican congressman from Michigan with questions asking if he still believed those widely debunked claims.Hoekstra then doggedly refused to retract his past comments or provide concrete examples to back up his claims, The Washington Post reported. The Dutch journalists responded to his reluctance by piling on their questions. “Are politicians being burned in the Netherlands in the past? Is that something you believe? Yes or no?” one reporter asked. “Could you please take back the remark about burned politicians or name the politician that was burned in the Netherlands?” another asked.“Why don’t you answer the question?” others chimed in, after Hoekstra attempted to move on.At one point, a frustrated journalist declared, “This is the Netherlands. You have to answer questions.”Roel Geeraedts, a reporter at the Dutch television station RTL Nieuws, tweeted a video of the tense news conference. “The only one who did get burned today is... Hoekstra himself. By refusing to answer our questions,” he wrote.Hoekstra made those claims about Islam during a recorded panel discussion in November 2015. The panel was sponsored by the David Horowitz Freedom Center, a Los Angeles-based organization known for promoting anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim ideologies.“The Islamic movement is now gotten to a point where they have put Europe into chaos,” Hoekstra said back then, according to Reuters. “Chaos in the Netherlands ― there are cars being burned. There are politicians that are being burned and, yes, there are no-go zones in the Netherlands.”In fact, there have been no instances of modern Dutch politicians being set on fire, Geeraedts noted in his tweet. The rumor about Muslims in the Netherlands or other parts of Europe creating no-go zones where non-Muslims aren’t welcome is also unsubstantiated, although the myth is often promoted by right-wing groups and individuals seeking to spread misinformation about Islam. Hoekstra has often made erroneous comments about Muslims and their faith. He has speculated that up to 15 percent of all Muslims could be radical extremists, according to CNN. Given that there are roughly 1.8 billion Muslims in the world, that would amount to about 270 million people. He’s also claimed in the past that Hillary Clinton’s longtime aide Huma Abedin had ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. That conspiracy theory has been thoroughly debunked.Last month in Washington, a Dutch reporter from the Nieuwsuur television program questioned Hoekstra about the “no-go zones” comment. Hoekstra asserted he hadn’t said that ― again, even though his 2015 remarks were recorded.When HuffPost asked about the clash at this week’s press conference, a U.S. State Department spokesperson pointed to a tweet that Hoekstra sent out in December addressing the interview with Nieuwsuur. In that tweet, the ambassador expressed “regret” about the exchange.Hoekstra was born in the Netherlands and moved to the United States as a young child. The onetime congressman, who served from 1993 to 2011, sat for a period on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.In 2014, he joined the Investigative Project on Terrorism, a nonprofit that claims to be the “world’s most comprehensive data center on radical Islamic terrorist groups.” It was founded by Steve Emerson, a self-proclaimed terrorism expert whom the Southern Poverty Law Center has labeled an anti-Muslim extremist with a history of spreading misinformation about Islam.The Investigative Project on Terrorism quotes Hoekstra praising it as a “national treasure whose influence and achievements are unparalleled.” Trump nominated Hoekstra to the position of ambassador this past July. He was confirmed by the Senate in November.Mary Papenfuss contributed to this report.This article has been updated with Hoekstra’s retraction of his 2015 remarks."
9,POLITICS,A Tiny Tax Hike On People Who Bike To Work Helps Explain The Whole GOP Tax Law,Arthur Delaney and Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bike-tax-benefit-gop-tax-law_us_5a57aaa8e4b018a4f8b6d91f,Nobody seems to know why Republicans singled out cyclists' benefits.,2018-01-11,Eliminating the bike benefit will likely raise a mere $5 million a year in federal revenue.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a57c7c71f00003c00db8442.jpeg?cache=GdUALnV58i&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Tucked inside the sweeping tax package Republicans rushed to enact last month is a tiny provision targeting people who bike to work.Since 2009, businesses have been able to give workers who commute on bikes a tax-free benefit worth $20 a month to cover bike-related expenses. Not anymore: Cyclists will now have to pay taxes on that money.“It’s an example of the cats and dogs in this bill,” Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Oregon), a staunch advocate of the bike benefit, told HuffPost. “Every week we’re going to find something else that really wasn’t discussed that matters to tens of thousands of people ― in this case, hundreds of thousands of people potentially.”Implemented in the wake of the Great Recession, the modest benefit for cyclists was meant to put more parity in the U.S. tax code between those who bike to work and those who drive or take mass transit. Commuters in the latter category have long been eligible for a tax benefit on parking fees and transit fares ― in the form of a tax break on up to $255 of their monthly pay.Although the bike benefit was pocket change by comparison, cycling advocates say it was an important recognition by the federal government that not everyone drives or takes the subway to work. If your employer provided the benefit, you got reimbursed with tax-free money for necessary cycling expenses ― like a bike purchase, a tune-up or new equipment such as tires or a helmet.The benefit also served as a modest incentive for people to take a healthy and environmentally friendly mode of travel to their jobs.“Whether or not you have free or subsidized parking is a massive determinant in whether you drive to work,” explained Colin Browne, a spokesman for the Washington Area Bicyclist Association, an advocacy group for D.C.-area cyclists. “This was a small way to try to balance that out and give folks an alternative.”The elimination of the bike benefit offers a useful window into how Republicans carried out their very complicated overhaul of the tax code with stunning speed. For starters, many lawmakers, let alone members of the public, didn’t even know the measure was in the bill. No one HuffPost spoke to was able to identify the member or members of Congress who targeted the benefit for elimination. The change first cropped up in a Senate version of the tax package.Spokespeople for the Senate Finance Committee, which drafted the upper chamber’s version of the bill, didn’t respond to a simple question: Why target bikes?Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), who is retiring from Congress at the end of this year, couldn’t explain it either when HuffPost asked.“We’ve had a lot of different priorities and we didn’t always keep everything we wanted to keep,” Hatch said, even though the final version of the bill did keep the bike provision.According to Blumenauer, elimination of the bike benefit will raise an estimated $5 million a year for the federal government ― barely a rounding error among the $1.5 trillion in tax cuts. Since the provision barely affects revenue, the cycling advocates HuffPost interviewed sensed a political motivation at play. After all, even though people all over the country bike to work, the cyclists are more likely to live in or near big cities than in rural areas.Like the highly controversial elimination of the state and local tax deduction, the death of the bike benefit may have been a way to stick it to liberals who live on the coasts, shop at Whole Foods and vote for Democrats. But nobody seems to know for sure.“It could certainly be that. Or it could just be one [senator] who had a bad experience with a cyclist,” said Ken McLeod, policy director at the League of American Bicyclists, a national advocacy group. “It’s a relatively innocuous benefit that doesn’t cost the federal government pretty much anything. It seems like it must be a personal or cultural thing rather than actual public policy.”The bike policy is one of several changes to employee fringe benefits in the new tax law, which offsets the revenue lost in corporate and individual tax cuts with an assortment of revenue increases. Tens of billions of dollars will be raised by disallowing employers from deducting the full value of worker compensation that takes the form of commuter benefits, entertainment, meals and employee achievement awards.The law still allows employers to deduct bike-specific compensation on their corporate returns, but doesn’t let them provide that monthly $20 tax-free to employees. Workers who drive or take mass transit, however, can still get tax-free reimbursements.It’s unclear if employers will continue to provide the bike benefit if it’s less attractive to workers. The League of American Bicyclists encouraged bike commuters to take full advantage of their benefits before the end of last year.Along with Blumenauer, Rep. Vern Buchanan (R-Fla.) is co-chair of the congressional bike caucus. He’s also a member of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, yet even he seemed blindsided by the shift in bike tax policy.“We gotta change that,” Buchanan said. “I just haven’t focused on that but now that you brought it up, I will.”Arthur Delaney co-hosts the HuffPost Politics podcast:"

Lapland Hotels has teamed up with HBO Nordic to create a “Game of Thrones”-themed hotel sculpted out of snow and ice. Each room features an ice sculpture: There’s a ferocious white walker with glowing blue eyes, an icy replication of Braavos’ Hall of Faces and a life-size iron throne. Inside temperatures can dip to 23 degrees Fahrenheit, so the hotel recommends only staying for one night ― even though overnight guests are given thermal sleeping bags to help them stay warm. The hotel has 10 overnight rooms that start at $200. It’s part of a larger attraction that includes a movie theater, a chapel, and restaurant and bar carved out of ice. The SnowVillage is set to be open until April 30.See more photos of the “Game of Thrones”-themed hotel below."

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Tuesday accused President Donald Trump of failing to live up to his campaign promises.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/592495451600002200ddc712.jpeg?cache=GyDxohGIL7&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) savaged President Donald Trump’s budget proposal on Tuesday, accusing the president of turning his back on campaign pledges to stand up for struggling Americans.Sanders, who caucuses with Democrats, rattled off the budget’s numerous cuts to safety net and social insurance programs, as well as tax cuts for wealthy Americans and corporations, while speaking at a press conference held by Democratic leaders in Congress.Trump’s fiscal priorities prove he was never a serious advocate for the working and middle classes, the senator added.“When Donald Trump campaigned for president, he told the American people he would be a different type of Republican, that he would take on the political and economics establishment, that he would stand up for working people, that he understood the pain that families all across this country were experiencing,” said Sanders, the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee.“Well, sadly this budget exposes all of that verbiage for what it really was: just cheap and dishonest campaign rhetoric that was meant to get votes ― nothing more than that,” he added. “At a time when the rich are already getting richer, while the middle class continues to shrink, this is a budget for the billionaire class, for Wall Street, for corporate CEOs and for the wealthiest people in this country.”Trump’s budget makes cuts to disability insurance under Social Security, even though he promised not to touch the program, noted Rep. John Yarmuth (D-Ky.), the ranking member of the House Budget Committee. Yarmuth appeared at the press conference alongside Sanders, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).“The president’s budget was a betrayal, a line-by-line tally of broken promises he made to the American people,” Yarmuth said.It’s ultimately up to Congress to decide how much to spend on everything from the military to programs like Meals on Wheels. Still, Trump’s budget is a useful window into the White House’s worldview ― which is why Democrats have wasted no time pouncing on it.The rhetoric of Sanders, who launched an unexpectedly competitive bid for the Democratic presidential nomination with a campaign platform of economic populism, has sometimes been compared to that of Trump, who found success by highlighting his anti-establishment tendencies (albeit with a racial demagoguery that was anathema to Sanders).Sanders has a made a point of trying to hold Trump to his promises to fight for working people ― even insisting that it could be grounds for bipartisan cooperation.The Vermont senator said in a statement the day after the election that he and other progressives would be willing to work with the president “to the degree that [he] is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country.”For a lawmaker like Sanders, this was a win-win proposition. In the unlikely event that Trump governed progressively, Sanders could claim a policy victory. And the senator had ammunition to attack the president if he did not.So far, Sanders hasn’t found much to like in Trump’s agenda ― even when it comes to issues like trade policy, on which Sanders and Trump both defy the bipartisan, pro-business consensus in favor of trade agreements. The support of Democratic senators ensured the confirmation of United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, a trade hawk who enjoys a good reputation among progressive experts. But Sanders was one of 11 members of the Democratic caucus to vote against confirming Lighthizer, complaining that the nominee was insufficiently committed to reforming a status quo on trade that privileges corporate profits over human need."
14,POLITICS,Donald Trump's Budget Makes A Really Basic Numbers Error,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-budget-numbers-error_us_5924a930e4b0ec129d3054e7,Whoops!,2017-05-23,"Mick Mulvaney, director of the White House's Office of Management and Budget, tried to defend an arithmetic error identified by center-left economist Lawrence Summers. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5924a9d12000003a0016e813.jpeg?cache=qfN6HzwP7N&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The White House made a basic mathematical error when trying to prove that massive tax cuts would pay for themselves and then some, according to a leading economist who advised former President Barack Obama. In a column in The Washington Post on Tuesday, Lawrence Summers, who directed Obama’s national economic council from 2009 to 2010, took the current White House to task for double-counting $2 trillion in revenue it predicts its tax cuts will generate.President Donald Trump’s budget proposal assumes that the tax cuts it would enact for wealthy individuals and corporations, as well as its reductions in regulations, will create consistent 3 percent economic growth ― enough to generate $2 trillion a year in additional revenue.That projection in itself is dubious; tax cuts rarely, if ever, spur enough growth to replenish the revenue they cost the Treasury. But it is nonetheless a prediction consistent with the supply-side economics that Republicans have been peddling for decades.Where Trump’s budget team really got it wrong is in claiming that the tax cuts would both pay for themselves and close the existing budget deficit.“This is an elementary double count,” Summers writes. “You can’t use the growth benefits of tax cuts once to justify an optimistic baseline and then again to claim that the tax cuts do not cost revenue. At least you cannot do so in a world of logic.”New York magazine’s Jonathan Chait shoots down one plausible explanation for the error.“Trump could be assuming that his tax cuts will not only pay for themselves but generate $2 trillion in higher revenue. But Trump has not claimed his tax cuts will recoup more than 100 percent of their lost revenue, so it’s simply an embarrassing mistake,” he writes.Mick Mulvaney, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, defended the apparent mistake in his press conference on Tuesday.He claimed that any overly rosy assumptions about tax cut-generated revenue are more than offset by conservative estimates elsewhere. For instance, the administration did not account for the ways in which simplifying the tax code could allow the government to collect taxes that normally go unpaid, because people either do not understand their taxes or are too frustrated by their complexity to pay them, according to Mulvaney.“If you can really fill out your ... tax returns on a single piece of paper, you’re much more likely to actually do it. It’s also easier for us to see if you’re paying the right amount,” he said.Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin was more forthright about the arithmetic error in an interview with CNBC’s John Harwood on Tuesday, emphasizing that the budget is merely a “preliminary document.” During a House Budget Committee hearing on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, Mulvaney flatly denied that Trump’s budget double-counts $2 trillion in revenue, despite evidence otherwise.“The dynamic benefit is only counted one time and that’s toward the 3 percent economic growth. And I’m happy to explain that to you further in writing if you like,” he told Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.).“You can explain whatever you’d like, you are counting revenue twice,” Wasserman Schultz shot back. “And saying that the budget is balanced, and anyone running their household budget would be in serious trouble down the road ― that is where you are taking us.”This article has been updated with additional comment from Mulvaney.

15,TRAVEL,"Trump's Policies May Cost The U.S. $1.3 Billion, And That's Just In Travel",Suzy Strutner,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/travel-loss_us_59245a70e4b034684b103c13,Experts say his moves could cost lots of jobs.,2017-05-23,"International tourism makes about $250 billion annually for the U.S., according to the Department of Commerce.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5924857f2000003a0016e740.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The U.S. will likely miss out on more than $1.3 billion in travel-related expenditures this year, in part due to the Trump administration’s policies, one international business travel group predicts.A loss in that range could mean thousands of lost jobs, and some other analysts project the overall monetary losses will be much higher.Political events like Brexit, President Donald Trump’s executive order “travel bans,” new laptop bans in the U.S. and U.K. and rumors of an expanded U.S. laptop ban have created “uncertainty” that’s keeping some international travelers from visiting the U.S., according to a new report from the Global Business Travel Association, which represents corporate travel managers and professionals. The organization’s researchers analyzed airfare bookings, figures like GDP and oil prices and a Department of Commerce survey to come up with an “uncertainty forecast” of $1.3 billion in losses in hotel, food, rental car and shopping spending related to travelers. The figure also includes $175 million in lost business travel-related wages for Americans during 2017.“This devastating economic impact could take years to recover from,” wrote GBTA’s executive director & COO Mike McCormick. Staff at Oxford Economics said that projection is far too low. The global advisory firm is predicting an even bigger drop in travel to the U.S. this year, one that would result in a total loss of over $2.4 billion. The cause, they say, is Trump’s harmful rhetoric affecting perceptions abroad.“’America first’ rhetoric, which was pronounced during the campaign and Trump’s inauguration speech, is finding consistent expression in policy,” said Adam Sacks, president of Oxford Economics’s tourism department. “International markets are receiving a message that America is no longer a welcoming destination.”The federal government estimates the value of international travel and tourism to the U.S. at about $250 billion annually, with three percent growth projected every year, said Patrick Surry, chief data scientist at travel site Hopper. The GBTA’s forecasted $1.3 billion loss represents about a .5 percent shift. But that’s too conservative in Surry’s eyes: Hopper’s recent research shows a more pronounced drop in U.S. travel interest since Trump took office. Chinese travelers, for example, have searched for flights to the U.S. 40 percent less than average since Trump took office.The Middle East represents a particularly big hit, according to both the GBTA and Oxford Economics.“We’re seeing a 30 percent decline in travel to the U.S. from the Middle East at the moment,” Sacks said. “This means that the U.S. economy stands to lose about $1 billion from Middle East travelers alone [this year].” Emirates Airlines recently cut service to the U.S. after demand weakened in the wake of Trump’s travel bans and the Department of Homeland Security laptop ban, which was enacted in late March. And in a GBTA poll conducted after Trump’s initial travel ban, about half of European business executives said they would plan their travel elsewhere.Amid Trump’s review of certain work visas and rumors of an expanded laptop ban, “global travel markets will take further cues that the U.S. is not as welcoming as it once was,” Sack said.Ouch."

Teaching these practical business skills, financial literacy, and with technology-focused classes we can better prepare students for future jobs. This is only half the story though, future entrepreneurs and leaders will need to have developed skills that go beyond business basics and financial literacy. The education system needs to develop children’s critical thinking skills and move away from the memorize-repeat cycle. The system also needs to develop children’s creativity and ingenuity in addition to so many other personality and behavioral traits that fuel entrepreneurs to thrive despite of the challenges they will surely face. If we are to reform the education system so it no longer fails our youth, but instead acts as a springboard for them to lead successful and fulfilling lives, we need to teach with the future in mind and to the opportunities that will be available. As much as it’s said that our children are our future, then we need to start investing in them and in their education, so they not only live up to their own potential, but make our region more competitive globally and create great examples of Arab progress and innovation.

Contestant Lucas listed his profession as “whaboom” on his cast bio, and unfortunately he did little during the premiere to enlighten the audience, or Rachel, as to how exactly he makes a living as a whaboom. Nonetheless, he leaned wayyy into his brand. Lucas exited the limo toting a megaphone and sporting a muscle tank emblazoned with the word, which is apparently his signature catchphrase. (It punctuates a moment, like “boom” but, uh, more obnoxious.)During the evening, he treated the Bachelorette, the other suitors, and America to a series of “whabooms” so loud, sustained, and passionate that his neck veins bulged, his face purpled, and at one point he tumbled onto the floor.He also made use of his megaphone to announce to Rachel that one of his testicles is larger than the other (errmkay...) and to narrate loudly her one-on-one time with another, unfortunate bachelor. Lucas’ non-stop whabooming was so aggressively unpleasant that it easily beat out a couple other strong contenders for Most Off-putting: Milton, who repeatedly treated Rachel to feline growls of approval; Jamey, who unironically cited his $2,000 suit as a selling point; and Jonathan, whose limo exit involved a surprise tickle party.

He and his wife Reepthi Gangula in attendance at a vigil for their friend.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59237f50200000180016e469.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This piece was originally published in Kajal Magazine.The second season of radio station WNYC’s documentary podcast The United States of Anxiety has taken up the theme of “culture wars.” The season opened with an episode entitled “Whose Kansas Is It Anyway?” on the murder of Srinivas Kuchibhotla in Olathe, Kansas in February and its ripple effects on the Indian-American community there.The episode focuses on the notion of created culture, the idea that beliefs and behaviors become embedded in our society through a seeding and cultivating process led by prominent public figures, like politicians and presidents. It asks the question, then, what cultivated cultures in our Trumpian state led to the murder of Kuchibhotla and what do the vulnerable do to fight back?Unfortunately, Anxiety’s narrative itself suffers huge gaps in nuance and context. It presents narratives that are devoid of class consciousness, conveniently blithe about Islamophobia, and hegemonic in their centering of a deficiently defined “Indian-American experience,” itself hardly monolithic in reality.To begin, the episode largely avoids the elephant in the room when it comes to talking about anti-South Asian hate crimes — that many of the high profile crimes against South Asian Americans since 9/11 have been perpetrated by those who perceived, sometimes incorrectly, they were targeting Muslims. It is critical to note that in Anxiety, it doesn’t appear that any Indian-American interviewed for the program was Muslim, even though Indian Muslims do in fact exist. An Indian Muslim interlocutor would perhaps have been able to provide a perspective on standing at the intersections of marginalized identities in this political moment. Instead, the interviewees tend to chalk up the anti-Indian attitudes they perceive and the discrimination they face to a more generalized, unspecific fear of a brown “other” who appears as a threat.If fear of brown skin is the diagnosis for the violent outbursts symptomatic of bigotry, then is it truly sensible for this episode to focus only on Indian Americans among South Asians? “Indian” as a label to describe a victim of a hate crime is an oversimplifying descriptor to begin with, since Indians themselves encompass many different communities of people who become targets for different reasons. Balbir Singh Sodhi was attacked and killed because of his outward presentation as a Sikh, which in turn caused him to be perceived as an Arab Muslim by his killer — not necessarily just because he was “brown” or Indian.This rhetoric also hides underlying fermentations of hatred with geopolitical ignorance. Are Sri Lankans, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, and Nepalis not just as vulnerable by virtue of being a similar threatening shade of brown as their Indian-American counterparts? Sri Lankans and Nepalis, for instance, are consistently left out of discussions of South Asian diaspora lives in the USA. As for Pakistani and Bangladeshi-Americans, are we to assume that because many of them are actually the thing bigots decided people like Kuchibhotla and Sodhi were — Muslim — that somehow they can’t be what Amitava Kumar called, in the New Yorker, “the mistaken people”?Srinivas Kuchibhotla’s killer mistook him for an Iranian, inarguably therefore for a Muslim (non-Muslim Iranians exist aplenty to be sure, but do we expect your average white supremacist with a gun to know that?). If Indian-Americans are to be recipients of special sympathy for being ‘mistaken’ victims of hate crimes, that suggests if Kuchibhotla were actually Iranian, his murder would be sad, but technically speaking, logical — the unmistaken victim. You cannot have one without the other, after all.The statement that haunted many in the wake of Kuchibhotla’s death was the fearful inquiry made by his wife Sunayna Dumala in a Facebook post — “Do we belong here?” As such, the program could have given a platform for the voices of people who have faced the strongest manifestations of anti-immigrant attitudes and policies, like working-class and undocumented folks. Anxiety instead chooses to center perspectives of the privileged and upwardly and geographically mobile. They speak to Raj Bhala, a law professor, and his wife, Kara Tan Bhala, the founder of think tank Seven Pillars Institute. What can be said other than that listening to them, I felt subjected to the detached musings of an elitist, faux-cosmopolitan class?Reflecting on the way Kansas and the USA have changed since the early 2000s, the couple admits they are thinking about “taking a break” from it all, perhaps even leaving the country. Tan Bhala notes that extremism comes and goes in cycles, so they could just step out a side door until the “pendulum swings back” — and then so will they, restored to their previous, coveted positions of security.It is dismaying that a presumably serious piece of documentary journalism on race and immigration would choose to answer the question of do we/you belong here with maybe not now, maybe you should just get out of Dodge for a while, as if escaping racism and violence is a matter of taking a vacation or asking for a transfer at your job. It’s astoundingly myopic in its outlook, not to mention massively exclusionary. If “going back home for a while” is the solution, then those who aren’t wealthy, mobile or socioeconomically connected enough to afford the airline ticket, the new apartment’s rent, and the social uprooting are, politely speaking, utterly fucked. Even better, those who don’t have a ‘home’ of their diasporic, nostalgic choosing to return to should have gotten the memo long ago, spared themselves the trouble and just died already.Checking out is not an answer to white supremacist violence if you truly consider yourself a member of any community besides a self-serving one.Finally, no documentary on middle and upper-middle class Indian Americans would be complete without a discussion of model minorities. The critique of Asian American model minority myths as a cover for antiblack and anti-Latinx racism has been well-developed by scholars like Vijay Prashad, also interviewed in Anxiety. The episode rehashes many of those points. But then, its participant interviewees posit the myth as truth, and the truth as a bizarre rationalization of white hatred.Anxiety speaks to Venkat, an IT professional, his white friend Richard, and Richard’s Indian-born wife Pamina about their interpretations of the changes they’ve witnessed in recent months. Venkat describes becoming more aware of race and microaggressions. Yet he believes that people like the Bhalas are overreacting in their rush to clear out of Kansas and the USA. Richard chips in with the White Perspective (™), saying that the demographic changes, especially the influx of Indian Americans into the suburbs of the area, came as a shock to the white folks who had been living there and accustomed to their status as a numerical majority. He explains that such shaken white neighbors may harbor resentment at those brown people living in their subdivisions who appear to be “doing so well” at the presumable expense of whites, who are increasingly suffering socioeconomic decline.To any critical listener’s horror, Venkat and his wife imply justification for this rationale, rather than calling out the fiction of immigration and economic success as a zero-sum game. Instead, Pamina admits with pride that Indians work extra, extra hard, and that may be why they face suspicion and annoyance. Venkat, partially agreeing with her point, wonders if there might be a “perception problem” causing this misunderstanding between disgruntled white people and Indian-Americans, because as he puts it, it appears by average Western standards that Indians essentially have no work-life balance. (No, really.)That this documentary has the temerity to end with an intimation that Indian-Americans — who do face what is very real suspicion and resentment in their communities, which does boil over into violence — may be victims of their own success by setting themselves up as pie-stealing bogeypeople in deluded white supremacists’ eyes. I’ve heard the model minority myth weaponized as a tool to declare Asian Americans too robotic to succeed in innovative and creative industries. This might be the first time I’ve heard it used as a tool to scold people that they literally brought death upon themselves.This documentary was a hot mess, but it does in fact reproduce common narratives about American diasporas, including racist forms of false consciousness that are hardly original in their odiousness. Ultimately, what is truly frustrating about these frameworks for considering the contemporary rise in anti-South Asian violence is how narrow they are in their consideration of what constitutes the South-Asian American community, which has always been so much more than a model-minority, picture perfect band of doctors and engineers. It’s impossible to articulate the reasons for violence against a group of people if you don’t even understand the dynamics of that group in all its diversity.Worst of all, an oversimplified narrative of victimization misleads us into believing in an oversimplified, outwardly directed solution to the predicaments of anti-South Asian bigotry in its many forms. In the same post where Dumala eulogized her husband, she recalled multiple times his admiration for the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who he saw as a strong leader of contemporary India. It left me wondering, did this brutally, unjustly murdered man, killed on the pretext of being a Muslim Iranian interloper, care that his dear leader presided over a Muslim genocide in 2002? Would he have found the string of lynchings of Muslims and lower caste peoples by fanatical “cow-protector” Hindu nationalist across Modi’s India right now as unconscionable as those of us still living found his death? In other words, what do we do about combating white bigotry if we aren’t even ready to look out for each other, in our own communities?Middle class Indian-Americans’ precariously elevated place as a good minority in American society relies on cultivating proximity to whiteness. That means, in practice, a distancing from from all those who would sully their clean reputations — the dirty poor, the dirty Muslim terror suspects, the dirty undocumented workers, the dirty lower-caste folks. The responses to the questions posed to the Indian Americans featured in Anxiety don’t suggest that a readiness to close that distance in the quest for true liberation and justice. If we continue to allow voices like the ones amplified here to occupy the center of dialogues about South Asian diaspora and discrimination, it’s not liberation that will be coming, but further marginalization of the most vulnerable by the most secure."

Trump will be the guest of honor at a men-only Toby Keith concert in Saudi Arabia. A scenario so bizarre, it’s scarcely believable. But that’s where we’re at now: we live in scarcely believable times.It’s not because of the “fake news” phenomena—however you define that term. The blame for the scarce believability of current events in America lies squarely on the hunched shoulders of the hobgoblin who has taken up residence in the White House.Trump has always been hard to believe. In the ‘80s and ‘90s, the New York real-estate developer tried to disguise his voice (as if you could disguise that voice) and pretend to be his own publicist to dole out “news” tidbits he hoped local media outlets would pick up on, like, “Actresses just call to see if they can go out with him and things.” And let’s not forget that Trump launched his political career with the false insinuation that Barack Obama’s presidency was illegitimate because Obama wasn’t born in America.In the early days, Trump had real reporters to contend with—who saw through him and giggled over tapes of Trump masquerading as PR man John Miller or sometimes, John Barron. (Probably because it connotes both nobility and masculinity, Trump is obsessed with the name Barron. During his affair with Marla Maples, he reportedly sometimes referred to himself as “The Barron.” Being the classy guy that he is, Trump later bestowed that name on his youngest son, despite the sordid causes he’d employed it for in the past.)By the time of the Obama “birther” smears, Trump had a way of bypassing the skeptical, fact-based media. He’d found a new platform that was tailor-made for peddling his curdled snake oil: Fox News. Fox was the brainchild of Roger Ailes, a political operative who’d helped elect Richard Nixon, George H. W. Bush, and Ronald Regan. In Ailes’s mind, working directly for political campaigns just yielded short-term gains; to reshape America’s body politic, you had to play the long game: changing the information that people got and hence, changing the people.In 1992, Ailes told television journalist Charlie Rose, “If you want to have tremendous political influence and still be a womanizer, a drug abuser, or an alcoholic, you only have one choice of career, and that’s journalism.” Four years later, he co-founded Fox News as an outfit that would peddle right-wing narratives to viewers who felt they were losing something as America become more diverse and tolerant—and believed they were being mislead, ignored, or reviled by the established media outlets.Recent revelations of Ailes’ sexual harassment of female employees have shown that his blithe statement to Rose was a confession, but as often as he seized the opportunity to harass the women working at Fox, Ailes never lost sight of his most ambitious goal. Two years into Obama’s presidency, Ailes told Fox News executives, “I want to elect the next president.” He was driven out as Fox CEO by an avalanche of sexual harassment charges a few months before, but in November 2016, Ailes achieved his goal. Both defeated and triumphant, Ailes died on May 18, 2017. As someone who has fantasized about joining a class-action lawsuit of people who’ve lost loved ones to Fox brainwashing, the words that come to my mind are less “rest in peace,” more “I spit on your grave.”How Low Can He Go?“A downward spiral,” is how one Republican senator described the trajectory of Donald Trump’s administration lately. For me, it’s difficult to visualize a downward spiral for a presidency that began with a nihilistic rant about “American carnage” and a pathetically pointless (and easily disproven) boast about the size of his inauguration crowd. But I guess the spiral Senator Corker was alluding to began when the president fired the FBI director investigating Team Trump’s ties to Russia, accelerated with news that Trump leaked top-secret intelligence to the Russians, and has continued to pick up velocity with leaks from ex-FBI Director James Comey’s memos detailing Trump’s attempts to meddle in FBI investigations. I’d go a step further than “downward spiral”: Trump’s presidency has hit the ground, where it lies twitching like a dying bug. As befits a man who announced his candidacy for president by descending a golden escalator with his ex-model third wife and insinuating that Mexicans are rapists and drug-dealers, Trump’s downward spiral is a spectacle indeed. There’s his press secretary lurking among the White House shrubbery, demanding that all camera lights be turned off before he addresses the media in near-total darkness. And White House staffers blasting the volume on TVs so that other staffers’ shouts and bickering won’t be intelligible to the press hovering outside.I almost pity his spokespeople. Day after day, the only defenses those Trump mouthpieces have against a jaded, borderline jeering press are laughably transparent verbal dodges—which their boss will contradict a few hours later on Twitter. Then again, should we pity people who’ve sold any souls they may once have had to the devil? (I’d almost believe that Trump and the devil are one and the same, except they were both reportedly spotted at the same Playboy Mansion party back in the ‘80s.)True to Trump’s essential nature as a man who ruins everything, he makes it impossible for his many detractors to sit back and enjoy the operatic spectacle of his downfall. Yes, it’s bleakly amusing to watch the ogre-ish president and the malevelolent lickspittles who speak for him play out the psychodrama of their untenable situations. But Trump’s downfall is also wounding the country—and may wind up costing lives, both in America and abroad.For those of us who want to see this president go down, a turning point came when Trump revealed top-secret information to two emissaries from Vladimir Putin’s Russia: Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak (the latter a known spy). Inevitably, Trump’s hallmark vaudevillian flourishes were on full display. According to the White House’s own account, Trump told the Russians that the pesky FBI director he’d fired the day before is a “nut job”—and gloated that his departure would alleviate the pressure his administration was getting over its many-tentacle ties to Russia (of course, the opposite is true). And there was the White House’s incredibly naive decision to bar the U.S. press while allowing Russian media in—not to mention Team Trump’s shock and betrayal when those darn Ruskies made the photos public.The optics of those photographs didn’t look good, both literally and figuratively. There’s Trump and Kislyak yucking it up in the Oval Office—or maybe they were competing to see who had the most double chins. (As in the hand department, the U.S. leader once again came up short.) The most telling photo shows the three men together: Trump looking a bit bewildered and left out, the two Russians laughing giddily, locking eyes in a gaze that says, “Can you believe what this dope is doing for us? It’s more than we dreamed of when we got him elected!”The chilling part of that fever dream of presidential incompetence is that Trump—the self-described master player who gets outplayed by everyone he negotiates, meets, or rides an elevator with—shared top-secret information with a country that wants to do harm to America and its allies. And how long will those allies stay allies if they can’t trust the man in charge of the U.S. government? Not only might the country find itself increasingly isolated, it may be excluded from the kind of international intelligence-sharing that thwarts terrorists. The full ramifications of Trump’s disclosure are unclear, but they may include endangering the Israeli source of the leaked information, closing off a pipeline that might have yielded more intel on ISIS plots, even speeding up the execution of a plan to take down planes with explosive-packed laptops.The scenarios in which President Trump gets played have grown wearisomely familiar during the past few months. First, a Fox newscaster or one of his fellow dubiously elected authoritarian leaders transparently butters him up. (Exhibit A: Turkish President Erdogan congratulating Trump on “the legendary triumph he has garnered in the aftermath of the elections.”) Trump responds by smirking with unconcealable self-satisfaction, then gives his flatterers precisely what they want, whether it’s a whiff of legitimacy for their discredited government or a tweet shilling for their network.While it advances the nefarious plans of the Russians, Trump’s ineptitude is impeding those of the Republicans in Congress. The president’s myriad missteps have stalled his party’s push to cut healthcare for millions while providing tax bonanzas for the rich. And to roll back government protections for the environment and consumers—also to provide financial bonanzas for the rich. Despicable as those agenda items look to progressives and well, pretty much anyone, it might be possible to make a case for some of them by citing conservative doctrine. But Republicans’ willingness to look the other way while Trump dumps on the Constitution and undermines national security is indefensible. As Jeffrey Toobin wrote in The New Yorker, “It’s a certainty that history will look unkindly upon the moral blindness of contemporary Republicans.”“We generally do not want to have anything to do with this nonsense,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov observed of the Comey imbroglio. America feels the same way, Dmitry. But alas, it looks like things will get darker before the dawn finally breaks. And increasingly, that dawn looks like it will come in the form of the resignation, impeachment, or jailing of the man who is probably the most corrupt president the country has ever seen, and unarguably its most incompetent.Previously published as ‘Trumps Toys with the Presidency’ in Maria’s SPOTLIGHT column in The Wild Word magazine. www.thewildword.comFor more great Wild Word essays see:The Love Lessons I’ve Learned as a Stepfather by James PrenattLearning About Love At Grandma’s Table by Annie Mark-WestfallWhy Jesus Broke The ‘Billy Graham Rule’ by Reverend Rachel KesslerWhen Parenting Feels Like Drowning by Jami Ingledue"

Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.</em></p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/592394312000004900cb218e.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The 50th-anniversary remix version of the Beatles’ Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, conducted by Giles Martin and Sam Okell, is a revelation. This is a remarkable feat, given that the 2009 remasters would seem to have offered the last word on the Beatles’ catalogue. But what sets this new collection apart is a welcome sense of sonic separation and clarity that should establish a new standard for the Beatles’ long-playing masterworks.At first blush, the commemorative six-disc box set might seem extraneous. With the exception of such Holy Grail Beatles tracks as “Carnival of Light,” the 27-minute “Helter Skelter,” and the elusive “Etcetera,” many of the outtakes featured here have been circulating among avid collectors and audiophiles for years.But the real prizes here are the remixed tracks themselves from the original Sgt. Pepper album. To Martin and Okell’s great credit, the songs enjoy a renewed buoyancy and musical color. Astute listeners will feast their ears on the enhanced separation that elevates Ringo Starr’s drums, in particular, as well as the exquisite harmonies that adorn the album from top to bottom.If there are standout tracks to be identified from an album already renowned for its embarrassment of riches, then one need look (or listen?) no further than the aural triumph inherent in “Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,” with Martin and Okell’s careful panning treatment afforded to Paul McCartney’s Lowrey organ introduction. The effect is mesmerizing. And then there’s the shimmering beauty of Lennon and McCartney’s vocal performance on “She’s Leaving Home,” which Martin shifted a half-tone up in accordance with the latter’s longstanding intentions, as well as with the sound palette of the original mono recording. A similar effect is revealed on George Harrison’s “Within You Without You,” which comes to life in new and unexpected ways with the greater definition afforded to the song’s Hindustani instrumentation.Of particular note is the manner in which Starr’s drums move center stage in such tracks as “Good Morning Good Morning” and “A Day in the Life.” In both instances, his drum parts have been elevated within the mix, undergirding each song with a driving energy in keeping with the tracks’ larger musical ambitions.While the outtakes are welcome additions to the standard Beatles corpus of previously unreleased recordings, the signal gift of the six-disc box set is clearly the DVD version of the album in 5.1 surround sound. The DVD edition makes for the finest distillation of the remixes, affording listeners with a superior opportunity to experience the Beatles’ masterwork in all of its incredible aesthetic power and enduring beauty.In many ways, the DVD version of Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band offers the ultimate means for encountering the legendary album on the occasion of its 50th birthday celebration: as a singular, unbroken experience as one fabled track bleeds into another, finally punctuated by the climactic piano chord that brings the album to its crashing, unparalleled conclusion. Sgt. Pepper, for all of its overwhelming accolades and influence, is still as resilient and awe-inspiring as ever. But as the DVD helpfully reminds us, the album is best experienced—not by randomly sampling one track hither and yon—but as a seamless, uninterrupted whole. I’d love to turn you on, indeed.Ken Womack is an internationally renowned Beatles authority regarding the band’s enduring artistic influence. His latest book, Maximum Volume: The Life of Beatles Producer George Martin (The Early Years: 1926-1966), is forthcoming in 2017.

It’s estimated that the African-American community spends about $50 billion annually on travel and leisure with a large chunk of that spend coming from Black women. However, the travel industry spends very little marketing to the Black community in comparison to how aggressively they spend targeting white travelers, millennials, Baby Boomers, and other groups.The industry in general makes the assumption that Black people want the same experiences from a destination when we travel, and they usually miss the mark for our desire for cultural fit. Often times, Black travelers find themselves in travel experiences that are completely customized for the white consumer. We find subtle hints of this when we enter our hotel suites and find that even the shampoo doesn’t speak to who we are or that the main highlight at a resort is laying out poolside in the sun.As a viable and lucrative travel audience, it’s time to leverage this powerful spending power to influence and make demands of the industry that they put us top of mind. And having a multicultural department isn’t enough...especially when the department lacks true diversity among your senior leadership and creative team.All sectors of the travel industry should make the conscious decision to more authentically connect with the Black audience, and in particular, Black women since that’s who’s driving the bulk of the Black travel decisions and spend. For starters, the industry should spend more with Black media, and not just to appease these outlets with ads, but to create custom content and experiences that would resonate more deeply with their consumers. Ads in general market media could also use more diversity so that it speaks to more than one segment of America. Destinations also need to be more inviting, welcoming, and appreciative of Black culture in the same way that they’re vying for the booming Asian travel market. It’s also important that destinations customize their experiences to speak to us from a cultural perspective.Ultimately, the industry needs heads in beds, airline seats filled, resort activities fulfilled, and money spent in volumes by the Black community as Black travelers are among the last growth target for profitability. This is a call to the industry to take Black travel dollars more seriously and for Black travelers who have committed to discovering the world to demand that the industry as a whole finally recognizes our spending power and that they treat our dollars with more respect."
24,POLITICS,Oil Giant Shell Warns U.S. Not To Withdraw From Paris Accord On Climate,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/shell-paris-agreement_us_5922e848e4b094cdba55ba51,"“I cannot see where the upside is,” Royal Dutch Shell CEO says.",2017-05-22,"Ben van Beurden, chief executive officer of Royal Dutch Shell, is a vocal proponent of the Paris Agreement. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5922e934230000e815a6ae63.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Royal Dutch Shell has issued its starkest warning yet to the Trump administration to not pull out of the Paris Agreement addressing climate change.The Anglo-Dutch oil behemoth said withdrawing from the historic 2015 deal to cut greenhouse gas emissions “would be unhelpful on a number of fronts,” sacrificing diplomatic leverage in international trade deals and impeding U.S. companies. “What I think would happen as a consequence of [withdrawal] is that the U.S. would weaken its own hand by basically uninviting itself from a number of [negotiating] tables,” Shell CEO Ben van Beurden told the Financial Times in an interview published Monday morning. President Donald Trump vowed on the campaign trail to “cancel” the pact, signed by all but two countries. The White House is split on whether to move ahead with that promise, but sources told HuffPost earlier this month he is leaning toward withdrawal. He could announce a decision by next month, after the conclusion of a G7 summit of the world’s most industrialized democracies. U.S. departure from the Paris Agreement would weaken the accord, despite pledges by other countries, including China, to forge ahead, van Beurden said. “The U.S. has a major crop of companies that deliver technologies that are going to be relevant in the energy transition, and one way or another they will also find themselves probably more disadvantaged than advantaged by the U.S. pulling out” of the agreement, he said. “So I cannot see where the upside is.” Shell did not respond to a request from HuffPost for comment.Most Americans support the agreement, with 61 saying the U.S. should stay in the deal, while just 17 percent supported backing out, according to a HuffPost/YouGov poll taken last week. Even deposed Fox News pundit Bill O’Reilly urged Trump to keep the U.S. in the pact last November. Most major oil, gas and coal companies, including U.S. giant Exxon Mobil Corp., back the deal. So do a bevy of other corporate titans, such as Walmart, General Mills and DuPont. But Shell may be the pact’s most vocal proponent in the fossil fuel industry.And with good reason ― the company has money on the line. “With the U.S. being the largest investment destination for a company like Shell, yes, I think I would regret having a lot of business here that potentially could be at a disadvantage because of [the] implications of that decision to pull out’’ of the accord, van Beurden said. It takes years, sometimes decades, for oil and gas firms to yield profits on drilling exploration, and the White House has little effect on current investment decisions that van Beurden said would “probably only become economically relevant after the current president’s term.” But he said the company would consider drilling in the Atlantic Ocean, an area Trump reopened to offshore exploration with an executive order last month. Last December, President Barack Obama blocked offshore drilling in the Atlantic and the Arctic oceans with an executive order the Trump administration has since reversed. In 2015, Shell failed to find a big enough oil reserve in the waters off Alaska, and van Beurden said the company would not return to the region. “Arctic offshore? No. We’re done with that,” he said. “We had our episode there. We know what it takes, how difficult it can get.”Shell’s loud opposition to a U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement comes amid a growing fight at the United Nations over fossil fuel companies’ role in climate negotiations. Environmental groups and negotiators from developing countries most at risk from climate change proposed new rules on lobbying and conflicts of interest that could limit the corporate presence at the talks. Big companies cannot participate directly in the negotiations, but nearly 300 industry groups attended the talks this month in Bonn, Germany, potentially influencing the scope of regulations and agreements developed there.Proponents of the new guidelines cite the exclusion of cigarette companies from the global tobacco treaty that came to fruition in 2003. Fossil fuel firms play a much more critical role in the global economy than tobacco companies, so the situations are not perfectly analogous. Tobacco firms spent years undermining studies that linked smoking to lung cancer and other diseases, and negotiators disqualified the companies from joining treaty talks based on admissions that they covered up evidence. Shell publicly denied fossil fuels’ role in global warming for years, but a corporate film, published by a Dutch news site last February, showed that the company understood the link between burning oil and climate change as far back as 1991.Still, Shell has more of a stake in a low-carbon future than cigarette companies do in ending the smoking epidemic.“Successful outcomes of climate policymaking will have a big impact on the fossil fuel industry,” Tamar Lawrence-Samuel, international policy director at the watchdog group Corporate Accountability International, told HuffPost. “We have to be realistic and recognize that economies are largely dependent on the fossil fuel industry still.” "
25,POLITICS,Socialism Is So Hot Right Now. Thank Bernie Sanders.,Eliot Nelson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democratic-socialists-america-bernie-sanders_us_591dd25ee4b03b485caf9243,"You may not have heard of the Democratic Socialists of America, but the group is attracting a lot of young political talent.",2017-05-22,"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) speaks at a federal contract workers rally to celebrate Andrew Puzder's decision to withdraw from consideration to be secretary of labor on Feb. 16, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591dd3f1270000640090eb66.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Consider the Bernie Bro (Wellus actuallius), an aggressive subgenus of Sen. Bernie Sanders’ supporters.In the year since Sanders lost the Democratic primary, members of this species have been pushed out of their native habitat and forced to migrate to new ecosystems. Some nested down in social media, encroaching on classmates’ Facebook posts and female journalists’ Twitter updates with condescending diatribes about Slavoj Žižek. Others made their way to the hostile environs of Donald Trump’s campaign, finding sustenance in the idea that there was no difference between the Republican and Democratic nominees for president. Still more found their way to your dinner table, nourishing themselves on ponderous expositions of neoliberalism, where and how they refill their beer growlers, and why Bernie would’ve won. Herds of other Bernie Bros, however, have staked out a far more hospitable environment: the Democratic Socialists of America, or DSA. For the uninitiated, DSA ― the inheritor of the American Socialist Party, co-founded by Eugene Debs and instrumental in the progressive reforms of the early 20th century ― is a chapter-based national political advocacy organization that crusades for policies such as a higher minimum wage, safer working conditions and universal health care. DSA openly uses the big, bad, scary s-word that countless Republican consultants have used to smear Democrats over the years. And despite decades of efforts to stigmatize it, socialism is kind of in right now. This was partly fueled by Sanders’ underdog presidential campaign ― he identifies as a democratic socialist but caucuses with the Democrats in the Senate ― as well as by an economic recovery that has left many working people in the dust, experiencing a growing sense of disillusionment with the Democratic Party.“We were highly visible in the Sanders campaign,” Joseph Schwartz, a DSA national vice chair and professor of political science at Temple University in Philadelphia, told HuffPost. Schwartz said DSA’s growth began to accelerate as the Sanders campaign picked up steam in mid-2015, and has continued since Trump took office.DSA has rooted itself in the millennial psyche with astonishing speed. A quiz posted on Reductress earlier this month was titled, “Is He Into You, Just a Friend, or Trying to Get You to Join the Democratic Socialists?” Comedian Rob Delaney regularly promotes the group on social media. And that rose emoji you keep see popping up on Twitter? It’s likely a reference to both DSA’s logo and that of Socialist International, the global consortium of socialist organizations. Along with #resist and #NeverthelessShePersisted, the rose emoji has remained one of the more enduring social media trends since last November.“The real massive influx was starting with the day Trump was elected,” Schwartz recalled. “Many people want to fight back against Trump, but they also realize that the centrist, pro-corporatist views of the Democratic Party are partially what gave rise to him.”DSA officials say their member rolls shot up from around 8,500 on Election Day to about 21,000 as of early May, and they’re getting upwards of 10 requests a week to help open new chapters. New members are overwhelmingly young and tech-savvy, thanks in no small part to the groundwork the Sanders campaign laid by bringing millions of young people into politics.This engagement was on full display at a May Day rally in Washington, D.C., earlier this month. Around noon, some 100 or so activists from a variety of progressive organizations gathered in a small park in D.C.’s Mount Pleasant neighborhood. Making small talk near the obligatory drum circle were around 10 members of DSA’s D.C.-area chapter, nearly all of whom had signed up to join DSA on or after Election Day.DSA’s contingent was one of the largest on hand, but was nearly all white and male ― contrasting sharply with the rest of the crowd, which was far more diverse and representative of the neighborhood’s large Salvadoran community. The DSA attendees who spoke with HuffPost said they had joined DSA since November and were first drawn to it through the Sanders campaign.“Ever since Trump won, I think people have been feeling very scared and want to do something, and DSA is a great organization to channel that,” said Nick from Poughkeepsie, New York, who declined to give his last name. “I had an awakening during Sanders campaign. I was monitoring the growth of all these organizations and saw that DSA was gaining all these members and felt like DSA spoke to me.”James Mathias, 25, from northern Virginia, had previously volunteered for Barack Obama’s first presidential campaign and later participated in the Occupy Wall Street movement. After voting for Sanders in the 2016 primary, he voted for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the general election. While he wasn’t wild about Clinton’s policies, he felt compelled to vote for her out of political necessity, given Virginia’s swing state status.Mathias said political realism drew him to DSA and that he has yet to experience the organizational or political disappointment he did with Occupy and Obama.“Each time, I kind of drifted in and out, because both of those things petered out, either literally or philosophically,” Mathias recalled. “Occupy wasn’t focused on engaging with existing political structures. DSA is focused on building power for political ends. I really see a bias for action and not shying away from political structures.”Indeed, DSA doesn’t fashion itself as a vehicle for high-level political office ― most of its members who have run for office have run in municipal elections ― but rather as “America’s largest Socialist organization,” per its website. This isn’t a wishy-washy expression of being (The Socialist International was in our hearts all along!), but an acknowledgement that its foundational work is in lending organizational support to candidates from other parties and organizations whose policies align with its agenda.This includes other liberal advocacy organizations and economically progressive politicians like Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Sanders.DSA didn’t endorse Clinton in the 2016 general election, but its chapters actively organized a “Dump Trump” movement targeted at the Republican nominee. That left open the possibility of voting for Green Party nominee Jill Stein or even Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson, but DSA officials told HuffPost they expected a large number of their supporters would back Clinton.Despite DSA’s often antagonistic attitude toward the Democrats, Democratic officials say they’ll happily accept DSA’s support whenever it’s willing to offer it. “We welcome the help of groups across the country who are fighting to defeat Republicans and elect progressive leaders that stand for the same values that make our party so great,” DNC spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa told HuffPost in an email. While a membership of 21,000 is still small as political entities go ― progressive advocacy group MoveOn.org touts over 7 million members, for example ― DSA members’ engagement has caught the attention of the progressive community. They showed up in large numbers at May Day rallies across the country this year, including a New York City rally that attracted well over 1,000 DSA members. “The people who are joining DSA are people who are extremely active,” said Bob Master, a veteran labor activist and the co-founder and co-chair of the Working Families Party of New York. This gives the group tremendous leverage, Master said: Having a young, energized and tech-fluent base of volunteers is a welcome addition to any political coalition.DSA’s willingness to adapt to the current political framework and engage with other organizations has drawn plaudits from other progressive activist and organizations.“DSA has been an excellent ally, joining with our members in canvassing area businesses; they hosted a fundraiser party that raised $1,000 and helped us expand our operations,” said Hannah Kane, an organizer at Many Languages One Voice, a Washington, D.C., immigrant community group that led the May Day protest. “They’ve just been all-around excellent partners.”George Goehl, the co-director of People’s Action & People’s Action Institute, a Chicago-based advocacy organization, partly attributes DSA’s rise to “the Democratic Party and its constant tacking toward the middle and feeling like the answers to its problems lay in a more moderate, less-structural set of reforms.”“We failed in the last election because we had a candidate who was unable to tap into the anger that people are feeling,” echoed Master. “The Democratic Party cannot limit itself to saying ‘Trump is a bad guy because he fired James Comey.’ [It] has to speak to the growing sense of economic stagnation and diminishment.”Naturally, Democratic officials disagree with this assessment. Hinojosa, the DNC spokeswoman, said the party and its new chairman, Tom Perez, possess “an unwavering commitment to workers and will continue to fight for working families on behalf of the Democratic Party.”DSA naturally draws comparisons to the Green Party, a fact that is not lost on DSA members or leaders. But DSA officials see major differences between the organizations ― particularly in the Green Party’s complete separation from other political parties and what they see as the Greens’ inordinate focus on presidential elections.“We’re more flexible in terms of tactics,” said Schwartz. “We prioritize doing social movement work, and we see electoral politics as coming out of that.” The Green Party’s emphasis on its presidential tickets, he added, “is not an intelligent way to build an independent third party.”Green Party officials dispute that. In an email to HuffPost, Scott McLarty, media director for the Green Party of the United States, noted that “the Green Party runs hundreds of candidates for local and state office every election cycle.”“One of the main reasons we run presidential candidates is the support they give to state parties and to state and local candidates,” added McLarty.DSA has several challenges as its membership balloons, including what to do with all those new members. Although individuals unable to pay membership dues are still allowed to join, DSA relies on dues to maintain operations, which includes paying the salaries of the eight full-time employees in its national office. Right now, only two DSA chapters employ part-time employees, but DSA officials expect that number to grow considerably as large chapters in places like Los Angeles, Chicago and San Francisco continue to add members.Activists outside DSA also say it’s imperative that the group not lose focus on its overarching mission, or let the Democratic Party’s decidedly less-than-socialist views dilute its platform.DSA’s biennial convention in Chicago this August will be a major test of both its organization and focus. The group’s 2015 gathering in Baltimore featured roughly 150 attendees, but organizers expect this year’s convention to attract 500.Organizers hope to avoid what transpired at last year’s Green Party convention, which got so bogged down by ideological infighting and poor planning that it ultimately devolved into one giant lightbulb joke. “Managing growth is really hard, and when organizations grow, it’s hard to stick with your principles,” said Goehl. “A little too much power or access can pollute things.”An arguably greater challenge for DSA is diversifying its ranks and combating the growing impression that it is merely a refuge for wayward Bernie Bros. Indeed, most DSA members interviewed for this article were white men.DSA officials acknowledge that this overwhelming whiteness is inherently limiting. “We have to make space for diverse voices, including from immigrant communities,” said Schwartz. “If we don’t tackle things like mass incarceration, police brutality and the lack of economic opportunity for people of all races, we won’t unite working people.”In addition to promoting an agenda that it believes appeals to communities of color, DSA officials argue that the group’s focus on economic matters has the potential to appeal to female voters, who tend to back Democratic candidates and prioritize social welfare issues such as paid maternity leave and access to affordable health care.Julia Griffin is a 21-year-old DSA member from northern Virginia who works in the service industry and who attended the May Day rally in Washington. She said her Christian faith helped draw her to DSA; she sees in socialism a helping-thy-neighbor ethos that’s central to her religious beliefs.“After the election, I was so frustrated with the Democratic Party and so disappointed with everything that went on, I definitely needed to feel part of an organization that was actively working to make people’s lives better,” said Griffin. Ultimately, activists outside DSA say that if it wants to transcend its status as yet another outside group hoping to influence Democratic politics, it’ll need to establish itself as a real third party ― not only by notching some wins with local candidates, but also by enacting reforms once they take office.“If you’re attracting working-class and low-income members, you got to deliver some tangible victories,” said Goehl, of People’s Action & People’s Action Institute. He listed the establishment of local credit unions as an example of the type of policy reforms he believes locally-elected DSA members could achieve.“You can deliver a wide range of victories ― they can be electoral, they can be narrative, but they have to be tangible after a while,” Goehl added. “This is not theoretical to people; this is about having a place to live and having health care.” "

Congress actually doesn’t have to get involved, as a president is successfully inpeached after someone (anyone) simply imposes a photo of the politician on a photo of a peach to make it appear that said politician is trapped inside said peach.And that is what has happened: The president of the United States has been inpeached.These last few months have been the pits, so it’s understandable if you have fuzzy feelings about this decision ― despite what the inpeachment process may mean for this country.During his campaign, our current president was like, “Knock, knock,” and the country was like, “Who’s there?” to which he responded, “Orange,” and most of us were like, “That seems bad,” and then he said something like, “Orange you glad I have a banana?” and that seemed really bad, but then some of our roommates let Orange in anyway. He hasn’t been a great houseguest, and now it’s just fun to be like, “WELL, ORANGE YOU GLAD WE INPEACHED YOU?”Fruit humor!"

It is responsible for addresses in Wards 3, 4, 8 and 9. The city allotted $25 million for the project in total.Rhonda’s husband, Jeff Gayer, serves as the project manager. He told TNJ that about 800 waterlines have been replaces so far and he hopes to have 6,000 replaced by the end of 2017.“Our company is usually the only African American-owned business to respond to request for proposals for various Flint city contracts even now after the court rulings related to the water crisis,” he said. “This is a major project that will ensure public safety and start rebuilding trust between the city and the community ... something that has been missing awhile.”He said the goal is to “have all 18,000 lead-corroded residential pipes replaced by December 2019.”The company has hired about 20 staff members, including ex-offenders and young people, and a video team to document the piping being replaced. Grayer said she’s following the example her late dad and founder of the company set for making a positive impact on the community.“I will tell you that it is really exciting and the most important part of it is the opportunity to employ people who may not have had other opportunities,” she told The HUB Flint.It’s been more than three years since the city’s water crisis began. In April 2014, Governor Rick Snyder and other politicians moved to change Flint’s water source from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department to the Flint River without properly treating the water or checking it for toxins.Thousands of children and adults became sick in the predominately black city due to lead poisoning. A drinking water expert said there was a “very strong likelihood” that water from the river led to the “dramatic” increase in cases of a severe form of pneumonia that killed at least 10 people.Though the water quality has improved recently and a federal judge approved the $97 million settlement, residents’ health and livelihoods are still at stake.

He is accused of taking three hostages at a Tampa Palms smoke shop, according to a copy of the police report. After police talked Arthurs into surrendering, he made references to “Allah Mohammed” and said, “I had to do it. This wouldn’t have had to happen if your country didn’t bomb my country,” Tampa police reported. Arthurs is a U.S. citizen.When an officer asked Arthurs if anyone was hurt, he reportedly replied, “The people in the apartment, but they ain’t hurt, they’re dead … they’re definitely dead.”Authorities say Arthurs then led investigators to his New Tampa apartment, where they found the bullet-riddled bodies of his roommates, 18-year-old Andrew Oneschuk and 22-year-old Jeremy Himmelman.Police said Arthurs told them he shot his roommates because they’d been “disrespecting Arthurs’ Muslim faith” and that all three of them “had been friends with a common neo-Nazi belief until Arthurs converted.”In addition to the victims’ bodies, investigators found bomb-making materials and white supremacist propaganda, according to federal documents obtained by The Tampa Bay Times. Those items were reportedly linked to a fourth roommate, identified as Brandon Russell, who is in the Army National Guard.Russell called himself a national socialist and member of a white supremacy group, police said. He has been charged with possessing an unregistered destructive device and unlawful storage of explosive material.Authorities have not accused Oneschuk and Himmelman of being involved in any illicit activities. It’s also unclear if they were neo-Nazis, as claimed by Arthurs. Himmelman’s sister, Lyssa Himmelman, told The Tampa Bay Times that her brother and Oneschuk had only recently moved to Florida from Massachusetts. She also said both men had been planning to leave because they disagreed with Arthurs’ views.“Jeremy was a sweet, funny, amazing, loving brother who would never hurt a fly,” Lyssa Himmelman said. “He thought this was his friend who would never hurt him, and he betrayed him.”Arthurs said he’d only recently decided to kill his roommates, according to the Tampa police report, which says:“Arthurs stated he has become angered by the world’s anti-Muslim sentiment and had wanted to bring attention to his cause. Arthurs also stated that, prior to the murder, he had been privy to neo-Nazi internet chat sites threatening to kill people, and he had developed a thinking that he should take some of the neo-Nazis with him.”Arthurs faces two counts of first-degree murder, two counts of aggravated assault and three counts of armed kidnapping. He is being held without bond at the Hillsborough County Jail pending a Wednesday morning court hearing.David Lohr covers crime and missing persons. Tips? Feedback?

Rachel Spencer, a confidence and success coach, recently posted two photos of herself to Instagram. In one picture, she is 13 years old in a swimsuit, covering her stomach for the camera. In a present day picture, the 26-year-old is happier and more confident, identifying herself as a “self-love queen.” “I’ve been sitting here trying to think of a good caption but this photo just makes me sad when I look at it,” she wrote in an Instagram caption. “So how about I ask you a question: Who taught the young girl on the left to hide her tummy before taking pictures in a swimsuit? Who taught her that at only 13 years old, her chubby little body was unworthy of a photographic memory?” Spencer said the reason she hid her body was because of boys who bullied and teased her about her weight. Over the years, she also felt pressured by images and messaging in the media about things like cellulite and dieting. But thanks to a little time and some self love, she’s in a super positive place thirteen years later ― and she has a message for people who need to get to that place. “I have a message for all the women who are much older and STILL feel ashamed to show their tummy at the pool: Don’t be,” Spencer said. “Put on that bikini and smile. Don’t feel the need to let other people’s opinions ruin precious memories with your friends and family. Show your daughters what it’s like to flaunt their flaws at the pool. No shame. Your imperfections tell a story. Your body is beautiful. You are BEAUTIFUL.” Amen to that. The HuffPost Lifestyle newsletter will make you happier and healthier, one email at a time. Sign up here."
35,POLITICS,Amnesia In Riyadh: A Reply To President Trump's Speech On Extremism,"Karima Bennoune, ContributorProfessor of Law",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amnesia-in-riyadh-a-reply-to-president-trumps-speech_us_59227068e4b07617ae4cbd9b,The most shocking aspect of President Trump’s speech – perhaps except for the singling out of Iran ― was the lack of shocking language.,2017-05-22,"<p>Tunisian Intellectuals Conference Against Terrorism, Tunis, August 12, 2015</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5922708f1600002900ddc0df.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I dare President Trump to give the same speech he delivered Sunday at the Arab Islamic American Summit to his own followers at his next rally in the United States. To say in Ohio: “We must practice tolerance and respect for each other again.” To tell Alabamans that the majority of victims of terrorism have been people of Muslim heritage and that this “deadliest toll” has been “a tragedy of epic proportions.” To celebrate here at home the possibilities of the “bonds of friendship, security, culture and commerce” between Muslims and Americans. To declare for middle America that “this is not a battle between different faiths.” To call for God to bless Muslim majority countries and the United States of America in the same breath, as he did at the end of his address, at the next CPAC.Doing so would be a real contribution to the global struggle against all forms of extremism, including far-right extremism in the West, and much-needed proof he actually meant what he said in Riyadh. It could also help defuse some of the hate violence and vitriol targeting people of Muslim heritage living in the U.S. that his strikingly different campaign rhetoric helped fuel. He should take seriously First Daughter Ivanka Trump’s otherwise hollow call at the Tweep summit for “a future of tolerance.”The most shocking aspect of President Trump’s speech – perhaps except for the singling out of Iran ― was the lack of shocking language. As Fox News noted, the President “toned down the rhetoric.” What a difference a teleprompter makes. But one is left wondering if the president believes that everyone – at home and around the world ― has had a sudden and irreversible attack of amnesia. In the commentary leading up to this first trip abroad, there was much talk in the media of the rather large elephant in Sunday’s lavish meeting room – his advocacy of travel bans on people from a number of Muslim majority countries and his view that “Islam [seemingly a person] hates us.”What stays with me, however, is a tweet from February, shocking even by Trumpian standards ― in which he claimed that “supporting Muslims is supporting female genitalia mutilation.” (sic) Has he changed his mind? In Riyadh, he expressed admiration for Saudi efforts to improve the status of women ― without noting that women still could not have driven themselves to any of his events. Which of the two diametrically opposed views about Islam and Muslims that he has expressed in the space of four months does he believe? If he stands by all of what he said in Saudi Arabia, he must apologize for and disown many of his previous statements about these topics.As an American of Muslim Arab heritage who has worked against extremism for 25 years, I am actually glad the president called for terrorists to be driven out of Muslim places of worship and for Muslim majority countries to “do what it takes to destroy the terror that threatens the world.” Like many others from the same background, I agree with the sentiment he expressed about Islamism, if not the sci-fi tinged rhetoric he used to do so, when he suggested Muslims must send this “wicked ideology into oblivion.” Critics of the president should not make the mistake of discounting the importance of that message regardless of the messenger. The metastasizing of Islamism from Indonesia to Libya and beyond is indeed a threat to “the futures of many generations.”However, I cannot see how such calls from a man who has never atoned for repeatedly expressing deeply anti-Muslim views can possibly advance these causes at the popular level. Many governments in these regions may strategically forgive the U.S. president in exchange for his willingness to tolerate their human rights abuses, but ordinary people and especially the 65 percent under the age of 30 whom he highlighted are unlikely to do so.Moreover, as expressed by Zuriani Zonneveld, Malaysian-American founder of Muslims for Progressive Values, “Trump is making the same mistake as Obama. They keep pumping money into the very institutions and so-called partners that are the root of terrorism.” She wonders if the new Terrorist Financing Targeting Center the U.S. is co-chairing with Saudi Arabia will do anything to halt the funding of radical imams that her organization has been attempting to counter with its “pitifully funded” #Imamsforshe initiative. Why not support and enable the real opponents of terrorism for once, rather than standing with its historic funders?A key theme of the speech was that “the nations of the Middle East cannot wait for American power to crush this enemy for them.” This is dangerous revisionist history. As I wrote in September 2014 after President Obama’s speech to the UN General Assembly, similarly calling on Muslims to tackle the Islamism he declined to name, many people of Muslim heritage are out in front of the American president. They have been putting their lives on the line for years to confront that ideology, from Afghanistan to Mali. My own father did this in his native Algeria in the 1990s. Like him, liberal, secular, moderate, left-wing and feminist advocates in Muslim majority countries – not enough of them, but significant nonetheless ― have for decades been calling on the world to understand the danger they were facing and stand with them. Today, they include imprisoned Saudi blogger Raif Badawi. Instead of receiving international solidarity, just as we witnessed again in Riyadh, this crucial constituency watched the United States support the archaic Gulf monarchies that exported Wahhabism to all Muslim majority regions with their petrodollars while squashing opposition to fundamentalism at home.King Salman said that President Trump’s speech is one the whole world will remember. That will only be true if Mr. Trump takes his own message seriously, and if we collectively tackle the hate his rhetoric has spawned here at home, while thoughtfully addressing the complex realities he addressed abroad."
36,IMPACT,Reaching Zero Human Rabies Deaths,"Louise Taylor, ContributorScientific Director, Global Alliance for Rabies Control",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/reaching-zero-human-rabies-deaths_us_591f2809e4b07617ae4cbb8f,"So that leaves vaccinating dogs. Break the cycle of transmission in dogs, eliminate the rabies virus and everyone is protected",2017-05-22,<p>Vaccination immediately after a bite prevents rabies from developing</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591f2c242000001700cb1a33.jpg?ops=crop_0_0_500_311%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Rabies from dogs has been killing people for centuries, even millennia. It’s been that way for so long that in many countries it was just accepted that there was no practical solution.We’ve had safe and effective vaccines that could deal with the problem for decades, but something else has changed in the last few years. Evidence has been building that the elimination of rabies from dogs is a feasible objective. Even in those areas where it was once assumed impossible there is now good evidence that the horrific deaths that rabies causes can be dramatically reduced.Then in late 2015, rabies experts from around the globe met in Geneva and launched an ambitious vision: zero human deaths from dog-mediated rabies by 2030. They agreed that “the time is now!”, to set a goal that the global rabies community can organise behind, and that endemic countries can aspire to. As Margaret Chan, director general of the WHO said in her opening address “Rabies belongs in the history books. This event will help put it there.” So, if we really are serious about this goal, what are our options? Most rabies endemic countries have enacted some or all of the three main approaches to preventing humans from dying:1. Mass culling of dogs2. Protecting people with vaccination after a dog bite (Post Exposure Prophylaxis, or PEP)3. Mass vaccination of dogsTime is short and money is always limited. Where do we put our money to reach this goal the fastest?We can immediately discount the first option. Although sadly still quite common, killing piles of dogs simply doesn’t work. Time and time again a temporary reduction in the dog population is followed by the dog population rising, and rabies spreads once more. Worse still it is usually a disaster for community relations. Pet dogs are killed, guard dogs are killed, people hide their dogs or transport them away from culling teams, and this can spread rabies further afield. If there were any vaccinated dogs, these are also killed and as the population rebounds there is a fresh supply of rabies-susceptible dogs to spread the disease. After this kind of experience, the community is, with good reason, very suspicious of future rabies control attempts.What about protecting people with PEP? This makes sense – we want to stop people dying, we should vaccinate them. Since only people who are bitten or scratched by a rabid animal develop the disease we can focus just on that subpopulation, which helps to reduce costs. There is no doubt that the human rabies vaccine is one of the best we have, and it saves lives – maybe 2.9 million a year. But there are practical challenges. The vaccine needs to be widely accessible and affordable, and at $40-60 for the vaccine and the health care system to deliver it to each bite patient, it is expensive for governments to provide. A lot of people get bitten by dogs – most of them were not truly exposed to rabies, but whilst rabies runs rampant through the dog population, we can’t risk waiting to see what happens before starting PEP. Rabies is almost 100% fatal and vaccination must start very soon after the bite occurs to be sure it will be effective. Huge strides have been made in making PEP available in many Asian countries, but the bills are high. In China, an estimated 15 million people are treated at a cost of nearly $650 million each year. Using human vaccination alone, these costs will continue indefinitely.So that leaves vaccinating dogs. Break the cycle of transmission in dogs, eliminate the rabies virus and everyone is protected – people, dogs, wildlife. Vaccinating dogs protects those bite victims who can access PEP and those who can’t. This method has its hurdles too of course – there are an estimated 536 million dogs in rabies endemic countries where veterinary services are generally woefully under-funded and dog health is not a priority. But it is time for some imagination – for co-operation and cost-sharing between the ministries of health that benefit from the lives saved and the ministries of agriculture or animal husbandry who could be the vital animal vaccination providers. Unlike delivering PEP which is a medical urgency, regular annual mass dog vaccination has the advantage that it can be planned ahead.Wherever we have good animal and human data for rabies, cases in humans follow cases in animals closely. If rabies rises in animals, more people die, almost irrespective of how much PEP is supplied. A fraction of people, sometimes large and sometimes small, but always from the poorest sectors of society, still cannot access PEP. Allow me one graph, one that convinces me more than any other:In Sri Lanka, the human rabies cases (black line) have fallen as animal vaccination (dark blue bars) has risen, and were far less affected by provision of human PEP (lighter blue bars). Rabies is an animal disease. We need PEP to protect people from the risk of rabies in the short term, but vaccinating dogs until the virus is eliminated is the only long term answer. I challenge every canine rabies endemic country to draw this graph with their own data and see what combination of efforts works best for them.So is reaching the 2030 goal possible? Yes. We have all the tools and the know how to eliminate canine rabies for good.Is it feasible? Yes. We have the proof of concept and the international community is ready to support countries in their efforts to build the necessary capacity.Will it be done? That mainly depends on generating enough political will to make it a reality.See www.endrabiesnow.org and www.rabiesalliance.org for more infomration about efforts to end deaths from rabies. #EndRabiesNow This article is part HuffPost’s Project Zero campaign, a yearlong series on neglected tropical diseases and efforts to eliminate them.

We hear so much about the importance of inclusion and PIFF has got it right.“We are extremely proud of the fact that 50% of the narrative films in the Provincetown Film Festival this year are directed by women! This marks a record high for the festival and we cannot wait to present this exciting slate of new work, especially in a year where we're honoring two fiercely talented women: Sofia Coppola and Chloë Sevigny.” Says PIFF Artistic Director, Lisa Viola. It is so important to celebrate the success of women filmmakers and I had the pleasure of talking to Academy Award-nominated and Golden Globe-winning actress Chloë Sevigny about not only being honored with the PIFF Excellence In Acting Award but also her short film entry “Kitty.” “I’m really looking forward to being back in Ptown and seeing if it has changed much, I used to visit the Cape a lot with my parents” Chloë told me “and I remember Ptown being such an arty place.” Kitty is Chloë’s directorial debut, the story is about a little girl whose nickname is Kitty, she begins to grow cat like features, which no one recognizes, until she is transformed into a cat. Chloë wrote the script, based upon the short story of the same name by Paul Bowles. “Kitty has a lot to do with internalizing, about wanting to be something she’s not. I want people to see the depth of the story, about feeling remorse. I drew inspiration for it after the loss of my father.” Chloë explained. As a first-time film director did you find it hard getting support?“I made a point of surrounding myself with people who had more experience, mainly women and that really helped. I find I communicate better with women” Chloë said “although Seamus McGarvery, our DP was incredible, he taught me so much and gave me more confidence.” What was the hardest part in making the film?“Kitty definitely had its filming challenges, with intimidating special effects. But the hardest part was the editing and deciding what to cut.”Would you like to do more directing and would you consider acting and directing?“Yes, depending upon the material but I would want to get more experience as a director before taking on acting in a film I was directing.”You’re receiving the Excellence in Acting Award, you’ve played some diverse characters over the years, are there any stand out roles for you?“There are so many, Jennie in Kids, Alice in The Last Days of Disco, Jean in American Psycho and I’ve been so lucky to have worked with some great directors.”What makes you chose a role?“I believe in the power of an original voice and authenticity.”Chloë will be attending the Provincetown International Film Festival and she will be receiving her award on June 17th, for more information please visit Exellence In Acting AwardThere are so many reasons women should be heading down to Ptown to celebrate women in film at PIFF and the residents are happy about the influx. PIFF is an important part of life for PTown local’s, it brings great attention to this beautiful artisan town on the tip of Cape Cod in Massachusetts.“Movies matter - to us and to Provincetown.” Explains Ptown local, Ilene Mitnick “So much so, we immediately became year-round sponsors of the Prov Film Society. Exec Director Christine Walker and her team do so much to elevate Provincetown and the cinema-loving lifestyle throughout the year.” “The Film Fest is one of our favorite weeks.” Allison Baldwin continues “We fill our B&B with film-lovers, sometimes filmmakers and, if we’re lucky we sneak away to plunge into an inspired and colorful spectrum of precisely chosen films.”Laurie Hart, Massachusetts based screenwriter and producer says “I’m excited to see this years line-up filled with women in front and behind the camera. Hollywood should never underestimate the strength of a woman!”PIFF has an incredibly diverse line up of films, one of which being Goddess written and directed by Karishma Dube, who is an Indian filmmaker now based in New York and she had this to say about her film and women in film.“Goddess is definitely inspired by my lived experiences. I have always been confused by how familial our relationship with our domestic help is in India. The film intends to examine class and sexuality within a contemporary Indian family setting- one where social standing and tradition means everything, and individuality and western influence are both shunned and revered in the same breath. It portrays an unconventional family of three women - Tara, a young feisty teenager, her proud single mother and their protective house hold maid. In the short film, Tara begins to risk family and her social boundaries as she pursues her attraction towards their household maid, Devi.”“I think it's so exciting to be a woman filmmaker today, but I'm also braced with a certain sense of responsibility that comes with it. There is a responsibility to portray women in a way that challenges the assumptions people usually have from these characters.

This month, nearly 40 years later, World Health Organization (WHO) members will elect a new Director-General. This person is the chief architect of policies with vital implications on community health and can lead the way toward health for all. In Africa specifically, the best way to achieve this universal health goal is through community health workers.Right now, many Africans don’t have access to essential care and medicine and there is limited or no fully deployed primary health care system in most African cities. Reasons why include limited domestic funding for health care as well as limited innovation in how Africans access health care under a national health insurance scheme. Furthermore, about 50 percent of Africans depend on the private sector, but donor-funded programs do not direct their funding or provide access to capital.Community health workers can play an important role for health for all in Africa. They sustain health gains and prevent health challenges by being active in both rural and urban areas. They are present in the last mile where it is usually the hardest to reach those in need. They are trained on promoting good health and hygiene in the community as well as on diseases’ prevention for infants, children and adults.In 1976, one of Africa’s pioneers in believing in community health workers was a young Kenyan doctor named Dr. Miriam Were. She developed a process where local people worked with their neighbors to promote healthy behavior and tackle diseases. She demonstrated that health promotion and disease prevention norms were developing in the community as a result. In the same year, Dr. Pascoal Mocumbi, a health minister in war-torn Mozambique, designed a successful program to train nurses to perform obstetric surgery in rural areas where there were no facilities for them to find help.Since then, many countries have neglected the impact and have not provided an adequate policy framework for community efforts and instead built a greater reliance on development assistance for specific diseases at the cost of a holistic health approach. This is not the direction we should go. Africa’s health journey started in the community and to the community is where we must return. Community health workers are the best way to stop preventable and curable diseases early enough to save lives.We have examples of community programs that work – we just need more of them. One is OneFamilyHealth, a public private partnership with the Government of Rwanda operating 106 heath posts, and 60 per cent are run by women. Since its inception in 2011, more than 1.3 million patients have been served. Euphrasie Mukanturo, a nurse, runs one of these health posts. As a community health worker in Bumbogo, she diagnoses, treats and provides prevention support to about 30 patients a day. Each of them are enrolled in the national health insurance scheme, the government’s pillar to achieve cost-effective universal coverage.Another example is the work done by Last Mile Health in Liberia. Liberians are being trained to diagnose common medical issues and perform interventions. To deliver on the promise, their CEO Raj Panjabi is using technology to allow for multi-stakeholders to learn, exchange and make a difference up to the last mile.No matter where they are located, technology is key to the success of community health workers. If they are isolated without access to technology, they can not be as effective. For instance, e-health allows for the creation of a network of community health workers who can share information and gain referrals, and, as a result, save more lives.When people speak about community health, they may only think about rural areas and assume that cities are fine. But urban areas and their slums also have health challenges. Alexandra, Kibera and Makoko, for instance, host some of the 200 million (2014) Africans who migrated to city slums looking for a better future. This other half will benefit from integrated health systems supported by technology for health tracking purposes. Africa’s middle class and slum dwellers deserve equal access to quality healthcare.Healthcare is the oil that will keep the wheels of socioeconomic transformation moving forward, so how do we fund a better system?The African middle-class can donate money, skills and time to assist NGOs and other institutions working in health, particularly those working with community health workers. African private sector employees can give support through volunteering and offering skills programs. Lastly, tax authorities can factor the social and economic value of tax reforms by easing collection, widening the base and most importantly offering tax incentives for individuals investing in enabling sectors, such as health.While the WHO election is important, Africans must also focus on funding more community health workers who can help Africans and address the health challenges that erode the lives and aspirations of millions. New catalytic investments in people, physical and virtual infrastructure as well as technology are required to finally help us keep the promise made 39 years ago and achieve health care for all.Carl Manlan is an Ivorian economist and COO of the Ecobank Foundation.

39,WORLD NEWS,Egyptian Human Rights Defender Mohamed Zaree Faces Court on Wednesday,"Brian Dooley, ContributorSenior Advisor, Human Rights First",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/egyptian-human-rights-defender-mohamed-zaree-faces_us_59230582e4b07617ae4cbe13,"The latest installment in Egypt’s long-running judicial harassment of civil society is due on Wednesday. Mohamed Zaree, Egypt",2017-05-22,<p>Mohamed Zaree of the Cairo Institute for Human Rights.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/592305a62000001b00cb1f71.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The latest installment in Egypt’s long-running judicial harassment of civil society is due on Wednesday. Mohamed Zaree, Egypt Director of the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies (CIHRS) has been summoned to appear before an investigative judge that day in the notorious 173/2011 case, commonly known as the “NGO foreign funding case.”The Cairo Institute is one of the world’s leading NGOs, with a long-established national and international reputation for expert, effective advocacy. It’s one of 37 NGOs now targeted in Egypt in the 173/2011 case. Nine months ago a court ordered the freezing of the NGO’s assets.Zaree himself has been banned for leaving the country but the authorities for a year now, and Wednesday’s questioning will be another impediment to his work. “I’m worried that the investigation could lead to prison, but it’s also wasting our time when we should be working on more important things,” he told me. “Human rights violations are more serious and worse here than ever, and our work is really needed to convey the voice of the victims. By punishing us they are punishing the victims twice. In a country facing security and terrorist threats, respecting human rights isn’t optional, it isn’t a luxury. It’s vital to maintaining security and stability. The state should concentrate on combating terrorism, not combatting freedoms.”The government of President Al Sisi has mounted a relentless attack on Egypt’s civil society, and Zaree is one of dozens of leading Egyptian activists who is banned from leaving the country. Others, including Mozn Hassan, Founder and Executive Director of Nazra for Feminist Studies, have also had their assets frozen. “Zaree is a strong passionate activist who inspires me with his strength in struggling for our rights as civil society continues our struggle,” said Hassan. She’s also been targeted in the foreign funding case.Zaree’s work at the Cairo Institute in increasingly recognized outside the country, and he is one of he 2017 finalists for the prestigious Martin Ennals Human Rights Defender Award. He’s known as a consensus leader with Egyptian society too, and co-ordinates the decade-old Forum of Independent Egyptian Human Rights NGOs.A persistent critic of repression in Egypt, Zaree is an obvious target for the regime, and Wednesday’s hearing is serious. In September 2014, President Al-Sisi signed into law amendments to Article 78 of the Penal Code which include the provision that receiving foreign funding for the purpose of “harming national security” is punishable by life imprisonment.President Trump’s hosting of Al-Sisi at the White House last month offered little prospect of the new United State administration urging its military ally to reform and to respect human rights. “I just want to let everybody know, in case there was any doubt, that we are very much behind President al-Sisi,” said Trump. “He's done a fantastic job in a very difficult situation. And I just want to say to you, Mr. President, that you have a great friend and ally in the United States and in me.”Trump’s election victory is widely reported on Egyptian state media as a renormalization of relations with Washington after the aberration of the Obama presidency, which sometimes criticized Al-Sisi’s human rights abuses. Al-Sisi’s remarks at the White House pointedly noted that “this is my first state visit to the United States since my inauguration in office. And, as a matter of fact, this is the first visit in eight years from an Egyptian president to the United States.” Trump’s reassurance that “we’re going to be friends for a long, long period of time” offers little prospect that the U.S. administration is going to encourage Egypt from the path of suffocating its civil society."
40,WOMEN,Why We Need To Stop Shaming 'Resting Bitch Face',"Barbara DiGangi, ContributorSocial Impact Strategist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/beyond-rbf-the-sexism-behind-shaming-women-when-they_us_5922ec09e4b0b28a33f62dfa,Women who are socially selective and empowered shouldn't be made objects of sexist scorn,2017-05-22,<p>Some of Beyonce’s inner circle at her Carter Push Party.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59233a5e1600002500ddc2fe.jpg?ops=crop_0_0_800_664%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Beyonce, looking like a goddess more than ever, hosted her Carter Push Party last weekend. While most are on the edge of our seats waiting for double the BEYbies, others were concerned with the less important details ― who attended the party and who did not. This invasive scrutiny of celebrity squads and their social life plays out in the everyday lives of women and girls everywhere. What no one talks about is how not only do we get sexist flak for having a Resting Bitch Face (RBF), but we also catch the same kind of criticism for being socially selective.Maybe Resting Bitch Life should be a thing. As you recall, women are told both explicitly and implicitly from a young age that they should smile, sit pretty, people-please, ensure the boys find them attractive, stay small... the list goes on. These ingrained sexist messages account for that guy on the street or that guy in the bar telling a woman to fix her RBF and smile, as if she owes it to him. Then, it also accounts for the verbal lashing a woman gets if she rejects that man’s wishes. In fact, even women feed the patriarchy unknowingly when they turn to a girlfriend sporting a RBF and ask, “are you mad at me?” or, “why are you so cold?”If you look closely, you’ll find an extension of the RBF problem as women navigate social situations and find their tribe. A variation of the aforementioned messages and interactions is embedded in response to choices we make when it comes to our social life and friendships. And that’s shaming women for being socially selective, which is when a person mindfully chooses who they spend their time with. As if yet another choice of ours is governed by society. As if we need another situation in which our “no” is not accepted and respected as a full sentence.As much as women need to empower and support each other daily, women must also be able to say no in their social life. If they want to be happy and healthy, that is. They need to be able to say no to toxic and one-sided relationships. They need to be able to say no to men and women who don’t align with their own values, goals, and lifestyle. They need to be able to say no to social invitations in order to be out doing what the world needs them to do: kick ass. And, especially in 2017, they need to say no to those who “deny our humanity and right to exist” as Linda Sarsour, organizer of the Women’s March, tweeted.When exercising these “nos,” women are often shamed or called names for their decisions to not associate with someone whose friendship would cause them to sacrifice some part of themselves. Women also get the same reaction when life demands a shift in priorities and alignment that alters their social life. We see media coverage feed this shaming, rooted in sexism, when we read stories about Kim and Beyonce and Kelly Ripa and Regis Philbin, for example. We are told more than once that Beyonce is “cold” to Kim when they couldn’t be more different (which may account for Beyonce setting her boundaries). Moreover, Kelly Ripa reunited, lovingly, with Regis only for him to state that Kelly hasn’t spoken to him (even if she hadn’t uhm, maybe she’s busy?).This is a conversation that needs to be changed as we step toward strengthening the self-worth of women. The pressure to be nice ― to people-please ― results in women putting the needs and feelings of others before their own, which is often neither healthy nor empowering. This pressure and the messages behind it need to be unlearned. Women weren’t born to be martyrs and yet, many women feel obligated to stay in social circles that drain them versus uplift them. Many women feel they just “have to” socialize with the Ivanka in their life simply because they don’t want to stir the pot.When we talk about women’s rights and our choices, we’re also talking about having the freedom to set our own boundaries. Boundaries are what keep us emotionally and mentally healthy. Freedom is the ability to live by our own standards, rules, and happiness ― not by those others have defined for us. This is why, for example, it’s so disturbing to hear Offred tell Mrs. Castillo in “The Handmaid’s Tale” that she’s happy when she’s anything but. The expectation for women to constantly smile, be with a certain crowd, and fit into the box society has defined for us, infringes on our right to decide what we feel is healthy for us and what we feel isn’t. As Anna Lind Thomas put it : “ life is too short for crappy friends.” It is clear that the most powerful and inspiring women are who they are because they use discretion in their social lives. Oftentimes the most empowering thing we can do for women is hold space for them to say no and set a healthy boundary. We need to ensure women give themselves permission to balance being friendly with their right to choose their tribe.Maybe then, more women will feel free to go live the life they want and deserve."

For authenticity, the restaurant’s owners had to import ingredients like Skippy peanut butter and Philadelphia cream cheese.

The outrage about the lack of the taco emoji was such a Bay Area thing—like it is inconceivable to us that we could lack representation of things that are central to our specific experience.”“I identify as Chinese and Chinese American,” she added. “And as a Chinese American, I don’t really feel like we deserve a fortune cookie.

43,POLITICS,DOJ Admits It Can't Actually Take Away Federal Grants From Most 'Sanctuary' Cities,Elise Foley and Ryan J. Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sanctuary-cities-jeff-sessions_us_59234853e4b03b485cb4131a,"But Jeff Sessions says the Justice Department may ""tailor grants to promote a lawful system of immigration.""",2017-05-22,"President Donald Trump speaks with Attorney General Jeff Sessions on the West Lawn of the U.S. Capitol on May 15, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/592348bc2000004700cb2090.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― After months of bluster about taking away federal law enforcement grants from jurisdictions that don’t fully cooperate with deportation efforts, the U.S. Department of Justice acknowledged on Monday what legal experts have said for months: In most cases, the department can’t do that. Attorney General Jeff Sessions released a memo explaining how the department will carry out President Donald Trump’s executive order meant to crack down on so-called “sanctuary cities,” defining them more narrowly than before.“Sanctuary city” is a broad term, but is most often applied to jurisdictions that don’t comply with all of Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s “detainer” requests to hold individuals who would otherwise be released. Yet instead of going after any city or county that doesn’t comply with ICE’s requests, the executive order will target jurisdictions that specifically don’t comply with a law to share information with the federal government for immigration purposes. It’s an important distinction ― nearly all jurisdictions, even those labeled sanctuary cities, say they do comply with the law to provide information. If that’s the case, Trump’s anti-sanctuary cities order is largely toothless.For all of the president’s rhetoric, the Trump administration is now admitting it can only take away funding under narrow circumstances, and not just because jurisdictions are declining to do what ICE asks.The administration has a good reason to do so: A federal judge temporarily blocked Trump’s executive order in April, ruling that it could violate the Constitution if applied broadly, based on its vague wording. In a memo released on Monday, Sessions wrote that the term “sanctuary jurisdictions” used in the executive order refers only to jurisdictions that “willfully refuse” to comply with 8 U.S.C. 1373 ― which simply says that jurisdictions “may not prohibit, or in any way restrict, any government entity or official from sending to, or receiving from, the Immigration and Naturalization Service information regarding the citizenship or immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of any individual.” The law does not require jurisdictions to proactively disclose immigration information or to hold immigrants on ICE’s behalf. The memo isn’t a shift, exactly. In court and statements to press, the Justice Department has said that it’s not illegal for jurisdictions to decline detainers. But coming from Sessions, it’s significant: The attorney general has repeatedly suggested it is illegal and promised a crackdown. Although jurisdictions might not lose federal grants for immigration policies the Trump administration doesn’t like, they’ll still face pressure to change course. Sessions wrote in his memo that the administration will continue to pressure those jurisdictions into compliance in other ways. “While the Executive Order’s definition of ‘sanctuary jurisdiction’ is narrow, nothing in the Executive Order limits the Department’s ability to point out ways that state and local jurisdictions are undermining our lawful system of immigration or to take enforcement action where state or local practices violate federal laws, regulations, or grant conditions,” Sessions wrote.Sessions also seemingly suggested that the Justice Department could create future grants designed specifically to encourage jurisdictions to work proactively with federal authorities, or perhaps prioritize grants for jurisdictions that go above and beyond what the law requires.“Separate and apart from the Executive Order, statutes may authorize the Department to tailor grants or to impose additional conditions on grantees to advance the Department’s law enforcement priorities. Consistent with this authority, over the years, the Department has tailored grants to focus on, among other things, homeland security, violent crime (including drug and gang activity), and domestic violence,” Sessions wrote. “Going forward, the Department, where authorized, may seek to tailor grants to promote a lawful system of immigration.”For James Williams, county counsel for Santa Clara County, California, one of several localities fighting Trump’s sanctuary cities executive order in federal court, Sessions’ new memorandum doesn’t fix the deeper problems with his department’s directives.“This memo from Attorney General Jeff Sessions does nothing to address the constitutional infirmities at the heart of this Executive Order,” said Williams, whose legal team won a national injunction against the executive order last month. “To the contrary, it shows that the Department of Justice continues to scramble to find a way to save an Executive Order that is unconstitutional on its face and cannot be lawfully implemented.”Read the full memo below.Cristian Farias contributed reporting."

Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) said Sunday he wants every single note the White House has on President Donald Trump’s meeting with Russian officials in the Oval Office earlier this month.In the past week, multiple damning reports have emerged regarding what was discussed during Trump’s May 10 meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak, which was closed to U.S. press. Lawmakers expressed frustration that they only learned of notes documenting what was said in the meeting from media reports, and struggled to catch up to one scandal before another surfaced. “I want every note that they have,” Cummings, ranking member on the House Oversight Committee, said on ABC’s “This Week.” “There have been so many lies, so many contradictions. And I think documents will help us to ferret out exactly what’s the truth and what’s a lie.”Cummings added that he hopes Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) will “issue subpoenas so that we can get every document.” The clock is ticking for Chaffetz, who has announced he will resign at the end of June.Chaffetz appeared alongside Cummings on Sunday, saying he doesn’t even know if there are documents on the president’s meeting, or if the memos that fired FBI Director James Comey reportedly kept on his conversations with Trump do indeed exist. “I don’t know where they reside. I don’t know if there are documents,” Chaffetz said. “But we’re certainly pursuing them. And if they’re there, I hope we find them and get them sooner rather than later.”Chaffetz added that he expects to speak with Comey on Monday. The former FBI director has agreed to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee sometime after lawmakers’ weeklong break for Memorial Day. After his interview with “This Week,” Cummings released a draft subpoena that he urged Chaffetz to sign and send to the White House. “The White House is obstructing our investigation on the Oversight Committee, covering up for General Flynn, and refusing to produce a single document that Chairman Chaffetz and I asked for in a bipartisan letter two months ago,” Cummings said in a statement. “I have prepared a subpoena that the chairman could sign today. If he does not want to do that, we ask that he allow the committee members to vote on it.”"

If he’s serious about turning a new leaf, he should start in his own backyard.Nowhere on the planet will you find a more diverse and representative population of Muslims than in the United States. Muslims have been a part of this nation’s fabric since before its founding. We are as diverse in language, race, culture, and socioeconomic status as our country itself. In terms of national origin, we are a majority minority population, with African-Americans representing the single largest group of believers.And yet, President Trump has decided to deliver his speech in Saudi Arabia, one of the most homogenous, ideologically rigid, and socially repressive countries imaginable. By choosing Saudi, either by intention or not, he is sending a message to the world that they are the best representatives of the billion and a half adherents of Islam. His actions also serve as an endorsement that Saudi’s interpretation of Islam, which declares itself the only brand worth following, is the one Americans back home should also consider the gold standard. And without a hint of irony, by partnering with the Kingdom to “promote a moderate view of Islam and combat extremism”, while continuing to marginalize and alienate Muslims back home, President Trump will dramatically exasperate and only undermine his own stated goals.Though Saudi has made marginal attempts in recent years to moderate its image and enact more progressive social policies (with the bar set so abysmally low), it is hardly a paragon of virtue. Its track record on women’s rights and treatment of religious and ethnic minorities fly in the face of the true Islamic values of defending human rights of society’s most vulnerable and establishing a clear separation of church and state to protect religious liberty for all. Saudi Arabia does not speak for American Muslims, and President Trump does not speak to us either.Here in the United States, the only engagement we’ve seen thus far from the Trump administration has been xenophobic rhetoric, discriminatory policies that tear Muslim families apart, and the active nurturing of a new environment where bigots feel free to commit hate crimes against our community in record numbers.In 2015, during the most toxic campaign season in recent memory, hate crimes against Muslims rose by a staggering 67%. The FBI’s numbers for last year haven’t been released yet, but every estimate indicates an even greater spike. And that’s just from what little data actually gets reported. In a joint advocacy effort with Emgage USA last month, MPAC joined with the ADL and Senators Kamala Harris and Marco Rubio to pass a Senate resolution condemning the spike in hate crimes and calling on the Department of Justice to improve its scattershot collection of hate crime reporting from law enforcement agencies nationwide. Our message was clear: anti-Semitism and Islamophobia are two sides of the same bigoted coin, and both Jews and Muslims have seen an unprecedented wave of attacks against our communities. If President Trump is serious about building bridges with the Muslim community, actually addressing this scourge would be a pretty good place to start.Furthermore, the notion that Saudi Arabia should be the first partner to turn to in the fight against radicalization and extremism is laughable at best and deeply disturbing at worst. Muslim communities in the United States have been leading the way in amplifying authentic, positive narratives that directly combat the type of binary worldview foreign groups like ISIS try to promote. Often, and perhaps most effectively, this is done without involvement of the federal government. We firmly believe it should stay that way but, at the same time, the administration and Congress would do well to acknowledge the work our leaders do on a daily basis to promote a pluralistic -and ultimately more authentic- embodiment of our faith. Instead, the Muslim community is far too often singled out for suspicion, alienation, and a questioning of our loyalty. President Trump may know something about this after spending years trying to question the religion and national origin of our previous President.By choosing Saudi Arabia as the platform for his overture to Muslims, President Trump will do nothing to heal these wounds within his own nation. Instead, he will only further cement the idea that Islam is foreign, that the “Muslim world” is fundamentally different and alien to our own nation and the bedrock principles upon which it was founded. Trump’s message is still being delivered in a way that reinforces the idea that it’s a partnership of strangers who share little in common. This, ultimately, is the very same narrative ISIS itself feeds on and, incidentally, the one that the alt-right also relishes in promoting. Both ISIS and Islamophobes want you to believe that Muslims cannot exist or lead meaningful lives in the West, and here in the US in particular.And so we say again to our President: Don’t fly across the world to build bridges. The work must start at home."

Now The World Needs To Unclench Its Fist.","Reza Marashi, ContributorResearch Director, National Iranian American Council",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/iran-election_us_5921ca0ce4b03b485cb24817,"The president's re-election presents an opportunity to reduce the diplomacy deficit, particularly with the U.S., Israel and Saudi Arabia.",2017-05-21,"Supporters of Rouhani celebrate after the results of the Iran vote were announced. Tehran, Iran. May 20.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5921cbf2230000eb15a6acad.jpeg?cache=Kl4l8ZhVWP&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In a region rife with wars, occupation and a distinct lack of democratic freedoms, Iranian voters overwhelmingly re-elected pragmatist President Hassan Rouhani to a second four-year term. They did so knowing that fulfilling their long-standing political, economic and social aspirations will be a marathon, not a sprint. To that end, their willingness to double down on Rouhani demonstrates savvy, strategic patience on domestic and foreign policy. Not coincidentally, the two are interconnected. This begs the question: what do the election results mean on a global scale? Five key issues highlight the implications.First, Rouhani’s vision for addressing Iranian society’s top priority – alleviating economic malaise – will require another four-year diplomatic charm offensive. His team wants investment, job creation and managerial development to boost the middle class and promote equality – all of which requires improved foreign relations. It is therefore not surprising that Rouhani said he would work to lift all sanctions in his second term. Doing so, however, will be no small task. Washington unilaterally imposes the vast majority of remaining sanctions, and U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has shown little inclination to engage Iran diplomatically.This stands in contrast to the majority of the world, which remains eager to improve diplomatic and economic ties with Tehran. The European Union, Russia and China, among others, congratulated Rouhani on his victory and called for continued cooperation on all fronts. America instead called on Iran to affirm free speech – during a joint press conference with the Saudi government, which has long repressed free expression. Trump appears unlikely to reciprocate Rouhani’s diplomatic overtures, thereby causing American policy preferences to diverge from European, Russian and Asian interests. It remains to be seen if Washington can block their economic pursuits.However, it is more difficult to isolate Iran when its president is calling for constructive engagement with the world. This is particularly true in the context of the Iran nuclear deal. If Rouhani lost the presidency to hardliners, they would have likely matched Trump’s hostility toward the agreement, thereby causing it to erode due to negligence.Instead, Rouhani, Europe, Russia and China remain locked in to the nuclear deal. Only America is not fully living up to its end of the bargain. This is not sustainable over the long run, and Iran’s continued nuclear deal compliance during Rouhani’s second term will force Trump to choose: fix sanctions-related complications hampering implementation; encounter countries that seek to weaken U.S. control of the international financial system; or kill the deal and isolate America.In addition to Trump’s America, there are two other countries that will continue to form an Axis of Rejection in response to Rouhani’s foreign policy. One is Saudi Arabia. Despite Tehran’s repeated outreach, Riyadh has refused to respond in kind. During Trump’s state visit to the kingdom, the quid pro quo offered by Saudi leaders was straightforward: “We invest billions in the U.S. economy, you take on Iran for us.” Even if Saudi-Iran relations continue to deteriorate over the next four years, Rouhani will ensure that Tehran’s offer to negotiate remains on the table because his team has long acknowledged what the Saudis are unwilling or unable to: zero-sum policies benefit no one, and no country can truly be a regional power unless its neighbors are willing to accept its power.The third chief Rouhani rejectionist is Israel. To be clear, Iran’s president has no plans for formal diplomatic outreach to Tel Aviv. He has, however, helped usher in a policy shift predicated on greater restraint. For example, when Israel bombarded Gaza in 2014, Rouhani was relatively silent and disengaged compared to his predecessor. More recently, he openly criticized the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps for painting anti-Israel slogans on missiles. Such efforts will likely continue during his second term. While Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government refuses to acknowledge Rouhani’s restraint, Israeli defense officials have privately conceded as much to me on numerous occasions.All of the aforementioned complications in relations between Tehran and its rivals in Washington, Riyadh and Tel Aviv manifest most deeply in Syria. As a disastrous proxy war continues to kill and displace millions, the costs steadily increase for all sides. In his second term, Rouhani’s preference is to negotiate a power-sharing arrangement that stops the killing. He may be able to convince more skeptical Iranian stakeholders to accept a Syria in which Assad is no longer head of state if the Axis of Rejection relaxes its position and agrees to two compromises: Syria’s security apparatus remains largely intact, and any opposition members and groups must be mutually vetted and agreed upon by foreign powers at the negotiating table.Rouhani’s re-election presents a tremendous opportunity on a global scale to double down on dialogue and reduce the diplomacy deficit. His team knows there is no other way to fully accomplish its domestic economic objectives. They are therefore clear-eyed about the challenge ahead: a variety of deep geopolitical disagreements remain intact, none of which can be solved overnight. However, Rouhani’s track record demonstrates that sustained engagement can lower tensions and produce peaceful solutions to conflict. By electing him to a second term, Iran has once again extended its hand. It remains to be seen if the world will unclench its fist. "

Today’s major street protests in Budapest were the latest in a series of massive demonstrations against Orbán’s latest moves against NGOs and the Central European University (CEU).Yesterday saw large anti-corruption protests in his home village of Felcsut, and this evening thousands of people marched in the country’s capital to demonstrate against the government and in solidarity with CEU and NGOs. The dissent seems to be gathering series momentum very quickly. One of today’s protestors, Balint Pinczes, explained: “When your values are under attack, when liberty and democracy are under attack, you’ve got to get out there. And of course, we’re here for the sheer fun of it as well.”Orbán’s ruling Fidesz Party predictably dismissed the protests as the work of a “network” of George Soros, the Hungarian-American philanthropist, founder of the CEU and a supporter Hungarian NGOs. But the scapegoating of Soros is wearing thin as public anger grows.The Budapest rally follows weeks of international condemnation. Last week, two United Nations Special Rapporteurs condemned legislation backed by the Hungarian government to restrict the activities of NGOs. The draft “Bill on the Transparency of Organisations Financed from Abroad” would have a “chilling effect” on legitimate scrutiny of the government, said the UN experts, and called on the government to withdraw the legislation.“Certain public remarks by Prime Minister Orbán and other high-ranking government officials on the activities of civil society raise serious concerns about the government’s commitment to basic freedoms in a democratic society,” said the UN experts. “We urge the government to withdraw the bill and to provide a safe and enabling environment for civil society organizations both in practice and rhetoric, in line with their international human rights obligations.” Last week Members of the European Parliament censured Orbán’s government, easily passing a resolution (by 393 votes to 221 with 64 abstentions) that condemned a “serious deterioration of the rule of law, democracy, and fundamental rights.” It cited the attempted closure of the CEU and called for a process that could ultimately lead to EU sanctions against Budapest. “The situation in Hungary justifies the triggering of the procedure which may result in sanctions for Hungary,” MEPs said in the resolution, and called for the controversial laws to be suspended or withdrawn.The resolution listed a catalogue of MEP concerns, including “freedom of expression, academic freedom, the human rights of migrants, asylum seekers and refugees, freedom of assembly and association, restrictions and obstructions to the activities of civil society organizations, the right to equal treatment, the rights of people belonging to minorities, including Roma, Jews and LGBTI people, social rights, the functioning of the constitutional system, the independence of the judiciary and of other institutions and many worrying allegations of corruption and conflicts of interest, which, taken together, could represent an emerging systemic threat to the rule of law in this Member State.”Today’s protests come a week before the deadline for responses to the government’s biased “Let’s Stop Brussels!” national survey questions.The national consultation features anti-immigration questions, and question 4 asks:“More and more foreign-supported organizations operate in Hungary with the aim of interfering in the internal affairs of our country in an opaque manner. These organizations could jeopardize our independence. What do you think Hungary should do? (a) Require them to register, revealing the objectives of their activities and the sources of their finances. (b) Allow them to continue their risky activities without any supervision.”The consultation suggests the government is confident of public support. But it looks like the famously astute Orbán may be overreaching. The internal and international response to his latest moves is mounting. Budapest is seeing its largest anti-government protests in years; the EU and the UN are openly questioning Orbán’s direction and judgment. With Hungarian general elections less than a year away, it looks like Orbán might be finally losing his political touch."

Engineers are now designing plans to shore up protections at the storage facility.The vault has been described as the “Noah’s Ark” of seeds and a last chance for the world to regenerate if the worst happens. Built into a hillside in the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard, it was established in 2008 as a fail-safe protection for food sources and stores packets of dried and frozen seeds from around the world that can last hundreds of years. Officials chose the location because they believed the permafrost there was permanent. But in a worrying sign that world-threatening change may be inescapable anywhere on the planet, the permafrost melted for the first time in recorded history.The melting occurred during the recent extraordinarily warm Arctic winter but, since the facility was designed to require little monitoring and is unstaffed, officials just discovered it. Now the Norwegian government, which owns the vault, and Statsbygg, the agency that runs the facility, will closely monitor it for threats from climate change. “It was not in our plans to think that the permafrost would not be there and that it would experience extreme weather like that,” Statsbygg spokeswoman Hege Njaa Aschim told The Guardian. “It was supposed to [operate] without the help of humans, but now we are watching the seed vault 24 hours a day.”Workers used pumps to remove the standing water and will waterproof walls and build drainage ditches to deal with runoff from melting permafrost.Statsbygg is now also tasked with tracking the state of the permafrost on Svalbard.CORRECTION: A previous version of this article’s headline said the vault was in Antarctica. It is in the Arctic. "

Their perception ― that the focus on Clinton’s emails overshadowed the rest of her campaign ― is backed by data, according to an analysis recently released by researchers at Gallup, Georgetown University, and the University of Michigan. The results don’t directly address the share of media coverage focused on Clinton’s emails, or the degree to which it hurt her standing, but they make it clear that much of what the public remembered hearing about her was focused on the controversy.“Email-related scandals clearly dominated recalled words about Clinton. This is true for almost every week of the campaign,” the authors concluded in a presentation given Saturday during a panel on election surveys. “There was no similarly common theme for Trump, whose multiple scandals produced a changing, and perhaps more easily overcome, narrative during the campaign.”During last year’s election, the polling firm Gallup regularly asked Americans if they’d read, heard, or seen anything about the presidential candidates in the last few days. Those who had ― usually two-thirds or more of the public in any given week ― were asked to elaborate.The researchers then pulled out the words used by the public to describe what they were hearing about both candidates, as part of an effort to figure out what information was reaching voters and staying with them.In a chart of the most common words used in relation to Clinton between last summer and Election Day, the word “email” quite literally crowds out the rest, with several of the other most prevalent words also alluding to perceptions that she was scandal-plagued. “Health,” another relatively common word, likely refers to the coverage of Clinton’s collapse at a 9/11 memorial event, which was caught on camera. Her campaign later released a statement saying she had pneumonia.Clinton’s performance in the presidential debates also attracted attention, as did some of her speeches. But words that reflect her campaign’s messaging or policy positions appear relatively scarce, suggesting her platform wasn’t at the top of most Americans’ minds.“Because [what Americans recalled] was primarily about the emails, it didn’t leave, relatively speaking, very much room for the issues,” Michael Traugott, a political scientist at the University of Michigan, said Saturday.That held true for virtually the length of the general election. With the exception of the presidential debates and her bout with pneumonia, “email” was among the most cited words for Clinton in every week leading up to the election.Many of the words surrounding Donald Trump also related to unflattering stories ― “women,” for example, which likely encompasses everything from his litany of demeaning comments about women to the accusations he faced late in the campaign of sexual harassment and assault. But no one topic completely dominated the public’s impressions of him or his campaign. The predominant conversations about Trump fluctuated throughout the campaign, encompassing his choice of Mike Pence as a running mate and his comments on immigration. Toward the end of the campaign, attention seemed to shift largely to his treatment of women.Most of the words used to describe Trump weren’t exactly policy-focused either. But more so than Clinton, Trump apparently managed to focus public attention on at least some of his campaign rhetoric, specifically on immigration. That squares with a pre-election HuffPost/YouGov survey, which found that Americans perceived Trump’s campaign as focused on immigration, and Clinton’s campaign as being largely about the personal qualities of both candidates. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Republicans and Democrats consumed and remembered starkly different information about the candidates, according to the Gallup data. While Democrats were paying attention to Trump’s comments about women and marginalized groups, Republicans focused more on his attitudes toward immigration and his pledges to “make America great again.”If the prominence of the word “speech” is any indication, much of what they heard about Trump came directly from the candidate himself. Cable television networks like Fox, CNN and MSNBC regularly aired Trump’s campaign speeches in their entirety during last year’s election ― in one case, as The New York Times’ Michael Grynbaum noted, skipping Clinton’s speech to a workers’ union in order to “broadcast a live feed of an empty podium in North Dakota, on a stage where Mr. Trump was about to speak.”Most of the attention to Clinton’s emails came from Republicans, who perceived her more generally as dishonest and scandal-plagued. Democrats’ impressions of Clinton, while not centered around any particular topic, were far more neutral, and included interest in topics like her economic proposals."

Tyrants and curmudgeons",2017-05-21,"<p>Too many people succumb to the mistaken belief that being likeable comes from natural traits that belong only to a lucky few. Dr. Travis Bradberry explains how being likeable is under your control, with strategies that you can start using today.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591c79af1e00001700623836.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If you want to be a leader whom people follow with absolute conviction, you have to be a likeable leader. Tyrants and curmudgeons with brilliant vision can command a reluctant following for a time, but it never lasts. They burn people out before they ever get to see what anyone is truly capable of.When I speak to smaller audiences, I often ask them to describe the best and worst leaders they have ever worked for. People inevitably ignore innate characteristics (intelligence, extraversion, attractiveness, and so on) and instead focus on qualities that are completely under the leader’s control, such as approachability, humility, and positivity.These words, and others like them, describe leaders who are skilled in emotional intelligence. TalentSmart research data from more than a million people shows that leaders who possess these qualities aren’t just highly likeable, they outperform those who don’t possess them by a large margin.Becoming a more likeable leader is completely under your control, and it’s a matter of emotional intelligence (EQ). Unlike innate, fixed characteristics, such as your intelligence (IQ), EQ is a flexible skill that you can improve with effort.What follows are 10 key behaviors that emotionally intelligent leaders engage in that make them so likeable.1. They Form Personal ConnectionsEven in a crowded room, likeable leaders make people feel like they’re having a one-on-one conversation, as if they’re the only person in the room that matters. And, for that moment, they are. Likeable leaders communicate on a very personal, emotional level. They never forget that there’s a flesh-and-blood human being standing in front of them.2. They’re ApproachableYou know those people who only have time for you if you can do something for them? Likeable leaders truly believe that everyone, regardless of rank or ability, is worth their time and attention. They make everyone feel valuable because they believe that everyone is valuable.3. They’re HumbleFew things kill likeability as quickly as arrogance. Likeable leaders don’t act as though they’re better than you because they don’t think that they’re better than you. Rather than being a source of prestige, they see their leadership position as bringing them additional accountability for serving those who follow them.4. They’re PositiveLikeable leaders always maintain a positive outlook, and this shows in how they describe things. They don’t have to give a presentation to the board of directors; they get to share their vision and ideas with the board. They don’t have to go on a plant tour; they get to meet and visit with the people who make their company’s products. They don’t even have to diet; they get to experience the benefits of eating healthfully. Even in undeniably negative situations, likeable leaders emanate an enthusiastic hope for the future, a confidence that they can help make tomorrow better than today.5. They’re Even-KeeledWhen it comes to their own accomplishments and failures, likeable leaders take things in stride. They don’t toot their own horns, nor do they get rattled when they blow it. They savor success without letting it go to their heads, and they readily acknowledge failure without getting mired in it. They learn from both and move on.6. They’re GenerousWe’ve all worked for someone who constantly holds something back, whether it’s knowledge or resources. They act as if they’re afraid you’ll outshine them if they give you access to everything you need to do your job. Likeable leaders are unfailingly generous with whom they know, what they know, and the resources they have access to. They want you to do well more than anything else because they understand that this is their job as a leader and because they’re confident enough to never worry that your success might make them look bad. In fact, they believe that your success is their success.7. They Demonstrate IntegrityLikeable leaders inspire trust and admiration through their actions, not just their words. Many leaders say that integrity is important to them, but likeable leaders walk their talk by demonstrating integrity every day. Even a leader who oozes charm won’t be likeable if that charm isn’t backed by a solid foundation of integrity.8. They Read People Like A BookLikeable leaders know how to read people as unspoken communication is often more important than the words people say. They note facial expressions, body language, and tone of voice in order to get what’s really going on with their people. In other words, they have high social awareness, a critical EQ skill.9. They Appreciate PotentialRobert Brault said, “Charisma is not so much getting people to like you as getting people to like themselves when you’re around.” Likeable leaders not only see the best in their people, but they also make sure that everyone else sees it too. They draw out people’s talents so that everyone is bettering themselves and the work at hand.10. They Have SubstanceDaniel Quinn said, “Charisma only wins people’s attention. Once you have their attention, you have to have something to tell them.” Likeable leaders understand that their knowledge and expertise are critical to the success of everyone who follows them. Therefore, they regularly connect with people to share their substance (as opposed to superficial small talk). Likeable leaders don’t puff themselves up or pretend to be something they’re not, because they don’t have to. They have substance, and they share it with their people.Bringing It All TogetherLikeability isn’t a birthright; it results from acquirable skills that are crucial to your professional success. And just like any other professional skills, you can study the people who have them, copy what works, and adapt them to your own style. Try these ten strategies and watch your likeability soar.What qualities describe the best and worst bosses that you’ve ever worked for?

The missile fired a week ago flew was liquid-fueled, and flew further.North Korea has defied all calls to rein in its nuclear and missile programs, even from China, its lone major ally, saying the weapons are needed for legitimate self-defense.The reclusive state has been working to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of striking the U.S. mainland. On Saturday, it said it had developed the capability to strike the U.S. mainland, although Western missile experts say the claim is exaggerated.The United Nations Security Council is due to meet on Tuesday behind closed doors to discuss the latest test at the request of the United States, Japan and South Korea, diplomats said on Sunday.An official traveling with U.S. President Donald Trump in Saudi Arabia said the White House was aware of the latest launch and noted that the missile had a shorter range than the three previous missiles that North Korea had tested.U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said economic and diplomatic pressure would continue to be applied to North Korea.“The ongoing testing is disappointing, disturbing and we ask that they cease that,” he said in an interview with “Fox News Sunday”.The two missile tests in a week complicate plans by South Korea’s new President Moon Jae-in to seek ways to reduce tension on the peninsula. Moon took office eleven days ago after winning an election on a platform of a more moderate approach to the North, with which the South is still technically at war since no peace treaty was signed at the end of their 1950-1953 conflict.South Korea’s foreign ministry said the tests were “reckless and irresponsible actions throwing cold water over the hopes and desires of this new government and the international community for denuclearization and peace on the Korean peninsula”.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the latest missile test by the reclusive North was “a snub and a challenge to international efforts for a peaceful resolution”.Abe told reporters after a meeting of Japan’s National Security Council that he wanted to raise the issue of North Korean missile launches at the Group of Seven leaders’ summit in Italy this month. China had no immediate comment.RIVAL TEAMSKim Dong-yub, a military expert at Kyungnam University’s Institute for Far Eastern Studies in Seoul, said the North appeared to be testing and perfecting both solid and liquid-fueled missiles, which might help explain why the pace of its tests had increased.“I think the team to develop liquid fuel missiles are being pitted against the solid fuel team,” Kim said. “The liquid fuel team succeeded on May 14 so the solid fuel team went for another round to achieve success. That is why the speed of North Korea’s missile development is going beyond imagination.”Sunday’s missile was launched at 0759 GMT (3:59 a.m. ET) from a location near Pukchang, 60 km (36 miles) northeast of the capital Pyongyang, an area where North Korea attempted to test-launch another missile last month but failed, South Korea’s Office of Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement.The missile flew about 500 km (310 miles), it said. Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said the missile landed outside Japan’s exclusive economic zone and no damage to ships or airplanes was reported.“The flight range was 500 km and South Korea and the United States are closely analyzing additional information,” South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said.On Saturday, North Korea’s KCNA state news agency said in a commentary: “The U.S. mainland and the Pacific operational theater are within the strike range of the DPRK and the DPRK has all kinds of powerful means for annihilating retaliatory strike.” North Korea’s full name is the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK).For a graphic on North Korea missile launch, click http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/NORTHKOREA-MISSILES/0100417Z2NK/NORTHKOREA-MISSILES.jpg(Additional reporting by Tetsushi Kajimoto and Tim Kelly in Tokyo, Jeff Mason in Riyadh and Michele Nichols at the United Nations; Writing by Raju Gopalakrishnan; Editing by Peter Graff and Sandra Maler)"

This is a letter to you because you’ve been making me sad lately. I don’t want you to think that you are anything less than the star that you are because you’ve been treating yourself in a way that I just don’t think you should be.Sometimes as friends we joke that we “hate ourselves,” but it is only that—a joke. Maybe we drank too much one night or we said something dumb that we maybe should not have and that is why we “hate ourselves”—just silly small regrets or funny situations we got ourselves into, but when I start to see you get upset over other things like boys or get anxious about the future, I worry.Sometimes it’s hard for you to picture yourself as someone that can do incredible things because there are so many people around you that have everything figured out. That doesn’t mean that there aren’t millions of people that don’t have it figured out yet either. The pressures of the world and the feeling of possibly suffocating under this pressure of pleasing everyone in your life with life decisions about your future are exhausting and stress inducing.What I really want to say to you is this: no one has it figured out. No one ever has everything figured out. Some people are better at hiding it than others, but life is unpredictable (something I know you know all too well) and even if we have a plan, 10/10 times the plan will be altered and tailored to who you are at every stage in your life.I don’t want you stressing about your future because a gem of a friend such as you will always have a bright future. Will there be crappy people and unfortunate circumstances encountered every day in the future? Yes, definitely. However, surrounding yourself with the positive and wonderful people you have in your life will ensure a bright future.You’ve got a support system—not many people can say that. You have people in your life who care about your future and will give advice and pull strings where and when they can to see you succeed. And you will succeed—you’ve got to believe it because we all believe in you. I believe in you.Now, we have to talk about boys because, as your best friend, I am obligated to tell you that you don’t need a man to validate your existence or make you feel special/wanted/etc. It is my obligation to tell you that; it’s my job to remind you of this whenever you need it. However, for me, it is not just a task that must be done. I have strong conviction in this statement because I know you so well and I know boys are not a necessity for happiness.It is up to us to create our own happiness. There are influences on our happiness, of course, but these influences should not be so strong that we lose sight of ourselves and how important we are in the lives of others—especially to each other. I will support every decision you make, regardless of how absolutely stupid it might be. And we both know you make extremely stupid decisions, but if I don’t support you, who will? I might not support your decisions, but I support you.It is disheartening for me to watch you choose some of the losers that you do because you deserve the world and you don’t see it. You don’t see how much you are worth.You are worth so much more than a continuous cycle of heartbreak and insult.You are worth more than a loser who can’t commit to your imperfect perfection and your sometimes-subtle crazy.You are worth more than a guy who will break up with you at the most inconsiderate of times. You are worth more than a guy who refuses to understand your intricate and complicated wants and needs and decides to neglect them regardless.You are worthy of a guy who sees you for who you really are and if he sees what I see, he will love you with his whole heart. He will see that you are impeccably unique and that you have a rare perspective on life.As I said, it makes me sad to think you don’t see all of this; you are worthy of so much more than you give yourself credit for and so much more than the guys you’ve chosen.What I want for you is immeasurable happiness; I want you to wake up every morning knowing you have so many people that love and support you and that you are worth more than you always thought. There’s someone out there for you, but you need to love yourself first and learn how to make yourself the happiest you can be.Sometimes it feels like the world is spinning, but you’re stuck in reverse. Maybe it looks like everyone is going forward and you’re going backwards, but what everyone sprinting forward doesn’t see is that you’re just strolling in a different direction, taking in the sights and observing your surroundings before sprinting into a lifestyle you are unsure of.I think what I am trying to say to you is that you are okay. Life is happening and you need to hang in there and know that people love you. If you find someone you care for and he doesn’t love you too, lose him. Shake off the negativity in your life and know that you have so much time and so many more decisions to make in the future that will have positive impacts on you. You just have to get rid of negativity and wait and see what happens.Bestie, don’t settle for anything less than what equals the absolute treasure that you are.Love you.Sincerely,Me"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59209b932300003400a6abea.jpeg?cache=UTFYmB9mdH&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The king of Saudi Arabia told President Donald Trump on Saturday that he’s optimistic about the U.S. leader’s ability to broker peace between Israelis and Palestinians, according to Saudi Foreign Minister Adel Al-Jubeir.At a press conference alongside Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Jubeir said Trump and King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud had a “very, very good and very wide-ranging conversation” that covered United States-Saudi relations, common concerns about Iran and combating extremist groups, the Syrian civil war and the Saudi war in Yemen.The king “expressed the kingdom’s optimism that President Trump, with a new approach and determination, can bring a conclusion to this long conflict,” Jubeir said, referring to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. “He certainly has the vision and we believe the strength and the decisiveness,” Jubeir continued. “And the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia stands prepared to work with the United States in order to bring about peace between Israelis and Palestinians, and Israelis and Arabs.”Trump has yet to clarify his plan to oversee peace between Israel and the Palestinians who have been living under Israeli occupation since 1967. As a candidate, he vowed to repair ties with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who clashed bitterly with former President Barack Obama over West Bank settlements and the Iran nuclear deal. Trump even pledged to move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, a move that previous administrations had said they would make only when Jerusalem’s status is resolved in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.Trump has since effectively tabled that promise and hosted Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas at the White House earlier this month. Speaking about the possibility of an accord during the visit, Trump said, “We will get this done.” Trump is set to head to Israel after he leaves the Saudi capital of Riyadh early on Monday. He is scheduled to meet with Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Monday evening, and due to meet with Abbas on Tuesday.The visit follows an awkward moment in U.S.-Israeli relations. In a meeting with Russian officials last week, Trump reportedly revealed classified information provided by Israeli intelligence about an ISIS terror plot.Trump’s first trip abroad as president is providing the White House with an opportunity to draw attention from mounting scandals surrounding him at home. On Friday afternoon, The New York Times broke the latest in a string of revelations suggesting that Trump fired FBI Director James Comey to quash the agency’s investigation into Russian influence in the 2016 election. Trump reportedly told Russian officials that Comey was a “real nut job,” and that he had fired him to ease the “great pressure” the Russia probe had put on him.Saudi Arabia spared no pomp and circumstance in welcoming Trump, sending a formal royal delegation to greet him when he arrived on the tarmac and putting his face on billboards across the city. The Saudi government is eager to start fresh with the U.S. after several major disagreements marred its relationship with Obama. The Obama administration’s attempts at rapprochement with Iran, namely through the landmark agreement halting Iran’s nuclear program, and refusal to intervene against Syrian President Bashar Assad, rankled Riyadh. Unlike the reception given to Trump, the Saudi king notably refused to greet Obama at the tarmac during his last visit to the kingdom in April 2016. Still, the Obama administration provided crucial logistical support for Saudi Arabia’s controversial invasion of Yemen, which human rights groups say has resulted in a massive humanitarian crisis.The Obama administration had already committed to much of the $110 billion new weapons sales deal that Trump and Salman signed on Saturday. A new report commissioned by the human rights arm of the American Bar Association, and presented to the U.S. Senate, argues that the weapons sale is illegal under U.S. law in light of “recurring and highly questionable” Saudi airstrikes that resulted in civilian deaths."

He announced that he would use the trip to “begin to construct a new foundation... to combat extremism” and will be delivering a speech tomorrow on tolerance to leaders from roughly fifty Arab- or Muslim-majority countries.To succeed, sooner or later the president will have to address incitement in Riyadh’s government-published school textbooks, which have already been distributed to well over a dozen countries worldwide. Trump will never achieve his objective of defeating radical Islamic terrorism so long as every terrorist killed on the battlefield can be replaced by a new generation of radicalized recruits.Until 2015, the Saudi curriculum was so austere that the Islamic State was reportedly using the kingdom’s textbooks at schools in territory it had conquered. While some improvements have reportedly been made since then, a review of current textbooks (made available online by the kingdom’s government-owned corporation for curriculum modernization) reveals that egregious incitement remains.Morality CrimesSaudi textbooks for the current academic year call for the slaughter of people who engage in a range of non-violent acts considered immoral by Saudi religious authorities. This includes adultery, gay sex, disavowing or mocking Islam, and even “sorcery.”One high school textbook on introductory Islamic jurisprudence from 2016-2017 teaches that the agreed punishment for adultery is “stoning … until death.” The punishment for sodomy, it says, is “like the penalty for adultery,” namely to be killed. The lesson also teaches that adultery and sodomy bring shame to one’s entire family and tribe, a central tenet of the beliefs that lead to honor killings.Additionally, this textbook teaches that the punishment is death for anyone who refuses to recant from apostasy. The book describes examples of apostasy as “mocking” Allah, Islam, or the Prophet Muhammad or “moving toward [anything] other than Allah” in one’s acts of worship. The latter appears to be suggesting that explicit or implicit conversion from Islam to another religion warrants being killed.Another current textbook, this one an introductory text on monotheism, teaches that purported acts of sorcery carry penalties up to execution. It mandates the death penalty for what it labels the magic of “devils,” while it says sleight of hand requires anything from a firm rebuke to execution.Islamic SupremacismSaudi textbooks also still include passages that support Islamic supremacism, aggression, or intolerance toward people of other faiths.A 2016-2017 twelfth-grade textbook on monotheism forbids befriending “infidels” since it teaches that they are enemies of Muslims, citing a Quranic verse that says not to take Jews or Christians as allies. It adds that any infidels who have neither a non-aggression pact with Muslims nor diplomatic immunity must be treated as “combatants” or to submit as dhimmis, meaning non-Muslims who are forced to pay a special tax commonly associated with second-class status.A current high school textbook on the Hadith – the traditional corpus of actions attributed to the Prophet Muhammad – claims that the goal of Zionism is world domination, namely a “global Jewish government to control the entire world.” It singles out Zionism among all other self-determination movements as inherently racist and expansionist, somehow even blaming it for spreading drugs and sexually-transmitted diseases in the Islamic world.Likewise, a high school social studies textbook for 2016-2017 teaches that Zionism is an “octopus” that seeks to destroy the al-Aqsa Mosque and the entire “Islamic creed.”Just as this social studies book warns of a “Zionist danger” to Arabs and Muslims, the aforementioned Hadith textbook warns of a threat posed by “Christianization” in the Muslim world. It declares that “Christianity in its current state is an invalid, perverted religion” whose promoters seek to impose its dominion over Muslim nations through “intellectual invasion.” The book also slanders the American Universities in Cairo and Beirut, asserting that they are currently among “the institutions which are leading Christianization all over the world” today.The Saudi curriculum also displays continued hostility to Shi’ite Islam. An eighth-grade monotheism textbook from 2016-2017 teaches that praying while circumambulating graves, a practice commonly associated with Shi’ite or Sufi Muslims, is an act of polytheism and a potential departure from Islam. The photo next to this lesson appears to show an ornate mock tomb in front of a wall that displays the names of Shi’ite imams. Moving upwards to the high school level, another current textbook on monotheism calls for “fighting” any purported polytheist or infidel who refuses to submit to paying the tax for dhimmis, except under a handful of extenuating circumstances.A Moment of American LeverageTrump has significant leverage to encourage Saudi textbook reform if he chooses to use it.It is true that the royal family’s ruling bargain depends upon a measure of support from the hardline religious establishment – an unwritten rule says the Wahhabi religious scholars stay out of politics if the monarchy stays out of their affairs. But the House of Saud can also compel them toward moderation when it serves state interests. In the past, this has included the abolition of religiously-sanctioned slavery in 1962 to a new rule last year that curbed the religious police.Riyadh needs to remove such educational incitement to achieve its reform program’s stated objective – endorsed by the king and his cabinet – of being a “tolerant country with Islam as its constitution and moderation as its method.” Eliminating such incitement would also help the kingdom escape some of its punishing press coverage in the West and to forge closer alliances with America and in Europe. The alternative is more of what Saudi Arabia sees as its chronic foreign image problem, fueling anti-Saudi policies such as the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, which passed last year with virtually no opposition on Capitol Hill.Washington has leverage here, too. Saudi Arabia is so eager to patch up its frayed alliance with the U.S. that the king’s son recently went so far as to vouch for the president’s “deep respect” for Islam and endorse his immigration policies. Trump also arrived in the kingdom with new cachet, having authorized limited military action in Syria and approved a tougher tack on Tehran after Obama administration policies that eschewed such moves – to the consternation of the Saudi people.Trump should point out that in 2006 the kingdom assured the U.S. that it would remove all remaining passages from the books that promote hatred or disparage other religions by 2008. Saudi Arabia then pledged as part of the 2014 Jeddah Communiqué to do its part against the Islamic State by repudiating the hateful ideology espoused by IS and other violent extremists. That bill is long past due.It would also be fair to ask Riyadh to take other crucial steps against extremist indoctrination, such as to stop granting broadcast licenses to Salafist television channels that air hateful messages abroad, and to stop granting government privileges to preachers who propagate intolerance.Congress can help in this regard as well. It should direct the State Department to publish a comprehensive annual assessment of incitement in Saudi textbooks, to be conducted swiftly after the release of new editions each fall. Such transparent oversight could help ensure much-needed U.S. follow-through and create extra incentives for Saudi Arabia to tackle the issue in a timely manner.If the president wants to put “America first” in his bid to combat extremism, he should ditch the diplomatic niceties that gloss over such areas of concern. Instead, he should work with the Saudis to address state-backed incitement once and for all, especially in the kingdom’s official textbooks for children.Follow David Andrew Weinberg on Twitter: www.twitter.com/davidaweinberg"

He prevailed, of course, with the help of his colleagues who went to all ends of the earth to ensure that the “criminal” with the horrifyingly disqualifying emails would not step foot in the White House.Here we are, months later and the scandals under the Trump administration have only intensified, which until recently, with the appointment of special counsel, Robert Mueller have forced us to question whether or not anything Trump says or does is grounds for impartial investigation or impeachment. In the midst of firing FBI director, James Comey, one thing has become clearer: Trump’s agenda is based on annihilating all who dare to stand in the way of his quest for absolute power and obedience. And Republicans let it happen. All in the name of power and partisanship.They allowed Russia’s interference in the U.S. election to be treated as water under the bridge, they were deafly silent on the obvious suspicion involving the firing of James Comey and like clock work, they remain silent on the reports that revealed Donald Trump divulged highly classified information to Russian officials and even reports that Trump asked Comey to drop the investigation involving Flynn. While those dedicated to justice and preserving the integrity of the office have demanded an independent special prosecutor to review the evidence regarding Russia’s role in the election, most Republicans have either remained silent on the issue or expressed their disapproval of Trump’s actions while continuing to remain inactive. Let’s be clear, Republicans know Trump aides colluded with Russia to interfere with last year’s election, they know Trump fired Comey in an effort to cover it up and they know that Trump’s disclosure of highly classified information is a serious threat to American national security. But, to Republicans, the desire to consolidate power and the fear of losing it, takes precedence over the stability of our republic.Soon, a new scandal will emerge and again, Republicans will fall silent as the leader of our free world singlehandedly destroys what is left of this slowly crumpling democracy.It is fair to assume that if Obama or Clinton had committed such heinous acts, Republicans would be up in arms, demanding a special prosecutor and calling for the president’s impeachment while stopping at nothing to ensure the president paid for such reckless leadership and severe mismanagement of the highest office in the country.The Russian leak is a damning scandal. Damning enough to where it should mark the end of President Trump’s reign as president, our only hope is for a thorough investigation of Trump and Russia since we cannot depend on the leaders of the Republican party to have our backs.Ultimately, aside from this investigation that may take years, Trump’s fate in office depends not on the severity of his scandals, but rather how Republican leaders in Congress respond to the scandals. And because members in the party want to slash healthcare, minimize social programs and cut taxes, they will not denounce Trump or call for his removal unless the investigation reveals information that makes such reaction inevitable.Until then, Republicans will continue to make ritual statements about how worrisome Trump’s actions are without ever doing anything about it. They have abandoned any sort of integrity and have instead decided to accept the administration’s perpetual state of self-destruction in order to push forth their agenda."

Dr. Travis Bradberry breaks down the special habits that the best bosses share.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f7cb222600001800c46935.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"TalentSmart has conducted research with more than a million people, and we’ve found that the best bosses have a lot in common. In particular, 90% of them are skilled at managing their emotions in order to stay focused, calm, and productive.These folks have high emotional intelligence (EQ), a skill set that’s critical to achieving your dreams. It also happens to make them great to work for.It’s through a leader’s actions—what he or she does and says on a daily basis—that the essence of great leadership becomes apparent. Behavior can change, and leaders who work to improve themselves get results.While I’ve run across numerous effective strategies that great bosses employ, what follows are ten of the best. Some of these may seem obvious, but the real challenge lies in recognizing when you need to use them and having the wherewithal to actually do so.1. They’re ComposedGreat bosses are composed because they constantly monitor their emotions, they understand them, and they use this knowledge in the moment to react to challenging situations with self-control. When things go downhill, they are persistently calm and frustratingly content (frustrating to those who aren’t, at least). They know that no matter how good or bad things get, everything changes with time. All they can do is adapt and adjust to stay happy and in control.2. They’re GracefulGraceful people are the perfect combination of strong and gentle. They don’t resort to intimidation, anger, or manipulation to get a point across because their gentle, self-assured nature gets the job done. The word gentle often carries a negative connotation (especially in the workplace), but in reality, it’s the gentleness of being graceful that gives ultra successful leaders their power. They’re approachable, likeable, and easy to get along with—all qualities that make people highly amenable to their ideas.3. They’re KnowledgeableGreat bosses know more than others do because they’re constantly working to increase their self-awareness. They vow constant growth. Whenever they have a spare moment, they fill it with self-education. They don’t do this because it’s “the right thing to do”; they do it because it’s their passion. They’re always looking for opportunities to improve and new things to learn about themselves and the world around them. Instead of succumbing to their fear of looking stupid, truly exceptional people just ask the questions on their mind, because they would rather learn something new than appear smart.4. They’re HonestGreat bosses trust that honesty and integrity, though painful at times, always work out for the best in the long run. They know that honesty allows for genuine connections with people in a way that dishonesty can’t and that lying always comes back to bite you in the end. In fact, a Notre Dame study showed that people who often lied experienced more mental health problems than their more honest counterparts.5. They’re DeliberateGreat bosses reach decisions by thinking things out, seeking advice from others, and sleeping on it. They know that (as studies show) impulsively relying too much on gut-instinct is ineffective and misleading. Being able to slow down and logically think things through makes all the difference.6. They Speak with CertaintyIt’s rare to hear great bosses utter things like “Um,” “I’m not sure,” and “I think.” Successful leaders speak assertively because they know that it’s difficult to get people to listen to you if you can’t deliver your ideas with conviction.7. They Use Positive Body LanguageBecoming cognizant of your gestures, expressions, and tone of voice (and making certain they’re positive) draws people to you like ants to a picnic. Using an enthusiastic tone, uncrossing your arms, maintaining eye contact, and leaning towards the person who’s speaking are all forms of positive body language that super successful people use to draw others in. Positive body language makes all the difference in a conversation because how you say something can be more important than what you say.8. They're ConfidentSuccessful leaders like to challenge themselves and compete, even when their efforts yield only small victories. Small victories build new androgen receptors in the areas of the brain responsible for reward and motivation. The increase in androgen receptors increases the influence of testosterone, which further increases their confidence and eagerness to tackle future challenges. When you achieve a series of small victories, the boost in your confidence can last for months.9. They’re FearlessFear is nothing more than a lingering emotion that’s fueled by your imagination. Danger is real. It’s the uncomfortable rush of adrenaline you get when you almost step in front of a bus. Fear is a choice. Exceptional leaders know this better than anyone does, so they flip fear on its head. Instead of letting fear take over, they are addicted to the euphoric feeling they get from conquering their fears.10. They’re GratefulUltra successful leaders know that it took a lot of ambition, passion, and hard work to get where they are in life. They also know that their mentors, colleagues, families, and friends all played a huge role in their success. Instead of basking in the glory of achievement, these leaders recognize others for the wonderful things they’ve done for them.Bringing It All TogetherThese habits can make any of us more successful if we use them every day. Give them a try and see where they take you.Please share your thoughts in the comments section, as I learn just as much from you as you do from me.Want to learn more from me?

So I would like to thank all of the people of Saudi Arabia.”King Salman gave Trump a remarkably warm greeting, meeting him at the steps of Air Force One on arrival, shaking the hand of Trump’s wife, Melania, riding with Trump in his limousine and spending most of the day with him.But the political turmoil back in Washington consumed the headlines in the United States and cast a long shadow over the start of Trump’s trip, which will include stops in Israel, the Vatican, Italy and Belgium.His firing of Federal Bureau of Investigation head James Comey on May 9 and the appointment of a special counsel to investigate Trump’s 2016 presidential election campaign ties to Russia have raised the question of whether he tried to squelch a probe into allegations of a Russian connection.Fanning the flames was a New York Times report that Trump had called Comey a “nut job” in a private meeting last week in the Oval Office with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and ambassador Sergei Kislyak. The Times quoted briefing notes of the conversation.Amid a mood of frustration, officials on board Trump’s Riyadh-bound presidential plane scrambled to coordinate on responding to the story with staff in Washington and those who had just landed in the Saudi capital.Asked for a response, the White House said that for national security reasons, “we do not confirm or deny the authenticity of allegedly leaked classified documents.”Russia’s Interfax news agency on Saturday quoted Lavrov as saying he had not discussed Comey with Trump. “We did not touch this issue at all,” the minister said.In another development, the Washington Post said a White House official close to Trump was a significant “person of interest” in the investigation into possible ties with Russia.Tillerson, asked about the story, said he did not know who the “person of interest” was.Against that backdrop, Trump soldiered through a long day of diplomacy.Saudi foreign minister Adel al-Jubeir called the results of Trump’s meetings with Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz “the beginning of a turning point” between the United States, Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies.Both he and Tillerson made clear the arms deal was aimed at countering Iran on a day that Hassan Rouhani was re-elected as Iran’s president.Tillerson said Rouhani should use his second term to end Iran’s ballistic missile testing and stop promoting extremism in a volatile region.He said he had no plans to talk to his Iranian counterpart but that he in all likelihood he would do so “at the right time.”Al-Jubeir said Trump and King Salman agreed that action had to be taken to ensure Iran did not continue “aggressive policies in the region.”Trump’s trip has been billed by the White House as a chance to visit places sacred to three of the world’s major religions, while giving him time to meet with Arab, Israeli and European leaders.CONTRAST WITH OBAMA VISIT King Salman gave a more favorable welcome to Trump than he had granted last year to Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, who was seen in the Arab kingdom as soft on Iran and hesitant on Syria.Trump and King Salman seemed at ease with each other, chatting through an interpreter. At the royal al-Yamama palace, the king draped around Trump’s neck the King Abdulaziz medal, the country’s top civilian honor.At the end of the day, Tillerson and U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, holding swords, were seen participating in a ceremonial dance at Marraba Palace with a Saudi group.As Trump arrived for dinner with the king, a spectacle awaited him: Men dressed in long white turbans and carrying swords swayed and chanted in unison to beating drums in a courtyard. Trump, clearly enjoying himself, smiled and swayed, even seeming to dance a little at the center of the group.SYRIAN CIVIL WARDuring their conversation earlier in the day, the king was overheard lamenting the Syrian war. Trump ordered air strikes against a Syrian airfield in April in response to a chemical weapons attack by government forces against civilians.“Syria too used to be one of the most advanced countries. We used to get our professors from Syria. They served our kingdom. Unfortunately, they too brought destruction to their own country.

So I would like to thank all of the people of Saudi Arabia.”King Salman gave Trump a remarkably warm greeting, meeting him at the steps of Air Force One on arrival, shaking the hand of Trump’s wife, Melania, riding with Trump in his limousine and spending most of the day with him.But the political turmoil back in Washington consumed the headlines in the United States and cast a long shadow over the start of Trump’s trip, which will include stops in Israel, the Vatican, Italy and Belgium.His firing of Federal Bureau of Investigation head James Comey on May 9 and the appointment of a special counsel to investigate Trump’s 2016 presidential election campaign ties to Russia have raised the question of whether he tried to squelch a probe into allegations of a Russian connection.Fanning the flames was a New York Times report that Trump had called Comey a “nut job” in a private meeting last week in the Oval Office with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and ambassador Sergei Kislyak. The Times quoted briefing notes of the conversation.Amid a mood of frustration, officials on board Trump’s Riyadh-bound presidential plane scrambled to coordinate on responding to the story with staff in Washington and those who had just landed in the Saudi capital.Asked for a response, the White House said that for national security reasons, “we do not confirm or deny the authenticity of allegedly leaked classified documents.”Russia’s Interfax news agency on Saturday quoted Lavrov as saying he had not discussed Comey with Trump. “We did not touch this issue at all,” the minister said.In another development, the Washington Post said a White House official close to Trump was a significant “person of interest” in the investigation into possible ties with Russia.Tillerson, asked about the story, said he did not know who the “person of interest” was.Against that backdrop, Trump soldiered through a long day of diplomacy.Saudi foreign minister Adel al-Jubeir called the results of Trump’s meetings with Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz “the beginning of a turning point” between the United States, Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies.Both he and Tillerson made clear the arms deal was aimed at countering Iran on a day that Hassan Rouhani was re-elected as Iran’s president.Tillerson said Rouhani should use his second term to end Iran’s ballistic missile testing and stop promoting extremism in a volatile region.He said he had no plans to talk to his Iranian counterpart but that he in all likelihood he would do so “at the right time.”Al-Jubeir said Trump and King Salman agreed that action had to be taken to ensure Iran did not continue “aggressive policies in the region.”Trump’s trip has been billed by the White House as a chance to visit places sacred to three of the world’s major religions, while giving him time to meet with Arab, Israeli and European leaders.CONTRAST WITH OBAMA VISIT King Salman gave a more favorable welcome to Trump than he had granted last year to Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, who was seen in the Arab kingdom as soft on Iran and hesitant on Syria.Trump and King Salman seemed at ease with each other, chatting through an interpreter. At the royal al-Yamama palace, the king draped around Trump’s neck the King Abdulaziz medal, the country’s top civilian honor.At the end of the day, Tillerson and U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, holding swords, were seen participating in a ceremonial dance at Marraba Palace with a Saudi group.As Trump arrived for dinner with the king, a spectacle awaited him: Men dressed in long white turbans and carrying swords swayed and chanted in unison to beating drums in a courtyard. Trump, clearly enjoying himself, smiled and swayed, even seeming to dance a little at the center of the group.SYRIAN CIVIL WARDuring their conversation earlier in the day, the king was overheard lamenting the Syrian war. Trump ordered air strikes against a Syrian airfield in April in response to a chemical weapons attack by government forces against civilians.“Syria too used to be one of the most advanced countries. We used to get our professors from Syria. They served our kingdom. Unfortunately, they too brought destruction to their own country. You can destroy a country in mere seconds, but it takes a lot of effort,” he said.Trump’s response could not be heard.The arms package includes a pledge by the kingdom to assemble 150 Lockheed Martin Blackhawk helicopters in Saudi Arabia, in a $6 billion deal expected to result in about 450 jobs in the kingdom.National oil giant Saudi Aramco was also expected to sign $50 billion of deals with U.S. companies on Saturday, part of a drive to diversify the kingdom’s economy beyond oil exports, Aramco’s chief executive Amin Nasser said.U.S. technology and engineering conglomerate GE said it had signed $15 billion of agreements with Saudi organizations.Trump is to deliver a speech in Riyadh on Sunday aimed at rallying Muslims in the fight against Islamist militants.

But there’s another earthling-influenced phenomenon we don’t hear too much about: how we affect what happens in space.According to NASA:Space weather ― which can include changes in Earth’s magnetic environment ― are usually triggered by the sun’s activity, but recently declassified data on high-altitude nuclear explosion tests have provided a new look at the mechanisms that set off perturbations in that magnetic system.Earth is surrounded by layers of radiation belts, and as the space agency says in the following video, the Cold War-era experiments of the 1950s and ‘60s produced extra radiation close to Earth.While those military tests concluded long ago, the after-effects of such actions, now called human-induced space weather, are the focus of a new study published in Space Science Reviews, which offers research access to millions of scientific documents.As reported in The Scientific Foundation of Space Weather:These explosions created artificial radiation belts near Earth that resulted in major damages to several satellites. Another unexpected impact of the high-altitude nuclear tests was the electromagnetic pulse that can have devastating effects over a large geographic area (such as the continental United States).Certain types of communications ― very low frequency, or VLF, radio communications ― have been found to interact with particles in space, affecting how and where they move. At times, these interactions can create a barrier around Earth against natural high-energy particle radiation in space.The following video depicts this barrier or bubble around our planet, which, according to NASA, was created by those VLF waves. “A number of experiments and observations have figured out that, under the right conditions, radio communications signals in the VLF frequency range can, in fact, affect the properties of the high-energy radiation environment around the Earth,” Phil Ericson, assistant director at the MIT Haystack Observatory in Massachusetts, said in a NASA statement.The space agency added that while these VLF signals are used to communicate with submarines, “they also extend out beyond our atmosphere, shrouding Earth in a VLF bubble” that even “spacecraft high above Earth’s surface” can see."

A spokesperson for the airline confirmed to HuffPost that crew members on American Airlines Flight 31, which departed from Los Angeles, requested law enforcement to meet the aircraft at the Daniel K. Inouye International Airport “due to a disturbance.”Los Angeles airport police identified the man as 25-year-old Anil Uskanil, according to Hawaii news station KHON2. Before the flight to Hawaii, Uskanil was arrested about 2:45 a.m. Pacific time for misdemeanor trespassing at the Los Angeles International Airport for going through a restricted door that led to the airfield ramp, the Los Angeles Airport Police Division said in a statement. Police said he had been drinking but did not meet the criteria for a drunk-in-public violation.In response to the crew members’ disturbance report, U.S. Pacific Command deployed two F-22 Raptors from the Hawaii Air National Guard to escort flight AA31 into the Honolulu airport, Cmdr. Dave Benham, a spokesman for Pacific Command, told HuffPost.Local law enforcement apprehended Uskanil once the flight landed in Hawaii at 11:35 a.m. local time. The FBI is investigating the incident, according to the Honolulu Police Department. The FBI did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.A passenger on the flight posted an Instagram video of the arrest.“Crazy! Someone tried to break into the cockpit on my flight from LA to Honolulu,” Instagram user bplus.noisefloor.dnb wrote.“We were greeted by the FBI,” the passenger added. “They are now taking us off the plane a few rows at a time for dog sniffing and interviews. I’ve never seen anything like this.”FBI officials escorted Uskanil from the plane in handcuffs.He had been drinking and moved toward the cockpit during the flight, a law enforcement source told the Los Angeles Times, adding that they believe it is the case of an unruly passenger.A source with the Transportation Security Administration told ABC News that Uskanil had a laptop and appeared to be waiting for the bathroom. A flight attendant told him to sit down, and he was reportedly subdued when he attempted to open the cockpit door, according to ABC News’ TSA source. The Department of Homeland Security released a statement saying there were no other reports of flight disruptions but they would “continue to monitor all flights out of an abundance of caution and will provide updates as necessary.” Officials cleared the passengers and checked the aircraft for explosives.All ground movement at the airport was halted as American Airlines Flight 31 reached Honolulu, according to local news station KHON2.The incident caused a 30-minute backlog, the Hawaii Department of Transportation told KHON2."

The Kim family fears that its country will be overrun, and it fears that its members will be tried for an array of offenses, including war crimes. Their principal interest is their personal survival. To ensure their survival the Kim family has engaged in a range of activities that paradoxically are combining to ensure its destruction if it remains on its current course. In particular, it seeks to develop a nuclear strike force and the mechanisms to deliver nuclear warheads to targets including US allies, US bases in the Far East, and the Western portions of the US Mainland. Additionally, it seeks to portray itself as willing, even eager, to use those weapons.The US faces a complex problem in international diplomacy, but one that can be set up as a simple 2x2 non-zero sum matrix game. If the North strikes while the West waits, this is the worst outcome for the US and its interests in the region. If the US strikes before North Korea, there will still be enormous damage to US interests, but less than if the West waits, that would suggest that the US should attack first. Of course, if the North believes that, the North should also try to strike first, leading damage to US interests somewhere between the two extremes. Why should the US wait. Non-zero sum games require that both sides understand the incentives, or “payoffs” available to the other side. Any action that results in a strike by the US against North Korea will result in the death of the Kim family and the end of its regime. This is the one thing that the Kim family has been seeking to avoid. It is the one thing that has restrained their actions internationally. They may be morally bankrupt. But they are not insane. So they wait. And we wait.However, the current situation is not stable. The more the North invests in its offensive capability, and the more the North engages in rhetorical excesses about reducing the US to flaming ruins, the more likely the US is to view a preemptive strike as the least bad of its options. The most likely outcome appears to be the destruction of North Korea, with massive loss of life in both North and South Korea, and, perhaps in Japan and other sites viewed as allied with US interests.One of the first things one learns when trying to apply game theory is that we usually formulate the game incorrectly when we do not fully understand the incentives driving the behavior of each participant. Let’s extend the game by adding an alternative solution. Let’s try to create the full array of scenarios for analyzing the problem.We start with the two obvious questions: Does the US attack first or wait? Does North Korea attack first or wait? And we provide a single additional uncertainty: Can the Kim family be persuaded to leave North Korea as part of a negotiated solution?This negotiated solution would indeed be preferable for all parties affected by the current disputes between the US and North Korea.· The solution allows the US to avoid war with North Korea, and the massive loss of life and massive collateral damage that would result.· It solution allows the Kim family to achieve its principal objectives, including the fact that it is not obliterated by military action, it does not face trial for war crimes, and it retains enormous wealth.· China retains a buffer state between itself and South Korea.· Japan and other countries in the region escape the threat of war, including both direct attack and potential radioactive fallout from that war.Can this solution be achieved? In game theory, we note that sometimes there is an outcome in a game that makes almost everyone much better off, but makes one party worse off. This would create enormous surplus for the collection of all players, but the surplus is not divided evenly. The party that would be harmed usually refuses to make the move that is necessary to create the surplus; this is not spite, but a rational attempt to avoid being harmed. The best way forward is to create a side-payment, where the parties that are better off share the surplus with the party that would otherwise be harmed.So, the question now becomes, “Can the Kim family be ‘bought off’?” Diplomacy would place a gentler label on this, but the basic idea is can the Kim family be given enough to persuade them to leave North Korea? What would that require? Sanctuary, of course. Enormous personal wealth, of course. They might still not be welcome at the Cannes Film Festival or at the Kennedy Center in Washington, and their kids might not be welcome at Oxford or the Harvard Business School, but at least they would live long enough to have grandchildren who would be welcome. Moreover, a look at the grid below suggests that the status quo, in amber, is unstable. A negotiated exit preserves the wealth of the Kim family. It preserves their lives. None of the remaining scenarios is certain to offer either.Let’s examine each of the five scenarios in more detail.· More of the Same (Amber) — This represents a continuation of the status quo. It is acceptable to the US and the preferred scenario of the Kim region. But it is inherently unstable, in large measure due to the actions of the Kim regime, its development of offensive weapons of mass destruction, and its continued proclaimed eagerness to use them. It is likely that the optimal time for the Kim regime to negotiate is approaching. This may be a perfect time for a move to the Green scenario. If the opportunity is lost, the Kim regime may lose the only opportunity to preserve the lives of the family and the family’s wealth.· Hey! Against All Odds (Green) — Kim family leaves North Korea. The family members and the senior members of the regime are given sanctuary in a location in China, and brings a vast sum with them, perhaps US$ 5 billion. North Korea is placed under some form of international supervision and the population is provided emergency food, medical, and educational relief to aid their transition as members of the modern world. China retains a neutral power as a buffer between themselves and South Korea. This is the best outcome for China, since they are free of the possibility of nuclear war on their borders. This is the best for the West, since the greatest current flashpoint is defused. This is best for North Korea, since instead of their current starvation and isolation at best, and the threat of nuclear war at worst, they face return to a normal existence that most of their population has never experienced. This is best for the entire world. Significantly, this is the best outcome for Kim. Indeed, it is unlikely that there is any scenario in which he survives.· Kim Goes Out with a Bang! (Dark Red) — This is worst for the US. It is the end of the Kim regime and a disaster for the people of North Korea.· Everyone Hits the Button (Medium Red) — This is bad for the US. It is the end of the Kim regime and a disaster for the people of North Korea.· Preemptive American Strike (Light Red) — This is least bad for the US. It is the end of the Kim regime and a disaster for the people of North Korea.Strategic AnalysisThe two scenarios in the upper right are best for Kim. Unfortunately for Kim, the combination of his actions, his nuclear ambitions, and his rhetoric are sufficient to render the continuation of the status quo impossible. His best remaining alternative is a negotiated retreat, including sanctuary, immunity from prosecution, and the retention of significant family wealth. Failing that, the only remaining scenarios involve total destruction of Kim and his regime, with massive collateral damage to the North and to US regional interests.A negotiated exit represents the best hope for everyone from Kim and the helpless North Korean people to China, America, and its allies, and to citizens throughout Eastern Asia. It doesn’t matter whether or not the Western world believes that Kim is truly evil. We need to hope that he is not truly insane, and that he can be persuaded to accept a large enough side payment. Dropping the language of game theory, we need to hope that he can be bought off."

Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) introduced the Stop Waste and Misuse by the President ― or SWAMP ― Act to the House this month. If passed, taxpayers would be reimbursed for the millions of dollars they spend on Trump’s trips to his own properties, including Mar-a-Lago ― where he bragged about enjoying “beautiful” chocolate cake as he told Chinese President Xi Jinping about his decision to launch 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles against Syria in April.“President Trump is on track to spend more during his first year of office than all eight years of the Obama administration combined,” by taking his weekend trips, Lieu’s bill says.Each trip to Mar-a-Lago costs around $3.7 million in security costs alone. And that’s not including the more than $34,000 spent on golf cart rentals the Secret Service orders. In New York City, meanwhile, trips to Trump Tower have already racked up more than $20 million in taxpayer dollars. If that wasn’t troubling enough, the federal government officially promoted Mar-a-Lago when the State Department posted an article crooning over the mansion.“It is unacceptable for the President to maintain an interest in traveling to properties in which he has a direct financial interest, as the U.S. Government is responsible for renting space for personnel in said private commercial entities,” the bill argues.The website IsTrumpAtMarALago.com tracks how often Trump travels to his Florida mansion to play golf. In the 18 weeks of his presidency, Trump has gone on vacation eight of those weeks, according to the website created by the Center for American Progress Action Fund. “It’s supremely hypocritical of Donald Trump to spend millions of government dollars at Mar-a-Lago while crusading to cut vital programs such as Meals on Wheels,” CAP Action spokeswoman Morgan Finkelstein said in a press release. “Our tracker will provide context and keep Trump accountable for his out-of-control spending at taxpayers’ expense.” Trump has not commented on the proposed legislation, but former Republican Party Chairman Frank Visco told CBS Los Angeles that the bill likely won’t pass."

But local news outlets have delivered.For an in-depth reported column published Friday in The Record, a newspaper in northern New Jersey, Mike Kelly traveled to Comey’s hometown of Allendale to speak with the former FBI director’s father and childhood friends.The people he interviewed, many of whom remain in touch with Comey, describe a man of impeccable integrity who has become a hero of sorts in the affluent New York City suburb where he was raised.“Anyone from Allendale that knows the family and grew up around him knows that he is a good person and has an honest character and has the utmost integrity,” Patty Corn, a classmate of Comey’s at Northern Highlands Regional High School, told the publication. “That doesn’t leave you.”They rejected President Donald Trump’s claims that Comey was a “showboat” motivated by his desire for self-aggrandizement.“There’s nobody in Washington that I respect more for his integrity,” said former Republican Mayor Vincent Barra. “I think it’s unfortunate that he got caught in this whirlwind of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.”James Brien Comey Sr., the father of the former FBI director, is a retired vice president of the aerospace manufacturer Curtiss-Wright. He once served as a councilman for the borough of Allendale, where he still lives.The elder Comey is a lifelong Republican, but said he left the top of the ballot blank in 2016 because he couldn’t bring himself to vote for Trump. He blamed the current scandal on the president, slamming him by using terms similar to those Trump reportedly used when describing his son to Russian officials visiting the White House.“I never was crazy about Trump,” Comey Sr. said. “I’m convinced that he’s nuts. I thought he belonged in an institution. He was crazy before he became president. Now he’s really crazy.”Chris Kunisch, whose family has owned and operated the Allendale Bar and Grill for three generations, said he would like to see Comey run for office.“We haven’t seen the last of Jim Comey,” Kunisch said. “Who’s not to say he could be president someday? I think he’s going to emerge out of this and be whatever he wants to be.”Even acquaintances of Comey have fond memories of him. Comey was a regular at Village Bagels in Westport, Connecticut, according to Westport News. Comey moved to the area in 2010 to serve as general counsel for the investment firm Bridgewater Associates.Abdul Khedira, the bagel shop’s manager, remembered Comey as a “super nice” guy who may have been pushed out of his job because of his integrity.“I think [Comey] is very independent. Quite independent. Nobody will blackmail him,” Khedira told the Westport News.Democrats and some Republicans have suspected the president of trying to silence the investigation into his campaign’s connections to Russia, considering that Trump fired Comey just days after the then-FBI director testified to Congress about the investigation and that the White House has been inconsistent in its justifications for the ouster.A series of leaks about Trump’s conversations with Comey and private comments about the firing have only heightened suspicion about the president’s conduct. In the same conversation with Russian officials in which Trump reportedly called Comey a “real nut job,” he claimed that the firing had relieved “great pressure” that he had been under over the Russia investigation.In a bid to shore up confidence in the investigation into Russian influence in the U.S. election, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein on Wednesday appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as a special counsel to oversee the probe.Comey has also now agreed to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee in a public hearing, the committee announced on Friday."

Choi shot to internet fame last week after photos of him protecting the president went viral. His good looks apparently stole the show.Now, people are giddy again after one person found photos of a shirtless model resembling Choi.As if Choi’s smoldering stare wasn’t swoon-worthy enough, the man in the new photos (if it is indeed Choi) looks even more charming with a smile and a six pack.Choi hasn’t confirmed the authenticity of the modeling pictures, but the internet is convinced it’s him.AllKpop, a South Korean culture blog, dug up more information and published more pictures of Choi in other career roles ― and, yes, they include the photos of him as a shirtless and chiseled model. BuzzFeed also launched an investigation into Choi’s alleged abs.Choi, a happily married father of two, revealed in an interview with The Korea Times that he was protecting the president as a volunteer when the photos showing him next to the president were taken.Choi told the The Korea Times he had been an officer in the South Korean military for 10 years, serving in the Special Warfare Command, and was a counter-terror attacks instructor. He said he has an honorary 11th-degree black belt in martial arts.Choi, a fervent supporter of the new president, was apprehensive about his newfound fame.“I feel good. But also I’m concerned about the spotlight and the attention focused on me,” he told The Korea Times. “Attention should be paid to the president, not me. I don’t want to steal the limelight.”Choi might not like all the new press, but the internet, with its thirst for handsome Asian men, wants to keep his fame alive."
