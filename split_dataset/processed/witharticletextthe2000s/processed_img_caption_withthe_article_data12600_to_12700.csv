It is not even expensive to practice,” he added.The Modi’s official Twitter handle, which has more than 30 million followers, has posted pictures of mass yoga sessions in China, Colombia, the United States, Paraguay, Mexico, Italy, Singapore and atop Machu Picchu, a 15th century Inca citadel in Peru.Social media was flooded with pictures of yoga, the country’s signature cultural export, being performed in various places including an Indian Navy submarine and the landing deck of an aircraft carrier.“It is not only the world’s longest serving aircraft carrier but also the world’s longest-serving warship. I think the ship must have done lots of pranayaams to be sustaining for so long,” top naval officer Puneet Chadha told a TV channel, referring to a yogic breathing technique.Indian President Pranab Mukherjee held a yoga session at the presidential palace and several members of Modi’s cabinet joined similar events across the country.Modi pushed for the annual event to be celebrated worldwide after winning power in 2014, promoting a lifestyle industry that has grown up around the ancient physical and spiritual discipline and is estimated to be worth around $80 billion."

5,POLITICS,Republicans Hold On To Mick Mulvaney's Old House Seat In South Carolina,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/south-carolina-special-ralph-norman-wins_us_59498830e4b0db570d37599c,The special election was overshadowed by a similar race in Georgia.,2017-06-21,"Republican Ralph Norman, right, campaigns in South Carolina's 5th District.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59498ac81500001f008ff567.jpeg?cache=MaYAOfQggU&ops=crop_0_392_1512_1446%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Republican Ralph Norman won Tuesday’s special election in South Carolina for a U.S. House seat, defeating Democrat Archie Parnell in the solidly GOP 5th Congressional District, according to The Associated Press.Norman, a 63-year-old real estate developer and former state lawmaker, replaces fellow Republican Mick Mulvaney, who left Congress to become President Donald Trump’s budget director.Parnell, a 66-year-old tax attorney, mounted an unusually ambitious challenge in the district where the conservative Mulvaney cruised to re-election in 2016. His scrappy campaign, and the support it received from the national Democratic Party, excited local activists accustomed to being written off by party leaders.Michele Horne, 42, a Rock Hill-based supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) who volunteered for Parnell, blamed the outcome on her fellow constituents’ strong identification with the Republican Party.“South Carolinians still have not gotten to the point where they can look at issues versus keeping it strictly partisan politics,” said Horne, a co-founder of the progressive #DemEnter group. “On the issues, Archie is clearly a better choice for anybody who lives in the state other than very wealthy people.”Norman is likely to add to the strength of the House’s contingent of fiscal hard-liners. He has said he would consider joining the House Freedom Caucus, a group Mulvaney helped found and which is comprised of the chamber’s most conservative Republicans.Norman campaigned heavily on his commitment to helping Trump enact his agenda, including the repeal of Obamacare. He has also embraced raising the Social Security retirement age and, following last week’s shooting of House Majority Whip Steve Scalise and others at a baseball field, said he believes more members of Congress should carry guns.In addition, Norman touted the endorsements of high-profile national conservatives, including Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Fox News host Sean Hannity.Trump recorded a robocall for Norman over the weekend and tweeted his support for the GOP candidate on Monday:The district, a largely rural swath of the state that stretches from Sumter in the south to the suburbs of Charlotte, North Carolina, was always going to be difficult territory for a Democrat. Mulvaney was reelected there in 2016 by 20 percentage points, and Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton among the district’s voters by 18.5 points.But in a year when Democrats have been champing at the bit to humble Trump with upset victories in special election races, including Georgia’s 6th Congressional District, which they also lost late Tuesday, Parnell ran his party’s most formidable campaign in the district since 2010. That was when Mulvaney unseated veteran Rep. John Spratt, ending the Democrats’ more-than-century-long hold on the seat.Parnell raised $763,000 for his bid, including $305,000 that he either lent or donated to the campaign. Norman raised $1.3 million, much of which also came from his own pocket.The national attention and resources showered on what polls showed to be a neck-and-neck special election Tuesday in Georgia’s 6th congressional district overshadowed the race in South Carolina.But Democrats in Washington did not ignore Parnell entirely.Shortly after Parnell released an internal poll at the end of May showing that he had narrowed Norman’s lead to 10 percentage points, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee contributed $275,000 to his bid.Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez, DNC Associate Chairman Jaime Harrison and American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten canvassed for Parnell as part of the kickoff of the DNC’s “Resistance Summer.” Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley and Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan also campaigned for Parnell in person, while former Vice President Joe Biden taped a robocall for him. Parnell was previously a tax adviser for Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs. Before entering the private sector, he served as a tax attorney for the Department of Justice and staff director of the House Ways and Means Committee.Rather than shy away from his lucrative Hong Kong-based stint at Goldman Sachs, Parnell claimed that experience gave him the expertise needed to cut middle-class families’ taxes and close corporate tax loopholes. He even laughed about it on more than one occasion. “I know enough about our crazy tax code to absolutely bore you to tears,” Parnell said in “Know-How,” one of two ads he aired on television.“You have no idea,” Parnell’s wife Sara deadpanned. Seeking the support of Republicans and independents, Parnell emphasized his commitment to compromising with lawmakers on the other side of the aisle and rejected a push for single-payer health insurance in favor of fixing Obamacare. At the same time, he didn’t back away from more progressive Democratic positions, such as calling for importation of safe prescription drugs and opposing all cuts to Social Security benefits. He also went on record supporting the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law, abortion rights and closing the “default to proceed” loophole that allows guns sales without background checks if the FBI fails to complete the screening within three days.With positions like those, Parnell managed to attract the enthusiastic backing of the local Sanders supporters.“I like the idea that he understands how business works,” said Susan Maxson, a 54-year-old Sanders enthusiast and campaign volunteer. “I’m not gonna hold his previous employer against him by any means.”"

CREDO Action’s billboards take aim at Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) for their involvement in Republican health care discussions. The group is placing the billboards where the lawmakers and their constituents can easily see them, near airports in their home states that the senators use to fly to Washington, D.C.All three Democrats represent states that voted for President Donald Trump in November. They are up for re-election in 2018 and have drawn CREDO’s ire for engaging in preliminary discussions on health care with Republicans in May.Many Democrats have expressed outrage that GOP senators are drafting a health care bill they hope to bring directly to the floor for a vote before the July 4 recess without public hearings or deliberations. Without the votes to stop the bill outright, Democrats say they’re determined to slow the legislation’s progress in the Senate.“The Republicans are writing their health care bill under the cover of darkness because they’re ashamed of it, plain and simple,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) on the Senate floor on Monday.But Manchin said Schumer was aware of the talks and defended them as an attempt to find common ground. “I said, ‘I don’t think there’s a Democrat that would vote for any type of a repeal. But I think there would be 48 Democrats who are willing to work on some repairing or fixing,’” he told Politico last month.In addition to billboards, CREDO has expanded its strategy to Snapchat geofilters and tweets. In a statement, the group said it was “blanketing” the senators’ D.C. and state offices with geofilters and tweets from constituents, calling on the senators “to block and resist Trumpcare.”CREDO members have also taken the more traditional route of dialing in, racking up a total of 2,900 phone calls to the three senators in recent weeks. In total, the group has accumulated 650,000 petition signatures and made 30,000 calls to Congress, including over 25,000 calls to Republican offices to block the bill.“No Democrat should be complicit in the Republicans’ heartless maneuvering to take away health care from millions of Americans,” CREDO Political Director Murshed Zaheed said in a statement. “Instead of collaborating with the Republicans, Senators Heitkamp, Donnelly and Manchin must do everything they can to block and resist Trumpcare.”"

8,POLITICS,Georgia Democrat Jon Ossoff Falls Short In Bid For U.S. House Seat,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jon-ossoff-loss-georgia-special-election_us_5949ad73e4b0177d0b8a4c46,A tough loss for Democrats.,2017-06-21,Democrat Jon Ossoff lost to Republican Karen Handel on Tuesday in a closely watched special election for Georgia's 6th Congressional District.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5949ae0a1500001f008ff5f0.jpeg?cache=mbKHNsPqwU&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Republican Karen Handel was the projected winner of Tuesday’s special election for Georgia’s 6th Congressional District, according to CNN, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and NBC. Handel defeated Democrat Jon Ossoff in a traditional GOP stronghold that polling suggested could be in play this time around.The outcome is especially painful for Democrats who viewed Ossoff’s candidacy as a prime opportunity to land a blow against President Donald Trump.Handel, a 55-year-old former Georgia secretary of state, replaces Republican Tom Price, who left Congress to become Trump’s secretary of health and human services.Ossoff, a 30-year-old documentary filmmaker and former congressional aide, was ultimately unable to peel away enough anti-Trump Republicans or mobilize enough new Democratic-leaning voters to overcome the district’s deep-seated Republican leanings.“It was really all about the Republican candidate Karen Handel getting her Republican base to show up in force,” said Kerwin Swint, chair of the political science department at Kennesaw State University, just outside Atlanta. “That’s what made the difference. Jon Ossoff was successful in eating into that base but obviously not quite enough to put him over the top.”Until November, it would have been unheard of for Democrats to make a serious run at Georgia’s 6th District. Price won reelection in the largely suburban and affluent stretch of metropolitan Atlanta by 23 percentage points in 2016.Price’s predecessor in the seat was Sen. Johnny Isakson. Before Isakson, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich held the 6th District seat.But Trump turned off the district’s fiscally conservative, so-called country club Republicans, who chose him over Democratic presidential rival Hillary Clinton by just 1.5 percentage points.And the district includes a growing population of Latino, Asian and young voters, all of whom are more likely to vote Democratic.In short, it presented the opportunity to deliver on Clinton’s campaign strategy of picking off just enough educated Republicans fed up with Trump while mobilizing President Barack Obama’s coalition of young voters, liberals and communities of color.Virtually from the moment Ossoff announced his campaign in January, donations poured in nationally from Democrats livid about Trump and eager to find an outlet for their anger. Republicans quickly realized they had a fight on their hands and responded in turn.The result is the most expensive House race in U.S. history, with $51.9 million spent on Ossoff’s and Handel’s bids. The previous record was $29.5 million on a Florida race in 2012.Georgia uses a nonpartisan primary system in which candidates can avoid a runoff by getting more than 50 percent of the primary vote. Ossoff tried mightily to win outright in the first round of voting on April 18, reasoning that the district’s Republicans were more likely to turn out in a head-to-head matchup. In the end he came up just short, winning 48.1 percent of the vote. The money, volunteers, celebrity endorsements and attention from top party chieftains kept arriving, though, buoying him to lead Handel by a thin margin in many polls ahead of Tuesday’s race.In the runup to the first round of voting, Ossoff, a gifted public speaker, took a more partisan approach. His campaign said a vote for Ossoff would “make Donald Trump furious.”Since then, Ossoff has taken a more moderate route, emphasizing his commitment to bipartisanship, reducing federal spending and investing in high-tech jobs. He has hardly mentioned Trump.Ossoff even went out of his way to disavow single-payer health insurance coverage and rule out increasing taxes for the rich.When Handel slipped up, stating during a debate that she did not support increasing the minimum wage to a “livable wage,” Ossoff drew a clear contrast, insisting on his support for a higher minimum wage. But he has declined to say how high he would raise it or to use the issue in any of his ads.In his campaign’s final ad, the two-minute “Momentum” commercial, Ossoff used Obama-like rhetoric to appeal to the multicultural, global sensibilities of many socially liberal voters.“Instead of being divided among ourselves, and scapegoating our neighbors and our friends, and being afraid of one another and afraid of the world, we love each other instead, and make things happen together,” Ossoff can be heard saying as images of his campaign flash on the screen.Many progressive health care advocates viewed a victory for Ossoff as the last line of defense against a Senate bill that is expected to resemble the Obamacare repeal bill passed by the House. The thinking goes that the Georgia election was a referendum on the American Health Care Act, as the House bill is known, and a win for Ossoff would scare enough Senate Republicans into abandoning the effort.Ossoff condemned the AHCA, which he said “puts Georgians’ lives at risk.” He favored fixing Obamacare through largely unspecified bipartisan solutions.At the same time, he never quite made Handel’s support for the bill a key focus of his campaign.One area where Ossoff did not hold back is on Handel’s tenure as a vice president for public policy at Susan G. Komen for the Cure, the country’s largest breast cancer charity. In 2012, Handel caused a national scandal when it emerged that she was responsible for pulling Komen’s funding for Planned Parenthood’s breast and cervical cancer screenings due to her personal opposition to abortion, which Planned Parenthood also provides for women. (Handel resigned in response to the uproar over the decision.)In more than one of his ads, Ossoff featured breast cancer survivors denouncing Handel’s role at Komen.Handel, who raised far less than Ossoff individually, depended heavily on cavalry from Republican political action committees. These outside groups did their best to paint Ossoff as essentially a San Francisco liberal in the mold of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), playing up just how much money Ossoff received from out-of-state donors.They also attacked Ossoff at every opportunity for living outside of the district.Even Trump tried it in a series of tweets encouraging voters to turn out for Handel:Ossoff has always responded that he lives two miles south so his fiancée can be within walking distance of Emory University’s medical school, where she is a student.Finally, just days before the first ballots were cast, a top Republican in Georgia said he believed the recent shooting that injured Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) in Virginia would help boost Handel to Congress.“I’ll tell you what: I think the shooting is going to win this election for us,” Brad Carver, the party chairman in Georgia’s 11th congressional district, said.A right-leaning political action committee also ran an attack ad against Ossoff last weekend that cited the shooting and claimed “the unhinged left is endorsing and applauding shooting Republicans.” The ad continued: “When will it stop? It won’t if Jon Ossoff wins on Tuesday.”Handel, the Republican candidate, condemned the ad, but never insisted that it be yanked from the airwaves.It is doubtful that one line of criticism, or even the accumulation of them, did Ossoff in. The fundamentally Republican leaning of the district always meant that Ossoff would have to both win over Republicans and turn out new voters.But the reasons for the outcome do little to make the results in Georgia any less devastating for Democrats and the so-called resistance movement to Trump, which spared no expense in the race.Liberal critics are liable to fault Ossoff for campaigning as a centrist rather than emphasizing health care or other progressive economic stances.They are also likely to question why the party bothered expending so much energy on Georgia’s 6th District rather than a host of other special elections, including Tuesday’s race for South Carolina’s 5th Congressional District, which proved surprisingly close, with Republican Ralph Norman defeating Democrat Archie Parnell.Others still may wonder if Pelosi should remain the party’s leader if Republicans can so easily turn her into a political weapon against Democratic candidates with completely different policy positions.“Part of it is the Nancy Pelosi thing. Enough Republicans in the district are wary enough of Jon Ossoff and not buying into what he is trying to say: ‘I’m independent, fresh-faced and will fight overspending in Washington, D.C.,’” Swint of Kennesaw State said.Nick Visser contributed reporting."

You probably never heard of it but around 68,000 cases are reported annually with some 13,600 to 20,400 deaths. More than 3 billion people live in 24 countries that have JE virus transmission risk areas. In 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) received reports of 4,087 JE cases from 20 (83%) of 24 countries; 3,549 (87%) of these cases were reported from four countries: China, India, Nepal, and Vietnam. The first case of Japanese encephalitis was documented in 1871 in Japan, hence the name, Japanese Encephalitis. While the name is Japanese encephalitis, it is not only limited to Japan. The virus has since spread through the regions of South East Asia and a massive outbreak had occurred in Thailand, Vietnam, India, Myanmar and Sri Lanka.Disease Outbreaks & TransmissionThis mosquito-borne virus, transmitted mainly by the vector Culex (mainly Culex tritaeniorhynchus), belongs to the same family as dengue, yellow fever and West Nile viruses. The virus exists in a transmission cycle between mosquitoes, pigs and /or water birds (enzootic cycle). The disease is predominantly found in rural and peri-urban settings, where humans live in closer proximity to the viral hosts. More recently, researchers have found for the first time that JE virus can be transmitted directly between pigs - without a mosquito go-between.Major outbreaks of JE occur every 2-15 years. In most temperate areas of Asia, JE virus is transmitted mainly during the warm season, when large epidemics can occur. In the tropics and subtropics, transmission can occur year-round, but often intensifies during the rainy season (during which mosquito population increases) and pre-harvest period in rice-cultivating regions, where rice paddies filled with standing water are found in close proximity to pig farms.Signs & SymptomsJE symptoms usually take 5-15 days to develop and include fever, headache, confusion, vomiting and difficulty moving. More serious presentation of JE includes symptoms such as disorientation, coma, seizures, spastic paralysis and ultimately, death. The case-fatality rate (proportion of people who die among all individuals diagnosed) can be as high as 30% among those with symptoms and among those who survive, 30 – 50% suffer permanent intellectual, behavioral or neurological problems such as paralysis, recurrent seizures or the inability to speak. Individuals who live in or have traveled to a JE-endemic area and experience encephalitis are considered a suspected JE case. Treatment & PreventionThere is no antiviral treatment for patients with JE. Treatment is supportive to relieve symptoms and stabilize the patient. Safe and effective JE vaccines are available to prevent disease. JE vaccines are available for both humans and pigs—a strategy that could help prevent the disease from spreading on farms—but the frequency of use varies by region. There are 4 main types of JE vaccines currently in use: inactivated mouse brain-derived vaccines, inactivated Vero cell-derived vaccines, live attenuated vaccines, and live recombinant vaccines – all have been licensed and WHO-prequalified. In November 2013, Gavi opened a funding window to support JE vaccination campaigns in eligible countries. WHO recommends having a strong JE prevention and control activities, including a JE immunization program in all regions where the disease is a recognized public health problem, along with strengthening surveillance and reporting mechanisms.Travelers who are visiting Japanese encephalitis-endemic areas should take precautions to avoid mosquito bites to reduce their risk of contracting JE. For most travelers, the risk is low, but depends on the place you are visiting, the time of year, your planned activities, and the length of the trip. Personal preventive measures include the use of repellents, long-sleeved clothes, coils and vaporizers. Travelers spending extensive time in JE endemic areas are however, recommended to get vaccinated. Your doctor can help you decide if you need the JE vaccine. "

14,POLITICS,How The British Media Helps Radicalize People Against Islam,Christopher Mathias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/darren-osborne-islamophobia-in-uk-media_us_594982bee4b00cdb99cb01b9,"“Every time a newspaper prints a negative story about Muslims, ISIS leaders will be rubbing their hands in glee,” says academic Dr. Paul Baker.",2017-06-21,A woman looks at messages at the base of a wall near the scene of an attack next to Finsbury Park Mosque in north London on Tuesday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5949864d2900001f003b050a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"“I’m going to kill all Muslims.” That’s what a white man said after he plowed a rented van into Muslim worshipers leaving the Finsbury Park Mosque in north London early Monday, police allege. One man died and 11 people were injured in the incident.The next day The Times, a major British newspaper, splashed a picture of the suspect, 47-year-old named Darren Osborne, across its front page, below a sympathetic headline describing him as a “jobless ‘lone wolf.’” The accompanying subheading described him as a “father of four” with “mental health problems.” Other leading British newspapers also came under fire for their treatment of the story.The sympathetic media coverage of Osborne’s arrest is in contrast to headlines about incidents in the United Kingdom where the suspects have been Muslim.Moreover, a notable absence from this week’s headlines on the London mosque attack is the issue of radicalization, something author J.K. Rowling pointed out in a tweet Monday.That’s perhaps because there’s mounting evidence that the media itself plays a part in radicalizing non-Muslims to commit Islamophobic attacks. A string of academic studies in the U.K. have documented the wanton fear-mongering in the British media about Muslims over the past decade. And this fear-mongering, experts say, can have real and dangerous consequences. Here’s a sampling of some of the inflammatory headlines that have graced the pages of U.K. newspapers ― particularly the right-wing tabloids ― over the years:“BBC PUT MUSLIMS BEFORE YOU!” ― The Daily Star, Oct. 18, 2006. “MUSLIMS TELL BRITISH: GO TO HELL!” ― Daily Express on Nov. 4, 2010. “MUSLIM SCHOOLS BAN OUR CULTURE” ― Daily Express, Feb. 20, 2009. And the accompanying stories sometimes contain outright fabrications. In 2015, the Daily Express published an article claiming that half of Britain’s 3 million Muslims support the Islamic State. It based its claim on a deeply dubious poll, and the Express was eventually forced to delete the article. That same year, The Sun ran the headline ‘1 in 5 Brit Muslims’ sympathy for jihadis’ on its front page. The paper was later forced to admit that the article was “significantly misleading”― though it published its correction in much smaller print on page two.Dr. Paul Baker, author of the book Discourse Analysis and Media Attitudes: The Representation of Islam in the British Press, told HuffPost that such coverage can ensnare British society in a vicious cycle. “Sadly, the attack aimed at Muslims at Finsbury Park is exactly what extremist violent groups like ISIS are wanting to happen ― they want to ignite a global war and force people to pick sides,” said Baker, who is a professor at Lancaster University.“Every time a newspaper prints a negative story about Muslims, ISIS leaders will be rubbing their hands in glee ― so these journalists are inadvertently helping them,” he said. “Hate breeds more hate.”In fact, a 2010 study from the University of Exeter’s European Muslim Research Center shows that anti-Muslim media coverage had led directly to a rise in anti-Muslim hate crimes in London. “The report provides prima facie and empirical evidence to demonstrate that assailants of Muslims are invariably motivated by a negative view of Muslims they have acquired from either mainstream or extremist nationalist reports or commentaries in the media,” the study findings say.When Brits see stories about Muslims on their newspaper front pages, they’re likely to see words like “radical,” “fanatical,” “fundamentalist,” “extremist,” and “militant” in all caps or boldface. Those are the five adjectives a University of Cardiff School of Journalism report said were most used to describe Muslims in the British print media, according to an analysis of articles from 2000 to 2008. Of the stories analyzed, 34 percent specifically linked Muslims to the threat of terrorism, 26 percent suggested Islam is a dangerous or backward religion, 14 percent pushed a clash-of-civilizations narrative between Islam and the West, and 9 percent depicted the religion as a threat to the British way of life. All told, only 17 percent of the stories talked about Islam neutrally or positively as part of a multicultural British society. Researchers at Lancaster University analyzed 200,000 articles about Islam and Muslims from 1998 to 2009. They found that “for every one moderate Muslim mentioned, 21 examples of extremist Muslims are mentioned in the British press.” And in 2011, academics at the University of Leeds conducted a three-month analysis of four British papers ― the Guardian, The Independent, the Daily Mail, and The Sun ― and found that 70 percent of articles about Muslims were “hostile” in nature. “This kind of coverage, this one-dimensional coverage, almost gives people permission to hate,” Dr. Waqas Tufail, a senior lecturer in criminology at Leeds Beckett University, told HuffPost. The attack at the Finsbury Park mosque “didn’t happen in a vacuum,” he said.It happened, Tufail said, in the context of “long-term Islamophobia” in the U.K., where there is a “culture of anti-Muslim bigotry in much of the press” and in the rhetoric and actions of the government.This week’s attack at the London mosque is the latest evidence of a vicious cycle of hate in UK. Anti-Muslim hate incidents rose 530 percent in the week following the deadly May attack at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, according to Tell MAMA (Measuring Anti-Muslim Attacks), when compared to the week before. And Islamophobic attacks increased fivefold after the London terror attack in June, according to the Mayor of London’s office.Meanwhile, Osborne is in jail facing charges related to terrorism."
15,POLITICS,Alabama Won't Help Disenfranchised Citizens Understand If They Can Now Vote,Sam Levine,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alabama-moral-turpitude_us_594a8335e4b0177d0b8af45f,"“I’m not going to spend state resources"" on that effort, Alabama's secretary of state says.",2017-06-21,Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill at a 2015 rally for then-presidential candidate Ted Cruz.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/594a857629000020003b0725.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After Alabama clarified a law from its white-supremacist days that now could potentially extend voting rights to thousands, the state’s top election official said he’s not going to make any additional effort to help those affected register or understand the changes. In May, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey (R) signed legislation outlining which specific felonies constituted “moral turpitude” and would disqualify someone from the right to vote. The original law, enacted in 1901, disenfranchised anyone who had committed any crime considered to involve moral turpitude ― a broad definition that for much of the 20th Century was used to keep blacks off voting rolls.The Supreme Court found the language unconstitutional in 1985, and state lawmakers altered it to apply only to felonies. But which felonies were severe enough to disenfranchise an individual remained undefined until the new law was passed. The Southern Poverty Law Center estimated the change could affect thousands of people convicted of felonies that now won’t constitute moral turpitude. Prior to the clarification last month, more than 250,000 people were disenfranchised in Alabama, which included 15 percent of the state’s black population and less than 5 percent of its white population.Advocates praised the move, but said more work needs to be done to educate people about the change. People told by an election official in the past they were ineligible to vote may now be eligible. It’s also unclear what kind of legal process those need to go through to get on the rolls, said Artur Davis, the executive director of Legal Services Alabama.But Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill (R) told HuffPost he was unaware of people being wrongly told they couldn’t vote. While the state will continue its usual efforts to encourage people to register to vote, Merrill said he wasn’t going to make an effort to focus on those whose felony convictions will no longer disqualify them ― or may not have been reason enough to block them from registering in the past.“I’m not going to spend state resources dedicating to notifying a small percentage of individuals who at some point in the past may have believed for whatever reason they were disenfranchised,” he said. “But I am going to continue to spend state resources to promote the opportunity for all citizens to determine their eligibility and to assist them in becoming registered to vote and obtaining a photo ID so they can participate in whatever level they’d like to.”Danielle Lang, a lawyer at Campaign Legal Center in Washington representing 10 plaintiffs suing the state over the moral turpitude law, said she has a growing list of people who were disenfranchised but would now be eligible to vote under the clarified law. The reason people believed they were ineligible to vote, Lang said, is that they received a letter from the state telling them that.“This is confusion that was wrought by the state,” she said. ″Under this newfound definition, it turns out [some] do have the right to vote. I don’t see how anyone would know that unless they’re kind of legislative junkies.”People affected by the new law may have to learn about it from Legal Services Alabama and the state’s ACLU chapter, which will jointly hold at least three clinics this summer on the changes. The changes define fewer than 50 crimes ― including murder, kidnapping and rape ― as constituting moral turpitude.Still, there’s ample room for confusion. People convicted of felonies not defined as moral turpitude can apply to have their voting rights restored only if they pay paying certain fines and legal fees and meet other qualifications.“Even though there is a new law restoring the right to vote to many people who’ve been disenfranchised, that right doesn’t automatically restore itself,” Davis said in an interview. “There has to be guidance from the state of Alabama on what the disenfranchised individual has to do to literally get back on the voter list.”Merrill said the ACLU and Legal Services Alabama were better suited to contact the people who would be affected by the new law. But Lang said federal law required the secretary of state’s office to keep records of everyone who had been blocked from registering to vote, meaning Merrill could easily handle the task.“The state created this problem by having an unconstitutional and arbitrary system of disenfranchisement,” she said. They’ve taken a step to fix it. But when there are legal wrongs, there’s a responsibility to fully remedy those harms.”"
16,THE WORLDPOST,Trump's Apprenticeship Program Should Help Train Coal Miners For Solar Jobs,"Joshua Pearce, ContributorDirector, Michigan Tech Open Sustainability Technology Lab",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-apprenticeship-coal_us_594938cce4b07499199ecdfc,A relatively minor investment in retraining would allow the majority of coal workers to switch to solar-related positions.,2017-06-21,"Solar installers from Baker Electric place solar panels on the roof of a residential home in Scripps Ranch, San Diego, California. Oct. 14, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/594985ef29000020003b0509.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order that boosts American apprenticeships. It will double the amount of money for apprenticeship grants and move control of the program away from the federal government to the private sector. Often with these internships, workers are paid while being trained for a new job, so it preferentially benefits the nearly half of Americans finding it hard to make ends meet. This program could be a real boon for industries like solar, which are desperate for skilled workers, as well as existing workers trapped in declining industries.Trump has repeatedly shown great interest in America’s coal industry, which has faced a steep decline in profitability. One major American coal company after another has filed for bankruptcy, and coal is declining globally. Even China is moving away from it. The industry is shedding jobs, and it has an enormous negative impact on health. Coal is responsible for killing about as many Americans every year from pollution (about 52,000) as it currently employs (about 53,000).It is clear that coal is all but dead no matter what Trump does to help it. Coal investors can simply call their brokers to move their money to more profitable and less risky industries, but coal workers are left with pink slips and mortgages in blighted coal country. But Trump can still help the coal workers themselves by retraining them for a more profitable industry.How can a coal worker get a solar career?A study I co-authored for the journal Energy Economics provides an analysis of the need to retrain current coal workers for employment in the solar industry. In the study, we evaluated the skill sets of current coal workers and tabulated salaries. For each type of coal position, we determined the closest equivalent solar position and tried to match current coal salaries, and then we quantified the time and investment required to retrain each worker.The results show that a relatively minor investment in retraining would allow the vast majority of coal workers to switch to solar-related positions even in the event of the elimination of the domestic coal industry. This good news for coal workers should be compounded by Trump’s apprenticeship program announcement, assuming it will make retraining easier for many of them.Since the rapid decrease in the costs of solar photovoltaic technology, unsubsidized solar is now often the least expensive source of electric power, and solar deployment is rising rapidly. This is creating a lot of jobs in the U.S. solar industry, which is bringing on new workers 17 times faster than the overall economy. The solar industry increased employment by 25 percent last year — adding about as many new jobs in one year (51,000) as there are in the entire coal industry. As Tom Kimbis of the Solar Energy Industries Association pointed out in a discussion with me, “These aren’t just punch-the-clock jobs — these are careers.”As Christopher Turek, a director at Solar Energy International, pointed out, “One interesting opportunity for many of these coal miners is that many of them have transferable skill sets.” Although coal workers have skills, they still often need some retraining — just like anyone moving to a new industry. California’s solar apprenticeship program, a state program run through a private company, started in 2009, for example. There are others: one in Oregon, for example, and another through the Interstate Renewable Energy Council.There are many apprenticeship models and educational pathways to follow ― under President Obama’s ApprenticeshipUSA state accelerator grants, for example, states used funds to develop strategic plans and build partnerships for apprenticeship expansion and diversification. In areas where there are no formal solar apprenticeships, workers can be trained through an apprentice program in another field. In many states, an electrician has the qualifications required to connect solar systems to the electric grid, so an electrician apprenticeship is a particularly good career move. The Independent Electrical Contractors runs an apprenticeship program that can be accessed through local chapters.This can help real people, Turek explained: “[Solar Energy International] is headquartered in the heart of the declining Western Colorado coal country — this hits home for us. ... The good news is that they have the solar industry’s leading technical training school right here in their backyard.”Apprenticeships are not for everyone.Apprenticeships can be great for many workers — about 90 percent are gainfully employed by the conclusion of their apprenticeship — but it is not a panacea. The vast majority of Americans who can go to college, should. A typical bachelor’s degree recipient can expect to earn about 66 percent more during a 40-year working life than the typical high school graduate. In the end, college graduates (electrical engineers, for example) earn $830,000 more than those who skip college. And potential earnings rise with a master’s degree or Ph.D. America needs tens of thousands of engineers to remain competitive in the energy sector; they will be well-paid for helping modernize the grid. For some workers, apprenticeships will help make the jump to the growing solar industry. For others, a more traditional university education will provide a richly compensated career. The bottom line is workers in dying industries like coal could have a lifeline to jobs in growing industries like solar if they take advantage of retraining opportunities like the new apprenticeship program."

He discarded his tribe’s long-held rule of succession (sons of their father Abdulaziz in order of their date of birth); nudged aside the then Crown Prince (his half-brother); took the decision to appoint a prince from the next generation, a nephew (son of a full brother) as the new Crown Prince; and catapulted his 30-year old son, Prince Mohammad, to the position of Deputy Crown Prince, and the effective day-to-day ruler of the realm ahead of hundreds of senior princes in the line of succession.Prince Mohammad embraced a report from the management-consulting firm of McKinsey and Company as his blueprint for economic reform. He expanded the Saudi adventure into Yemen with troops and indiscriminate bombing of civilians. He placed an embargo (an act of war) on Qatar that threatens the future of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC, a regional security arrangement). He continues to support the oppressive minority rulers of Bahrain in their crimes against humanity. He has threatened Iran, killed an Iranian fisherman and captured two other Iranian sailors. In sum, the young Crown Prince has embarked on fundamental economic reforms at a time of low oil prices, may have initiated the breakup of the GCC, is fighting wars (or surrogate wars) in Syria and Yemen, is supporting oppression in Bahrain, and is instigating a potential armed conflict with Iran, which could eventually involve Iraq. Where is his train headed?On the reform front and as we have said before, institutional reform must be at the foundation of Prince Mohammad’s vision. Can he establish institutions (essentially the rules of the economic game) and especially a legal system that is fair and just? We believe not. His reforms are a pipe dream without any accompanying political reform. Is the Al-Saud clan willing to consider political reforms that would strip them of their “inherited rights”? We believe not, given the Al-Saud mindset, namely, that their father, grandfather, great grandfather, as the case may be, took over the land and Saudi Arabia is simply theirs. We don’t believe that reforms will succeed without political reforms, which, in turn, we believe are not even on the table.If this were not enough, the prince has even two bigger and more immediate worries. First, will the United States continue to support him in whatever he does? And second, will the roughly 10,000 Saudi princes fall behind him and obey his every command?In the past, the U.S. has made hollow pronouncements in support of human rights and representative governance, but has still continued to support its client dictators as long as they buy arms and do Washington’s bidding. The Trump Administration has put all pretensions aside to wholeheartedly embrace Prince Mohammad and the Al-Sauds. During and after his recent visit to Saudi Arabia Trump made it clear that the U.S. will sell Saudi Arabia any arms it wants, will support its surrogate wars in Yemen and in Syria, will do all it can to isolate, contain and realistically alienate Iran, and we believe that from private words Prince Mohammad believes he has U.S. military support in case of a conflict with Iran. Will the U.S. keep all these commitments, real or imagined?President Trump appears to prefer autocratic rulers to democratically elected governments, especially if they are rich and people with whom his family can do business. The Al-Sauds have always dangled money in front of those they want to coopt. We are confident that Prince Mohammad has received much verbal support for his plans and adventures from the new U.S. President or from his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, but he should keep several points in mind. President Trump has at most seven years in office, which could be shortened to three and a half years if he is not re-elected, or to a few months if he is impeached or resigns. What is important is that U.S. administrations and policies change. But Iran and Iraq will be always on the Persian Gulf. Moreover, a direct armed conflict with Iran is altogether another matter. It could entail Iraq, which would pose a serious threat to U.S. troops in light of Iranian influence in Iraq and could also mean a threat to U.S. interests worldwide. Does the U.S. have the stomach for following this young prince in a prolonged war? We believe not. Prince Mohammad should think long and hard about the extent and longevity of U.S. support before he takes even more irreversible steps.Be all this as it may, we believe King Salman has delivered a potential mortal blow to Al-Saud rule and even to some other rulers of the GCC. He has upended the succession rules that had been largely adhered to, he has initiated the direct descendant practice, he has given unprecedented power to one man and he has allowed himself to be seduced by the words of a U.S. president who cannot remain in office for ever and is most interested in business deals.While Al-Saud princes may have remained silent for the last two and a half years, this silence will be transformed to action before, but undoubtedly upon, King Salman’s death. It was one thing to have Prince Mohammad elevated to such power two years ago as Deputy Crown Prince because a new king could have stripped him of all powers. But now that he has been elevated to Crown Prince, the issue has taken on more urgency for the other 10,000 or so princes. This is made all the more dire as the young Crown Prince could break up the GCC, entangle Saudi Arabia in an armed conflict with Iran and lose U.S. backing when Trump gets cold feet or is out of office. In that eventuality, the Al-Sauds could be driven out of power and lose their position and their direct access to the national treasury, the thing that matters most to all princes given their over-the-top lifestyle.President Trump and his Middle East Czar, Jared Kushner, would be well advised not to make unintended commitments or to use ambiguous language in their dealings with the Crown Prince. Ambiguous words and polite talk could be erroneously interpreted by the Crown Prince, which could drag the U.S. into a long human and resource-draining conflict."

Most of the residents here fancy themselves progressive, so once people realized what had happened, shock and outrage flooded our local Facebook page. “How could something like this happen in our town?” many demanded. Everyone, it seemed, was surprised to learn that our streets had been crossed by people whose disdain for the LGBTQ community was so acute that they had stooped to criminality.As an LGBTQ resident, I felt only minimally comforted by the fact that such disdain resides within a meager minority of our town’s population. After the hate crime, my partner and I became much more hesitant to hold hands in our town. What if we walk past the people who stole the flags? If they hate people like us so much that they scaled a flag pole, stole from a congregation, and committed a prosecutable offense in order to express their hatred, what would keep those people from attacking my partner or me for holding hands on the sidewalk? All it would take is one person….Thanks to donations, the congregation quickly purchased another rainbow flag (along with security equipment), and two weeks later they hosted a flag dedication service, at which I spoke. A spirit of triumphant defiance pulsed through the packed room, and our town’s pro-LGBTQ ethos was powerfully displayed. At the same time, though, my spirit felt deflated by the sobering lesson of this hate crime: no matter how tolerant you think your town is, no matter how safe your space seems, it can always be infiltrated by haters. No space, however progressive, is impermeable to bigotry. That doesn’t mean we stop working to make spaces safer; it just means that we are only kidding ourselves when we think “That would never happen here.”We all know it, but many of us keep forgetting: bigotry roams. It does not stay put in the places where you expect it to be, the places many of us learned to avoid long ago. Bigotry never settles down. It is always on the move, and it could always be around any corner. (My trans friends know this far better than I do.)I came awfully close to inhabiting a safe space last year, when I joined a group called Queering Faith on Princeton University’s campus. During each of our meetings, the ten or so of us regular attendees shared our experiences, listened earnestly, affirmed each other, grew closer to each other and to our truth. One evening, a young man entered our space for the first time. He spoke kindly, smiled warmly, and seemed genuinely interested. Then he pulled out a Bible and started reading Romans 1 and asked us to respond, and suddenly what was supposed to be a safe space for queer people of faith became a battlefield, with only one person wielding weapons. And one person is all it takes. (The loved ones of the Charleston Nine know this far better than I do.)Even when bigotry doesn’t find a way into our spaces, it is never too far away. Two years ago, I attended my first Pride, and despite feeling giddy and free for much of the day, I couldn’t stop glancing at the protestors on the other side of the fence. When I left the enclosed event space, it wasn’t two minutes before a man with a megaphone pointed directly at me and called me a filthy dog headed for hell.My sister was next to me. It was her first time, too. Despite her lack of familiarity with the panoply of Pride, she was as enthusiastic as she could be about supporting her brother. Once the immediate shock of the heckler’s cruelty subsided, she turned to me and said, “I guess I’ll just have to bring my own megaphone next year!”Although there is no such thing as a safe space (i.e., a space that is impervious to those who are against us and who would do us harm), there is such a thing as safe people.And really, that’s what we need most: people we trust who will show up, walk alongside us, and fight with us when—not if—necessary. Whether or not we succeed in making various physical spaces safer, each of us can intentionally share space with safe people, and each of us can strive to be a safe space ourselves.One of my friends and mentors, Rev. Micah Bucey, speaks often about being a sanctuary: offering our bodies as safe spaces who protect and sustain the vulnerable. In our overwhelmingly unsafe world, we need every sanctuary we can get. In an unsafe situation, one person may be all it takes.And no one knows this better than I do."

So what is President Trump up to? I will avoid temptation to remind readers at any length why he likes apprenticeship. “College, except without the debt,” as former U.S. Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez called apprenticeship, can be a major boon to young Americans as well as older workers wanting to upskill or change careers. In principle, Trump’s commitment to expanding apprenticeship is a good thing, but some context is useful.Learn-and-earn approaches to education and training, as they are often called, engage employers in supporting the training of a new pipeline of workers. The best approaches and those promoted by the Department of Labor during the Obama administration, combine structured learning in a workplace with credit-bearing community college course-taking so that a student arrives at completion of the apprenticeship not just with job-related skills but with a useable transferable credential as well. In a nutshell, the best apprenticeship programs last several years, wages are paid by the employer, and the ‘student’ learns both on the job and in the classroom.While the image of apprenticeship in the United States is often associated with labor unions and blue collar work, today’s apprentices are training for the insurance industry (see Harper College in Illinois and the Swiss commercial insurance firm Zurich), or for cybersecurity where jobs at $45 an hour go begging (see Tidewater Community College and Yorktown-based Peregrine Technical Solutions, LLC in Virginia, which launched a registered cybersecurity program in fall 2016).Given a variety of economic and social forces roiling the U.S. today ― slowing productivity, underemployment, inequity of opportunity and unstable jobs ― apprenticeship can give workers and learners a leg up in the labor market while slowing the complaints of employers that workers don’t have the training and experience they need to fill their entry-level positions. After all, there’s not much an aspiring worker can do with the puzzle of needing to get experience to get a job and needing a job to get experience. Apprenticeship when done right is a win for all. In fact, my organization, Jobs for the Future, or JFF, just launched a Center for Apprenticeship and Work-Based Learning because we believe that the time is right to spread proven and promising practices and to assist those doing so. Most important in the future of apprenticeship is that opportunities expand into new areas such as health care, information technology and financial services. The Pathways to Prosperity Network, a collaboration between JFF and the Harvard Graduate School of Education, lays the foundation for these new fields by creating career-focused pathways starting in high school. SAP, the German software company, for example, is sponsoring C-Town Tech, a pathway at Boston’s Charlestown High School partnered with the local Bunker Hill Community College, where students begin college level IT courses as early as 10th grade and are well-positioned for apprenticeships and internships in the immediate future. My expertise is in the best of European vocational training for youth, especially the dual system countries ― Switzerland, Germany, Austria and the Netherlands. In those countries, starting at age 16, young people of a wide variety of academic talents and inclinations choose a mix of school and work, which turns out to be a more appealing way for a teenager to live his or her life than sitting in an academically-oriented classroom. In fact, I’m writing from Munich and am on my way to the CEMETS (Center on the Economics and Management of Education and Training Systems) Summer Institute at Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zurich, an international gathering on apprenticeship where teams from Seattle, Denver, Nepal, Benin and Chile, among others, will be studying the Swiss system and visiting apprenticeship sites with an eye toward adaptation of the Swiss system for their 16 through 19-year-olds.That President Trump sees apprenticeship and work-based learning as ways to expand opportunity for American workers is a good thing. That he put expansion under the rubric of deregulation is a mixed bag. Even the most ardent supporters of registered apprenticeship see the state and federal set of regulations that currently come along with quality control as overly complex and thus discouraging to some employers who would engage. If Trump’s review makes current regulations less bureaucratic while maintaining standards that ensure that workers get good training from skilled workplace and college teachers, then the approach will be a plus. Under the existing registered apprenticeship programs, some over 87 percent of apprentices are employed after completing training at an average starting wage of about $60,000. With around 500,000 registered apprenticeships in the U.S., this form of training has a high return on investment for workers and employers.It is worth noting that registration is not now required at all to run a homegrown apprenticeship program or learn-and-earn program. Many high schools and community colleges partner with employers to do just that. For example, Bunker Hill Community College, two stops away from my office in Boston, runs a great learn-and-earn program initiated by the Massachusetts Competitive Partnership in 2012. Today, over 100 students a semester are working 16 to 40 hours a week at $15 an hour in Boston’s major corporations and financial institutions. Many go on to work in their internship companies or get a 4-year degree. The quality of such a program is high because academic faculty and employers together agree to the curriculum, and jobs put students in situations where they are challenged to learn as well as contribute to productivity. The president’s order ― with few details yet available ― would provide financial support to a wider range of employer and training applicants than currently and appears to be favoring allowing Pell grants, which support low-income undergraduates, to go to students whether in an accredited program or not. Here’s where the problem lies. In the U.S., we have a history of problematic results from for-profit career education providers. Perhaps best known is the recent demise of Corinthian Colleges Inc, which filed for bankruptcy after defrauding many students. Weak programs prey on poorly informed consumers who too often end up in debt and without the promised credentials and jobs. The most sobering examples come from outside America. Both Australia and England have histories of apprenticeship. Australia’s system was long considered a beacon and interested edu-tourists made pilgrimages to see it. I wrote about it in my 2011 book Schooling in the Workplace. But when the Australian training market was deregulated, private providers took advantage of government funds to mount programs leading nowhere. Now the federal government has had to step in with huge fines to stem the rampant abuse that allowed students to borrow heavily and land in heavy debt without the skills required for a job.In England, the problem was different. Apprenticeship was not closely tied to educator partners so employers simply used the funds as they pleased, often to “train” current employees rather than new ones. As we say about good apprenticeship programs, students or trainees “own” their skills and can sell them in the marketplace. Apprentices are educated specifically enough to enter an occupation, but not so specifically that they are “owned” by a company and its particular needs. In 2015, the United Kingdom government published its plans to expand to around 5 million apprenticeships by 2020 and to make this strategy a pillar for developing the nation’s skills. Just a quick look at how the rollout was messaged reveals that “quality quality quality” is at the forefront of the reform.These are cautionary tales. In his announcement, Trump all but declared that employers know best what they need by way of training. While that may be true about their company needs, the same cannot be said for all employers’ commitment to students’ needs. The key will be to ensure that all apprenticeships and work-based learning programs supported through the new effort continue to meet the same high standards as currently provided through registered apprenticeship and accredited college employer collaborations. Let’s keep an open mind, but let’s also remember that a growing number of students have become savvy about the trail of bankruptcy and debt from for-profit providers. So have the attorney generals. And, of course, Trump has to deliver the dollar. That, too, remains questionable. "

The man, who died in the attack, was also carrying in his car an assault rifle, two pistols, ammunition and two large gas canisters when he rammed a police convoy on Monday.Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said the individual first received a permit to possess a gun before he was flagged to intelligence agencies as a potential militant threat. At the time there was no reason to deny him the permit, Philippe said.Philippe said it was “quite possible” the license was active at the time the attacker was on a security watchlist. Three sources close to the investigation confirmed it was.“Nobody can be happy, and certainly not me, that someone who has been flagged to security agencies can continue to benefit from such an authorization,” Philippe told BFM TV.The man was placed on France’s so called ‘Fiche S’ watchlist after he was found to belong to a radical Islamist movement, two police sources said.Individuals on the list are placed under surveillance though the intensity of that surveillance varies depending on the perceived threat the individual poses."

North Korea has said his injury was the result of a mix of sleeping pills and a case of botulism and not ill treatment, although doctors have also said there was no evidence of that either.The Warmbiers described their son in a statement following his death as a “warm, engaging, brilliant young man whose curiosity and enthusiasm for life knew no bounds.”“We choose to focus on the time we were given to be with this remarkable person,” they said. “You can tell from the outpouring of emotion from the communities that he touched ― Wyoming, Ohio, and the University of Virginia, to name just two ― that the love for Otto went well beyond his immediate family.”The University of Virginia, where Warmbier was student when he was arrested, said he would be “missed by all those who knew him.”“In particular, I know that Otto’s classmates and faculty feel a tremendous sense of loss, and he will always be an important member of the McIntire Class of 2017,” Carl Zeithaml, dean of UVA’s McIntire School of Commerce, said in a statement. “Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and all who knew this wonderful young man.”In his high school salutatorian speech in 2013, Warmbier spoke about his affinity for the TV sitcom “The Office” and described living in a small town where everyone knew everyone else and their “deep secrets and failed relationships.” But to the 123 students he spoke to, he also described a community where friendship was paramount and reruns of good times spent together would carry them through the future.“We know where everyone is going next year, we know where everyone has come from ... we know each other’s family, we know each other’s friends, we know each other’s siblings,” Warmbier said. “We know when someone is struggling, and we come together as a class to make things better.”"

And that number continues to climb.More than 3 million people have been forced from their homes in the war-torn nation of South Sudan, according to a report published Monday by the United Nations Refugee Agency. Of that group, 1.9 million are internally displaced and 1.4 million are refugees. The country is now home to the fastest-growing refugee population, ahead of Syria and Afghanistan.South Sudan became independent in 2011 but devolved into chaos when President Salva Kiir accused his vice president of plotting a coup in 2013. After a peace deal collapsed, ethnic violence spread from Juba, the capital, to the country’s rural areas. Recruitment of child soldiers, gang rape, murder and mass starvation are rampant. Afghanistan and Syria still have more refugees than South Sudan. But the number of refugees in the African country soared by 64 percent during the second half of 2016 alone, according to UNHCR’s annual Global Trends Report. Approximately 2,000 people are fleeing South Sudan every single day, and two-thirds them are children under 18.The vast majority flee across the country’s southern border into Uganda. Uganda boasts some of the world’s kindest laws towards refugees, awarding them plots of land and access to public services like health care and education.Yet the country is now shouldering a burden it’s not equipped for. The South Sudanese refugee population in Uganda swelled more than threefold, from 199,400 to 639,000, during 2016 alone, according to UNHCR. The country is now home to the world’s largest refugee camp, Bidi Bidi. Located in the northern part of Uganda, the camp opened just last September and its population already hovers around 250,000. Settlements across the area are so full that UNHCR has to keep opening new reception centers, said Amy Parodi, senior public relations manager for World Vision USA.The government said it’s worried about reaching a breaking point.“Uganda has continued to maintain open borders,” Ruhakana Rugunda, Uganda’s prime minister, said in April. “But this unprecedented mass influx is placing enormous strain on our public services and local infrastructure.”Aid organizations are providing life-saving support in Uganda, but severe underfunding has limited their reach. UNHCR operations in Uganda were only 33 percent funded last year, the report said, creating a gap of $186 million. The World Food Program was forced to cut its food rations for South Sudanese refugees in half, meaning that an adult woman is now receiving the same amount of cereal recommended for a 3-year-old. The funding gaps have led to a “desperate lack of food, water, shelter and other basic services” in Ugandan refugee settlements, an Amnesty International report published Monday said. “Support for vulnerable groups such as unaccompanied children, persons with disabilities, and the elderly, was also severely lacking.”Doctors Without Borders said Monday that it’s provided 80 percent of the population of Palorinya, a 170,000-person refugee camp, with water. “Even though we are pumping and treating record amounts of water in Palorinya, it’s always only just barely enough for the population,” said Tara Newell, the group’s operations manager for Uganda. Drought also descended on the Horn of Africa last year, worsening an already growing food insecurity crisis in countries like South Sudan. “My husband was killed in the war which, in addition to the shortage of food, made me decide to leave my home, everything, behind,” Nyawet Tut, a South Sudanese mother of five in her 30s, told UNHCR staff.The drought itself hasn’t affected agricultural production in South Sudan as much as places like Somalia. The South Sudanese “breadbasket” southern region remained relatively green and fertile throughout 2016.And yet it’s “probably the worst food crisis in the world,” said Challiss McDonough, senior regional communications officer for World Food Program in East Africa. “You’ve got people directly in the line of fire who have fled because they’re afraid for their lives. And you’ve got people who have fled because they can’t get food.” Sometimes both are happening in the same place, she added. Displacement has prevented people from cultivating their crops, McDonough added. As a result, about 100,000 South Sudanese are facing starvation, and an additional 1 million are on the brink of famine, according to U.N. estimates.There is a silver lining, experts say. Uganda’s compassion towards refugees has enabled South Sudanese newcomers to quickly begin anew.People who have been in Uganda for several months have already started abandoning the UNCHR tarps they were using as roofs for more permanent options, Parodi said.“You see them start to transition to more traditional round huts and thatched roofs, you start to see gardens growing and people starting to plant food for themselves. These plots of land [that the Ugandan government offers] are big enough that you can do that.”Want to help?

We need to get this done in 2017. We cannot let this once-in-a-generation moment slip,” Ryan said in remarks prepared for a Tuesday afternoon speech to the National Association of Manufacturers, a powerful Washington lobby group.“Transformational tax reform can be done, and we are moving forward. Full speed ahead,” he added.Major stock indexes hit multiple record highs from Trump’s November election to the end of the first quarter, on bets that he would improve economic growth by cutting taxes and boosting infrastructure spending.The tax reform debate has largely moved behind closed doors, where Ryan is trying to hammer out an agreement with Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, White House economic adviser Gary Cohn and the Republican chairmen of two congressional tax committees. The aim is to unveil tax reform legislation in September.Ryan will not delve into details about tax reform provisions on Tuesday but will describe major provisions of any major legislation including a “territorial” system that would no longer tax the foreign profits over U.S. corporations.Ryan will also emphasize the importance of permanent reforms, reject the notion that legislation should do little more than reduce tax rates and make a case for mechanisms to prevent U.S. corporations from moving income, assets and jobs overseas."
27,POLITICS,Senate Republicans Don't Really Care About The Loathed AHCA Process,Matt Fuller and Igor Bobic,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senate-republicans-ahca-process_us_5949935de4b0177d0b8a3aeb,But they might care about health care enough to vote this bill down. Or not.,2017-06-20,Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) says his central focus on the Obamacare repeal bill is lower premiums.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/594995f815000020008ff5aa.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Senate Republicans are speeding toward a vote next week on their Obamacare replacement bill, even as GOP lawmakers can’t answer simple questions about the legislation, express frustration with the brazenly secretive and closed process, and don’t appear to have the votes yet for passage.Republicans expected to get more details on their Affordable Care Act rewrite during a closed-door meeting Tuesday with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price. Instead, they got more vague happy talk from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and a speech from Price on what HHS has been doing to rein in Obamacare.With Senate Democrats badgering Republicans about how they’re ramming this bill through ― no hearings, no markups, hiding the bill from members ― some GOP lawmakers are now acknowledging that the process has been less than stellar.When Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) was asked whether this bill should be a template for lawmaking in the future, he sarcastically answered that “this is exactly the kind of legislative process our Founding Fathers had in mind,” going on to explain that he was obviously concerned the Senate may be voting on a health care bill next week that members won’t have seen.But when reminded that he could withhold his support for the legislation until the process had improved, McCain said he couldn’t “say no to something I haven’t seen.”It was a similar story with Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who told reporters that he’s advocated for an open process from day one. “But again,” Corker said, “when you’re dealing with things which are being done here in a totally partisan way ― which is understandable ― I mean, that’s the way reconciliation works.”After all their complaints about the way in which Democrats passed a second part of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 ― the first part of the legislation passed with 60 votes and was the product of more than 100 hearings ― Republicans have turned around and proceeded to use a legislative process that the Senate historian says has not been so secretive nor so partisan since World War I.And if any Republican actually cared that the Senate GOP was acting in this manner, the senator could stand up and refuse to vote for the bill until the process improves.Conversely, part of the reason the Senate is in this procedural position is because Democrats have been clear that none of them will vote for this bill, and even with the brazen GOP attempts to shut them out of the process, Democrats have struggled to mount an effective response to the legislative railroading, resorting to stunts and dilatory tactics in hopes of blocking a bill they have not seen.On Tuesday, Democratic Sens. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Brian Schatz of Hawaii took a cab to the Congressional Budget Office to search for the legislation. They ended up, as they expected, empty-handed.At a late-night Senate session Monday, Democrats decried the process on C-SPAN2, but it seemed to do little to win over their Republican colleagues or whip up the kind of outrage Republicans managed in 2010. In fact, even as Senate Republicans acknowledged the poor process, they maintained that their process was still somehow better than the Democrats’ in 2010 ― a blatant mischaracterization of how Obamacare was actually passed.But all the GOP congressional shenanigans will be for naught if McConnell can’t get the bill through his chamber. And if McConnell really is intent on a vote next week, he will have to work expeditiously to build a coalition of 50 votes ― a coalition he doesn’t appear to have at the moment among the Senate’s 52 Republicans.McConnell faces vote problems from both conservatives and moderates. Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas) have all expressed frustration with a number of provisions that they deem insufficient toward repealing Obamacare. They want a quick phaseout of the Medicaid expansion, the removal of certain regulations (like the protections for people with pre-existing conditions) to lower premiums and the abolishment of the taxes created under the Affordable Care Act. Paul has also resisted the creation of new tax subsidies to help pay for health insurance, a signal that his vote may not ever be gettable, though he and his staff have worked hard to not be written off in the negotiations.If the three conservatives stick together, they alone have the votes to sink the Senate’s chances of an Obamacare repeal. But giving in to those demands would jeopardize many more votes from other parts of the GOP conference, and McConnell has basically said the pre-existing condition protections will not be dropped from the Senate bill as they were in the House version ― a condition for the support of many Senate moderates.McConnell is basically gambling that he can get Paul, Cruz and Lee (or at least one of them) to accept a partial repeal as a step in the right direction, and he may, at least partially, be right. None of those conservatives has taken a hard line on what he needs at a minimum to support the bill.Cruz repeatedly told HuffPost on Tuesday that “the most important issue” with the health care bill is that it lower premiums. “That’s my No. 1 priority on Obamacare, because it’s the biggest reason that people are unhappy with Obamacare,” Cruz said. But asked repeatedly whether he would vote against a bill that didn’t lower premiums and kept those so-called community rating provisions that ensure sick people are charged the same as healthy people, Cruz dodged the question, again and again, coming up with new ways to restate that his central focus was on lowering premiums.That unwillingness to take a firm stance on any issue could be gamesmanship, as conservatives seek to avoid marginalizing themselves, but it also may be a recognition that they ultimately won’t be the ones who derail an Obamacare repeal.Asked if he would really stand up to President Donald Trump on this health care bill, Cruz returned to his central focus: “From the beginning, I have been very clear with the president, the vice president and with members of both houses that our focus has to be on lowering premiums.”Cruz’s refusal to be tied down may be a reflection of the political reality. He is up for reelection in 2018, and, despite his popularity in Texas, he faces stiff competition in Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-Texas), meaning he will need the Republican base’s support ― something that may have already been jeopardized with his up-and-down relationship with Trump.Lee and Paul may have more latitude to vote against the president’s wishes, but they also may be withholding support just to force the legislation further to the right. As Cruz noted Tuesday, Senate GOP leadership hasn’t decided how much of the Obamacare taxes will be repealed, and it’s still in flux how fast the Medicaid expansion would be phased out. Senators desperately want a seat at the table as those questions are sorted out.On the other side of the conference, some moderates may also be playing a similar game. From the beginning, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) has looked like one of the toughest votes to win over, and yet she has seemed more amenable in recent weeks, narrowing some of her problems with the legislation to its cuts in Planned Parenthood funding and its quicker phaseout of the Medicaid expansion. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) has also expressed similar reservations, along with some Alaska-specific issues, but she hasn’t ruled out voting for the bill.“You don’t know until you see it, right?” Murkowski said Tuesday about specifics in the bill. “What we’re trying to do is get a health care system that’s not only good for Alaska, but it’s also good for the country.”And then there are the concerns of other senators ― particularly the ones from states that greatly benefited from the Medicaid expansion. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) and Rob Portman (R-Ohio) have both shown willingness to end that expansion, but they want to do it over seven years, not the three that McConnell and conservatives favor.Just how long they would go for, and whether a shorter timeline might cost McConnell their votes, is unknown, but they, too, want a seat at the table.Which is all to say there are many Republican senators who could potentially vote no, especially if it’s clear McConnell doesn’t have the votes. Would Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.), perhaps the most vulnerable Republican up for reelection in 2018, really vote for the bill if it’s going down?McConnell has said he will put the bill on the floor with or without the votes. But a failed vote would almost certainly make it more difficult for senators to change their votes later ― a fact that may cause McConnell to pull the bill at the last minute next week.Part of the reason the House was successful in passing its health care bill was that Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) didn’t force members to go on the record until leaders were sure they had the votes. In fact, the bill may have gotten through the House because Democratic opposition let up after Republicans didn’t seem to have the votes, with leaders then able to speed the bill through the chamber once they had an agreement between conservatives and moderates.In the end, that may be the real legislative template McConnell is using.Jonathan Cohn contributed to this report."

She aims to raise $7,500 not only for the book’s printing costs but also to donate copies to public schools throughout the country. As of Tuesday, the campaign has reached 70 percent of its goal. On the book’s Kickstarter page, Reynolds points to the killing of Terence Crutcher by Officer Betty Shelby to illustrate the necessity of positive representations of black boys. In audio footage from a helicopter that hovered over the scene of the killing, a police officer is heard typecasting Crutcher by saying he looked like a “bad dude.”“This ‘big bad dude’ scared her because her understanding of Black men has been shaped by distorted images, stories, and depictions of Black men that are conjured by the media ... media misrepresentations have real and tragic consequences,” Reynolds wrote on the campaign page. “We want this book to remind little Black boys who they are and whom they come from,” she continued. “We also hope that this book illuminates the humanity of Black boys and reminds everyone that we are more alike than we are different.”The pledge levels start at $5, and each donation of $27 or higher comes with one or more copies of the book, along with other small items. Some pledge levels are named after young black men and boys who have lost their lives to police shootings or other racially charged violence.

32,POLITICS,The Underappreciated Downside Of Those Factory Jobs Trump Wants To Save,Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/factory-jobs-trump-wants-to-save_us_59482c2ce4b07499199ddc2f,"Politicians love to talk about bringing back America's manufacturing jobs. But even the good ones can have long, bad hours.",2017-06-20,President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence wave as they take a tour of Carrier Corporation in Indianapolis in December. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5949237b210000f41b33d120.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When President Donald Trump stopped the Carrier Corporation from closing its Indianapolis factory last year, he did so recognizing that manufacturing remains one of the few sectors of the American economy that pays decent wages for people without college degrees.  “My administration’s policies and regulatory reforms, tax reforms, trade policies will return significant manufacturing jobs to our country,” Trump said in February. “Everything is going to be based on bringing our jobs back. The good jobs, the real jobs.”For politicians across the spectrum, shuttered factories are a symbol of America’s diminished economic greatness. But even good manufacturing jobs come with a downside that politicians overlook in their effort to valorize them: long, terrible hours. T.J. Bray has worked at Carrier, a company that makes heating and air conditioning equipment, for 15 years. He’s among the 800 Carrier workers who will keep their jobs ― though another 500 or so are still getting laid off this year ― and is very grateful that Trump intervened on their behalf. When Carrier announced that a deal had been reached on the evening of Nov. 29, Bray was shocked. “I just came back from my daughter’s gymnastics practice,” he told HuffPost by phone that night. “NBC just called me!”Before he found out he would keep his job, he’d considered going to college for a degree in communications. Carrier workers of his seniority typically make between $23 and $25 an hour, and Bray didn’t know if he’d be able to do better elsewhere without a degree. Bray, 33, is an insulator. Every day he places a strip of fiberglass on a long metal part called a heat exchanger column, shooting five screws through pre-drilled holes to attach it to the furnace. He does that 1,120 times a day. “We work our asses off, man,” he said.His regular schedule is 10-hour shifts Monday through Thursday, though he said he is usually called in on Fridays as well. And while he tries to avoid Saturday and Sunday shifts, that’s not always possible. Bray likes his coworkers, and the job provides for his family, which includes two children aged 4 and 7. But the work is drudgery, and the long hours mean he doesn’t see his kids as much as he would like. “You miss out on so much stuff in your life because you’re freakin’ in a factory all week, and then you get one day off and on that one day off all you want to do is sleep and rest,” he said. “I don’t want to spend my life ― six, seven days a week ― in a factory and next thing I know, my kids are going to be grown up and I missed out on everything because I was too busy making money.”The length of the average workweek for manufacturing jobs was 41.8 hours as of May, compared with an average of 33.6 hours for all workers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But the data includes part-time workers, which masks how long the days really are for full-timers. The weekly pay for manufacturing factory jobs is solid, averaging $1,077 in May compared to $901 across all sectors. The advantage practically disappears when you look at hours, however: The average manufacturing wage is at $26.47 an hour, compared to $26.22 for all sectors.Compensation for manufacturing workers has declined relative to other industries in recent years. The Congressional Research Service reported earlier this year that high manufacturing wages may be a myth entirely; the average is higher because the sector tends to employ older, more experienced workers. “Contrary to the popular perception, manufacturing workers, on average, earn significantly less per hour than workers in industries that do not employ large numbers of teenagers, that have average workweeks of similar length, and that have similar levels of worker education,” said the CRS report.Chuck Jones served as president of the United Steelworkers Local 1999, which represents workers at Carrier and several other plants around Indianapolis, for 26 years before retiring last month. He said manufacturing workers end up working more than 40 hours a week because their employers would rather pay overtime rates ― which are usually 150 percent of the base wage ― than hire more staff, which would involve health and retirement benefits. While the union can negotiate contracts that protect workers in various ways, most agreements still allow employers to require overtime work.“Sometime along the line they figured out that with the benefit packages and stuff it could be cheaper if they just did extra production with overtime,” Jones said. “If you’re working 40 hours, that’s unheard of.”The contract Carrier negotiated with its union calls for 40 hours of labor per week, but the company can require employees to pick up an extra shift as long as it gives proper notice ― but that notice can come as late as the previous day, making it difficult to plan family activities on the weekend, for instance. “Time-and-a-half” pay, which is required under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act, can make those extra shifts more appealing. But it’s not always voluntary; workers HuffPost spoke to for this story said they usually expect to be assigned at least one extra shift per week. Some workers love the extra cash and hate the idea of working only 40 hours. Dean Baker, co-director of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research, a liberal think tank that has focused on blue-collar jobs, said it’s not just the overhead costs that make manufacturing firms more interested in paying overtime than hiring additional workers.  “Part of it is they have huge variability of demand and they want these workers to be there when they need them and they don’t want to hire more workers, they don’t want the overhead cost,” Baker said. The labor movement fought fiercely to shorten 60- and 70-hour weekly work schedules throughout the 1800s, and even sought a 30-hour week during the Great Depression, but there has been less organizing around this issue since then. The last major action for shorter hours may have been a 1994 strike in Flint, Michigan, when overworked United Automobile Workers walked off their jobs at General Motors for several days. They ultimately forced the company to hire more workers.Ed Roell is the president of the United Steelworkers unit at an Indianapolis factory that manufactures and bottles Gatorade. He said that 30 to 50 percent of the workers there are on the job 12 hours per day, 13 days in a row. The typical base wage is about $23 per hour. “I’ve been employed there for 23 years and it’s been this way ever since that I’ve been there,” Roell said. He and his colleagues take pride in the fact that they’re making such an iconic product ― Roell said their factory produces every Gatorade flavor ― and they also like their pay. But not all of them like their hours. “Most people there are unhappy,” he said. Spokespeople for Gatorade didn’t respond to requests for comment. Roell said the company has rebuffed efforts to secure shorter hours in contract negotiations with the union, arguing that it would require new hiring that would be unaffordable for the company. Roell, 58, said while the pay is good, he’s missed out on a lot of quality time with his friends and family. Around 2012, he bought 10 tickets to take his grandchildren on a scenic railway ride that included a staged robbery by costumed bandits, only to be robbed of the ride. “I bought the non-returnable tickets and then at the very last moment on a Friday, because the supervisor failed to keep the schedule, I ended up forced working overtime,” Roell said. As he did with Carrier, Trump also criticized a company called Rexnord for its plan to close a bearings plant about a mile from the Carrier facility. But Trump seemingly didn’t have much energy for the fight, sending only one mean tweet on the subject. Now Rexnord is moving ahead with its plan to close the factory and shift production to Mexico.Brian Reed, 45, is still on the job at the Rexnord plant, but expects to be laid off sometime this fall. He said he has no complaints about working six days a week. The hours there are similar to what workers deal with at Carrier, though the Rexnord collective bargaining agreement gives workers more leeway to avoid consecutive weekend shifts. Reed would take the shifts anyway. “I didn’t want to put up with working every Saturday, but when they pay you 40-something dollars an hour, you drag your ass in here and do it,” he said. He’s glad for the overtime wages, since with the extra money he feels he has the freedom to “be able to take a vacation, be able to go out and eat, be able to buy a new fishing pole or a new gun.” John Feltner got laid off from his Rexnord job at the end of May. He had been through a bad layoff that cost him his house in 2008, so he was dreading a second round of unemployment. But in a small way, he’s glad for a break. “It’s refreshing,” he said. “I’m not gonna have to work six, seven days a week.” "

34,POLITICS,Here’s What Happens When A President Doesn’t Have A Clear Foreign Policy,S.V. Date and Akbar Shahid Ahmed,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-doctrine-foreign-policy_us_59499756e4b0db570d3767c0,"“There is no Trump doctrine,” one expert says.",2017-06-20,"President Donald Trump looks on as he meets with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko in the Oval Office on June 20, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/594998901700001f00101f92.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Iran has fired ballistic missiles into Syria, Russia is warning U.S. forces not to fly its planes there, North Korea is testing its own missiles regularly and Western European leaders are telling their citizens they might be on their own.Welcome to the Trump doctrine ― or, perhaps more accurately, the Trump non-doctrine.“There is no Trump doctrine,” said Michael Kofman of the Center for Naval Analyses, adding that with no real clarity from the top, Trump’s subordinates will scramble to create their own, at least for their own fiefdoms. “Others are trying to define this space via leaks, quotes to the media and public statements that are probably ahead of the president.”Five months into Donald Trump’s presidency, the U.S. is escalating military engagements in the Middle East and creating conflicts with traditional allies ― all of it punctuated by sometimes-inflammatory presidential Twitter statements.On Tuesday afternoon, for example, Trump tweeted: “While I greatly appreciate the efforts of President Xi & China to help with North Korea, it has not worked out. At least I know China tried!”Neither the White House nor the National Security Council responded to queries regarding that statement. But it is precisely the sort of off-the-cuff remark that foreign policy professionals fear can have lasting and unpredictable consequences.In April, after images from the Syrian regime’s nerve gas attack on civilians appeared on TV, Trump launched cruise missiles at a Syrian air base ― despite earlier administration suggestions that it was not interested in a quarrel with Syrian President Bashar Assad, and only wanted to destroy the ISIS terror group.“The Al-Shayrat cruise missile strike was demonstrative of shooting from the hip, then trying to turn impulse into policy,” Kofman said. “This sort of brinkmanship is disconcerting.”Similarly, Trump’s tweet on Tuesday followed the death of American college student Otto Warmbier, who was imprisoned in North Korea 17 months ago for a minor theft and was returned to the U.S. comatose. Trump expressed his outrage on Tuesday morning during a visit by the Ukrainian president, saying, “It’s a total disgrace what happened to Otto. That should never, ever be allowed to happen.”The president has meanwhile expressed admiration for autocratic regimes in Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the Philippines and Russia.“The rather positive take on Russia, and a negative view of NATO have remained constants,” Kofman said.Trump’s repeated praise and apparent green light for a recent Saudi-led campaign to isolate Qatar, a small Arab nation that hosts the largest American military base in the Middle East, has worried lawmakers and Middle East experts.And the simultaneous alienation of traditional friends means that if the U.S. gets into a jam, it’s not clear which traditional ally will be eager to take America’s side.During his first foreign trip, Trump damaged relationships with Western European nations by failing to state his commitment to the NATO mutual defense clause and by announcing his intention to withdraw from an international agreement to fight climate change.NATO members had been awaiting Trump’s affirmation of Article 5 of the alliance charter, which states that an attack on one nation in the group is considered an attack on all. That language was reportedly removed at the last minute from a speech Trump delivered in Brussels last month. (Trump did state his commitment to Article 5 earlier this month, however, during a White House visit by the Romanian president.)In Sicily days later, Trump declined to abide by the Paris Agreement ― in which most nations in the world agreed to start cutting carbon dioxide emissions ― despite requests from the leaders of the other six members of the G-7 group of industrialized democracies. Upon his return to the U.S., Trump announced that he would withdraw from the accord.Both French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel have publicly said that Western Europe cannot depend on the United States and needs to be prepared to take the lead on global issues, including standing up to Russian leader Vladimir Putin.“The times in which we could rely fully on others ― they are somewhat over,” Merkel said following her return to Germany from Sicily. “This is what I experienced in the last few days.”While Trump appears to be disengaging from Europe, he has ramped up U.S. troop levels and involvement in Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen and Somalia, apparently without a clear policy ― which means U.S. interests are subject to other governments’ decisions.The most visible consequence recently has been in Syria, where pro-Assad forces have repeatedly challenged the United States and associated rebel groups in recent weeks.In what the Pentagon described as necessary self-defense, the U.S. targeted a regime-aligned drone on Tuesday. Two days earlier, a U.S. Navy pilot shot down a Syrian jet. The incident was the first time a piloted aircraft has been downed by a U.S. warplane in nearly two decades.Iran’s increasing involvement in the region is also going somewhat under the radar thus far.Following ISIS attacks in Tehran earlier this month, Iran responded by firing ballistic missiles into an ISIS stronghold in Syria this weekend. Trump has not publicly responded to that strike ― but observers fear that a confrontation there is inevitable, given Iran’s strategic goals for the region.“I’m not sure if President Trump has a strategy towards Iran, but the United States may soon find itself in a serious conflict with the Islamic Republic,” said Ali Alfoneh, an Iran expert at the Atlantic Council think tank. “Tehran constantly tests Washington’s willingness to engage in another war in the Middle East.”Russia, Assad’s other key backer, made its own move, threatening U.S. planes that fly west of Syria’s Euphrates River.The U.S. Department of Defense says it retains the right to fly where it wishes to defeat ISIS and to defend its allies in that fight.

In the months since, multiple courts have deemed the ban unconstitutional, arguing that it discriminates against Muslims. Yet Trump is still pushing strongly for the directive, filing an emergency request with the Supreme Court earlier this month and penning increasingly incensed tweets expressing his frustration with the Justice Department. Not long after Trump first announced his plans for the ban, art institutions around the U.S. responded to denounce the executive order as fundamentally opposed to values of inclusion, diversity and liberty. New York’s Museum of Modern Art made its convictions known by hanging work made by artists hailing from affected nations on its walls. The Davis Museum at Wellesley College used a different approach to convey a similar message. The museum temporarily removed all artwork made by or donated by immigrants from the museum walls. The message behind both art world protests came through loud and clear: immigrants are indispensable parts of the fabric of this country, and their contributions to American civilization and culture are invaluable.Or, as Iranian-born, New York–based artist Nicky Nodjoumi put it: “Understanding the cultural exchange is very important at this moment. And so we have this show.” The show is “Beyond the Ban,” on display at Susan Eley Fine Art in New York. A direct response to Trump’s order, the exhibition offers a lush visual argument for the benefits of inclusion, plurality and free expression, featuring work by 10 Iranian-born artists living and working in the U.S. Nodjoumi, who curated the exhibit, was born in Iran in 1942. He relocated to New York City in the ’60s and became actively involved in protesting Iran’s Pahlavi regime.“When I came to New York I worked with political organizations,” the artist told HuffPost. “I didn’t do paintings for three years; I felt like painting was not enough. But at the end I realized this is my capacity. This is what I do best.”The artist received his master’s in fine arts from The City College of New York in 1974 before moving back to Iran to teach at Tehran University of Fine Arts. There, Nodjoumi motivated his students to be outspoken in criticizing dictatorial regimes and designed political posters visualizing the ethos of the Iranian Revolution. In 1981, he returned to New York but continued to tease out the trauma of his experiences with political oppression through painting. Nodjoumi’s works are graphic but not straightforward, plopping familiar yet enigmatic images of wild animals, men in suits, long sticks and bright balloons into uninhibited backdrops. The carnivalesque images wrap political commentary in an absurd and slightly surreal fog, alluding to the eternal threats of power, tyranny and greed, untethered to a specific time or place.“I like my works to have a story, to have some drama, like they’re onstage,” Nodjoumi told HuffPost. “When I do larger scale paintings, the paint becomes dominant and takes over. I follow the rules of painting when a piece starts.”The New York nonprofit Center for Human Rights in Iran reached out to Nodjoumi to curate the “Beyond the Ban” show, with 90% of proceeds benefitting the organization. “I didn’t want all the work to address the subjects of human rights and immigration,” Nodjoumi clarified. “I thought we should let the artists do whatever they want to do. There is a diversity of subject matter in the show. All of us are immigrants, and you can see the range in our cultures and the stories.”One such artist is photographer Hossein Fatemi, who, for a series titled “Veiled Truths,” photographed 20 women through a veil ― as in, he literally draped each subject’s hijab over his camera lens. The series responded to the controversial Iranian government dictate requiring women’s heads be covered in public regardless of how they identify religiously or how they comport themselves at home.Some of Fatemi’s more religious subjects wear the hijab on a daily basis, while some of his secular subjects felt repressed by the reigning government’s enforced modesty. In his photos, strangers’ portraits are overlaid with the embellished patterns of the hijab, obscuring the woman’s identity while enveloping her in a visual mandala. The simple formula questions the limits of religious observance and political mandates, examining the imprint they leave on one’s personal identity. When selecting artists to feature in the show, Nodjoumi explained that his greatest worry was potentially endangering any participating artists.“In Iran, they don’t like my paintings,” NodjoumiI said. “If I go back to Iran, they might arrest me. When someone actively and openly criticizes the regime or asks for more tolerance, they don’t like it. It might be a problem for someone trying to go back and forth between Iran and the U.S.” And yet he’s troubled by the threats of censorship currently confronting artists in America, as well. “I’m very concerned about freedom of speech here,” Nodjoumi said. “I’m here as an Iranian American to be part of that act of activism.”“Beyond the Ban,” then, tells no singular story and advances no particular agenda. In paintings, photos and prints, the works interweave Iranian artistic traditions with contemporary Western trends and innovations. The show hopes not only to encourage reflection on how we perceive Muslim-majority nations under Trump administration, but to emphasize the role art can play in uncertain political times. “I’ve been here for a long time,” Nodjoumil explained. “I have experienced prejudice and discrimination with my work. I am familiar with being placed in a box; it’s a problem. But to be honest, I think there has been an attempt in recent years to expose more Middle Eastern artists, and that’s really great.”“Beyond the Ban” features work by Shirin Neshat, Nicky Nodjoumi, Nahid Hagigat, Shoja Azari, Shahram Karimi, Jason Noushin, Afshin Naghouni, Nazanin Noroozi, Raha Raissnia and Hossein Fatemi. The exhibition runs until August 30, 2017 at Susan Eley Fine Art.

Michaels wrote Bond’s actions had resulted in angry audience mail and threatened boycotts.The letter ordered a cessation of any political discussion or the show would be scrapped. In the post, Bond lamented that his listeners “can’t handle someone as liberal & brutally honest as I can be.”Michaels told PennLive: “I’ll make this clear and concise: Bruce resigned, we have accepted his resignation, and we wish him well. That’s basically my comment on Bruce.”Philly.com reported that WTPA owner Pat Garrett is an “unabashed” Trump loyalist who even wrote a song backing the Republican during last year’s campaign.Bond, who has generated much controversy over the decades in radio and served prison time for a check-forging scheme, said he was warned months earlier to stop talking about Trump ... or else.“I certainly didn’t want to leave,” Bond said to PennLive. “Being in that studio, it was perfect. And I’m very sad that that couldn’t continue.”h/t New York Post"

Some 500,000 foreigners traveled to Rio, purchasing the 7.5 million tickets. Accommodating this massive surge of attendees and providing transportation throughout the city proved no easy task. Preparing a city for the Olympic games often requires updating existing infrastructure, while also building completely new structures. In Brazil, $11.5 billion was spent on hosting the games, $7.1 billion of which was exclusively spent on the infrastructure of 37 venues. According to Bloomberg, in Tokyo, 45 new skyscrapers are in the process of being built in time for the Olympics, in addition to a new train station and stadium.Renowned Japanese architect Kengo Kuma has designed the Shinagawa New Station complex—the first new train station planned for Tokyo's busy JR Yamanote line since 1971. Kuma's design features a glass-and-steel roof that will resemble traditional Japanese origami. The sides of the station will also feature glass windows, with the goal of blurring the lines between the existing area and its newly created structure. Kuma and his team are also in charge of designing the National Stadium for the summer games, which will cost roughly $1.4 billion to complete.Another of the major landmarks in the process of being completed for the Olympics is three massive towers in the Toranomon Hills area of Tokyo. One of the three structures is being designed by the international architecture firm OMA. The firm, which was founded by Pritzker Prize–winning architect Rem Koolhaas, is working on building a mixed-use high-rise that combines office spaces, hotels, and retail spaces, as well as a new subway station. The location of the OMA's structure will connect commuters to other key parks of the city, including the planned Olympic village in Tokyo Bay to the Olympic Stadium. According to Shohei Shigematsu, a partner at OMA, ""This axis of activity is designed to run through the base by incorporating an elevated park, extending vertically to wrap the tower; communicating the activity of the complex at an urban scale.""When 2020 rolls around and the Olympic games commence, it’s anybody’s guess as to which country will take home the most medals.

The location of the OMA's structure will connect commuters to other key parks of the city, including the planned Olympic village in Tokyo Bay to the Olympic Stadium. According to Shohei Shigematsu, a partner at OMA, ""This axis of activity is designed to run through the base by incorporating an elevated park, extending vertically to wrap the tower; communicating the activity of the complex at an urban scale.""When 2020 rolls around and the Olympic games commence, it’s anybody’s guess as to which country will take home the most medals. One thing that appears to be for certain, however, is that Toyko will be left with a skyline full of innovative new buildings.More from Architectural Digest:126 Stunning Celebrity Homes Inside Jennifer Aniston’s Gorgeous Beverly Hills Home Go Inside a $53 Million Private Jet Gisele Bündchen and Tom Brady’s Incredible L.A.

Trump signs the National Security Presidential Memorandum on Strengthening the Policy of the United States' Toward Cuba, June 16, 2017 </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59494d791700002600101e0c.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Co-authored by Marguerite Rose JiménezThere is a poison pill hidden in President Donald Trump’s National Security Presidential Memorandum (NSPM) on Cuba that could deprive over a million Cuban families of access to remittances from their relatives abroad—a declaration of economic war on the very people that Trump claims his policy will empower.Section 3(d) of the NSPM redefines “prohibited officials of the Government of Cuba” expansively, potentially including almost a quarter of Cuba’s entire labor force. The significance: Cubans who are “prohibited” are not allowed to receive payments from U.S. persons, and that includes remittances (Cuban Assets Control Regulations, §515.570). Sec. 3.(a)(iii)(g) of the NSPM would seem to protect remittances, but it conflicts with the existing CACR ban on payments to prohibited officials.The previous regulatory definition of prohibited officials was very narrow, limited to members of the Council of Ministers and flag officers of the Revolutionary Armed Forces. The new definition proposed by President Trump includes hundreds of senior officials in every government agency, thousands of ordinary Cubans who volunteer as leaders of their local Committees for the Defense of the Revolution, and—most importantly― every employee of the Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces (MINFAR) and Ministry of the Interior (MININT).MINFAR has some 60,000 active duty troops and MININT has some 35,000 police and Border Guards, and that’s not counting their civilian employees. Military service is compulsory for both men and women, so almost every family on the island will be affected by this new definition at some point.More importantly, according to the U.S. government’s Cuba Broadcasting service, over a million Cubans are employed by the two big holding companies, GAESA and CIMEX, that report to MINFAR. If all these people are now to be considered “prohibited officials,” then a quarter of the Cuban labor force will no longer be eligible to receive remittances.For Cuban state employees who are paid an average salary equivalent to about $25 a month, cutting them off from family remittances will have a devastating impact on their standard of living. By what possible logic can a clerk at GAESA, a truck driver at CIMEX, or a private in the Cuban army be defined as an “official” important enough to be prohibited from receiving help from their family abroad?The alleged premise of Trump’s policy is to empower the Cuban people by directing U.S. funds to them, rather than to the Cuban government. Remittances are the very best way to do that because the dollars go directly to family on the island, at a rate of about $3 billion annually.President Trump could have imposed limits on remittances directly and openly, as previous presidents have done, but that would have been very unpopular in the Cuban American community, so instead he has disguised a potentially massive cut behind the small print of an obscure regulation. Now it is up to the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control to write the new regulations in a way that averts this travesty."

From being homeless in New York City to becoming one of the first and most visible transgender people on television, Isis has experienced hardships throughout her journey to becoming the woman she is today.During her interview on Hey Qween, she shed light on her transition and how it shaped every aspect of her life.“I had just gotten out of an abusive relationship and that triggered me to start getting into therapy,” Isis explains to host Jonny McGovern. “The therapy helped me get into a space where I was like ‘I’m not going to live my life for other people anymore.’”READ MORE: Naysha Lopez On Her Journey From Pageants To ‘Drag Race’“So while the therapy was for the domestic violence, it actually got me saying that I’m finally going to transition,” she adds.Isis reveals that while she was finally ready to accept her own transition, her family as not. It was then that she knew she had to leave Maryland.“At the time I was starting to go androgynous, like growing my hair out and wearing just little bit of mascara,” she explains. “And for my family, it was too my much for the house.”“I told them that I was going to New York to pursue my career as a fashion designer, but really it was to transition.”After moving to New York, Isis soon found herself in a place where she could no longer afford to live in the big city. But she knew that’s where she needed to be to continue reaching for her dreams.“I went into the Ali Forney shelter six months after moving to New York because I knew they could help me with my transition,” she explains. “I told myself that I’m going to take advantage of every opportunity that I can get as someone who is homeless.”“In New York there’s so many options for help for the Trans community. I was getting my hormones, I was at the Ali Forney Foundation shelter and I was a part of this organization called the Reciprocity Foundation which helps those who are homeless and interested in artistic careers.”READ MORE: Dita Von Teese Bares It All On Hey Qween After years of trying to establish herself in fashion design and on the runway in the underground ballroom scene, Isis found out about a photo shoot for the reality competition show, “America’s Next Top Model.”“So I guess Top Model had contacted Reciprocity about doing a homeless shoot for Cycle 10 and they wanted some of their people for the background and automatically they thought of me,” she says.“I come from the ballroom scene so I was very competitive and I was soaking everything in, even more so than the girls on the show. So eventually Mr. J would tell the other models, ‘Watch out, Isis is going to take your light.’”After that experience the producers of the show began pursuing Isis to join the next season, a task personally ordered by Tyra Banks herself.“Originally, I didn’t want to go on [Top Model] because at first I thought they were just trying to use me,” she explains. “But hearing all the praise from the other girls really solidified my feelings about going on. So when they were pursuing me, I finally said yes.”For some, the idea of living with a group of women all competing against each other while also going through your own transition sounds like a daunting reality, but for Isis she only had one thing on her mind, to win. READ MORE: Nina Bo’Nina Brown On Her Struggle With Loving Herself “I didn’t go on there to tell everybody about my transition, but one girl eventually found out and she kind of told everybody and it was this whole big thing,” she reveals.“I was focused, I wasn’t there worried about what they thought. I went on there to just win and get out of the shelter and to follow my dreams.”And while she may not have claimed the top prize, Isis did return for the All Stars season of the show and has gone on to pursue an acting career in Los Angeles. Despite all she’s gone through and all the successes she’s had in life, Isis continues to give back and is the only member of the board at the Ali Forney Foundation to have gone through the system.“It is really hard right now for Trans issues,” she says. “We keep going backwards and we really just need to work together. We can no longer not talk about race issues and trans issues.”Check out Isis King’s full interview below and for more fabulous videos head to the Hey Qween Youtube channel!

For the first twenty years, curing the disease was my main focus. Thanks to the introduction of effective treatment, the number of patients decreased. But I began to see that everyday life hardly changed for them even after being cured. They are labeled ex-patients. The stigma remains. I began to focus more on issues of the stigma that they suffer.Patients of leprosy are often abandoned by their families and communities. And even after being cured, they are not allowed to return to their community. They continue to suffer discrimination and stigma associated with leprosy. Those who once had leprosy are identified as “ex-patients.” Among the many diseases that exist, there is no other disease like this. Those who have recovered from a cold or been cured of tuberculosis or cancer are not identified by the disease they had in the past.Although I have not seen any anthropological or historical evidence, I would venture that in the history of humankind, discrimination and leprosy are very much interrelated. I have seen many persons with leprosy discriminated against, ostracized, and even abandoned by their family. Their family members are also subject to discrimination. Fearing discrimination, families sometimes throw them out or hide them away. I have witnessed this myself many times, and I would say that discrimination against leprosy is culturally entrenched around the world. Leprosy is a disease that makes us think deeply about what it means to be human. Because of discrimination, treatment is often delayed. Those who become aware of early symptoms tend to avoid diagnosis. Families sometimes hide their children away when they show symptoms instead of taking them to the hospital. In many cases, without treatment, symptoms will continue to develop, eventually resulting in disability. In this way, even though effective treatment now exists to cure leprosy, discrimination is a major impediment to early diagnosis and treatment.When I discuss leprosy and the problems related to it, I often use the metaphor of a motorcycle. The image came to me in 2004 while watching the film “The Motorcycle Diaries.” In the film, Che Guevara, a young medical student at the time, and his friend, Alberto Granado, travel across South America on a motorcycle, visiting several leprosy hospitals on the way.Inspired by their journey, I began to think of the disease and the discrimination it causes as the two wheels of a motorcycle. The front wheel represents the effort to cure the disease, and the back wheel is the fight against stigma and discrimination. The motorcycle moves forward only if both wheels are working in tandem. Where is this motorcycle headed? Our goal is a leprosy-free world. This can only be achieved by addressing both the disease and discrimination. We are nearing our goal and there is one more mile to go. But the last mile will be a long one."

But after a friend invited me to go with her to ‘Camp’ Camp, I agreed without giving it very much thought.As the time came closer, however, I began to regret my rash decision. Touted on their website as “America’s premier summer camp for LGBT adults,” ‘Camp’ Camp involved a lot of things that took me out of my comfort zone. Sharing a rustic cabin with strangers? Eating meals in a lodge with almost 250 people? All those organized activities? I’m an introvert who treasures her privacy. I’m extremely fussy about my food. I hate anyone else trying to organize my time.But I was already committed. There was no backing out.When I arrived, the first thing that struck me was the beauty of the location. It was on a lake. We were surrounded by trees. I stepped out of the car and felt the tension of the city melt away. The second thing i noticed was just how happy everyone was to be there. People were beaming, hugging, grinning. There was disco music, rainbow flags, and glitter.“Welcome to ‘Camp’ Camp!” declared a person of indeterminate gender wearing a tiara. I was handed a folder of information, then a burly lesbian offered to take my suitcases to my cabin. I must have looked as nervous as I felt because she reassured me that the week was going to be great. “You’ll have the best time ever,” she said, repeating the ‘Camp’ Camp slogan. I nodded, but wasn’t convinced.Within a short time, I met most of my cabin mates. They were warm, friendly, and had already made our simple pine cabin feel quite homey. Maybe sleeping in the same room as these women wouldn’t be as bad as I feared.At that evening’s dinner, I discovered that camp food could be a lot tastier than I’d anticipated. At the ice cream social afterwards, I chatted easily with folks from around the country and learned more about the myriad of things to do. Besides classes in yoga, dance, tennis, stained glass, and jewelry-making, I could join a kayak trip around the lake, go mountain biking or hiking, play volleyball, draw, paint, learn how to knit or how to play guitar.Much to my surprise, over the course of the week I found myself cramming in as many new activities as I could. Along the way, I met some amazing people. I had intense and engaging conversations. I laughed. I played cards on our porch with my cabin mates. I laughed. I went to the barn dance and the tea dance. At the bingo night lead by a couple of hilarious drag queens, I laughed so much that tears rolled down my cheeks. And then I laughed some more.By the end of the week, I’d gained several new friends and (thanks to that delicious Camp food) a couple of pounds. I returned home rejuvenated, despite my sides aching from laughing so much.Since then, I’ve returned to ‘Camp’ Camp five times. In subsequent years, I’ve taken it a whole lot easier than I did that first year. I usually take a couple of classes and have even made a couple of appearances in the annual Talent/No Talent Show, but mostly I relax at the beach, swim, and spend a lot of time simply hanging out (and, yes, I still laugh a lot). It’s always wonderful to see other repeat Campers, and I also love meeting the many new Campers who come each time. I haven’t gone every year, but when I don’t I miss it.After three summers as a Camper, I decided to become one of the 100+ attendees who are a part of the staff. I still get to enjoy Camp’s amazing atmosphere, but my experience as a staff member surprised me yet again. Helping to ensure that everyone has a great Camp experience makes it especially meaningful and even more fun for me. (The fact that I receive a discount on my registration fees in exchange for being on staff is more bonus than incentive.)This year, for the first time, I’ll be taking two new positions – roles that allow me to use my creative skills. I was thrilled when I was invited to take over as instructor of the writing class (a recent addition to the schedule) and to join the team of staff photographers.After that first year at ‘Camp’ Camp, I learned that impulsive decisions can reap surprising rewards. If I hadn’t jumped in, I would have missed what continues to be a consistently amazing experience. And I’d never have had the chance to experience a vacation that promotes our community’s best features and values. ‘Camp’ Camp is utterly fun and fabulous – as any LGBT vacation should be. But it also embraces inclusion, respect, acceptance, and diversity. In today’s political climate, that’s a priceless addition to any vacation.This year, as August draws near, I’m anxiously anticipating my seventh season at ‘Camp’ Camp. But unlike that first year, I know I’ll have the best time ever. And, of course, I’ll laugh a lot."

It was made with Italian speck and cream, it used the tiny dried pasta called perline, and it was – and is – delicious. So far this season, Jackie and I have (repeatedly) been eating our peas just cooked à la française with spring onions, bacon, lettuce and butter, which makes the best of dinners with grilled bread or plain steamed new potatoes. That isn’t to say pasta has been neglected: we had a variant on peas-and-perline the other day, and it was different enough to merit a place in the summer repertoire.For one thing, it used bow tie pasta – farfalle – made of fresh egg pasta. As you can see in this video from Mario Batali, these are easy to make but time-consuming. So you’d need to set aside half an hour for the task. You could buy them ready made, of course, or simply cut your fresh pasta into 1-by-2-inch strips (2.5 by 5 cm). Figure on 3 ounces (85 g) of pasta per person for a moderate main course.And instead of using cream, which can be cloying, I made a light béchamel using 1-1/2 tablespoons (20 g) of butter, 2-1/2 tablespoons (roughly the same weight) of flour and 1-1/2 cups (350 ml) of milk, plus salt and pepper. Once you’ve made a flour-and-butter roux, start with 3/4 of the milk, then once the sauce has thickened add more if necessary to attain the consistency of heavy cream (or melted ice cream – a more appealing image at the height of summer). That quantity was for three portions, as are the photographs below. I then turned the béchamel into a cheese sauce by whisking in a big handful of grated parmesan over low heat.The final difference was crucial: fava beans (broad beans) instead of peas. While still summery-green and fresh-tasting, favas have a nutty, even slightly bitter flavor and a more substantial texture than peas. They can be a nuisance to prepare – nowhere nearly as much fun as shelling peas. Get them out of their thick, cotton-lined pods however you can – some will pop open like pea pods, but they are usually more resilient and need to be torn open – then blanch them in boiling water for 30 seconds and chill them in a bowl of cold water. Now you must skin them: pierce the tough skin with a thumbnail, then squeeze to extract the beautiful bright-green beans. That part is easy and enjoyable. Happily, you won’t need more than 1/3 cup (80 ml by volume) per person.From here, proceed as for last year’s pasta and peas dish: take a small handful of smoked Italian speck cut into short matchsticks (or substitute prosciutto) and cook it gently in butter for a minute or so. Add parmesan-enhanced béchamel and simmer for a minute or two to enable the speck to flavor the sauce, then turn off the heat while you boil your pasta. When this is halfway done, reheat the sauce and add the favas – they’ll need only a moment to finish cooking – then stir in the pasta. Adjust seasoning and consistency: if the sauce is too thick, it will get cludgy on the plate, so add a little milk or cream if necessary. There’s no need to add additional parmesan at the table, though it would be polite to offer some.Fava beans are always worth the bother of shelling and peeling, but a bother it is; beyond its deliciousness, this dish has the advantage of not needing a huge pile of beans while unmistakably showcasing their unique flavor."

While still summery-green and fresh-tasting, favas have a nutty, even slightly bitter flavor and a more substantial texture than peas. They can be a nuisance to prepare – nowhere nearly as much fun as shelling peas. Get them out of their thick, cotton-lined pods however you can – some will pop open like pea pods, but they are usually more resilient and need to be torn open – then blanch them in boiling water for 30 seconds and chill them in a bowl of cold water. Now you must skin them: pierce the tough skin with a thumbnail, then squeeze to extract the beautiful bright-green beans. That part is easy and enjoyable. Happily, you won’t need more than 1/3 cup (80 ml by volume) per person.From here, proceed as for last year’s pasta and peas dish: take a small handful of smoked Italian speck cut into short matchsticks (or substitute prosciutto) and cook it gently in butter for a minute or so. Add parmesan-enhanced béchamel and simmer for a minute or two to enable the speck to flavor the sauce, then turn off the heat while you boil your pasta. When this is halfway done, reheat the sauce and add the favas – they’ll need only a moment to finish cooking – then stir in the pasta. Adjust seasoning and consistency: if the sauce is too thick, it will get cludgy on the plate, so add a little milk or cream if necessary. There’s no need to add additional parmesan at the table, though it would be polite to offer some.Fava beans are always worth the bother of shelling and peeling, but a bother it is; beyond its deliciousness, this dish has the advantage of not needing a huge pile of beans while unmistakably showcasing their unique flavor."

The U.S. responded by shooting down a Syrian Su-22 with an F/A-18E based on the aircraft carrier George H.W. Bush.Russia then announced it was shutting down a “de-confliction” communications channel set up in 2015 as a way to make sure the Russian and U.S. militaries, both operating in Syria, knew of each other’s flights to avoid accidentally attacking each other.“US shot down Syrian AF plane alleging it was targeting ‘opposition’ not ISIS. Americans forget whose country they are in,” said a tweet posted Monday by the Russian embassy in London.All of this makes for a dangerous situation, said Douglas Lute, a retired Army general and a U.S. ambassador to NATO under former President Barack Obama. “Tactical incidents and decisions can escalate quickly when there are no channels of de-confliction, no ways to mitigate risk in the common battle space on the ground and in the air over Syria,” he said.The Department of Defense argues that the Syrian Democratic Forces are not trying to overthrow Assad, and are only fighting ISIS. What’s more, an attack on those troops is essentially an attack on U.S. forces partnered with them, according to the DOD.At a Monday appearance at the National Press Club, Joint Chiefs chairman and Marine Corps Gen. Joseph Dunford said the coming days would be instructive, as the United States and its allies stand ready to start an offensive against ISIS in Raqqa.“The Russian Federation has indicated that their purpose in Syria, like ours, is to defeat ISIS. And we’ll see if that’s true here in the coming hours,” Dunford said.He added that the United States is not interested in problems with Russia. “We’ll work diplomatically and militarily in the coming hours to re-establish de-confliction,” he said.It was unclear by late Monday whether the communications channel was re-opened ― or whether it had ever been completely shut down. Russian officials said after the U.S. Tomahawk missile strikes against Syria in April that they had suspended the de-confliction channel, but it was revealed later the claim was not accurate."

A Virginia man who confronted Hassanen and her friends near a mosque in Sterling was arrested after the teen was later found dead in a pond.The teen’s friends told authorities that the driver then exited his car brandishing a baseball bat. The teens scattered when the man allegedly attacked Hassanen. The friends regrouped at the religious center shortly after, and mosque officials contacted police.Remains believed to be the missing teen’s were discovered on Sunday afternoon in a pond about two miles from the mosque, according to the Fairfax County Police Department. An autopsy will confirm identity and cause of death. Darwin Martinez Torres, 22, was arrested and charged with murder on Sunday. He is being held in Fairfax County jail, officials said.Hassanen’s murder struck close to home for many Muslim Americans, who are celebrating the final days of the holy month of Ramadan.“She was a baby,” Abdullah-Lardas told The Atlantic. “She could have been any of our children. It affects us deeply.”Podcaster Makkah Ali wrote a thread on Twitter describing her own experiences of feeling targeted as a Muslim woman and the fear many are feeling in the wake of Hassanen’s attack.“Last Friday, I also stood all night in prayer and walked with friends to a nearby diner at 2am for a pre-dawn meal,” she wrote. “Nabra is me.”"

It was the first time an American fighter jet has shot down a Syrian aircraft in the civil war, with U.S. officials saying the action was taken to defend Washington-allied forces in the area.Syria and its ally Russia condemned the incident, claiming the downed jet was targeting Islamic State militants. Both the U.S. downing of the jet and Moscow’s response are evidence of escalating tensions between the two powers in Syria, as in recent months Washington has shown an increased willingness to target Syrian President Bashar Assad’s forces. Sunday’s incident came one month after a U.S. airstrike hit a pro-Assad militia that threatened U.S.-backed forces in southern Syria.In early April, Russia similarly suspended the agreement with Washington to coordinate on matters such as airstrikes and flights over Syria ― a deal intended to limit the danger to pilots and prevent unintended conflict between the two powers. The cause then was the U.S. missile strikes on Syria in response to Assad’s deadly chemical attack in the country’s Idlib province.The agreement was reinstated after U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson visited Russia later that month.The fight to take back the city of Raqqa from ISIS has meant an increased potential for clashes between the multitude of different forces converging on the militants’ de facto capital. U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces are taking the lead in the offensive, but so are Russian-backed Syrian army forces and pro-Assad militias.As ISIS is set to be squeezed into smaller areas in Syria’s east, various factions are competing over who will hold the land it leaves behind that could further complicate the conflict. Adding to the region’s instability, Iran launched a barrage of missiles on Sunday into eastern Syria as retaliation for ISIS’s twin attacks in Tehran earlier this month. Iran’s strike was the first time the country has launched missiles into Syria since the civil war began and pulls the country deeper into it. Along with Russia, Iran has been a prominent backer of Assad’s regime and its support has helped prop up Damascus against opposition forces."

One person at the scene died but it wasn’t clear if his death was the result of the attack.Authorities say one person is dead and at least 10 are injured after a man drove a vehicle into a crowd of pedestrians near a north London mosque that had just completed evening prayers.The incident, which occurred shortly after midnight on Monday, is being investigated as a potential terrorist attack. Police said it was “too early” to determine if the victim, who was already being given first aid at the time of the assault, died because of the attack or of an unrelated issue.The suspect was identified Monday as Darren Osborne, according to several news outlets. Authorities say the man was detained by members of the public at the scene before his arrest and was later taken to the hospital as a precaution. Originally from Somerset, the 47-year-old Osborne lived in Cardiff, Wales, with his partner and four children. “I’ve seen him walking in the street but never spoken to him,” neighbor Pauline Tibbs, 48, told The Telegraph. “He seemed normal enough.”Nine people had been taken to the hospital, and two people had been treated at the scene for minor injuries.The incident occurred near the Muslim Welfare House, a community center down the road from several local mosques, according to the U.K.’s Muslim Council.

Macron himself was practically unknown a year ago. But amid a fracturing of support for France’s traditionally powerful parties, En Marche successfully presented itself as a party able to transcend left-right political divides to bring reform. En Marche created both a presidential and a parliamentary campaign that mimicked the campaign of then-U.S. Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) in 2008 ― with young candidates pledging change and a large grassroots movement of volunteers getting out the vote. Behind the scenes, the parallel was even more explicit, as Macron employed a political consulting firm called Liegey Muller Pons to bring U.S.-style voter outreach strategy and data collection methods reminiscent of Obama’s 2008 and 2012 campaigns into French politics.The consulting firm’s founders, Vincent Pons, Arthur Muller and Guillaume Liegey, met while at Harvard and MIT and had spent time as canvassers for Obama’s data-driven ground game. While volunteering and observing how the Obama campaign ran, they began to note its extensive use of data, door-to-door canvassing and recording of information from voters. Pons, who went door-to-door in New Hampshire in 2012, told HuffPost he was struck by the level of professionalism and technology in Obama’s campaign as compared to French elections. Pons, Liegey and Muller focused their firm on taking some of the methods they’d witnessed in the U.S. and bringing them back to France.For Macron, Liegey Muller Pons developed an algorithm based on census data and past election results to help En Marche pinpoint neighborhoods in France that were indicative of the country as a whole. Macron’s party then sent tens of thousands of volunteers to speak with potential voters in those areas during 2016, and used these visits as a kind of mass focus group to determine what issues the electorate cared about.“The effort was not meant to persuade and mobilize voters to support [Macron],” Pons, an assistant professor at Harvard Business School, told HuffPost. “The intention was instead to have a discussion with voters and bridge the gap between politics and voters.”En Marche recorded tens of thousands of conversations, using the resulting data to craft Macron’s policy platform and communications strategy. It also planted an early seed in key neighborhoods and helped build a base of volunteers and staff that it could use in its official election campaign this year. Liegey Muller Pons provided analysis on this data to further inform the campaign’s strategy.Pons believes that the process of canvassing and voter engagement outside of the election cycle ― something not previously done in France ― allowed Macron to reach disillusioned citizens who would have otherwise ignored last-minute appeals to vote. It also created an image of a party willing to hear the grievances of voters, even before they were formally asking for a vote in return.En Marche and Macron ran on a platform that combined centrist, pro-European Union policies with promises of reform and a change from establishment parties. Unlike the more radical campaigns run by the far-left and far-right candidates, which attracted a high percentage of the youth vote, En Marche received an almost even distribution of voters across age demographics. The party did especially well in major cities and with educated voters.“The success of En Marche shows that you can also provide a powerful answer by having someone who has reasonable ideas, progressive ideas, but who brings a change simply because he doesn’t have a large political background and is going to present a number of new faces and new candidates,” Pons said.Macron, a banker and former Socialist minister, came from relative obscurity to upend French politics, defeating established party candidates and far-right leader Marine Le Pen to win the presidency last month. But even after his win, Macron still needed a parliamentary majority in order to avoid a gridlocked government and a diminished presidency.En Marche fielded more than 14,000 applications from people seeking to run for Parliament. Around half of the party’s 526 candidates are new to politics, and 266 of them are women. La Republique En Marche candidates ended up easily securing a majority on Sunday, as projections showed the party and its centrist ally the MoDems on pace to secure at least 355 seats out of the chamber’s 577.Even as low voter turnout in parliamentary elections took some sheen off the strong showing, the results still suggest that Macron’s party will have the numbers to enact the wide-ranging reforms promised during the campaign.But public backlash to some of Macron’s pro-business reforms is likely, and the low turnout is not a good sign for French enthusiasm toward its current politics. France’s powerful trade unions have in the past rallied millions of people to the streets over proposed policy changes, and the unions have cautioned Macron against pushing through labor reforms too swiftly.

With spending surpassing $40 million last week, the contest has become the most expensive House race in U.S. history. Trump himself appeared at a fundraiser for Handel back in April, praising her as “incredible” and depicting Ossoff as “someone who is going to raise your taxes to the sky and destroy your health care.”Vice President Mike Pence also hit the campaign trail for Handel earlier this month. Over the weekend, Price and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, Georgia’s former governor, appeared with Handel at a rally.Turnout in Tuesday’s election is expected to be high. More than 140,000 voters participated in early voting, indicating huge interest in the special election.With recent polls showing Ossoff narrowly leading Handel in the traditionally GOP district, Republicans are hoping to stave off defeat. Democrats, meanwhile, are hoping to capitalize on a groundswell of anti-Trump activism and finally achieve a victory after losing previous congressional special elections this year.In April’s first-round election, Ossoff fell just a few thousand votes short of winning the seat outright.Tuesday’s race is also seen as a referendum on the GOP’s efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare.Trump’s tweet that Democrats want to block “good healthcare” appears to contradict his assessment of Republicans’ health care legislation last week. Trump reportedly told Senate Republicans, who have been crafting their Obamacare repeal bill behind closed doors, that the House version of the bill was “mean” and implored them to pass a “more generous” version.UPDATE: 5 p.m. ― On Monday afternoon, Trump tweeted about the race again, attacking Ossoff and referring to the fact that the Democrat does not currently live in the district."

Instead, anti-coal protesters stormed the 44th Geneva Association conference at a ritzy hotel in San Francisco, plastered the bathrooms with slogan stickers and slipped fliers under the doors to executives’ rooms. A plane toting a banner reading “unfriend coal” circled the high-rise where the executives held their closing dinner and cocktail party.  The activists’ demands were twofold: Insurance companies should divest from coal projects and stop underwriting the fossil fuel. Insurers have raised the alarm on the risk posed by climate change in recent years, forming international coalitions aimed at preparing for the increased floods, storms and heatwaves that come with a warming planet. But of the 16 companies on the board of the Geneva Association ― the insurance industry’s think tank ― just one told HuffPost it cut off both funding and insurance for coal companies.AXA Group, France’s largest insurer, in 2015 announced plans to divest from companies most exposed to coal activities. This April, the firm said it would no longer offer property or casualty insurance to mining companies or utilities deriving 50 percent of their sales from coal.“Coal is often a low-cost form of energy, and is widely available to a large proportion of the world’s population,” the company said at its annual shareholder meeting on April 26. “However, coal is also the most carbon-intensive energy source. AXA, like many investors, believes coal both poses the biggest threat to the climate and its business is the most likely to be constrained.” On the opposite end of the spectrum is XL Group, whose chief executive, Mike McGavick, is the Geneva Association’s current chairman. His Ireland-based firm has refused to divest from coal companies and continues to cover them with casualty and property insurance, calling such moves “nonsense.”“It’s too large a part of the economy,” he said two years ago at an insurance industry forum. “It’s too many of the investible opportunities out there and the reality is that we would be failing our shareholders if we weren’t investing in a prudent way.”Other firms have followed McGavick’s lead, including Japan’s Tokio Marine, the United Kingdom’s Lloyd’s, Brazil’s SulAmérica Seguros, Canada’s Intact, Switzerland’s Zurich Insurance Group and the People’s Insurance Company of China, known as PICC. (Berkshire Hathaway, the U.S. insurance behemoth led by billionaire Warren Buffett, underwrites and invests in coal, though the firm is not on the Geneva Association’s board.)Italy’s biggest insurance company, Assicurazioni Generali Group, has yet to divest or curtail coverage for coal, but a spokesman told HuffPost it was completing an internal audit to determine the scope of its exposure to the fuel. “Generali is currently performing an in-depth analysis of its exposure to coal infrastructure both from an investment and underwriting perspective,” Matthew Newton said by email. He did not respond to questions about when the audit would be complete, but suggested it could be a first step toward the company divesting and ending insurance policies for coal.Coal divestment campaigns have gained steam in recent years as hundreds of cities and universities pull their pension funds and endowments out of the industry. The fuel faces fierce competition from natural gas and renewable energy, and its use is on pace to peak in the next decade. But scientists warn that a business-as-usual approach to the industry that’s disproportionately responsible for planet-heating emissions rapidly causing Earth’s climate to change jeopardizes any hope of averting the worst effects of global warming. Peter Bosshard, who coordinated last week’s protest for the activist group Unfriend Coal, said convincing insurers to abandon coal would hasten the industry’s demise. “It’s the one critical fact that’s been left off the hook,” Bosshard, who works for the global warming advocacy group the Sunrise Project, told HuffPost on Monday. “Insurance is a precondition for any major project to go ahead. It’s one thing to divest, but more important is to stop insuring coal.” Some companies don’t offer any insurance for coal projects. These include New Jersey-based giant Prudential, Canada’s Manulife Financial, the United Kingdom’s Aviva and the Netherlands’ Aegon. Aviva and Aegon also have moved to pull money they manage out of coal companies.“We decided last year to strike coal mining off our investment list,” Dick Schiethart, an Aegon spokesman, told HuffPost by email. “We have added companies that derive more than 30% of their revenues from thermal coal mining to our exclusion list.” Germany’s Allianz, France’s SCOR and Switzerland’s Swiss Re similarly have committed to divest, but have stopped short of cutting off insurance coverage for coal-heavy clients. In 2015, Munich-based Allianz imposed stricter environmental standards on insurance for industrial firms.“Allianz sees itself as a partner supporting our customers on a journey to a low-carbon economy, for example by providing them with our technical expertise,” Anja Rechenberg, an Allianz spokeswoman, told HuffPost by email. “That’s why we will continue to insure utilities and mining companies when they show an adequate sustainability performance or suitable risk mitigation strategies.”None of the other firms responded to HuffPost’s request for comment on Friday.“Given the clean energy transition underway, all insurers should assess their risk exposure to carbon-intensive fossil fuel industries ― including oil, gas and coal ― and disclose this information, along with their plans to reduce their fossil-fuel risk exposures, to industry regulators and other stakeholders,” Cynthia McHale, insurance director at the sustainability shareholder advocate Ceres, told HuffPost. “Coal rapidly is being replaced and eclipsed by clean, renewable energy. The market growth opportunities are with renewables, not coal.”This article has been updated with comments from McGavick, Aegon, Allianz and XL Group."

Instead, anti-coal protesters stormed the 44th Geneva Association conference at a ritzy hotel in San Francisco, plastered the bathrooms with slogan stickers and slipped fliers under the doors to executives’ rooms. A plane toting a banner reading “unfriend coal” circled the high-rise where the executives held their closing dinner and cocktail party.  The activists’ demands were twofold: Insurance companies should divest from coal projects and stop underwriting the fossil fuel. Insurers have raised the alarm on the risk posed by climate change in recent years, forming international coalitions aimed at preparing for the increased floods, storms and heatwaves that come with a warming planet. But of the 16 companies on the board of the Geneva Association ― the insurance industry’s think tank ― just one told HuffPost it cut off both funding and insurance for coal companies.AXA Group, France’s largest insurer, in 2015 announced plans to divest from companies most exposed to coal activities.

Last week, that included getting down and dirty to rescue 10 motherless ducklings trapped in a Queens storm drain.Acting on a report from a concerned nature lover at the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge, police located the ducklings in a parking lot storm drain near the North Channel Bridge.Members of the NYPD Emergency Service Unit and the U.S. Parks Police worked together to open the storm drain and rescue the tiny birds one by one, reported the New York Daily News. The last duckling reportedly took some coaxing before someone could finally grab him.But there was one thing police couldn’t do for the little ducks: Locate their missing mother. So the gang is now being cared for by National Parks Service biologist Bill Parker.The ducklings are in good health and are expected to live. They’ll be returned to Jamaica Bay when they’re big enough to survive on their own."

Jordan Vows To Fight For Change: 'I Am Philando Castile',Taryn Finley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/michael-b-jordan-philando-castile_us_5947d834e4b06bb7d274a2f5,"""I don’t have the answers but I know I’m going to be a part of the change,"" the actor said.",2017-06-19,Michael B. Jordan is speaking out about the verdict ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5947ebf01600002200116dc2.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Just days after former Minnesota officer Jeronimo Yanez was found not guilty in the death of Philando Castile, Michael B. Jordan is speaking out about the acquittal.The “Black Panther” actor expressed that he felt “helpless” but vowed to take action in an Instagram post on Sunday. The image he used was an illustration of Castile and a quote from his mother next to a list of 14 other black people who died as a result of encounters with police or a neighborhood watchman but never received justice. “They want us to feel helpless & right now I feel it,” Jordan wrote. “How do we unify? Where do we turn? What do we do? How do we fight? How do we stand? I don’t have the answers but I know I’m going to be a part of the change, and not just today, everyday until we see real change ... I am Philando Castile.”Castile’s case is the latest in which a police officer escaped conviction. Yanez pulled Castile’s car over in July 2016 after saying over a police scanner that he intended on stopping the 32-year-old because his “wide-set nose” looked like that of a robbery suspect’s.When the cop stopped him, Castile informed him that he had a licensed gun in the car, according to his girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds. Yanez told him not to reach for it. Castile said that he was reaching for his identification papers, as instructed, Reynolds said. Yanez then shot Castile seven times while his seatbelt was on, with Reynolds and her daughter watching. Reynolds livestreamed the final moments of Castile’s life. Yanez testified in court that he was scared for his life and “had no other choice.”In a press conference after the verdict, Castile’s mother, Valerie, shared her hurt and anger about the decision.“The system in this country continues to fail black people and will continue to fail us,” she said outside the courtroom. “My son loved this city, and this city killed my son. And a murderer gets away.”"
63,HEALTHY LIVING,Baltimore's Top Doctor: Why Aren't We Treating Gun Violence Like A Health Crisis?,Lauren Weber,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/baltimore-health-commissioner-we-talk-to-patients-about-ebola-why-not-gun-violence_us_5947d777e4b0f15cd5bcd20a,"""The science is clear that violence is a health issue, that violence is a public health issue,"" Dr. Leana Wen says.",2017-06-19,"Leana Wen, health commissioner for the Baltimore City Health Department, talks about the effectiveness of contraception for public school students.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/594814401600002200116e59.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Dr. Leana Wen, Baltimore’s health commissioner and an emergency room physician, wrote a moving op-ed last week after a gunman opened fire on a congressional baseball practice. In it, she highlighted the daily horror of gun violence the medical community faces.Wen has long argued that gun violence is a public health issue ― a medical emergency without a prevention plan.“Medical professionals are trained to stanch bleeding, stitch wounds and patch up broken bodies,” she wrote in her piece for The New York Times, titled “What Bullets Do To Bodies.” “We are good at our jobs; most gunshot victims survive their wounds. But every day, we are plagued by the question of how to prevent these injuries in the first place, when the damage is so extensive from weapons so readily available.”Wen spoke to HuffPost on Monday about why she believes gun violence is a public health issue, and what Baltimore is doing to prevent it. The latest news about House Majority Whip Steve Scalise’s condition is that he has been upgraded from critical to serious, but he was at “imminent risk of death” when he arrived at the hospital. Why was this kind of single gunshot wound so life-threatening?I don’t want to speculate on the tragic incident involving the congressman. I’ll say that in general what I’ve seen in the ER is that when you have an assault-style rifle or an injury or gunshot wound from an assault-style rifle ― such rifles tend to discharge at much higher velocities than handguns. And depending also on the type of bullet that’s used, it could be a type of bullet that causes fragmentation of the bullet and also causes something called cavitation, which is when it’s not just a single path. It’s not like a knife where there’s a single path of injuries ― there’s significant damage around that entry point as well.As I talked about in the article, it’s not just the bullet itself that’s the problem ― it’s the injury caused by the bullet. And if the bullet then expands inside the body or if it’s shot at such a high velocity that it ends up damaging other vital organs and blood vessels and other structures, then that damage can be extremely dangerous and the wound can be such that it’s irreparable.In your piece, you spoke about the aftermaths of gunshot wounds that go unnoticed after the blaring headlines about shootings. Can you elaborate on what happens after, when a patient begins the long road to recovery?We think about gunshot wounds as death vs. survival, and yes, for my patients, even if they are to survive ― and there is a high rate of survival following gunshot wounds, thankfully, because of our medical advances ― we still have to consider the potential for lifelong consequences.There could be lifelong consequences of spinal damage resulting in paralysis. I’ve seen many patients go through limb amputations. Because of the nature of the gunshot wound, it could be such that it fragmented their entire bone or because of blood loss. Many patients who have intestinal perforations and other irreparable wounds have to wear colonoscopy bags for a lifetime.And so many of our patients end up getting addicted to opioid medications because of chronic pain and are also in and out of hospitals for a variety of physical, as well as mental, conditions. These are all the human aspects of survival that we have to consider when looking at the human cost of gunshot wounds. A HuffPost piece actually ran with the same title as your piece. It focused on Dr. Amy Goldberg, who is the chair of Temple University’s Department of Surgery in Philadelphia. She, too, has spoken out about the horrific aftershocks of gun violence and the shattered lives it leaves behind. Why do you think more medical professionals are chiming into the debate?There is a hesitation from the medical community to get involved in issues that are potentially politically tinged. Anytime we talk about guns, there is an element of partisanship that unfortunately comes into the conversation, which is part of the reason why I wrote this article. This is not an article with a political bent. This is not an article with a partisan bent.I wanted to share what it is that we see in the ER, because these are important lessons for everyone to know. It’s important for medical professionals to be aware of it, but it’s also important for people. I hope that individuals who own guns who are potentially at risk for a gun injury will also think about the potential consequences, including these life-changing, life-altering, life-threatening consequences.What has the response been so far to your piece?I’ve had a number of people write on all sides of the issue. People have posted a lot of comments on Facebook, Twitter, over email. A lot of people shared that they didn’t know exactly what happens, and that this piece was difficult to read. It was also difficult to write, because I had to relive many of these moments that, frankly, a lot of us would prefer to not think about ― the moments that patients died under our care.These are the most difficult things that we have to face as physicians ― when patients die under our care despite our best efforts. People have written that they’re glad to read about it and learn about it, despite it being difficult to process.Other people have commented on the cost implications, too. In our city that’s facing an epidemic of violence, one homicide will cost society at least $1.3 million. For one gunshot wound involving the spine, medical costs alone will be well over $500,000. The total cost of treating gunshot wounds in our city over the last five years is at least $80 million. In addition to the human cost, there are economic and societal costs too.Of course, there are individuals who do not understand the intention of the Times piece and think that it is making a political statement when it is not intending to, so the responses has been varied as expected. So many times, we as physicians, nurses and medical health professionals will talk to each other and commiserate with each other about the horrors we’re seeing in the ER, about the horrors we see in our medical practice. By doing that, in a way, we normalize it. We see this as what we encounter in our daily lives, when actually these are not normal things at all.It is not normal for our patients to have these severe wounds that are inflicted by what I called in the article these “tools of total bodily destruction” ― that’s what these weapons and these bullets are doing. And I wanted to share that with the broader audience to let people know that this is what we see. The devastation and destruction is occurring every day in our communities.Can you talk about the prevention initiatives you have in place in Baltimore to address gun violence?We have three strategies that we use to address violence in our city, and specifically gun violence. From our perspective in the Health Department, violence is unequivocally a public health issue. Violence is something that affects people’s health. And it’s a public health issue as it’s similar to a contagious disease in that it spreads from person to person. It can be prevented. It can be stopped. It can be treated.We use three methods. The first is Safe Streets, which is where we hire individuals from the communities they serve ― many of whom are ex-offenders, previously incarcerated for gang activity and even gun violence. They walk the streets of the city, and they interrupt violence where they see it occurring. They have a relationship and respect from the community. They emphasize the slogan for Safe Streets: “Stop shooting, start living.” They offer alternatives to violence and start changing cultural norms around violence as well.Safe Streets has been in our city for about 10 years ― it’s been deemed by a study by Johns Hopkins as one of the most effective public safety strategies. Last year, our Safe Streets employees mediated over 800 conflicts, 80 percent of which were deemed likely or very likely to result in gun violence. The areas that have Safe Streets have seen a 27 percent reduction in shootings, and it’s also changed the norm for our youth .That’s our first strategy, to stop violence at the time that it’s occurring through these violence disrupters. Our second strategy is recognizing that there is a cycle of violence and trauma that we have to aim to treat mental health conditions, to treat addiction, because these are also underlying what is causing violence.We have an aggressive overdose prevention program to save lives from drug overdose. We also are increasing our treatment for individuals with a disease of addiction and with mental health disorders. And we have programs to treat trauma as well, to address trauma in our children and to build trauma-informed care in our communities.The last and third strategy: Because we see violence as a public health issue, we have to go upstream as early as possible. So we see other initiatives like reducing lead in our children and providing glasses to kids also as violence pre-prevention strategies.And finally, do you believe the Centers For Disease Control and other public health institutions should speak about gun violence as a public health crisis?Those of us involved in medicine and public health, we are scientists. We should use data and evidence and science when making our decisions. The science is clear that violence is a health issue, that violence is a public health issue. Therefore, we as doctors, scientists and health professionals should be talking about these issues and also should be getting as much information as we can, including through research.It doesn’t make sense to me that there is a federal ban on research that’s related to gun violence. It doesn’t make sense to me that there are states that have tried to impose gag orders on physicians to even talk to their patients about gun safety as has happened in Florida, among other states.These are things that we should be even more open to speaking about and engaging with our patients and the broader community about. In the same way that we wouldn’t hesitate to talk to individuals about Ebola, about measles, about heart disease ― those are also health conditions that are affecting our patients and potentially could be taking their lives. Gun violence is such an issue as well.This interview has been edited for clarity and length."

The areas that have Safe Streets have seen a 27 percent reduction in shootings, and it’s also changed the norm for our youth .That’s our first strategy, to stop violence at the time that it’s occurring through these violence disrupters. Our second strategy is recognizing that there is a cycle of violence and trauma that we have to aim to treat mental health conditions, to treat addiction, because these are also underlying what is causing violence.We have an aggressive overdose prevention program to save lives from drug overdose. We also are increasing our treatment for individuals with a disease of addiction and with mental health disorders. And we have programs to treat trauma as well, to address trauma in our children and to build trauma-informed care in our communities.The last and third strategy: Because we see violence as a public health issue, we have to go upstream as early as possible. So we see other initiatives like reducing lead in our children and providing glasses to kids also as violence pre-prevention strategies.And finally, do you believe the Centers For Disease Control and other public health institutions should speak about gun violence as a public health crisis?Those of us involved in medicine and public health, we are scientists. We should use data and evidence and science when making our decisions. The science is clear that violence is a health issue, that violence is a public health issue. Therefore, we as doctors, scientists and health professionals should be talking about these issues and also should be getting as much information as we can, including through research.It doesn’t make sense to me that there is a federal ban on research that’s related to gun violence. It doesn’t make sense to me that there are states that have tried to impose gag orders on physicians to even talk to their patients about gun safety as has happened in Florida, among other states.These are things that we should be even more open to speaking about and engaging with our patients and the broader community about. In the same way that we wouldn’t hesitate to talk to individuals about Ebola, about measles, about heart disease ― those are also health conditions that are affecting our patients and potentially could be taking their lives. Gun violence is such an issue as well.This interview has been edited for clarity and length."

So when a reporter for GQ asked the director about the Bechdel test, the feminist litmus test for film, her response was, in a word, confusing. “The what test?” Coppola said. The reporter repeated the name. “I’ve never heard of that. What’s that?”Because gender equality can be tough to conclusively measure, one of the ways critics have done so is through the Bechdel test, which asks two simple questions: Do two women characters have names? And do they speak to each other about something other than a man? The idea represents some of the work that won creator Alison Bechdel, an American cartoonist, the MacArthur “genius” grant in 2014. If you’ve paid attention to entertainment journalism in the past five years, you’ve probably run across the term more than once. Although the film has been hailed for a progressive cause, Coppola has also been the target of criticism over her subjects: women, yes, but only extremely pale types. Her response to a BuzzFeed question about why she didn’t include a black woman character present in both the source material and the 1971 version of “The Beguiled” also drew some criticism over erasure.

Chris Dodds, who has worked as a garage assistant supervisor with Columbus City Schools since 2004, reportedly posted the hateful message on a Facebook page for the 2017 Columbus Pride parade and festival last week. In the since-deleted post, Dodds said he hoped Friday’s festival, which has drawn more than 500,000 people in the past, “turns out like the Boston Marathon,” a pointed reference to the 2013 bombing that killed three people and injured several hundred others.Take a look at a screenshot of the alleged post, courtesy of Change.org, below. The post quickly prompted an online petition calling for Dodds’ dismissal. “This is completely unacceptable,” organizer Tom Neffs wrote, “and we need to take a stand and demand that this man not be allowed to spread this hate to the children in affiliation to our school system.” The petition has since drawn over 46,000 supporters as of Monday afternoon.School officials addressed the news in a Facebook post Thursday. Scott Varner, who is a spokesman for Columbus City Schools, told The Columbus Dispatch on Friday that the district “values and celebrates its diversity” and was “working with authorities to address this matter and [Dodds’] actions.” “We do not tolerate discrimination of any kind,” Varner said. “We are currently working toward Mr. Dodds’ termination.”In an email to HuffPost, Columbus City Schools Communications Manager Jacqueline D. Bryant confirmed that the school district was planning to terminate Dodds, and noted that more than 500 teachers, staff, students and family members joined the city’s Pride Parade on Saturday in the end. On Saturday, school officials shared some jubilant images of those teachers and students marching in the parade on Facebook, and their praise seemed even more profound in the wake of the controversy.

69,QUEER VOICES,Historic Gathering Of API Transmasculine People Set For August In California,"Willy Wilkinson, ContributorAuthor of the Lambda Literary Award-winning book Born on the E...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/historic-gathering-of-api-transmasculine-people-set_us_59484bc8e4b04d8767077b13,"""“There’s no representation of us in the media. We’re going from one set of stereotypes to another set of stereotypes.""",2017-06-19,"<p>Organizers Willy Wilkinson, Chino Scott-Chung, and Jai DeLotto</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59484dcc15000038194e7212.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"API TransFusion, the first Asian and Pacific Islander transmasculine retreat, will take place August 4-6 at a private retreat site in Northern California.The retreat will welcome all ethnicities and cultures that fall under the API umbrella, and all identities, bodies, and presentations along the female-to-male spectrum, including trans, gender nonconforming, gender expansive, non-binary, and other identities. Organizers Jun Chan, Junior Claros, Jai DeLotto, Min Matson, Chino Scott-Chung, and Willy Wilkinson hope the retreat gives community members an opportunity to feel less isolated, build community, discuss issues relevant to our lives, share resources, and elevate our self-acceptance and self-confidence.“It’s very exciting. We’re coming together as a group and being a force of nature,” said Chino Scott-Chung, 56, a Chinese Mexican American retired San Francisco firefighter who writes about trans identity. “I feel very privileged and honored to be part of that conversation about who we are, how we identify, and why that’s important.”Jun Chan, 29, a queer-identified, transmasculine Chinese American who designs platforms to improve healthcare services, spoke to the sense of isolation that many feel. “In the queer community I don’t see representation of API people in support groups. There’s a disconnect. You have to hide that part of yourself, keep it locked away.”Racial stereotypes contribute to this sense of isolation. Junior Claros, a Filipino trans engineer, spoke to the pervasive idea that “we’re not considered attractive, sexual, or masculine.” Chan added, “There’s no representation of us in the media. We’re going from one set of stereotypes to another set of stereotypes. As Asian women, we’re assumed to be submissive, nice, weak, push-overs. As men, we’re not considered manly. We’re assumed to be submissive, quiet, nerdy, not as assertive. It’s not something I can talk about and have people really understand.”Organizers emphasize that the retreat will be an inclusive space for all identities on the transmasculine spectrum. Jai DeLotto, 40, a licensed clinical social worker who is Northern Italian and Sri Lankan, stated, “We want to create a space that’s safe for everybody to express their gender.” Scott-Chung agreed, adding, “I’m not on hormones and haven’t had surgery, but I have been living as a man for twenty-plus years.”Asian and Pacific Islander transmasculine communities, like other marginalized groups, are dealing with multiple challenges in this destabilizing and perilous political climate. “The issues that API transmasculine people experience are similar to what trans people of color face broadly: high poverty rates, high unemployment, lack of access to healthcare, and mental health issues,” said Kris Hayashi, 42, a queer Japanese American transmasculine person and the executive director of Transgender Law Center (TLC), the largest nationwide organization dedicated to advancing the rights of trans and gender nonconforming people.“There is a particular opportunity in this moment because this is a national gathering that will bring together trans API leaders from across the country,” said Hayashi. “Because of the increase in hate violence and deportation, and the decrease in services, now more than ever people need support to do the work we’ve always done, and create a space like this to build community with each other and know that we are not alone.”This historic retreat will host a number of groundbreaking workshops, many of which have never been done for this audience. Hayashi and TLC staff member Elliott Fukui will conduct a workshop on leadership development and organizing resources. Potential workshops will address API transmasculinity, trans adoptee experience, mixed heritage experience, writing and storytelling, meditation and mindfulness, surgery specifics and access, sex and relationships, employment and careers, and family (including family of origin, families of choice, parenthood, and prospective parenthood).This last issue is a frequent discussion point in this family-oriented community. Said DeLotto, “How were we raised female within our cultures, and how does that affect us? What are our role models of masculinity? I was expected to serve my father tea, not my brother, because I was seen as female. Transitioning for me is being able to shed that feeling that I need to cater to others.” Added Scott-Chung, “How do we deal with misogyny in our own cultures and the reverence that our cultures have for boys? How do we negotiate that history when we come out to our families?”Claros spoke to the expectations of our families and communities. “Those of us who stay connected with our Asian and Pacific Islander families may have a stronger sense that we and our actions reflect on our families and the broader community.”Min Matson, 40, a Korean adoptee, healthcare and life sciences management consultant, and chair of the TLC board, will present a workshop on the unique transmasculine adoptee experience. “I didn’t grow up in an Asian family, so I didn’t face some of the cultural challenges that some guys did. I’m excited to connect with people who are like me.” Organizers are aware of approximately twenty transmasculine adoptees around the country and are enthusiastic about hosting this groundbreaking workshop.The retreat will take place August 4-6 at a trans-affirming, private retreat site in Northern California, a two and half hour drive from San Francisco and Oakland. Cost is $250 for two nights’ accommodations and six meals. Half-price scholarships are available, thanks to funding from the Red Envelope Giving Circle and the Trans Justice Funding Project. Workshop facilitators will receive half off registration. Organizers will help coordinate participants’ transportation from Bay Area airports and other locations.In addition to workshops and community circles, participants can hike, swim, relax, and create spontaneous workshops. Matson spoke to the profound, life-changing experience of this kind of gathering. “I hope that the workshops serve as a valuable resource to help people tap into another story, talent, and interest. I hope people feel that they get to be free with their bodies, and have a safe place to swim. A safe place to shed your insecurities for a few days can do wonders for people.”Registration is open until July 20. Scholarship applications and workshop proposals will be accepted until June 30. Donations towards the scholarship fund are greatly appreciated.

This was the tipping point for decade long tensions between Doha and its neighboring countries to simmer over.The news report released statements by Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. In these statements, which Qatar maintains are false, the Emir called Hamas ‘the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people” and said that the country shares “strong relations” with Iran, a region archrival of Sunni-majority Saudi Arabia.The report was widely publicized in other Arab countries despite Qatar reiterating that it was fake and that the Emir never spoke the statements attributed to him.Meanwhile, the leaked emails of the Emirati envoy in Washington seem to show his country s long-running desire to counter Qatari influence.These two events triggered what we now know as the Gulf crisis: On 9th June, nine countries cut off diplomatic ties with the tiny but rich state of Qatar. These nations include three members of GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council), Bahrain, UAE and Saudi Arabia. The rest of the countries are Egypt, the Maldives, Mauritania, Yemen and the U.N.backed government of Libya. Four additional countries – Djibouti, Jordan, Senegal and Chad – have downgraded their ties with Qatar.Qatar’s foreign policy has always been rather different than that of the rest of the Gulf States. While Bahrain largely follows Saudi Arabia’s foreign policy, Qatar has diverged from other members of the GCC. After the Arab Spring, Qatar aligned itself with Islamist political parties such as Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood which has been declared as a terrorist group by Saudi Arabia and United States. Qatar’s state funded news network Al Jazeera also seems to support these groups as champions of democracy. Qatar was also amongst the most active backers of Islamist fighters in rebellions in Syria and Libya. This coupled with the fact that Qatar enjoys close ties with Tehran, has bothered the Saudi led bloc.Egypt also considers the Brotherhood to be dangerous. During the 2011 Arab Spring, Qatar backed the Brotherhood and the protestors against the then-President Hosni Mubarak. It supported Morsi, Egypt’s first democratically elected leader and a member of the Brotherhood. This stands in stark contrast with Riyadh whose support was for Mubarak and currently backs President Abdel Fateh el-Sisi , a former military leader. Qatar’s news agency Al Jazeera has been widely criticized of supporting the Brotherhood during the Arab Spring. Several Al Jazeera journalists were detained in Egypt for supporting Mohammed Morsi.Qatar has also been accused of backing Yemen’s Houthi rebels which is a startling claim given that Qatar, until the day before the crisis, was part of the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthi rebels, who are allegedly backed by Iran and ex-President Saleh.Middle Eastern expert Hassan Hassan explains that the countries of the region can be divided into two camps: “one that seeks to advance its foreign interests through support of Islamists, and one whose foreign policy is guided by opposition to the rise of Islamists.” Qatar falls into the first category while the Saudis and Emiratis fall into the second category.Several Arab countries have accused Qatar of sponsoring terrorism, including al Qaeda’s Syrian affiliate Nusra Front, Afghan terror group Taliban, and Hamas. However, even Saudi Arabia has been accused of financing Nusra Front.President Donald Trump’s recent visit to Riyadh also seems to have emboldened Saudi officials. On Tuesday after the crisis, Trump tweeted about Qatar, linking it to funding of radical ideology. Doha shares good diplomatic ties with Iran. The ownership of South Pars/North Dome Gas Condensate field, the world’s largest natural gas field, is shared by Iran and Qatar which unites the countries in wealth. Qatar became the world’s largest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG) owing to the shared gas field. Doha has struggled to maintain good relations with the GCC and Iran simultaneously.The crisis shows deep rooted and complex divisions in the Middle East which the west often tries to downplay by portraying it as nothing more than tensions between Saudi-led Sunni bloc and Iran led Shiite bloc.There seems to be no easy solution to the crisis in the foreseeable future. The crisis could lead to food and water shortages in the country because of the blockade imposed by its neighbors. Doha has called this a “collective punishment”. Intermarriages between Qataris and nationals of other GCC countries have resulted in families being torn apart because of Qatari citizens being ordered to leave Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and UAE within 14 days. Qatar’s air travel came to a halt after the Gulf neighbors decided not to fly their airlines to Qatar. Qatar was forced to suspend its flights to the countries that imposed the blockade.It’s hard to gauge what happens next. Oman and Kuwait, the remaining GCC countries not involved in the crisis, may try to exert what limited power they have to reach a compromise between the four Gulf States caught up in the crisis. The United States may intervene as well considering that Qatar hosts the largest US military base in the Middle East though Trump’s series of tweets seems to go against the instincts of the American foreign policy. Qatar has significant fiscal reserves, enjoys good relations and political support of Erdogan and Turkey and is a key energy partner for Russia and China. Saudi Arabia and Emiratis may soon realize that cutting off ties and attempting to isolate Qatar is not as easy as they thought.Originally published on Dunya News"
