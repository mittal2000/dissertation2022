However, some of his bandmates already have, and he’s not happy about it. Last week, Schon shared a post on Facebook in which he called out three of his bandmates ― keyboardist Jonathan Cain, bassist Ross Valory, and frontman Arnel Pineda ― who visited the White House last Thursday.Schon, a founding member of the band, seems to believe the publicized meeting was done with the intention of exploiting the Journey brand, and it doesn’t sit well with him. He also claims it was arranged without his knowledge. “Journey was not there ― 3 individual members were Cain Valory and Pineda whom I found ... Tours are done all the time but it could have been privately,” he wrote. “I had no prior knowledge of this from anyone. Not band members or Managment. This clearly shows no respect or Unity, just Divide.” Schon also expressed his frustrations about the whole situation on Twitter throughout the weekend, replying to fans who showed their support. At one point, he said the White House photo op went against everything the band stood for, adding that Jonathan Cain “changed radically.” Cain is married to Paula White, the woman who has been cited as Trump’s spiritual advisor; she was also present at the president’s January inauguration. Schon maintained that politics do not belong in a band before writing, “I won’t be dealing with any more toxic shit,” though he didn’t necessarily confirm he would leave the band. He did, however, say he’s “taken it by the horns and who ever doesn’t like can leave.” HuffPost has reached out to a representative for Journey and will update this post accordingly. "

It also prohibits countries from increasing the current numbers of North Korean laborers working abroad, bans new joint ventures with North Korea and any new investment in current joint ventures.“We should not fool ourselves into thinking we have solved the problem. Not even close. The North Korean threat has not left us, it is rapidly growing more dangerous,” U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told the council.“Further action is required.

Still, negotiating new measures typically takes months, not weeks.North Korea has been under U.N. sanctions since 2006 over its ballistic missile and nuclear programs. The new measures came in response to five nuclear weapons tests and four long-range missile launches.The United States negotiated with China for a month on the resolution, then expanded negotiations to the full council on Friday.Washington, frustrated that China has not done more to rein in North Korea, has threatened to exert trade pressure on Beijing and impose sanctions on Chinese firms doing business with Pyongyang.“We had tough negotiations this week,” Haley told reporters. “I think that the Chinese realized that the United States was going to push, but they responded and we appreciate how they cooperated with us during these negotiations.”Liu, asked about U.S. negotiating pressure, said China has been consistent on trying to achieve denuclearization, peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and “to re-launch negotiations to achieve this end.”He told reporters China was “opposed to any unilateral sanctions outside the agreed framework set by the U.N. Security Council resolutions.”RUSSIA/U.S. COOPERATIONIt had been unclear whether strained U.S.-Russia relations would hamper negotiations on North Korean sanctions. On Wednesday, Washington imposed unilateral sanctions on Moscow to punish Russia over accusations of interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea.“We are not hostages to our relations when we have to work together on issues which are far more important,” Russia’s Nebenzia told Reuters.The new U.N. resolution adds nine individuals and four entities to the U.N. blacklist, includingNorth Korea’s primary foreign exchange bank, subjecting them to a global asset freeze and travel ban.“I would think China and Russia signed on the sanctions hoping that they would force North Korea back to the negotiating table,” said Thomas Byrne, president of the New York-based Korea Society. “However, North Korea will try to evade the new sanctions.”The new resolution completely bans North Korean exports of coal. In November, the Security Council capped the North’s coal exports at $400 million annually. China, its largest buyer, halted imports in February.A U.N. diplomat said North Korea had been expected to earn an estimated $251 million from iron and iron ore in 2017, $113 million from lead and lead ore, and $295 million from seafood. The diplomat said it was difficult to estimate how much North Korea was earning from sending workers abroad.A United Nations human rights investigator said in 2015 that North Korea had forced more than 50,000 people to work abroad, mainly in Russia and China, earning between $1.2 billion and $2.3 billion a year for the government.Joseph DeThomas, a former State Department official who worked as an adviser on Iran sanctions and on previous rounds of North Korea sanctions, said freezing foreign labor would be difficult to enforce.“Overall I doubt that $1 billion number.

The unnamed woman, who was allegedly drugged, assaulted and held captive in a suitcase, has since been released and a suspect arrested in the case. The woman, whose modeling agency in the UK had organized what they believed was a legitimate photo shoot for her in Milan, went to the Italian city on July 10, CNN reported. The next day, she went to the site of the “shoot,” where she was attacked by two men and drugged, said authorities.Italian prosecutor Paolo Storari told the BBC that the model was “doped with ketamine” before being locked into a suitcase and loaded into the trunk of a car. She was then driven to a house located in a remote area outside the city of Turin, police said. There, the model was allegedly handcuffed to a wooden dresser and kept captive for six days.The woman was reportedly released from the house on July 17 and brought to the British consulate in Milan. A 30-year-old Polish national named Lukasz Herba, who accompanied the woman to the consulate, was arrested there on kidnapping charges, reported CNN. It remains unclear what prompted the woman’s release and why Herba had brought the woman to the consulate.Police say Herba had demanded a $300,000 ransom from the model’s agent that he said would stop an online auction for the woman. He claimed to be working on behalf of the “Black Death group,” a dark web organization that has been linked to the illegal trafficking of people, weapons and drugs.A ransom was not paid for the model’s release, police said.Police said Herba may have organized several other line auctions of abducted girls, though authorities had yet to verify the authenticity of those transactions.According to Al Jazeera, an investigation into the model’s kidnapping is ongoing in Italy, Poland and Britain. Authorities said they were searching for at least one other person related to the woman’s abduction. Citing the Global Slavery Index, Al Jazeera noted that about 46 million people worldwide lived in some form of slavery last year."

After besting his Chinese rival, Zulpikar Maimaitiali, on points in a title fight on Saturday in Mumbai, the 31-year-old Olympic bronze medalist extended an olive branch to his opponent ― by offering to return the belt he’d just won.“I don’t want this title. I will give it back to Zulpikar,” Singh, who retained his WBO Asia Pacific super middleweight title and snagged his rival’s WBO Oriental super middleweight belt, told reporters after the fight, according to The Guardian. “I don’t want tension on the border. It’s a message of peace. That’s important.”According to the Times of India, a general feeling of goodwill was apparent between the two boxers following the fight, though it’s unclear whether Maimaitiali was aware of Singh’s peace offering at the time. The paper reported that the Chinese boxer, who had been wearing a traditional hat from the northwestern region in China where he’s from, gave Singh the headgear to wear and embraced his opponent. But Singh said that when he offered Maimaitiali the belt, “he couldn’t understand it.”“I wanted to give a message by giving away the belt so that the tension at the border between India and China reduces. The environment at the border is very bad at the moment. ... I hope [the Chinese] media and people will get the message,” Singh told NDTV.The boxer later reiterated this message on Twitter:China and India have been butting heads for several weeks over a territorial dispute on a plateau near the mountainous Indian state of Sikkim. Both sides have blamed the other for trespassing on territory that is not theirs.Bhutan and China have both claimed the plateau, known as Doklam, as their own. The plateau is not part of India, but is strategically important to that country. Doklam “is extremely close to a very vulnerable stretch of Indian territory that effectively connects the bulk of India to its northeastern states,” Shashank Joshi, senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London, told CNN.On Thursday, China said India had been “illegally” building up troops and repairing roads on its territory ― a claim India denies. A report over the weekend suggested China was considering military action to force India out of Doklam. Even before his fight on Saturday, the dispute with China had clearly been on Singh’s mind. Speaking to the Hindustan Times last week, he said the standoff would certainly “impact” the match.“It is, at the end of the day, an India-vs.-China bout and given the current situation, I feel a sense of responsibility to make India proud,” Singh said."

The U.N. commission was established in August 2011, just a few months into the conflict, to investigate human rights violations during the war. It was tasked with both probing the occurrence and circumstances of alleged crimes, as well as identifying the perpetrators.Del Ponte joined the body in 2012. She has previously served as chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.The U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Syria has interviewed thousands of witnesses since its inception, publishing several reports about human rights violations in the country. But members of the commission have never been given access to Syria, and none of the reports have led to prosecutions. At the Lucarno Festival, Del Ponte said she felt the commission was being used as an alibi for inaction and lacked political support. She argued that without a special tribunal to prosecute the situation in Syria, reports would remain without consequences since countries like Russia and China, who have veto power in the U.N. Security Council, have consistently blocked meaningful action. Even before announcing her resignation, Del Ponte had been openly critical of the U.N. Security Council’s position on Syria. “Nothing happens, only words, words and more words,” Del Ponte told the BBC recently about the international community’s response to reports of war crimes in Syria.“We thought the international community had learned something in Rwanda. But no, they have not learned anything,” Del Ponte said at the film festival. On Friday, the commission issued a dire warning that more than three years after the start of the war, the international community still hasn’t addressed the self-described Islamic State group’s ongoing genocide against the Yazidi minority.The commissions two other members, Paulo Pinheiro and Karen AbuZayd, said in a statement released on Sunday that Del Ponte had informed them in mid-June of her decision to leave the body. “The Commission wishes Ms. Del Ponte well in all her future endeavors, particularly as a tireless advocate for the cause of accountability and bringing perpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity to justice,” the statement said.

Since those sharing this article have tended to be people and organizations that I respect, my own response has been tempered—even though I recognize in the overview of teaching writing the same problems with edujournalism I have been confronting for many years.Other than Jim Horn’s challenge that Goldstein takes the “blame the teachers” route and former NCTE president Douglas Hesse’s letter posted at his blog, many in the writing and teaching writing community have posted and shared this article without challenge, and several have added that Goldstein does a more than adequate job covering the landscape of teaching writing.The irony here is that this article on the failures to teach students to write is a model for both typical mainstream journalism and everything wrong with mainstream journalism: the breezy recounting of a complex field within which the journalist has no real experience or expertise and the “both sides” coverage of complex issues that treats “sides” as somehow equally credible.The key problems in this piece can be unpacked in a few claims made by Goldstein.Early, Goldstein asserts (without any link to evidence):Focusing on the fundamentals of grammar is one approach to teaching writing. But it’s by no means the dominant one. Many educators are concerned less with sentence-level mechanics than with helping students draw inspiration from their own lives and from literature.What is profoundly garbled here is a conflating of what the field of teaching writing shows through research and what teachers actually do in their classrooms.The reality of 2017 and how students are taught writing is best reflected in a comment by former National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE) president Lou LaBrant from 1947:A brief consideration will indicate reasons for the considerable gap between the research currently available and the utilization of that research in school programs and methods. (p. 87)Isolated grammar instruction has been shown to have almost no transfer into student writing, and George Hillocks (among others) detailed that traditional grammar exercises could even make student writing worse.However, I invite Goldstein and others to visit classrooms and, better yet, simply read through the Connected Community’s Teaching and Learning Forum (NCTE) where weekly English teachers voice their continued commitment to “[f]ocusing on the fundamentals of grammar.”I want to come back to this point with another example below, but next, Goldstein wanders into the fatal flaw of edujournalism with this splash of evidence:Three-quarters of both 12th and 8th graders lack proficiency in writing, according to the most recent National Assessment of Educational Progress. And 40 percent of those who took the ACT writing exam in the high school class of 2016 lacked the reading and writing skills necessary to successfully complete a college-level English composition class, according to the company’s data. Poor writing is nothing new, nor is concern about it. More than half of first-year students at Harvard failed an entrance exam in writing — in 1874. But the Common Core State Standards, now in use in more than two-thirds of the states, were supposed to change all this. By requiring students to learn three types of essay writing — argumentative, informational and narrative — the Core staked a claim for writing as central to the American curriculum. It represented a sea change after the era of No Child Left Behind, the 2002 federal law that largely overlooked writing in favor of reading comprehension assessed by standardized multiple-choice tests.The relentless and uncritical faith in what standardized tests tell us is one of the great problems with edujournalism across all discussions of education, but with writing, this is particularly problematic since standardized testing of writing is universally horrible, lacking validity and itself providing the context for why the teaching of writing is in fact inadequate.Again, Hillocks has carefully analyzed that one of the most negative influences on teaching students to write has been the high-stakes testing movement grounded in ever-new standards. Teachers and their students have become shackled to state-level and national tests of writing that make writing to prompts and conforming to anchor papers as well as rubrics supersede any authentic writing goals that were endorsed by important movements such as the National Writing Project (a key focus of Goldstein’s article).As I noted earlier, the irony is that a professional journalist’s piece in the NYT fails to provide the sort of credible evidence that many would expect as essential in student writing.Just as test data are accepted on face value, Goldstein embraces an even worse source for her foundational claim of blame:The root of the problem, educators agree, is that teachers have little training in how to teach writing and are often weak or unconfident writers themselves. According to Kate Walsh, president of the National Council on Teacher Quality, a scan of course syllabuses from 2,400 teacher preparation programs turned up little evidence that the teaching of writing was being covered in a widespread or systematic way.Kate Walsh and NCTQ have no credibility in writing instruction, and worse yet, their so-called research on teacher education has been exposed as ideologically corrupted and methodologically inept, especially the syllabus studies noted by Goldstein.Finally, I want to link this misplaced use of Walsh/NCTQ and the first point above.Goldstein’s article flirts with some very important issues about why the teaching of writing does continue to be mostly inadequate across the U.S. But the entire piece could have been saved by simply seeking out the research on that exact problem, research that already exists in a highly accessible form—for just one example, Applebee and Langer’s Writing Instruction That Works: Proven Methods for Middle and High School Classrooms.Applebee and Langer have conducted multiple studies over many years examining what actually happens in terms of writing instruction in classrooms as well as what teachers know and how that is reflected in their practice.Broadly, as I highlighted in a review for Teachers College Record, Writing Instruction That Works concludes:In Chapter Two (Writing Instruction in Schools Today), Applebee and Langer (2013) lay the foundation for what becomes the refrain of the book: “Overall, in comparison to the 1979–80 study, students in our study were writing more in all subjects, but that writing tended to be short and often did not provide students with opportunities to use composing as a way to think through the issues, to show the depth or breadth of their knowledge, or to make new connections or raise new issues…. The responses make it clear that relatively little writing was required even in English…. [W]riting on average mattered less than multiple-choice or short-answer questions in assessing performance in English….

It was an eye opening look into the mindset of this administration and those pulling the strings. The public reaction to it was another example of how divided we are as a country and exactly how misguided many have become.When Acosta compared the verbiage in the new bill to “The New Colossus,” the poem written on the base of the Statue of Liberty, Miller attempted to rewrite history by stating the words were added later. In doing so, he was insinuating that the poem and its meaning had no bearing on American history or policy.I grew up in the ’80s, and I remember “Liberty Weekend.” That was the celebration and rededication of the Statue on its 100th anniversary. I remember that poem being read more times than I could count, I also recall having to memorize it in the 5th grade. Ronald Reagan, during that event, said that America was made up of “a special kind of people from every corner of the world, who had a special love for freedom.” He understood the fabric and DNA of this country.He understood what made us.Make no mistake, America is in distress. We are on the verge of forgetting our past and forfeiting our future to the ideology of white nationalism. We live in a nation founded, built, and loved by immigrants, yet today its part of our history many wish to deny. By attacking and demonizing the immigrants of today, we till up the roots of those who came before that made us who we are.Miller’s disregard for the words is shared by many in the administration. His disdain for the poem is also being celebrated by many who support this president. We have slipped so far in the last 24 months that not even the Statue of Liberty is sacred to many amongst us anymore. A statement that would have gotten you punched in the face by the average Tea-Party “patriot” a few years ago is now a rallying cry to keep out brown people.Had an advisor to President Obama said something similar about the words “In God, We Trust” on our nation’s currency, the outrage on the right would have been swift and vitriolic. There would have been thousands of people in American flag shirts with crosses in one hand and Obama effigies in the other marching on the Mall of Washington.Bigotry against immigrants isn’t itself a new phenomenon in America. It’s the overt disdain for immigration that permeates this administration and its supporters that are so shocking. For the justification for this brand of nationalism to be coming from the oval office is not only disheartening it’s disturbing.The ease at which thousands can disregard generations worth of precedence and American tradition only proves how many steps we have taken backward as a nation. Not only does “Give me your tired, your poor,” no longer remind us of who and what we were, but the prevailing sentiment among many is also that those words never had any meaning to the fabric of America, which is patently and reprehensibly false!Saying that the new views on immigration are about safety and security is one thing, but to discredit over two-hundred and forty years of American history is another. Justifying bigotry by rewriting history will not and should not stand.―-Photo: flickr/Ana Paula HiramaThis post originally appeared at: The Good Men Project"

The team that was targeted in their photo, Kirkland American Little League from Washington ― which Atlee defeated 1-0 on Friday ― took their place instead.“It’s a travesty for these girls,” Atlee manager Scott Currie, told the Richmond Times-Dispatch on Saturday. “Yes, they screwed up, but I don’t think the punishment fit the crime.”The photo, which shows six uniformed girls making the gesture in a dugout, has since been deleted. The offending girls’ head coach also instructed his players to apologize to Kirkland’s team in person.It wasn’t enough for the Little League International Tournament Committee, however.The team’s behavior was “inappropriate,” Little League spokesman Kevin Fountain said, adding that it violated the organization’s policies, “regarding unsportsmanlike conduct, inappropriate use of social media, and the high standard that Little League International holds for all its participants.”Atlee head coach, Chris Mardigian, later speaking to RVA Sports Network, said that the girls posted the photo in response to several incidents of harassment that they had received from Kirkland members during the tournament.During Friday’s game, a Kirkland baserunner was ejected for stealing signals from the Atlee team and giving them to their batter. A Kirkland coach was also ejected from the game, the Times-Dispatch reported.Kirkland went on to lose Saturday’s title game to Poland, Ohio, 7-1, the Seattle Times reported. Though most on social media appear to agree that the girls’ behavior was wrong, there are mixed responses to the committee’s decision."

But they can be intimidated, too.That’s why a group of 50 bikers in Dekalb County, Indiana, used their image to help one sixth-grade student teach his classmates a lesson: Bullying is bad, not badass.The bikers, brought together by Brent Warfield of the social group United Motorcycle Enthusiasts, on Tuesday escorted 11-year-old Phil Mick to his first day of class at Dekalb Middle School.Phil rode onto campus on the back of Warfield’s bike. Warfield, director of the biker club and sales manager at KDZ Motorcycle Sales & Service, brought the group of bikers together after Phil’s mom, Tammy Mick, told him Phil had been bullied at school last year.Mick said she discovered that other kids were hitting and punching her son when Phil came home with bruises. “It tore my heart out,” Mick told HuffPost of the bullying.Warfield stepped in to help after Mick said that Phil had talked about killing himself, according to Fort Wayne news station WANE.“I said, ’Well, get with me. I’ve got a bunch of big-hearted bikers that are good friends of mine,’” Warfield told the station.He used Facebook to ask his biker friends for help escorting Phil to his first day of school, writing that he wanted to make a positive impact on Phil and show other kids that “bullying isn’t cool.”“Help spread the word that bullying leads to teenage suicide,” he added. “Let kids know we are there for them!”Phil and his parents had breakfast with the bikers on Tuesday before the big ride, according to WANE. The group also said a prayer before forming their caravan. Jon Strack, a biker in the group who is also known as Bear, said that teachers, students and administrators were all excited to see them and that they welcomed Phil’s biker friends with smiles and waves.Phil was all smiles too.“The excitement we felt as Phil looked at all the bikes there for him was amazing,” Strack, who also the president of Jingoes Motorcycle in Columbia City, told HuffPost. “The feeling we experienced was a joy in being able to help this young man.”Strack said the bikers of United Motorcycle Enthusiasts learned that the impact their group can make on their local community is never unappreciated. He said he thinks Phil will cherish memories from that day for a very long time.“Our message to anyone who bullies someone else is this: What you are doing is never without consequences. The impact you are having in the people’s lives you pick on is one that will stay with them forever. There is more to life than getting joy from others’ pain,” Strack said.With Phil’s first week of school behind him, his mom says she sees a dramatic change in her son. “He comes home smiling after school,” she said.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story incorrectly identified Warfield as owner of KDZ Motorcycle Sales & Service.

On the ride up to Maine, the home of Camp Caribou, we kvelled about how much fun he looked like he was having in the photos, laughed about the list of items he had forgotten to pack (like his toothbrush), and wondered whether or not he would want to go to camp next year. So many of our friends’ kids were doing different things this summer—a robotics program, a physics program, specialty sports camps, or traveling—all totally great ways to spend a summer. But camp feels different, and so important. Especially these days.Growing up, neither Jeff nor I could afford glitzy summer camps. So when we went to visit them a few years back, we thought they all looked pretty amazing (and we wanted to stay and be campers). Each one had sports galore, outdoor adventure programs, a gorgeous lake with tubing, waterskiing and sailing, woodworking and of course, color war! The hardest part was going to be choosing. So as good parent-consumers, we did as much research as we could. And when it looked like Camp Caribou was in the lead, we spoke to the Lermans (Caribou’s owners for three generations), as well as parents of current campers, and of course watched the camp video. In the end, we chose it because something felt different. What stood out more than anything was not its sports facilities, food, or bunks – it was its culture and values. One of the things the folks in charge often say is, It’s cool to be nice at Camp Caribou. And it’s true!As we pulled into camp this year, I noticed something that may have always been there, but it caught my attention this time (maybe because I am writing a book about culture and values?!). Attached to the trees that flank the long windy road into the camp are flags flying for each of the camp’s values: kindness, fun, friendship, sportsmanship, and spirit.And I said to myself, hmmmmm….I thought of all the businesses I talk to and work with and how much help they need bringing their human to work. And I thought, they sure could benefit from some good old-fashioned camp values.So here goes:Kindness. Who wants to work in a company where people are not kind? Certainly not me. Workplace incivility is linked to higher turnover, employee burnout, psychological distress, and decreased productivity. At Caribou, kindness starts at the top with Bill and Martha Lerman and their children. They “walk the walk” and even celebrate those kids who exemplify kindness at the camp fire. Imagine a workplace where the leaders exhibit, expect, and celebrate kindness? And then offer you a s’more?Spirit. It’s not news that millennials want to work for a company that has strong company values, which is good for all of us. They are reminding us all how important it is to be part of something bigger than ourselves and contribute to the world in a meaningful way. In other words, companies that have spirit are winning the race for talent. Cultivating such a spirited culture isn’t rocket science, but it does take discipline and hard work. Just ask Daniel’s counselors. Friendship. One of my favorite studies is the Gallup study that shows that having a “best friend” at work leads to increased productivity and employee engagement. Which is particularly important given the increase of technology in the workplace and the fact that left to our own devices (excuse the pun), we are often not connecting. We in the business world could learn something from the way these kids forge friendships, and the way the no-tech rules at camp can really help.Sportsmanship. In the workplace, we are in contact with with all kinds of people from around the world. And many companies today have four or five generations of people working side by side. This can lead to a diversity of perspectives, which is good for business, but also some tension and challenging workplace situations. At camp, Daniel is living in a small, stinky, un-air-conditioned bunk with 10 boys from around the globe. In their world, a swarm of black flies is no reason for a bad attitude. What’s our excuse?Fun.  We spend a lot of our lives at work. Why not make it fun? As much as possible, anyway. Not only is play great for people, but it’s also good for business. When we are happy, we release endorphins which lowers stress, and our creative juices flow. What better way to engage our employees and get more work done? Maybe we should take our workplace ping-pong a little more seriously? And make some friendship bracelets while we’re at it?!Near the end of visiting day, the Lermans got the whole camp together at the campfire. They reminded us about the importance of being nice and thanked us (parents) for sharing our boys with them. We sang the camp songs, tried to understand the inside jokes, but most of all, we felt the spirit. It’s always hard to say good-bye, but I knew Daniel was in good hands. And was learning something with far more impact than another skill or language. He was learning how to be human. He was bringing his human to camp."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59887b3c1400002000ecf7ec.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Family Research Council, in spite of all its claims of being a “Christian” organization, has no problem with spreading outright lies and distortions in its quest to stamp down on LGBTQ equality.However, in FRC’s quest to keep it’s sacred cow Donald Trump safe in the White House, the organization is obviously picking up his main bad habit; telling lies so pathetic that it takes no effort in refuting them.A recent Washington Update FRC put out defending Trump’s sad attempt to ban transgender men and women from the military is a perfect example. The amount of lies and misdirection the Family Research used in just two paragraphs of the post left me shocked. In over 10 years of tracking and calling out the group, I thought I had seen the full length of its audacity. Apparently I hadn’t:Liberals have spent the last week insisting that Donald Trump’s military policy is wrong ― but they certainly haven’t come up with any compelling reasons why. While conservatives point to a laundry list of problems from the potential $3.7 billion price tag to “sensitivity” training, the Left’s only defense seems to be trotting out photos of a former Navy SEAL Christopher (now Kristin) Beck. No one argues that Beck served his country with distinction ― but he never did so as a woman. He identified as a new gender after he was discharged, and even then, didn’t publicly “come out” until two years later. As Donna Carol Voss points out in a great column for the Federalist, “6 Ridiculous Arguments in Favor of Transgender Soldiers,”it’s “disingenuous to say Beck is the first female Navy SEAL when that career ended two years before Christopher ― who was known for his beard ― transitioned to Kristin. There has never been a female Navy SEAL, only a male Navy SEAL who retired and took feminizing hormones.” Ask a liberal how Obama’s policy actually improves readiness, and they’ll respond one of two ways: with a personal story or a personal attack. Why? Because there hasn’t been a single scientifically-based, rational military argument for it. Without psychology, top brass, or even popular opinion on their side, the Left resorts to a tired playbook ― distractions and name-calling. Fox News’s Tucker Carlson found that out in his debate with New York Congressman Sean Maloney (D). Like most liberals, Maloney’s go-to justifications for Obama’s were Beck and transgender empowerment. Apparently, he thinks the military’s job isn’t winning wars but putting people on the path to self-actualization.There are so many lies and misdirections here, I need to number them.1. “Liberals have spent the last week insisting that Donald Trump’s military policy is wrong ― but they certainly haven’t come up with any compelling reasons why. While conservatives point to a laundry list of problems...”That statement is a misdirection. The “laundry list” is a link FRC’s issue brief on the controversy. FRC conveniently omitted that both liberals and conservatives spoke out against the ban, including five Republican senators - Orrin Hatch, Joni Ernst, Lindsey Graham, Richard Shelby, and John McCain. Also, some conservatives said that ”they were pushing only to prevent the Pentagon from paying for medical costs associated with gender confirmation ― not an outright ban.” That brings us to point two.2. “the potential $3.7 billion price tag” It’s like I’ve said so many times before that when groups like FRC find a factoid they can use against the LGBTQ community, they will repeat it constantly regardless of said factoid being debunked. The idea that keeping transgender men and women in the military will cost over three billion dollars is not a possibility. It is a straight-up lie.According to CBS News:President Trump’s assertion that permitting transgender people in the armed services entails major health care costs appears to be overblown, based on estimates from the think tank RAND, which was asked by the Department of Defense to study the issue last year. Health care costs for treating active members who want to transition to another gender would increase by between $2.4 million to $8.4 million annually, RAND found. That translates to 0.04 percent to 0.13 percent of the agency’s annual spending on health care. “Our study found that the number of U.S. transgender service members who are likely to seek transition-related care is so small that a change in policy will likely have a marginal impact on health care costs and the readiness of the force,” the Rand researchers wrote.To come up with its figure, FRC used one of its fake experts, Peter Sprigg. Sprigg, a former “professional actor” and presently a pastor, has been anointed by FRC as “Senior Fellow of Policy Studies.” Who would you trust to give the best research? Him or an organization asked by the Department of Defense to provide research?3. “Because there hasn’t been a single scientifically-based, rational military argument for it. Without psychology, top brass, or even popular opinion on their side, the Left resorts to a tired playbook ― distractions and name-calling.”This a major lie on so many levels, the main one will be covered in point four. But more egregiously in this point are the links FRC provides to claim that top military brass and popular opinion are not on the side of those against the ban. Both links are to articles talking about delaying the implementation of Obama’s policy allowing transgender men and women to serve openly. Neither article have anything to do with Trump’s outright ban. What’s even more brazen of FRC to use those articles is the fact that both were published in June, a month before Trump tweeted his ban.In reality, top military brass and public opinion are in favor of transgender soldiers serving in the military.4. The entire tone of FRC’s article is that folks against the ban can’t find any good reason to oppose it, therefore we are attacking those who support the ban or using supposedly deceptive personal stories, such as the one the group spotlighted.That is the most blatant lie. Across the country, in column after column and editorial after editorial, reasons why Trump’s ban is bad policy are laid out.And there are also many diverse personal stories of those negatively affected by Trump’s ban.Perhaps there should be some focus on groups like the Family Research Council during this debate. Who deserves our support and respect more? Groups like the Family Research Council? Or the fighting transgender men and women whom they obviously view as expendable in this so-called culture war? What does it say about supposed “Christian” groups who will lie and distort to spit on those defending their freedoms?"

Authorities have offered a $2,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible. The fire started in the afternoon of July 16 near Lake McClure. The blaze forced thousands of evacuations as it rapidly spread in the following hours and days. Cal Fire Captain Koby Johns told the local ABC News affiliate on July 19 that the speed of the fire’s spread was “unprecedented” for the area. After weeks of battling the flames, the Detwiler fire is now 97 percent contained, Cal Fire said on Sunday. Firefighters continued working and urged residents to stay vigilant for changes in fire conditions.The inferno was one of more than a dozen wildfires that ignited in California in July.Experts say this summer’s wildfire risk has been aggravated by heavy rains last winter. While the recent wet winter offered California a reprieve after years of drought, experts say it also led to intense brush growth that, as it dried in the summer, proved the perfect fuel for fires."

Saturday’s runs marked the 30-year-old Jamaican sprinter’s apparent retirement from individual races, and a devastating retirement it is.American Justin Gatlin, who was twice banned from track and field after testing positive for drugs, finished first in the 100-meter race, crossing the finish line in 9.92 seconds and nabbing the gold. Christian Coleman, another American, took silver at 9.94 seconds.Bolt had a slow start and paid for it in the end, finishing in 9.95 seconds and settling for bronze. His 100-meter world record of 9.58 seconds, set in 2009, remains unbeaten.“My start is killing me,” Bolt told ESPN after the race. “Normally it gets better during the rounds, but it didn’t come together.”Gatlin reportedly had tears in his eyes after he won the race. He told the International Association of Athletics Federation that Bolt praised him after the win.“Usain said to me, ‘Congratulations, you deserve it,’” Gatlin said. “He knows how hard I work.”Bolt’s bronze medal on Saturday marks the first time the sprinting phenom has ever been beaten during a 100-meter at the world championships. During a 2011 race, he had a false start and was eliminated from competition.With nine Olympic gold medals and 11 world championship gold medals, Bolt has established himself as a world legend ― one of the fastest men in recorded history. Losing his chance to cement his career with one final gold in the 100-meter dash sours his iconic status only just a touch. Though Gatlin won the race, he still bowed down to Bolt after crossing the finish line.Bolt’s official retirement begins after he races for Jamaica during the 4 x 100-meter relay race in London next Saturday. Though he may have upset a few fans this weekend, he has not lost their respect."

22,POLITICS,A Trip To The Men's Room Turned Jeff Kessler Into The NCAA's Worst Nightmare,Travis Waldron,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jeffrey-kessler-ncaa-lawsuit_us_59723f33e4b00e4363df3f59,"Forty years after stumbling into sports law, the prominent antitrust attorney is fighting to reshape college sports -- and get players paid.",2017-08-06,"Jeffrey Kessler exits following a hearing for suspended Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson's hearing against the NFL over punishment for child abuse, in New York, on Dec. 2, 2014. Peterson was suspended by the NFL for using a tree branch to discipline his son. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5972405515000021008b2f96.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"Jeffrey Kessler just had to pee.It was the fall of 1975, and the Columbia law student was interviewing for an internship at Weil, Gotshal & Manges, a prominent New York firm known for its prowess in antitrust litigation, the area of law he’d decided was his future. As he walked into the men’s room after his interview, he noticed a group of extremely tall men shuffle in behind him. One of them stepped up to the urinal next to him. It was Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the 7-foot-tall Los Angeles Lakers superstar. Kessler was stunned, even a little confused. Antitrust law and the world of professional sports had begun to overlap in the decade prior, when St. Louis Cardinals outfielder Curt Flood sued Major League Baseball to overturn the league’s reserve clause, which bound players to their teams ― and restricted their salaries ― unless they were traded. But until the moment Abdul-Jabbar sidled up next to him at the urinal, Kessler hadn’t realized that his firm was at the center of another major sports case: a lawsuit brought by Milwaukee Bucks guard Oscar Robertson, the head of the NBA’s players union, that aimed to end the NBA’s version of the reserve clause, which limited free agency rights and gave teams near-complete control over their players.Kessler was a sports fan, and had long harbored an urge to work in public service. Growing up in the Sea Gate neighborhood in the outer reaches of Brooklyn, he was hardly a hippie, but he found it impossible to ignore the civil rights, feminist and anti-war movements erupting around him. An accomplished student, Kessler felt called to use his abilities to do some good in the world, and he saw the law ― and antitrust law, specifically ― as a way to do that. But at a time when the U.S. government had found a renewed zeal for using antitrust law to take on giant corporate monopolies, he’d never considered a future in sports law. Now he was surrounded by NBA players who’d come to Manhattan to take part in Robertson’s case.“I remember going home to my wife and saying, ‘You’re not going to believe who I saw in the men’s room today,’” Kessler said. Kessler never actually worked on that Robertson case. But soon after it settled, he joined the firm full-time, and over the next four decades, he would establish a reputation as one of the nation’s pre-eminent sports lawyers ― a bulldog attorney willing to take up the cause of virtually any athlete who felt he (or she) had been wronged by the league above them. He began representing NBA players in the 1970s and NFL players in the ’80s. He represented Freeman McNeil, the running back who sued the NFL in 1990, and won the 1992 decision that established free agency rights for professional football players. He’s worked on behalf of all four major men’s professional sports unions and the United States women’s national soccer team. He has counted Michael Jordan, Patrick Ewing, Tom Brady and Bill Belichick among his clients. All of that has led to perhaps the biggest case of his career: Jenkins v. the NCAA. The case, which Kessler filed on behalf of three college athletes in 2014, could upend major college sports as we know them.Although there have been other major lawsuits against the NCAA in recent years, none have targeted the entire system of college athletics quite like this one. Kessler and his plaintiffs aren’t seeking monetary damages. Instead, they want federal courts to rule that the existing model of major college sports ― specifically, men’s basketball and football ― violates federal antitrust law. If they win, they could reshape the current collegiate sports structure, forcing schools and major conferences to finally pay athletes in their two biggest sports. But the case, like many of his previous battles in sports, isn’t just about money: To Kessler, it’s fundamentally a fight for college athletes’ rights.“If we win,” Kessler told HuffPost, “it could make a big difference.”The nature of Kessler’s suit is a threat to the NCAA, but the real danger it poses stems directly from his involvement in it. The structure of professional sports gives athletes considerably less power than team owners and league executives. Over the last 40 years, though, Kessler has become athletes’ David to the leagues’ Goliath. Driven by a relentless belief that his clients are being wronged, he has used antitrust law to win ever-expanding rights for the players he represents. That instinct to do battle with the powerful was forged even before he stumbled into sports law. In 1976, Kessler and his fellow first-year law students at Columbia put on a musical. Kessler wrote a song to the tune of the Frank Sinatra number from the opening scene of “Guys and Dolls,” said his classmate Allan Van Fleet. The modified lyrics, Van Fleet recalled, took direct aim at IBM, the computing giant that was then at the center of one of the country’s largest-ever antitrust lawsuits.“The course is antitrust,For me it is a must,Watching IBM go bust …” Kessler sang.“For Jeff it was a must,” said Van Fleet, who also went into antitrust law. “Some of us fell into it later.”Kessler was “kind of a young idiot savant in the antitrust world” when he joined Weil, Gotshal & Manges full-time in 1977, said Jim Quinn, who worked on the Robertson case for the firm. Together, Quinn and Kessler built out the firm’s sports law and antitrust practice, taking up more NBA cases and a lawsuit filed by the North American Soccer League against the NFL. Eventually, they represented NFL and NHL players in labor disputes and court cases as well.Then, in 1990, Kessler and Quinn picked up their biggest case yet: a lawsuit filed by New York Jets running back Freeman McNeil, who alleged that the league’s restrictive free agency system artificially held down player salaries and violated federal antitrust laws.The NFL’s case rested on the testimony of University of Iowa economics professor George Daly, who told the jury that his studies showed that free agency would “spell economic ruin for the NFL,” according to a Sports Illustrated account of the trial. But on Sept. 7, 1992, in a courtroom in Minneapolis, Kessler launched into a devastating examination of Daly’s claims that destroyed the NFL’s case. Kessler repeatedly forced Daly to admit that he had not studied several aspects of the NFL’s economic system, including how much money owners diverted out of revenues and into their own salaries, or how free agency might impact NFL revenues and salaries. Kessler pointed to Daly’s projections that free agency would have harmful effects on Major League Baseball, even though it hadn’t then (it still hasn’t now). And he forced Daly to admit that he hadn’t even reviewed football’s financial statements or summaries.“You are not an expert on statistics or on football, are you?″ Kessler asked near the end of his time with the witness, according to UPI reports from the time.“No, I am not an expert on football,” Daly said.“Then why do you say changing the [free agency] system in football would hurt the competitive balance of the game?” Kessler asked.“I would defer to the football people on why they think that is important,” Daly said.It was a devastating encounter for the NFL. Four days later, the jury ruled that the league had violated antitrust laws, a decision that led to the creation of its modern free agency system. “He’s very difficult to outdo,” Quinn said of Kessler. “He’s quick on his feet, he comes up with very persuasive and sometimes novel theories and arguments, and they have a tendency to stick.”One reason Kessler has emerged as perhaps the most successful labor-side lawyer in sports is his belief in the righteousness of the cause athletes are fighting, said DeMaurice Smith, the executive director of the NFL Players Association, for which Kessler serves as outside counsel.“You can find a lot of lawyers who certainly possess the expertise to fight the cause,” Smith said. “But you either have the passion for the morality of the cause, or you don’t.”In 2008, Kessler helped Oscar Pistorius, the South African sprinter born without the bottom halves of his legs, win the right to compete against able-bodied athletes at the Olympics, a case he considers “a big win for disability rights.” Kessler is also currently representing members of the U.S. women’s national soccer team, who shortly after winning the 2015 World Cup filed a lawsuit against their governing body in an effort to win equal pay to their male counterparts. That case, Kessler says, “has a lot of meaning for the equal pay movement generally, way beyond sports, and even internationally.” (Indeed: U.S. senators and other equal pay advocates have continually highlighted the case as an example for the broader push for equal pay legislation.)Representing players in fights over money and, as he terms it, greater economic rights in their sports, is another front in that battle ― “my way of fulfilling my initial goals to do cases that I think are protecting a group of people who are often mistreated,” he says. The suit against the NCAA ― like those against the NFL and NBA before it ― is not a discrimination case. But it’s impossible to ignore its racial implications. A majority of the athletes in Division I men’s college basketball and football, Kessler notes, are African American, while the people who reap the financial rewards of the current system ― college administrators, athletic directors, television executives and coaches ― are primarily white men.“A lot of the athletes in both of those sports are African American,” he says. “That is the reality. And a lot of these players, both white and black, come from fairly impoverished backgrounds. So the fact that they’re exploited this way ... is a social justice issue.”At times, the passion that feeds Kessler’s often-acerbic tongue has earned the ire of his opponents at the bargaining table, and even those in the sports media. In 2011, during a bitter labor dispute between the NBA and its players union, Kessler and NBA Commissioner David Stern’s relationship boiled over after Kessler accused NBA owners of treating their players “like plantation workers.” Stern, who through an NBA spokesperson declined requests to comment for this article, told The Washington Post then that Kessler was “the single most divisive force” in the negotiating process, and that his conduct was “routinely despicable.”Anonymous sources from the players union even distanced themselves from the remarks, NBA legend Magic Johnson called them “ridiculous,” and the sports media went to town, publishing stories about how Kessler’s absence from negotiations improved the prospects of the two sides reaching a new labor deal. (Kessler, it should be noted, wasn’t alone: HBO commentator Bryant Gumbel also compared Stern to a plantation master during the 2011 NBA lockout.)Kessler began exploring ways to take on the NCAA late in 2013, when his firm, Winston & Strawn, created a division solely focused on legal issues within college sports. “There are good (legal) arguments that Division I football is basically a business, and that students are exploited as workers,” he told me in an interview that year. “And therefore schools should be free to compensate athletes in any manner that they want to, without NCAA restrictions.”At a press conference ahead of Super Bowl XLVIII in February 2014, Kessler met Ramogi Huma, a former linebacker at UCLA who by then had become one of the country’s biggest advocates for expanding the rights of college athletes. Huma was helping football players at Northwestern University in their attempt to form the first players union for college athletes, but he was also dreaming bigger. He wanted to strike at the heart of the NCAA’s amateurism model, to destroy the pillar of the system the NCAA has used to defend itself in court.After chatting at the press conference, the pair agreed to meet for lunch near Kessler’s office later in the week. Huma was immediately sold. “I’ve talked to a lot of lawyers who wanted to bring cases,” Huma says of Kessler now, “and none of them talked like that.”Together, Huma and Kessler worked to find a college athlete who could serve as a plaintiff on the suit. Huma had one in mind. He called Martin Jenkins, a defensive back at Clemson University. Jenkins had sensed something wrong with the collegiate model when, not long after he arrived at Clemson, the Tigers’ compliance staff rattled off the long list of rules about what athletes are and aren’t allowed to do if they want to maintain their eligibility to play. “Red flags started going off in my mind,” Jenkins told HuffPost. “This wasn’t fair to the players, it wasn’t fair to the people on the field who were doing the work.” Huma asked Jenkins if he’d meet with Kessler, and Jenkins agreed.“He seemed more excited and energized than I was, and I was really excited to be involved in it,” Jenkins said. In March 2014, a month after Kessler and Huma’s meeting in New York, Kessler sued the NCAA.It has now been more than three years since Kessler sued the NCAA on Jenkins’ behalf. In the interim, the case has picked up two other named plaintiffs ― former Middle Tennessee State football player Anfornee Stewart and ex-Wisconsin basketball player Nigel Hayes, who became an outspoken advocate for the rights of college athletes during a career that included two appearances in the Final Four.The big business of college sports, meanwhile, has only continued to explode. Today, the men’s NCAA Tournament alone provides the organization with nearly $900 million annually in television revenue, while individual conferences have television contracts worth billions of dollars over their lifespans, and schools pay coaches and athletic directors multimillion-dollar salaries. Collectively, the men’s basketball programs that make up Division I and the football programs in the Football Bowl Subdivision generate more than $7 billion in annual revenues. Big-time college sports look more like their professional counterparts than they ever have, with one major exception: The NCAA has restrictive rules in place that prevent schools from compensating athletes beyond the full cost of attending.“The economics here are that basketball and football have become gigantic businesses,” Kessler said. “The total revenue for basketball and football in Division I is greater than the total revenue of the NBA. It’s greater than the total revenue of the NHL. … It’s the third biggest sport by revenue in this country. The idea that these are not businesses, it makes no sense. And you should allow those who are producing this revenue to be treated in a fairer way.”But even though Kessler believes college athletes should be better-compensated, he and his clients aren’t seeking financial damages. The point of the case isn’t to remedy past wrongs, but to completely alter the relationship between players and the system and prevent those wrongs from continuing. That’s what makes the Kessler case different from other antitrust cases filed against the NCAA, including that of former UCLA basketball star Ed O’Bannon, who won a partial victory for college athletes that allowed them to receive cost-of-attendance stipends beyond the value of a scholarship. During the O’Bannon suit, NCAA president Mark Emmert suggested that even the largest athletic programs would “move toward a Division III model” of college athletics if they had to pay their athletes (D-III schools don’t offer athletic scholarships). Conference and university administrators have suggested that they can’t afford to pay athletes, or that doing so would violate the spirit of amateurism in college sports.Kessler has read the headlines and heard these arguments. He knows some believe that his case could “suck the magic out of college sports” and turn them into glorified minor leagues that fans simply wouldn’t watch. But even if he wins, he argues, the outcome won’t be nearly as dire or drastic as the skeptics predict. Kessler’s primary argument is not against the NCAA itself, but its amateurism rules specifically. What violates antitrust law, he argues, is that the schools and major conferences band together under those rules to artificially cap the compensation an athlete can receive for his services to a school. In Kessler’s world, conferences could set their own rules regarding compensation, then compete against each other: The Big Ten might stick to the current rules, for instance, while the Southeastern Conference might elect to pay athletes above and beyond the value of a scholarship. Another might follow the Ivy League model and refuse to grant athletic scholarships at all. The result would be something of a free market for men’s basketball and football players.Alternatively, the NCAA, its schools and their conferences could follow in the path of major pro leagues, and negotiate a new system with athletes or a body that represents them. “I know what they’re going to argue in court,” Kessler said, sitting up in his chair and clapping his hands together, his voice nearly cracking from excitement ― and frustration. “They’ll argue what they’ve always argued: that amateurism is this holy grail. The new version of it is that if you pay one penny more than the full cost of attendance ... the world will come to an end.” There are obvious parallels to his previous cases, where the NBA, Major League Baseball and the NFL all contended that more rights, and more money, for players would spell doom for their products. Free agency, of course, has had none of the dramatic and devastating effects the owners once predicted: Salaries have risen tremendously, sure, but so have revenues. Leagues, owners and players are all vastly richer today than they once were. “It’s utter and complete nonsense,” Kessler said. “Allowing baseball, football, basketball and hockey players greater economic freedom and compensation did not destroy the NFL or NBA. It did not destroy the NHL or Major League Baseball. It made those sports fairer and better. It did not decrease popularity or interest in the Olympics.”“It’ll be interesting to see how it plays out,” Quinn, Kessler’s former partner, said. “I think the NCAA has some problems on its hands.”Last fall, U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken ― who also oversaw the O’Bannon suit, and ruled that the NCAA was in partial violation of antitrust law ― rejected the NCAA’s motion to dismiss the Jenkins case. The two sides have conducted expert depositions and discovery over the last six months, a process that will conclude this month. They’ll return to court for hearings in August, and the case likely will head to trial sometime in 2018. It seems almost impossible that the two sides will reach a settlement before then, given the NCAA’s steadfast refusal to bend unless forced.It is likely to take years for the case to reach a final resolution. Kessler is prepared to fight it all the way to the Supreme Court if he has to. But Kessler is confident, and his excitement that a potential trial is drawing nearer is obvious as soon as he begins talking about it. Among those on his side, there’s a sense of optimism that Kessler is leading the fight.“There’s no question that this is the best possible case that could be brought,” Huma said. “And a big part of that is because Jeff Kessler is heading it up.”CORRECTION: A previous version of this article misstated the year that Kessler encountered Abdul-Jabbar in the men’s room; it was 1975, not 1976."
23,POLITICS,A Trip To The Men's Room Turned Jeff Kessler Into The NCAA's Worst Nightmare,Travis Waldron,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jeffrey-kessler-ncaa-lawsuit_us_59723f33e4b00e4363df3f59,"Forty years after stumbling into sports law, the prominent antitrust attorney is fighting to reshape college sports -- and get players paid.",2017-08-06,"In 1990, Kessler represented New York Jets running back Freeman McNeil, seen above, in a lawsuit alleging the NFL's free agency system violated federal antitrust laws.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5972415a15000021008b2f9a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"Jeffrey Kessler just had to pee.It was the fall of 1975, and the Columbia law student was interviewing for an internship at Weil, Gotshal & Manges, a prominent New York firm known for its prowess in antitrust litigation, the area of law he’d decided was his future. As he walked into the men’s room after his interview, he noticed a group of extremely tall men shuffle in behind him. One of them stepped up to the urinal next to him. It was Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the 7-foot-tall Los Angeles Lakers superstar. Kessler was stunned, even a little confused. Antitrust law and the world of professional sports had begun to overlap in the decade prior, when St. Louis Cardinals outfielder Curt Flood sued Major League Baseball to overturn the league’s reserve clause, which bound players to their teams ― and restricted their salaries ― unless they were traded. But until the moment Abdul-Jabbar sidled up next to him at the urinal, Kessler hadn’t realized that his firm was at the center of another major sports case: a lawsuit brought by Milwaukee Bucks guard Oscar Robertson, the head of the NBA’s players union, that aimed to end the NBA’s version of the reserve clause, which limited free agency rights and gave teams near-complete control over their players.Kessler was a sports fan, and had long harbored an urge to work in public service. Growing up in the Sea Gate neighborhood in the outer reaches of Brooklyn, he was hardly a hippie, but he found it impossible to ignore the civil rights, feminist and anti-war movements erupting around him. An accomplished student, Kessler felt called to use his abilities to do some good in the world, and he saw the law ― and antitrust law, specifically ― as a way to do that. But at a time when the U.S. government had found a renewed zeal for using antitrust law to take on giant corporate monopolies, he’d never considered a future in sports law. Now he was surrounded by NBA players who’d come to Manhattan to take part in Robertson’s case.“I remember going home to my wife and saying, ‘You’re not going to believe who I saw in the men’s room today,’” Kessler said. Kessler never actually worked on that Robertson case. But soon after it settled, he joined the firm full-time, and over the next four decades, he would establish a reputation as one of the nation’s pre-eminent sports lawyers ― a bulldog attorney willing to take up the cause of virtually any athlete who felt he (or she) had been wronged by the league above them. He began representing NBA players in the 1970s and NFL players in the ’80s. He represented Freeman McNeil, the running back who sued the NFL in 1990, and won the 1992 decision that established free agency rights for professional football players. He’s worked on behalf of all four major men’s professional sports unions and the United States women’s national soccer team. He has counted Michael Jordan, Patrick Ewing, Tom Brady and Bill Belichick among his clients. All of that has led to perhaps the biggest case of his career: Jenkins v. the NCAA. The case, which Kessler filed on behalf of three college athletes in 2014, could upend major college sports as we know them.Although there have been other major lawsuits against the NCAA in recent years, none have targeted the entire system of college athletics quite like this one. Kessler and his plaintiffs aren’t seeking monetary damages. Instead, they want federal courts to rule that the existing model of major college sports ― specifically, men’s basketball and football ― violates federal antitrust law. If they win, they could reshape the current collegiate sports structure, forcing schools and major conferences to finally pay athletes in their two biggest sports. But the case, like many of his previous battles in sports, isn’t just about money: To Kessler, it’s fundamentally a fight for college athletes’ rights.“If we win,” Kessler told HuffPost, “it could make a big difference.”The nature of Kessler’s suit is a threat to the NCAA, but the real danger it poses stems directly from his involvement in it. The structure of professional sports gives athletes considerably less power than team owners and league executives. Over the last 40 years, though, Kessler has become athletes’ David to the leagues’ Goliath. Driven by a relentless belief that his clients are being wronged, he has used antitrust law to win ever-expanding rights for the players he represents. That instinct to do battle with the powerful was forged even before he stumbled into sports law. In 1976, Kessler and his fellow first-year law students at Columbia put on a musical. Kessler wrote a song to the tune of the Frank Sinatra number from the opening scene of “Guys and Dolls,” said his classmate Allan Van Fleet. The modified lyrics, Van Fleet recalled, took direct aim at IBM, the computing giant that was then at the center of one of the country’s largest-ever antitrust lawsuits.“The course is antitrust,For me it is a must,Watching IBM go bust …” Kessler sang.“For Jeff it was a must,” said Van Fleet, who also went into antitrust law. “Some of us fell into it later.”Kessler was “kind of a young idiot savant in the antitrust world” when he joined Weil, Gotshal & Manges full-time in 1977, said Jim Quinn, who worked on the Robertson case for the firm. Together, Quinn and Kessler built out the firm’s sports law and antitrust practice, taking up more NBA cases and a lawsuit filed by the North American Soccer League against the NFL. Eventually, they represented NFL and NHL players in labor disputes and court cases as well.Then, in 1990, Kessler and Quinn picked up their biggest case yet: a lawsuit filed by New York Jets running back Freeman McNeil, who alleged that the league’s restrictive free agency system artificially held down player salaries and violated federal antitrust laws.The NFL’s case rested on the testimony of University of Iowa economics professor George Daly, who told the jury that his studies showed that free agency would “spell economic ruin for the NFL,” according to a Sports Illustrated account of the trial. But on Sept. 7, 1992, in a courtroom in Minneapolis, Kessler launched into a devastating examination of Daly’s claims that destroyed the NFL’s case. Kessler repeatedly forced Daly to admit that he had not studied several aspects of the NFL’s economic system, including how much money owners diverted out of revenues and into their own salaries, or how free agency might impact NFL revenues and salaries. Kessler pointed to Daly’s projections that free agency would have harmful effects on Major League Baseball, even though it hadn’t then (it still hasn’t now). And he forced Daly to admit that he hadn’t even reviewed football’s financial statements or summaries.“You are not an expert on statistics or on football, are you?″ Kessler asked near the end of his time with the witness, according to UPI reports from the time.“No, I am not an expert on football,” Daly said.“Then why do you say changing the [free agency] system in football would hurt the competitive balance of the game?” Kessler asked.“I would defer to the football people on why they think that is important,” Daly said.It was a devastating encounter for the NFL. Four days later, the jury ruled that the league had violated antitrust laws, a decision that led to the creation of its modern free agency system. “He’s very difficult to outdo,” Quinn said of Kessler. “He’s quick on his feet, he comes up with very persuasive and sometimes novel theories and arguments, and they have a tendency to stick.”One reason Kessler has emerged as perhaps the most successful labor-side lawyer in sports is his belief in the righteousness of the cause athletes are fighting, said DeMaurice Smith, the executive director of the NFL Players Association, for which Kessler serves as outside counsel.“You can find a lot of lawyers who certainly possess the expertise to fight the cause,” Smith said. “But you either have the passion for the morality of the cause, or you don’t.”In 2008, Kessler helped Oscar Pistorius, the South African sprinter born without the bottom halves of his legs, win the right to compete against able-bodied athletes at the Olympics, a case he considers “a big win for disability rights.” Kessler is also currently representing members of the U.S. women’s national soccer team, who shortly after winning the 2015 World Cup filed a lawsuit against their governing body in an effort to win equal pay to their male counterparts. That case, Kessler says, “has a lot of meaning for the equal pay movement generally, way beyond sports, and even internationally.” (Indeed: U.S. senators and other equal pay advocates have continually highlighted the case as an example for the broader push for equal pay legislation.)Representing players in fights over money and, as he terms it, greater economic rights in their sports, is another front in that battle ― “my way of fulfilling my initial goals to do cases that I think are protecting a group of people who are often mistreated,” he says. The suit against the NCAA ― like those against the NFL and NBA before it ― is not a discrimination case. But it’s impossible to ignore its racial implications. A majority of the athletes in Division I men’s college basketball and football, Kessler notes, are African American, while the people who reap the financial rewards of the current system ― college administrators, athletic directors, television executives and coaches ― are primarily white men.“A lot of the athletes in both of those sports are African American,” he says. “That is the reality. And a lot of these players, both white and black, come from fairly impoverished backgrounds. So the fact that they’re exploited this way ... is a social justice issue.”At times, the passion that feeds Kessler’s often-acerbic tongue has earned the ire of his opponents at the bargaining table, and even those in the sports media. In 2011, during a bitter labor dispute between the NBA and its players union, Kessler and NBA Commissioner David Stern’s relationship boiled over after Kessler accused NBA owners of treating their players “like plantation workers.” Stern, who through an NBA spokesperson declined requests to comment for this article, told The Washington Post then that Kessler was “the single most divisive force” in the negotiating process, and that his conduct was “routinely despicable.”Anonymous sources from the players union even distanced themselves from the remarks, NBA legend Magic Johnson called them “ridiculous,” and the sports media went to town, publishing stories about how Kessler’s absence from negotiations improved the prospects of the two sides reaching a new labor deal. (Kessler, it should be noted, wasn’t alone: HBO commentator Bryant Gumbel also compared Stern to a plantation master during the 2011 NBA lockout.)Kessler began exploring ways to take on the NCAA late in 2013, when his firm, Winston & Strawn, created a division solely focused on legal issues within college sports. “There are good (legal) arguments that Division I football is basically a business, and that students are exploited as workers,” he told me in an interview that year. “And therefore schools should be free to compensate athletes in any manner that they want to, without NCAA restrictions.”At a press conference ahead of Super Bowl XLVIII in February 2014, Kessler met Ramogi Huma, a former linebacker at UCLA who by then had become one of the country’s biggest advocates for expanding the rights of college athletes. Huma was helping football players at Northwestern University in their attempt to form the first players union for college athletes, but he was also dreaming bigger. He wanted to strike at the heart of the NCAA’s amateurism model, to destroy the pillar of the system the NCAA has used to defend itself in court.After chatting at the press conference, the pair agreed to meet for lunch near Kessler’s office later in the week. Huma was immediately sold. “I’ve talked to a lot of lawyers who wanted to bring cases,” Huma says of Kessler now, “and none of them talked like that.”Together, Huma and Kessler worked to find a college athlete who could serve as a plaintiff on the suit. Huma had one in mind. He called Martin Jenkins, a defensive back at Clemson University. Jenkins had sensed something wrong with the collegiate model when, not long after he arrived at Clemson, the Tigers’ compliance staff rattled off the long list of rules about what athletes are and aren’t allowed to do if they want to maintain their eligibility to play. “Red flags started going off in my mind,” Jenkins told HuffPost. “This wasn’t fair to the players, it wasn’t fair to the people on the field who were doing the work.” Huma asked Jenkins if he’d meet with Kessler, and Jenkins agreed.“He seemed more excited and energized than I was, and I was really excited to be involved in it,” Jenkins said. In March 2014, a month after Kessler and Huma’s meeting in New York, Kessler sued the NCAA.It has now been more than three years since Kessler sued the NCAA on Jenkins’ behalf. In the interim, the case has picked up two other named plaintiffs ― former Middle Tennessee State football player Anfornee Stewart and ex-Wisconsin basketball player Nigel Hayes, who became an outspoken advocate for the rights of college athletes during a career that included two appearances in the Final Four.The big business of college sports, meanwhile, has only continued to explode. Today, the men’s NCAA Tournament alone provides the organization with nearly $900 million annually in television revenue, while individual conferences have television contracts worth billions of dollars over their lifespans, and schools pay coaches and athletic directors multimillion-dollar salaries. Collectively, the men’s basketball programs that make up Division I and the football programs in the Football Bowl Subdivision generate more than $7 billion in annual revenues. Big-time college sports look more like their professional counterparts than they ever have, with one major exception: The NCAA has restrictive rules in place that prevent schools from compensating athletes beyond the full cost of attending.“The economics here are that basketball and football have become gigantic businesses,” Kessler said. “The total revenue for basketball and football in Division I is greater than the total revenue of the NBA. It’s greater than the total revenue of the NHL. … It’s the third biggest sport by revenue in this country. The idea that these are not businesses, it makes no sense. And you should allow those who are producing this revenue to be treated in a fairer way.”But even though Kessler believes college athletes should be better-compensated, he and his clients aren’t seeking financial damages. The point of the case isn’t to remedy past wrongs, but to completely alter the relationship between players and the system and prevent those wrongs from continuing. That’s what makes the Kessler case different from other antitrust cases filed against the NCAA, including that of former UCLA basketball star Ed O’Bannon, who won a partial victory for college athletes that allowed them to receive cost-of-attendance stipends beyond the value of a scholarship.

Conference and university administrators have suggested that they can’t afford to pay athletes, or that doing so would violate the spirit of amateurism in college sports.Kessler has read the headlines and heard these arguments.

The new version of it is that if you pay one penny more than the full cost of attendance ... the world will come to an end.” There are obvious parallels to his previous cases, where the NBA, Major League Baseball and the NFL all contended that more rights, and more money, for players would spell doom for their products.

They’re the “the Oscars for minor league baseball,” honoring the best promotional ideas by teams, Billy Harner, the director of communications for the Brooklyn Cyclones, told HuffPost.Harner and the Cyclones won the award in 2014 when he came up with the notion of having the team host a “Seinfeld”-themed night to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the show’s start on NBC.“While I’m up there talking about it [while accepting the award], then you just hear the roars of laughter,” said Harner. “I kind of had a really good idea that it was gonna be something that would sort of catch on.”It became an annual event for the Cyclones. And now minor leagues teams all across the country host their own “Seinfeld” nights. Harner knew of multiple teams in the New York area alone doing it the same weekend as the Cyclones promotion this year, which occurred on Saturday at the team’s Coney Island home.“They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery,” said Harner. “We enjoy it.”The Cyclones version of the night has traditionally had various “Seinfeld”-themed competitions throughout the night, most notably people trying to dance as terribly as the character Elaine Benes.“Now it’s sort of a ‘Seinfeld’ convention with a baseball game going on in the background,” Harner said.For Saturday’s event on Aug. 5, a competition Harner was particularly excited about was a nod to the character George Costanza streaking through Yankee stadium in a flesh-colored bodysuit. At the Cyclones game, two people wore bodysuits head-to-toe and ran around the outfield warning track. Not being able to see very well, the winner accidentally ran into a Cyclones’ social media person ― which was partially captured on video.From the stands, the social media person could be seen flying backwards about 10 feet. She was later overheard saying she was alright.“You sit and you look at this stuff and you’re like, ‘This is ridiculous,’” said Harner. “But it’s what people come back for.”The actor who played lawyer Jackie Chiles on the show, Phil Morris, was also present to sign autographs and lead the 7th-inning-stretch. Specialty pins with his character’s face on it and the word “Cyclones” were available. Harner lamented that despite the fan interest, the “Seinfeld” show, which aired from 1989 to 1998, means basically nothing to most of the Brooklyn Cyclones players and much of the team’s staff. “One of the things that absolutely breaks my heart is that the majority of the people that work for us and the majority of the people that play for the team are all so young,” said Harner. “I had to give everybody like a primer of, ‘This is the show. Watch some DVDs on your road trip, so you can at least sound sort of knowledgeable.’ And you find one or two guys that watch it, they know the re-runs, so it works out okay.”Harner remains proud of being able to create this send-up to one of his favorite shows.“This is the most ridiculous thing we’ve ever done,” he said. “And it’s amazing that so many people are embracing it ― sort of the way that in my head, how I wanted it to play out.” "
25,POLITICS,The Ironworker Challenging Paul Ryan Sees Path To Victory Through Working People,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/randy-bryce-paul-ryan-working-people_us_59863b7ce4b08b75dcc76677,"Randy Bryce tells the House speaker: ""Let's trade places.""",2017-08-06,"Randy Bryce at a panel on the importance of the Latino vote during Politicon on July 30 in Pasadena, California.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59863dda2200002d001a49ff.jpeg?cache=9sC5v7l5CG&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Ironworker Randy Bryce recently got to talking politics with a man he met at his job site.They were working together on building a two-story parking lot for a Veterans Affairs hospital in Milwaukee, and it sounded like the guy had voted for President Donald Trump in the 2016 election.Bryce, then-politics coordinator for his union, Iron Workers Local 8, is a committed progressive Democrat. And the man with whom he was conversing surprised him.Rather than express enthusiasm for Trump, the fellow threw up his hands in frustration, wondering why there weren’t more ordinary workers in politics.“He was like, ‘You know what? I’m sick of voting for all these people. Why don’t we have one of us? You know, one of us should run,’” Bryce told HuffPost at a Washington fundraiser in July, a Wisconsin accent audible in his vowels.Bryce, a 52-year-old Army veteran, had good news. “I just started laughing. I said, ‘Where do you live?’” When he heard the answer, he said, “I’ll have one of my signs up in your front yard.”It was May then. A month later, Bryce announced his 2018 candidacy for Wisconsin’s 1st Congressional District ― a seat in the state’s southeastern corner that House Speaker Paul Ryan, 47, first won in 1998.Although it is a long shot, Bryce’s bid has already attracted national attention. His campaign is an opportunity for Democrats to both regain working-class trust in the Rust Belt and land an unlikely knockout blow against the country’s second-most powerful Republican.Bryce kicked off his campaign on June 18 with a two-and-a-half minute online video that instantly went viral. It opens with clips of Trump and Ryan discussing efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act ― Obamacare ― before introducing the older woman with multiple sclerosis who is Bryce’s mother. Bryce shares how his mom’s pain and his experience as an ironworker inspired him to fight for affordable health care and workers’ rights.“If somebody falls behind, we’re that much stronger if we carry them with us,” Bryce says in a voiceover as images of him on the job and with his mother and 10-year-old son appear on screen. “That’s the way I was raised ― we look out for each other.”He also directly challenges the man he hopes to topple, saying: “Let’s trade places. Paul Ryan, you can come work the iron, and I’ll go to D.C.”Following the splashy debut, Bryce’s campaign exploded. Within 24 hours he had raised $100,000. He now has over $750,000 from more than 22,000 individual donors.Bryce quickly picked up the endorsements of leading national progressive organizations, including the Congressional Progressive Caucus, the Working Families Party, Democracy for America, VoteVets, NARAL Pro-Choice America and the Transport Workers Union.He also enjoys the backing of liberal Hollywood celebrities like Patton Oswalt and Nick Offerman. Both of them touted Bryce on Twitter, where the mustachioed ironworker ― @IronStache ― has become a progressive celebrity of his own. He began the campaign with some 6,000 followers, but now has over 133,000 ― a sizable audience to whom he regularly dispenses his homespun jabs at Trump and Ryan.It is not hard to see why Democrats are excited about Bryce. After all, Ryan’s crusade to dramatically reducing the social safety net has earned him the ire of liberals. That the Beltway chattering class has dubbed him the GOP’s most reasonable “policy wonk” only heightens the contempt for Ryan among rank-and-file Democrats.Bryce, by contrast, is a staunch backer of a single-payer health care system, in which the government provides insurance to everybody. Progressive activists have accelerated a push to get Democrats to run on single payer, or “Medicare for all,” in the wake of the collapse of Republican Obamacare repeal efforts.“It’s actually going to cost less money in taxes” than the current system costs through other forms of payment, Bryce said. “It’s gonna be helpful for employers [in creating jobs] if they don’t have to worry about providing health care.(Medicare, a form of single-payer insurance for seniors and people with disabilities, indeed has a lower rate of cost growth than private insurers.)What’s more, Bryce is an almost too on-the-nose personification of the populist, union hard-hat worker who once made Wisconsin and other industrial Great Lakes’ states Democratic strongholds. A burly man of 6-feet-2-inches, he was sporting a blue button-down shirt with the sleeves rolled up to the middle of his forearms at the recent fundraiser in Washington. He was one of the few men in the room not wearing a jacket.Born in Milwaukee, Bryce lives in Caledonia, a suburb south of the city. Divorced, he shares custody of his son with his ex-wife. He enjoys taking the boy fishing on weekends.For Democrats scrambling to win back at least some of the predominantly white, blue-collar workers who fled the party for Trump, “IronStache” Bryce is not a bad guy to have on your side.A lot of Bryce’s peers “weren’t inspired” by Democrat Hillary Clinton’s message in the 2016 presidential race, he said. “They saw her as part of an establishment. Then they look at Donald Trump and he had a decent, working person’s message.”“So when I see ’em now, I say, ‘Can you tell me one promise that he’s kept you, one thing he’s promised during his campaign that he’s kept and that’s the reason you’re voting for him?’” he said. “And they’ll tell me, ‘Honestly, I can’t.’ It’s a buyer’s remorse. People are waking up.”At the same time, Bryce is not just progressive on economic issues. He supports the movement for black lives, abortion rights and universal gun background checks. Those stances allow him to circumvent the sticky intra-party debates over how much ideological deviance progressives should tolerate from red- and purple-state candidates on so-called cultural issues.In fact, Bryce’s greatest strength may be his ability to articulate the progressive position on issues like immigration reform in a way that does not alienate skeptical working-class voters.When speaking to friends who are angry about what they perceive as the unfairness of illegal immigration, Bryce appeals to their class solidarity.“If there weren’t employers that would readily take advantage of workers that don’t have documentation in this country, there wouldn’t be jobs to come to,” Bryce said.He supports comprehensive immigration reform that provides a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. “In the big picture, it’s about the whole thing being unbalanced in employers’ favor,” he said.In some ways, Bryce’s candidacy is a bet that union-fueled populism remains alive and well in Wisconsin, despite the devastating losses that both the labor movement and the closely related Democratic Party have endured there in recent years.Bryce is just as eager to tie Ryan to two-term Republican Gov. Scott Walker as he is to Trump. Walker famously stripped Wisconsin’s public-sector workers of their collective bargaining rights in 2011 following weeks of protests in the state capitol of Madison.After withstanding a contentious 2012 recall effort and prevailing in his 2014 re-election bid, Walker turned his attention to neutering private-sector unions. In 2015, he made Wisconsin a right-to-work state, depriving all unions of the ability to require workers under contracts they negotiate to pay dues to the labor groups.Some Wisconsinites believe the massive decline in union strength and membership in the state contributed to Clinton’s loss there last November.Anti-Walker fervor has become a part of Bryce’s identity. His cellphone ringtone is “Worker’s Song” by the Dropkick Murphys. The Massachusetts-based Celtic punk band’s dedication of the song “Take ’Em Down” to public-sector unions fighting Walker in 2011, and subsequent refusal to let a GOP congressional candidate use its music at his rallies, won Bryce’s heart.“Aside from Bruce Springsteen, they are my favorite band ever since,” he said.In the past, Ryan has backed the Davis-Bacon Act, requiring federal construction projects to honor the “prevailing” union wages in an area. It’s a provision critical for construction unions like the one to which Bryce belongs.A spokesman for Ryan’s re-election campaign did not respond to a request to confirm the speaker’s position on Davis-Bacon or to address a host of criticisms leveled against him by Bryce.For his part, Bryce stresses Ryan’s ties to Walker, the country’s most famous union-buster. Ryan called the peaceful 2011 protests against Walker “riots,” and compared it to the sometimes violent Arab Spring demonstrations in Egypt. (Politifact rated Ryan’s characterization “pants on fire.”)Ryan is “right in line with the Scott Walker-extreme Republicans. They’re, you know, buddy-buddy,” Bryce said.By any measure, the ironworker faces an uphill battle. Ryan, a deeply rooted native of Janesville (his great-grandfather started a construction business that’s still in the family), was re-elected in the district by 35 percentage points in 2016. Trump, meanwhile, won the district by 10 percentage points. Ryan currently has $11.1 million in campaign cash on hand, and as speaker, he can undoubtedly raise much more.The district, which includes Kenosha and Racine, is not firmly in the Republican column, however. A majority of voters in the district opted for then-presidential candidate Barack Obama in 2008. Bryce maintains that Ryan simply has not faced a formidable enough opponent yet.Of course, Bryce has yet to achieve success in electoral politics. He has lost three bids for lower office, including, most recently, a 2014 run for state senate.But Bryce has never had a foil quite like Ryan. He plans to use Ryan’s role in the Obamacare repeal debacle as evidence of both the speaker’s cruelty and his incompetence.“He would like you to think he’s this fantastic policy wonk,” Bryce said. “He’s speaker of the House. He’s got a Republican president, a Republican Senate, a conservative Supreme Court ― and what has he done? He’s done nothing.”"

And the man with whom he was conversing surprised him.Rather than express enthusiasm for Trump, the fellow threw up his hands in frustration, wondering why there weren’t more ordinary workers in politics.“He was like, ‘You know what? I’m sick of voting for all these people. Why don’t we have one of us? You know, one of us should run,’” Bryce told HuffPost at a Washington fundraiser in July, a Wisconsin accent audible in his vowels.Bryce, a 52-year-old Army veteran, had good news. “I just started laughing. I said, ‘Where do you live?’” When he heard the answer, he said, “I’ll have one of my signs up in your front yard.”It was May then. A month later, Bryce announced his 2018 candidacy for Wisconsin’s 1st Congressional District ― a seat in the state’s southeastern corner that House Speaker Paul Ryan, 47, first won in 1998.Although it is a long shot, Bryce’s bid has already attracted national attention. His campaign is an opportunity for Democrats to both regain working-class trust in the Rust Belt and land an unlikely knockout blow against the country’s second-most powerful Republican.Bryce kicked off his campaign on June 18 with a two-and-a-half minute online video that instantly went viral. It opens with clips of Trump and Ryan discussing efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act ― Obamacare ― before introducing the older woman with multiple sclerosis who is Bryce’s mother. Bryce shares how his mom’s pain and his experience as an ironworker inspired him to fight for affordable health care and workers’ rights.“If somebody falls behind, we’re that much stronger if we carry them with us,” Bryce says in a voiceover as images of him on the job and with his mother and 10-year-old son appear on screen. “That’s the way I was raised ― we look out for each other.”He also directly challenges the man he hopes to topple, saying: “Let’s trade places. Paul Ryan, you can come work the iron, and I’ll go to D.C.”Following the splashy debut, Bryce’s campaign exploded. Within 24 hours he had raised $100,000. He now has over $750,000 from more than 22,000 individual donors.Bryce quickly picked up the endorsements of leading national progressive organizations, including the Congressional Progressive Caucus, the Working Families Party, Democracy for America, VoteVets, NARAL Pro-Choice America and the Transport Workers Union.He also enjoys the backing of liberal Hollywood celebrities like Patton Oswalt and Nick Offerman. Both of them touted Bryce on Twitter, where the mustachioed ironworker ― @IronStache ― has become a progressive celebrity of his own. He began the campaign with some 6,000 followers, but now has over 133,000 ― a sizable audience to whom he regularly dispenses his homespun jabs at Trump and Ryan.It is not hard to see why Democrats are excited about Bryce. After all, Ryan’s crusade to dramatically reducing the social safety net has earned him the ire of liberals. That the Beltway chattering class has dubbed him the GOP’s most reasonable “policy wonk” only heightens the contempt for Ryan among rank-and-file Democrats.Bryce, by contrast, is a staunch backer of a single-payer health care system, in which the government provides insurance to everybody. Progressive activists have accelerated a push to get Democrats to run on single payer, or “Medicare for all,” in the wake of the collapse of Republican Obamacare repeal efforts.“It’s actually going to cost less money in taxes” than the current system costs through other forms of payment, Bryce said. “It’s gonna be helpful for employers [in creating jobs] if they don’t have to worry about providing health care.(Medicare, a form of single-payer insurance for seniors and people with disabilities, indeed has a lower rate of cost growth than private insurers.)What’s more, Bryce is an almost too on-the-nose personification of the populist, union hard-hat worker who once made Wisconsin and other industrial Great Lakes’ states Democratic strongholds. A burly man of 6-feet-2-inches, he was sporting a blue button-down shirt with the sleeves rolled up to the middle of his forearms at the recent fundraiser in Washington. He was one of the few men in the room not wearing a jacket.Born in Milwaukee, Bryce lives in Caledonia, a suburb south of the city. Divorced, he shares custody of his son with his ex-wife. He enjoys taking the boy fishing on weekends.For Democrats scrambling to win back at least some of the predominantly white, blue-collar workers who fled the party for Trump, “IronStache” Bryce is not a bad guy to have on your side.A lot of Bryce’s peers “weren’t inspired” by Democrat Hillary Clinton’s message in the 2016 presidential race, he said. “They saw her as part of an establishment. Then they look at Donald Trump and he had a decent, working person’s message.”“So when I see ’em now, I say, ‘Can you tell me one promise that he’s kept you, one thing he’s promised during his campaign that he’s kept and that’s the reason you’re voting for him?’” he said. “And they’ll tell me, ‘Honestly, I can’t.’ It’s a buyer’s remorse. People are waking up.”At the same time, Bryce is not just progressive on economic issues. He supports the movement for black lives, abortion rights and universal gun background checks.

27,POLITICS,Here's The Story Behind The Fighter Pilot Who Made That Viral Campaign Ad,Travis Waldron,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amy-mcgrath-congress-campaign_us_59837619e4b08b75dcc5dfa0,"Retired Marine Amy McGrath is running for office to take out ""Mitch McConnell's hand-picked congressman.""",2017-08-06,Rep. Andy Barr (R-Ky.) has faced scrutiny from constituents in his district thanks to his support for repealing the Affordable Care Act.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5983786f1a00008381dc1f1d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Amy McGrath knew when she was 12 years old that she wanted to fly fighter jets. She also knew that she wasn’t allowed to.So McGrath launched an aggressive letter-writing campaign to lawmakers in her home state of Kentucky. She wrote to her congressman, who told her “women ought to be protected and not allowed to serve.” She then targeted Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, who never replied. Finally, she wrote to every member of the Armed Services committees in both houses of Congress. Most of them ignored her, so she tried writing letters to the editor for her local newspapers instead.In 1994, when McGrath was a senior at Notre Dame Academy in Park Hills, Kentucky, the Pentagon lifted its policy banning women from certain combat roles. McGrath enrolled in the U.S. Naval Academy the next year, joined the Marines after graduating in 1997, and, while serving three tours in Afghanistan and Iraq, became the first female Marine to fly a combat mission in an F/A-18 fighter jet.McGrath, 42, is now hoping a campaign of a different sort will find similar success. On Tuesday, McGrath announced her candidacy to become the first woman to ever represent Kentucky’s 6th Congressional District. Her announcement came in a two-minute online video that rooted her candidacy in her two decades of military experience ― and her fight to be allowed to serve. “At a very young age I had to learn about how government works, and I had to learn about democracy, and I had to learn about advocacy,” McGrath, who is running as a Democrat, told HuffPost. “It’s one of the reasons I consider myself more progressive, because it was progressive leaders in government that pushed for change. At a very young age, I knew that if it weren’t for them, I would not have had my job for the last 20 years.”A year ago, however, Congress was the furthest thing from her mind. McGrath, who had risen to the rank of lieutenant colonel, was teaching political science at the U.S. Naval Academy. Happily married with three children, she had already begun fantasizing about her approaching retirement and a move back to Kentucky.Then, Donald Trump won the presidency. Congressional Republicans launched a seemingly endless campaign to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the health care reform legislation that had helped millions of Americans ― including nearly 500,000 Kentuckians ― access health care. And Rep. Andy Barr, the Republican who holds the seat McGrath is pursuing, supported those repeal efforts, and FiveThirtyEight’s vote tracker indicates he has voted with Trump 97 percent of the time.As McGrath sees it, she was left with little choice.“A year ago if you were to tell me I was going to be running for Congress, I would have said, ‘You’re full of it,’” McGrath said. “But what started it for me was the 2016 election. I felt like we needed better leaders for the country.”McGrath is one of more than 11,000 women who have chosen to pursue public office in the wake of the 2016 election, according to EMILY’s List. McGrath sees herself as part of the fight to elect more women nationwide. But she also noted that she shares common ground with two other former Marine fighter pilots who have launched congressional campaigns as Democrats: Col. Dan Ward and Capt. Chuck Enderlin, her friends who are pursuing seats in Virginia and Georgia, respectively.Barr, a lawyer, has represented Kentucky’s 6th District since 2012, when he won a rematch against incumbent Rep. Ben Chandler (D) after a narrow loss two years prior. The district ― which includes Lexington, the state’s second largest city ― was a reliable Democratic stronghold for decades before transforming into a swing seat in the late 1970s. The district now leans Republican, according to the Cook Political Report, and Barr cruised to victories against low-profile opponents in both 2014 and 2016.McGrath said friends repeatedly asked her why she would consider running in Kentucky rather than choosing a state more friendly to Democrats. But even after 20 years away, McGrath felt a calling to come home to the Bluegrass State. McGrath grew up in Covington ― a Cincinnati suburb in northern Kentucky ― but she and her husband chose to settle in Georgetown, a smaller city that sits in the heart of the 6th District. The recent move could pose challenging as she pursues the seat, especially in a Democratic primary that includes Reggie Thomas, who has represented Lexington in the Kentucky state Senate since 2014. But McGrath has roots in central Kentucky: Her mother was among the first women to graduate from the University of Kentucky’s medical school, and her sister attended UK, too. And she points to her military service when addressing potential criticism about spending so much time out of the state. “Those of us in the military, we move around every two to three years, and we live all over the world. I lived a year of my life in a tent somewhere in the Middle East,” she said. “This is where I’m from. This is my home. Kentucky is my home.”McGrath, like many Democrats across the country, launched her campaign against Barr by focusing on her Republican representative’s support for repealing the Affordable Care Act.Barr is “Mitch McConnell’s hand-picked congressman who said he would vote ‘enthusiastically’ to take health care away from over a quarter million Kentuckians,” McGrath says in the ad, which was hailed nationally and earned her multiple appearances on cable news shows last week. (The video, incidentally, is the product of Mark Putnam, who produced “the best campaign ad of 2016” ― in which Jason Kander, a U.S. Senate candidate in Missouri and also a veteran, assembled an AR-15 while blindfolded.)That could be a strong selling point for a Democrat in this district, where Barr has faced protests at town halls and constituent meetings over his support for health care repeal efforts. Obamacare delivered substantial benefits to the district, and the repeal legislation he voted for would have stripped health care from nearly 50,000 of its residents, according to an analysis of Congressional Budget Office data from the liberal Center for American Progress.There is also a tinge of Democratic populism in McGrath’s early campaign, which she says will focus on appealing to both progressive, urban Lexington and the more rural areas around it, where people, she said, “feel like they’ve been left behind.” McGrath said she wants to hear from more residents before building out a concrete platform. But she has criticized Barr’s support for the Financial CHOICE Act, a bill that would have repealed major pieces of the Dodd-Frank financial reform act that passed in the wake of the Great Recession. That legislation, McGrath said, would be a boon to Wall Street, especially payday lenders ― an issue she cares about after her time in the Marines. “For 20 years I was a Marine Corps officer who had to have young Marines under me who were hurt by these payday lenders, who were preyed on,” McGrath said. “I’ve got to take Congressman Barr on this issue, because I know what it’s like to have people under me that have been hurt by them.”To McGrath, Barr’s support for repealing both Obamacare and Dodd-Frank, as well as his early stance on tax reform efforts she sees as an attempt to cut taxes for the rich, are proof that the congressman isn’t serving the interests of his constituents. “We need to have a leader,” she said. “Someone who represents the interests of the people, and doesn’t represent the monied interests.”Barr has so far avoided responding to McGrath’s criticism. “Congressman Barr is not focused on the Democrats’ intra-party fight, especially a year before the 2018 primary election,” his spokesman, Rick VanMeter, told the Lexington Herald-Leader. “Instead, he is focused on fighting for the values and interests of the people of the Sixth District in Congress, keeping his promises and doing the job he was elected to do. There will be a time in the future for politics, but now is the time to do the work of the American people.”Trump won Barr’s district with 52 percent of the vote last November, and Kentucky is among the few states where a majority of residents approve of the job he is doing as president. Still, McGrath doesn’t seem afraid to take on some of his most contentious policies ― especially when she can tie her stances to her military experience.She is critical, for instance, of Trump’s recent decision to ban transgender people from the military. “These people are patriotic Americans who stepped up to the plate,” she said. “Do you have my back when I’m getting shot at, are you competent, are you someone of integrity? That’s what we really care about.”And Trump’s attempt to ban immigrants and refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries, she said, “is a terrible policy” that amounts to “a strategic win” for the enemies she spent years fighting.“They want to pit America and Americans against their religion, and he just handed them the Powerball lottery,” McGrath said. “This is not a war that can be won by more bombs being dropped on people. It’s a war that’s going to be won ... in people’s minds. When you hand the enemy exactly what they want in order to make more propaganda, you’re creating more fighters. This ban does not get to the root of the problem, and it does not protect Americans.”Kentucky Democrats could use a victory. They hold just one of the state’s six congressional seats, and lost their grip on the governor’s mansion in 2015. In November, they lost total control of the state legislature for the first time in nearly a century. McGrath, however, said she believes she can be part of the comeback for the party both in the state and nationally. Democrats need to pick up 24 seats to regain control of Congress. “I’ve been in tough battles before,” McGrath said. “I want that challenge.”CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article said Capt. Chuck Enderlin is running for Congress in Florida; he is running in Georgia."

Most of the mistakes that companies make are easily avoided. When you do make mistakes, your best employees are the first to go, because they have the most options.If you can’t keep your best employees engaged, you can’t keep your best employees. While this should be common sense, it isn’t common enough. A survey by CEB found that one-third of star employees feel disengaged from their employer and are already looking for a new job.When you lose good employees, they don’t disengage all at once. Instead, their interest in their jobs slowly dissipates. Michael Kibler, who has spent much of his career studying this phenomenon, refers to it as brownout. Like dying stars, star employees slowly lose their fire for their jobs.“Brownout is different from burnout because workers afflicted by it are not in obvious crisis,” Kibler said. “They seem to be performing fine: putting in massive hours, grinding out work while contributing to teams, and saying all the right things in meetings. However, they are operating in a silent state of continual overwhelm, and the predictable consequence is disengagement.”In order to prevent brownout and to retain top talent, companies and managers must understand what they’re doing that contributes to this slow fade. The following practices are the worst offenders, and they must be abolished if you’re going to hang on to good employees.1. They make a lot of stupid rules. Companies need to have rules—that’s a given—but they don’t have to be shortsighted and lazy attempts at creating order. Whether it’s an overzealous attendance policy or taking employees’ frequent flier miles, even a couple of unnecessary rules can drive people crazy. When good employees feel like big brother is watching, they’ll find someplace else to work.2. They treat everyone equally. While this tactic works with school children, the workplace ought to function differently. Treating everyone equally shows your top performers that no matter how high they perform (and, typically, top performers are work horses), they will be treated the same as the bozo who does nothing more than punch the clock.3. They tolerate poor performance. It’s said that in jazz bands, the band is only as good as the worst player; no matter how great some members may be, everyone hears the worst player. The same goes for a company. When you permit weak links to exist without consequence, they drag everyone else down, especially your top performers.4. They don’t recognize accomplishments. It’s easy to underestimate the power of a pat on the back, especially with top performers who are intrinsically motivated. Everyone likes kudos, none more so than those who work hard and give their all. Rewarding individual accomplishments shows that you’re paying attention. Managers need to communicate with their people to find out what makes them feel good (for some, it’s a raise; for others, it’s public recognition) and then to reward them for a job well done. With top performers, this will happen often if you’re doing it right.5. They don’t care about people. More than half the people who leave their jobs do so because of their relationship with their boss. Smart companies make certain that their managers know how to balance being professional with being human. These are the bosses who celebrate their employees’ successes, empathize with those going through hard times, and challenge them, even when it hurts. Bosses who fail to really care will always have high turnover rates. It’s impossible to work for someone for eight-plus hours a day when they aren’t personally involved and don’t care about anything other than your output.6. They don’t show people the big picture. It may seem efficient to simply send employees assignments and move on, but leaving out the big picture is a deal breaker for star performers. Star performers shoulder heavier loads because they genuinely care about their work, so their work must have a purpose. When they don’t know what that is, they feel alienated and aimless. When they aren’t given a purpose, they find one elsewhere.7. They don’t let people pursue their passions. Google mandates that employees spend at least 20% of their time doing “what they believe will benefit Google most.” While these passion projects make major contributions to marquis Google products, such as Gmail and AdSense, their biggest impact is in creating highly engaged Googlers. Talented employees are passionate. Providing opportunities for them to pursue their passions improves their productivity and job satisfaction, but many managers want people to work within a little box. These managers fear that productivity will decline if they let people expand their focus and pursue their passions. This fear is unfounded. Studies have shown that people who are able to pursue their passions at work experience flow, a euphoric state of mind that is five times more productive than the norm.8. They don’t make things fun. If people aren’t having fun at work, then you’re doing it wrong. People don’t give their all if they aren’t having fun, and fun is a major protector against brownout. The best companies to work for know the importance of letting employees loosen up a little. Google, for example, does just about everything it can to make work fun—free meals, bowling allies, and fitness classes, to name a few. The idea is simple: if work is fun, you’ll not only perform better, but you’ll stick around for longer hours and an even longer career.Bringing It All TogetherManagers tend to blame their turnover problems on everything under the sun while ignoring the crux of the matter: people don’t leave jobs; they leave managers.

The current solo exhibition Julia Haft-Candell: The Infinite is an example of the virtuosity that this gallery maintains.An exhibition comprised of new ceramic work, the show is divided into three neat sections beginning with a stunning take on the infinite. Alone in the first gallery and dramatically viewed from an elevated platform at the gallery’s entrance, one descends to approach Wall Infinity: Weave where spectacle meets reverence. What starts off as a reductive symbol slowly transforms into something more complex, stretching indeed toward the infinite. An assemblage of small porcelain plates forms the sign for infinity, but underglazed onto the symbol is a meandering weave pattern that neither begins nor finishes on the object. Infinity indeed.Much of what the artist is attempting in this show is to create forms that assert ambiguity (a paradox in itself, really). The infinity symbol contains lines that come and go, it is assembled (impressively) as a series of separate small plates, roughly matching at each edge to continue the form. Avoiding that holy grail quest for perfection that slays so many reductive artists, Haft-Candell gives everything she makes a textured, handled touch.In the second room, a larger space at Parrasch Heijnen, the artist presents two quite different bodies of work. On the North wall are twenty-four shelves containing a rather loopy array of black & white ceramic constructions. Each harkens to one of a few simple, primal shapes, imperfectly repeated here. An accompanying newsprint zine assembled by the artist goes through the litany of these forms and the details behind each of their glyph-like patterning. Each of these sculptures are masterpieces of the unresolved, functionless vessels with symbology and form merged on surface and in essence. One has to summon the poetic to deal with the absurd, and the rhythms of these undulating pieces inspire more than prose. Contrasting to the evidence of their all-too-human formation is the clean presentation from Parrasch Heijnen, installing individual precise trapezoidal shelves to accommodate the artist’s visionary impulses.Part three of the exhibit features a large platform holding five sculptures each titled Weight. These mounds of clay sitting as primary forces have vague splashes of chroma in the otherwise black & white show. And yet the color simply neutralizes the earthen tones of the clay, a subtle delivery of the message of nuance which resonates throughout this show. An association of these works with Peter Voulkos is inevitable, while her twenty four works against the wall seem formal heirs to Ken Price. It is no accident then that Haft-Candell is showing with Parrasch Heijnen whose website lists the late Price and Voulkos as their gallery artists. Both of these giants have had well-received shows at the Los Angeles space despite it having been open less than two years.Considering the presence of these two masters of the clay medium, Haft-Candell holds her own. In one modest exhibition she has a few major accomplishments: First, she establishes a wild pictographic language (applied with underglazing on black clay); she works to consistently make the enigmatic tangible in all her finished pieces, which finally makes even the reductive dichotomy of black & white into something more cryptic. Julia Haft-Candell is among the leading ceramic artists of her generation - this exhibit is the right art in the right place at the right time.The show runs thru September 2."

In another, he hugs an Israeli army watch-tower, with heart-shaped emojis added alongside paint splashes and soot stains left by Palestinian demonstrations.The artist, who goes by the alias @LushSux and who Australian media have said comes from Melbourne, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.On Thursday, the Washington Post published a transcript of a conversation in which Trump pressured Mexico not to publicly oppose his plan to have it pay for a border wall that he says is needed to stop illegal immigration to the United States.“You know, you look at Israel – Israel has a wall and everyone said do not build a wall, walls do not work — 99.9 percent of people trying to come across that wall cannot get across and more,“Trump told Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, according to the transcript of the phone call in January.“Bibi Netanyahu told me the wall works,” he added, using Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s nickname.The Bethlehem wall has become a showcase of protest art voicing Palestinians’ fears that Israel’sWest Bank fence-and-concrete barrier is a land grab that may deny them a state.

31,POLITICS,What You Need To Know About The Grand Jury's Part In The Russia Probe,Nick Wing,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/grand-jury-trump-russia-investigation_us_598494c1e4b041356ebf7a9f,"Grand jurors investigate in secret, while their targets try to spin what's happening.",2017-08-05,Michael Flynn (right) has emerged as a key figure in the probe into potential collusion with Russia.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5984e2361400002000ecf4be.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The FBI’s investigation into potential collusion between President Donald Trump’s campaign and Russia appeared to kick into higher gear with news this week that special counsel Robert Mueller had enlisted a federal grand jury in Washington as part of his efforts. The grand jury reportedly began working in recent weeks, issuing subpoenas for documents related to former national security adviser Michael Flynn’s business dealings.The high-profile and intensely political nature of this investigation could put this grand jury under unusual pressure.The panel is reportedly not dedicated to the Russia probe alone and could have other cases on its docket as it meets weekly ― or every other week ― until the completion of its term. Grand jury proceedings take place largely in secret, meaning the public will likely learn little about what the jurors are hearing.But legal experts say the use of the grand jury suggests Mueller’s investigation is diving in deeper.The duty of a grand jury is to decide if there is probable cause to pursue criminal charges. Grand juries have the power to issue subpoenas for documents and for witness testimony, which is delivered under oath without the presence of a defense attorney. Prosecutors can thus use grand juries to investigate more expansive matters. If or when the prosecutors think there’s cause for an indictment, they will ask the grand jury to vote.A federal grand jury doesn’t need to reach a unanimous decision. Of the 16 to 23 Washington residents on the panel looking into possible collusion with Russia, only 12 need to vote yes to indict someone. Grand juries differ from trial juries, or petit juries, in a few other substantive ways. Although courts do vet grand jurors, the individuals who sit on these panels don’t go through the extensive process of voir dire, in which lawyers and judges ask about their opinions and backgrounds to ensure they can serve impartially on specific cases. “Grand juries line ’em up, file ’em in, sit ’em down and off you go, because grand juries often hear all manner of cases,” said Andrew Leipold, a professor at the University of Illinois College of Law and an expert in grand juries. “They might hear several cases in a day, a drug crime here, a gun possession there, a fraud case, and so it’s impossible really to sort of track the way you would with a trial jury what are your particular biases and what are your leanings about this and that.”In Washington, which voted almost 91 percent for Hillary Clinton in November, the partisan makeup of the grand jury likely leans heavily against Trump.The D.C. grand jury is one of at least two such federal panels examining the Trump team in the wake of the 2016 election. A grand jury in eastern Virginia, not far from Washington, has been looking into Flynn’s ties to foreign agents. That region of Virginia also leans heavily blue.Additional grand jury subpoenas have reportedly been issued in connection with the June 2016 meeting between top Trump campaign officials ― including the president’s oldest son, Donald Trump Jr.; son-in-law Jared Kushner; and then-campaign manager Paul Manafort ― and a Russian lawyer with links to the Kremlin.Although the identities of grand jurors are sealed to the public, there’s no reason to believe they aren’t a range of ordinary Americans.“There will be some retirees, there will be some people with jobs, but like jury service everywhere, they get time off,” said Leipold.But in a case of this magnitude, even ordinary people attract attention.“The challenge in a high-profile political case is always confidentiality, keeping reporters from trying to figure out who the grand jurors are,” said Solomon L. Wisenberg, a Washington attorney who served as deputy independent counsel in the multi-branched investigation that ultimately looked into President Bill Clinton’s relations with Monica Lewinsky.Reporters regularly staked out the federal courthouse on grand jury days in hopes of identifying jurors, Wisenberg recalled.The federal rules that bind prosecutors and jurors to secrecy don’t apply to the witnesses who testify. There’s nothing keeping those individuals from telling the media or other potential targets of an investigation what they’ve been asked.“If a witness comes out and says, ‘They’re asking me questions about Michael Flynn,’ that’s fine,” Leipold explained. “Or if he goes back to the president and says, ‘Here’s the six questions they asked me,’ there’s nothing improper about that.”For this reason, Mueller’s team is likely proceeding cautiously as it decides which witnesses to call in what order and what to ask them, as well as which documents it seeks, Leipold said.The dynamic of witnesses who can talk, and prosecutors and jurors who can’t, can be twisted in another way.“You can easily have a pro-defense witness who leaks something about the grand jury ― or doesn’t even leak ― and there’s a press story and the person under investigation says, ‘See, [the prosecution] is leaking,’” said Wisenberg.Such a maneuver wouldn’t be without precedent.“There were certainly strong, strong suspicions that President Clinton, when he was being investigated by a grand jury, would release information that was damaging to him and then claim it was leaked by the prosecutor’s office,” said Leipold.President Trump has already made attempts to undermine Mueller’s work by claiming the special counsel’s team is filled with “Hillary Clinton supporters” who have embarked on a “witch hunt” to derail his presidency. He has also reportedly dispatched lawyers and aides to dig up any possible dirt that could be used as grounds to fire Mueller or oust members of his staff.But short of mass firings, the investigation is going forward, legal experts say. And efforts to disrupt it could create additional problems in Trump’s circle.“A huge amount of the trouble that white collar and corporate and political criminals get into, it’s not so much what they do, but the way they react to the investigation,” said Ken White, a defense attorney at Brown, White & Osborn in Los Angeles who writes on the law-oriented blog Popehat.If witnesses before the grand juries end up lying under oath and obstructing justice, that could lead to serious consequences. They could also flip on their associates and reveal new and incriminating information. Either way, this is a particular dangerous phase for Trumpland, said White.“Trump’s team is like a pack of blind drunks stumbling into a minefield here,” he said. “Unless they learn discipline very late in life very rapidly, I think they’re in real trouble.”Matt Ferner contributed reporting."

A marijuana company purchased the entire town of Nipton, California, for $5 million this week as part of a new cannabis tourism venture.Phoenix-based American Green announced that the 120-acre plot will eventually become the “country’s first energy-independent, cannabis-friendly hospitality destination.”The company plans to keep the existing infrastructure, which includes a hotel and a trading post, and invite other marijuana-friendly businesses to set up shop as it expands.Nipton made a name for itself in the early 1900s as a gold rush town and a rest stop for the railroad industry. It was put on the market last year after its owner, Gerald Freeman, said he was too old to manage it. Freeman died shortly thereafter, according to NPR. About 20 people currently call Nipton home.“We are excited to lead the charge for a true ‘Green Rush,’” David Gwyther, president of American Green, said in a press release. “The Cannabis Revolution that’s going on here in the US, has the power to completely revitalize communities in the same way gold did during the 19th century.” The company plans to start by infusing local water with CBD ― the cannabinoid said to have relieving effects and that doesn’t get you high ― and distributing it through California. Eventually, though, it’ll have everything a typical cute bed-and-breakfast town has, except you probably won’t have to sneak out to the back porch to light up.American Green will spend some $2.5 million in the next 18 months to rebuild Nipton into a stoner’s paradise, according to the company’s release. It plans to expand on the town’s small solar farm and aims to add “CBD and mineral baths, cannabis-product retail outposts, artists-in-residence programs, culinary events, and Bed-and-Breakfast lodging to complete the charming small town experience.”Marijuana is still illegal at the federal level, but more than one-fifth of U.S. residents can light up legally thanks to legalization and decriminalization measures that have passed in certain states.No word yet on how Weed, California, feels about another town pushing into its tourism ― who’s going to take pictures in front of that one sign after Nipton takes off?"

The 45th president has no problem wolfing down a Quarter Pounder or digging his way through a bucket of KFC. ”Great stuff,” he once called the cheap, greasy fare.Six months into Trump’s presidency, the fast-food industry has plenty of reason to love him back.The oil and gas sector, coal producers and for-profit colleges are all clear winners in the Trump team’s mission to deconstruct the administrative state. But so far, fast food, retail and other lower-wage industries have benefited as much as anyone from the administration’s great regulatory rollback.Lobbyists for restaurants, hotels and other franchised businesses spent the last several years fighting the Obama administration on one regulation after another. But the new White House occupant has heard their grievances, making industry-friendly changes to employment laws and how they’re enforced. That’s included abandoning Obama’s overtime reforms, shying away from a minimum wage raise, and limiting who’s considered an “employer” under the law ― all of which have a disproportionate effect on lower-wage, labor-intensive fields like fast food. All told, the new administration has given McDonald’s and its friends plenty to cheer about. “The early signs are that it can be more like night and day in terms of approach,” said Matt Haller, senior vice president at the International Franchise Association, an industry group representing franchisers, including McDonald’s. “We just want regulations that are fair and reasonable and very clear.” The previous White House viewed regulation as a means to lift up workers at the bottom of the economic ladder, particularly folks doing low-paid service work like fast food and hospitality. Hence their push for a higher mandated wage floor, expanded overtime protections and aggressive enforcement of wage and hour laws. Like Obama, Trump speaks often of forgotten workers whose pay has stagnated, but so far his prescription for improving their lot mainly involves unfettering their employers.That shouldn’t come as a surprise for a president who made his fortune in hotels and went on to nominate a burger chain executive to be the country’s top workplace watchdog. (Andrew Puzder, the former CEO of Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr., ended up withdrawing his controversial nomination.) Still, the degree to which the administration is taking the reins off employers has distressed past officials who took a more aggressive tack.“It’s the combination of these policies that’s deeply troubling,” said David Weil, who led the Labor Department’s Wage and Hour Division under Obama. “I see very little evidence that they are doing anything to address the needs of working people who have been left behind for a long time.”While he was in office, Weil tried to steer the agency’s investigations toward the industries where he saw the most vulnerable workers ― fast food, sit-down restaurants, hotels and motels, janitorial companies and so forth. A Labor Department spokesman said the agency under Trump still carries out what it calls “targeted enforcement” programs. But pressed on whether they were targeting the same low-wage fields as before, the spokesman declined to say.Some of the changes under Trump have little practical impact, but speak volumes about the administration’s peculiar form of populism.Employers in food and hospitality were apoplectic over the Obama administration’s view on “joint employment”: the idea that more than one entity might be responsible when a worker gets injured or shorted on pay. The Obama administration put companies on notice that they, too, could be responsible for abuses against workers who are technically employed by temp firms and contractors. Fast-food brands like McDonald’s recoiled at the idea they might be as liable for workplace violations as the franchisees who operate McDonald’s restaurants.After Trump’s second pick for labor secretary, Alexander Acosta, assumed office in April, one of the first steps the agency took was to rescind the guidance on joint employment issued under Obama. Speaking to a retail lobby last month, Vice President Mike Pence proudly noted the change, drawing applause.In another early move, the Labor Department brought back what are known as “opinion letters.” When employers are sued for allegedly not paying overtime or the minimum wage, they can ask the Labor Department to pen one of these letters in their defense, to be used in court. Weil likens them to a “get-out-of-jail-free card” for employers, and the Obama administration did not issue them. Trump’s Labor Department, however, has trumpeted their return. Trump also rescinded an executive order from Obama that would have made it harder for firms to secure federal contracts if they have a documented history of wage theft. Obama’s order was the result of a campaign by fast-food workers who had been shorted on their pay while working on federal properties. (Two other orders from Obama ― one raising the minimum wage for federal contractors and another mandating sick leave for them ― have so far survived this administration.)Other changes on the employment front are far more significant. The Obama administration tried to reform the nation’s overtime rules and guarantee more workers time and a half pay when they work more than 40 hours in a week. The share of salaried employees who are protected by overtime law has dropped off a cliff since the 1970s. The changes the Obama administration made would have extended overtime rights to 4 million additional workers, according to the previous White House.After business groups sued to stop Obama’s plan, the Trump White House declined to defend it. The new administration seems to share the view of business groups that Obama’s proposal covered too many workers and was too costly for employers. If Trump takes his own crack at overtime reform, it’s likely he’ll make far fewer workers eligible for time and a half pay.Many of the people Obama’s reforms aimed to help work in food and retail jobs, earning relatively low salaries while clocking long days. A group of Chipotle workers recently sued the burrito chain for backpay, arguing Obama’s overtime changes should still apply even though the rule is now in legal limbo. The case hasn’t yet been decided.As with the overtime expansion, this White House has abandoned the push for a higher minimum wage made by Obama. The idea of hiking the minimum wage tends to poll well across party lines; although he flip-flopped on the issue as a candidate, Trump once said he would like to raise it to “at least $10.” But so far as president, he seems intent to leave such matters to the market. The federal minimum wage, which prevails in any state without a higher one, is currently $7.25 per hour and hasn’t been raised in eight years.Beyond the major policy shifts, Trump’s effect on low-wage work will be felt in less obvious ways. He recently made two nominations to the five-member National Labor Relations Board, which interprets collective bargaining law and referees disputes between employers and unions. His conservative choices ― one is a management-side attorney, the other a former GOP staffer who served on the House labor committee ― would end the current liberal majority and push the board to the right. (One of them has already been confirmed.)If history is any indication, the Republican board would likely reverse some union-friendly rulings and draw tighter boundaries around who’s eligible to unionize. Celine McNicholas, a labor policy expert at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, said the board is one way Trump could chip away at what she considered modest gains made for lower-income workers during the Obama years.“These potential setbacks are going to prove to be incredibly damaging, particularly for folks who are low-wage workers,” McNicholas said. “They are certainly losers under the Trump administration.”One potential beneficiary of the new board is McDonald’s. The fast-food giant recently went to trial before an administrative law judge at the labor board to determine whether it counts as a joint employer alongside its franchisees; McDonald’s could be held jointly responsible for violating workers’ rights. In general, a conservative labor board would be more likely to side with employers in such contentious cases.The board’s general counsel, Richard Griffin, who functions as a quasi-prosecutor, brought the case against McDonald’s on behalf of workers who claimed they’d been illegally retaliated against for their activism in the Fight for $15 protests. A former union lawyer, Griffin assumed the post in 2013 and has been a thorn in the side of not just McDonald’s but also Walmart and other employers he’s taken to trial. His aggressive tenure has so infuriated business groups that some Republicans have demanded that he step down.But at this point, that would no longer be necessary. Griffin’s four-year term expires in November. It will be up to Trump to choose his replacement."

35,POLITICS,A Hard-Fought Victory To Restore Tribal Land Faces New Threat In Trump Era,Chris D'Angelo,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ryan-zinke-interior-tribal-land-program_us_5985042ee4b08b75dcc7043a,What happened to respecting Native American sovereignty?,2017-08-05,An indigenous activist waves an upside-down U.S. flag with an image of Sitting Bull on it during a protest march and rally in front of the White House on March 10. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5985058c1400001f00ecf4d5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — Along with being a self-proclaimed champion of public lands, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke vowed to be an advocate for America’s indigenous communities and their right to self-determination.“Sovereignty should mean something,” the former Montana congressman told the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs during a January confirmation hearing. And after being sworn in, Zinke issued a statement in which he said “our sovereign Indian Nations and territories must have the respect and freedom they deserve.”But a major change to the Department of the Interior’s Land Buy-Back Program for Tribal Nations, which addresses the widespread problem in Indian Country of land parcels being owned by sometimes hundreds of tribal members, is the latest example of Zinke and the Trump administration not living up to their promises to native peoples, former Interior officials say.The Land Buy-Back Program targets land fractionation, which can threaten tribal sovereignty. As parcels of land granted to tribal members in the 1880s have been handed down from one generation to the next, ownership has been divided, or fractionated, among the heirs. With so many shared interests — in some cases, parcels have over 1,000 owners — lands have become all but impossible to use. Through the program, the federal government purchases fractional land interests from individual owners and restores tribal jurisdiction over the land. The Interior Department announced a “revised strategy” Monday that it says “will more effectively allocate” the remaining $540 million from the landmark settlement in Cobell v. Salazar, money to be used to buy the multiple titles to individual land parcels. Not mentioned in the release, however, is that the decision cuts dozens of tribes out of the program entirely. The proposed change to the program “represents everything that Indian Country has come to fear from Secretary Zinke’s leadership,” said one former Department of Interior official who requested anonymity to comment candidly. It’s “a solution in search of a problem that doesn’t exist; an effort to undermine an Obama Administration initiative for the sake of being contrary; and a move that will widely impact Indian communities without any formal government-to-government consultation,” the former official said in an email. The Interior Department did not respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment. The Land Buy-Back Program kicked off in 2013, the fruit of a 13-year class-action lawsuit against the federal government. Elouise Cobell, a member of the Blackfeet Nation in Montana, and several other Native Americans filed suit against the Interior and Treasury departments in 1996. The plaintiffs argued that the federal government had mismanaged Individual Indian Monies accounts — in which the government deposits money collected from activities on land held in trust for Native Americans, including timber sales, agricultural leases and oil, gas and mineral production — shortchanging Native Americans by $150 billion. The case was ultimately settled in 2009 for $3.4 billion: $1.4 billion was divvied up among more than 300,000 individual plaintiffs and $1.9 billion was set aside for the purchase of fractional interests from willing sellers at fair market value, with the land ultimately to be turned over to reservations.The Land Buy-Back Program has been widely viewed as a success, both in terms of helping to restore the relationship between the federal government and indigenous tribes and promoting economic growth in Indian Country. The program has paid out $1.2 billion to landowners at 45 locations in the last four years, consolidating more than 700,000 fractional interests — a 23 percent reduction — and transferring over 2.1 million acres back to tribal governments, according to the Interior Department.Nevertheless, Interior’s Associate Deputy Secretary Jim Cason — who has been compared to James Watt, President Ronald Reagan’s controversial interior secretary — has labeled the program a failure.At a May hearing of the House Committee on Natural Resources’ Subcommittee on Indian, Insular and Alaska Native Affairs, Cason described it as a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” that “has made relatively little progress in resolving this ongoing problem.” And he said the way the Obama administration ran the program made it “a very good deal for tribal leaders.” “I don’t think there’s any tribal leader that would say, ‘Gee — I don’t want free money,’” he said, seeming to ignore the fact that Native Americans were the original occupants of these lands, that the lands were forcibly taken from them and that the settlement belongs to indigenous tribes.Former agency officials HuffPost contacted took issue with both Cason’s statements and Interior’s recent decision to narrow the scope of the program. David Hayes, the Interior Department’s deputy secretary under President Barack Obama, said the Cobell settlement is “historic and important” for both the government and Indian Country. Cason’s comments, he said, “greatly disrespect” efforts to “right the historical wrongs that were addressed in the Cobell litigation,” as well as the memory of Elouise Cobell, who died of cancer in 2011. “This was a settlement that was endorsed by Congress and that was designed to help address a fundamental problem in fractionated ownership in Indian Country, and returning lands that were essentially useless and tied up … back into the control of sovereign tribes,” Hayes said. “You can’t get more fundamental in terms of sovereignty than that.” “Denigrating the notion of a settlement and the purpose of the buy-back program is disturbing,” he added. Elizabeth Klein, who served as associate deputy secretary under two interior secretaries, Sally Jewell and Ken Salazar, told HuffPost the program is complex, often requiring difficult decisions be made. The Obama administration understood $1.9 billion would not be enough to solve the problem, but its approach was to open the program to as many tribes as possible, she said. In May 2016, it expanded the program to include 105 tribes, up from the 42 it initially identified in November 2014. As of last month, 45 tribal nations had either accepted or received offers. The Trump administration’s new implementation schedule, however, includes just 20 reservations or tribal territories, including 12 where landowners previously received offers. Five reservations are located in Zinke’s home state of Montana. The move summarily removes more than 50 tribes from having a chance to benefit from the program. In its announcement, Interior said its revised strategy is based on several factors — including the complexity of the land ownership, cost and something it called “tribal readiness” — and followed “extensive analysis and feedback received from tribal leaders and American Indian landowners.” It said it “will continually assess progress and may revise the schedule or add locations as capacity and resources allow, depending on the results achieved.”“If your goal is to repair a damaged relationship that’s existed for decades if not centuries with tribal governments and tribal people, this doesn’t strike me as the way to do it,” Klein said. Keith Harper, an attorney who represented the plaintiffs in the Cobell case and later served as a U.S. ambassador under Obama, said the change is “significant,” “ill-informed” and “undermines” the deal the federal government agreed to.“I think the most problematic part of this is that it only considers the interests of the department, and that was not the initial intent of the settlement,” Harper said.A former Interior official told HuffPost there was no consultation with tribal leaders about the changes. Instead, they received letters from Cason, addressed “Dear Tribal Leader” and sent out less than an hour before Interior published its press release online. In the letter, shared with HuffPost, Cason said he recognizes “some of you will be disappointed” and that “several tribes commented that they have invested energy and resources in preparation for implementation of the program.” However, the agency’s analysis showed that the new direction “most effectively maximizes the remaining dollars.”Hayes said the “primary test” for the Trump administration’s relationship with Indian Country is whether it engages government-to-government with tribes on key federal decisions. He said he was not aware of the details surrounding the administration’s decision, but “if tribes were dropped from the plan without consultation, that would not, I think, be consistent with the early promises of the administration to fully respect sovereignty.”HuffPost reached out to several tribes cut from Interior’s list. Two, the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma and the Kalispel Tribe of Washington, responded. Kimberly Teehee, the Cherokee Nation’s vice president of government relations and Obama’s senior policy adviser for Native American affairs, said her tribe was not consulted. Like others, it received a letter outlining the revised strategy and list. Given previous outreach by Interior’s Office of the Special Trustee for American Indians, Teehee said, the Cherokee Nation had a certain “expectation” that it would have an opportunity to participate. There are unique federal laws that apply to the Cherokee Nation, and the tribe had been working with the office of Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) to find a way to fully access the land buy-back program, she said.Teehee added that she found Monday’s announcement “concerning”; however, she remains hopeful that the agency will revise its schedule to again include the Cherokee tribe.  A representative of the Kalispel Tribe said it would not be able to comment due to summer schedules and the kickoff of its annual powwow.Klein sees this week’s announcement as part of an emerging trend of “knee-jerk reactions” from the Trump administration that target Obama-era policies and programs. This is also not the first time Zinke and the Trump administration’s commitment to Native Americans has been called into question. In March, following months of protests in North Dakota near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, thousands of demonstrators, including members of dozens of indigenous tribes, marched in the nation’s capital against the Dakota Access Pipeline and President Donald Trump. The demonstration came after Trump signed an executive order aimed at pushing the controversial project forward and the Army approved a final construction permit. Seeming to ignore the concerns of Native American groups and environmentalist, Trump stressed that the project would create “a lot of jobs, 28,000 jobs. Great construction jobs.” In May, members of the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition — a group of five Native American tribes that petitioned the designation of Utah’s Bears Ears National monument — traveled to Washington, D.C., to demand the administration meet with them and hear their concerns about its controversial plan to review monument designations. While Zinke subsequently sat down with members of the coalition, he ultimately recommended that Trump shrink the boundaries of the 1.35 million-acre Utah monument — a decision the coalition called a “slap in the face to the members of our Tribes and an affront to Indian people all across the country.”Zinke caused a similar stir last weekend during a visit to Nevada, where he toured Gold Butte and Basin and Range national monuments as part of his monument review. The Las Vegas Review Journal reported that Zinke backed out of meetings with local Paiute tribes, Rep. Dina Titus (D-Nev.) and others who want to see the monuments remain intact.“[It] felt like empty promises from the government … for him to dismiss us as Native Americans, not just my tribe but the Las Vegas tribe,” Darren Daboda, chairman of the Moapa Band of Paiutes, told the newspaper. “We sort of felt like we’re treated like second-class citizens.”And while Zinke has spoken about the need to improve Indian education and health care, the Trump administration’s budget proposal calls for slashing the budget of the Interior Department’s Bureau of Indian Affairs by more than 10 percent. That includes a $64.4 million cut to Indian education programs. If approved, it would “absolutely decimate Indian education,” Ahniwake Rose, executive director of the National Indian Education Association and member of the Cherokee and Muscogee Creek Nation, said at the time.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated the location of the Kalispel Tribe. It is located in Washington, not Montana. "
36,POLITICS,A Hard-Fought Victory To Restore Tribal Land Faces New Threat In Trump Era,Chris D'Angelo,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ryan-zinke-interior-tribal-land-program_us_5985042ee4b08b75dcc7043a,What happened to respecting Native American sovereignty?,2017-08-05,Former Deputy Interior Secretary David Hayes says a “primary test” for the Trump administration is whether it engages government-to-government with Native Americans on federal decisions. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/598507a11500007d208b5325.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — Along with being a self-proclaimed champion of public lands, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke vowed to be an advocate for America’s indigenous communities and their right to self-determination.“Sovereignty should mean something,” the former Montana congressman told the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs during a January confirmation hearing. And after being sworn in, Zinke issued a statement in which he said “our sovereign Indian Nations and territories must have the respect and freedom they deserve.”But a major change to the Department of the Interior’s Land Buy-Back Program for Tribal Nations, which addresses the widespread problem in Indian Country of land parcels being owned by sometimes hundreds of tribal members, is the latest example of Zinke and the Trump administration not living up to their promises to native peoples, former Interior officials say.The Land Buy-Back Program targets land fractionation, which can threaten tribal sovereignty. As parcels of land granted to tribal members in the 1880s have been handed down from one generation to the next, ownership has been divided, or fractionated, among the heirs. With so many shared interests — in some cases, parcels have over 1,000 owners — lands have become all but impossible to use. Through the program, the federal government purchases fractional land interests from individual owners and restores tribal jurisdiction over the land. The Interior Department announced a “revised strategy” Monday that it says “will more effectively allocate” the remaining $540 million from the landmark settlement in Cobell v. Salazar, money to be used to buy the multiple titles to individual land parcels. Not mentioned in the release, however, is that the decision cuts dozens of tribes out of the program entirely. The proposed change to the program “represents everything that Indian Country has come to fear from Secretary Zinke’s leadership,” said one former Department of Interior official who requested anonymity to comment candidly. It’s “a solution in search of a problem that doesn’t exist; an effort to undermine an Obama Administration initiative for the sake of being contrary; and a move that will widely impact Indian communities without any formal government-to-government consultation,” the former official said in an email. The Interior Department did not respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment. The Land Buy-Back Program kicked off in 2013, the fruit of a 13-year class-action lawsuit against the federal government.

Dr. Travis Bradberry explains 12 habits that set exceptional leaders apart.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59667c632100001b00fc6980.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One of the most popular Dilbert comic strips in the cartoon’s history begins with Dilbert’s boss relaying senior leadership’s explanation for the company’s low profits. In response to his boss, Dilbert asks incredulously, “So they’re saying that profits went up because of great leadership and down because of a weak economy?” To which Dilbert’s boss replies, “These meetings will go faster if you stop putting things in context.”Great leadership is indeed a difficult thing to pin down and understand. You know a great leader when you’re working for one, but even they can have a hard time explaining the specifics of what they do that makes their leadership so effective. Great leadership is dynamic; it melds a variety of unique skills into an integrated whole.Below are 12 essential behaviors that exceptional leaders rely on every day. Give them a try and you can become a better leader today.1. Courage“Courage is the first virtue that makes all other virtues possible.” —AristotlePeople will wait to see if a leader is courageous before they’re willing to follow his or her lead. People need courage in their leaders. They need someone who can make difficult decisions and watch over the good of the group. They need a leader who will stay the course when things get tough. People are far more likely to show courage themselves when their leaders do the same.For the courageous leader adversity is a welcome test. Like a blacksmith’s molding of a red-hot iron, adversity is a trial by fire that refines leaders and sharpens their game. Adversity emboldens courageous leaders and leaves them more committed to their strategic direction.Leaders who lack courage simply toe the company line. They follow the safest path—the path of least resistance—because they’d rather cover their backside than lead.2. Effective Communication“The more elaborate our means of communication, the less we communicate.” —Joseph PriestleyCommunication is the real work of leadership. It’s a fundamental element of how leaders accomplish their goals each and every day. You simply can’t become a great leader until you are a great communicator.Great communicators inspire people. They create a connection with their followers that is real, emotional, and personal, regardless of any physical distance between them. Great communicators forge this connection through an understanding of people and an ability to speak directly to their needs.3. Generosity“A good leader is a person who takes a little more than his share of the blame and a little less than his share of the credit.” —John MaxwellGreat leaders are generous. They share credit and offer enthusiastic praise. They’re as committed to their followers’ success as they are to their own. They want to inspire all of their employees to achieve their personal best – not just because it will make the team more successful, but because they care about each person as an individual.4. Humility“Humility is not thinking less of yourself, it’s thinking of yourself less.” —C.S. LewisGreat leaders are humble. They don’t allow their position of authority to make them feel that they are better than anyone else. As such, they don’t hesitate to jump in and do the dirty work when needed, and they won’t ask their followers to do anything they wouldn’t be willing to do themselves.5. Self-Awareness“It is absurd that a man should rule others, who cannot rule himself.” —Latin ProverbContrary to what Dilbert might have us believe, leaders’ gaps in self-awareness are rarely due to deceitful, Machiavellian motives, or severe character deficits. In most cases, leaders—like everyone else—view themselves in a more favorable light than other people do.Self-awareness is the foundation of emotional intelligence, a skill that 90% of top performing leaders possess in abundance. Great leaders’ high self-awareness means they have a clear and accurate image not just of their leadership style, but also of their own strengths and weaknesses. They know where they shine and where they’re weak, and they have effective strategies for leaning into their strengths and compensating for their weaknesses.6. Adherence to the Golden Rule +1“The way you see people is the way you treat them, and the way you treat them is what they become.” —Jon Wolfgang von GoetheThe Golden Rule – treat others as you want to be treated – assumes that all people are the same. It assumes that, if you treat your followers the way you would want a leader to treat you, they’ll be happy. It ignores that people are motivated by vastly different things. One person loves public recognition, while another loathes being the center of attention.Great leaders don’t treat people how they themselves want to be treated. Instead, they take the Golden Rule a step further and treat each person as he or she would like to be treated. Great leaders learn what makes people tick, recognize their needs in the moment, and adapt their leadership style accordingly.7. Passion“If you just work on stuff that you like and are passionate about, you don’t have to have a master plan with how things will play out.” —Mark ZuckerbergPassion and enthusiasm are contagious. So are boredom and apathy. No one wants to work for a boss that’s unexcited about his or her job, or even one who’s just going through the motions. Great leaders are passionate about what they do, and they strive to share that passion with everyone around them.8. Infectiousness“The very essence of leadership is that you have to have a vision. It’s got to be a vision you articulate clearly and forcefully on every occasion. You can’t blow an uncertain trumpet.” —Reverend Theodore HesburghGreat leaders know that having a clear vision isn’t enough. You have to make that vision come alive so that your followers can see it just as clearly as you do. Great leaders do that by telling stories and painting verbal pictures so that everyone can understand not just where they’re going, but what it will look and feel like when they get there. This inspires others to internalize the vision and make it their own.9. Authenticity“Just be who you are and speak from your guts and heart – it’s all a man has.” —Hubert HumphreyAuthenticity refers to being honest in all things – not just what you say and do, but who you are. When you’re authentic, your words and actions align with who you claim to be. Your followers shouldn’t be compelled to spend time trying to figure out if you have ulterior motives. Any time they spend doing so erodes their confidence in you and in their ability to execute.Leaders who are authentic are transparent and forthcoming. They aren’t perfect, but they earn people’s respect by walking their talk.10. Approachability“Management is like holding a dove in your hand. Squeeze too hard and you kill it, not hard enough and it flies away.” —Tommy LasordaGreat leaders make it clear that they welcome challenges, criticism, and viewpoints other than their own. They know that an environment where people are afraid to speak up, offer insight, and ask good questions is destined for failure. By ensuring that they are approachable, great leaders facilitate the flow of great ideas throughout the organization.11. Accountability“The ancient Romans had a tradition: Whenever one of their engineers constructed an arch, as the capstone was hoisted into place, the engineer assumed accountability for his work in the most profound way possible: He stood under the arch.” —Michael ArmstrongGreat leaders have their followers’ backs. They don’t try to shift blame, and they don’t avoid shame when they fail. They’re never afraid to say, “The buck stops here,” and they earn people’s trust by backing them up.12. Sense Of Purpose“You don’t lead by pointing and telling people some place to go. You lead by going to that place and making a case.” —Ken KeseyWhereas vision is a clear idea of where you’re going, a sense of purpose refers to an understanding of why you’re going there. People like to feel like they’re part of something bigger than themselves. Great leaders give people that feeling.Bringing It All TogetherBecoming a great leader doesn’t mean that you have to incorporate all of these traits at once. Focus on one or two at a time; each incremental improvement will make you more effective. It’s okay if you “act” some of these qualities at first. The more you practice, the more instinctive it will become, and the more you’ll internalize your new leadership style.What other qualities would you like to see added to this list? Please share your thoughts on exceptional leadership in the comments section, as I learn just as much from you as you do from me.Want to learn more from me?

Her focus remains the same: Removing the anxiety around her own sensory triggers, which include making eye contact.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59848910210000a134fca303.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When Xolie Morra Cogley greets clients at her dog grooming business in Seattle, she struggles to make eye contact, a common trait among people with autism. Once the customers leave, eye contact with the dogs is much easier ― and essential. Cogley, 37, who describes herself as an “autistic woman of all trades,” said she’s trained herself to keep eye contact with her four-legged charges to establish the essential leadership role in order to avoid aggression and bites. People are a different story. But Cogley said they are understanding of her eye shifts when she explains why.“I choose to tell them when I get the feeling that they are having a hard time understanding my different expression of anxiety,” she added.Cogley, who has performed on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” with her band, Xolie Morra and the Strange Kind, stresses that she has made a conscious choice to educate others about her autism. However, she said she respects the feelings of those who choose not to discuss their diagnosis.“Sometimes, people start to treat me differently, because they think I’m not paying attention,” she said. “Or [they don’t] understand some of the things that I do, like hand-flapping, when I’m overwhelmed.”There’s another common misunderstanding, even among people educated on autism: that lack of eye contact indicates a lack of empathy or connection. The idea stems from British psychologists Simon Baron-Cohen and Uta Frith, who coined the term “mindblindness” in the 1980s, referring to what they considered to bethe core deficit in autism. By their definition, this indicated a person with autism’s inability to employ the “theory of mind.” Baron-Cohen and Frith’s theory states that autistic people lack the ability to imagine the thoughts and feelings of others. However, findings in a new study appear to debunk this theory.The study published in June in Scientific Reports reveals that people with autism spectrum disorder avoid eye contact because it causes anxiety, and not as an unintentional demonstration of lack of empathy. Not only does this validate what people with autism have been saying for years, it also suggests we’ve been applying wrong ideas to therapeutic intervention for kids with autism.In the report, scientists revealed the discovery of a part of the brain responsible for helping newborns turn their heads toward familiar faces is abnormally activated in individuals with autism, leading to increased anxiety due to overstimulation. Researchers said their results show pushing individuals to look therapists in the eye during behavioral sessions could be “counterproductive,” and doing so may create more anxiety. “However, by not looking at the eyes, the person with ASD will continue to miss critical social information, and somehow one has to help them to gather all these important cues,” researchers stated in the report. “One possible strategy could consist in progressively habituating individuals with ASD to look into the eyes, analogous to the way surgeons habituate to look at open bleeding bodies, and then in incentivizing them to look at the eyes, finding a way to make eye contact somehow less stressful.”These findings also reflect on the many apps that are built around modeling making eye contact and other socially expected behaviors for children on the spectrum, such as Ikor & Egor: Animation for Autism and Look in My Eyes: Steam Train, which may be doing more harm than good, according to some experts.Dr. Susan Fletcher-Watson, who heads up the Development Autism Research Society, or DART, at the University of Edinburgh, argues that training autistic individuals to make eye contact is a bit like a left-handed person training themselves to write with the opposite hand.“There’s no real evidence that improving eye-contact leads to better friendships or real world adjustment,” Fletcher-Watson says in a blog on DART’s site. “If eye contact makes the neurotypical community feel more comfortable, maybe it is our responsibility instead to learn to adapt to the interactive style of autistic people. If we’re so ‘socially skilled,’ then why are we so bad at doing this?”History shows that eye contact is tied to our earliest survival instincts as a species, granting children with the ability to attract attention through eye contact a greater chance of being fed. Moreover, eye contact is associated with trust in Western society.Then again, perspective is everything.It is important to note differing cultural beliefs concerning eye contact. In the Japanese and Navajo cultures, for example, it is considered rude to make direct eye contact with strangers, elders, and people of the opposite sex. In the West, someone who seeks out and maintains eye contact is more likely to be viewed as a leader. Doctors are perceived to be more caring simply for looking their patients in the eye. Therefore, it’s easy to see how people with autism have been mistakenly labeled as being uncaring and lacking empathy toward others. And yet, the onus still seems to fall on the person with autism to meet people who are not on the spectrum with a confident and steady gaze, as opposed to the other way around.Many in the autism community, including neurotypical parents raising children with autism, have learned to cope with this expectation and even come up with innovative ways to overcome the issue.Kara Tyler, a 39-year-old Baltimore resident, is the mother of a 14-year-old girl with ASD. Instead of working against her brain, Tyler revealed how she taught her child to feign eye contact for the comfort of others, without inviting overstimulation.“I taught my kiddo to look between people’s eyebrows,” she said. “People register it as eye contact and it doesn’t make them feel as on the spot.”For Cogley, her focus remains the same: Removing the anxiety around her own sensory triggers, which include making eye contact.“Eye contact is a choice that I’ve made for myself, and I pushed myself to learn it, so that I could accomplish it” she said. “Not everybody needs to have eye contact, or push their limitations. But I wouldn’t be where I am today with my sensory issues, if I didn’t push myself ... to do things that were uncomfortable and caused anxiety.”"

Recipients of the photo confirmed its contents to HuffPost, which is not revealing their identities. The women, who are Bolling’s current and former Fox colleagues, concluded the message was from him because they recognized his number from previous work-related and informal interactions. The messages were sent several years ago, on separate occasions.The women did not solicit the messages, which they told colleagues were deeply upsetting and offensive. One of the recipients said that when she replied to Bolling via text, telling him never to send her such photos again, he did not respond. Four people, outside of the recipients, confirmed to HuffPost they’d seen the photo, and eight others said the recipients had spoken to them about it. For this story, HuffPost spoke to 14 sources in and out of Fox News and Fox Business, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity either because they currently work at the networks and aren’t allowed to speak to members of the press without prior authorization or because they have confidentiality agreements with Fox News and its parent company 21st Century Fox.Over the past year, the network has been rocked by multiple accusations of sexual harassment and assault by Fox News and Fox Business executives and on-air talent. Last year, former Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes resigned after former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson filed a lawsuit accusing him of sexual harassment. Since Ailes was forced out, multiple former and current Fox News hosts have accused him of harassment, including CNN anchor Alisyn Camerota. Last April, after a bombshell New York Times report revealed that Bill O’Reilly had quietly settled multiple sexual harassment suits, the network forced him out.Bolling, a former commodities trader, has worked at the Fox News and Fox Business networks since 2007, when he joined after leaving CNBC. He has had a history of making misogynistic on-air remarks during his tenure at Fox News, the most notable during a September 2014 segment on the panel show “The Five” while discussing the first woman fighter pilot from the United Arab Emirates leading the bombing of the Islamic State. Bolling asked on air if instead of saying “boots on the ground” it would be more appropriate to say “boobs on the ground.” He apologized the next day, citing “a look” he got from his wife when he arrived home.The allegations against Bolling recall statements he made attacking Anthony Weiner in 2014, after the former New York congressman had been embroiled in a scandal for sexting several women. During a Twitter war with Weiner, Bolling concluded with a tweet that said: “text us if you want a fair & balanced intv **NO SEFIES PLEASE [sic]**” In May 2017, when Weiner pleaded guilty to federal charges of exchanging lewd messages with an underage girl, Bolling said, “He is a sick human being, to continue to do this time and time again, continue to get caught, saying he’s not going to do it again, gets caught again.”Bolling serves as one of the co-hosts of “The Specialists,” a new program on the Fox News Channel. Previously, he served as one of the hosts of “The Five” and as a fill-in host for O’Reilly and Sean Hannity. After the network fired O’Reilly last April, Fox News announced that Bolling would leave the “The Five” and host another panel program at 5 p.m. with co-hosts Eboni Williams and Katherine Timpf. Bolling’s star at the Fox Networks has risen in the past two years, in part because of his close relationship with and strong support of President Donald Trump. Bolling can often be seen aggressively defending Trump on the network, and his loyalty has been repaid. Over the past few years, Trump has tweeted praise and support for Bolling at least a dozen times, including support for his book in 2016. When “The Specialists” premiered earlier this year, Bolling was granted an exclusive interview with Trump.Fox News recently renewed Bolling’s contract. In a statement in June, Fox News co-president Suzanne Scott said that Bolling’s “insight is valued, and we are pleased to have him at the network for many more years to come.”The multiyear extension ended speculation that he was going to accept a position in the Trump administration. In an interview with NJ.Com, Bolling said the Trump transition had floated the position of commerce secretary, but he said he would only consider joining as a senior adviser.In the interview, Bolling said he believed he had a future in politics: “When the lights go down on my TV career, the next step is running for Senate.” Follow Yashar — or send him a tip — on Twitter: @yashar"

And while it’s technically an anniversary, the engineers at the space agency programmed their cute little robot to sing the “Happy Birthday” song.And the results are, uh... a little depressing.NASA said that the rover has actually only hummed the song once before on its birthday in 2013, which is somehow even more sad. Despite being all alone, Curiosity has a great deal to celebrate.Thanks to the rover, we’ve gotten some magnificent photos of Mars never seen before. The NASA rover has also found methane and organic chemicals on the planet ― which could indicate that there was once life on Mars. The rover is likely to die alone on the planet.Anyway, happy birthday! "
41,POLITICS,New Sexual Harassment Allegations Leveled Against Fox News' Eric Bolling,Yashar Ali,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/eric-bolling-sexual-harassment-allegations_us_59865320e4b0cb15b1beebc6,The accusations came just hours after the network announced it had suspended Bolling.,2017-08-05,"Eric Bolling attends Fox News' ""The Five"" on Feb. 26, 2014, in New York City. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5986543615000021008b542c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Three hours after Fox News announced it had suspended host Eric Bolling following allegations that he had sexually harassed female colleagues, a former Fox News guest leveled new accusations against him. Caroline Heldman, who appeared on the network frequently between 2008 and 2011, said Saturday that Bolling was one of three Fox News/Fox Business employees to subject her to sexual harassment. Fox News announced Bolling’s suspension less than 24 hours after an exclusive HuffPost report revealed that the host had sent lewd text messages to female colleagues. “Eric Bolling has been suspended pending the results of an investigation, which is currently underway,” a Fox News spokesperson said in a statement to HuffPost. The network did not immediately return request for comment on the new allegations against Bolling. Bolling’s lawyer, Michael J. Bowe, did not immediately return a request for comment on Heldman’s accusations. But in response to HuffPost’s report about Bolling’s current and former colleagues accusing him of sending lewd photos, he said, “Mr. Bolling recalls no such inappropriate communications, does not believe he sent any such communications, and will vigorously pursue his legal remedies for any false and defamatory accusations that are made.”Heldman referred to Bolling’s suspension in a post on her Facebook page, which HuffPost has confirmed belongs to her. ”My only surprise is that it took this long for people to come forward about Bolling’s behavior, which has been wildly inappropriate for years,” she said. Heldman said she had also been subjected to sexual harassment by former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly and former Fox News consultant Woody Fraser. Mother Jones was first to report this week that Heldman, under the penalty of perjury, signed a declaration stating that Fraser offered her a paid Fox News contributor gig in exchange for sex. “I did hundreds of appearances on Fox and Fox Business from 2008 - 2011, and had multiple experiences with Bolling that caused grave concern to my friends and family. Bolling referred to me as ‘Dr. McHottie’ on air on four different occasions, and called me ‘smart, beautiful, and wrong’ on air twice,” Heldman wrote in her Facebook post. “Bolling would also contact me via phone and text after shows, sometimes to apologize for his behavior (and then do it again), and sometimes just to talk. He said he wanted to fly me out to New York for in-studio hits and to have ‘fun.’ He asked me to have meals with him on several occasions, but I found excuses not to go. Once, he took me up to his office in New York, showed me his baseball jerseys, and in the brief time I was there, let me know that his office was his favorite place to have sex,” she added. “I know other women have had similar experiences with Bolling, which means that lots of folks at Fox knew about his behavior well before 2017.”A Fox News source noted that Bolling’s office is entirely made up of glass and the view into it is unobstructed.Heldman also suggested in her Facebook post that the lawyers investigating the sexual harassment claims leveled against Bolling should speak to the makeup artists at Fox News. “Make-up artists at Fox are contract workers, so many are fearful of speaking up because they simply won’t be hired again,” Heldman said. “If any Fox executives are reading this, please include make-up artists in your assessment of the environment. They see and hear a lot, and are sometimes the target of harassment from hosts and guests.”In response to the new accusations against Bolling, a Fox News spokeswoman told HuffPost that, “We are investigating this matter and all claims will be taken into account.” Bolling is a co-host of “The Specialists,” a panel program that airs every weekday at 5 p.m. Eastern time. A source familiar with the matter told HuffPost that a rotating group of hosts will fill in for Bolling. Bolling also hosts “Cashin’ In,” a weekly business show that airs on Saturdays. The show normally tapes on Friday. According to a Fox News source, Bolling had taped this week’s episode before HuffPost approached the network with the accusations against him. The network pulled the episode and replaced it with half an hour of live news coverage.Follow Yashar — or send him a tip — on Twitter: @yashar"

While the spread of fentanyl contributed to a surge in overdose deaths in North America over the past few years, drug treatment organizations said it’s been largely unknown to the British public. “Drug-related deaths are increasing” in the U.K., said Dr. Prun Bijral of Change, Grow, Live, a nonprofit organization that focuses on substance abuse. “But if fentanyl comes, then we’re talking about a different league of problems.”Fentanyl, as well as its more potent analogues such as carfentanil, is often cut into heroin and sometimes other drugs such as cocaine. Its presence can make it harder to judge dosage and easier to overdose. Fatal overdoses related to synthetic opioids, including fentanyl, increased 73 percent in the United States last year, killing nearly 10,000 people. Canada is also struggling to address a surge in overdose deaths and an influx of fentanyl, with Minister of Health Jane Philpott calling the issue “arguably the greatest public health crisis we face.”Britain has also seen overdose deaths rise in recent years, but until late 2016 the National Crime Agency noted only a limited presence of fentanyl. How the drug is coming into Britain now and whether authorities have done enough to stop the influx remain unclear.“That’s one of the intelligence gaps,” National Crime Agency spokesman Lawrence Gibbons said. “We’ve had an impact, but how big or how significant that impact is yet to be measured.”It’s also uncertain just how much fentanyl is already in the U.K. drug supply. The new National Crime Agency report states that the number of potential fentanyl-related overdoses so far this year may increase as blood samples are back-tested.Addiction support services suggest that opioid users may be taking fentanyl without knowing it.“We’re not seeing people going out seeking fentanyl,” said Rick Bradley, manager at the U.K. drug and alcohol treatment charity Addaction. “What we’re seeing, in the last six to 12 months in particular, is that people are maybe using substances where fentanyl is being inadvertently used.”While the National Crime Agency report has drawn media coverage and public attention this week, addiction services and health workers said they’ve long been aware of the issue and looking for ways to prepare. Change, Grow, Live is considering offering drug testing specifically to determine when fentanyl is present, Bijral said, as well as working with government officials and other organizations to find a unified approach. Change, Grow, Live is also distributing kits with naloxone, a drug that can reverse opioid overdose. A 2015 U.K. law made naloxone available without a prescription for at-risk individuals, and over the past year Change, Grow, Live has handed out more than 13,000 kits. “Just like first aid is taught in schools and is universal, we’d like that to be the case with naloxone,” Bijral said.Officials at Change, Grow, Live and other aid organizations have also been looking at the way Canada is approaching the crisis, taking note of the various harm reduction and drug testing services the country has in place.One of Canada’s more controversial approaches is the safe injection site, which allows for supervised drug use, as well as testing and counseling services. The success of the sites in reducing overdose deaths has led Canada to approve more facilities in cities across the country. The U.K. last year approved its first supervised injection facility, in Glasgow. The center, which is not yet open, was established partially in response to a rise in the city’s HIV rate in 2015. Although Glasgow hasn’t seen fentanyl enter the local heroin supply yet, public health official Dr. Emilia Crighton said the center will help opioid users and could expand its services in the event of a fentanyl crisis.“People are more likely to die if they’re not engaged in services, so having effective addiction services is the most effective thing we can do for this group and help them recover,” Crighton said.The rise in fentanyl-linked deaths this year should be seen as an early warning, according to health officials. “We definitely need to be ready so that if it does get any worse, we’re prepared for that,” Bijral said. “That’s the opportunity we’ve got now while it’s at the stage it is. We’ve got to get everything ready just in case.” Jack Sommers contributed reporting from London."

This week the Mayor,2017-08-04,<p><em>China plans to build markets in Port</em>-<em>au</em>-<em>Prince under the new initiative. </em></p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5984a61915000084208b520a.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"China plans to invest $30 billion in Haiti’s infrastructure according to the Haitian Press Agency (AHP). This week the Mayor of Port-au-Prince, Youri Chevry, hosted the signing of an agreement between the Haitian company Bati Ayiti (Build Haiti), headed by former Senator Amos André, and the Southwest Municipal Engineering and Design Research Institute of China. The agreement includes the construction of a 600 megawatt power plant to electrify Port-au-Prince, the construction of a new City Hall, markets, thousands of apartments, and eventually a railway from Port-au-Prince to the countryside. The center of the discussion was ""the reconstruction of the main building of the Town Hall and the construction of several public contracts on the territory of the commune of Port-au-Prince,” according to LoopHaiti. 20,000 workers will begin work before the end of 2017, backed by an initial infusion of $5 billion. The Chinese Government has a deadline of September 30, 2017 to unblock the funds. In the meantime, Bati Ayiti, the City of Port-au-Prince and their partners continue to work on the recruitment of staff. Last May, China’s president Xi Jinping hosted the first Belt and Road Forum (“One Belt, One Road”) in Beijing, offering hundreds of billions of dollars to over 100 interested countries for infrastructure projects. Haiti stands to be a beneficiary of the ambitious Chinese initiative, which is modeled on the ancient “Silk Road.” 2,000 years ago China opened up routes of trade that linked the civilizations of Asia, Europe and Africa. China now stands to have influence in the Caribbean corridor stretching from Cuba to Venezuela.Some analysts have compared the One Belt One Road enterprise to the Marshall Plan. After World War II, the United States was such a strong manufacturing entity that it was forced to seek markets for its industrial products. The Marshall Plan required that aid to Europe involve a quid pro quo of U.S. investment and imports.Today, China has an excess amount of industrial capacity. China is exceptionally skilled at infrastructure. Foreign investment provides an outlet for exports of labor and resources. ""This accord may finally break the grip that the eternal exploiters of Haiti had for decades on the poor people of Haiti while they greatly benefited from favors and monopolies from corrupt governments,” says Bernard Sansaricq, the former Senate President of Haiti, in an email.Is it also possible that the Chinese initiative is less about altruistic globalization and more about finding markets for its industrial over capacity? Is China trying to lure Haiti into its geo-political orbit? Both motives may work together for the benefit of Haiti.It worked in Rwanda. Figures from the Rwanda Development Board indicate that Rwanda registered 45 Chinese investments from 2010 – 2016. The change in Kigali is stunning over the past 15 years. I have witnessed this transformation myself in multiple visits since 2004. The streets are clean and not a plastic bag in sight. A woman can walk the streets alone at midnight and feel as safe as on a moonlight stroll on Sanibel Island’s beaches.Chinese engineers built the country’s tallest building, Kigali City Tower, “a gleaming 20-story glass skyscraper; the building that houses Rwanda’s foreign ministry; various hotels, schools, and hospitals; and 80% of the country’s roads,” according to an article in Quartz Africa. There are still problems, of course, and outside development offers no guarantee of utopia. Competition for jobs remains fierce. As Ezili Danto of the Haitian Lawyers Leadership network suggests, China can capitalize on the failures of the Clinton Foundation failures in Haiti. “If Trump is too tied up with the Deep State and China leaves a bit of clean water, electricity, and road infrastructure- so be it. But anything done under the illegitimate (left-over Clinton/Bush establishment) government is worrisome. They put Jovenel (the current President) in to keep the status as is -- the people too hungry, sick, and weak to fight back,” Danto says.See also this article on the Haiti Mafioso. A power plant to light up the roads certainly won't be welcomed by the dark forces of the criminal mafias. “I'd have preferred to champion a U.S. government initiative, but it (the China investment) is what it is,” says Danto."

To fund that, the government has asked lawmakers to pass new revenue measures.Duterte’s economic program focuses on infrastructure spending and fiscal efficiency to lift growth to as much as 8 percent before his six-year term ends in 2022."

She is glowing, and from the viewpoint of the photograph, it looks as though her body has generally bounced back to its pre-pregnancy state. Many of us know a few mothers who have somehow just stepped back into their pre-pregnancy bodies. While I am happy for them, I cannot actually relate. And if you are reading this, then I suspect that you, dear postpartum mom, cannot either.For many of us who have given birth, our bodies have simply changed, never to revert again back to their old forms. Where it may have once been flat, there may be curves. What was once taut may now be soft and squishy. There might be lots of stretchmarks, indentations, plumpness and sagging. This is, frankly, the thing of nightmares for many of us; in fact, one survey found that 64 percent of mothers reported increased body image difficulties postpartum. It is the target of the famous “mommy makeover,” an expensive whole-body plastic surgery approach to undo many of these postpartum body changes. In short, women may feel the need to go to great lengths to prevent the oft-dreaded “mombod.” But for a moment, let’s consider that this does not have to be the case.For many of us who have wanted a baby for so long, the arrival of that baby can be a truly miraculous experience. We know that having a new baby typically means countless sleepless nights, struggles with breastfeeding, postpartum mood changes, strain on a marriage, and extraordinary expenses of having a child. Still, I’ll bet that if we discovered a time machine that would allow moms an opportunity to go back in time and avoid having that child, most moms would decline it. Why? Because despite the hardships associated with motherhood, the birth of a child is something to be celebrated.However, when a child is born, a mother (and a father) is also born. The mother shifts her identity, her roles on this earth, her views of herself, and her relationship to others. While this transition is often far more difficult than what she may have initially anticipated, the reality is that this new identity is an incredible and powerful one. And along with that emotional shift, there is also a physical one: the shift to a new, and quite beautiful, postpartum body.Many people feel societal pressures to have children. Incredibly and ironically, this very same society (and unfortunately, sometimes even our own partners, husbands, friends, or parents) views the typical postpartum body as an undesirable one. Such messages are sent to us repeatedly, which can result in our internalizing that message and accepting it as truth. Thus a postpartum mother might look at her new body and feel a deep sense of sadness, shame or even disgust. But the reality is that once a mother has given birth, her whole life – and her body – has taken on a new, incredible shape. This, I believe, is something to be celebrated and embraced.For these reasons, over the course of my work with hundreds of postpartum mothers, a major point of focus is often the unhappiness around the postpartum bodily changes. Mothers will frequently tend to become self-critical of their bodies. They love the bonding that they have while nursing, but then lament the changes in their breasts afterwards. Many admire their bodies for having expanded to accommodate a growing baby, but will then feel dissatisfied with the stretchmarks where their bellies grew. Some might even feel so worried about weight gain that they may consider restricting their caloric intake during pregnancy or postpartum to avoid it. We spend time validating their concerns, understanding and exploring why they may feel the way they do, and ultimately, finding ways to appreciate and love their new bodies.Fortunately, there seems to be a positive movement throughout society towards acceptance of one’s postpartum body changes. The Honest Body Project, for example, aims to demonstrate the beauty of real postpartum bodies through photography. Some mothers, many of whom are fed up with the societal pressures to regain their pre-pregnancy bodies, have bravely photographed and publicly shared their own postpartum bodily changes. And the work of Spanish artist Zinteta recently gained popularity once she started using artistic methods to teach women to embrace their new bodies. The changes in your postpartum life can feel completely overwhelming, and your new body might feel unrecognizable. However, as your settle into the new parts of your identity, it’s important to remember that body image issues can play a major role in your confidence and self-esteem. Acceptance of your postpartum body is a powerful step, one that can signify self-compassion as you embark on this incredible motherhood journey."

You may not think there’s a need for another gay film about a mother unaccepting of her son’s homosexuality . . . but apparently there is, especially if the mother and son are Taiwanese.Baby Steps, when released overseas, “energized [Taiwan’s] marriage equality debate,” according to production notes, and this year the island became “the first democracy in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage.” Additionally, the State Department screened the film at U.S. embassies in six cities in mainland China, including Beijing. Better dramedies have affected people’s lives and political futures far less.(When I first saw the film, the Trump administration hadn’t yet come out for disenfranchising the rights of transsexuals in the military and gays on the work force. Baby Steps is becoming more and more relevant by the second.)The plot here focuses on the openly gay Danny (Cheng), who’s blissfully settled in Los Angeles with his Ken-doll artist boyfriend Tate (Michael Adam Hamilton). The duo’s just celebrated an anniversary, in bed, when widowed Ma (Ah-Leh Gua) announces she will visit from Taiwan because she’s heard her son is going to father a child. “People say there are three major joys in life,” she notes. “First is getting married, second is giving birth, and third is holding a grandchild in your arms.”Of course, Ma believes her son’ll do the impregnation the old-fashioned way. Apparently, she’s not acquainted with the web site Surrogacy Now, the “#1 Egg Donor Database,” from which her grandchild will be hatched.Uh-oh! Besides not sharing that tidbit, Danny’s also not revealed that Tate is his partner, so all of the photos of the pair must be hidden along with other queer artifacts. Then his lover must be sent along to his own apartment before Ma arrives. Why? You’re already out, Danny. If you think finding her gay son without a beau will make Ma happy, you’re wrong. She doesn’t like the couch, the furniture placement in general, the populace of L.A., or sexual procreation where body parts don’t make actual physical contact.“Ma, I know it’s untraditional, but I don’t have a choice,” Danny explains. “I’m not gonna pretend or be with a woman just to have a baby.”The widowed Ma decides if this is the only way the family line will be carried forth, she’ll accept the process. Overcoming her distress, she gets involved in every aspect of the pregnancy . . . annoyingly so.From this point on, everything that can go wrong does go wrong in spades: sperm counts, unacceptable egg donors, insane surrogate mothers, anti-gay government laws, and so forth. But any viewer who can’t predict that the whole cast will be smiling and hugging as the end credits roll has never seen a queer romcom, or this film’s explicitly detailed trailer. So if you can overlook the soppy musical score, a doctor in a remarkably bad wig (the bald Jason Stewart) and an overacting security guard (Peter Dernbach), all the leads are affable and the politics on target. Inarguably, here’s an LGBT film created by and starring Asian-Americans that is seldom less than pleasant and definitely worth applauding. (BABY STEPS will be released in the U.S. and Canada via Gravitas Ventures on August 15th on DVD, Blu-ray, VOD and across digital platforms including iTunes, Amazon, and Google Play. There will be a Western Justice Center Benefit Screening on August 10th at the Downtown Independent Theater in Los Angeles.)"

Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) is an exceptionally upbeat dude, even by the serotonin-rich standards of professional politics.Luján, 45, oozes a corny, all-American wholesomeness, with boyish features set beneath a shiny woosh of a haircut ― it’s as if a “morning zoo” radio host ran for Congress. Luján’s “Hey, how ya doin’?” is dished out with exuberant regularity. He likes making “And how about ... ” call-outs praising his hard-working staff. His eyes have a tendency to bulge with excitement while he speaks, like a child beholding a ferocious animal at the zoo.Luján’s childlike enthusiasm serves him well as he enters his second two-year term as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), tasked with recruiting and supporting Democratic House candidates.“I know I’m not the smartest guy in the room,” Luján said with characteristic golly-gee-whiz earnestness during an interview with HuffPost late last month, “but I’ll listen, and I’ll learn and will execute.” Ben Ray Luján is a nice guy. The thing is, you might come to hate him very soon.Thanks to Donald Trump’s dysfunctional presidency, Democrats are in the strongest position to regain control of the lower chamber since 2006, when disgust over President George W. Bush’s mismanagement of Hurricane Katrina relief and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan sent the Republican House majority packing. However, the passions of the present moment make the 2006 election look like a sleepy race for town comptroller. In this stressful Trumpian period, the United States often feels like a nation of 320 million political strategists, with practically everyone proffering an opinion on how to refine the party’s message and direction: Go progressive. Go moderate. Shut up and let Trump sabotage himself.One thing is certain: For many in and around the party, a blue wave won’t do. Unless 2018 unleashes a political tsunami, a significant portion of the Democratic Party will likely be displeased with Luján’s leadership come Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2018. At the very least, Luján recognizes that it’s a hard job.“We have a big job to do across the country,” said Luján. “We have to go back and earn the trust of the American people where it was lost and in all parts of the country.”The DCCC clearly gets that it’s an opportunity. Its list of “flippable” Republican districts ― inclusion on which can make or break a House campaign’s fundraising efforts ― sports a whopping 80 districts, enough to flip the House three times over. It’s an aggressive list ― one, as Slate’s Jim Newell noted, has an average Cook Partisan Voting Index of just over R+7, which means an unnamed Republican candidate would enjoy a 7-point advantage over an unnamed Democrat in the district.The assessment that so many seats are up for grabs alone represents a massive attitude shift from the 2016 cycle, when Luján wasn’t even predicting a Democratic takeover of the House. “We have a unique opportunity to flip control of the House of Representatives in 2018,” Luján wrote in a June memo distributed to party officials and the press. “This is about much more than one race: The national environment, unprecedented grassroots energy and impressive Democratic candidates stepping up to run deep into the battlefield leave no doubt that Democrats can take back the House next fall.” While a changing of the guard a year from November is far from certain, Luján and the Democrats are certainly working with a robust class of candidates. Every DCCC chair has their own platonic ideal of a House candidate ― mayors, veterans, district attorneys, small-business owners and so forth. This cycle, Luján and the DCCC have settled, per Politico, on female veterans, ideally ones who run ― or have run ― a small business. At first blush, such a combination feels indulgent ― as backgrounds go, “veteran” plus anything is like the cronut of American politics. Such things are highly sought after and don’t necessarily grow on trees. While there are certainly untold numbers of Americans with very appealing stories ― like female veterans with small business experience ― candidates that check so many boxes don’t always choose to run in a meaningful number of districts.Yet female veteran candidates with notable non-military experience are already materializing ― a tribute to a motivated base and the efforts of grassroots organizations like Run for Something and VoteVets. There’s former Air Force engineer Chrissy Houlahan in Pennsylvania’s 6th Congressional District (she helped start a nonprofit), former Navy helicopter pilot Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey’s 11th District (a former federal prosecutor) and former Marine fighter pilot Amy McGrath in Kentucky’s 6th District (she graduated from the Center for the Study of Weapons of Mass Destruction’s Program for Emerging Leaders at the National Defense University, which is just a terrifyingly impressive sequence of words).“This year we’re fortunate that we have candidates of all backgrounds,” said Luján, drawing particular attention to the fact that here are “a lot of veterans, people who have served our country in different capacities.”Luján added that the DCCC was particularly interested in whether candidates had deep roots in their districts. “If they don’t trust you, they’re not ever going to put their faith in you,” he said. But not everything about the DCCC’s recruitment is going smoothly, to put it mildly. Just this week, The Hill published an interview with Luján in which he insisted that the candidates it supports aren’t subject to a “litmus test,” which includes their stance on hot-button issues like abortion rights. While those remarks jibed with the longstanding policy of both the DCCC and its Senate counterpart, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, it was the first time Luján was on the record saying as much.The remarks have prompted a skirmish in progressive circles. Many liberal activists, particularly ones focused on reproductive justice, viewed the continuation of the policy as a disappointment and a missed opportunity to capitalize on the groundswell of progressivism in the Trump era.“Throwing weight behind anti-choice candidates is bad politics that will lead to worse policy,” said Mitchell Stille, national campaigns director for the abortion rights advocacy organization NARAL Pro-Choice America, in a statement provided to HuffPost and other news outlets. “The idea that jettisoning this issue wins elections for Democrats is folly contradicted by all available data.”On Wednesday, NARAL President Ilyse Hogue and a coalition of progressive advocacy organizations, including Planned Parenthood Action Fund and EMILY’s List, published a “statement of principles” largely in response to the renewed debate over how ideological the DCCC should be. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), a strong supporter of reproductive rights, tweeted, “We do not have to make compromises on protecting women’s health to win back the House or Senate.”Democratic Party officials, who asked to speak anonymously so they could discuss private conversations, expressed frustration and surprise that the DCCC and DSCC were on the defensive over a long-standing policy. Exacerbating these feelings, the officials said, was the involvement of multiple activists whom the officials claimed had previously signaled their willingness to tolerate, if not endorse, anti-abortion Democrats.In conversations and in statements, DCCC officials have said that, while their organization plays a large role in candidate recruitment, their priority is to support whichever Democrat the primary voters choose.“This is not about impacting the roster of candidates as much as understanding what our mission and ultimate role and goal is,” said DCCC Communications Director Meredith Kelly. “As always, primary voters and local groups will ask candidates where they stand on the issues and select their own nominees. Our job is to get as many of those nominees elected to Congress as possible.”Officials anticipate that anti-abortion candidates will make up a negligible part of the Democrats’ crop of 2018 House candidates and that the organization’s approach isn’t about abandoning the Democratic principles as it’s adjusting to the political situation in certain districts. Dan Sena, the DCCC’s executive director, reiterated in an interview with HuffPost that there “absolutely is no litmus test” of a candidate’s agenda but insisted that policy aberrations are the exception, not the norm. “In Central Valley, California, where you are on water is more important than where you are on guns. In [California’s] Orange County, where you are on fiscal issues is going to matter more than social issues,” said Sena. “In Tucson, where you on on immigration and health care is probably more important than where you are on the environment. It’s really a balance of where we have certain types of profiles.” Regardless of where the Democratic House candidates end up on the ideological spectrum, the Republican Party is hoping to make the midterms a referendum on progressive policies, an argument it plans to take to districts where Trump outperformed expectations in the 2016 election. “Democrats have their heads buried in the sand, hoping to ignore the bitter primaries that are destined to tear their party apart in 2018,” said the National Republican Congressional Committee’s spokesman Jesse Hunt. “It’s going to be a race to the left, with single-payer health care as the ultimate litmus test.”Luján’s own remarks fit with a broader push by the party to focus on less politically charged economic issues, such as job creation, combating corporate malfeasance and retirement security. That approach, he said, can unite moderate and progressive Democrats.“I think what’s most important this cycle ― and every cycle after this ― is that Democratic elected leaders and our party leadership don’t ever forget the importance of standing up and fighting for hard-working families across the country, especially when it comes to economic issues,” Luján said. “It turns out that whether you live in the smallest community in rural America or if you live in one of the biggest cities in the United States, we all understand the importance of a job [and] the dignity of the paycheck.”Another issue causing consternation among Democratic activists is the DCCC’s digital fundraising program. DCCC officials take pride in their fundraising efforts, saying a majority of their 2017 fundraising to date comes from small-dollar donors. The DCCC out-raised its Republican counterpart for the second quarter of 2017 by $5 million ($29.1 million compared with $24.1 million). However, many observers both within the party and without have criticized the way that those dollars are solicited. There’s a good chance that more people can describe the DCCC by the content of its fundraising appeals than by the organization’s actual function in the Democratic Party. You may have seen some of their emails in your inbox: From: Nancy PelosiSuch alarmist clickbait is a great way to increase email open rates ― if House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is depressed and wants to chat, who are you to ignore her? ― but many Democrats worry that such hair-on-fire tactics will degrade the Democrats’ brand and create a cry-wolf effect. The FINAL-NOTICE email contained decidedly scammy language and formatting about the recipient risking losing their party membership if they didn’t act. The blast from political strategist James Carville, despite its subject, was actually sent a week and a half before the 2016 election. Though manipulative fundraising tactics may pale in significance compared with the policy debates underway, the emotions they solicit from party and liberal activists are no less raw. The DCCC, one former Democratic official warned, should seriously weigh the “short-term gains of more $3 donations from scared white ladies who see subject lines like ‘doomed’” against long-term party building. Luján and DCCC officials say they understand criticism of the email campaigns, but to crudely summarize their views on the matter: the emails are too damn profitable to stop.Luján says that there’s been “a shift in tone already this cycle,” something he attributes to listening to activists across the country. However, he maintains that such behavior is necessary in a dog-eat-dog, post-Citizens United fundraising environment.“Half of what we’ve raised thus far to date has come from that program,” Luján observed. “I recognize the reputations thing,” echoed Sena, who said such criticisms “do not fall on deaf ears,” but pointed to the digital program’s financial success. “People are responding to it and joining the fight. They’re doing that by giving.”One area where the DCCC is changing course is its geographical focus, a correction that party officials admit was long overdue. It has relocated a number of D.C. staff positions to permanent posts in the districts and recruited a number of local organizers whose job, says Sena, is to “arm the rebels.”“I think all too often there was always an emphasis on training as many people as you could in Washington, D.C., and then you’d fly them into different races across America, and after that election cycle they’d all pack up and go back to Washington, D.C.,” Luján recalled.“It’s a matter of being present, of going and having conversations with people,” he elaborated. “I think what we’ve seen in the past is people have made mistakes with a tendency to speak down to people.”The DCCC is also hosting a number of “DCCC University” sessions, in which its staffers and local political activists train up-and-coming campaign officials in behind-the-scenes skills, such as press engagement, coalition building and get-out-the-vote initiatives.It was at one of these events in Albuquerque last month that Luján sat down with HuffPost.“Everyone’s here for a fun-filled information gathering!” a typically revved-up Luján told the crowd before the training.The congressman’s blandly hip outfit that day ― jeans and a blazer over a T-shirt stamped with the New Mexico flag ― served to strengthen his nice guy vibes. In an alternate life, you could see him as a youth pastor who regularly sits backward on chairs to “rap” with kids about abstinence.For Luján, such organizationally minded events are an increasingly central component of the DCCC’s work, as its financial reach, though still large, is diluted by all the independent expenditures now in play in a post-Citizens United world.“What we’re seeing after Citizens United are Republicans having endless amounts of money to attack and attack and attack, so you have to be in a position to defend that,” Luján said. “I think it’s fair to say that, with the candidates that I’ve been working with, I have put an emphasis on making sure that you’re building a strong campaign and program.”Yet the interview came on the heels of stinging Democratic losses in special elections for House seats in Georgia, Montana, South Carolina and Kansas. The DCCC has absorbed considerable criticism over the loss in Georgia’s 6th Congressional District, where many saw Democratic nominee Jon Ossoff as overly cautious when it came to criticizing Trump and thought he ran a campaign that was “overly focus-grouped,” as Jeff Hauser, a House campaign veteran and executive director of the Revolving Door Project at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, described it.“There definitely needs to be a message about what a Democratic Congress would do but also how Trump is making Washington worse,” Hauser said.Luján says he is proud of the campaign Ossoff ran, and, though he resisted providing a postmortem, he did say that the various scandals enveloping the Trump administration should be a part of Democrats’ messaging going forward.“Could we have made better decisions about leaning in [to the special elections] earlier or later?” asked Luján rhetorically. “I think those are all fair questions, and we are getting to the bottom of that.“I see incredible momentum coming out of these special elections.

52,POLITICS,Democrats Could Take Back The House.

Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) is an exceptionally upbeat dude, even by the serotonin-rich standards of professional politics.Luján, 45, oozes a corny, all-American wholesomeness, with boyish features set beneath a shiny woosh of a haircut ― it’s as if a “morning zoo” radio host ran for Congress. Luján’s “Hey, how ya doin’?” is dished out with exuberant regularity. He likes making “And how about ... ” call-outs praising his hard-working staff. His eyes have a tendency to bulge with excitement while he speaks, like a child beholding a ferocious animal at the zoo.Luján’s childlike enthusiasm serves him well as he enters his second two-year term as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), tasked with recruiting and supporting Democratic House candidates.“I know I’m not the smartest guy in the room,” Luján said with characteristic golly-gee-whiz earnestness during an interview with HuffPost late last month, “but I’ll listen, and I’ll learn and will execute.” Ben Ray Luján is a nice guy. The thing is, you might come to hate him very soon.Thanks to Donald Trump’s dysfunctional presidency, Democrats are in the strongest position to regain control of the lower chamber since 2006, when disgust over President George W. Bush’s mismanagement of Hurricane Katrina relief and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan sent the Republican House majority packing. However, the passions of the present moment make the 2006 election look like a sleepy race for town comptroller. In this stressful Trumpian period, the United States often feels like a nation of 320 million political strategists, with practically everyone proffering an opinion on how to refine the party’s message and direction: Go progressive. Go moderate. Shut up and let Trump sabotage himself.One thing is certain: For many in and around the party, a blue wave won’t do. Unless 2018 unleashes a political tsunami, a significant portion of the Democratic Party will likely be displeased with Luján’s leadership come Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2018. At the very least, Luján recognizes that it’s a hard job.“We have a big job to do across the country,” said Luján. “We have to go back and earn the trust of the American people where it was lost and in all parts of the country.”The DCCC clearly gets that it’s an opportunity. Its list of “flippable” Republican districts ― inclusion on which can make or break a House campaign’s fundraising efforts ― sports a whopping 80 districts, enough to flip the House three times over. It’s an aggressive list ― one, as Slate’s Jim Newell noted, has an average Cook Partisan Voting Index of just over R+7, which means an unnamed Republican candidate would enjoy a 7-point advantage over an unnamed Democrat in the district.The assessment that so many seats are up for grabs alone represents a massive attitude shift from the 2016 cycle, when Luján wasn’t even predicting a Democratic takeover of the House. “We have a unique opportunity to flip control of the House of Representatives in 2018,” Luján wrote in a June memo distributed to party officials and the press. “This is about much more than one race: The national environment, unprecedented grassroots energy and impressive Democratic candidates stepping up to run deep into the battlefield leave no doubt that Democrats can take back the House next fall.” While a changing of the guard a year from November is far from certain, Luján and the Democrats are certainly working with a robust class of candidates. Every DCCC chair has their own platonic ideal of a House candidate ― mayors, veterans, district attorneys, small-business owners and so forth. This cycle, Luján and the DCCC have settled, per Politico, on female veterans, ideally ones who run ― or have run ― a small business. At first blush, such a combination feels indulgent ― as backgrounds go, “veteran” plus anything is like the cronut of American politics. Such things are highly sought after and don’t necessarily grow on trees. While there are certainly untold numbers of Americans with very appealing stories ― like female veterans with small business experience ― candidates that check so many boxes don’t always choose to run in a meaningful number of districts.Yet female veteran candidates with notable non-military experience are already materializing ― a tribute to a motivated base and the efforts of grassroots organizations like Run for Something and VoteVets. There’s former Air Force engineer Chrissy Houlahan in Pennsylvania’s 6th Congressional District (she helped start a nonprofit), former Navy helicopter pilot Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey’s 11th District (a former federal prosecutor) and former Marine fighter pilot Amy McGrath in Kentucky’s 6th District (she graduated from the Center for the Study of Weapons of Mass Destruction’s Program for Emerging Leaders at the National Defense University, which is just a terrifyingly impressive sequence of words).“This year we’re fortunate that we have candidates of all backgrounds,” said Luján, drawing particular attention to the fact that here are “a lot of veterans, people who have served our country in different capacities.”Luján added that the DCCC was particularly interested in whether candidates had deep roots in their districts. “If they don’t trust you, they’re not ever going to put their faith in you,” he said. But not everything about the DCCC’s recruitment is going smoothly, to put it mildly. Just this week, The Hill published an interview with Luján in which he insisted that the candidates it supports aren’t subject to a “litmus test,” which includes their stance on hot-button issues like abortion rights. While those remarks jibed with the longstanding policy of both the DCCC and its Senate counterpart, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, it was the first time Luján was on the record saying as much.The remarks have prompted a skirmish in progressive circles. Many liberal activists, particularly ones focused on reproductive justice, viewed the continuation of the policy as a disappointment and a missed opportunity to capitalize on the groundswell of progressivism in the Trump era.“Throwing weight behind anti-choice candidates is bad politics that will lead to worse policy,” said Mitchell Stille, national campaigns director for the abortion rights advocacy organization NARAL Pro-Choice America, in a statement provided to HuffPost and other news outlets. “The idea that jettisoning this issue wins elections for Democrats is folly contradicted by all available data.”On Wednesday, NARAL President Ilyse Hogue and a coalition of progressive advocacy organizations, including Planned Parenthood Action Fund and EMILY’s List, published a “statement of principles” largely in response to the renewed debate over how ideological the DCCC should be. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), a strong supporter of reproductive rights, tweeted, “We do not have to make compromises on protecting women’s health to win back the House or Senate.”Democratic Party officials, who asked to speak anonymously so they could discuss private conversations, expressed frustration and surprise that the DCCC and DSCC were on the defensive over a long-standing policy. Exacerbating these feelings, the officials said, was the involvement of multiple activists whom the officials claimed had previously signaled their willingness to tolerate, if not endorse, anti-abortion Democrats.In conversations and in statements, DCCC officials have said that, while their organization plays a large role in candidate recruitment, their priority is to support whichever Democrat the primary voters choose.“This is not about impacting the roster of candidates as much as understanding what our mission and ultimate role and goal is,” said DCCC Communications Director Meredith Kelly. “As always, primary voters and local groups will ask candidates where they stand on the issues and select their own nominees. Our job is to get as many of those nominees elected to Congress as possible.”Officials anticipate that anti-abortion candidates will make up a negligible part of the Democrats’ crop of 2018 House candidates and that the organization’s approach isn’t about abandoning the Democratic principles as it’s adjusting to the political situation in certain districts. Dan Sena, the DCCC’s executive director, reiterated in an interview with HuffPost that there “absolutely is no litmus test” of a candidate’s agenda but insisted that policy aberrations are the exception, not the norm. “In Central Valley, California, where you are on water is more important than where you are on guns. In [California’s] Orange County, where you are on fiscal issues is going to matter more than social issues,” said Sena. “In Tucson, where you on on immigration and health care is probably more important than where you are on the environment. It’s really a balance of where we have certain types of profiles.” Regardless of where the Democratic House candidates end up on the ideological spectrum, the Republican Party is hoping to make the midterms a referendum on progressive policies, an argument it plans to take to districts where Trump outperformed expectations in the 2016 election. “Democrats have their heads buried in the sand, hoping to ignore the bitter primaries that are destined to tear their party apart in 2018,” said the National Republican Congressional Committee’s spokesman Jesse Hunt. “It’s going to be a race to the left, with single-payer health care as the ultimate litmus test.”Luján’s own remarks fit with a broader push by the party to focus on less politically charged economic issues, such as job creation, combating corporate malfeasance and retirement security. That approach, he said, can unite moderate and progressive Democrats.“I think what’s most important this cycle ― and every cycle after this ― is that Democratic elected leaders and our party leadership don’t ever forget the importance of standing up and fighting for hard-working families across the country, especially when it comes to economic issues,” Luján said. “It turns out that whether you live in the smallest community in rural America or if you live in one of the biggest cities in the United States, we all understand the importance of a job [and] the dignity of the paycheck.”Another issue causing consternation among Democratic activists is the DCCC’s digital fundraising program. DCCC officials take pride in their fundraising efforts, saying a majority of their 2017 fundraising to date comes from small-dollar donors. The DCCC out-raised its Republican counterpart for the second quarter of 2017 by $5 million ($29.1 million compared with $24.1 million). However, many observers both within the party and without have criticized the way that those dollars are solicited. There’s a good chance that more people can describe the DCCC by the content of its fundraising appeals than by the organization’s actual function in the Democratic Party. You may have seen some of their emails in your inbox: From: Nancy PelosiSuch alarmist clickbait is a great way to increase email open rates ― if House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is depressed and wants to chat, who are you to ignore her? ― but many Democrats worry that such hair-on-fire tactics will degrade the Democrats’ brand and create a cry-wolf effect. The FINAL-NOTICE email contained decidedly scammy language and formatting about the recipient risking losing their party membership if they didn’t act. The blast from political strategist James Carville, despite its subject, was actually sent a week and a half before the 2016 election. Though manipulative fundraising tactics may pale in significance compared with the policy debates underway, the emotions they solicit from party and liberal activists are no less raw. The DCCC, one former Democratic official warned, should seriously weigh the “short-term gains of more $3 donations from scared white ladies who see subject lines like ‘doomed’” against long-term party building. Luján and DCCC officials say they understand criticism of the email campaigns, but to crudely summarize their views on the matter: the emails are too damn profitable to stop.Luján says that there’s been “a shift in tone already this cycle,” something he attributes to listening to activists across the country. However, he maintains that such behavior is necessary in a dog-eat-dog, post-Citizens United fundraising environment.“Half of what we’ve raised thus far to date has come from that program,” Luján observed. “I recognize the reputations thing,” echoed Sena, who said such criticisms “do not fall on deaf ears,” but pointed to the digital program’s financial success. “People are responding to it and joining the fight. They’re doing that by giving.”One area where the DCCC is changing course is its geographical focus, a correction that party officials admit was long overdue. It has relocated a number of D.C. staff positions to permanent posts in the districts and recruited a number of local organizers whose job, says Sena, is to “arm the rebels.”“I think all too often there was always an emphasis on training as many people as you could in Washington, D.C., and then you’d fly them into different races across America, and after that election cycle they’d all pack up and go back to Washington, D.C.,” Luján recalled.“It’s a matter of being present, of going and having conversations with people,” he elaborated. “I think what we’ve seen in the past is people have made mistakes with a tendency to speak down to people.”The DCCC is also hosting a number of “DCCC University” sessions, in which its staffers and local political activists train up-and-coming campaign officials in behind-the-scenes skills, such as press engagement, coalition building and get-out-the-vote initiatives.It was at one of these events in Albuquerque last month that Luján sat down with HuffPost.“Everyone’s here for a fun-filled information gathering!” a typically revved-up Luján told the crowd before the training.The congressman’s blandly hip outfit that day ― jeans and a blazer over a T-shirt stamped with the New Mexico flag ― served to strengthen his nice guy vibes. In an alternate life, you could see him as a youth pastor who regularly sits backward on chairs to “rap” with kids about abstinence.For Luján, such organizationally minded events are an increasingly central component of the DCCC’s work, as its financial reach, though still large, is diluted by all the independent expenditures now in play in a post-Citizens United world.“What we’re seeing after Citizens United are Republicans having endless amounts of money to attack and attack and attack, so you have to be in a position to defend that,” Luján said. “I think it’s fair to say that, with the candidates that I’ve been working with, I have put an emphasis on making sure that you’re building a strong campaign and program.”Yet the interview came on the heels of stinging Democratic losses in special elections for House seats in Georgia, Montana, South Carolina and Kansas. The DCCC has absorbed considerable criticism over the loss in Georgia’s 6th Congressional District, where many saw Democratic nominee Jon Ossoff as overly cautious when it came to criticizing Trump and thought he ran a campaign that was “overly focus-grouped,” as Jeff Hauser, a House campaign veteran and executive director of the Revolving Door Project at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, described it.“There definitely needs to be a message about what a Democratic Congress would do but also how Trump is making Washington worse,” Hauser said.Luján says he is proud of the campaign Ossoff ran, and, though he resisted providing a postmortem, he did say that the various scandals enveloping the Trump administration should be a part of Democrats’ messaging going forward.“Could we have made better decisions about leaning in [to the special elections] earlier or later?” asked Luján rhetorically. “I think those are all fair questions, and we are getting to the bottom of that.“I see incredible momentum coming out of these special elections. That the National Republican Campaign Committee and the Congressional Leadership Fund had to spend the dollars that they did should worry them.”But Luján said he doesn’t want Democrats to get “distracted” by Trump: “We have to keep our focus on the American people and focus on what we can do to make things better.”The DCCC often serves as a stepping stone to party leadership, and a big win on Nov. 6, 2018, could be Luján’s ticket to replacing Pelosi or one of her top deputies, all of whom are in their late 70s. It’s talk that DCCC officials notably don’t dissuade, and with a number of Luján’s potential rivals for those top jobs seeking opportunities elsewhere, there’s a good chance that America will become much more familiar with Luján in the years to come.The renewed debate over how policy-focused the DCCC should be is just a taste of what Luján could expect should he rise to higher ranks.

The mom wrote in the caption:“Here’s me nursing my 19 month old son at Ironman Village this weekend. This was my first full Ironman ― 140.6 miles! I was nervous about nursing/pumping and worried about how my pump would get to and from the two transitions without me getting disqualified from taking something from my husband. I talked with IM staff and they were amazing! Not only did they help me find a solution, but they were supportive and even took responsibility for my pump and brought it from T1 to T2 and made sure it was in my run gear bag for when I arrived!”The post received more than 6,000 likes. The competition, which took place on Saturday, was Bolduc’s first full Ironman after competing in a half Ironman in May and several other triathlons, bike races and running events over the years.Bolduc told HuffPost she was happy to learn that Ironman as a company supports breastfeeding athletes and employees. Race staff brought the mom her pump so that she could express milk in the two transition times between the swimming, biking and running events.Her main goals were 1) to pump enough to allow her to race comfortably and 2) to finish in under 15 hours, Even with the extra minutes added for her pumping, her official time was 14:57:03. Bolduc decided to share her story to empower other women. “I think our society tends to shame women, and especially moms for pretty much everything,” she told HuffPost. “I am a breastfeeding advocate, mat and aerial yoga instructor, athlete, and labor doula. I believe that it is very important for me to practice what I preach and to promote evidence-based information.”She added that breastfeeding is a huge part of her life and she plans to follow the World Health Organization’s recommendation that babies drink breast milk until they are at least 2 years old. As a breastfeeding advocate, Bolduc tries to focus on the empowering parts of breastfeeding. “I have heard and seen, and experienced my fair share of rude and derogatory comments, hurtful messages, looks and attacks on breastfeeding women, and it is absolutely appealing, and so incredibly disappointing,” she said. “I wanted to share that it is possible to be an athlete, mother, breastfeeding, and still following your dreams.”“I was inspired to share with everyone that despite what onlookers say, despite how you may or may not be treated, you should always do what you think is best for you and your family. You will be incredibly surprised by the kindness, generosity, support, and empowerment you receive from other individuals, companies, places, and experiences.”Ultimately, Bolduc encourages mothers to focus on doing whatever is best for them and their families ― and focus on the kindness and support they receive from others ― not the negativity. “I always tell my doula client, ‘You do uterus,’ and I mean that! I want women everywhere to be true to themselves and to their families. I want mothers to be what is best for their families and not worry about what kind of backlash they will get.”Although Bolduc has received mostly positive feedback to her story, she told HuffPost she’s also gotten her fair share of unkind and hurtful comments and messages. She chooses not to respond to them and encourages others to do the same. Instead, Bolduc urges people to build each other up and support mothers everywhere. “There has been an outpouring of love, support, encouragement, empowerment, and motherhood ― and it is absolutely beautiful,” she said. “We are building bridges, providing education, and making a difference for mothers, athletes, and breastfeeding women to come, and it is truly an honor to be a part of it all.”"

Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) is defending her decision to keep an information technology aide on her staff for six months after she was informed he was under investigation for fraud.“I believe that I did the right thing, and I would do it again,” Wasserman Schultz told the Sun Sentinel on Thursday. “There are times when you can’t be afraid to stand alone, and you have to stand up for what’s right.”In February, Imran Awan was banned from using the House computer system and fired by multiple members of Congress following revelations that he was under investigation for “procurement violations and data transfer violations.”Wasserman Schultz was the only lawmaker at the time to not terminate him, claiming she was concerned about “racial and ethnic profiling” directed at her aide, who is Muslim and is a naturalized American citizen from Pakistan.“I had grave concerns about his due process rights being violated,” Wasserman Schultz said. “When their investigation was reviewed with me, I was presented with no evidence of anything that they were being investigated for.”Wasserman Schultz did fire Awan last week after he was arrested on bank fraud charges at Dulles International Airport near Washington, D.C., as he prepared to travel to Pakistan.Awan, who had worked for the congresswoman since 2005, and his wife had illegally claimed a rental property was a “principal residence” to secure a home equity line of credit, according to an FBI affidavit. Wasserman Schultz told the Sun Sentinel that there’s no evidence that’s he done anything wrong involving his work for Congress. The Florida Democrat dismissed right-wing conspiracy theories that Awan was attempting to “flee” the country when he was arrested, pointing to the unpaid leave of absence forms he filled out with her chief of staff before he left. Awan had purchased a return ticket to the U.S. for January, reported The Tampa Bay Times. “He is from Pakistan,” Wasserman Schultz told the Sun Sentinel. “He’s an American, a naturalized American citizen. His children are natural born citizens. His wife is a naturalized American citizen. And I mean when you’re trying to flee, you don’t fill out a form with your employer and go on unpaid leave.”Awan pleaded not guilty last week and was released on the condition that he wear a GPS monitor and stay within a 50-mile radius of his home, according to The Tampa Bay Times. A preliminary hearing was scheduled for Aug. 21.Awan’s arrest is the latest controversy to plague Wasserman Schultz, who resigned as Democratic National Committee chair in July 2016 after then-presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and his supporters accused her of rigging the Democratic primaries against him.Read the full interview on the Sun Sentinel."

The Alabama chapter of the national Council on American-Islamic Relations is claiming that the bacon was intentionally inserted into the family’s food at a restaurant in Decatur, Alabama, on Monday.CAIR-Alabama’s executive director, Khaula Hadeed, is calling on McDonald’s to investigate further and fire any employees found responsible.“Based on the evidence in this incident, as well as the unprecedented spike in anti-Muslim bigotry nationwide, we believe this was an intentional act of religious and ethnic bigotry,” Hadeed said in a statement. “McDonald’s should investigate this incident, identify and terminate the employees responsible, and take proactive steps to satisfy this American family’s concerns, starting with an apology.”The family of seven consisted of three women, all wearing Islamic headscarves, and four children under ten. After visiting a nearby water park, they stopped by a McDonald’s on Point Mallard Parkway and ordered 14 McChicken sandwiches. As they were eating, they started noticing a strange, “smoky” taste that was unfamiliar to them. “One of the kids opened one of the sandwiches and it had bacon it ― like a very small, chunk of bacon in there. They were really surprised and kind of horrified,” Hadeed told HuffPost. “They opened all of them and, lo and behold, all of them had a small of chunk of crudely torn bacon piece in them ― either underneath the patty or on top of it in a way where you wouldn’t see it.”Islamic dietary laws discourage Muslims from eating pork, or pork by-products. A similar prohibition also exists in Judaism. The family went up to the counter and asked the staff at the restaurant for an explanation. Hadeed said that one employee suggested that the bacon had fallen into the sandwiches. She found that unconvincing, since the bacon was apparently torn up. “The employee in the restaurant initially explained that the bacon ended up on all those sandwiches because the bacon somehow fell off the shelves, which is silly and beyond the pale. Even without that comment, the fact that tiny pieces of bacon, just small enough to avoid easy detection, ended up in all 14 sandwiches that would not normally have bacon is evidence enough of purposeful intent,” she said. One adult in the family apparently vomited twice after eating the bacon. CAIR uploaded a video of the sandwiches to its YouTube channel. It appears to be shot by a member of the Muslim family using Snapchat.HuffPost reached out to McDonald’s corporate office for comment. It passed along a statement from the representative of the local Decatur restaurant. “We want to assure our customers that this was not an intentional act by our employees,” the statement read. “We value every customer and strive to ensure all orders are accurately prepared and served. We are looking into the matter to understand what happened.” The operations manager for the local McDonalds restaurant did not return HuffPost’s requests for comment.The manager ended up giving the family a refund, Hadeed said.But Hadeed emphasized that this was about more than the bacon ― it was about the “maliciousness and cruelty” of the act. She said the family feels targeted specifically because of their faith. The incident comes amid a spike in anti-Muslim hate crimes and bias incidents. CAIR says it documented a 44 percent rise in anti-Muslim hate crimes during 2016. In the past, vandals have used pig and pork products to express resentment towards Muslims and their worship spaces.Against that backdrop, Hadeed said that knowingly serving pork to a Muslim is “symbolic of a grave expression of hate and a robust emotional assault.”""[This was] an act of intimidation, extremely harsh, and undeserved,"" she said. ""There is no other way to look at it. The message being sent to the family was, you are unwelcome and your way of life is unacceptable.”Hayley Miller contributed to this report.

58,HEALTHY LIVING,What The Washington Post Gets Wrong About Opioids,"Lloyd I. Sederer, MD, ContributorChief Medical Officer, New York State Office of Mental Health",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opioids-the-washington-post-and-the-trump-commission_us_5984d86ae4b0f2c7d93f55a6,The paper gets its history wrong.,2017-08-04,<p>Improving Mental Health: 4 Secrets in Plain Sight</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5984d8af2200001d001a48d7.jpg?ops=crop_0_3_176_241%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"On July 31, 2017, the usually very well-informed Washington Post published a blog titled “Opioid Abuse started as a rural epidemic. It’s now a national one.” The Post cited a national survey on drug use in the US, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine. That survey demonstrated the gravity of the opioid epidemic, in that 11 million people reported misusing opioids and 1.9 million said they were addicted.Moreover, 38 percent of adults in this country (2015) were prescribed an opioid – which is the most common path to opioid pill addiction and its progression to heroin – with heroin now being cut with the deadly Fentanyl, 50-100 times more potent than morphine.I thank the Post for its reporting on this epidemic, but it needs to get its history right, in two ways.First, the opioid (and related psychoactive drugs) epidemic did not begin in rural areas, though they seem to have gathered the most media attention in recent years. I too read Hillbilly Elegy and saw the great film, Winter’s Bone. But what we have witnessed as of late is the attention gained when middle and working-class, white Americans are afflicted. Opioid addiction, principally heroin, has been around for over 100 years among poor people of color generally clustered in large cities (where the drug could be obtained in the past, and crime pursued to pay for the habit).Second, the Post did not crack its American history books about opioids. At the onset of the 1800s, nearly two hundred years ago, opioids were readily available and used commonly in patent medications by medical prescription, in two forms: laudanum, which contained alcohol, and “black drop,” which did not. No surprise, these drugs delivered soothing effects and were effective relief for many human ails, including pain as well as gastrointestinal and emotional disorders. Opioids also were considered to have limited potential for abuse and dependence (sounds terribly familiar to the prescription pain pills promoted by the pharmaceutical industry and widely prescribed by doctors in America, starting in the mid-1990s).The mid-nineteenth century saw the invention of the “hypodermic” (literally, below the skin) needle, the syringe nowadays. The first (recorded) opioid overdose occurred shortly after that. But it was the Civil War that gave great impetus to the use of opioids, because it was used with many soldiers who became dependent and continued to use after the war (called Soldier’s Disease). What goes around: The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have produced their share of Soldier’s Disease in this country today. And neither war-driven epidemic began in rural America.The late 1800s saw the building of this country’s railroads, with Chinese laborers doing the work, and sustaining themselves on opium. In 1888, Bayer Pharmaceuticals, a German company, synthesized heroin. It was used in this country as a cough syrup and for treating menstrual pain. By 1900, there were an estimated ¼ million Americans dependent on heroin (John A Renner, Opioid Dependence in America, in Handbook of Office-based Buprenorphine Treatment of Opioid Dependence, by Petros Levounis, John Renner, etal, Am. Psychiatric Assn Publishing, 2011, p1).The 20th century is ripe with history of opioid use, abuse and all shades of medical, cultural and legal policies and procedures. My book, The Addiction Solution: Solving America’s Drug Crisis (Scribner, 2018), goes into detail on these matters. Suffice it to say, the Post seems to have not looked back and saw the extensive, non-rural, story about opioids in this country.But, any discussion of the opioid epidemic must touch on the Trump Presidential “Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis”, which began in March of this year led by the nation’s most disfavored Governor, Chris Christie (Governing Magazine). July 31, 2017, saw an “interim” report released. According to this report, 142 Americans a day now die from drug overdoses, principally opioids. So, 142 x 120 days (the making of this report), which will not be done until October, means approximately 17,000 Americans have died so far in this epidemic; over 12,000 more will die while we await the final Commission Report.There are two prominent and tragic aspects of this Commission’s activities, such as they are. First, is that there is nothing new in this report that was not very well covered, with problems defined, as well as how to remediate them, in the former Surgeon General’s (Dr. Vivek Murthy) November 2016 policy paper on drugs in America. In other words, it will be about a year (or near to 52,000 lives lost) awaiting a final report with nothing new to add. Second, the recommendations fail to recognize that the principal funding for substance use disorder treatments is not, can never be, from Congressional appropriations. It is from Medicaid. And of course, the Republican White House and Congress are dead set on taking 22 million people off Medicaid, and making health and mental health care unaffordable for countless others in need.Indeed, we have profound addiction problem, as well as unemployment, poverty and a dubious future of opportunity, in rural America. But that is not where the opioid epidemic in this country began. And it is not only where we need to focus our attention.………..Dr. Lloyd Sederer is a psychiatrist and public health doctor.

The space, founded in 1983 by Florence Ludins-Katz and Elias Katz, encourages artists struggling with physical and mental conditions to hone a daily artistic practice and pursue careers as profitable visual artists. “Some people think they are like children,” Auerbach continued. “The artists here aren’t. They have adult concepts and this is one of them.”Every couple of months, Creativity Explored puts on a new thematic exhibition featuring work from some of the approximately 130 artists in their roster. The current exhibition, “Exposed,” revolves around nudity, sexuality and the human body. While the female nude has been a recurring image throughout art history, the Creativity Explored artists offer unorthodox imaginings of the human body, which is privileged not for its adherence to Western beauty ideals but for its smells, flavors, mysteries and desires. The show features work by six artists, men and women, working in drawing, painting and sculpture. For some artists, like 36-year-old Antonio Benjamin, the naked human body isn’t necessarily equated with sex. Benjamin draws boxy bodies like paper dolls, which he describes as chocolate, vanilla and strawberry, all existing in what he dubs a Neapolitan world.“When I’m drawing a naked body, it’s not sexual,” Benjamin told his visual arts instructor Judith LaRosa. “Mmm! Not about sex!” When LaRosa asked, in response, if the drawings were about what’s natural, Benjamin responded with an enthusiastic “yes.”“Sometimes I like to draw people that look like me,” he added. “Brown like me.”For other artists, however, the works do possess a certain erotic power. Like, for example, Camille Holvoet, whose pastel depictions of sugary treats and naked bodies bubble over with feeling of mouthwatering hunger. One of my favorite Holvoet pieces features two decadent slices of layered cake, topped with birthday candles. “I love you so much” is written on the first slice, “I like to hold your hand,” on the second. For “Exposed,” Holvoet created colored pencil, ink and felt pen drawings on wood, depicting cross-eyed nudes with curly cue hair and drunken smiles. One, which she describes as a “fat goddess,” is a self-portrait. “Drawing naked people reminds me of the dryer vent feelings,” Holvoet told Creativity Explored’s Ellen Dahlke, who relayed the comments. “It reminds me that I want to play with others. Go in their rooms if they leave the door unlocked and play with them, naked people.” Holvoet went on to explain the intense reaction she experiences from smelling a laundry dryer, of feeling its heat. “I accidentally smelled it. I was too close. I smelled it, and then I went to Napa [State Hospital] again to get medicine,” she recalled. “It’s something connected to my brain with the laundry smell. A lot of people have connections like that between smell and sex.”For the 65-year-old artist, who is often suffused with feelings and urges she is unable to control or consummate, art provides the opportunity to exercise some of this energy. Making work that explores sexuality, Holvoet explained, “makes me feel more relaxed, more like it’s the present instead of the past. Let’s make some more [wooden sculptures of] body parts so I can get this dream of mine from last night out of my head!”“Let me put it this way, if there was no sex, there wouldn’t be nobody alive!” artist Thomas Pringle said. The 76-year-old, who has worked with Creativity Explored since 2006, uses expressive and imperfect lines to create drawings that provide insight into the full journey of their creation, missteps and all.Pringle’s watercolor figures often drop off mid-form, leaving an arm or leg unfinished like a spool of yarn unraveling. “When I make something, like a painting of a woman, it’s about sex. I use pictures, and I try to make it as a real body. I look for one that’s good-looking,” he said. For artists like Pringle, the physical act of intercourse is an impossibility, yet the feelings of erotic desire and curiosity reman. Creative expression provides an alternate outlet for lust to crescendo and subside. “I got news for you, there’s sex already happening,” he said. “With my disability, for instance, I don’t know how [to have sex], but I got it in my mind. I’m still having sex, but in a different way.” “Exposed” features work by Antonio Benjamin, Andrew Bixler, Camille Holvoet, Jose Nunez, Thomas Pringle and Kate Thompson. Curated by Amy Auerbach and Stephanie Rudd. The exhibition is on view until Sept. 28 at Creativity Explored in San Francisco. The work above is available for purchase on Artsy. "

Knox was eventually acquitted in the murder of her roommate. Right: Michelle Carter on trial in June 2017, charged with involuntary manslaughter after encouraging her boyfriend to kill himself.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5983dce5210000a134fca1ec.png?cache=XSMwGXc2cr&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Amanda Knox, once accused of murder in an infamous trial that unfolded in Italy nearly a decade ago, says that Michelle Carter needs help and sympathy, not a prison sentence.Carter, 20, was sentenced in Taunton, Massachusetts, on Thursday to 2½ years in prison for coercing her boyfriend, 18-year-old Conrad Roy, to kill himself in 2014. Carter was 17 when Roy died.Shortly after sentencing, the Los Angeles Times published an op-ed by Knox denouncing Carter’s involuntary manslaughter charges and sentencing. Knox related the trial’s publicity to her own experience as the world’s femme fatale.“It’s hard to feel sympathy for Carter, who was wrong to instruct Roy over the phone to get back into the truck in which he was poisoning himself with carbon monoxide,” Knox wrote in the Times. “But involuntary manslaughter?”Like Carter, Knox was under a similar spotlight throughout the late 2000s when she was convicted and sentenced in the murder of her British roommate, a fellow exchange student whom she lived with in Italy. And, like Carter, prosecutors painted Knox as a ruthless villain, which was reflected in tabloids across the globe: While Carter was cast as an attention-seeking girlfriend with no remorse, Knox was cast as a sex-crazed killer.Knox spent four years in an Italian prison before she was acquitted and released back to the U.S. Speculation on Knox’s innocence and guilt was revived in 2016 after Netflix released a documentary detailing her trial.Drawing from her experience as a young woman publicly accused of murder, Knox claimed that Carter was being used as a scapegoat for her boyfriend’s death.“Carter may not be innocent in a moral or philosophical sense, but she was wrongfully convicted,” Knox said, arguing that Roy was responsible for his own death.“We naturally want to blame someone for the murder, but we’re reluctant to further condemn the victim. This emotional paradox makes it hard for us to find closure,” Knox wrote. “But with Roy’s suicide, we have, in the person of Carter, another party to hold responsible.”In 2014, Carter sent Roy, her long-distance online boyfriend, a series of text messages encouraging him to follow through with his plan to kill himself. In her messages, revealed in court documents, Carter told Roy, “You have to just do it,” and, “Tonight is the night. It’s now or never.” She also expressed frustration when Roy appeared to back out.“But I bet you’re gonna be like ‘oh, it didn’t work because I didn’t tape the tube right or something like that,’” she texted Roy. “I bet you’re gonna say an excuse like that...you seem to always have an excuse.”Carter even researched ways to vent carbon monoxide into his truck and, if that failed, she suggested, “Try the bag or hanging.”Roy was found dead inside his truck at a parking on July 13, 2014. He died of carbon monoxide poisoning. Court documents revealed that, after Roy’s death, Carter had texted a friend saying she told Roy to get back into his truck after he left the vehicle and said he was scared that the carbon monoxide method was working. Defense attorneys argued that Carter, like Roy, was emotionally vulnerable and unable to take control of her actions because of prescribed psychiatric medication she was taking at the time.In her op-ed in the Times, Knox said she was disgusted to see Carter portrayed as a “cold and calculated” killer, much like she was in 2007. Knox pointed out that Carter had initially encouraged Roy to seek professional help for his suicidal ideation, but she said it was Roy who made the mistake of confiding in Carter, who Knox said is “another troubled adolescent.” “When I was on trial for murder in Italy, the media tried to paint me as a ‘femme fatale,’” Knox wrote. “So it was with a sickening sense of déjà vu that I watched the prosecution attempt the same trick with Carter.”Knox said that vilifying Carter does little to prevent the mental health issues that are relevant to Roy’s death and Carter’s trial, adding that it encourages Carter to practice more self-harm.“I should know,” Knox wrote, detailing her own thoughts of suicide during her trials in Italy.“Conrad Roy III needed our sympathy and our help and didn’t get it in time,” she added. “Michelle Carter deserves the same sympathy and help now.”Read Knox’s full op-ed in the Los Angeles Times here.If you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for the National  Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

And, like Carter, prosecutors painted Knox as a ruthless villain, which was reflected in tabloids across the globe: While Carter was cast as an attention-seeking girlfriend with no remorse, Knox was cast as a sex-crazed killer.Knox spent four years in an Italian prison before she was acquitted and released back to the U.S. Speculation on Knox’s innocence and guilt was revived in 2016 after Netflix released a documentary detailing her trial.Drawing from her experience as a young woman publicly accused of murder, Knox claimed that Carter was being used as a scapegoat for her boyfriend’s death.“Carter may not be innocent in a moral or philosophical sense, but she was wrongfully convicted,” Knox said, arguing that Roy was responsible for his own death.“We naturally want to blame someone for the murder, but we’re reluctant to further condemn the victim. This emotional paradox makes it hard for us to find closure,” Knox wrote. “But with Roy’s suicide, we have, in the person of Carter, another party to hold responsible.”In 2014, Carter sent Roy, her long-distance online boyfriend, a series of text messages encouraging him to follow through with his plan to kill himself. In her messages, revealed in court documents, Carter told Roy, “You have to just do it,” and, “Tonight is the night. It’s now or never.” She also expressed frustration when Roy appeared to back out.“But I bet you’re gonna be like ‘oh, it didn’t work because I didn’t tape the tube right or something like that,’” she texted Roy. “I bet you’re gonna say an excuse like that...you seem to always have an excuse.”Carter even researched ways to vent carbon monoxide into his truck and, if that failed, she suggested, “Try the bag or hanging.”Roy was found dead inside his truck at a parking on July 13, 2014. He died of carbon monoxide poisoning. Court documents revealed that, after Roy’s death, Carter had texted a friend saying she told Roy to get back into his truck after he left the vehicle and said he was scared that the carbon monoxide method was working. Defense attorneys argued that Carter, like Roy, was emotionally vulnerable and unable to take control of her actions because of prescribed psychiatric medication she was taking at the time.In her op-ed in the Times, Knox said she was disgusted to see Carter portrayed as a “cold and calculated” killer, much like she was in 2007. Knox pointed out that Carter had initially encouraged Roy to seek professional help for his suicidal ideation, but she said it was Roy who made the mistake of confiding in Carter, who Knox said is “another troubled adolescent.” “When I was on trial for murder in Italy, the media tried to paint me as a ‘femme fatale,’” Knox wrote. “So it was with a sickening sense of déjà vu that I watched the prosecution attempt the same trick with Carter.”Knox said that vilifying Carter does little to prevent the mental health issues that are relevant to Roy’s death and Carter’s trial, adding that it encourages Carter to practice more self-harm.“I should know,” Knox wrote, detailing her own thoughts of suicide during her trials in Italy.“Conrad Roy III needed our sympathy and our help and didn’t get it in time,” she added. “Michelle Carter deserves the same sympathy and help now.”Read Knox’s full op-ed in the Los Angeles Times here.If you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for the National  Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5984c4e71a00009bc1dc2214.jpeg?cache=J9oi1o37T5&ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"Ahead of Jerusalem’s 16th annual pride parade on Thursday, Jerusalem’s Ashkenazi chief rabbi Aryeh Stern made it clear that he didn’t think such an event belonged in the ancient, holy city.Although Stern opposed any kind of violence at the parade, which has experienced tragedy in the past, the rabbi said that holding pride in Jerusalem is “causing more damage to its supporters than benefiting them.” “The essence of this parade is contradicting the trend of Jerusalem as a holy city, and that is the city we want,” said Stern in an interview with Army Radio translated by The Jerusalem Post.Thousands of residents seemed to disagree. In fact, according to police estimates obtained by The Times of Israel, about 22,000 people attended the event ― waving rainbow colored flags, holding up signs, and singing together.This year’s theme at Jerusalem’s pride was “LGBTQ and Religion.”Dana International, a transgender Israeli pop star, wrote in a column that the parade was dedicated to religious queer Jews who “despite prohibitions, difficulties and boycotts, dare to be the first generation in our land to say in a loud voice that it is indeed possible to love and worship God and at the same time to realize who they really are.”“How important it is for the world to see the march in Jerusalem today. They will see the great light, and not the evil and fanaticism and hatred of a handful of its citizens who want to tarnish its name and all of ours,” she wrote in the op-ed. Rabbi Avi Novis Deutsch, a traditional Masorti rabbi, decided to march in the parade to show his support. In an op-ed published in Haaretz, he described the event as a “celebration of visibility.”″[It’s] an opportunity to say yes, there are transgender, bisexual, queer, asexual, gay and lesbian members of Israeli society, and they should not be ashamed. On the contrary, they should be satisfied with their lot, and we should all give thanks to the Creator who made people different from one another,” Deutsch wrote. Tensions between conservative and secular Jews in Israel have flared up at Jerusalem’s pride parade in the past.In 2015, an ultra-Orthodox Jewish man stabbed and wounded six people attending the parade, killing a 16-year-old named Shira Banki. The man, identified as Yishai Schlissel, is currently serving a life sentence in prison. This year, pride participants left flowers near the spot on the route where Banki was stabbed, and kept moments of silence. The participants were protected by heavy security measures, including video cameras, aerial surveillance, security checkpoints, and about 1,000 police and border patrol soldiers.Conservative protesters held demonstrations near the parade route. More than 20 suspects were detained by police for intending to disrupt the parade ― including one person who reportedly had a knife. Same-sex marriage is technically recognized in Israel, but queer Jewish couples have to go through a few hurdles in order to get married. All Jewish couples must get married through Israel’s Chief Rabbinate, which is opposed to marriage equality. As a result, lesbian and gay couples tend to get married overseas.But support for same-sex marriage is on the rise. A recent survey found that 79 percent of Israelis support same-sex marriage or civil unions.Scroll down for images from Jerusalem’s pride parade 2017."

Jim Justice, Donald Trump returned to West Virginia last night with another barnstorming lie that should make a Boy Scout cringe: His administration has “ended the war on beautiful, clean coal.”The August 3rd rally actually marked the 40th anniversary of the signing of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977—a loophole-ridden regulatory compromise that granted federal sanctioning to mountaintop removal and allowed a mining onslaught in over 20 states and indigenous First Nations, leaving behind a legacy of ruin—contaminated waterways, entrenched poverty, black lung disease and cancer corridors and forced displacement.Dear media: That’s the real “war” in coal country, and every time Trump trots out his “beautiful, clean coal” slogan, we need the media to hold him accountable for the toxic fallout and daily trauma of those still living in violation-ridden coal mining areas and shouldering the burden of our nation’s energy supply.“Beautiful, clean coal” is a lie. Last month, even the nation’s first major “clean coal” plant in Mississippi pulled the plug on its plans, shifting back to natural gas—having spent $7.5 billion. Last week, depositions began in a trial in Tennessee for the families of deceased workers and living survivors suffering heart and lung ailments from decade-old clean-up operations at the TVA coal ash disaster—that cost over $1.2 billion. Poorly regulated coal ash piles abound across the country. Earlier this spring, an NPR report found 1,000 additional cases of black lung disease in Appalachia—a needless malady for miners connected to the inhalation of coal dust—as part of a growing crisis. Still today, three coal miners die daily from black lung disease. In March, toxic coal slurry leaked in creeks in West Virginia and southern Illinois— a reminder of the decades of deadly coal slurry leaks that have contaminated waterways and wells. And every day, thousands of residents, many of whom live unprotected within a football field of massive detonations, fly rock and silica dust, must deal with the fallout of cancer-linked mountaintop removal strip mining in West Virginia, as well as strip mining operations in states across the country. Dear media: We need to hold Trump accountable for his “beautiful, clean coal” banter—not just report it, or worse, mock it. "

He has repeatedly criticized the slow pace of economic recovery since most international sanctions on Iran were lifted last year.Under Rouhani’s watch, Iran reached a landmark deal with six major powers in 2015 under which it agreed to curb its nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of sanctions which had been in place for a decade.After being sworn in on Saturday, Rouhani will have two weeks to present his cabinet to the parliament for a vote of confidence.“The government’s aim is to improve Iran’s image in the world ... to safeguard people’s rights ... to end poverty ... to protect the religious democracy and our people’s votes,” Rouhani said in a speech at the ceremony.Rouhani has vowed to open Iran up to international investment and trade but the Islamic Republic insider who has held senior political and military posts since the 1979 Islamic revolution, faces enormous challenges, including deepening political divisions among the country’s ruling elite and U.S. President Donald Trump’s aggressive Iran policy."

The nonagenarian was convicted in 2015 for his role in the massacre of 300,000 Jews at Auschwitz concentration camp in Nazi-occupied Poland, where as a guard he’d been tasked with sorting through the banknotes and other belongings taken from arriving prisoners.Groening, who was 20 when he joined the Waffen-SS, said he was enthusiastic when he was first sent to work at Auschwitz in 1942. He has maintained, however, that he never personally committed murder but has admitted to standing by as thousands were led to the gas chambers. “For me there’s no question that I share moral guilt,” Groening, then 93, told judges during his 2015 trial. “I ask for forgiveness. I share morally in the guilt but whether I am guilty under criminal law, you will have to decide.”As a former Nazi soldier brought to trial, Groening’s transparency about his experiences during the Holocaust has been atypical. In 2005, he spoke at length to the BBC about the horrors he had witnessed. He said at the time that he had chosen to share his story to quash the claims of Holocaust deniers.“I would like you to believe me. I saw the gas chambers. I saw the crematoria. I saw the open fires,” he said. “I would like you to believe that these atrocities happened because I was there.” Groening’s trial and subsequent conviction have triggered emotional and diverse responses from Holocaust survivors and others.His trial, noted the Guardian in 2015, went “to the heart of the question of whether people who were small cogs in the Nazi machinery, but did not actively participate in the killing of 6 million Jews during the Holocaust, were guilty of crimes.” For decades, these “small cogs” had not been prosecuted by the German justice system, but the convictions of Groening and the accused Nazi guard John Demjanjuk in 2011 showed that the courts were changing course. With most of the accused now deceased or elderly, however, Groening is believed to be one of the last Nazis to stand trial. Eva Mozes Kor, an Auschwitz survivor, said in 2015 that she’d forgiven Groening for what he’d done. She had suggested community service as a better alternative for Groening than jail time.“He was a small screw in a big killing machine, and the machine cannot function without the small screws,” said Kor, who was 10 when she was subjected to horrific medical experiments at the death camp. But the octogenarian said she had chosen to forgive the man and believed that there was value in trying to bring “the victims and the perpetrators” together to “try to heal.”A photograph from Groening’s trial shows the ex-Nazi guard kissing Kor on the cheek. Another shows Kor holding the man’s hand.“I know many people will criticize me for this photo, but so be it,” she wrote at the time. “It was two human beings 70 years after it happened. For the life of me I will never understand why anger is preferable to a goodwill gesture.”Others, however, have stressed that Groening’s participation in the Holocaust cannot be overlooked or go unpunished. Prosecutors maintain that his role may have been small, but his work ultimately helped oil the machinery that allowed the mass murders to take place.Leon Schwarzbaum was one of many Holocaust survivors who said that Groening deserved the prison sentence he received. Asked by the BBC in 2015 if he could forgive the former death camp guard, Schwarzbaum was unequivocal. “No,” he said. “I lost 30 members of my family in Auschwitz.”At least 1.3 million men, women and children were sent to Auschwitz from 1940 to 1945. About 1.1 million people, mostly Jews, were killed there. "

I saw the open fires,” he said. “I would like you to believe that these atrocities happened because I was there.” Groening’s trial and subsequent conviction have triggered emotional and diverse responses from Holocaust survivors and others.His trial, noted the Guardian in 2015, went “to the heart of the question of whether people who were small cogs in the Nazi machinery, but did not actively participate in the killing of 6 million Jews during the Holocaust, were guilty of crimes.” For decades, these “small cogs” had not been prosecuted by the German justice system, but the convictions of Groening and the accused Nazi guard John Demjanjuk in 2011 showed that the courts were changing course. With most of the accused now deceased or elderly, however, Groening is believed to be one of the last Nazis to stand trial. Eva Mozes Kor, an Auschwitz survivor, said in 2015 that she’d forgiven Groening for what he’d done. She had suggested community service as a better alternative for Groening than jail time.“He was a small screw in a big killing machine, and the machine cannot function without the small screws,” said Kor, who was 10 when she was subjected to horrific medical experiments at the death camp. But the octogenarian said she had chosen to forgive the man and believed that there was value in trying to bring “the victims and the perpetrators” together to “try to heal.”A photograph from Groening’s trial shows the ex-Nazi guard kissing Kor on the cheek. Another shows Kor holding the man’s hand.“I know many people will criticize me for this photo, but so be it,” she wrote at the time. “It was two human beings 70 years after it happened. For the life of me I will never understand why anger is preferable to a goodwill gesture.”Others, however, have stressed that Groening’s participation in the Holocaust cannot be overlooked or go unpunished. Prosecutors maintain that his role may have been small, but his work ultimately helped oil the machinery that allowed the mass murders to take place.Leon Schwarzbaum was one of many Holocaust survivors who said that Groening deserved the prison sentence he received. Asked by the BBC in 2015 if he could forgive the former death camp guard, Schwarzbaum was unequivocal. “No,” he said. “I lost 30 members of my family in Auschwitz.”At least 1.3 million men, women and children were sent to Auschwitz from 1940 to 1945. About 1.1 million people, mostly Jews, were killed there. "
