He was there to hear a eulogy for his magnets.“Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today in solemn remembrance and fond celebration of the lives of these perfectly good, not-at-all-defective magnet spheres,” said Eric Sigurdson, Qu’s most loyal employee. He addressed the tiny orbs directly, barely audible above the rumble of the huge machines. “May you one day be reforged as part of a spaceship to effect your ultimate homecoming among the supernovas that once begat you billions of years ago.”A federal judge had ordered thousands of Qu’s BB-sized metal balls ― once among America’s most popular novelty gifts ― to be destroyed because Qu had bought them from a company that promised to stop all sales as part of a government effort to protect children. Their end came in a 1,000 degree Fahrenheit furnace, where they would demagnetize, their shiny coatings would melt, and they would be left charred and dark and useless. Qu, his girlfriend, Sigurdson, furnace workers and a federal regulator looked on.The April meltdown was the latest dramatic turn in 30-year-old Qu’s relentless five-year legal fight against the federal government to save his magnets. They have been linked to horrifying injuries ― gleaming spheres swallowed by unsuspecting children can snap together inside their intestines, boring holes in the tissue or causing their bowels to twist and leading to potentially fatal consequences. But how regulators tried to protect the vulnerable ― convincing every major domestic seller, except for Qu, to take the magnets off the market, and then banning the magnets entirely ― struck many as the regulatory state run amok.Qu has seen himself labeled a reckless purveyor of products that hurt children and watched the entire industry of super-strong novelty magnetic playthings crumble around him. It has even put him before Neil Gorsuch ― then an appeals court judge, now President Donald Trump’s first Supreme Court pick ― in an effort to prove that the ban should be overturned. But while Qu was becoming the poster child for what some saw as evidence of Obama-era regulatory overstep, he was actually winning.With a soul patch and a direct manner of speaking, Qu seems more like an overly earnest college student than a scorched-earth litigant. He and his mother immigrated to Colorado from China when he was 3. They settled into Denver life easily. His mother worked as a database manager for a professional association in the health care field. He was an early entrepreneur, selling popsicles to fellow elementary school students for a small profit. In college, he posted an instructional video online of how to make a bong out of a glass bottle.He found his life’s calling on a camping trip eight years ago. Just before setting out, he had bought a set of unusually powerful magnet balls made from “rare earth” elements on the internet. While his friends enjoyed the natural splendors on the trip, Qu could not stop twisting and stacking magnets into an array of shapes. He was entranced. “Magnets,” he realized, “are a kind of magic.” Not long after, he and his then-girlfriend pooled their money – $800 – to import a batch of magnets from China. From that, Zen Magnets was born.Another young entrepreneur, Craig Zucker, realized around the same time that these magnets could be a goldmine. He launched Buckyballs, a set of small, round magnets pitched to consumers as a fun office accessory and stress reliever, in 2009. From an initial order of 100 magnet sets, Buckyballs soon had a distribution network of more than a thousand stores. Sales of the high-powered magnet balls went from nothing to millions in just three years ― Zucker has said annual sales reached $18 million by 2011, and regulators estimated average total industry revenues around $20 million ― with about 2.7 million sets (comprising hundreds of millions of individual magnets) sold by the end of 2012. Zucker controlled more than 90 percent of the growing magnet ball industry. Magazines put Buckyballs on holiday gift guides, and shoppers loved the moldable magnets they could fidget with when bored. Zucker dreamed of the big time, of making the leap from fad to American icon. “We coulda been a Lego! We coulda been a Rubik’s cube!” he later told Inc. Magazine.As an upstart in a quirky industry, Qu had to get noticed fast. So he went after his biggest competitor directly, mercilessly mocking Buckyballs in YouTube videos that claimed to show proof of Zen Magnets’ superiority. Buckyballs took the bait. Zucker’s co-founder, Jake Bronstein, left Qu a voicemail message threatening lawsuits from an “army of lawyers.” Qu turned the voicemail into another taunting video, with Bronstein’s words playing over a montage of every embarrassing picture of Bronstein he could find. It was viewed nearly half a million times ― which is a lot for a video that was essentially an airing of beef between two players in a niche business. Buckyballs continued to outsell Zen by a factor of 40 to 1, but Qu said the spat made his company more widely known and showed him irreverence works. “It’s a little sophomoric in tone, but it was probably a good marketing move,” Qu said. “Sarcasm and being flippant is a large part of what we’ve been known for. It makes [Zen Magnets] interesting to read [about].”But then magnet balls’ meteoric rise hit a wall: the Consumer Product Safety Commission. From its creation in 1972 through the late 2000s, the CPSC was a regulatory backwater, working largely out of the public eye. An independent federal agency, it is run by a group of five commissioners (currently, three Democrats and two Republicans), each appointed by the president to staggered seven-year terms, that sets policy for and oversees the work of career employees. The CPSC’s public profile changed in 2007, dubbed the “Year of the Recall” by, among others, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Consumers Union (publisher of Consumer Reports), when the commission pulled tens of millions of toys manufactured in China off U.S. shelves because of dangerous lead paint. The Chicago Tribune also published a series of Pulitzer Prize-winning articles that year about CPSC complacency in the face of reports that children were dying from swallowing strong magnets that easily broke free of their plastic housing in a popular construction toy. Public outrage led to action. In 2008, Congress passed, and President George W. Bush signed, the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act. The new law significantly increased the agency’s staff and funding, increased the agency’s enforcement powers and the size of penalties that could be used against noncompliant companies, and increased testing requirements, particularly for children’s products. The mandate was clear and bipartisan: Protect kids, and everyone else. “The CPSC used to be this sleepy little agency, and people thought they could just call the agency and work things out,” said Inez Tenenbaum, chair of the CPSC from 2009 to 2013. “After the [new law], it wasn’t business as usual.” In 2010, the CPSC started hearing complaints about kids swallowing magnets from an entirely new source: high-powered magnets sold not as encased components of other toys but as free-standing sets of hundreds of individual spheres, which could be shaped into sculptures. The numbers of potentially loose magnets for kids to swallow was staggering, and the initial injury reports were troubling. Dr. David Brumbaugh, a gastroenterologist at Children’s Hospital Colorado, works less than 2 miles from Zen Magnets’ headquarters, and he keeps a baggie in his office with four magnet balls similar to those he has removed from the intestines of young patients, tools to demonstrate safety risks to anyone who will listen. The magnet balls, he said, really are a “unique and special risk.” Not only are the magnets powerful enough to rip through tissue, Brumbaugh said, but early symptoms of ingestion seem common and benign, like a stomach ache. Doctors with little reason to suspect magnets would not know to rush kids into invasive treatment, thus giving the magnets more time to cause serious harm. According to the CPSC, more than 2,900 people were hurt swallowing similar magnets from 2009 to 2013, with most requiring interventions like snaking a scope through the patient’s intestinal tract to locate and grab the magnets or performing surgery to remove them. Teenagers occasionally swallowed magnets too, sometimes after they used the powerful magnetic pull of the spheres to mimic tongue and lip piercings.The CPSC first tried to address the issue in 2010 by working with some of the companies, like Zucker’s, to improve warnings and packaging. In 2011, the agency had helped launch a public awareness campaign and safety videos aimed at kids and parents ― one tagline was “Magnets go in easier than they come out” ― and issued a press release that November with companies explaining the dangers and urging parents who had bought magnets for younger kids to return them for a refund. Some of the magnet companies began trying to develop their own voluntary standard for sales and packaging to avert further clampdowns. But while warnings and age restrictions got better, injury reports kept coming in. Unlike some other products the CPSC had addressed, like the construction toys detailed by the Chicago Tribune that had obvious design flaws that could be improved with better manufacturing or engineering, the high-powered magnets were operating exactly as intended when they stuck together. It was only when kids swallowed those magnets that problems arose. In that way, for magnet supporters, the playsets are more like brightly colored laundry pods or batteries ― things that are extremely dangerous when eaten but still widely available.The agency faced a decision of whether it was better to keep trying to work with companies to make warnings ever bigger and bolder, and to make the packaging more difficult to pry open, or to deem the magnets so inherently dangerous that much more aggressive action was the only way forward. Less than a year after the agency launched its public awareness campaign and issued the press release, it had made up its mind that the high-powered magnets could never be made safe. So the agency went after the entire industry.The CPSC had four main options for getting these magnet balls off the market: It could issue a new regulation banning the sale of magnet balls, seek an injunction from a federal court if it deemed the risks posed a true emergency, sue companies individually in administrative court to force them to recall their products, or simply negotiate a voluntary recall with the companies directly. Issuing a new regulation is difficult ― it draws on a lot of agency resources, involves a long public comment period and must meet other legal requirements ― and injunctions require a lot of proof, fast. Now convinced that high-powered magnet spheres were an immediate, and unfixable, threat, but electing not to prove its case with an injunction, the CPSC decided to write to individual retailers ― places like Brookstone and Amazon ― to tell them the products they were selling were dangerous. It was a bold but rare decision. While such letters do not actually require a retailer to do anything, it is an atypical company that fails to take immediate action as a result, both because businesses see no reason to jeopardize children’s lives and because failing to take corrective action in the face of a direct government warning might raise the risk of future lawsuits. Magnets started disappearing from store shelves. Then, the CPSC tried to negotiate voluntary recalls with 13 of the most prominent players in the industry. One by one, the major U.S. companies selling high-powered magnet balls all took the deal and pulled out of the market. But there were holdouts: Buckyballs and Zen Magnets. For Zucker and Qu, the process was infuriating: Magnet balls had been kneecapped without the agency offering any proof that a compromise was impossible. Surely some solution could be reached, Qu believed. “Nobody around me thought magnets should be harder to obtain than guns or cars.”But for Scott Wolfson, a former spokesman for the CPSC, with lives on the line the agency had to act fast. “[Magnets are] a serious hazard that was known and there was an increasing number of incidents, and we sought to take the swiftest action possible to mitigate risks to stop any other child or tween from going to the emergency room and having their chest opened up to have magnets removed,” Wolfson said. “It’s a child safety issue. It’s not an issue about the business community.”Things escalated quickly. In July 2012, the CPSC sued Zucker’s company. In August, it sued Zen Magnets. These were the agency’s first lawsuits in 11 years, and it was difficult to remember one the agency had ever lost. In September 2012, the agency also decided to move ahead on the regulatory side, issuing a notice of a proposed regulation that would effectively prevent the sale of small magnets more than a fraction as powerful as those already being sold. The rule would essentially ban Zen Magnets and Buckyballs, as the world knew them, forever. This legal onslaught was unprecedented for the agency. “Only the most extreme and aggravated cases have litigation or rule-making,” said Charles Samuels, chairman of the consumer product safety practice at the law firm Mintz Levin. “In this case you have both.” The agency had chosen to bring the intense pressure of litigation against the only corporate holdouts while also going after future product lines.“The flip side of it is that frankly it’s hard to look at the total commission involvement without having the feeling that they wanted to wipe out this product category and that was their determination from the beginning,” Samuels said.By then, some doubt had even started to surface among the commissioners. Nancy Nord, a George W. Bush-nominated former CPSC commissioner who left the agency in late 2013 and has become a vocal critic of its aggressiveness toward magnet spheres, said the commission’s tactics may have reflected that the decisions were about more than just safety and were also a value judgment about whether society really needs what the companies were selling.“In their view, they were also dealing with an adult desk toy, for Pete’s sake. How necessary is that in our modern world? How do you balance that utility?” Nord said. But one person’s frivolity can be another’s deep passion, and, Nord wonders, why is a federal agency making that call? “Maybe the federal government isn’t the right entity to be making those decisions. Maybe the marketplace is better.”As he faced total corporate collapse, Zucker punched back. He started a cheeky campaign called Save Our Balls (and later, United We Ball) and targeted the CPSC’s commissioners personally with a full-page ad in The Washington Post. He released caricatures of them, published their phone numbers, and challenged Wolfson, the agency spokesman at the time, to debates and arm-wrestling matches. Media coverage swirled, and the narrative of government overreach started to gain traction. Zucker was featured on the Fox Business Network and “Nightline” ― HuffPost too. He was on “CBS This Morning.” Rush Limbaugh gave him a shoutout.Tenenbaum, who was chair of the CPSC at the time, said in an interview that the pushback didn’t sway her. “You look at stories of children behind the data,” she said by phone from South Carolina, where she now practices law. “They have life-altering colostomies, near-death experiences, and at least one death. That is a substantial product hazard.”Nor did the commission budge. In December 2012, Zucker threw in the towel and dissolved his company. (Zucker’s company that sold Buckyballs was called Maxfield & Oberton.) But instead of declaring victory, the CPSC added Zucker to the lawsuit as an individual, arguing that a company should not be allowed to simply walk away when millions of its products remain in homes. But it also exposed Zucker, personally, to nearly $57 million in liability. This new legal strategy caught the attention of some powerful business interests like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which feared that one core reason corporations exist ― to limit personal liability ― was suddenly at risk. While the legal arguments were novel, an administrative law judge went along with the argument. One small-government group, Cause of Action, sued the CPSC on Zucker’s behalf in late 2013, arguing that the agency had maliciously targeted Zucker because he had the gall to speak out against it (which the agency denied). Meanwhile, Qu went on his own small-bore irreverence offensive after getting sued. He started selling his magnets as only a Denver native could: in marijuana dispensaries, where sales could be restricted to adults. He took out a billboard advertisement and spoke with anyone who would listen. He turned up the snark on the warnings he put on his magnets: “OMFG READ ME,” said one. “The grumpy CPSC is about to BAN magnet spheres in the US because they are an ingestion hazard. They don’t trust that you are capable of understanding and following warnings. Prove them wrong or we all can’t have nice magnets.” He also started organizing his customers and fans, hoping to stop the proposed regulation before it could become final. The CPSC received more public comments on the regulation ― on both sides of the issue ― than almost any other proposed rule in its history. And Qu found a local lawyer, David Japha, who was willing to work with a client whose only income stream was in regulatory crosshairs.By the middle of 2014, as administrative lawsuits persisted and the CPSC inched toward a regulatory ban, the anti-regulatory ferment Zucker had invited for almost two years became too crazy, and expensive, for him to handle. A self-described “lifelong Democrat,” Zucker was overwhelmed. “I ended up at the Koch brothers’ annual fundraising convention as an opening speaker, sitting next to Mitch McConnell. Before and after the speech, I kept thinking, ‘What the fuck? I was a guy who wanted to sell a fun desk toy. How did it lead to this?’ I asked myself that question a lot.” Zucker settled with the CPSC, setting aside $375,000 to cover a recall and shutting his doors. At least one product liability suit from a severely injured child still lingers. With Zucker gone, Qu became the sole heir to the cause.To prove that its proposed regulation to ban high-powered magnets should actually be adopted, the CPSC had to show that the costs of such an act justified the benefits. So it tried to calculate them. The balls had caused 2,138 injuries from 2009 to 2012, at an estimated cost of $28.6 million in medical expenses. Taking them off the market would mean $6 million in lost profits for the balls’ proprietors, regulators projected. Action, the agency said, was clearly justified.But the CPSC was at a loss for determining what the societal cost would be of removing the magnets from stores. What is the joy of playing with pointless magnets really worth, anyway? “We have no information … on the amount of utility that would be lost from a magnet rule,” the agency wrote in support of the final regulation. And if consumer love for the magnet balls turned out to be “faddish,” love of magnets would quickly fade. If the regulation went through, Qu would be unable to import any new magnets, on top of dealing with the original lawsuit the agency had filed against his company, which would force him to stop selling the magnets he already had and give refunds. In the months before the final vote on the regulation, “I was already in the mindset that none of this is going to work out, that I should put it behind me” and end the business, Qu said. Things were dark. “The world isn’t a fairy tale. We were in negative money, running off a credit line, off saved income.” Qu went to China to develop even tinier, far weaker magnets he hoped would satisfy the CPSC, but they could not hold together for the elaborate designs he thought magnet buyers needed and wanted. Still, he started selling them.In 2014, the CPSC’s anti-magnet rule became final. After the vote, then-CPSC Chairman Elliot Kaye spoke about the horrors endured by the family of one young girl who died as a result of ingesting magnets. They had made the trip to the CPSC hearing to watch the rule become final. Then he addressed Qu: “I hope your dreaming will continue and that inspiration will strike again, and that there is a path forward that secures for you that elusive childhood wonder, but in a way that can endure.” Qu filed an appeal in federal court instead. The odds were long. No CPSC rule had been overturned on appeal in more than 30 years. Other countries took notice, though not the way Qu would have liked. Canada also went after the magnets, issuing its first-ever mandatory consumer product recall on the basis that the magnets were a “danger to human health and safety.” New Zealand and Australia banned them, too.Soon after the regulation was approved, CPSC’s lawsuit against Zen Magnets rumbled toward a two-and-a-half-week trial.The agency’s arguments hadn’t changed. The CPSC argued again and again what seemed to it to be obvious: Magnet balls are inherently defective, and allowing the sale of the novelty toys ― even if they are marketed to adults ― was just not that important when balanced against the lives of children, who would never see warnings on a package when they came across loose magnets lying on the floor and inevitably ate them. The CPSC put forward a string of experts, who stressed the magnets’ dangers and the futility of warnings. Qu chiefly relied on a single expert: Boyd Edwards, a physics professor at Utah State University who had befriended Qu when he contacted Zen Magnets’ customer service to complain about inconsistently sized magnet balls. Edwards was a magnet lover, and had been uploading tutorial videos to YouTube about his elaborate creations, such as a “three-level fractal Sierpinski Tetrahedron” and a hollow cube that he used, inexplicably, to encase a bottle of Kraft reduced fat mayonnaise with olive oil. Edwards told the judge the magnets were important ― teachers used them, and many people drew inspiration from them. “Like all good science, magnet spheres engage both the analytical and the artistic centers of the brain, echoing Henri Poincaré’s sentiment, ‘The scientist does not study nature because it is useful; he studies it because he delights in it, and he delights in it because it is beautiful. If nature were not beautiful, it would not be worth knowing,’” Edwards wrote in his testimony to the court. (He also told the court that “At a 2013 New Year’s party with family members and friends, I used a PowerPoint presentation to teach partygoers about the Platonic solids, and taught them how to use Zen magnets to build an icosahedron.”) As Qu waited for a decision, his company was falling apart. He’d had to lay off all his employees except Sigurdson, and he’d moved the Zen Magnets headquarters from an office and small warehouse to a bedroom in his house. Then things got even worse for Qu’s business. Just before one of the other magnet companies had settled with the CPSC back in 2014, he’d bought up its entire stock of magnets, which he intended to sell. But then in 2015 the Department of Justice filed a separate suit against Qu and Zen Magnets, saying the purchase of the magnet stock violated the law and flouted the spirit of the regulator’s agreement. A federal judge agreed, later approving a $5.5 million penalty against Qu and ordering him to destroy the magnets. Qu was broke, so he reached a deal with DOJ to pay only $10,000. It was that order that led Qu to find the metal treatment plant on the outskirts of Denver this April to roast his hundreds of thousands of now-illicit magnets. Not one to pass up a chance for spectacle, Qu had convinced the plant’s manager to custom-design a furnace door with see-through windows to allow for filming and, hopefully, another viral video. That April day, Qu upped the ante further, piloting a drone past amused workers and a decidedly unamused CPSC observer to capture the magnet destruction from the air.“I am taking nothing away from this except video and scrap metal,” Qu said. But despite losing that fight, Qu is winning the bigger battle over high-powered magnet balls. In March 2016, Judge Dean Metry, the administrative law judge in the CPSC’s mandatory recall lawsuit against Qu, handed Qu a stunning win. Though magnets are dangerous when swallowed, the judge said, magnets aren’t defective just because they act like magnets and stick together. Or as the judge put it: “[T]he attractiveness of the [magnets] to each other is the sine qua non of their essence. Without the ability to attract each other, the product is worthless.” Importantly, the judge also found the magnets did have utility, even if only to spark interest in science, and said warnings about them did what they were supposed to do.Going even further, the judge found that the estimated several hundred swallowing incidents per year ― the most the CPSC could claim to show, and a number that included all brands of magnets, not just Zen Magnets ― was “insignificant” compared to the millions of magnets sold, especially where there was little evidence linking any particular injury to Zen Magnets in particular. The CPSC was floored. The agency filed an appeal a month later, charging that the judge “misconstrued, misapplied, and misunderstood the law and regulations.” (In a quirk of the administrative process, the appeal will be decided by none other than the CPSC’s commissioners themselves, most of whom already voted in favor of the separate regulation to rid the market of the magnets entirely, a turn of events that leads some to see a conflict of interest, something the majority of the commissioners deny.)More bad news for the agency came later that year. Two federal appellate judges ― including Neil Gorsuch, whom Trump would soon pluck off the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit to serve on the highest court in the land ― vacated the regulation prohibiting the sale of Zen Magnets. It was the CPSC’s first such loss in more than 30 years. The problem, as the court saw it, came down to the data. The agency had already eviscerated the market for magnets, so how could data from a few years ago show that a rule banning magnet balls was necessary today? Plus, the data on injuries was too unreliable. To figure out just how many people were hurt by magnets, the CPSC had taken a statistical sample of injuries from hospitals around the country, combing through injury “narratives” written by doctors. But because doctors often only write that they extracted “magnets” and not “Zen Magnets” or “magnet balls,” most of the injuries were only “possibly” connected to the product. This, the court ruled, wasn’t good enough. Finally, the agency had given too little thought to how useful magnets really were ― in other words, they needed to take people like Edwards more seriously. Magnet balls were suddenly legal again. Qu raced to fill orders. He hired staff and moved his office out of the bedroom. “For a while, there was celebration, but it was also kind of surreal,” Qu said. The CPSC was “an unforeseeable goliath. We had been promised by many people there was no way we could succeed. ... Obviously it is not easy to say retrospectively that it was worth it.”In March of this year, the CPSC commissioners got together to figure out what to do next. Magnets were still dangerous when they were swallowed ― they always had been ― but was compromise possible after all these years of fighting? The mood was starting to shift.At that public hearing, one of the CPSC commissioners, Joseph Mohorovic, indignantly rejected a proposal that the agency start the fight over again. “I think this is a factor of pure ego. And this agency has taken the thoughtful opinions of the 10th Circuit personally, and we just want to win for winning’s sake,” he said. “It’s an exercise in pure regulatory hubris to ignore that criticism and stitch together the tattered scraps of this rule and run it back up the flagpole.” It was a remarkable change for a commissioner who, when voting in favor of the magnet ban three years earlier, called magnet balls a “quintessential latent hazard.” The proposal passed, but on party lines ― a change from the anti-magnet unanimity of the past. The current commission consists of three Democrats and two Republicans all nominated by President Barack Obama, a lineup unchanged in the years since the 4-0 vote to adopt the anti-magnet regulation. (Ann Marie Buerkle, a Republican former congresswoman, abstained from the regulation vote because the commissioners themselves would have to serve as appellate judges for any challenge to the lawsuit against Qu, and she thought it would be difficult to be seen as impartial if they were simultaneously voting to ban that same product.) Following President Trump’s election, Buerkle became the commission’s acting chair, and in July, Trump nominated her for the permanent position and another seven-year term. But the political balance is set to shift soon: The next opening set to come up is that of a Democrat. That could prove decisive as both Buerkle and Mohorovic have made their skepticism known. Following the vote, the agency started its statistical work again. For those in favor of banning the magnets, the CPSC’s attempt to rework the regulation isn’t just about clarifying the statistics they used to write the original ban. It’s about proving the regulatory process works. “Industry always fights the data on every single issue. Industry is always looking for a reason why it’s not their product,” said Rachel Weintraub, legislative director of the Consumer Federation of America. “As a society, where do we want to place that burden?”And Robert Adler, a CPSC commissioner since 2009, fears the future could prove even more dangerous, especially as new retailers swoop in to the now-regulation-free market. “The hazards of this product have not disappeared, and if recent information is correct, the hazard is extremely likely to grow significantly as new firms enter the magnet market,” Adler said at the March hearing. Wolfson, the former agency spokesman, put it more bluntly: “For anyone to raise doubts about the risk to children is disrespecting families that suffered incredible trauma, seeing children rushed into surgery, children after surgery continuing to be hooked up to different monitors and fed intravenously because their small intestines are so damaged.”After his long, single-minded fight against the CPSC, Qu wonders if all the time and money might have been better spent on something else ― public awareness campaigns, perhaps, or child-proof packaging. The magnet balls are still magnet balls, and they’re dangerous or they’re not, depending on your perspective. One thing, though, is clear: Qu may have been the last man standing in the fight against the CPSC, but he’s no longer alone in selling the novelty products. Magnet vendors from overseas have flooded the online market, selling products that appear to be similar and often seem to come with no warnings at all.While CPSC staffers are now back at work trying to figure out if a new, revised regulation to stop future sales of the high-powered magnets is something the agency should one day adopt, the market is once again open. But the lawsuit against Qu to force him to recall his old magnets continues. Following Qu’s March 2016 victory in front of the administrative law judge, the commission filed its appeal.In early June of this year, Qu, his lawyer and a large group of observers from the CPSC converged on a hearing room in an office tower in Bethesda, Maryland, to hear arguments. No one quite knew what was going to happen. There hadn’t been an appeal like this in decades, and the kinks were still being worked out. The presentations began. The CPSC said the dangers of magnets were clear to everyone by now, and the law was clear too: “We don’t need a body count” to take action, said the CPSC’s lawyer. Qu’s lawyer, in response, played a video, called “Childhood Wonder,” that showed Qu constructing sculptures with his magnets. The hearing ended after two hours. Qu left, unsure of his fate.But he’s vowed to keep pressing his case ― and selling magnets. Qu originally thought he would hedge his bets. In February, he helped launch Speks, a new brand of “compliance magnets” that meet the now-vacated CPSC safety standard. They aren’t as strong as Zen Magnets and can’t make the same types of fantastic shapes, but they seem to make people happy. And he has an unexpected new partner in the venture: Craig Zucker. With the help of Zucker’s old contacts, Speks are already appearing in stores across the country, raising the prospects of a lucrative future. (Zucker enthusiastically claims sales are at “close to Buckyballs levels.”) But recently, Qu decided to significantly reduce his role in the arrangement. Speks, he said, was taking too much time away from the thing he really loves: super-strong Zen Magnets.Qu hopes the magnet era will come roaring back, but whether it is already over remains to be seen. At the June hearing, Qu listened intently, his hands moving restlessly in his lap. But he wasn’t playing with magnets. He was whirling a fidget spinner, the hottest toy of 2017.

He addressed the tiny orbs directly, barely audible above the rumble of the huge machines. “May you one day be reforged as part of a spaceship to effect your ultimate homecoming among the supernovas that once begat you billions of years ago.”A federal judge had ordered thousands of Qu’s BB-sized metal balls ― once among America’s most popular novelty gifts ― to be destroyed because Qu had bought them from a company that promised to stop all sales as part of a government effort to protect children. Their end came in a 1,000 degree Fahrenheit furnace, where they would demagnetize, their shiny coatings would melt, and they would be left charred and dark and useless. Qu, his girlfriend, Sigurdson, furnace workers and a federal regulator looked on.The April meltdown was the latest dramatic turn in 30-year-old Qu’s relentless five-year legal fight against the federal government to save his magnets. They have been linked to horrifying injuries ― gleaming spheres swallowed by unsuspecting children can snap together inside their intestines, boring holes in the tissue or causing their bowels to twist and leading to potentially fatal consequences. But how regulators tried to protect the vulnerable ― convincing every major domestic seller, except for Qu, to take the magnets off the market, and then banning the magnets entirely ― struck many as the regulatory state run amok.Qu has seen himself labeled a reckless purveyor of products that hurt children and watched the entire industry of super-strong novelty magnetic playthings crumble around him. It has even put him before Neil Gorsuch ― then an appeals court judge, now President Donald Trump’s first Supreme Court pick ― in an effort to prove that the ban should be overturned. But while Qu was becoming the poster child for what some saw as evidence of Obama-era regulatory overstep, he was actually winning.With a soul patch and a direct manner of speaking, Qu seems more like an overly earnest college student than a scorched-earth litigant. He and his mother immigrated to Colorado from China when he was 3. They settled into Denver life easily. His mother worked as a database manager for a professional association in the health care field. He was an early entrepreneur, selling popsicles to fellow elementary school students for a small profit. In college, he posted an instructional video online of how to make a bong out of a glass bottle.He found his life’s calling on a camping trip eight years ago. Just before setting out, he had bought a set of unusually powerful magnet balls made from “rare earth” elements on the internet. While his friends enjoyed the natural splendors on the trip, Qu could not stop twisting and stacking magnets into an array of shapes. He was entranced. “Magnets,” he realized, “are a kind of magic.” Not long after, he and his then-girlfriend pooled their money – $800 – to import a batch of magnets from China. From that, Zen Magnets was born.Another young entrepreneur, Craig Zucker, realized around the same time that these magnets could be a goldmine. He launched Buckyballs, a set of small, round magnets pitched to consumers as a fun office accessory and stress reliever, in 2009. From an initial order of 100 magnet sets, Buckyballs soon had a distribution network of more than a thousand stores. Sales of the high-powered magnet balls went from nothing to millions in just three years ― Zucker has said annual sales reached $18 million by 2011, and regulators estimated average total industry revenues around $20 million ― with about 2.7 million sets (comprising hundreds of millions of individual magnets) sold by the end of 2012. Zucker controlled more than 90 percent of the growing magnet ball industry. Magazines put Buckyballs on holiday gift guides, and shoppers loved the moldable magnets they could fidget with when bored. Zucker dreamed of the big time, of making the leap from fad to American icon. “We coulda been a Lego! We coulda been a Rubik’s cube!” he later told Inc. Magazine.As an upstart in a quirky industry, Qu had to get noticed fast. So he went after his biggest competitor directly, mercilessly mocking Buckyballs in YouTube videos that claimed to show proof of Zen Magnets’ superiority. Buckyballs took the bait. Zucker’s co-founder, Jake Bronstein, left Qu a voicemail message threatening lawsuits from an “army of lawyers.” Qu turned the voicemail into another taunting video, with Bronstein’s words playing over a montage of every embarrassing picture of Bronstein he could find. It was viewed nearly half a million times ― which is a lot for a video that was essentially an airing of beef between two players in a niche business. Buckyballs continued to outsell Zen by a factor of 40 to 1, but Qu said the spat made his company more widely known and showed him irreverence works. “It’s a little sophomoric in tone, but it was probably a good marketing move,” Qu said. “Sarcasm and being flippant is a large part of what we’ve been known for. It makes [Zen Magnets] interesting to read [about].”But then magnet balls’ meteoric rise hit a wall: the Consumer Product Safety Commission. From its creation in 1972 through the late 2000s, the CPSC was a regulatory backwater, working largely out of the public eye. An independent federal agency, it is run by a group of five commissioners (currently, three Democrats and two Republicans), each appointed by the president to staggered seven-year terms, that sets policy for and oversees the work of career employees. The CPSC’s public profile changed in 2007, dubbed the “Year of the Recall” by, among others, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Consumers Union (publisher of Consumer Reports), when the commission pulled tens of millions of toys manufactured in China off U.S. shelves because of dangerous lead paint. The Chicago Tribune also published a series of Pulitzer Prize-winning articles that year about CPSC complacency in the face of reports that children were dying from swallowing strong magnets that easily broke free of their plastic housing in a popular construction toy. Public outrage led to action. In 2008, Congress passed, and President George W. Bush signed, the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act. The new law significantly increased the agency’s staff and funding, increased the agency’s enforcement powers and the size of penalties that could be used against noncompliant companies, and increased testing requirements, particularly for children’s products. The mandate was clear and bipartisan: Protect kids, and everyone else. “The CPSC used to be this sleepy little agency, and people thought they could just call the agency and work things out,” said Inez Tenenbaum, chair of the CPSC from 2009 to 2013. “After the [new law], it wasn’t business as usual.” In 2010, the CPSC started hearing complaints about kids swallowing magnets from an entirely new source: high-powered magnets sold not as encased components of other toys but as free-standing sets of hundreds of individual spheres, which could be shaped into sculptures. The numbers of potentially loose magnets for kids to swallow was staggering, and the initial injury reports were troubling. Dr. David Brumbaugh, a gastroenterologist at Children’s Hospital Colorado, works less than 2 miles from Zen Magnets’ headquarters, and he keeps a baggie in his office with four magnet balls similar to those he has removed from the intestines of young patients, tools to demonstrate safety risks to anyone who will listen. The magnet balls, he said, really are a “unique and special risk.” Not only are the magnets powerful enough to rip through tissue, Brumbaugh said, but early symptoms of ingestion seem common and benign, like a stomach ache. Doctors with little reason to suspect magnets would not know to rush kids into invasive treatment, thus giving the magnets more time to cause serious harm. According to the CPSC, more than 2,900 people were hurt swallowing similar magnets from 2009 to 2013, with most requiring interventions like snaking a scope through the patient’s intestinal tract to locate and grab the magnets or performing surgery to remove them. Teenagers occasionally swallowed magnets too, sometimes after they used the powerful magnetic pull of the spheres to mimic tongue and lip piercings.The CPSC first tried to address the issue in 2010 by working with some of the companies, like Zucker’s, to improve warnings and packaging. In 2011, the agency had helped launch a public awareness campaign and safety videos aimed at kids and parents ― one tagline was “Magnets go in easier than they come out” ― and issued a press release that November with companies explaining the dangers and urging parents who had bought magnets for younger kids to return them for a refund. Some of the magnet companies began trying to develop their own voluntary standard for sales and packaging to avert further clampdowns. But while warnings and age restrictions got better, injury reports kept coming in. Unlike some other products the CPSC had addressed, like the construction toys detailed by the Chicago Tribune that had obvious design flaws that could be improved with better manufacturing or engineering, the high-powered magnets were operating exactly as intended when they stuck together. It was only when kids swallowed those magnets that problems arose. In that way, for magnet supporters, the playsets are more like brightly colored laundry pods or batteries ― things that are extremely dangerous when eaten but still widely available.The agency faced a decision of whether it was better to keep trying to work with companies to make warnings ever bigger and bolder, and to make the packaging more difficult to pry open, or to deem the magnets so inherently dangerous that much more aggressive action was the only way forward. Less than a year after the agency launched its public awareness campaign and issued the press release, it had made up its mind that the high-powered magnets could never be made safe. So the agency went after the entire industry.The CPSC had four main options for getting these magnet balls off the market: It could issue a new regulation banning the sale of magnet balls, seek an injunction from a federal court if it deemed the risks posed a true emergency, sue companies individually in administrative court to force them to recall their products, or simply negotiate a voluntary recall with the companies directly. Issuing a new regulation is difficult ― it draws on a lot of agency resources, involves a long public comment period and must meet other legal requirements ― and injunctions require a lot of proof, fast. Now convinced that high-powered magnet spheres were an immediate, and unfixable, threat, but electing not to prove its case with an injunction, the CPSC decided to write to individual retailers ― places like Brookstone and Amazon ― to tell them the products they were selling were dangerous. It was a bold but rare decision. While such letters do not actually require a retailer to do anything, it is an atypical company that fails to take immediate action as a result, both because businesses see no reason to jeopardize children’s lives and because failing to take corrective action in the face of a direct government warning might raise the risk of future lawsuits. Magnets started disappearing from store shelves. Then, the CPSC tried to negotiate voluntary recalls with 13 of the most prominent players in the industry. One by one, the major U.S. companies selling high-powered magnet balls all took the deal and pulled out of the market. But there were holdouts: Buckyballs and Zen Magnets. For Zucker and Qu, the process was infuriating: Magnet balls had been kneecapped without the agency offering any proof that a compromise was impossible. Surely some solution could be reached, Qu believed. “Nobody around me thought magnets should be harder to obtain than guns or cars.”But for Scott Wolfson, a former spokesman for the CPSC, with lives on the line the agency had to act fast. “[Magnets are] a serious hazard that was known and there was an increasing number of incidents, and we sought to take the swiftest action possible to mitigate risks to stop any other child or tween from going to the emergency room and having their chest opened up to have magnets removed,” Wolfson said. “It’s a child safety issue. It’s not an issue about the business community.”Things escalated quickly. In July 2012, the CPSC sued Zucker’s company. In August, it sued Zen Magnets. These were the agency’s first lawsuits in 11 years, and it was difficult to remember one the agency had ever lost. In September 2012, the agency also decided to move ahead on the regulatory side, issuing a notice of a proposed regulation that would effectively prevent the sale of small magnets more than a fraction as powerful as those already being sold. The rule would essentially ban Zen Magnets and Buckyballs, as the world knew them, forever. This legal onslaught was unprecedented for the agency. “Only the most extreme and aggravated cases have litigation or rule-making,” said Charles Samuels, chairman of the consumer product safety practice at the law firm Mintz Levin. “In this case you have both.” The agency had chosen to bring the intense pressure of litigation against the only corporate holdouts while also going after future product lines.“The flip side of it is that frankly it’s hard to look at the total commission involvement without having the feeling that they wanted to wipe out this product category and that was their determination from the beginning,” Samuels said.By then, some doubt had even started to surface among the commissioners. Nancy Nord, a George W. Bush-nominated former CPSC commissioner who left the agency in late 2013 and has become a vocal critic of its aggressiveness toward magnet spheres, said the commission’s tactics may have reflected that the decisions were about more than just safety and were also a value judgment about whether society really needs what the companies were selling.“In their view, they were also dealing with an adult desk toy, for Pete’s sake. How necessary is that in our modern world? How do you balance that utility?” Nord said. But one person’s frivolity can be another’s deep passion, and, Nord wonders, why is a federal agency making that call? “Maybe the federal government isn’t the right entity to be making those decisions. Maybe the marketplace is better.”As he faced total corporate collapse, Zucker punched back. He started a cheeky campaign called Save Our Balls (and later, United We Ball) and targeted the CPSC’s commissioners personally with a full-page ad in The Washington Post. He released caricatures of them, published their phone numbers, and challenged Wolfson, the agency spokesman at the time, to debates and arm-wrestling matches. Media coverage swirled, and the narrative of government overreach started to gain traction. Zucker was featured on the Fox Business Network and “Nightline” ― HuffPost too. He was on “CBS This Morning.” Rush Limbaugh gave him a shoutout.Tenenbaum, who was chair of the CPSC at the time, said in an interview that the pushback didn’t sway her. “You look at stories of children behind the data,” she said by phone from South Carolina, where she now practices law. “They have life-altering colostomies, near-death experiences, and at least one death. That is a substantial product hazard.”Nor did the commission budge. In December 2012, Zucker threw in the towel and dissolved his company. (Zucker’s company that sold Buckyballs was called Maxfield & Oberton.) But instead of declaring victory, the CPSC added Zucker to the lawsuit as an individual, arguing that a company should not be allowed to simply walk away when millions of its products remain in homes. But it also exposed Zucker, personally, to nearly $57 million in liability. This new legal strategy caught the attention of some powerful business interests like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which feared that one core reason corporations exist ― to limit personal liability ― was suddenly at risk. While the legal arguments were novel, an administrative law judge went along with the argument. One small-government group, Cause of Action, sued the CPSC on Zucker’s behalf in late 2013, arguing that the agency had maliciously targeted Zucker because he had the gall to speak out against it (which the agency denied). Meanwhile, Qu went on his own small-bore irreverence offensive after getting sued. He started selling his magnets as only a Denver native could: in marijuana dispensaries, where sales could be restricted to adults. He took out a billboard advertisement and spoke with anyone who would listen. He turned up the snark on the warnings he put on his magnets: “OMFG READ ME,” said one. “The grumpy CPSC is about to BAN magnet spheres in the US because they are an ingestion hazard. They don’t trust that you are capable of understanding and following warnings. Prove them wrong or we all can’t have nice magnets.” He also started organizing his customers and fans, hoping to stop the proposed regulation before it could become final. The CPSC received more public comments on the regulation ― on both sides of the issue ― than almost any other proposed rule in its history. And Qu found a local lawyer, David Japha, who was willing to work with a client whose only income stream was in regulatory crosshairs.By the middle of 2014, as administrative lawsuits persisted and the CPSC inched toward a regulatory ban, the anti-regulatory ferment Zucker had invited for almost two years became too crazy, and expensive, for him to handle. A self-described “lifelong Democrat,” Zucker was overwhelmed. “I ended up at the Koch brothers’ annual fundraising convention as an opening speaker, sitting next to Mitch McConnell. Before and after the speech, I kept thinking, ‘What the fuck? I was a guy who wanted to sell a fun desk toy. How did it lead to this?’ I asked myself that question a lot.” Zucker settled with the CPSC, setting aside $375,000 to cover a recall and shutting his doors. At least one product liability suit from a severely injured child still lingers. With Zucker gone, Qu became the sole heir to the cause.To prove that its proposed regulation to ban high-powered magnets should actually be adopted, the CPSC had to show that the costs of such an act justified the benefits. So it tried to calculate them. The balls had caused 2,138 injuries from 2009 to 2012, at an estimated cost of $28.6 million in medical expenses. Taking them off the market would mean $6 million in lost profits for the balls’ proprietors, regulators projected. Action, the agency said, was clearly justified.But the CPSC was at a loss for determining what the societal cost would be of removing the magnets from stores. What is the joy of playing with pointless magnets really worth, anyway? “We have no information … on the amount of utility that would be lost from a magnet rule,” the agency wrote in support of the final regulation. And if consumer love for the magnet balls turned out to be “faddish,” love of magnets would quickly fade. If the regulation went through, Qu would be unable to import any new magnets, on top of dealing with the original lawsuit the agency had filed against his company, which would force him to stop selling the magnets he already had and give refunds. In the months before the final vote on the regulation, “I was already in the mindset that none of this is going to work out, that I should put it behind me” and end the business, Qu said. Things were dark. “The world isn’t a fairy tale. We were in negative money, running off a credit line, off saved income.” Qu went to China to develop even tinier, far weaker magnets he hoped would satisfy the CPSC, but they could not hold together for the elaborate designs he thought magnet buyers needed and wanted. Still, he started selling them.In 2014, the CPSC’s anti-magnet rule became final. After the vote, then-CPSC Chairman Elliot Kaye spoke about the horrors endured by the family of one young girl who died as a result of ingesting magnets. They had made the trip to the CPSC hearing to watch the rule become final. Then he addressed Qu: “I hope your dreaming will continue and that inspiration will strike again, and that there is a path forward that secures for you that elusive childhood wonder, but in a way that can endure.” Qu filed an appeal in federal court instead. The odds were long. No CPSC rule had been overturned on appeal in more than 30 years. Other countries took notice, though not the way Qu would have liked. Canada also went after the magnets, issuing its first-ever mandatory consumer product recall on the basis that the magnets were a “danger to human health and safety.” New Zealand and Australia banned them, too.Soon after the regulation was approved, CPSC’s lawsuit against Zen Magnets rumbled toward a two-and-a-half-week trial.The agency’s arguments hadn’t changed. The CPSC argued again and again what seemed to it to be obvious: Magnet balls are inherently defective, and allowing the sale of the novelty toys ― even if they are marketed to adults ― was just not that important when balanced against the lives of children, who would never see warnings on a package when they came across loose magnets lying on the floor and inevitably ate them. The CPSC put forward a string of experts, who stressed the magnets’ dangers and the futility of warnings. Qu chiefly relied on a single expert: Boyd Edwards, a physics professor at Utah State University who had befriended Qu when he contacted Zen Magnets’ customer service to complain about inconsistently sized magnet balls. Edwards was a magnet lover, and had been uploading tutorial videos to YouTube about his elaborate creations, such as a “three-level fractal Sierpinski Tetrahedron” and a hollow cube that he used, inexplicably, to encase a bottle of Kraft reduced fat mayonnaise with olive oil. Edwards told the judge the magnets were important ― teachers used them, and many people drew inspiration from them. “Like all good science, magnet spheres engage both the analytical and the artistic centers of the brain, echoing Henri Poincaré’s sentiment, ‘The scientist does not study nature because it is useful; he studies it because he delights in it, and he delights in it because it is beautiful. If nature were not beautiful, it would not be worth knowing,’” Edwards wrote in his testimony to the court. (He also told the court that “At a 2013 New Year’s party with family members and friends, I used a PowerPoint presentation to teach partygoers about the Platonic solids, and taught them how to use Zen magnets to build an icosahedron.”) As Qu waited for a decision, his company was falling apart. He’d had to lay off all his employees except Sigurdson, and he’d moved the Zen Magnets headquarters from an office and small warehouse to a bedroom in his house. Then things got even worse for Qu’s business. Just before one of the other magnet companies had settled with the CPSC back in 2014, he’d bought up its entire stock of magnets, which he intended to sell. But then in 2015 the Department of Justice filed a separate suit against Qu and Zen Magnets, saying the purchase of the magnet stock violated the law and flouted the spirit of the regulator’s agreement. A federal judge agreed, later approving a $5.5 million penalty against Qu and ordering him to destroy the magnets. Qu was broke, so he reached a deal with DOJ to pay only $10,000. It was that order that led Qu to find the metal treatment plant on the outskirts of Denver this April to roast his hundreds of thousands of now-illicit magnets. Not one to pass up a chance for spectacle, Qu had convinced the plant’s manager to custom-design a furnace door with see-through windows to allow for filming and, hopefully, another viral video. That April day, Qu upped the ante further, piloting a drone past amused workers and a decidedly unamused CPSC observer to capture the magnet destruction from the air.“I am taking nothing away from this except video and scrap metal,” Qu said. But despite losing that fight, Qu is winning the bigger battle over high-powered magnet balls. In March 2016, Judge Dean Metry, the administrative law judge in the CPSC’s mandatory recall lawsuit against Qu, handed Qu a stunning win. Though magnets are dangerous when swallowed, the judge said, magnets aren’t defective just because they act like magnets and stick together. Or as the judge put it: “[T]he attractiveness of the [magnets] to each other is the sine qua non of their essence. Without the ability to attract each other, the product is worthless.” Importantly, the judge also found the magnets did have utility, even if only to spark interest in science, and said warnings about them did what they were supposed to do.Going even further, the judge found that the estimated several hundred swallowing incidents per year ― the most the CPSC could claim to show, and a number that included all brands of magnets, not just Zen Magnets ― was “insignificant” compared to the millions of magnets sold, especially where there was little evidence linking any particular injury to Zen Magnets in particular. The CPSC was floored. The agency filed an appeal a month later, charging that the judge “misconstrued, misapplied, and misunderstood the law and regulations.” (In a quirk of the administrative process, the appeal will be decided by none other than the CPSC’s commissioners themselves, most of whom already voted in favor of the separate regulation to rid the market of the magnets entirely, a turn of events that leads some to see a conflict of interest, something the majority of the commissioners deny.)More bad news for the agency came later that year. Two federal appellate judges ― including Neil Gorsuch, whom Trump would soon pluck off the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit to serve on the highest court in the land ― vacated the regulation prohibiting the sale of Zen Magnets. It was the CPSC’s first such loss in more than 30 years. The problem, as the court saw it, came down to the data. The agency had already eviscerated the market for magnets, so how could data from a few years ago show that a rule banning magnet balls was necessary today? Plus, the data on injuries was too unreliable. To figure out just how many people were hurt by magnets, the CPSC had taken a statistical sample of injuries from hospitals around the country, combing through injury “narratives” written by doctors. But because doctors often only write that they extracted “magnets” and not “Zen Magnets” or “magnet balls,” most of the injuries were only “possibly” connected to the product. This, the court ruled, wasn’t good enough. Finally, the agency had given too little thought to how useful magnets really were ― in other words, they needed to take people like Edwards more seriously. Magnet balls were suddenly legal again. Qu raced to fill orders. He hired staff and moved his office out of the bedroom. “For a while, there was celebration, but it was also kind of surreal,” Qu said. The CPSC was “an unforeseeable goliath. We had been promised by many people there was no way we could succeed. ... Obviously it is not easy to say retrospectively that it was worth it.”In March of this year, the CPSC commissioners got together to figure out what to do next. Magnets were still dangerous when they were swallowed ― they always had been ― but was compromise possible after all these years of fighting? The mood was starting to shift.At that public hearing, one of the CPSC commissioners, Joseph Mohorovic, indignantly rejected a proposal that the agency start the fight over again. “I think this is a factor of pure ego. And this agency has taken the thoughtful opinions of the 10th Circuit personally, and we just want to win for winning’s sake,” he said. “It’s an exercise in pure regulatory hubris to ignore that criticism and stitch together the tattered scraps of this rule and run it back up the flagpole.” It was a remarkable change for a commissioner who, when voting in favor of the magnet ban three years earlier, called magnet balls a “quintessential latent hazard.” The proposal passed, but on party lines ― a change from the anti-magnet unanimity of the past. The current commission consists of three Democrats and two Republicans all nominated by President Barack Obama, a lineup unchanged in the years since the 4-0 vote to adopt the anti-magnet regulation. (Ann Marie Buerkle, a Republican former congresswoman, abstained from the regulation vote because the commissioners themselves would have to serve as appellate judges for any challenge to the lawsuit against Qu, and she thought it would be difficult to be seen as impartial if they were simultaneously voting to ban that same product.) Following President Trump’s election, Buerkle became the commission’s acting chair, and in July, Trump nominated her for the permanent position and another seven-year term. But the political balance is set to shift soon: The next opening set to come up is that of a Democrat. That could prove decisive as both Buerkle and Mohorovic have made their skepticism known. Following the vote, the agency started its statistical work again. For those in favor of banning the magnets, the CPSC’s attempt to rework the regulation isn’t just about clarifying the statistics they used to write the original ban. It’s about proving the regulatory process works. “Industry always fights the data on every single issue. Industry is always looking for a reason why it’s not their product,” said Rachel Weintraub, legislative director of the Consumer Federation of America. “As a society, where do we want to place that burden?”And Robert Adler, a CPSC commissioner since 2009, fears the future could prove even more dangerous, especially as new retailers swoop in to the now-regulation-free market. “The hazards of this product have not disappeared, and if recent information is correct, the hazard is extremely likely to grow significantly as new firms enter the magnet market,” Adler said at the March hearing. Wolfson, the former agency spokesman, put it more bluntly: “For anyone to raise doubts about the risk to children is disrespecting families that suffered incredible trauma, seeing children rushed into surgery, children after surgery continuing to be hooked up to different monitors and fed intravenously because their small intestines are so damaged.”After his long, single-minded fight against the CPSC, Qu wonders if all the time and money might have been better spent on something else ― public awareness campaigns, perhaps, or child-proof packaging. The magnet balls are still magnet balls, and they’re dangerous or they’re not, depending on your perspective. One thing, though, is clear: Qu may have been the last man standing in the fight against the CPSC, but he’s no longer alone in selling the novelty products. Magnet vendors from overseas have flooded the online market, selling products that appear to be similar and often seem to come with no warnings at all.While CPSC staffers are now back at work trying to figure out if a new, revised regulation to stop future sales of the high-powered magnets is something the agency should one day adopt, the market is once again open. But the lawsuit against Qu to force him to recall his old magnets continues. Following Qu’s March 2016 victory in front of the administrative law judge, the commission filed its appeal.In early June of this year, Qu, his lawyer and a large group of observers from the CPSC converged on a hearing room in an office tower in Bethesda, Maryland, to hear arguments. No one quite knew what was going to happen. There hadn’t been an appeal like this in decades, and the kinks were still being worked out. The presentations began. The CPSC said the dangers of magnets were clear to everyone by now, and the law was clear too: “We don’t need a body count” to take action, said the CPSC’s lawyer. Qu’s lawyer, in response, played a video, called “Childhood Wonder,” that showed Qu constructing sculptures with his magnets. The hearing ended after two hours. Qu left, unsure of his fate.But he’s vowed to keep pressing his case ― and selling magnets. Qu originally thought he would hedge his bets. In February, he helped launch Speks, a new brand of “compliance magnets” that meet the now-vacated CPSC safety standard. They aren’t as strong as Zen Magnets and can’t make the same types of fantastic shapes, but they seem to make people happy. And he has an unexpected new partner in the venture: Craig Zucker. With the help of Zucker’s old contacts, Speks are already appearing in stores across the country, raising the prospects of a lucrative future. (Zucker enthusiastically claims sales are at “close to Buckyballs levels.”) But recently, Qu decided to significantly reduce his role in the arrangement. Speks, he said, was taking too much time away from the thing he really loves: super-strong Zen Magnets.Qu hopes the magnet era will come roaring back, but whether it is already over remains to be seen. At the June hearing, Qu listened intently, his hands moving restlessly in his lap. But he wasn’t playing with magnets. He was whirling a fidget spinner, the hottest toy of 2017.

The first allegation came out in September 2016 and Nassar was subsequently fired from USA Gymnastics and his faculty position at Michigan State University. He plead guilty in July to three federal counts relating to child pornography and is currently in jail awaiting trial on multiple other lawsuits.The allegations follow a similar narrative: Nassar reportedly gained a young athlete and her family’s trust and then continually abused her by fondling and penetrating her with his fingers ― all under the guise of medical care. Many of these athletes ― some as young as 12 years old ― were treated by Nassar for years. In a recent conversation with The Guardian, Raisman condemned USA Gymnastics for the organization’s negligence and called Nassar a “monster.” “I feel like there’s a lot of articles about it, but nobody has said, ‘This is horrible, this is what we’re doing to change,’” she told The Guardian.Raisman, who worked with Nassar in the past, pointed out just how terrifying it was to realize there was an alleged serial predator in the tight knit gymnastics community. “What people don’t realize is that this doctor was a doctor for 29 years. Whether or not he did it to a gymnast, they still knew him. Even if he didn’t do it to you, it’s still the trauma and the anxiety of wondering what could have happened. I think that needs to be addressed,” she said. “These girls, they should be comfortable going to USA Gymnastics and saying ‘I need help, I want therapy. I need this.’”She added that USA Gymnastics needs to do much better. “Everyone is important,” Raisman said. “It doesn’t matter if you’re the Olympic champion or you’re an 8-year-old that goes to gymnastics in Ohio, or wherever you are in the U.S. Every single kid is important and I want USA Gymnastics to do a better job with that.” USA Gymnastics responded to Raisman’s criticisms in a statement sent to HuffPost:Aly is one of our most-decorated athletes and has served as an athlete leader and the captain of two Olympic teams. We welcome her passion on this critical issue. As we have said, we are appalled by the conduct of which Larry Nassar is accused. And, we are sorry that any athlete has been harmed during her or his gymnastics career.Head over to The Guardian to read the rest of Raisman’s thoughts on Nassar. "

Trapero said he could not confirm who was driving, but said investigators believed only one person was in the van.Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack, in which a van traveling at high-speed drove through crowds of tourists and local people walking along Las Ramblas, leaving a trail of dead and 120 injured from 34 countries.Hours later, police shot dead five men wearing fake explosive belts in the Catalan seaside resort of Cambrils after they rammed holidaymakers with a car and stabbed others, killing one woman.A police source in France told Reuters on Friday that police there had been looking for the driver of a white Renault Kangoo van that may be connected to the attacks. French media said on Saturday the vehicle had been found near Barcelona.Abouyaaqoub’s mother Hannou Ghanimi, speaking to reporters, urged her son to give himself up to police, saying she preferred him being in prison to being dead.The attacks were the deadliest in Spain for more than a decade. In little more than a year, militants have used vehicles as weapons to kill nearly 130 people in France, Germany, Britain, Sweden and Spain.Four people have been arrested so far in connection with the attacks - three Moroccans and a citizen of Spain’s North African enclave of Melilla.PYRENEAN CONNECTIONOne focus of the investigation is on Ripoll, a quiet town set beneath the Pyrenees mountain range and ringed by forested hills, which was the home of a number of the youths, most of Moroccan nationality, who are suspected of involvement. Three of those killed in Cambrils were aged between 17 and 24.A common thread running through the young men’s lives was a local imam, Abdelbaki Es Satty, whose landlord said he left Ripoll two days before the attack.Spanish media have depicted Es Satty as being a possible ring-leader who indoctrinated the group.Papers bearing what appeared to be French names, phone numbers and e-mail addresses were seen by reporters in Es Satty’s apartment in Ripoll after it was searched by police.A police document published by Spanish media said two alleged members of the group, Youssef Aallaa and Mohamed Hichamy, now both believed dead, had traveled to Zurich in December 2016.Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger said Swiss police confirmed that at least one of the Barcelona suspects had been in Zurich in December 2016, although it said it was not yet possible to say if the suspects had any connections to Switzerland. An investigation of the visit was under way, it said.Trapero said investigators have identified two people from remains found in a house razed in an explosion on Wednesday in Alcanar, southwest of Barcelona, that police believe the suspects were using as a base.Police believe the explosion foiled the cell’s plans to carry out one or more large-scale bombings in Barcelona and led them to rush to stage attacks with vehicles.More than 100 butane gas cylinders were found at the house, and also, according to Spanish media, traces of TATP, or triacetone triperoxide, a highly volatile explosive nicknamed “the mother of Satan” that can be made with easily obtainable household chemicals.Of the 14 dead in the two attacks, five are Spanish, two are Italians, two are Portuguese, one Belgian, one Canadian and one a U.S. citizen, emergency services and authorities from those countries have confirmed so far.Spain’s King Felipe and Queen Letizia, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa joined Catalan leaders on Sunday for a service in memory of the victims of the attack at Barcelona’s towering Sagrada Familia church, one of the city’s landmarks designed by architect Antoni Gaudi.Spain has kept its security alert level at four, one notch below the maximum level that would indicate another attack was imminent, but said it would reinforce security in crowded areas and tourist hotspots.(Additional reporting by Sarah White, Julien Toyer, Adrian Croft, Rodrigo de Miguel, Alba Asenjo and John Miller in Zurich; Writing by Adrian Croft; Editing by Julien Toyer and Janet Lawrence)"

Kara, responding to controversy over Donald Trump's Charlottesville comments, told The Jerusalem Post last week that Israelis ""must not accept anyone harming” Trump. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/599999431e00003c00c5e792.jpeg?cache=vgHQiPfoWf&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As anger mounted in Israel last week over President Donald Trump’s ― and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s ― response to the white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, the country’s communications minister urged Israelis to prioritize their support for Trump over their denunciation of neo-Nazis.Speaking to The Jerusalem Post on Thursday, Ayoub Kara, who was handpicked for his ministerial role by Netanyahu in May, said that Israel must defend Trump, who he described as the “best U.S. leader Israel has ever had.”“Due to the terrific relations with the U.S., we need to put the declarations about the Nazis in the proper proportion,” said Kara, who is a member of the Druze community, a non-Jewish minority in Israel. “We need to condemn anti-Semitism and any trace of Nazism, and I will do what I can as a minister to stop its spread. But Trump is the best U.S. leader Israel has ever had. His relations with the prime minister of Israel are wonderful, and after enduring the terrible years of Obama, Trump is the unquestioned leader of the free world, and we must not accept anyone harming him.”Kara’s comments were made on the same day as the publication of several front-page stories in Israeli newspapers deploring Trump’s Charlottesville comments and Netanyahu’s lack of response to them. Yedioth Ahronoth, a popular Hebrew newspaper, had a photo of Trump on its front page with a single word: “SHAME.”  “Trump defends neo-Nazi marchers, shocking America,” read Haaretz’s front page. Ma’ariv, another popular Hebrew newspaper, bore the headline “Presidential embrace of the far-right,” accompanying a photograph of Trump.Trump has come under fire for saying that “many sides” were to blame for the deadly Charlottesville demonstrations and that there were “very fine people on both sides.” Netanyahu has similarly been censured in Israel for his tepid response to the white supremacist demonstrations. The Israeli prime minister posted a non-specific tweet conveying outrage at “expressions of anti-Semitism, neo-Nazism and racism,” but he did so only three days after the rally occurred. He has also not responded to Trump’s comments ― to the chagrin of many Israeli politicians and commentators. “The man has lost any semblance of a moral compass,” Stav Shaffir, an opposition lawmaker, wrote of Netanyahu in a Haaretz op-ed this week. Though the prime minister has mostly kept his silence, his son, Yair Netanyahu, made headlines last week for his own take on Charlottesville. Echoing Trump in a post on Facebook, Yair appeared to equate what he referred to as neo-Nazi “scum” with leftist “thugs of Antifa and [Black Lives Matter].”“To put things in perspective. I’m a Jew, I’m an Israeli, the neo nazis scums in Virginia hate me and my country. But they belong to the past. Their breed is dying out,” the 26-year-old said. “However the thugs of Antifa and BLM who hate my country (and America too in my view) just as much are getting stronger and stronger and becoming super dominant in American universities and public life.”"

You can’t even gestate a baby that fast. And the anti-Semitic chants from the Charlottesville protesters won’t stop banging around in my mind. Nor will the face of Heather Heyer, who died trying to make the world a less hateful place.And all this comes on top of the grim climate change report and the realization that our Commander in Chief was invited by his frenemy Kim Jong Un to play a rousing game of real-life Battleship.Woof. It’s a lot.So much, actually, that I think I’ve cycled through the five stages of grief, all the fight/flight/freeze responses, sleeplessness, anxiety, mild constipation (joke), and I’m finally getting a grip and realizing that after all that, I’m oddly inspired. I’m not talking about the traditional feel-good, slow-mo-through-the-finish-line motivational poster kind of inspiring, but it’s sincerely rousing nevertheless.I mean, what a world we live in! One that is so fraught with opportunity to be better. In fact, it’s pretty extraordinary how we’ve managed to create a reality where even with the most minimal effort, tomorrow could be better than today. That’s exciting! If you think about it, it’s like someone is holding the leg of a superhero suit, ready for us to step in.Friends, we’re being served a revolution on a silver platter, and it’s time for us to devour it.I totally get that a piping hot dish served with perfect presentation warrants a pearl clutch and begs a perfectly filtered Instagram photo, but we don’t have that kind of time. We can’t sit around lamenting our failure for letting it get to this point. We can’t fear that our engagement must be perfectly polite. We can’t let timid silence, petrified perfectionism or our own shrinking sense of safety be the end of us.We all must act.Now, not all actions have to be as bold and direct as marching in the streets (although that’s powerful, too). Meaningful engagement can be smiling more at strangers, making it known that you’re someone others need not fear. It can be supporting the organizations doing the work on the frontlines to eradicate hate and lobby for environmental protections. Or Googling reading lists that will help you understand how racism, homophobia, anti-Semitism and other isms really affect the others’ lives. It can mean speaking up when you hear or see discrimination. Not trying or pretending to be colorblind, which denies people their lived experiences and oftentimes their culture and heritage. Teaching your kids how to find commonalities and simultaneously how to celebrate differences. It could even be attending someone else’s church instead of always your own. It’s listening. And it’s always (always!) voting.If there is one thing I’ve noticed, it’s that the intensity of our public discourse heightens as we divide, probably because we have to be so much louder to be heard from so far away. But, when we increase the volume instead of decreasing the distance, we fuel the ignorance-inspired hatred that’s tearing through our communities leaving bodies in its wake.The terror must end. And we must stop it. Because in a world with such an abundance of love and determination to eradicate that which infects our deepest human instincts to take care of one another, I know we can and will rise up.So, wash your leggings and press your cape; it’s go time."

The group intends to mail the diplomas to Falwell’s office on Sept. 5, and it also seeks his removal as the school’s president. The letter on the group’s Facebook page says Falwell, son of the university’s founder, has failed to condemn “things which are patently against the religion he and LU claim.”Those actions, the letter says, “have filled us with shame and anger as alums.”“I think all of the alumni have been troubled by Jerry Falwell Jr.’s intense defense of Trump,” Hamann said.Fellow 2006 graduate Chris Gaumer, who’s a former LU Student Government Association president, echoed that sentiment to HuffPost on Sunday, He called Trump’s comments “disgusting and abhorrent.”“It doesn’t really get too much more important than this,” he said of standing up against the hate groups.In an earlier interview with NPR, Gaumer said that in siding with Trump, Falwell was siding with Nazi and white supremacist sympathizers. That makes him “and it seems to me, the university he represents, complicit,” said Gaumer, who resides in Lynchburg.Falwell defended his words, as well as those of Trump, during an appearance on ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday. Falwell suggested that Trump laid blame to both sides in the Charlottesville clashes because he “has inside information.”Some of those protesting, Falwell suggested, may have been “historical purists” who were upset about the efforts of Charlottesville officials to remove from a park a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.He also noted that as part of his commentary on the Charlottesville violence, Trump had labeled as “evil” white supremacists, neo-Nazis and Ku Klux Klan members.Falwell waved off the alumni protest, saying his support for Trump, which included an endorsement during his presidential campaign, is misunderstood.“One of the reasons why I supported him is because he doesn’t say what’s politically correct,” and “he’s not focus-grouping every word he says,” Falwell said. “My support for the president is his bold and truthful willingness to call terrorist groups by their real names, and that’s something we haven’t seen by presidents in recent years.”Hamann snapped back at that assessment, saying such praise for someone being politically incorrect without concern over the possible repercussions is “just so troubling.”“That can’t be your world view,” she said."

That might not change much.",2017-08-20,"President Donald Trump shakes hands with John Kelly after he was sworn in as White House Chief of Staff in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, U.S., July 31, 2017",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5999fa8f1e00002700c5e80d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON – John Kelly led tens of thousands of Marines in Iraq’s treacherous Anbar Province, was in charge of the entire U.S. military presence in Central and South America, yet now may have come across someone even he cannot manage:The guy in the West Wing office a few steps away from his, the president of the United States.Three weeks into the former Marine general’s tenure as White House chief of staff, Donald Trump had among his most disastrous spells yet since taking office in January, going off-script for a 15-minute, impromptu news conference in which he equated Nazis and KKK members with the protesters opposing them in Charlottesville, Virginia. That followed a week in which Trump issued statements on Twitter that seemed to threaten a nuclear attack on North Korea, which followed a week in which he fabricated laudatory phone conversations with the president of Mexico and the leader of the Boy Scouts.Kelly defenders say it is too soon to assess his effectiveness, and point to his success in ousting alt-right media executive Stephen Bannon from a top White House job – possibly enabling the Trump White House to end intra-party fights with Republicans in Congress and elsewhere.“He was far too undisciplined, selfish and irresponsible to hold a senior post in the White House,” said Matt Mackowiak, a GOP consultant and chair of the Travis County Republican party in Austin, Texas. “This is a positive step but it doesn’t completely solve their problems.”Others, including those who know Kelly from his 40-year military career, are skeptical. In his leadership roles in the Marines, Kelly had full authority to accomplish his missions. And while Kelly has been granted full authority over White House staff, that does not give him the ability to address the root cause of the administration’s dysfunction, critics said, which is Trump himself.“He will be able to manage down and across the White House,” said one retired Army general who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the commander-in-chief. “But the challenge will be up.”Kelly started his new job July 31, and immediately fired Anthony Scaramucci, a hedge fund manager whom Trump had hired as communications director just days earlier, over an obscenity filled interview he gave The New Yorker magazine. Scaramucci’s arrival had precipitated the departure of original chief of staff Reince Priebus and press secretary Sean Spicer, both of whom had advised Trump against the hire. Both Priebus and Spicer had been with the Republican National Committee and had played key roles in Trump’s campaign after he won the nomination.The net effect is that three of Trump’s top advisers from his first six months have left the White House in a matter of weeks – effectively cutting his ties with the supporters who put him in the Oval Office.“He is now untethered from the political structure that got him to the White House ― Reince was his tie to the establishment, Bannon to the base. He has neither,” said a top RNC member who spoke on condition of anonymity. “While I have never been a big fan of Bannon, this is going to hurt Trump and his presidency.”The potential political consequences of these staff changes, though, are likely of minimal interest to Kelly. His military career was, of necessity, largely apolitical, although he did for a period serve as a congressional liaison.Rather, his mission has been to make the White House function more normally, with more structure and an established process for interacting with Trump. To that end, he has inserted himself as the gatekeeper to the president’s schedule, both in person and via telephone.Yet this process does not block Trump from reaching out on his own to whomever he wants for advice – and it clearly has not stopped him from issuing statements via Twitter, as he did Thursday, when he defended Confederate monuments using the same language white supremacist groups have used for decades, or Friday, when he attacked Republican senators whose votes he will need in coming legislation.“There’s a limit to what Kelly can control,” Mackowiak said. “And within that universe, he’s done reasonably well so far.”That Kelly is having trouble modifying Trump’s behavior should not have come as a surprise.Having taken over a family business four decades ago worth $1 billion in today’s dollars, Trump has almost never in his adult life been forced to do something he didn’t want to do. The one exception was in the 1990s and 2000s, when the failure of his casinos put him on the brink of personal bankruptcy. His bankers forced him to unload his money-losing airline, his 282-foot motor yacht, his personal jetliner, and put him on a spending allowance.From that point forward, including his primary and general election campaigns, Trump has largely done whatever he has wanted, even when the consequences have been damaging. Last October, for example, during a visit to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, to lay out a concrete agenda for the first 100 days of his presidency, Trump opened the speech by promising to sue every woman who had come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against him.Mackowiak said Trump’s biggest problems are those he has generated himself. “It just doesn’t make any sense,” he said, adding that Kelly, to be successful, will need to persuade Trump of that. “The best-case scenario is that he’s shown that a different approach would be more successful.”"
10,POLITICS,Bad Jobs And No Welfare Give Rise To A New Type Of Charity: The Diaper Bank,Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/diaper-banks-child-poverty_us_5983538ae4b00f0084ae8687,A network of diaper banks now alleviates some of the suffering caused by the 1996 gutting of welfare.,2017-08-20,"Diapers and baby formula are donated during the annual Christmas Collection at the Charles County Children's Aid Society in Waldorf, Maryland.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5983636a15000021008b4f06.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― When Avaye Armstrong got pregnant almost two years ago, she had a job waiting tables at a Buffalo Wild Wings. She enjoyed the work and it paid well on game nights. Armstrong, her daughter and her boyfriend were living with his mother at the time, not far from the restaurant.  Like most companies, Buffalo Wild Wings didn’t offer paid maternity leave. But a manager told Armstrong she could return to her job after the baby was born, whenever she was ready. She tried to go back after less than six weeks ― before doctors generally advise new moms to return to work ― but she realized she missed her new baby boy too much. “I wasn’t fully ready,” said the 21-year-old. She decided to stay home after that.Losing her income was a big hit for the family. Armstrong and her boyfriend relied on their parents to afford basic necessities. Sometimes they ran low on diapers ― among the more expensive needs of newborns ― and they would delay changing the baby if the diaper was just wet. This could be miserable for the baby ― and was also hard on Armstrong.“I’m his mom,” she said. “He’s depending on me, and I can’t even get a diaper.”Armstrong’s story highlights the heavy burdens of parenthood in America and points to a gaping hole in our social safety net. Diapers are perhaps its clearest symbol.New moms and dads must chose between quitting their jobs and raising their children on a severely diminished income, like Armstrong did, or continuing to work, paying someone else to take care of their children and still risking punishment for insufficient devotion to their employer. Whatever your income level, parenthood pulls you away from the workplace and could set you on a path to poverty. For too many parents struggling to pay the bills, there’s no government backstop to help meet their families’ non-food needs. The problem has only grown worse since President Bill Clinton signed “welfare reform” into law in 1996.This gap in the social safety net has given rise to a new charitable institution in America: the diaper bank. The first U.S. diaper bank opened in Tucson, Arizona, in 2000, after several years of volunteer-driven holiday diaper drives. In the last 17 years, hundreds more have been established across the country, distributing millions of diapers to families in need.But diaper bank directors say there’s more need than they can cover, and lawmakers aren’t ready to help. Quite the opposite, in fact: The remaining safety net programs, which mitigate a tremendous amount of suffering, are under constant siege from Republicans using Clinton’s welfare reform as a template. “The truth is we do not have a social safety net to speak of for many, many Americans,” said Joanne Goldblum, director of the National Diaper Bank Network.Babies pee and poop a lot. Newborns can go through as many as 10 diapers a day, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics, and 3,000 diapers in their first year. Disposable diapers for one baby cost between $70 and $125 a month ― that’s a lot when you’re poor.  Roughly 21 percent of children under age 5 live in poverty, according to the most recent Census data, which amounts to more than 4 million kids. Among households that bought diapers in 2015, those in the bottom fifth of the income distribution ― with average annual income of $11,279 ― spent about 10 percent of that income on diapers, according to a HuffPost analysis of the most recent data on consumer expenditures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Our analysis updates previous research by the Center for Economic and Policy Research, which found a similarly grim picture. In a 2013 study examining “diaper need,” roughly 27 percent of parents reported worrying about whether they had enough diapers to change their children as often as they would like. Of those, 10 percent said they asked friends for help and 8 percent said they delayed changing a wet diaper. Changing diapers regularly is crucial to keeping babies comfortable, happy and ideally not crying. It’s also a health issue. A wet diaper can increase an infant’s risk of dermatitis and urinary tract infections ― which in turn can force parents to miss work for doctor visits. Not being able to change a baby’s diapers often enough also stresses the parents, which can affect the whole family. Multiple studies have shown that children of stressed parents are at greater risk of developing emotional, social and behavioral problems. “Diaper need was the most predictive of postpartum depressive symptoms, above and beyond food insecurity, housing instability, other demographic variables like race and ethnicity,” said Megan Smith, an associate professor at the Yale School of Medicine and lead author of the 2013 study, which was conducted in New Haven, Connecticut.It makes sense that lacking Huggies can bring you down. If you can’t even keep your child clean, Smith said, “It really interferes with that bond, that attachment between you and your child.″ Charities have probably given out diapers since diapers existed, but diaper-specific organizations are a recent phenomenon.  In 1993, Hildy Gottlieb founded a consulting firm that advised nonprofits in Tucson. After a successful first year, she and her colleagues brainstormed ways of giving back to the community. “One of the gals said, ‘Why don’t we bring a bunch of diapers to the local crisis nursery?’” Gottlieb recalled, referring to a kind of emergency family shelter. “What if we called it a diaper drive and put out a press release?”So they did. They looped in a local radio station and within just the four weeks before Christmas in 1994, they collected more than 20,000 diapers. The next year, they did it again and delivered even more diapers. The program taught Gottlieb quite a bit about diaper need. “If a family, for instance, can’t afford the diapers to leave at daycare, they can’t leave their child at daycare,” she said. “It is a domino that can cascade absolutely everything else.”In 2000, Gottlieb cofounded the Diaper Bank of Southern Arizona ― the first in America. Last year, more than 300 similar organizations distributed 50 million diapers to more than 200,000 children nationwide. It might be tempting to think of diaper banks as a shining example of civil society stepping forward to solve a problem that the government couldn’t, but there’s not much reason to think even this formidable effort matches the scale of the problem. “The need is much greater than what we can currently do,” said Dan Moxley, the current director of the Diaper Bank of Southern Arizona. Census data show more than 17,000 children under 5 live in poverty in Pima County. His diaper bank distributes a small fraction of what those kids need, even when the goal is merely to supplement the parents’ supply. “If we were to provide 50 diapers a month to all [the kids who need them], that would be 9 million diapers a year,” Moxley said. “We distribute 1 million.” Joanne Goldblum was a social worker in Connecticut when the deprivation she saw among her clients prompted her to establish a diaper bank in New Haven in 2004. “I would drive a mile from my house, drop my kids off at a great school, and I would go into people’s homes that didn’t have heat or hot water,” she said. “I would go into people’s homes that were so overwhelmingly difficult for them to manage because they had not just no money, but no access to the things that you need: diapers, toilet paper, tampons, house cleaning supplies.”Goldblum became obsessed with the question of how people with no money kept themselves and their children clean. “As a sort of middle class woman, I can complain bitterly about how stressful my life is ― ‘How am I ever going to manage to get everything done?’” she said. “And that’s with the ability to pay all my bills, with a partner who is helpful and present, with cars, cell phones, all those things.”Goldblum said she was surprised to learn that no federal program helped with non-food necessities like diapers. She was aware of the Diaper Bank of Southern Arizona, so she and her husband grabbed some friends, went to the supermarket, bought a bunch of diapers and launched The Diaper Bank in New Haven. She founded the National Diaper Bank Network six years later, with an investment from Kimberly-Clark, the consumer products company that makes Huggies. The National Diaper Bank Network connects local diaper banks and assists people who want to start new ones. Visitors to the website can get help finding a local diaper bank, donating unused diapers or starting a diaper drive. Diaper banks have caught on not only because babies are a very sympathetic demographic, but because the idea of diaper need helps people understand on a visceral level what poverty really means, said Goldblum.“As a society we think of poverty in a very conceptual, very high level of thinking,” she said. “We don’t think about how it means there’s a family who lives in my town that can’t afford a clean diaper for their kid, and they’re not going to be able to go to work today if they don’t have a clean diaper.”The federal government runs two big programs that help low-income people pay for medical care and food ― Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), respectively. The government also funds an array of programs that help smaller shares of poor people afford rent, utilities, phone service, even baby formula. But there’s nothing that specifically covers diapers or other household necessities like toilet paper or toothpaste.Democrats and even some Republicans have proposed broadening eligibility for the Earned Income Tax Credit and other credits that help working parents offset the costs of raising children. Some legislative proposals would increase the value of the refunds and even distribute them more often than once per year, which would make planning and paying for day-to-day expenses easier. Of course, tax credits don’t help parents with little or no earned income, since you have to owe income tax to receive refunds.Unlike the U.S., other economically advanced nations tend to throw money at new parents through what’s called a “child benefit” or “child allowance.” In most European countries, the allowance is universal, meaning rich and poor parents alike receive a monthly cash allotment. The U.S. runs a similar program for the elderly: Social Security. It turns out that giving poor parents money is a good way to reduce childhood poverty. A host of studies in Europe and the U.S. show that countries that provide child benefits have lower child poverty rates and indicate that such a program would have similar results here. Democrats have seized specifically on the inability of some parents to afford diapers and since at least 2015 have pushed legislation that would test the feasibility of a nationwide diaper voucher program. But the measure is a non-starter on Capitol Hill, where Republicans generally assume that poor people are already taken care of by existing programs. Nobody articulated this view more succinctly than Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in 2012.“I’m not concerned about the very poor,” Romney told CNN. “We have a safety net there.”It would be more accurate to say we used to have a safety net there. The federal government once gave poor parents money through a program known as Aid to Families with Dependent Children. Congress and President Franklin D. Roosevelt created the program in the wake of the Great Depression. It operated as an entitlement, meaning anyone whose income was low enough could receive cash, with no work requirements or limits on the number of people who could enroll.Congress dismantled that program as part of welfare reform in 1996. Amid a racially tinged furor over welfare’s alleged contribution to the moral decay of the poor, Republicans argued that it disincentivized work and marriage. In its place, lawmakers created the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which still provides cash but allows states to decide how much and to set time limits on benefits. TANF’s funding level hasn’t budged in two decades, meaning the actual value of its benefits has steadily eroded with inflation. Sixty-eight percent of impoverished families with children received welfare benefits in 1996 (before the new law kicked in), according to the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. By 2014, that number had plummeted to 23 percent. The overall number of families enrolled in the program stayed beneath 2 million even as unemployment and poverty rose sharply after the 2007 financial crash. TANF lets states be so stingy that Mississippi managed to reject more than 98 percent of applicants last year despite the state’s much-higher-than-average poverty rate. The maximum monthly cash benefit for a family of three in Mississippi is just $170.Still, welfare reform initially seemed like a success. Child poverty declined and the number of single mothers participating in the labor force increased, meaning more women were either working or looking for work instead of staying home to raise their children. “Sixty percent of mothers who left welfare found work, far surpassing predictions of experts,” former President Clinton bragged in a 2006 op-ed marking the 10th anniversary of the law. But welfare reform has not aged well. Clinton signed the law during a time of strong economic growth, which slowed down in 2002. Female labor force participation, which had been rising for decades at that point, peaked around 1999 and has fallen since. Although poverty rates have hovered between 10 and 15 percent since the 1970s, another deeper kind of deprivation has steadily increased: the number of children who live on $2 or less per day.According to research from professors Kathryn Edin of Johns Hopkins University and H. Luke Shaefer of the University of Michigan, as many as 1.5 million households had incomes of less than $2 per day per person in 2011 ― an increase of more than 100 percent since 1996. That amounts to roughly 3 million kids and more than 4 percent of all households with children.  Their initial findings were so shocking that Edin and Shaefer decided to go out and conduct field research to confirm the numbers. In a 2015 book, $2.00 a Day: Living on Almost Nothing in America, they described several cases of families getting by on less than that amount per person. Many of the mothers lost their jobs, which led to a cascade of material hardships. Rae McCormick, a single mom and two-time “cashier of the month” at a Walmart outside Cleveland, didn’t have enough gas in her truck to make it to work one day, so she said a manager told her not to bother coming back at all. That’s when her spell of $2-per-day poverty began. “In the months that followed,” Edin and Shaefer reported in their book, “Rae and [her daughter] Azara found themselves living on nothing but SNAP, plus the diaper and cigarette money slipped her now and again by her ‘grandma,’ another friend whom she and Azara live with for a time.”The instability of low-wage work has contributed to the rise of such extreme poverty. Edin and Shaefer theorize that disruption of the safety net may have actually worsened conditions by increasing the number of desperate workers, thereby giving employers more exploitive power. “Losing their job is the biggest predictor of falling into this [$2-a-day] spell,” Shaefer told HuffPost. “Work is great, and that’s what people want, but it’s just not a stable source of income.”One thing that mitigates such poverty is SNAP, previously known as the Food Stamp Program, which helped eradicate starvation in the U.S. More than 20 million households receive several hundred dollars on debit cards each month. Those funds can be used only to buy food, however, not other necessities like soap, gas or diapers.If they counted SNAP benefits as cash, Edin and Shaefer found that extreme poverty increased only 70 percent in the 15 years after welfare reform. But SNAP is not cash, a flexible resource that buys the things you need to keep your job or your shelter.  “One truism about the lives of the virtually cashless poor in this country is that they ― like anyone else living here ― just can’t manage to do without cash,” Edin and Shaefer wrote in their book. In an email, Shaefer added, “We definitely would suspect that there is a link between the rise of diaper banks and the rise of $2-a-day poverty.”It’s not just poor people who get kicked down the economic ladder when they have kids. Venessa Baez didn’t consider her family poor before she had her third child in August 2013. Both she and her husband worked full time.  Baez, who lives in Durham, North Carolina, was employed at a preschool for two years before giving birth. The job didn’t offer paid maternity leave, which is very common: In the U.S., the only economically advanced country without a national policy requiring paid maternity leave, only 13 percent of private employers give new parents paid time off. Knowing her family’s income would be cut in half after the baby came was stressful for Baez. “I had a lot of anxiety my whole pregnancy,” said the 30-year-old. Her doctor even prescribed anti-anxiety medication, she said.  After her daughter was born, Baez wanted to return to work, but it didn’t make financial sense. Her job didn’t pay much more than the cost of childcare for the baby and her 1-year-old son ― her oldest child was in school ― so Baez decided to watch the younger kids herself.Her husband worked as a cook in a restaurant. They couldn’t afford a lot of things on his income alone, including enough diapers. To make matters worse, their middle child suffered from pancreatic divisum, a condition that required a feeding tube and led him to soil more diapers than your average baby ― a dozen a day most days. They had to improvise to stretch the supply.  “When things got tough, we would use a dad-sized T-shirt,” Baez said.  The T-shirt diaper only sort of worked; urine leaked out the sides. But it helped them save diapers during the day so they had enough at night. Baez eventually enrolled her son in an Early Head Start program that provided diapers donated through the Diaper Bank of North Carolina, and in 2015 she got off a waiting list for daycare vouchers. A few months later, she was hired by a nonprofit organization that sends nurses to visit newborn babies at home. Baez’s marriage still fell apart. The final economic stressor, she said, was when a credit card company closed her husband’s account because of nonpayment. “That was our biggest factor of why we aren’t together,” she said. “We had a lot of mounting bills we couldn’t pay.” Baez’s family is like many others that the Diaper Bank of North Carolina helps. Most diaper banks distribute their supplies through partner organizations. “If a family is struggling for diapers, they more than likely are struggling with other needs and we want them to be connected to programs that can help them with those needs,” said Michelle Old, who founded the North Carolina nonprofit out of her house in 2013. “The needs can vary from help in purchasing a car seat, food assistance, utility assistance and parenting classes.”Three-quarters of the parents who received diapers from Old’s organization said they had jobs, according to a study that Old co-authored this year, and even larger percentages said they qualified for food stamps and other safety net benefits. Roughly 1 in 5 said they’ve used diapers that were the wrong size, and nearly 30 percent said they’d delayed a change. “Families are making really tough choices between buying food or buying diapers, and every single time, they’re gonna choose to feed their children, and they’re gonna try to make those diapers last as long as they can,” Old said. Avaye Armstrong, the former Buffalo Wild Wings server, now has a reliable supply of diapers thanks to the DC Diaper Bank, which through partner organizations provides more than 150,000 a month to more than 3,000 families. But Armstrong’s diaper situation improved only after everything else got worse.  The living arrangement with her boyfriend’s mother lasted just two months after the baby was born, before the intergenerational crowding became too stressful for everyone. Now Armstrong and her family live in a family homeless shelter run by the D.C. city government in a former hospital building. She receives a donated pack of diapers and wipes every week. But the hospital building is notoriously unsafe and literally falling apart. Armstrong and several other moms said they can hear raccoons crawling around in the ceiling at night. “You can hear them stepping,” Armstrong said on a bench outside the shelter, her baby boy eating pieces of fruit in his stroller. “It’s so disgusting.”D.C. General Hospital was originally founded two hundred years ago as the city’s poorhouse ― a now-obsolete institution thanks largely to Social Security’s monthly benefits, available to nearly everybody once they reach a certain age. Today, the poverty rate for senior citizens is less than half that for children under 18, which is nearly 20 percent. In an alternate universe with a child allowance for all American parents, experts say there would be a lot fewer poor kids. A 2016 Century Foundation report analyzed just how much child poverty could be reduced by different levels of benefits: A $2,500 annual allowance, for instance, would bring the rate down to about 11 percent. The nation’s capital might have fewer homeless families, and maybe not have turned a hospital back into a poorhouse, if local moms weren’t going broke as soon as their kids were born. Armstrong wants to study nursing, one of America’s faster-growing occupations and one that can provide a middle-class income for people with less than a bachelor’s degree. But she’s pregnant again, with the inevitable economic challenges ahead. She still needs to find reliable childcare and housing.“I want to go back to school and finish everything, and they can have their funky-ass welfare check and food stamps. It’s like, ugh, I gotta depend on the government,” she said. “I know me: I’m not the type of person to not work.”Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

11,POLITICS,Bad Jobs And No Welfare Give Rise To A New Type Of Charity: The Diaper Bank,Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/diaper-banks-child-poverty_us_5983538ae4b00f0084ae8687,A network of diaper banks now alleviates some of the suffering caused by the 1996 gutting of welfare.,2017-08-20,"President Bill Clinton signs into law a welfare reform bill ending the 61-year federal guarantee of aid to the poor on Aug. 22, 1996.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5983735b210000a31afca0b1.jpeg?ops=crop_6_39_2888_1790%2Cscalefit_1280_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― When Avaye Armstrong got pregnant almost two years ago, she had a job waiting tables at a Buffalo Wild Wings. She enjoyed the work and it paid well on game nights. Armstrong, her daughter and her boyfriend were living with his mother at the time, not far from the restaurant.  Like most companies, Buffalo Wild Wings didn’t offer paid maternity leave. But a manager told Armstrong she could return to her job after the baby was born, whenever she was ready. She tried to go back after less than six weeks ― before doctors generally advise new moms to return to work ― but she realized she missed her new baby boy too much. “I wasn’t fully ready,” said the 21-year-old. She decided to stay home after that.Losing her income was a big hit for the family. Armstrong and her boyfriend relied on their parents to afford basic necessities. Sometimes they ran low on diapers ― among the more expensive needs of newborns ― and they would delay changing the baby if the diaper was just wet. This could be miserable for the baby ― and was also hard on Armstrong.“I’m his mom,” she said. “He’s depending on me, and I can’t even get a diaper.”Armstrong’s story highlights the heavy burdens of parenthood in America and points to a gaping hole in our social safety net. Diapers are perhaps its clearest symbol.New moms and dads must chose between quitting their jobs and raising their children on a severely diminished income, like Armstrong did, or continuing to work, paying someone else to take care of their children and still risking punishment for insufficient devotion to their employer. Whatever your income level, parenthood pulls you away from the workplace and could set you on a path to poverty. For too many parents struggling to pay the bills, there’s no government backstop to help meet their families’ non-food needs. The problem has only grown worse since President Bill Clinton signed “welfare reform” into law in 1996.This gap in the social safety net has given rise to a new charitable institution in America: the diaper bank. The first U.S. diaper bank opened in Tucson, Arizona, in 2000, after several years of volunteer-driven holiday diaper drives. In the last 17 years, hundreds more have been established across the country, distributing millions of diapers to families in need.But diaper bank directors say there’s more need than they can cover, and lawmakers aren’t ready to help. Quite the opposite, in fact: The remaining safety net programs, which mitigate a tremendous amount of suffering, are under constant siege from Republicans using Clinton’s welfare reform as a template. “The truth is we do not have a social safety net to speak of for many, many Americans,” said Joanne Goldblum, director of the National Diaper Bank Network.Babies pee and poop a lot.

Edin and Shaefer theorize that disruption of the safety net may have actually worsened conditions by increasing the number of desperate workers, thereby giving employers more exploitive power. “Losing their job is the biggest predictor of falling into this [$2-a-day] spell,” Shaefer told HuffPost. “Work is great, and that’s what people want, but it’s just not a stable source of income.”One thing that mitigates such poverty is SNAP, previously known as the Food Stamp Program, which helped eradicate starvation in the U.S. More than 20 million households receive several hundred dollars on debit cards each month. Those funds can be used only to buy food, however, not other necessities like soap, gas or diapers.If they counted SNAP benefits as cash, Edin and Shaefer found that extreme poverty increased only 70 percent in the 15 years after welfare reform. But SNAP is not cash, a flexible resource that buys the things you need to keep your job or your shelter.  “One truism about the lives of the virtually cashless poor in this country is that they ― like anyone else living here ― just can’t manage to do without cash,” Edin and Shaefer wrote in their book. In an email, Shaefer added, “We definitely would suspect that there is a link between the rise of diaper banks and the rise of $2-a-day poverty.”It’s not just poor people who get kicked down the economic ladder when they have kids. Venessa Baez didn’t consider her family poor before she had her third child in August 2013. Both she and her husband worked full time.  Baez, who lives in Durham, North Carolina, was employed at a preschool for two years before giving birth. The job didn’t offer paid maternity leave, which is very common: In the U.S., the only economically advanced country without a national policy requiring paid maternity leave, only 13 percent of private employers give new parents paid time off. Knowing her family’s income would be cut in half after the baby came was stressful for Baez. “I had a lot of anxiety my whole pregnancy,” said the 30-year-old. Her doctor even prescribed anti-anxiety medication, she said.  After her daughter was born, Baez wanted to return to work, but it didn’t make financial sense. Her job didn’t pay much more than the cost of childcare for the baby and her 1-year-old son ― her oldest child was in school ― so Baez decided to watch the younger kids herself.Her husband worked as a cook in a restaurant. They couldn’t afford a lot of things on his income alone, including enough diapers. To make matters worse, their middle child suffered from pancreatic divisum, a condition that required a feeding tube and led him to soil more diapers than your average baby ― a dozen a day most days. They had to improvise to stretch the supply.  “When things got tough, we would use a dad-sized T-shirt,” Baez said.  The T-shirt diaper only sort of worked; urine leaked out the sides. But it helped them save diapers during the day so they had enough at night. Baez eventually enrolled her son in an Early Head Start program that provided diapers donated through the Diaper Bank of North Carolina, and in 2015 she got off a waiting list for daycare vouchers. A few months later, she was hired by a nonprofit organization that sends nurses to visit newborn babies at home. Baez’s marriage still fell apart. The final economic stressor, she said, was when a credit card company closed her husband’s account because of nonpayment. “That was our biggest factor of why we aren’t together,” she said. “We had a lot of mounting bills we couldn’t pay.” Baez’s family is like many others that the Diaper Bank of North Carolina helps. Most diaper banks distribute their supplies through partner organizations. “If a family is struggling for diapers, they more than likely are struggling with other needs and we want them to be connected to programs that can help them with those needs,” said Michelle Old, who founded the North Carolina nonprofit out of her house in 2013. “The needs can vary from help in purchasing a car seat, food assistance, utility assistance and parenting classes.”Three-quarters of the parents who received diapers from Old’s organization said they had jobs, according to a study that Old co-authored this year, and even larger percentages said they qualified for food stamps and other safety net benefits. Roughly 1 in 5 said they’ve used diapers that were the wrong size, and nearly 30 percent said they’d delayed a change. “Families are making really tough choices between buying food or buying diapers, and every single time, they’re gonna choose to feed their children, and they’re gonna try to make those diapers last as long as they can,” Old said. Avaye Armstrong, the former Buffalo Wild Wings server, now has a reliable supply of diapers thanks to the DC Diaper Bank, which through partner organizations provides more than 150,000 a month to more than 3,000 families. But Armstrong’s diaper situation improved only after everything else got worse.  The living arrangement with her boyfriend’s mother lasted just two months after the baby was born, before the intergenerational crowding became too stressful for everyone. Now Armstrong and her family live in a family homeless shelter run by the D.C. city government in a former hospital building. She receives a donated pack of diapers and wipes every week. But the hospital building is notoriously unsafe and literally falling apart. Armstrong and several other moms said they can hear raccoons crawling around in the ceiling at night. “You can hear them stepping,” Armstrong said on a bench outside the shelter, her baby boy eating pieces of fruit in his stroller. “It’s so disgusting.”D.C. General Hospital was originally founded two hundred years ago as the city’s poorhouse ― a now-obsolete institution thanks largely to Social Security’s monthly benefits, available to nearly everybody once they reach a certain age. Today, the poverty rate for senior citizens is less than half that for children under 18, which is nearly 20 percent. In an alternate universe with a child allowance for all American parents, experts say there would be a lot fewer poor kids. A 2016 Century Foundation report analyzed just how much child poverty could be reduced by different levels of benefits: A $2,500 annual allowance, for instance, would bring the rate down to about 11 percent. The nation’s capital might have fewer homeless families, and maybe not have turned a hospital back into a poorhouse, if local moms weren’t going broke as soon as their kids were born. Armstrong wants to study nursing, one of America’s faster-growing occupations and one that can provide a middle-class income for people with less than a bachelor’s degree. But she’s pregnant again, with the inevitable economic challenges ahead. She still needs to find reliable childcare and housing.“I want to go back to school and finish everything, and they can have their funky-ass welfare check and food stamps. It’s like, ugh, I gotta depend on the government,” she said. “I know me: I’m not the type of person to not work.”Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

The incident in Charlottesville is indicative of how far-right extremist violence has surged in the intervening years, as federal law enforcement efforts have shifted attention toward the threat posed by jihadist terrorism, former counter-terrorism officials and experts say.Conservative media and Republican politicians who oppose federal crackdowns on far-right extremist ideologues encouraged this shift, and presidents from both parties have acquiesced to the pressure. This process has only accelerated since the inauguration of President Donald Trump, who defended the white nationalist and white supremacist protesters who marched in Virginia, by saying there were some good people among them and equating them with anti-racist counter-protesters.The president and his aides support gutting efforts to counter violent extremism stemming from white supremacy and other racist ideologies in order to divert funding to anti-jihadist measures. The administration has already cut funding to the group Life After Hate, which works to rehabilitate white supremacists.“There’s been a clear signal by this administration that they don’t want to spend any money or resources on countering white terrorism,” Daryl Johnson, who led a Department of Homeland Security task force focused on domestic extremism and terrorism from 2004-2010, told HuffPost.The Trump administration’s effort to de-emphasize the threat of domestic right-wing terrorism is part of a trend: Over the past 16 years, presidents from both parties have redirected law enforcement resources away from monitoring right-wing extremists to focus on groups like ISIS and Al-Qaeda.At the same time, violent incidents, including murders, committed by far-right extremists continued to rise. Studies from the University of Maryland, New America Foundation, Southern Poverty Law Center, Combating Terrorism Center at West Point and the Department of Homeland Security highlight the continued danger of right-wing domestic terrorism.Prior to the attacks in San Bernardino and Orlando, right-wing extremist attacks had killed more Americans than extremist attacks by Muslims in the years since 9/11.“It’s a major mistake, in my view, to defund programs and efforts which help to expose and reform white supremacists,” said Todd Blodgett, a conservative Republican and former FBI source who worked undercover in white supremacist extremist groups. “It required effort to brainwash these bigots, and effort is needed to get them out of the realm of racist hatred. Having worked for Ronald Reagan and the first President Bush, including in the White House, I know they’d agree.”But the shift in resources wasn’t entirely attributable to the understandable fear of a repeat of the 9/11 attacks. Right-wing radio, Fox News, and Republican Party lawmakers fought a years-long campaign against efforts by federal law enforcement to monitor right-wing extremists and prevent them from turning violent.Blodgett points to the reaction and ultimate retraction of a 2009 Department of Homeland Security report on the increasing threat of right-wing extremist terrorism. That report was written by Johnson and his small team at DHS that monitored and countered violent extremism from domestic, non-jihadist sources. The team, constituted during the George W. Bush administration, included individuals monitoring white supremacists, anti-abortion extremists, animal rights activists, environmental terrorists and other domestic groups.Its 2009 report concluded that the economic collapse and the election of the first African-American president could fuel a surge in recruitment for white supremacist groups and lead to an uptick in violence. The report also warned that right-wing extremist groups sought to recruit returning veterans of the of the ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.But as a result of conservative outrage, DHS gutted Johnson’s team, cut the number of people investigating domestic extremism, canceled briefings for state and local law enforcement and blocked the release of more reports on domestic extremist groups. The department “has never reconstituted that effort,” Johnson told HuffPost.“There was nothing in that report that was wrong,” Blodgett said. “It was wrong of [the Obama administration] to be cowed by the groups putting pressure on them over that. As a card-carrying Republican conservative I can tell you this, this kind of stuff has got to be drummed out of any coalition that is part of any Republican campaign.”A 2012 report by Arie Perliger for the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point came to the similar conclusion that far-right terrorism was on the rise. It too was denounced by conservative media.In the ensuing years, right-wing extremist violence jumped, just as predicted by Johnson’s DHS report. According to the New America Foundation, 10 people were killed by far-right terrorist violence from 2001 through 2008. Since then, right-wing extremists have murdered 55 people in violent attacks in the U.S.Since DHS ended its program, federal law enforcement actions related to domestic right-wing extremism now primarily rest with the FBI and the Joint Terrorism Task Force, although both organizations have limited resources devoted to these efforts.Nonetheless, DHS and the FBI in May issued a joint bulletin warning about the potential threat of violence from right wing extremists, according to Foreign Policy.Michael German, a former FBI undercover agent and now a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice’s Liberty and National Security Program, felt that the 2009 report overemphasized the way in which the ideology of right-wing groups turned individuals violent rather than attracting individuals who were looking for a justification for their desire to commit acts of violence.Still, German says that the coordination between federal and local enforcement ― a recommendation of the report ― could improve, particularly in the wake of recent white supremacist and white nationalist protests in cities that have devolved into violent battles and near riots with little police supervision.It’s not just the violence the nation saw in Charlottesville, but also right-wing protests in Berkeley, Sacramento, Portland and Huntington Beach, where police took a hands-off approach. In Portland and Huntington Beach, police even allowed the right-wing protesters to “arrest” counter-protesters and drag them over to the police.“That is extremely dangerous,” German said. “To give these groups the idea that their violence is sanctioned by the state will make them far more violent and far more dangerous in the long run. Not to mention the failing to police these running street battles will encourage them to come to the next protest prepared.”The comments made by the president in defense of certain attendees of the violent white supremacist protest in Charlottesville suggest his administration will not put pressure on law enforcement groups to changes focus, especially as administration aides continue to openly dismiss the threat posed by far-right extremism.White House adviser Sebastian Gorka recently pushed aside concerns that white supremacist extremists are a problem in the U.S. “It’s this constant, ‘Oh, it’s the white man. It’s the white supremacists. That’s the problem.’ No, it isn’t,” he said on Breitbart News Daily, a radio show from the media company that used to employ him. “You have the issue of Trump kind of pandering to these groups during his election campaign and taking some of their ideas and mainstreaming them into his policies,” Johnson said. “He’s got a block out there that, I guess, that he’s beholden to.”Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

14,BLACK VOICES,Thousands Protest White Supremacy In New Orleans,David Lohr,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/protest-white-supremacy-new-orleans_us_5998d800e4b0a2608a6cb6b9,"""We want all statues dedicated to white supremacists taken down,"" an organizer said.",2017-08-20,Demonstrators protesting racism and white supremacy marched from Congo Square to Jackson Square in New Orleans on Saturday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5998d9e61400001f002c3a14.jpeg?cache=E9IprAsjyT&ops=crop_51_734_3604_2006%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW ORLEANS ― Chants of “No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA” echoed throughout the French Quarter on Saturday as thousands of people marched in a peaceful ― but loud ― protest against racism and white supremacy.Under the scorching August sun, the demonstrators marched from Congo Square to Jackson Square, starting at 1 p.m. local time. They were led by Malcolm Suber, a New Orleans activist and member of the group Take Em Down NOLA, which advocates for the removal of racist symbols and monuments.Suber told HuffPost the rally was organized for two reasons. “This is our solidarity with the people in Charlottesville, Virginia, as well as a notice to our local leaders that we want all statues dedicated to white supremacists taken down,” he said.On Aug. 12, a driver plowed into a crowd of pedestrians in Charlottesville, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer and injuring 19 other people protesting white supremacists who were rallying in the city. Watch Suber speak during Saturday’s protest in New Orleans, below.The New Orleans march was one of hundreds of rallies that took place across the country to commemorate Heyer and show opposition to white supremacists. On the same day, tens of thousands of demonstrators showed up to protest a so-called “free speech rally” in Boston, forcing the rally to end earlier than scheduled.Although dozens of law enforcement officers were on hand in New Orleans, no white supremacists showed up, and police did not make arrests this time, a New Orleans Police Department officer told HuffPost.Suber said his organization is “not satisfied” with the city’s removal of four Confederate monuments in April and May ― a response to the 2015 mass shooting of African-American churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina. If other New Orleans monuments connected to white supremacy are not soon removed, the group will see to it that they also come down, Suber said.“Just as they did in North Carolina, we will find a way to come and take them down ourselves,” Suber said, referencing the toppling of a Confederate statue in front of the old Durham County courthouse on Monday. Nearly a dozen people have been arrested in connection with that incident.In addition to removing certain monuments, Take Em Down NOLA is urging local authorities to rename schools and streets dedicated to white supremacists.City officials have yet to respond to the demands protesters made at the rally.“We are proud to carry the banner of freedom and liberation and to carry the banner of striking down these white supremacist symbols,” Suber said.David Lohr covers crime and missing persons.

15,ENTERTAINMENT,Comedian Jerry Lewis Dead At 91,Leigh Blickley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jerry-lewis-dead-dies_us_56689bc9e4b0f290e521d4af,The beloved comic enjoyed a decades-long career.,2017-08-20,Comedian Jerry Lewis attends a celebration of his 90th birthday at The Friars Club in April 2016 in New York.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5935b1de19000047003e48f8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"UPDATE (Aug. 22) ― The Clark County Nevada Coroner confirmed to TMZ that Jerry Lewis died of ischemic cardiomyopathy, an effect of coronary artery disease in which the heart can no longer pump enough blood to the rest of the body.PREVIOUSLY:Longtime actor and comedian Jerry Lewis has died early Sunday morning, his family said. “Famed comedian, actor and legendary entertainer Jerry Lewis passed away peacefully today of natural causes at 91 at his home in Las Vegas with his family by his side,” the Lewis family said in a statement to Reuters.Lewis faced many health problems throughout the years, including prostate cancer and two heart attacks. He also suffered from Type 1 diabetes and battled pulmonary fibrosis, a chronic lung disease.The beloved comic enjoyed a decades-long career, selling out his one-man shows at the 2,400-seat La Mirada Theatre for the Performing Arts in California in 2014. He achieved national fame starting in 1946 alongside Dean Martin, performing with him on television and radio shows and in movies before they parted ways in 1956 as a duo. Lewis went on to star in, produce and direct an array of films, including “The Delicate Delinquent” (1957), “The Bellboy” (1960) and “The Nutty Professor” (1963). He also made multiple television appearances and hosted the annual Labor Day Telethon for the Muscular Dystrophy Association for over 40 years until he was reportedly unceremoniously dumped by the organization in 2010 and resigned from his post as national chairman. MDA announced in May 2015 that the telethon would be ending, saying “the new realities of television viewing and philanthropic giving have made this the right time.” Despite ups and downs, Lewis continued to work, performing onstage and even directing a musical theatre version of “The Nutty Professor” at the Tennessee Performing Arts Center in Nashville in 2012. He most recently starred in the film “Max Rose,” about a jazz musician dealing with the death of his wife of 65 years, whom he discovers was unfaithful.“I’ve worked under the most painful conditions any man has ever felt in his life,” he told The Hollywood Reporter in 2014. “But when I walk out on that stage, the pain goes away.”Those touched by Lewis’ work quickly took to social media to express their regard and respect for the Hollywood legend. Actors William Shatner and Patton Oswalt expressed their condolences to Lewis’ family. Josh Gad called Lewis, “one of the greatest of all time.”Lewis, who was formerly married to Patti Palmer, is survived by his wife, SanDee Pitnick, and his children, sons Gary, Ronnie, Scott, Christopher and Anthony and daughter Danielle. His youngest son Joseph died of a drug overdose on Oct. 24, 2009, at the age of 45. "

If educators in this country ― particularly white educators, of which I am one ― weren’t already thinking about Fields’ school experience, that did it.I am certain that Weimer did everything he could to teach history well, including teaching histories of genocide in such a way that his students wouldn’t feel a sense of kinship with the perpetrators. But given Fields’ radicalization, given that he is not at all alone, and given that so many white liberals have seized on the superficially defiant but ultimately self-soothing hashtag #ThisIsNotUs, we have to conclude that white supremacy survives the education we offer. Weimar says as much: “This was something that was growing in him. I admit I failed. I tried my best.”I assume we — meaning white educators who acknowledge our country’s origins in and consistent history of racial violence — are all trying our best. And, “our best” suffers from our confusion about how to approach the enormity of the problem. We know that “white supremacy” means both the explicitly racist beliefs of someone like Fields, which we think maybe could be taught away, and the very fabric of our society. We may have a sense that “hearts and minds” work doesn’t work; we may be convinced that only systems-level solutions can begin to solve this systems-level problem, and, not being legislators, feel that all we can really do is vote and call our representatives on every lunch break.As far as those options go, we are likely right about our inefficacy, and that is demoralizing as hell. But those aren’t our only possibilities for influence.In a recent twitter thread, Gene Demby of NPR’s Code Switch put this beautifully, grounded in a different context: the dinner table. He acknowledges that we aren’t going to suddenly convince our racist uncle of the inherently equal worth of all people, but we can make it unacceptable for him to spout his bullshit. He says that this, over and over again, with everyone’s racist uncles―and more importantly, in the presence of our nieces and nephews― is what makes explicit racism socially unacceptable, which makes space for people of color to live their lives in public, and that does matter. It isn’t about hearts and minds, but norms and power.As white educators, we can do something about norms and power. Our schools and classrooms, like the nation’s dinner tables, are mini moral worlds over which we exercise major—not omnipotent, but major—influence. We construct and uphold the default discourse of these spaces. In talking with fellow educators, including white ones desperate to do better, a few practices emerged as being in urgent need of our attention and commitment.1. Refusing to hold the a**holes of history to the assumed standards of their time:When we present colonizers, enslavers, and segregationists as people who were simply misguided by the times in which they lived, we feed our current “but, both sides!” discourse problem. “That’s just what they believed” is infinitely extendible, and deeply harmful when the beliefs in question go unexamined. Can we literally teach Karl Popper’s resolution to the Paradox of Tolerance and John Rawl’s similar conclusions—roughly that an otherwise tolerant society has a duty to be intolerant of intolerance, in order to preserve itself? Possibly not. But we can teach students that anyone who argues, in any era, that those different from them should have fewer rights is straight-up wrong. We can reject the canonization of “belief” and help our students distinguish between beliefs like “all people have inherent worth and deserve protection from violence” and “some people are worth less, and may be harmed with impunity.”2. Ditching the meritocracy myth:Recent surveys indicate that white evangelical Christians are more likely than others to blame poverty on the poor themselves. It’s easy to feel disgusted by that on its face, but something similar lives in many of us raised in Protestant-ethic-infused capitalism. We love to ascribe an individual’s misfortune to their own actions, because then we can feel impervious to similar misfortune. We’ll just do it better, and that bad thing won’t happen! But the logical extension is that entire groups of people who are born into the world on ostensibly equal footing (discounting epigenetics, which we really shouldn’t) but who end up with remarkably poorer outcomes from our systems are to blame for those outcomes. Given that Black and Latinx people in particular experience just such poorer outcomes, this narrative entails that they deserve them. That conclusion, and ahistorical ideas like the “Lost Cause” myth, which the United Daughters of the Confederacy worked tirelessly to get into textbooks, are foundational to white supremacy. Except in explicitly racist speech, this all flies pretty well under conscious radar, but it’s there, it’s pernicious, and it’s keeping our country dangerous for huge segments of its population. If we tell kids that everyone in the US has an equal shot at success, and they look around at who is “successful,” they will draw the conclusions white supremacists want them to. A precursor to ditching this myth is developing our own understanding of how disparate outcomes result from policy decisions, not biology or culture (for example, disparate intergenerational wealth transfer as a result of federal housing policy), so we can start there.3. Examining our own policies:We tend to think white supremacy happens elsewhere. How critical are we about what our own schools are doing? Policies on dress codes, tardies, and lunch procedures make big differences in kids’ experience of school and how they thrive (or not). Research by Camille Farrington on academic mindsets has demonstrated the importance of a sense of belonging to student achievement; how kids feel about where they learn matters in how well they learn. Critically examining our own policies hinges on our ability to acknowledge that white supremacy isn’t something that other people do, that just happens in the South, etc, so countenancing and countering our own regionalism may be a necessary first step.4. Contextualizing test scores and “grade level” benchmarks:Our dependence on standardized tests and presumption that they somehow alone in American culture are free from racial bias is a major contributor to what many persist in calling the “achievement gap” despite its racist overtones (see also Asa Hilliard’s work, among others). In my experience, many teachers simultaneously are able to see their individual students as whole beings (not just the test scores they arrive with) AND are quick to make generalizations about “my high kids” or “my low kids” based on those scores plus the teachers’ observations of how well the students perform on the work the teacher assigns. Given that those scores are tainted by our racist systems, and that the assigned work itself may be, and that we know the impact of low expectations, this mindset can cause direct harm to our students.This list is not exhaustive, and as a white person raised in a white supremacist country, I am 100% sure I have missed multiple important boats. I hope that my colleagues will help me see where I have fallen short, now and always. People of color have said over and over again: “Get your people.” White people don’t do it, because it’s so uncomfortable. Roxane Gay recently wrote: “a white newscaster cries because talking about race makes her uncomfortable because discomfort is most likely the worst thing she can imagine.” White educators are particularly hamstrung by having been raised in white supremacy and having a job that comes with a presumption of expertise—a presumption we may internalize and adopt about ourselves, to the detriment of our ability to unlearn what we’ve been taught about history, meritocracy, and ourselves. I don’t know whether Charlottesville will improve our imagination, or spur us to finally collect our people. I do know that as a white educator I have power, and I am committed to using it toward collective liberation. May white supremacy not survive us this time.―Thank to Janine Gomez, Jean-Jacques Credi, Becky Martinez, Erin Blakemore, Caitlin McKenzie, Meg Riordan, Wanda McClure, Myra Brooks, Katie Washburn, Minna Scholten, Cheryl Dobbertin, and Ryan Maxwell."
17,POLITICS,President Trump Cedes Moral Leadership To Big Business,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-business-moral_us_599742f7e4b0e8cc855dc014,"After Charlottesville, corporations proved more responsive to public uproar than many elected officials, even if they aren't totally cutting ties with the White House.",2017-08-19,"Ken Frazier, chairman and CEO of Merck, speaks while U.S. President Donald Trump, left, listens during an announcement on a new pharmaceutical glass packaging initiative in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in July.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5997451b14000020002c3828.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A deadly attack by an avowed white supremacist shocked the nation. The president’s response came swiftly, and triggered raw emotion. Despite a sometimes strained relationship with the White House, corporate board rooms stayed silent, spared the need to weigh in. That was 2015.This week, chief executives at some of the country’s biggest companies tossed out usual protocols and disavowed the sitting commander-in-chief after President Donald Trump refused to single out the white supremacists and neo-Nazis who rallied in Charlottesville, Virginia, last weekend. Two days of protests ― featuring torch-wielding, swastika-toting, Nazi-saluting protesters opposed to removing a Confederate monument ― turned deadly when a marcher drove a car into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer. Despite calling racism “evil” at a press conference two days later, Trump said the march drew some “very fine people,” a message white supremacists interpreted as nearly-explicit approval. Big companies are by their nature risk averse when it comes to wading into political controversy. To prevent alienating customers and partners, they traditionally maintain political neutrality on issues that don’t directly intersect with their business interests, and cultivate friendly relationships with sitting administrations. But the reputational peril posed by staying silent on an issue as morally one-sided in mainstream politics as defending white supremacists proved too great this week. “It’s not worth the risk to business,” said Jonathan Bernstein, founder of the consultancy Bernstein Crisis Management. “They’re realizing very quickly that they don’t want to be associated in any way with the Trump administration and the Trump White House.” The exodus of corporate chieftains from Trump’s side began Monday, when Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier ― the only African-American on the president’s American Manufacturing Council ― quit “as a matter of personal conscience” and “to take a stand against intolerance and extremism.” Hours later, Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank and Intel CEO Brian Krzanich followed suit, even after Trump called out the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis in a damage-control speech.Trump denounced the executives as “grandstanders” and vowed to replace them, but that did nothing to stop more executives from fleeing. Public pressure began to mount as nearly half the council stepped down in protest. That left consumer-facing brands particularly at risk. No members of the president’s other business advisory panel, the Strategic and Policy Forum, had yet dropped out, but Walmart CEO Doug McMillon excoriated Trump’s response to the Charlottesville tragedy in a rare public rebuke. On Wednesday, in the face of possible boycotts, furious calls and social media messages, the remaining corporate executives agreed to disband both councils, though Trump took credit for dissolving the groups on Twitter. By the end of the week, more than half of the Commerce Department’s Digital Economy Board of Advisors had also resigned, according to a report in Politico. That group included Mitchell Baker, executive chairwoman of Mozilla.The week’s events illustrate the evolving nature of corporate power in U.S. politics. The Supreme Court’s 2010 decision known as Citizens United gave wealthy donors, including big corporations, nearly unlimited spending power in elections, in many cases reducing the influence ordinary constituents have over their elected officials. Coupled with partisan gerrymandering, which has allowed leaders to carve out districts that make political opposition almost impossible, lawmakers in Congress are increasingly unaccountable to the voters they ostensibly represent.The backlash to Trump’s Charlottesville response put that on full display. By Tuesday, Republican lawmakers began offering pointed, if mealy-mouthed, condemnations of the president’s stance. But where senators and representatives offered words, corporations ― facing similar public pressure ― took action. Of course, distance from the leader of the ruling political party won’t cost executives their jobs like it might lawmakers facing reelection in an era of hyper partisanship. At a particularly circus-like time in politics, this gives companies the ability to “become the adults in the room,” said Davia Temin, a management coach and reputation consultant who worked with some of the companies whose leaders resigned from Trump’s councils this week. “Business has a planning and strategic horizon that is further out than four years or eight years or 12 years,” she told HuffPost. “They can actually have a counterpoint and be the counterbalance to the short governance by tweet.” Trump has posed a challenge to businesses since he kicked off his presidential campaign by disparaging Mexicans as rapists and drug dealers and vowing to ban Muslims from the country. Last year, corporate giants such as Apple, Microsoft and Coca-Cola withheld funding from the 2016 Republican National Convention once it became clear Trump would clinch the nomination. Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman, a major GOP donor, reportedly compared Trump to Hitler and Mussolini during a private political summit. And BuzzFeed turned down ad money from the Republican ticket. The pressure has hardly eased up since Trump took office. Before it’s dissolution this week, the Strategic and Policy Forum saw three of its members step down earlier this year to protest separate Trump decisions they deemed indefensible.In February, Uber’s then-CEO Travis Kalanick stepped down in hopes of distancing his ride-hailing service from Trump’s executive order barring travelers from several Muslim-majority nations. In May, Tesla and SpaceX chief Elon Musk resigned after Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris climate accord left him “no choice.” Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger also resigned over the president’s decision to pull the U.S. out of the historic climate agreement, which was signed by every country except Syria and Nicaragua. Notably, even oil majors that funded campaigns to undermine climate science urged Trump to stay in the pact.Numerous tech companies denied services to the white supremacist web site The Daily Stormer last week, effectively taking it offline. “I woke up this morning in a bad mood and decided to kick them off the Internet,” Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince wrote in an email to staffers. Free speech advocates argue that private companies should not decide what content deserves to be on the internet.When Texas lawmakers tried to pass a transgender “bathroom” bill this year, businesses fearing statewide boycotts lined up against it, playing a key role in its (at least temporary) defeat. A host of major corporations opposed similar legislation in North Carolina, which was signed into law in 2016.Corporations have become much more sensitive to long-term reputational damage, Temin said. As an example, she pointed to BP in 2010. The oil giant’s chief executive ignited a firestorm when he said, “I’d like to have my life back,” as millions of gallons of crude gushed into the Gulf of Mexico during the Deepwater Horizon disaster. The comment, she said, cost the British executive his job. “If you become a pariah like BP did through so much insensitivity in the middle of a crisis ― their CEO was out,” Temin said. “He probably did a lot of the right things, but didn’t say the right things.”To be sure, business leaders standing up to Trump’s coddling of white supremacists hardly means they are cutting off communication with the White House. Despite protests during the campaign, business leaders sidled up to Trump after his surprise victory in November, particularly once he made deregulation and tax reform the bedrock of his policy agenda. The same companies who distanced themselves from Trump this week are likely to keep lobbying the White House in the months and years ahead. “Businesses will continue to engage on the issues important to the American economy, just through different venues,” Michael Steel, managing director at Hamilton Place Strategies, a public affairs firm that represents a number of financial services clients, told Politico. “Many people in the business community are frustrated by the president’s words and tweets on Charlottesville, but that does not change the importance of policies that make life better for the economy and the American people.”Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

18,POLITICS,Is Paul Ryan Helping To Support The White Supremacist Movement?,"Elliot D. Cohen, ContributorFellow, SPI, Washington, DC",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/is-paul-ryan-helping-to-support-the-white-supremacist_us_5997b6fde4b033e0fbdec443,The media should not let this question slide.,2017-08-19,"<p>Congressman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin speaking at CPAC 2011 in Washington, D.C.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5997bc6d2700001e00d4fc89.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"House Speaker Paul Ryan has yet to condemn Donald Trump’s attempt to establish a moral equivalence between hate groups such as the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), neo-Nazis, and other white supremacist groups, and those who have protested against them. Instead, he has hidden behind a veneer of ambiguity and deception, and may therefore be responsible for helping to advance the cause of such hate groups, and whatever untoward consequences follow from it.On August 15, Paul Ryan tweeted, “We must be clear. White supremacy is repulsive. This bigotry is counter to all this country stands for. There can be no moral ambiguity.” This was in response to Donald Trump’s now infamous statement of August 13, in which Trump condemned the alleged “display of hatred, bigotry and violence” which he claimed occurred “on many sides” during the Charlottesville, Virginia white supremacist protest on Saturday, August 12, in which an innocent 32-year-old woman, Heather D. Heyer, was run down by a white supremacist who drove his car into a crowd of counter-protesters.Unfortunately, Ryan’s statement was carefully crafted to look like it was unambiguously rejecting Trump’s contentious claim about a moral equivalence, when, in fact, it does not even address it. Ryan says nothing about the latter issue, while using the term “no moral ambiguity” to misleadingly suggest that he was weighing in on Trump’s controversial attempt to obscure the moral difference between white supremacists who espouse racial hatred, and those who oppose them. As such, Ryan’s claim that “there can be no moral ambiguity” is itself morally ambiguous, and apparently intentionally so.Ryan’s moral failure becomes even more remarkable in light of Trump’s subsequent doubling down on his “on many sides” claim. On August 15, during a press conference, about three hours after Paul Ryan’s ambiguous tweet, in taking questions about the Charlottesville tragedy, Donald Trump stated,I watched those much more closely than you people watched it, and you had a group on one side that was bad and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent. And nobody wants to say that, but I’ll say that right now. You had a group on one side that came charging in, without a permit, and they were very, very violent.Here, in stark terms, is Trump’s attempt to drive home a moral equivalence between white supremacists such as the KKK and the neo-Nazis, on the one side, and those who stand in opposition to them, including what Trump called the “alt-left,” presumably groups such as Black Lives Matter.Still, in the aftermath of Trump’s vociferous attempt to defend the morally indefensible, Ryan has chosen to allow his previous misleading statement to stand rather than to take an unequivocal stand against the president. This is in contrast to Vice President Pence who has been quite clear about where he stands on the matter; for he has stated that he “stands with the president.” Pence has clearly taken a calculated political risk by taking a stand. Ryan, on the other hand, has attempted to escape taking any political risks. However, as the third in line to the presidency, Ryan surely cannot ethically fail to take a clear stand on an issue that goes to the heart of who we are as Americans. The issue is not whether he condemns bigotry. What is ambiguous is whether he thinks that there are “two sides” that are equally, or almost equally, as bad — those of hate groups like the KKK and the neo-Nazis, and those who oppose them.The French existentialist philosopher, Jean-Paul Sartre, admonished that those who participate in unjust institutions are responsible for the injustices that arise out of those institutions. Trump’s rhetoric has already inspired white supremacists including former KKK leader, David Duke, who thanked Trump for his honesty and courage in telling the truth about Charlottesville and condemning “leftist terrorists in BLM/Antifa.” However, it is the white supremacists groups, not those who oppose them, which have been increasing in number in America, have been most deadly in the past, and may now, therefore, be poised to cause increasingly more bloodshed in the future. As Sartre would instruct, if Ryan remains silent, and more deaths do, in fact, occur (which is likely), then these deaths will also be his responsibility. For, he has signed on to an institution that supports such untoward consequences. Ryan cannot have it both ways. Either he “stands with the President” or he denounces the moral equivalence Trump defends. If Ryan remains silent while attempting to obscure the real issue, under the pretense that “there can be no ambiguity,” then he fails to take responsibility for his tacit acceptance of a view that supports the white supremacist movement. Sartre would say, he is living in “bad faith.” This means that he is a coward who is afraid to take responsibility, and therefore hides behind a veil of deception and sophistry. Unless Ryan is clear as to where he stands on the question of moral equivalence, there can be no moral ambiguity about at least one thing: He lives in bad faith.So where does Ryan stand? With Donald Trump, Mike Pence, and the likes of David Duke, or with those who stand unambiguously and firmly against them? The media should not let this question slide. It is a monumental question, one that itself can have profound consequences—including whether the Speaker of the House, who is constitutionally also the gatekeeper of presidential Impeachment, truly believes that the President holds values that may make him unfit as the leader of a free and democratic nation."

Robert E. Lee statue from the front of its chapel Saturday after students made very clear they don’t want the Confederate monument there anymore.Vincent Price, president of Duke University, said on the university website that he made the decision with “strong support of the Board of Trustees” after the monument was defaced on Wednesday.“I took this course of action to protect Duke Chapel, to ensure the vital safety of students and community members who worship there, and above all to express the deep and abiding values of our university,” Price said in the post Saturday.The Durham, North Carolina, university looks set to follow other institutions and relocate its monument. The memorial will be “preserved” in some capacity, Price said, “so that students can study Duke’s complex past and take part in a more inclusive future.”Last Saturday, one person was killed and several others were injured during a “Unite the Right” rally around a Robert E. Lee statue in Charlottesville, Virginia. (Not that Confederate Gen. Lee himself would have wanted the statue up in the first place.) The violent event set off a nationwide firestorm that led to the toppling of a Confederate monument outside a Durham courthouse on Monday.On Saturday, Boston prepares for its own so-called “alt-right” rally, as police brace for thousands of counterprotesters and, possibly, white supremacist figureheads who were seen in Charlottesville over the weekend. Ahead of the event, a holocaust memorial was vandalized in Boston on Monday night, the second vandalism to that monument this summer.In the two years since white supremacist and Confederate flag admirer Dylann Roof massacred nine black parishioners at a South Carolina church, the movement to remove Confederate symbols from public property has gained momentum. So far more than 60 Confederate symbols have been removed from city- and state-owned land across the U.S., according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. Recently, the city of New Orleans toppled four statues honoring the Confederacy."

Trump defends the Nazis!” The rally remained peaceful, and the number of counterprotesters dwarfed the dozens or so of those who came in support of the event, organized by members of the so-called “alt-right.”One aerial video of the demonstration appeared to show “free speech” protesters gathered under a veranda with a large crowd of counterprotesters standing across the lawns surrounding the park.On Twitter, President Donald Trump slammed the rally as having “many anti-police agitators.” Later, he praised the protesters in Boston, but did not specifically identify which group of demonstrators his message was intended for.“I want to applaud the many protesters in Boston who are speaking out against bigotry and hate,” the president tweeted. “Our country will soon come together as one!”Boston police said they made up to 33 arrests by the evening. There were reports of scuffles between police and protesters as thousands flooded the streets outside Boston Common after the rally.Organizers of the Boston Free Speech Rally, including Fitchburg State University senior film major John Medlar, stressed that the intention of the event was to “maintain that every individual is entitled to their freedom of speech and defend that basic human right.”In a Facebook post, the group added that it would not be “offering our platform to racism or bigotry” and has repeatedly disavowed any connection with the Charlottesville, Virginia, protesters.There was some confusion Saturday when Medlar didn’t immediately show up.

He said the violence in Charlottesville has “nothing to do with Boston, it was a thousand miles away.”Villareale said he didn’t know who the speakers were for the right-wing event, but he decided to show up and defend free speech.He carried a sign with him but refused to show HuffPost.“If there’s six KKK members in the entire state of Massachusetts I’d be surprised,” Villareale said. “This isn’t a Klan rally.”Odell Ruffin, a 58-year-old black Bostonian who showed up to protest, said he’s “tired of the BS.”“Here they don’t have their torches, their shields, they don’t have cans of tear gas. They say they want to make this country theirs. It was never theirs,” he said. “They don’t own this country. Slavery is over but they want it to still continue. I guess it’s one of those situations where they feel cheated that they’ve lost something they stole.”Just a couple of hours into what was supposed to be a nearly five hour rally, the alt-righters gave up and went home.After the “free speech” rally was abandoned, Boston Police Superintendent-in-Chief William Gross told counterprotesters to remain positive and celebrate their victory against hate. He also told the anti-racism demonstrators that he was proud of them.“They want to put us down because of what we look like, our lifestyles, where we came from ― it’s not happening in Boston,” Gross said in front of reporters.Despite the rally promoters’ assurance that bigotry wouldn’t be accepted Saturday, Augustus Invictus ― a known Holocaust denier and an organizer of Charlottesville’s white supremacist rally ― was invited to attend the Boston rally, but later pulled out. “We’re inviting him to speak about First Amendment issues,” Medlar told CBS Boston regarding his decision to include the conspiracy theorist. “Some people can be wrong on some issues and right on others.”The issue about which Invictus happens to be wrong is the slaughter of millions of Jews and other groups at the hands of Nazis. Invictus also spoke at the group’s last rally in May, telling those present to arm themselves for the coming civil war. The member of “Proud Boys,” a group known for brawling with antifascist protesters, told WBUR his appearance was ultimately canceled.“The right doesn’t threaten rallies to shut them down,” Invictus told WBUR. “The right never threatens violence.

Heather Heyer, a 32-year-old paralegal passionate about social justice, was killed.Heyer’s mother, Susan Bro, said at her daughter’s memorial service that white supremacists “tried to kill my child to shut her up.”“Well guess what?” Bro said. “You just magnified her.”Fears of violence at Saturday’s event spurred Boston Mayor Marty Walsh (D) to ask organizers to postpone the rally and state that hate groups aren’t wanted in Boston.Security was tight, with fences and lines of police officers separating rally-goers and counterprotesters. An FBI spokesman told CBS Boston the bureau would stand ready “should [law enforcement] request assistance or resources to address criminal activity or threats to national security.”In setting ground rules for the event, the Boston Police Department banned weapons of any kind at the gathering, including shields, open flames, firearms, knives, fireworks and flagpoles. Those bringing backpacks or large bags were subject to search, the department said in a statement released before the event. Vendors in the area were also asked to remain closed Saturday.Those “very fine people” were seen carrying torches and chanting Nazi slogans including “Blood and soil!” and “Jews will not replace us!”The white supremacist protesters in Charlottesville are now beginning to learn an important lesson: Free speech is not consequence-free.

Heather Heyer, a 32-year-old paralegal passionate about social justice, was killed.Heyer’s mother, Susan Bro, said at her daughter’s memorial service that white supremacists “tried to kill my child to shut her up.”“Well guess what?” Bro said. “You just magnified her.”Fears of violence at Saturday’s event spurred Boston Mayor Marty Walsh (D) to ask organizers to postpone the rally and state that hate groups aren’t wanted in Boston.Security was tight, with fences and lines of police officers separating rally-goers and counterprotesters. An FBI spokesman told CBS Boston the bureau would stand ready “should [law enforcement] request assistance or resources to address criminal activity or threats to national security.”In setting ground rules for the event, the Boston Police Department banned weapons of any kind at the gathering, including shields, open flames, firearms, knives, fireworks and flagpoles. Those bringing backpacks or large bags were subject to search, the department said in a statement released before the event. Vendors in the area were also asked to remain closed Saturday.Those “very fine people” were seen carrying torches and chanting Nazi slogans including “Blood and soil!” and “Jews will not replace us!”The white supremacist protesters in Charlottesville are now beginning to learn an important lesson: Free speech is not consequence-free. His OkCupid account was also banned. The dating website said there was no love lost.

Statues of men who supported the Confederacy, prominent generals like Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson, for example, have been appropriated by White supremacists (this is nothing new, actually). Such statues have been defended as “beautiful” by a man, Donald Trump, with little sense of history, even as other Americans have called for these and similar statues to be removed.Statues, of course, are just that. Inanimate objects. Places for pigeons to poop. It’s we who invest them with meaning. Most people, I think, take little notice of statues and monuments until they become controversial, after which everyone has an opinion.For me, statues and monuments are a stimulus for reflection as well as education. Who was that guy on a horse? Why is he being honored? And what does that decision tell us about who we were and are as a people?As a people, we choose certain historical figures as worthy of being sculpted in stone or cast in bronze. We choose our heroes, so to speak, our paragons, our worthies. And our choices are just that ― choices. They reflect certain values, priorities, motives, feelings. And since our values, our motives, our sense of what is good and bad, right and wrong, change over time, so too can our statues and memorials change, if that is the will of the people in a democracy that enshrines freedom of choice.If the peoples of various states choose to remove certain statues, so be it. Other statues might take their place; other worthies might be selected as more in keeping with the times and our values as we conceive them today as a people.What we choose to memorialize as a people says much about ourselves. Many statues and memorials fall under the category of “man on horseback.” Certainly, military figures like Lee and Jackson were considered great men of their times, at least in a Confederate context. They also, sadly, became potent symbols of racism in the Jim Crow South, physical symbols of the myth of the Lost Cause, intimidating and demoralizing figures to Black communities struggling against violence and prejudice.Americans are an intemperate lot, driven by extremes, constantly fighting to reconfigure ourselves through our interpretation and re-interpretation of history. All this is proof to William Faulkner’s famous saying that, “The past is not dead. It’s not even past.”As a historian, I find it deeply sad as well as ironic that, at a time when education in history is withering in the United States, the importance of history has arguably never been greater. We should use statues as a stimulus for learning, but instead they’re more often appropriated as a driver for divisiveness.If nothing else, today’s debates about statues should remind us yet again of the importance of history and a proper understanding of it. History is inherently disputatious. Controversial. Challenging. Exciting. If we can tap the heat generated by the latest controversies and warm students to a study of history in all its richness, perhaps some good can come from the ongoing controversy.What kind of statues and memorials are the “right” ones for America? It’s a vexing question, is it not? It’s also a question with powerful implications. I come back to George Orwell’s comment (slightly paraphrased): He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past.Our understanding of the past ― our selective celebration of it ― helps to define what is possible in the future. If you celebrate generals on horseback ― military men of the Confederacy ― you make a choice that helps to shape what is seen as right and proper in the present moment, and what will be right and proper in the future.For a better future, I’d like to see fewer statues to military men and sports heroes and the like, and more to visionaries who sought a better way for us as a people. I recall a small monument I saw to Elihu Burritt in Massachusetts. No one is talking about him or his legacy today. He’s an obscure figure compared to his contemporaries, Lee and Jackson. Known as the “Learned Blacksmith,” he was a committed pacifist and abolitionist who worked to educate the less fortunate in society.If we are to build prominent statues and monuments, would it not be better to build them to people like Elihu Burritt, people who worked for justice and equality, people who fought against war and slavery and for peace and freedom?Astore, a retired lieutenant colonel (USAF) and historian, blogs at Bracing Views."

Authorities have yet to identify a motive in the attack, which took place in downtown Turku. Anttoni Numminen, a 17-year-old student who lives near the scene of the attack, told HuffPost UK that he heard gunshots around 4:30 p.m. local time. “I saw the aftermath,” he said. “There was a large police presence and a helicopter. I heard gunshots. We were about to step outside but we were told we could not go out by the proprietor of my building. We were told people should stay in. People who were there were seeking refuge in businesses and shops. Obviously there was a bit of panic. People coming in and seeking refuge in our building. ... We are in shock as it is quite close to home but nothing is unexpected in the current state the world is in.”This is a developing story. Check back for updates. "

The top 10 male donors alone gave $155.4 million–much more than the $96.8 million given by the top 100 women combined. Female candidates tend to benefit most from contributions from women, and thus far in 2018, the trend shows no sign of waning.Looking at campaign contributions, an analysis of Federal Election Commission data shows that eight of the top ten politicians with the highest percentage of itemized contributions from women–that is, donations of $200 or more–are, themselves, women.Three of the women on the list–Harris, Gillibrand and Warren–have been discussed as 2020 presidential candidates. All of the top recipients are Democrats and only two are from southern states. Even the highest recipient by percentage received over 30% of her contributions from men. The list of top recipients by lowest percentage contributions from women is also distinctive and, unsurprisingly, entirely male.Eight of the ten are Republicans, and six of the ten are from Southern states. The percentages are much more lopsided with the recipients typically getting 90% or more of contributions from men. "

It’s an intensely personal matter for her. She’s a descendant of the Chitimacha Indians and a member of the small Pointe-au-Chien tribe, which experienced devastating losses when those storms smashed into coastal Louisiana.Speaking with her ex Randy, Erin invokes the long history of American oppression against indigenous peoples:“Climate change isn’t the reason I can’t have kids. It’s the reason I have to have them. If I, as a Chitimacha woman, if I decide to not have kids, well, I’m just helping the United States government finish what it couldn’t quite complete a hundred years ago.”It hit me as an audience member, through my tears and sniffles, that for Erin, having and raising Pointe-au-Chien children would be an act of defiance. As I sat with my own thoughts the next day, it hit me that this scene very much speaks to my being a dad during the Trump Administration. It tells me that raising children can be an act of resistance.Many of us who have been deeply troubled by Donald Trump’s ascent to the most humanly powerful position in the world have spoken of resistance a lot since Election Day. We’ve especially used the term when discussing how we can respond to his administration’s numerous inhumane, racially scapegoating, financially self-serving, blatantly unchristian, and just plain bizarre actions, proposals, and statements.We’ve also, naturally, created a hashtag, #resist, which has found a corollary, #persist, thanks to Mitch McConnell’s infamous quashing of Elizabeth Warren’s speech in the U.S. Senate. And some of us have even adopted the symbol of the Resistance, the good guys in the new series of Star Wars films.Of course, when it comes to resisting, the stakes are much greater for real-life Natives than they are for me. As an ethnic Han Chinese, I am one of 1.3 billion of my people. The Pointe-au-Chien, on the other hand, number in the hundreds. Resisting societal and institutional injustice is for them a matter of survival, as it is for many Native tribes.After all, the genocide of Native peoples never really ended. It is just less overt than it used to be.The long-term nature of the suffering of Native peoples and other marginalized groups points to the value of raising kids to resist and persist as activists and allies.

So through our influence on the next generation, we can help to sustain movements that insist on treating all human beings with the dignity, respect, empathy, and love that Creator says they deserve.This is a comfort to me. Like many folks engaged in social justice work, I have bouts of what I’ll call “activist’s guilt.” That’s the nagging sense that even after I’ve taken one, two, or more steps of action on a particular issue, I still haven’t done enough.Sometimes, that’s true; I haven’t done enough. But other times, I have to recognize that I can only do my part, and I’ll have to count on others to do theirs, too. Repeatedly giving in to “activist’s guilt” leads to rapid burnout for many who engage in advocacy.One example of my “activist’s guilt” centered on the women’s marches the day after Inauguration Day. Due to some family commitments, I wasn’t able to participate. I felt like I was doing something wrong by not going.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5997357514000020002c37e2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"AUSTIN, Texas ― Every time Texas State Rep. Eric Johnson (D-Dallas) walks into his office at the Capitol, he passes a plaque that says the Confederate uprising “was not a rebellion, nor was its underlying cause to sustain slavery.” The marker, titled the “Children of the Confederacy Creed,” was first hung on the legislature’s walls in 1957. It’s one of about a dozen laudatory memorials to the Confederacy scattered about the Texas state Capitol, all of which have long disturbed Johnson, one of the state’s black legislators. But after a car pummeled a crowd of anti-racist protesters at a rally called by white supremacists to preserve a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee in Charlottesville, Virginia, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer and injuring several others, Johnson requested the plaque be removed immediately.“The secession documents of the State of Texas, whose legitimacy are not in question, flatly contradict the claim in the plaque that sustaining slavery was not an underlying cause of the Civil War,” Johnson wrote in a Wednesday letter to the Texas State Preservation Board. “The plaque is at best a counterfactual propaganda proffered at the time of its installation nearly a century after the Civil War in order to discredit the growing civil rights movement in the United States.”When the legislature reconvenes, he plans to submit a resolution to remove all Confederate monuments from the Capitol.After sending the letter, he started receiving angry messages. “Tell Johnson he’s a worthless f**kin’ prick and he needs to go back to Africa if he don’t like the United States,” one voicemail said. The message didn’t shock Johnson. But he felt it confirmed his point: Confederate monuments don’t educate the public about a contentious history, as many of their supporters claim ― they glorify the losers of a war over racial slavery. “They are symbols of white supremacy and therefore they are being embraced by white supremacists. It’s pretty logical when you think about it,” Johnson told HuffPost. “And they need to go.” But his conservative Republican colleagues who dominate both the legislature and the state preservation board have yet to rally behind him.The Capitol’s Confederate monuments remained standing two years ago after white supremacist Dylann Roof shot and killed nine people at a black church in Charleston, South Carolina, prompting a national debate over such racially charged symbols. The Texas legislature ignored an attempt this year to rename “Confederate Heroes Day,” a state holiday celebrated on Jan. 19, around the time the rest of the country celebrates Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. And Gov. Greg Abbott (R), who chairs the preservation board, issued a statement Wednesday saying that removing the state’s Confederate monuments “won’t erase our nation’s past and it doesn’t advance our nation’s future.” “Racist and hate-filled violence ― in any form ― is never acceptable, and as Governor I have acted to quell it,” Abbott’s statement said. “My goal as governor is to eliminate the racist and hate-filled environment we are seeing in our country today.”The governor’s comments rang hollow to Austin City Council member Greg Casar, a Democrat. As a graduate of the University of Virginia, the weekend’s violence in Charlottesville hit him personally. “For those of us working toward racial justice, this isn’t about erasing history,” Casar told HuffPost. “This is about taking the lies out of our monuments.”Critics like Casar view Confederate monuments as symbols of a history that largely accounts for wealth disparities, police violence, poor health care and other symptoms of racial inequality that persist in Texas. One of the cornerstones of Abbott’s legislative agenda this year, Casar noted, was a state immigration crackdown that several city governments, including Austin, have challenged in the courts because they allege it would encourage racial profiling, among other reasons. “The governor has made it one of his top priorities to increase arrests of minorities and people of color,” Casar said. “What he’s saying is just a lie, just like when people say that the Civil War wasn’t about slavery, it’s a lie.”Casar is currently working on proposals to rename the Capitol city’s Robert E. Lee and Jefferson Davis roads after civil rights heroes instead of Confederate figures. (One Austin group has also proposed renaming Robert E. Lee road after Led Zeppelin frontman Robert Plant.) Several other Texas cities are reviewing whether to find a new place for Confederate monuments. But city officials have little influence over the monuments on the Capitol grounds.  Texas House Speaker Joe Straus, a moderate Republican in a state led largely by movement conservatives, offered more conciliatory remarks on Thursday, saying he’d work with Johnson to review the historical accuracy of Confederate markers on the Capitol, including the plaque 40 steps from the Dallas representative’s office. But Straus offered a similar plan to review Confederate symbols at the Capitol two years ago, with little effect. “No task force needed,” Johnson shot back Friday morning. “No interim committee needed. No study needed. Just a history book and a crowbar.” The partisan debate over whether to keep the state’s most prominent Confederate monuments mirrors the racial divide of the legislators themselves. Some 96 percent of Texas Republican state legislators are white, while 91 percent of Democratic legislators are people of color, according to a tally by the Texas Tribune. While Abbott describes himself as a crusader against racism, the state legislature dominated by his party has built a track record for passing laws that federal courts later strike down as racially discriminatory. Earlier this year, a federal judge ruled that a Texas law requiring voters to present photo ID was designed to discriminate against minorities. Last week, a panel of federal judges ruled that two congressional districts drawn by the legislature violate the Voting Rights Act by diluting the votes of Hispanic and black Texans. On the same day, Abbott issued the statement in favor of keeping the state’s Confederate monuments standing, he also announced that Texas would appeal the ruling ordering the state to redraw the discriminatory districts. Texas is home to 178 Confederate monuments, plaques and other state-sponsored symbols, according to Politico ― the second-highest number of any state in the country, behind Virginia. Perhaps the most grandiose of all of them is the Confederate Soldiers Monument, on the south lawn of the state Capitol.  Any visitor who walks up the road to the main entrance of the Texas Capitol here will first pass the towering statue honoring those who died in an effort to secede from the United States. Four bronze figures representing the divisions of the Confederate Army stand atop a granite base. Jefferson Davis, the former President of the Confederacy, is perched at the top. “The people of the South, animated by the Spirit of 1776, to preserve their rights, withdrew from the federal government in 1861,” the words carved into the monument read. “The North resorted to coercion. The South, against overwhelming numbers and resources, fought until exhaustion.” Some 437,000 Confederates “died for states’ rights guaranteed under the Constitution,” the monument says. The word “slavery” is left unmentioned. The statue was erected in 1903, the year after the state implemented a poll tax and racial qualifications for voting in primary elections that combined to slash the black vote from roughly 100,000 in the 1890s to around 5,000 in 1906. Some 41 black Texans served in the state legislature between 1868 and 1900. No black Texans were elected to the state legislature between 1900 and 1966, after the voting restrictions. Former State Sen. Rodney Ellis, a Democrat from Houston who left the legislature this year to serve as a Harris county commissioner, pushed for years to remove the monument. He didn’t succeed, but last year the state erected a statue commemorating African-American history at the Southern entrance, a few feet away.No longer a state senator, Ellis still hopes the legislature will remove statues like the Confederate Soldiers monument. “The tragic events in Charlottesville bring greater urgency to efforts in Texas and across the nation of removing these symbols of racism and hatred,” Ellis wrote in an email to HuffPost.But many Texans view the monument, like Abbott, as a benign symbol of the state’s history. Ashley Howard, 38, passed by the statue on Thursday on a bike ride with a friend. “It’s been here, so why would we change it?” Howard told HuffPost. “It’s part of our culture.” Another visitor, Edward Newland, felt more ambivalent. “I see both sides of it,” the 20-year-old Texas A&M University student told HuffPost. “But I think you can have the monuments to educate people. It’s a reminder of what was bad in the past.” Asked if he thought about the criticism that the monument whitewashes the role of slavery in the Civil War, Newland pointed toward the African-American history monument that Ellis had pressured to build. A group of three black women stood there, discussing the memorial. All of them viewed the violence in Charlottesville as a symptom that white supremacists and neo-Nazis felt increasingly confident expressing their views publicly because of the country’s reactionary politics.Renee Mills said her 18-year-old son showed interest in applying to Texas A&M University. But she feared for his safety after white supremacists scheduled a rally there on Sept. 11, featuring white nationalist speaker Richard Spencer. Texas A&M hosted Spencer for a talk about white supremacy last year, but the university canceled the event scheduled for Sept. 11, citing safety concerns. Organizers are considering whether to challenge the decision in the courts and may still hold a rally there off campus at some point in the future.“I don’t want him exposed to what my grandparents said they were exposed to,” Mills said of her son. Lori Nicholas, 55, said she grew up in New Orleans, where she rarely gave much thought to the prominent monument to Confederate General Robert E. Lee, which the city removed earlier this year. “But with all this Trump stuff it makes you think, ‘why are we glorifying people who fought to keep us enslaved?’ They’re not heroes,” Nichols said. “That’s the good thing about the Trump presidency ― we are talking about this now. Unless you have a country-wide conversation, nothing is going to change.” "

In Ohio, officials send voters who haven’t voted in two years a confirmation notice. If they don’t respond, they’re purged from the rolls if they fail to vote for an additional four years. Under the Obama administration, the Department of Justice supported plaintiffs who claimed that Ohio’s process violated a 1993 federal law against purging voters because they don’t vote. But Justice Department lawyers recently filed a brief reversing that position and saying the process in Ohio is legal. Such a reversal, especially because DOJ had supported the plaintiffs in lower courts, is unusual.A majority of the Commission on Civil Rights members voted Friday to express “serious concern” with the Justice Department’s new position. The bipartisan commission, created in 1957, is charged with investigating and making recommendations on civil rights issues.“This stance opens the door to more aggressive and inaccurate purging of voter rolls, which can lead to widespread voter disenfranchisement and suppression of low income communities and communities of color,” the commission said in a statement.The Justice Department’s reversal in the Ohio case marked the second time the Trump administration has reversed course on a major voting rights case. The Trump administration also abandoned support for a challenge of Texas’ voter ID law.Catherine Lhamon, chair of the commission, said that it would continue to monitor the way the Department of Justice enforces civil rights laws.“The right to vote is fundamental in our American democracy. The Commission will continue to uphold its 60-year mandate to protect that right and remains vigilant in ensuring the Department of Justice fulfills its own mandate of enforcing federal civil rights statutes,” she said in a statement."

This is dedicated to the memory of Heather Heyer and to bringing truth to the false perceptions and calculated lies that divide us. David Livingstone Smith is a Professor of Philosophy at the University of New England in Biddeford, Maine. He earned his Ph.D. from the University of London, Kings College, where he worked on Freud’s philosophy of mind and psychology. His current research is focused on dehumanization, race, propaganda, and related topics. David is the author of seven books and numerous academic papers. His most recent book Less Than Human: Why We Demean, Enslave and Exterminate Others (St. Martin’s Press, 2011) was awarded the 2012 Anisfield-Wolf award for nonfiction. He is also editor of How Biology Shapes Philosophy, which will be published by Cambridge University Press later this year, and he is working on a book entitled Making Monsters: The Uncanny Power of Dehumanization, which will be published by Harvard University Press.David speaks widely in both academic and nonacademic settings, and his work has been featured extensively in national and international media. In 2012 he spoke at the G20 summit on dehumanization and mass violence. David strongly believes that the practice of philosophy has an important role to play helping us meet the challenges confronting humanity in the 21st century and beyond, and that philosophers should work towards making the world a better place. Robert: David, your great book, Less Than Human, has stayed with me since I first read it a few years ago. What, if any, connections should I make between race, racism and dehumanization?David: Racism and dehumanization are very intimately connected. To explain the connection, I need to say a little bit about what race and dehumanization are.Let’s start with race. Races are supposed to be real, objective divisions of the human family—analogous, perhaps, to breeds of dog. To be a member of a certain race is to be a certain kind of human being. Racial identity is supposed to be innate and unalterable (you don’t have any choice about what race you belong to) and transmitted from one generation to the next.There are many systems of racial classification and these vary from one historical era to the next as well as from culture to culture. Contemporary Americans regard Irish and Jewish people as white, but this wasn’t always the case. In the past, both Irish and Jewish people were thought of as belonging to non-white races. When English settlers first landed on the shores of North America, they considered Native Americans as white, and only later came to regard them as members of an alien race (the “merciless Indian Savages” of the Declaration of Independence). And, in Sudan, the dark-skinned residents of the northern part of the country regard those living in the south, but not themselves, as “black.” But Americans would see them both as members of the same race. Most people think that it’s obvious that races are real biological categories. However, most of the scholars who study race think that races are invented categories. When one group of people sets out to oppress another, they “racialize” them—that is, they think of them as fundamentally different from and, importantly, inferior to themselves. Prior to the trans-Atlantic slave trade, sub-Saharan Africans did not consider themselves members of a single, homogeneous “black” race. Instead, they identified themselves as members of any one of a number of distinct groups—as Akan, Wolof, Mbundu, etc. The idea of “blackness” was a European invention, designed to legitimize the oppression of Africans. The idea that races are invented will probably sound crazy to a lot of people. They’ll think of it as a silly idea that only an academic who’s out of touch with the real world could come up with. Surely, there are visible features such as skin color, hair texture, facial morphology, and body build that set the races apart from one another! It would be foolish to pretend that there aren’t obvious biological differences between human beings and that these differences are tied to certain geographical regions. If you’re a light-skinned person with blue eyes you very probably had lots of ancestors from northern Europe, and if you’re a dark-skinned person with tightly curled dark hair you very probably had lots of ancestors from sub-Saharan Africa. Nobody worth listening to denies these facts about human diversity, but there’s a big difference between race and diversity.Phenotypic diversity is a fact, but race is a theory. It’s what we call a folk-theory. It’s a way of trying to explain human diversity by positing that there are a small number of “pure” types (races) of human beings—black, white, etc. According to the folk-theory, everyone is either a member of one of these pure types or a mixture of them. This theory of race is false, for all sorts of reasons. One reason is the fact that the biological traits that are conventionally associated with race—like skin color—vary continuously across geographical regions. Imagine taking a slow train from equatorial Africa to Scandinavia. As you travel north, the skin color of the people that you see lightens gradually. So any line that you choose to draw between so-called white people and so-called black people is bound to be arbitrary. The very same consideration applies to all the other “racialized” traits as well.Now, there’s one more key point about race that I need to discuss before moving on to talk about dehumanization. According to the folk-theory, a person’s appearance is an indicator of their race, but it isn’t what makes them a member of that race. Perhaps an analogy will make this a little clearer. Sneezing, a stuffy nose, and a sore throat are all symptoms of having a cold, but they aren’t what make it the case that one has a cold (being infected with a cold virus). If a person’s race were purely a matter of how they look, it would be possible to change one’s race by changing one’s appearance. But (as evidenced by the public outcry surrounding Rachel Dolezal last year) this doesn’t fit with the way that we ordinarily think about race. Also, consider the notion of “passing.” A person is said to “pass” as a member of a race if they misleadingly present themselves as belonging to that race on the basis of their appearance (for obvious reasons, it is most often members of oppressed groups that pass themselves off as members of the dominant group, although there are some interesting exceptions). If race were really determined by appearance, then the notion of passing would make no sense at all.The fact that the way that a person is racially categorized can come apart from their appearance forces us to look more deeply into what’s really going on when we racially classify people. We seem to assume that every member of a race shares some deep characteristic or “essence” that is unique to that race—something “in the blood” or in the genes that’s innate, unchangeable, and inherited biologically from one’s parents. The notion that there are racial essences doesn’t have a shred of scientific support. In fact, it’s totally incompatible with what science tells us about human variability. It’s pure fiction, but it’s a fiction that’s stubbornly rooted in our ordinary ways of thinking.Now we’re positioned to move on to the topic of dehumanization. I need to start by clarifying what I mean by “dehumanization.” The word “dehumanization” is used in all sorts of ways in both the scholarly and popular literatures. Some people see any kind of demeaning, disrespectful, or degrading treatment of others as dehumanizing. Others think of objectification—for example, the sexual objectification of women in pornography—as dehumanizing. And there are many, many more notions of dehumanization in circulation. When I use the term “dehumanization,” I have something very specific in mind: when we dehumanize others, we think of them as subhuman creatures.A lot of my work on dehumanization has been focused on explaining why this happens and explicating the psychological processes that underpin it. Briefly, I think that we dehumanize others to disable inhibitions against harming them. All social animals have built-in inhibitions against harming members of their communities. If these inhibitions weren’t in place, their social groups would disintegrate. Human beings are far more social than any other mammal. We live in very large, highly cooperative groups in which lethal violence is relatively uncommon. However, we’re also highly intelligent primates, and our great big brains enable us to recognize that it’s sometimes advantageous for us to do violence to our fellow human beings. Dehumanization is a way of overcoming our inhibitions against performing acts of violence for our own advantage. Conceiving of other people as rats, snakes, lice, dangerous predators, or beasts of burden, makes it much easier to treat them inhumanely. Racism is often a precursor to dehumanization. In circumstances where one group of people wants to exterminate, harm, or enslave another group of people, the first step is to form the belief that the target group is racially alien. But this isn’t yet dehumanization, because members of the target group are seen as inferior human beings, but human beings nonetheless. However, racism very easily transforms into dehumanization. When this happens, members of the oppressed group are no longer seen as inferior human beings, but rather as counterfeit human beings—beings that look like humans, but which aren’t really human at all. I have written extensively about the transition from racialization to dehumanization: Native Americans, Africans, Jews and other racialized groups have all, at one time or another, been regarded as subhuman entities.Robert: So, couldn’t our great big brains be responsible for either innate or evolved processes that prompt us to quickly distinguish and categorize one face from another perhaps to determine friend from foe? Was the concept of race born as some kind of survival mechanism? David: Because we’re hypersocial primates, with a strong bias towards vision, we have a knack for recognizing and categorizing human faces. In fact, there is some very cool research from neuroscience showing that the human brain processes faces very differently than it processes other kinds of visual inputs. And yes, the ability to distinguish between friend and foe is one aspect of our social intelligence—but it’s not the only aspect, and perhaps not the most significant one. However, distinguishing friend from foe is a far cry from sorting people into races. During our evolution, human beings lived in small, relatively isolated groups and rarely if ever encountered people who were “racially” different. It follows from this that prehistoric people’s friends and foes were overwhelmingly likely to be members of the same “racial” group. More importantly, remember my point that racial categorization isn’t simply the perception of biological diversity. It’s a way of explaining diversity by categorizing people into types, and the evidence is simply overwhelming that the way that we carve up the human family into races is best explained by political forces rather than any innate tendency to distinguish friend from foe. Having said all of this, I want to make it clear that I don’t want to deny that the evolved structure of the human mind is irrelevant to racial thinking. Human beings are animals, and that means that evolution plays some role in explaining everything about us. The question is, what role does it play in any given case? I think that the evidence points to the conclusion that the relation between our cognitive evolution and our tendency to racialize others is an indirect one. Robert: What is the difference between race and ethnicity?David: Well, the difference is supposed to be that race pertains to biology while ethnicity pertains to culture. One way of cashing this out is to say that you can change your ethnicity but you can’t change your race. But, in practice, the situation is a lot messier than these definitions suggest. The category “Hispanic” is supposed to refer to an ethnicity, but people classified as “Hispanic” belong to a diverse range of cultures. “African American” is thought of as a racial category, but it’s actually a cultural one (Ethiopians have very little in common with African Americans, but they’re considered members of the same race). Furthermore, ethnic categories readily become racialized, and vice versa. Although “Hispanic” is ostensibly an ethnic category, in practice it’s increasingly being treated as a racial one. Jews used to be thought of as a non-white race, but nowadays Jewishness is at least ostensibly thought of as an ethnicity. Because the boundary between race and ethnicity is so permeable, many scholars have abandoned “race” and “ethnicity” in favor of the hybrid term “ethnorace.” Robert: Are there any positive applications for the concept of race in our society? What are the negative consequences of race consciousness? David: Karl Marx once wrote, “The tradition of all the dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brains of the living.” That perfectly sums up my view of race. I think that race is a destructive and oppressive delusion—a nightmare. The idea of race has facilitated war, genocide, chattel slavery, and oppression for thousands of years. Think of the trans-Atlantic and trans-Saharan slave trades, the holocaust, the Namibian and Rwandan genocides, the extermination of Native Americans, Belgian colonialism in the Congo (which took the lives of as many as ten million women, men, and children), the genocide unfolding in Sudan as you read these words, and the atrocities perpetrated against African Americans in the South for a century after slavery was ostensibly abolished in the United States. Think of the racism still rampant in the world today—and the poverty, mass incarceration, and exclusion that comes in its wake. All of these, and many more, are legacies of racial thinking. The idea of race would have to have a great deal going for it to counterbalance the evil that has been, and continues to be, committed in its name. Some people argue that we need to retain the idea of race to justify affirmative action and reparations (both of which I strongly support). But acknowledging that African Americans and other racialized groups have been treated unjustly doesn’t require us to retain the idea that there are races any more than, say, acknowledging the fact that many thousands of women were once executed for being witches requires us to retain the idea of witchcraft. Another argument for the positive value of race is that it provides a focus for solidarity among oppressed and marginalized people. This is true, but notice that the need for such solidarity is itself a result of racialized oppression. The idea of race created the problem for which it is offered as a solution! Robert: How could the perception of race be successfully replaced? David: I think that the project of getting over race needs to be pursued on at least three fronts. One is psychological. It’s clear that there’s something about how the human mind works that makes us vulnerable to the race delusion. This suggests that our strategies should take account of a sound understanding of the psychological forces that drive racial thinking. One view of the psychology of race, which I think has a whole lot going for it, is that our minds have a built-in tendency to essentialize, and that this explains why the idea of race comes so easily to us and why it’s so difficult to uproot. If this is right, then we should identify the circumstances that promote or discourage essentialistic thinking, and craft interventions accordingly. For example, there’s psychological research suggesting that certain forms of speech (technically called “generics”) encourage us to essentialize others. Perhaps avoiding those linguistic forms might help us get over race. The second front is social and political. The idea of race is sedimented in our cultural practices and institutions, and is affirmed and reaffirmed every day in the media, on application forms that ask us to check off our race, and so on. We’re all marinated in racial ideology, and an effective campaign against racialization needs to address the issue at the collective, structural level as well as the individual, psychological one. Finally, I think that we need to address the problem educationally. Most people are ignorant of the hideous history of race and racism, and don’t understand that folk-biological concepts of race are scientifically incorrect. A little education can provide a big bang for the buck. Once a year, I teach a course entitled “Race, racism, and beyond” to upper-level undergraduates. Many of these (predominantly white) students come to the course with very naïve conceptions about race and racism, and learning the facts is a revelation to them. Some of them parrot that race is a “social construction” without any real understanding of what this means. By the end of the course, these students very often report that they feel cheated by the educational system for not addressing such an import subject, and many of them passionately express the view that this course should be a mandatory component of every college student’s education. Almost without exception, they say that their views about race have been radically transformed. I find this immensely heartening. It may be that the psychological and social forces are so formidable that we’ll never be able to cure ourselves of the race delusion. But we don’t know, because we’ve never tried.Robert: David, your ideas are a good start to addressing the race delusion. Thank you."

Police blocked off the courthouse in advance of the protests, which Durham officials said they expected around noon on Friday. Several county offices closed early in advance of the rally, as did some retailers, according to INDY Week.Durham County Sheriff Mike Andrews issued a statement thanking the community “for a peaceful demonstration,” and adding:Throughout the day, we have received numerous reports of potential counter protests in the Durham community. The Sheriff’s Office has been gathering and reviewing information related to potential counter protests throughout the week. We have taken steps to ensure public safety. At this time, law enforcement continues to monitor the area and has not confirmed reports of activity. We are urging residents to avoid joining the crowd in the downtown area as law enforcement continues to monitor the situation. Residents are encouraged to rely on verified information.The city of Durham noted it issued no event permits for any group on Friday, seeking to temper the rumors of what some believed could be a large rally.LA Chesson brought an easel and canvas to the rally, which he proceeded to set up by the courthouse and paint a large heart.“Everybody has their purpose,” he told HuffPost. “Some want to hate, some want to spread love. I’m a painter, so I paint.” While the rumored crowd of white supremacists did not appear at the noon rally, a few individuals did draw the ire of the counterprotesters early on.In one such confrontation, the crowd yelled “F**k you cowards” at two men, though it’s not clear what prompted the clash.At one point, counterprotesters gathered to burn a Confederate flag outside the courthouse, where earlier this week protesters pulled down a Confederate statue in response to violence in Charlottesville:Dave DeWitt, a reporter for North Carolina Public Radio, described the scene as volatile and primed for conflict should the KKK or other white supremacist groups arrive.As the counterprotest wore on, part of the crowd held a dance-off, while chants of “Durham resists hate” rang out. Many cheered for those arrested for tearing down a Confederate statue in the city earlier this week.Manju Rajendran, a Durham resident with the Anti Oppression Resource and Training Alliance, wrapped up the event with a crowd chant: “We dedicate this space today to the ones to come. We promise to fight for a Durham free from hate. We will end white supremacy.

Police blocked off the courthouse in advance of the protests, which Durham officials said they expected around noon on Friday. Several county offices closed early in advance of the rally, as did some retailers, according to INDY Week.Durham County Sheriff Mike Andrews issued a statement thanking the community “for a peaceful demonstration,” and adding:Throughout the day, we have received numerous reports of potential counter protests in the Durham community. The Sheriff’s Office has been gathering and reviewing information related to potential counter protests throughout the week. We have taken steps to ensure public safety. At this time, law enforcement continues to monitor the area and has not confirmed reports of activity. We are urging residents to avoid joining the crowd in the downtown area as law enforcement continues to monitor the situation. Residents are encouraged to rely on verified information.The city of Durham noted it issued no event permits for any group on Friday, seeking to temper the rumors of what some believed could be a large rally.LA Chesson brought an easel and canvas to the rally, which he proceeded to set up by the courthouse and paint a large heart.“Everybody has their purpose,” he told HuffPost. “Some want to hate, some want to spread love. I’m a painter, so I paint.” While the rumored crowd of white supremacists did not appear at the noon rally, a few individuals did draw the ire of the counterprotesters early on.In one such confrontation, the crowd yelled “F**k you cowards” at two men, though it’s not clear what prompted the clash.At one point, counterprotesters gathered to burn a Confederate flag outside the courthouse, where earlier this week protesters pulled down a Confederate statue in response to violence in Charlottesville:Dave DeWitt, a reporter for North Carolina Public Radio, described the scene as volatile and primed for conflict should the KKK or other white supremacist groups arrive.As the counterprotest wore on, part of the crowd held a dance-off, while chants of “Durham resists hate” rang out. Many cheered for those arrested for tearing down a Confederate statue in the city earlier this week.Manju Rajendran, a Durham resident with the Anti Oppression Resource and Training Alliance, wrapped up the event with a crowd chant: “We dedicate this space today to the ones to come. We promise to fight for a Durham free from hate. We will end white supremacy. We will put our bodies on the line.”The group planned to meet up at a local food co-op to discuss their next steps.The Durham County Sheriff’s Office is also encouraging residents to be skeptical of additional protests rumored for later today:"
33,POLITICS,Major Nonprofits Cancel Mar-a-Lago Fundraisers After Charlottesville,Ryan Grenoble,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nonprofits-mar-a-lago-trump_us_599735e9e4b0a2608a6c44de,"""Mar-a-Lago ... has increasingly become a source of controversy and pain for many of our volunteers, employees and supporters,"" said the American Red Cross.",2017-08-18,"View of a pool and spa at Mar-a-Lago on Feb. 13, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59974fdc2700003100d4fc20.jpeg?cache=vfnkHJnwM9&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A sizable ― and growing ― number of nonprofits are walking away from hosting fundraisers at Mar-a-Lago, President Donald Trump’s posh resort in Palm Beach, Florida.On Thursday, the Cleveland Clinic and American Cancer Society both announced they were pulling the plug on their galas there. By Friday, seven groups had canceled events.Other organizations backing out include the Autism Project of Palm Beach County, the Salvation Army, Susan G. Komen, the American Red Cross, and American Friends of Magen David Adom, an Israeli EMS and blood bank provider, according to a tally by The Washington Post’s David Fahrenthold.The mass exodus follows a week in which Trump repeatedly declined to condemn white supremacists who descended on Charlottesville, Virginia, and provoked deadly violence there.“You have people who are very fine people on both sides,” Trump said on Tuesday, equating counterprotesters to marchers who carried torches, Confederate and Nazi flags and shouted racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic epithets.“The American Red Cross has decided we cannot host our annual fundraising event at Mar-a-Lago, as it has increasingly become a source of controversy and pain for many of our volunteers, employees and supporters,” the organization explained in a statement on Friday.“The Red Cross provides assistance without discrimination to all people in need, regardless of nationality, race, religious beliefs, sexual orientation, or political opinions, and we must be clear and unequivocal in our defense of that principle,” it concluded.The Salvation Army, which hosted a “Holiday Snow Ball” at Mar-a-Lago, said it’s leaving because the venue distracts from the nonprofit’s mission of “helping those in need.”“Because the conversation has shifted away from the purpose of this event, we will not host it at Mar-a-Lago,” the organization explained in a statement.Numerous business leaders, politicians and artists have already scrambled to disassociate themselves from Trump, and the list of groups bailing on Mar-a-Lago will likely grow.Leaders In Furthering Education, for instance, is still tentatively holding its Dec. 2 gala at the resort. But on Friday, the group’s president, Lois Pope, penned a blistering statement urging the board to find a new venue.“Indeed, the hatred, vitriol and Anti-Semitic and racist views being spewed by Neo-Nazis and White Supremacists are repugnant and repulsive ― and they are antithetical to everything that this country, and I personally stand for,” Pope wrote.“Anyone who would demonstrate even a modicum of support for them by insisting that there are ‘good people’ among them is not deserving of my personal patronage or that of my foundations,” she added."
34,MEDIA,James Murdoch Rips Donald Trump's Response To Charlottesville,Alana Horowitz Satlin,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/james-murdoch-trump-charlottesville_us_5996a61ae4b0a2608a6b7fbb,"“I can’t even believe I have to write this: standing up to Nazis is essential.""",2017-08-18,"James Murdoch, the CEO of 21st Century Fox, says vigilance against hate and bigotry is ""an eternal obligation.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5996b2782200002d001a69c9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"James Murdoch, the younger son of Fox News co-founder and acting CEO Rupert Murdoch, came out swinging against President Donald Trump’s response to the recent violence at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.The younger Murdoch is the CEO of 21st Century Fox, the parent company of Fox News. His father is a supporter and friend of Trump, who earlier this week was overwhelmingly criticized for equating white supremacists in Charlottesville to the activists protesting them. In an email obtained by the Hollywood Reporter, James Murdoch told friends that Trump’s reaction was concerning. “These events remind us all why vigilance against hate and bigotry is an eternal obligation ― a necessary discipline for the preservation of our way of life and our ideals,” he wrote. “The presence of hate in our society was appallingly laid bare as we watched swastikas brandished on the streets of Charlottesville and acts of brutal terrorism and violence perpetrated by a racist mob.”And in a line that seemed to take on Trump’s claim that there were some “very fine people” among the white supremacists, many of whom carried swastikas and shouted anti-Semitic chants, Murdoch wrote:“I can’t even believe I have to write this: standing up to Nazis is essential; there are no good Nazis. Or Klansmen, or terrorists. Democrats, Republicans, and others must all agree on this, and it compromises nothing for them to do so.”Murdoch also said he was pledging $1 million to the Anti-Defamation League, an organization that fights anti-Semitism and which has repeatedly condemned Trump’s treatment of white supremacist groups. He urged friends to do the same.21st Century Fox confirmed the authenticity of the email to The New York Times.Murdoch’s response represents not only a break from his father, but of the news network that he oversees. Many of Fox News’ hosts have emerged as close allies of the president. A Harvard Study of Trump’s first 100 days in office found that the network covered the president more positively than any other major media outlet. Trump has in turn spared Fox News, which he reportedly watches daily, from the criticism he’s given most other major media outlets."

In Charlottesville, we saw hate in its purest and most repulsive form. We saw white supremacists carrying torches and screaming. We saw Nazis and members of the KKK vowing to “...fulfill the promises of Donald Trump.” We saw dangerous men carrying assault rifles ― a despicable intimidation tactic. We saw violence and, tragically, we saw death.We waited for Donald Trump to condemn the hatred and violence that transpired in his name. But we came up empty. When we looked to Trump for a repudiation of hatred, he gave us hatred in return. His remarks on Saturday and Tuesday were disgusting. His embrace of white nationalism and violence was bone-chilling.But, unfortunately, we should not be surprised.Since he began his presidential campaign, Trump has embraced the National Rifle Association’s toxic philosophy of insurrectionism ― citizens’ use of private guns to influence public policy.Recent videos and statements by Wayne LaPierre and Dana Loesch have encouraged NRA members to fight back against the so-called “violent left” ― a concept Trump has amplified. Trump and the NRA have given hate groups a green light for action; so it should come as no surprise that hundreds of their supporters showed up in Charlottesville outfitted for war.The NRA has always encouraged taking up arms against their dissenters. During the Obama years, they advocated violence against the government. Now their primary ally is the federal government. Their new solution is taking up arms against citizens ― “the resistance” ― those who don’t think like them, pray like them, or look like them. The solution has always been violence; the only thing that has changed is their target.What makes these threats particularly scary is that the NRA’s insurrectionist philosophy has been coupled with successful legislative efforts that allow nearly every racist domestic terrorist to obtain deadly assault weapons.The consequences of this toxic intersection became evident in Charlottesville.As is the case with most national tragedies, the NRA has chosen not to respond to what happened. Their silence is nearly as revealing as Trump’s defense of domestic terrorism. The NRA prides themselves on being Trump’s greatest ally. Charlottesville is no exception.As of this week, Trump has officially, publicly, overtly aligned himself with white supremacists and insurrectionists. And through their silence and willingness to arm bigots, the NRA stands with him. The NRA is a champion of insurrectionism, and by association, of white supremacy. A champion of violence. A champion of Nazis and Klansman led by their commander-in-chief. And the official provider of their weapons of war. Weapons that intimidate. Weapons that send a message. Weapons that kill. Weapons that threaten our democracy.The domestic threat that our nation saw on Saturday has been simmering for decades. Racist fringe groups and militias have been organizing underground. They have been emboldened by the rhetoric of the NRA. Now, Trump has further legitimized these un-American traitors. As a result of the NRA’s philosophy and the hatred Trump promotes, there will be more violence. There will be more deaths.The NRA claims to be a defender of freedom. They claim to revere the Constitution. Donald Trump took an oath to defend the nation from all enemies, foreign and domestic. He vowed to uphold the Constitution, the rule of law, and the democratic institutions that our founders enshrined in that document. This week, he broke that oath.And the NRA said nothing."

But when the singer, actress and comedian landed a plum role in “Patti Cake$,” the Sundance Film Festival smash that hits theaters today, her nerves almost got the better of her.“I honestly didn’t know if I was going to be able to do it,” Everett, 45, told HuffPost. “I was just so scared of failing. Fortunately [writer-director] Geremy Jasper is very persuasive. So, I figured, what did I have to lose?”Though Everett had memorable “Sex and the City” and “Trainwreck” cameos, “Patti Cake$” marks her first principal role on the big screen. The Kansas native stars as Barb, the alcohol-downing, down-on-her-luck single mom of an aspiring female rapper, Patricia Dumbrowski (Danielle Macdonald), in suburban New Jersey. The film, which also stars Cathy Moriarty and Siddharth Dhananjay, nods to “8 Mile” and “Precious,” but its rags-to-artistic-riches narrative feels topical and fresh in its defiance of racial and gender stereotypes.Everett, in particular, shines in two musical numbers, but displays a poignant vulnerability in the film’s heavier scenes. Relating to Barb came naturally – “I waited tables for 25 years, so I had a lot of sad nights on the couch, drinking Chardonnay and trying to comfort myself,” she quipped – and to say she’s first-rate in the film is an understatement.“It was really cool to try to show people other sides of me, and to push myself to really connect,” she recalled. “I like to talk to people when I’m onstage, but being in a scene with someone one-on-one is beyond any level of intimacy that I’ve had in the past few years. There are a lot of layers to me, as there are for anyone else, so it was very exciting.”Thus far, critics have welcomed Everett’s transition to tragicomedy. The New York Times praised the star for “endowing [Barb] with dignity even at her worst,” while Time Out New York described her performance as “heartbreaking.”Everett’s “Patti Cake$” performance couldn’t be more different than her acclaimed live act, which has been compared to Bette Midler in her gay bathhouse days. Not everyone can pair Broadway-style vocals with raunchy sex talk, ample cleavage and “motorboating,” but Everett makes it seem oddly natural. (Patti LuPone is a devoted fan and has made a guest appearance or two.) Though Everett is grateful for the acclaim “Patti Cake$” has received, it’s clear she won’t be seeking Hollywood acceptance anytime soon. “I don’t really give a shit about that – you can’t when you’re a plus-sized woman who ‘motorboats’ people for a living,” she said. “You can’t care what people think, and if you do, you’re going to stop being interesting. I’m not for everybody, and that’s totally fine by me.” The Aug. 18 release of “Patti Cake$” marks the start of a new creative chapter for Everett. This month, she can also be seen alongside Toni Colette and Molly Shannon in the comedy “Fun Mom Dinner,” which also premiered at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival. She also shot the pilot for “Love You More,” a new Amazon series co-starring Loni Anderson and produced by “Sex and the City” veteran Michael Patrick King that’s slated to debut in September. Though it’s too soon to tell for sure, Everett’s career trajectory appears similar to that of another breakout star, Amy Schumer. The women are longtime friends, and have collaborated on a handful of “Inside Amy Schumer” episodes. Schumer’s influence on Everett, however, has been even more significant offstage.“She’s really inspiring to me, because I can be selfish. I can isolate and be a loner, and she’s helped to change that in me,” she said. “You can be in a room full of comics and yet everyone’s always laughing at Amy. She’s so sharp, so funny, so willing to do anything to make people happy.”High-profile movie roles and friendships aside, Everett has no intention of losing touch with her roots. She’s shared many stages with queer performers Cole Escola and Erin Markey, and continues to cite them (as well as other LGBTQ artists) as creative influences. “People use the word ‘fearless’ a lot, but there’s a genuine fearlessness that courses through the veins of New York’s queer art world that I think is just electric,” she said. “Their unpredictability is what keeps me on my toes.”Regardless of future opportunities that come her way, Everett will always be drawn back to the stage. “It’s where I feel the most alive, the most fulfilled, the most excited,” she explained. “New York audiences have given me a lot of great gifts, and I want to keep that relationship going.” After a quick pause, she added “Plus, it’s the only time anyone ever touches my body. I can’t let that go.”Catch the latest in LGBTQ culture by subscribing to the Queer Voices newsletter. "

That’s certainly the case for Keshia Gardner. The Alabama mom shared some hilarious photos her family took in honor of back-to-school season. Gardner has been taking these “jump for joy” photos since 2013. “We are a pretty comical family, so we gave up on traditional family pictures a long time ago,” she told HuffPost.“And I wanted to cheer up my friends that were sad because their babies started kindergarten. I remember how hard that day was for me,” she added.The photos were taken at the family’s farm, where they are currently building their new home. Although her husband, Andrew, usually takes the photos, Gardner decided to bring him in front of the camera this year ― a change that took some persuasion. “The first thing that he said was ‘I will do it with you, but I’m not jumping!’ So, the only other logical thing for him to do was to soak in the water trough ― which was his idea,” Gardner explained. For Gardner, the back-to-school season can be hectic. “We are a blended family consisting of biological, step- and foster children. We have fostered over 40 children within the last 10 years,” she explained. The mom said her kids love taking the annual photo and seeing how much joy and laughter it brings people on social media. “I think they really enjoy laughing at me trying to jump over and over,” Gardner said. Though the photo is staged, the mom said she really does feel such joy and relief when the school year starts. “It’s not because I don’t love my kids, but for me, it’s because we function better in a routine,” she explained. “Summer is hard when you work full time. Parenting is hard.”With that in mind, Gardner believes parents have a lot to celebrate when the first day of school rolls around. “The dreaded school shopping is over, juggling babysitters is over, refereeing arguments over the remote control or whose turn it is to watch their show is over,” she said. “Receiving ‘I’m bored’ texts a million times a day, while you are at work, over. Trying to make enough money to keep up with their summer food demands, over.”Although Gardner said she faced some mom-shaming for her photos, she just brushed it aside. “I mean, they haven’t taken my teenager shopping, so ...” she joked. Ultimately, the mom just wanted her photos to be humorous, honest and relatable to other parents. “It’s OK to admit that you are tired sometimes. None of us are perfect,” she said. “Even though our kids sometimes tell us that they wish we were like this mom or that mom, I can promise you that those moms hear the same thing about you.”Gardner wants parents to stop being so hard on themselves: “Don’t worry about what other parents are doing ‘better’ than you. Be yourself. Have fun. Laugh with your kids. Make family time a priority. They won’t be kids long.”She added, “Oh, and when I see you in the grocery store with your screaming kid and your eye is twitching because you could lose your crap at any second, I’m not going to judge you because that was possibly me last week.”"

41,PARENTS,Mom And Dad Take Hilariously Relatable Back-To-School Photos,Caroline Bologna,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mom-and-dad-take-hilariously-relatable-back-to-school-photos_us_599609e7e4b0e8cc855c76dd,Parents are loving this family's annual tradition.,2017-08-18,"“We are a pretty comical family, so we gave up on traditional family pictures a long time ago,” she told HuffPost.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5996ff6014000020002c3706.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For parents, the first day of school can bring feelings of sadness and nostalgia, but mostly it seems to be pure jubilation. That’s certainly the case for Keshia Gardner. The Alabama mom shared some hilarious photos her family took in honor of back-to-school season. Gardner has been taking these “jump for joy” photos since 2013. “We are a pretty comical family, so we gave up on traditional family pictures a long time ago,” she told HuffPost.“And I wanted to cheer up my friends that were sad because their babies started kindergarten. I remember how hard that day was for me,” she added.The photos were taken at the family’s farm, where they are currently building their new home. Although her husband, Andrew, usually takes the photos, Gardner decided to bring him in front of the camera this year ― a change that took some persuasion. “The first thing that he said was ‘I will do it with you, but I’m not jumping!’ So, the only other logical thing for him to do was to soak in the water trough ― which was his idea,” Gardner explained. For Gardner, the back-to-school season can be hectic. “We are a blended family consisting of biological, step- and foster children. We have fostered over 40 children within the last 10 years,” she explained. The mom said her kids love taking the annual photo and seeing how much joy and laughter it brings people on social media. “I think they really enjoy laughing at me trying to jump over and over,” Gardner said. Though the photo is staged, the mom said she really does feel such joy and relief when the school year starts. “It’s not because I don’t love my kids, but for me, it’s because we function better in a routine,” she explained. “Summer is hard when you work full time. Parenting is hard.”With that in mind, Gardner believes parents have a lot to celebrate when the first day of school rolls around. “The dreaded school shopping is over, juggling babysitters is over, refereeing arguments over the remote control or whose turn it is to watch their show is over,” she said. “Receiving ‘I’m bored’ texts a million times a day, while you are at work, over. Trying to make enough money to keep up with their summer food demands, over.”Although Gardner said she faced some mom-shaming for her photos, she just brushed it aside. “I mean, they haven’t taken my teenager shopping, so ...” she joked.

Reclaiming — and, in many instances, uncovering — her sexual identity after backlash for early career choices, Hill said, shaped new album Like a Woman.“I had a really good awakening in the past year that I was kind of avoiding for a long time,” Hill said of a growing understanding of her own sexuality on a recent episode of Party Foul Radio with Pollo & Pearl. “I wouldn’t call myself completely ‘straight.’” Like a Woman, which debuted June 30 via Kanye West’s G.O.O.D. Music label, has been lauded by some as a work of female sexual empowerment. According to the 23-year-old, though, that was never the intention. Instead, she described recording the 12-song collection as “a really personal experience.”“I don’t think I was trying to make this big statement about female sexuality in general,” Hill told Podomatic’s No. 1 LGBTQ Podcast. “In a lot of ways, I wrote it to myself,” Hill said of the thought-provoking body of “vulnerable,” often pensive tracks for which lead single “Hard to Love” serves as “pop salvation.” “This period of my life was interesting, because I was figuring out my own sexuality and what I want.”During a 20-minute interview, Hill discussed frequently negative response to work for American Apparel, being mentored by album head West and depicting public masturbation in the “Like a Woman” video. A significant focus, though, became her sexuality.“Everything is kind of open-ended at this point,” said Hill of her orientation. “I’m not married to any gender. It’s kind of nice.”WATCH: Kacy Hill’s Dance-Pop Gem “Hard to Love”By her own description, Hill identifies as “kind of fluid.” Others of her generation are also embracing the idea that there are “so many nuances” to sexuality, the Phoenix native opined.“More people are realizing you don’t really have to be married to, ‘I am straight and only attracted to people of the opposite gender!’” she said. “The last year was an interesting journey for me in discovering ‘Oh, I have feelings for women, and I have feelings for men.’ It’s OK to have all of those things.”It was confirmation, Hill conceded, of ideas she has long considered but “been afraid to acknowledge.” Her hesitation, it was implied, came partially from growing up in “more conservative” Arizona and lessons learned from reactions to her modeling career by those close to her. In her late teens, Hill appeared in several campaigns for retailer American Apparel. Before the current “Free the Nipple movement,” as she referred to it, several spreads featured sheer tops or lingerie. Though she had no problem with the photos, Hill said friends, family and even strangers on the internet had other opinions.“It made me feel icky,” Hill said of how others “took ownership” of the images, adding “their own narrative” to the pictures. WATCH: Kacy Hill Masturbates on a Bus in “Like a Woman”Many expressed discomfort with the work – “’Oh, I didn’t know you were doing that kind of modeling,’” she recalls some saying – which, in turn, made Hill uneasy. She began to internalize others’ feelings and question her choices. The sentiment continued when she began to make music.“It was like, ‘Let’s get all the American Apparel images off-line and we can start you new,’” she recalled. “All of those things combined showed there was definitely a collective shame that I don’t really want to take on.For Hill, her response was as fiery as her hair.“It almost created an uprising in who I am,” she said. When it came time to write and record Like a Woman, the young entertainer wanted to “express who I am as a woman and my sexuality in a way that felt honest and was my own perspective.”“I got to a point where I do not care any more what you feel,” she said of the release. “This is who I am, and I feel good about what I’m doing…I don’t need you listening if you’re uncomfortable with it.”Calling the shift in point-of-view “a breath of fresh air,” her newfound attitude also opened her to other exploration. Though “with a man now,” Hill expressed gratitude for the experiences which provided the “confirmation” she sought about her sexuality. “There is that part of me,” Hill concluded, “And there is this fluidity in me that I’ve been avoiding for a long time.”Follow Party Foul Radio on Twitter.LISTEN: Kacy Hill discusses Like a Woman, Harper Starling talks “Disco Mirror Dream” on Party Foul Radio, Ep. 79."
43,POLITICS,Top Trump Adviser Steve Bannon Out From White House,Sam Levine,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/steve-bannon-out_us_597242dfe4b09e5f6ccf1ac8,He was a conservative force in the West Wing credited with helping to shape Trump's populist appeal.,2017-08-18,Steve Bannon is out as President Donald Trump's chief strategist.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59971f9b2200002d001a6ad3.jpeg?cache=JjMjenZIH3&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Steve Bannon, a senior adviser to the president who was largely credited with shaping the strategy that got Donald Trump to the White House, is out from his role as the president’s chief strategist. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said Bannon and Chief of Staff John Kelly agreed Friday would be his last day.“We are grateful for his service and wish him the best,” Sanders said in a statement.The details of Bannon’s departure remain unclear. The New York Times reported Trump had decided to remove Bannon, but also that a source close to Bannon said the adviser had submitted his resignation on Aug. 7 to be effective Aug. 14. MSNBC’s Stephanie Ruhle also tweeted Bannon is “out.”CNN’s Jim Acosta and Axios’ Jonathan Swan both tweeted Bannon had been fired. Vanity Fair’s Gabriel Sherman tweeted that Bannon was expected to return to Breitbart News, the site espousing white nationalist views that he led before joining Trump’s president campaign.Charlie Spiering, Breitbart’s White House correspondent, said Bannon had returned immediately and chaired an editorial meeting on Friday.Bannon told Bloomberg Businessweek that he is going to fight for Trump “against his opponents ― on Capitol Hill, in the media, and in corporate America.”“If there’s any confusion out there, let me clear it up: I’m leaving the White House and going to war,” he told the outlet.A source close to Bannon told The Atlantic’s Rosie Gray that Bannon is now “fully unchained.”Bannon’s departure comes amid a recent wave of White House staffing shakeups and turmoil. According to Axios, Trump believed that Bannon was behind recent leaks to the press. The president has made stopping leaks a top priority.Backlash over Trump’s response to white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, may have also led to the departure. Former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci on Sunday blamed Trump’s failure to directly call out far-right groups on Bannon. Scaramucci himself was fired after just 10 days on the job, after he forced out then-chief of staff Reince Priebus. Both Bannon and Priebus had strongly objected to Scaramucci’s hiring, and former press secretary Sean Spicer resigned over it.In a statement, the Democratic National Committee said Bannon’s departure would mean “there is one less white supremacist in the White House, but that doesn’t change the man sitting behind the Resolute desk.”“Donald Trump has spent decades fueling hate in communities, including his recent attempts to divide our country and give a voice to white supremacists,” the group said in a statement.Bannon, who left Breitbart to run Trump’s campaign in August 2016, pushed Trump to be loyal to the populist base that got him elected. He was a conservative force in the West Wing who helped draft Trump’s controversial ban on travel and immigration from several Muslim-majority countries.Bannon was once considered one of the most influential members of Trump’s inner circle, but he has receded from public view in recent months. After his feud with Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, became public earlier this year, Trump urged the two to work it out. Politico also reported Trump was upset over a new book highlighting the importance of Bannon’s role in Trump’s presidential campaign.Bannon also gave a bizarre interview this week to The American Prospect, a progressive publication, calling white supremacists a “collection of clowns” and contradicted Trump’s military threats to North Korea. In April, when Bannon and Kushner feuded, Trump downplayed Bannon’s role during his presidential campaign, portraying him as someone who took over in the homestretch and whom he didn’t know well.Bannon once pledged to fight for the “deconstruction of the administrative state.” He long assailed establishment Republicans and reportedly called House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) a “limp-dick motherfucker” when there was talk of pushing Ryan to challenge Trump’s claim to the Republican nomination.Progressives long protested Bannon’s elevation to his role as Trump’s chief strategist, citing his offensive views. Following Trump’s apparent refusal to denounce the white nationalist protesters in Charlottesville, they renewed their calls to “fire Bannon.”Leaders of the congressional black, Asian, Hispanic and progressive caucuses also had sent a letter to the White House demanding the dismissal of Bannon along with aides Stephen Miller and Sebastian Gorka, saying their presence in the White House emboldened white supremacists across the country. The letter came after Trump faced criticism for initially condemning “all sides” after the violent protests in Charlottesville. “Americans deserve to know that white nationalists, white supremacists, and neo-Nazis are not in a position to influence U.S. policy,” the letter said. “That is why we continue to find Steve Bannon’s presence in your administration incredibly alarming and dangerous to our nation and the world, and once again, we urge you to immediately remove Steve Bannon from the White House altogether. As you know, Mr. Bannon is the co-founder of the white nationalist, ‘alt-right’ website, Breitbart News. Under his direction and approval, this site published blatantly bigoted rhetoric about women, Muslims, and other minorities. It is no wonder that white nationalist groups, such as the KKK, have praised Mr. Bannon’s extreme political statements.”This article has been updated with more details about Bannon’s departure from the White House and return to Breitbart."

Drawing on their Nazi credo, they shouted “Jews will not replace us” and “blood and soil,” among other racist diatribes. The closest they came to spewing direct attacks against the Latino community was when they chanted “One people, one nation ― end immigration,” considering that millions of Latinos are immigrants or children of immigrants. But as Ilia Calderón’s interview with members of the Ku Klux Klan can attest, Latinos are not immune from white supremacists’ hate. As one of the largest minority populations (in size) in the United States, it’s our responsibility to stand up and speak out against white supremacists. Now is not the time to say it’s not our fight.Our history’s place in the United States is complex and diverse, but there is one thing that remains constant in our shared experience: we have had to fight for our civil rights and against racial discrimination. While many of our ancestors in the Southwest and Florida were in this country long before the Mayflower landed on Plymouth Rock, as a whole, our community has historically been the target of legal and de-facto discrimination. We were used as scapegoats for the nation’s economic woes in Operation Wetback and beaten to a pulp in the Zoot Suit Riots of East Los Angeles during World War II. Hidden in the shadows of a history relegated to specialized Mexican-American college courses are the hundreds of Mexican lynchings that took place in Texas and the Southwest during the 19th and 20th centuries. Mexicans were not allowed to use public segregated establishments such as schools, pools, restaurants and public restrooms. We’ve been branded as an “other” to fear and to use as a rationalization for the nation’s maladies. This oppression came by the hands of men who thought like Trump, Stephen Miller and David Duke.In the face of oppression, we didn’t sit back and watch. Leaders sprang from within our Latino communities from Texas to California and, taking cues from the courage of the African-American Civil Rights Movement, we fought to take our rightful place in a nation that we have helped shape with our hard work and contributions. We organized. We wrote. We marched. Our hard work paid off, and our community prospered under the cloak of hard-fought equality. Our milestones came one after another, from the first Latina in the Supreme Court to the first Latina in the United States Senate, and everyday victories for the countless Latinos who contribute to the labor force. The day Trump slid down the Trump tower escalator and called Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals marked a terrible milestone that launched a campaign for the presidency that to this day continues to attack us.The same ideology that prompted restaurants to post “No Dogs and No Mexicans Allowed” signs, and the same laws that allowed policy like Operation Wetback in the 1950s is the same one that lurks in Trump and Miller and Gorka’s White House. It’s the same ideology that appeared dressed as disaffected white supremacists and shrieking racist chants like a mad banshee in Charlottesville. They don’t want people of color or immigrants, among many other groups they consider inferior, and Latinos are on their list of “undesirables.” The Southern Poverty Law Center, for instance, found that discussions on Stormfront, a white supremacist website, were mostly centered on Latinos and African-Americans. The same fringe extremist groups that surface during heated national immigration debates now have a national stage and they will not differentiate between a Latino immigrant and an American of Latino descent.We are all on the receiving end of their attacks, and to survive, we must look to the leaders before us. We must not sit back and watch. It’s our duty as Latinos to stand with our African-American and Jewish sisters and brothers. It’s our duty as Americans to stand up and defend our nation from the gangrene that is white supremacy and Nazism. Latinos have contributed to this nation in the ballot box, in the businesses that employ millions, in the classrooms where we teach, in the literature we write, in the movies we direct, and in the policy we enact. Now, we must contribute with our voice in the resistance."

McGovern-Dole, run by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, issued a grant to Catholic Relief Services (CRS) to provide school meals in Laos.In the following interview Jessica Garrels of CRS Laos updates us on how this food for education plan is doing. She also warns of the possibility the program could be eliminated in budget cuts proposed by the Trump administration.How many children are receiving school meals from CRS in Laos?Under our initial project from the United States Dept. of Agriculture (USDA) that started in September of 2012 and ran until this May, nearly 36,000 primary-school students were served across six districts in Savannakhet Province, which is located in the southern part of the country.Under our current project from USDA, which began last October and will continue until 2021, some 40,000 primary-school students will be served meals across seven districts in Savannakhet Province.Can you describe the impact of the meals on child nutrition and class attendance?The final evaluation on our first project showed that student hunger decreased dramatically over the course of the project. In fact, at the beginning of the project, when students were asked about their hunger levels during the school day, nearly half of the students reported being ‘hungry’ or ‘very hungry’ as compared with only eight percent of students at the end of the project. The ration per student for the first project consisted of rice, Vitamin-A fortified vegetable oil, and lentils or green-split pea, plus any condiments, vegetables, or other extras provided by the community. For example, a typical meal could consist of rice soup or fried rice.Another finding from the final evaluation showed that students became more ‘attentive’ by the end of the project, from 68% at the beginning of the project to nearly 90% at the end of the project.And, teachers reported that students attended school more regularly, from 67% of teachers reporting regular attendance to 86% at the end of the project. In particular, teachers and parents both noted that, before the project, students would go home for lunch and not come back for the afternoon sessions; they reported that afternoon attendance greatly improved after the introduction of school meals and other activities. This is very important in terms of improved literacy as ‘time on task’ is an important factor in student success.Further, our final evaluation revealed that 60% of parents reported that school feeding was an important factor in the decision to send their children to school. Parents noted the following benefits: It enabled parents to work through the whole day; it reduced the pressure on household finances; children remained at school the whole day and did not ‘skip’ afternoon classes; and children were enthusiastic about going to school.Are the school meals funded by the United States McGovern-Dole program?Yes – CRS receives commodities from USDA sufficient to provide a school meal each day of the school year. USDA also provides direct funding to support other activities included in the project – for example, training for teachers to improve their skills in teaching reading and writing.Is there enough funding to continue the meals the rest of the year?Congress passed a final FY17 appropriations bill in May that provided level funding for McGovern-Dole programs compared to the previous year. In the Administration’s budget request for FY18, however, the Administration proposed zeroing out all funding for McGovern-Dole. We know there are many in Congress that support this program though, and we hope they will continue to do so in FY18.How can someone help CRS in Laos?The best way to support CRS in Laos is to donate to the organization. Fortunately, we are able to work with competent staff on the ground and have access to robust marketplaces in larger towns, so that enables us to use contributions to support the local workforce and economy. Contributions enable us to complement the funds already received – for example, contributions could help us do a study to better understand the connection between student handwashing with soap and a reduction in student absences. Or, they could enable us to respond to an unanticipated, in-country emergency such as flooding or landslides.People could also let their Congressional representatives know that they support the U.S. funding programs like McGovern-Dole. At the end of the day, it is Congress that makes the final decision on whether these programs continue or end, since it controls the government’s purse-strings."

Then, as now, we have a builder of boundless optimism, who seeks to usher in a new era of shared prosperity all across this new world.”This comparison might seem deeply flawed, but it is pretty spot-on in some ways.Take both presidents’ records on race, for example. Trump spent the weekend facing criticism for saying there was violence “on both sides” of a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that left one woman dead. He doubled down on those comments in the following days, suggesting that there were “very fine people” among protesters marching with torches and neo-Nazi regalia, and lamented a growing movement to remove Confederate monuments from public spaces.History has not looked kindly on Roosevelt’s racist statements. He referred to white Americans as the “forward race,” and believed that it was white people’s “responsibility to raise the status of minorities through training the backward race[s] in industrial efficiency, political capacity and domestic morality.”One way these two are not alike? Roosevelt is considered by some to be a “war hero” for his role in the Spanish-American War. Trump, in contrast, had five military deferments during the Vietnam War ― but he still has strong opinions on those who have served. He’s also happy to take credit for the Panama Canal, constructed partly during Roosevelt’s presidency.Another fun comparison is that Roosevelt used to use the word “bully” as a congratulatory exclamation. That’s not exactly how we use it now, but it’s still a word many associate with the president."

The two had a conversation for Teen Vogue in which they discussed some of the obstacles they’ve faced. The actresses acknowledged that they’ve had roles that break the mold of how black women are traditionally portrayed on screen (Stenberg in “Everything, Everything” and Monáe in “Moonlight” and “Hidden Figures”), yet they realize there is still work to be done. The 18-year-old told Monáe that the predominately white industry can be a “scary world” to try to figure out. Monáe agreed. “I’m probably just as scared as you. I actually look to you for inspiration,” she said. “I remember watching your ‘Don’t Cash Crop My Cornrows’ video and feeling like, Wow, here is a young girl who is going to be a beacon of hope for not only young black girls but all human beings who are just uncomfortable speaking out and walking in their truth.”They pivoted to social issues outside of Hollywood, and Monáe asked Stenberg where she was on election night. Stenberg recalled being on the set of “Where Hands Touch,” a film in which she plays a biracial girl growing up during the Holocaust. “In the scene, my character’s papers get taken away by a Nazi officer and the officer yells in her face, basically telling her that she does not belong in her own country,” she said. “An actor playing a Nazi soldier took out his phone to refresh the news and announced that Trump was president. I was actually seeing this come out of the mouth of an actor dressed in a Nazi uniform. Immediately, I excused myself because I felt like I couldn’t breathe anymore.”She remembered crying and questioning how the United States got to such a divisive point. “The director, Amma Asante, came to check on me, and she told me that progress is like a coil you have to go down in order to circle back up again. That’s how it’s worked throughout history,” she said. “That’s how it will continue to work.”Monáe shared that she was on the outskirts of Atlanta on election night. She said that there were parts of that area where the KKK is still active. “After the results were announced, I thought, Am I going to be safe?” she said.Despite the hatred, Stenberg emphasized how vital it is to practice self-care and remain confident in herself.“I feel like now is the time to stand tall and feel 100 percent comfortable in my skin even though I’m occupying a space that I know historically wasn’t built for me,” she said.

50,QUEER VOICES,"Yes, There's Actually A 'Straight Lives Matter' Rally In The Works",Curtis M. Wong,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/straight-lives-matter-rally_us_5994a818e4b06ef724d6030d,Sigh. Just... sigh.,2017-08-18,"Though Australians have shown wide support for marriage equality, the nation has been at odds over how to legally recognize same-sex unions. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5994ab3d22000009371a6582.jpeg?cache=gHJzbvGKnF&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A group of same-sex marriage opponents are planning to co-opt the Black Lives Matter movement by staging a “Straight Lives Matter” rally in Australia. Members of Australia’s Party for Freedom, which supports “traditional Australian values, family values, and the protection and preservation of Australian sovereignty and independence,” announced plans for the rally in a Tuesday Facebook post. The Sept. 23 rally, the post read, will take place in Sydney’s Darlinghurst neighborhood, which boasts a vibrant LGBTQ community. Australia has the dubious distinction of being the only developed, English-speaking nation that has yet to legalize same-sex marriage. While Aussie voters have expressed wide support for marriage equality, the nation’s government has been conflicted over how to legally grant same-sex couples the right to marry.If Party for Freedom chairman Nick Folkes has his way, however, LGBTQ couples won’t be tying the knot in Australia anytime soon. “We believe tradition is important,” he wrote in the post, which can be viewed below. “The biological institution of marriage should not be redefined to suit a minority sexual orientation.” Party for Freedom members expanded on their opposition to marriage equality in an Aug. 13 blog on the group’s official website. “Legalizing homosexual marriage will open a ‘Pandora’s box’ to polygamy and the possible lowering of the age of consent for sex,” they wrote. “Gay marriage is the latest fad pushed by the left-wing politicians, left wing media, cashed up gay rights groups and social justice warriors under the modern perversion of ‘rights’ as a social justice movement.”The blog also tried to present much of Professor Mark Regnerus’s controversial and discredited 2012 study on same-sex parenting as fact, adding, “The gay rights movement is based on compassion ignoring the dangers the lifestyle experiment may pose to children.” Given these arguments, the group’s justification for a “Straight Lives Matter” is laughably weak, as same-sex marriage has been proven to have zero effect on opposite-sex unions whatsoever. (Repeat: zero.) Whether or not the planned rally will sway Australian voters, however, remains to be seen. Last week, the nation’s government called for “an extraordinary mail-in vote” to determine whether or not same-sex couples will be allowed to legally marry, The New York Times reported. The ballots will be mailed to residents Sept. 12, with the results expected on Nov. 25. UPDATE Aug. 21: Folkes released a statement to HuffPost, which read: We are holding the ‘Straight Lives Matter’ rally to encourage Australians to vote ‘no’ in the upcoming same sex marriage postal vote. I do not support the push to redefine marriage by amending the Marriage Act. Traditional marriage is a cultural, religious and historical institution that needs to be preserved to protect children and families. Legalizing same sex marriage will open a ‘Pandora’s box’ to those seeking to normalize polygamy and multi parent marriage arrangements.Find ways to combat bigotry by subscribing to the Queer Voices newsletter.

The United States has suddenly slid down the slippery slope towards genocide in a noticeable way. This week’s top headlines echo those that could have been published in Rwanda in the years leading up to the genocide: “Claiming ‘Moral Victory,’ Far Right Surges Into View,” “The Hate He Dares Not Speak Of,” “How a Conservative TV Giant Is Ridding Itself of Regulation.”In Rwanda in the early 1990s, the single-party state of President Habyarimana faced a political impasse. Fearful of losing their monopoly on power, an inner circle of Hutu political leaders, military officers, and businessmen who hailed from the president’s home region began to organize populist political protests touting Hutu unity and anti-Tutsi propaganda. Among the president’s inner circle of advisors were: his wife, Agathe Kanziga and her relatives, some of whom held official positions while others operated secretly behind the scenes; Hutu extremist businessman, Felicien Kabuga, who financed new media outlets espousing extremist views; and Hutu propagandist, Hassan Ngeze; as well as faithful supporters placed strategically throughout the government and military at all levels.Similarly, President Trump includes among his inner circle of senior advisors: his daughter and son-in-law; Steve Bannon, the former editor of Breitbart News, a right-wing website that “pushed racist, xenophobic and anti-Semitic material”; Sebastian Gorka, a former Breitbart employee and self-proclaimed terrorism expert with dubious credentials and who has been linked to a Nazi-allied group in Hungary; and Corey Lewandowski, a political operative who has flouted federal law and used his personal relationship with the president to lobby on behalf of foreign and domestic corporations and other entities. The inclusion of Bannon and Gorka in Trump’s inner circle signal to white supremacist groups that the president is on their side. The fusion of power and personal relationships in the White House and in the president’s broader circle impedes transparency, a hallmark of a liberal democracy.Last Friday night, neo-Nazis, the KKK and other white supremacist groups marched through the University of Virginia campus carrying torches and shouting the Nazi slogan “blood and soil” and the anti-Semitic chant “Jews will not replace us.” The title of Saturday’s march, “Unite the Right,” and the event’s message of “white nationalism” evoked the infamous speak of Leon Mugesera in 1992, where the first coded messages of genocide were spread in Rwanda: “Unite … do not let yourselves be invaded.”In Rwanda, the Interahamwe militias who became the frontline killers during the genocide began innocuously as a group of soccer fanatics who supported the same team. Through shady financing from anonymous businessmen, the Interahamwe evolved into a nationwide movement. In 1992 and 1993, Interahamwe gangs attacked and killed hundreds of Tutsi and along with Hutu members of the political opposition. In official statements, local authorities called for calm and promised investigations into the “spontaneous ethnic killings.” The investigations went nowhere; the perpetrators were never held accountable. Unlike the Interahamwe, the white supremacist, white nationalists, and so-called “alt-right” groups who marched in Virginia already have a well-organized ideology of hate to fuel their violence. We should not forget: the KKK is the largest terrorist organization in history. The men and women who came to march for “white nationalism” on Saturday came well-armed and ready to fight. James Alex Fields Jr.’s act of terrorism and alleged murder of Heather Heyer left no doubt of the latent potential for mass violence within the white supremacist marchers’ ranks.President Trump uses Twitter much in the same way President Habyarimana and Hutu extremists used the brash, new radio and newspapers known for their intentionally shocking style of racism passed off as so-called “frank talk” about identity politics. On Monday and again Tuesday, President Trump rebuked Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier on Twitter after Frazier resigned from the president’s manufacturing council writing that “America’s leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy.” This incident follows the patterns established during his presidential campaign, where he repeatedly threatened “Crooked Hillary,” “Lyin’ Ted” and “fake news,” showing the “alt-right” who to target. Likewise, the Hutu extremist media publicly identified anyone, whether Hutu or Tutsi, who publicly criticized President Habyarimana’s or Hutu extremist political parties. Steve Bannon’s disavowal of the “alt-right: as “losers,” “fringe elements” and “a collection of clowns” mirrors Rwandan officials’ dismissals of Interahamwe as youth gangs while the same officials simultaneously armed and trained them.The United States is still a long way from genocide, but its elements have taken root. To keep from slipping on this dangerous slope, Americans of all races must continue to come out and oppose bigotry, discrimination, racism, and hate speech. White Americans, in particular, must publicly decry white supremacist ideology each and every time it appears. Do not think your rejection of racism or white supremacy can be assumed. The so-called white nationalist ideology of the “alt-right” needs to be shown for what it is: racism dressed up as pride in an ethnic heritage or as an odd flavor of Christianity. Elected leaders and officials from both parties must continue to speak against white supremacy and its false promises. Republicans must continue to pressure the president to turn away from these dangerous people he views as his base. President Trump must remove all people with connections to the alt-right from the White House and from any position where they might appear to have influence over policy or law. President Trump must stop pandering to white supremacists and the alt-right through deceptive equivocations, cunning omissions, stilted condemnations, and retracted denunciations that fail to upend what they see as his “true message” of populist violence delivered at rallies throughout his presidential campaign."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59958d2c2700003100d4f73e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BUSIA, Uganda (Reuters) - The number of South Sudanese refugees in Uganda hit one million on Thursday, the United Nations said, as hundreds of desperate families pour across the border every day seeking a haven from the civil war.The conflict in South Sudan has created Africa’s biggest refugee crisis since the 1994 Rwandan genocide, and U.N. agencies are receiving a fraction of the cash they need to provide food and shelter.But the crowds keep flowing across rickety wooden bridges near the northwestern Ugandan border town of Busia, staggering under the weight of babies and a few pots or bundles of clothing balanced on their heads.Women and children make up more than 85 percent of the arrivals.“Two weeks ago my husband’s uncle was killed,” said Stella Taji, as she trudged barefoot over the bridge, a toddler clinging to her hand. “Since then we’ve been hiding in the bush. We have nothing.”Oil-rich South Sudan became the world’s youngest nation in 2011, upon its independence from neighboring Sudan, but the elation soon evaporated amid corruption and ethnic divisions.Troops loyal to President Salva Kiir, a Dinka, and forces under former vice president Riek Machar, from the Nuer ethnic group, have battled each other since late 2013, killing tens of thousands and forcing nearly a third of the population of 12 million to flee their homes.The trickle of refugees into Uganda swelled into a river last year after a shaky Western-backed peace deal between Kiir and Machar collapsed within months.The conflict has further fragmented since, breeding a patchwork of militias and briefly plunging parts of the country into famine this year.No one knows how many have died, but an August report by South Africa-based South Sudan Human Rights Observatory said 987 civilians were killed in violence across South Sudan between May and July, mostly by government forces.“They are slaughtering people with knives,” said Samuel Amule, who trekked for two days to the border to escape government attacks. “They say, ‘If you are staying here, you are a rebel.’”The U.N. says homes have been burned with families locked inside, gang rapes are common and boys are often kidnapped to be child soldiers. Gunmen, including South Sudanese rebels, rob those trying to escape.In Uganda, South Sudanese refugees receive hot meals, vaccinations, and plots of land. All can enter and they are free to travel and work in Uganda, policies that have drawn praise from aid groups."

President Donald Trump has said that thousands of people were bused into the state to vote on Election Day, but hasn't provided any evidence to back up his claim.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5995b0cc2700003100d4f7c3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Two former campaign aides to President Donald Trump have launched Look Ahead America, a group focused on increasing voter registration and stopping voter fraud.Matt Braynard and Witold Chrabaszcz, former members of the Trump campaign’s data team, started the group to register “rural and blue-collar patriotic Americans who are disaffected and disenfranchised from the nation’s corridors of power,” according to the Look Ahead America website. Braynard left the Trump campaign in April 2016, and Chrabaszcz was tapped to temporarily replace him. Chrabaszcz had little experience with political strategy, Politico noted at the time.Look Ahead America is technically nonpartisan. But Braynard told The New York Times, which first reported on the group’s formation, that the organization aims to register new voters not unlike those who supported Trump in the 2016 election. Its board of advisers consists of nearly 40 Trump campaign alumni, and it does not have to disclose donors because it is registered as a 501(c)(3).Look Ahead America says it plans to “apply data forensics” to watch out for indications that ballots were cast by undocumented immigrants, noncitizens or deceased residents. It also plans to give people recording equipment to “document illegal voting.”Braynard disputed critics’ suggestion that surveillance at polling places would intimidate voters.“I don’t buy that at all. You can’t walk down the street without being on 20 different cameras,” he told HuffPost. “I think it’s in everybody’s best interest that there are third parties monitoring elections and who’s voted and who hasn’t voted who all can agree that ’Hey, this was a clean election.′ And I think that’s in everybody’s interest.”Braynard said the group’s primary focus would be using new processes and technology to focus on enfranchisement. He declined to comment on whether the group would get behind efforts to push automatic voter registration, something nine states and the District of Columbia have already adopted in hopes of increasing the number of registered voters, because he said he didn’t know enough about it yet.Look Ahead America is nearing an $800,000 fundraising goal to start a pilot program in Virginia ahead of the state’s gubernatorial and state house elections this year, according to the Times. The organization plans to use “psychographic modeling” on voter data to identify voters to register.Trump has pushed to end voter fraud, even though multiple studies and investigations have shown that is not a widespread issue. The president has repeatedly said that he would have won the popular vote had it not been for 3 million to 5 million people who voted illegally, but he hasn’t offered any evidence to support that claim. During the presidential campaign, he also undermined confidence in the election by saying the contest was “rigged.”The president has said that thousands of people were bused into New Hampshire to vote on Election Day, but state officials have said there’s no evidence that’s true. (Still, the state tightened its residency requirements for voting in July.) Trump has also convened a panel to probe voter fraud, a move that has raised serious alarm among Democrats and voting rights groups, particularly after the commission requested voter data from all 50 states. Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R) ― who has a history of making exaggerated claims of voter fraud and is being sued over one of the most restrictive voting laws in the country ― leads the commission and has said the committee would would eventually destroy any data it obtained. Several other members have a history of alleging voter fraud in an effort to make it easier to purge people from the voter rolls.Dale Ho, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s voting rights project, said Look Ahead America is poised to undermine its own goal of increasing voter participation.“At a time when public confidence in elections is being threatened by lies about widespread illegal voting, this group is undermining its own purported goal of encouraging voter participation,” he said in a statement. “We whole-heartedly support any efforts to increase voter participation and civic engagement by all Americans, but spreading lies about illegal voting only undermines public confidence in our elections. We should be doing more, not less, to encourage participation.”Derrick Robinson, a spokesman for the liberal-leaning Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, also said the group would suppress votes.“This reported plan of action has nothing to do with voter fraud and everything to do with intimidation designed to stop people from voting,” he said in a statement. “It is part and parcel of a larger plan, aligned with this administration and burnished by the racist-tinged rhetoric of this President, to suppress votes, particularly those of minority communities.”This article has been updated with comment from Braynard.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5994989314000020002c31db.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Two Angelenos of different ethnic and religious backgrounds find love against the odds in Brandon Stansell’s latest music video, “Spare Change.”HuffPost got an exclusive look at the new video, in which a subway meet cute turns out to be a topical lesson in inclusion. While Stansell’s two previous videos, “Slow Down” and “Never Know,” addressed the Los Angeles-based singer-songwriter’s sexuality by showing him embrace ― and eventually lose ― male love interests, he opted for a political approach this time around. Noting that “Spare Change” was “not written for any political purpose,” Stansell said he and director Trent Atkinson see the video as an act of “joyful resistance” that takes the concerns many in the LGBTQ community and other minority groups have about their future under President Donald Trump into account. “For me, releasing anything but a response to the atrocious policies of this administration seemed like an opportunity wasted,” he told HuffPost. “To fight back, we have to continue to have the courage to band together and build community around the things that make life precious: art, beauty, love, and free expression.” As the third and final track on Stansell’s 2016 “Slow Down” EP to receive the video treatment, “Spare Change” also marks the start of a new era for the 30-year-old “California country” artist. He’s slated to return to the studio next week to record his first full-length album, on which he’ll collaborate with country star Ty Herndon. He’s also launched a Kickstarter campaign, which can be viewed here, to help fund the 10-song album’s release. “There are some fun, light-hearted things about the album, as well as songs with a bit more gravitas – and like many of my songs, they are reflective of deeply personal experiences,” Stansell told HuffPost. One new tune, “Hometown,” is inspired by his early struggles with his sexuality while growing up in Tennessee. “It speaks to something a lot of gay people struggle with: how to reconcile the ideas and culture of where you grew up and your family life with your identity,” he said. One thing Stansell won’t do, however, is take the advice of some critics who feel artists and musicians should steer clear of politics. “For me, artistry and advocacy go hand in hand,” he explained, “and making this full album has given me the chance to give each of those things equal weight.”Catch the latest in LGBTQ culture by subscribing to the Queer Voices newsletter.

Katie Sones, Lipslut’s founder, explained she plans to donate 100 percent of August proceeds to “support recent victims.” “At the end of August, we plan to both assess which organizations/individuals are in need, and reach out to our followers on social media to get a sense of where they want us to donate,” she said. “We will most likely donate directly to victims’ medical funds, as well as local organizations such as Albemarle-Charlottesville NAACP, BLM Charlottesville, and several others in the area.”The single shade of liquid lipstick, a matte pink aptly named “F*ck Trump,” is cruelty-free and will set you back $19.95.Sones told HuffPost that the company’s charity campaign will move forward as usual after the month of August. She said it has already raised $25,000 since its inception.“The support has been amazing,” she said. “Seeing others come out and say they agree with what we are trying to do is a dream come true, and I love being able to deliver a product they not only love, but are proud to stand behind, too.”"
57,BLACK VOICES,The Role Of White Millennials In Charlottesville,"Brianna K. Parker, ContributorFounding Curator of the Black Millennial Cafe",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/we-cannot-outgrow-racism-the-role-of-white-millennials_us_5995c6ede4b055243ea1369b,Racism will not end when the racists of the '60s die.,2017-08-17,<p>White Auburn University students at a Halloween party in Black-face mimicking the worst of America’s history as fun.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5995dcf514000023002c34da.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For decades, our nation has witnessed changing demographics, with people of color now presumed to be in the racial majority by the year 2060. With rapidly changing demographics – including greater numbers of people who are farther removed from slavery, reconstruction and Jim Crow ― it can be tempting to think younger generations will automatically be more tolerant and progressive than their ancestors. But for those who seek comfort in thinking racism can be eviscerated with younger, more diverse generations, the violent mob in Charlottesville, Virginia was led by white millennials, some of them likely members of the Ku Klux Klan. This was cemented with the unforgettable image of angry white nationalist, Peter Cvjetanovic, a 20-year-old University of Nevada student.For those who believed that millennials couldn’t be as violent or reckless as previous generations, Charlottesville had to have been quite a sight. James Alex Fields Jr., a 20-year-old white nationalist from Ohio, allegedly rammed his car into demonstrators, killing one woman, Heather Heyer, and injuring 19 others. Moreover, the massacre at Mother Emanuel AME Church was carried out by a white millennial, Dylann Roof. Nine African American churchgoers lost their lives to someone who, at age 18, hadn’t lived out half of his own.While millennials have not consistently followed the path of prior generations –marrying at a young age, leaving their parents’ home upon graduation or settling on one or two careers – some have clearly embraced racism as though it were part of a familial legacy.Charlottesville appeared to have been a symbolic and literal passing of the torch, as young white men clad in white shirts and kakis stormed the town carrying Tiki torches. Their fore-parents carried burning torches, and white millennials carried Tiki torches. It’s reasonable to wonder whether the image of white millennials brazenly embracing xenophobia and racial hatred warmed the hearts of prior generations.It’s obvious that one can age out of schools, grow out of clothes and promote to different positions, but it’s impossible to outgrow racism. Racism will not end when the racists of the ’60s die. While some people may be more discreet and others less vocal, President Donald J. Trump’s appeals to “Make America Great Again” was a dog whistle meant to unite the worst elements in our society. It was a rallying cry to remove the collars, uniforms, dockers or scrubs to head to Home Depot, grab the hoods if necessary, to pick up the torches of elders and yell, “Long Live Hatred!”Sadly, Charlottesville was a reminder that people of color were tolerated during our childhood, accepted for necessary appropriation in college and not consistently promoted at work because the hateful live among us. It was a reminder that anyone can harbor hate; the white millennials who stormed the streets of Charlottesville were likely school counselors, professors, social workers, doctors, lawyers, police officers and pilots who daily interact with people from different ethnic backgrounds. It reminded some that we may not get the best medical treatment, not solely because of Congressional Republicans’ attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but because our doctors may very well have been some of ones parading through Charlottesville with firm held beliefs that they are better than others simply because of the color of their skin.We were reminded that our children may go to school with needs beyond our understanding and receive no guidance because their counselors believe they are inferior or undeserving of assistance. It was a reminder that we stand before our peers with smiling faces and cautious optimism as they smile back, some harboring white supremacist beliefs as well as a desire to bring harm on communities of color.What does it mean to see the parade of angry white millennials in a typical American city? It means we have not created a better America for our children. Be not deceived... racism will not age out. Seeds of hatred sown by the ancestors have harvested in many millennials. America must repent from its wicked ways and original sin or die the death of every great super power before it.The Rev. Dr. Brianna Parker is the curator of Black Millennial Café.

58,RELIGION,Is The White Church the AntiChrist?,"John C. Dorhauer, ContributorGeneral Minister and President of the United Church of Christ",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/is-the-white-church-the-antichrist_us_5995733de4b055243ea13604,"Is the White Church the Anti-Christ? “If there is any contemporary meaning of the Antichrist (or ""the principalities and",2017-08-17,<p>The Rev. Traci Blackmon marching for peace in Charlottesville</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/599573472700001800d4f724.jpg?ops=crop_8_5_712_738%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Is the White Church the Anti-Christ?“If there is any contemporary meaning of the Antichrist (or ""the principalities and powers""), the white church seems to be a manifestation of it.”That is a quote from James Cone’s 1969 work Black Theology and Black Power. I read it in 1986 while I was preparing myself for a life of ministry in a largely white church. That book, along with its companion piece also by Cone For My People convinced me that, while I was not going to leave the white church, I was going to devote my unearned privilege within it calling it to address its ongoing investment in whiteness. Without a clear commitment to telling the truth about the impact and manifestation of white power and white privilege within the church, and within the culture because of what the white church fulminated with both sins of commission and sins of omission, what Cone wrote about it would remain true: if there is any contemporary meaning of the Antichrist, the white church seems to be a manifestation of it. There have been attempts on the part of the white church to distance itself from its racist origins, racist legacy, racist preachers, racist ideologies, racist theologies, racist biblical texts, racist preachers, and racist practices. Current evidence suggests that those attempts are woefully inadequate. As racism continues to infest our culture, white churches throughout the land remain fully complicit in a variety of ways: with a resounding and somewhat remarkable silence that suggests ignorance of the persistent injustice of racism; with a weariness that emerges after trying but failing to end racism; with a cynical resignation that accedes that nothing we do is going to matter anyway; or with outright, blatant racist ideologies that distort Christianity into something truly ugly and utterly abhorrent. The latter was on full display in Charlottesville, Virginia this past weekend. It is not enough for white leaders like me and the church I serve to differentiate ourselves from any brand of Christianity that looks or sounds like the hatred espoused by Nazis and white nationalists and racist bigots like the ones who surrounded the church on Friday night where both Traci Blackmon and Cornell West spoke. Not enough for us to distinguish ourselves from those carrying torches and chanting “Blood and Soil!” and rendering the local police force obliged to hold the worshipers inside the church until they could secure their safety and remove them without threat of terror: no easy task this, given the mob mentality that had erupted and given the legacy of church burnings and murders that their ilk are known for. Hell no, it is not enough for us to say “That is not what we stand for!” Because our current iteration of the Church and of the faith it espouses is replete with its own form of white supremacy that manifests itself in a myriad of offenses that include silence in face of overt acts of white terror; failure to address the epidemic of white cops killing black victims of their profiling; insufficient, inadequate and tepid responses to the continuing manifestations of American racism, which include mass incarceration, the so-called drug war, educational imbalances, gerrymandering, housing discrimination, the distribution of wealth and jobs along clearly racial lines; a lack of critical insight into the impact and manifestation of a white privilege evident at every level of the white church; and the almost universal acceptance of Jesus as a blue-eyed, blond, white man. Every eruption or public manifestation of race hate is another invitation to the white church to put bodies on the front lines to combat a system that they clearly still benefit from being a part of. The Rodney King verdict, the OJ Simpson trial, the shooting of Trayvon Martin by a vigilante, the murders by police of Michael Brown, Kendra James, and Freddie Gray all demonstrated a clear division between the responses of black community leaders and white church leaders. Every one of these moments was an opportunity for white rage to stand in solidarity with black pain – and it didn’t. Our words, never enough to end racism, and even when on the side of justice – only serve to indict us as co-conspirators in the ongoing perpetuation of systems of injustice and oppression that we remain inextricably connected to. Whenever racists like the ones who assembled in Charlottesville gather, they use what they believe about their distorted views of Christianity as both a weapon and a shield. They use the cover of groups like Christian Identity to justify their perverse and destructive hate speech, imagining that what they do and say is in keeping with, if not a fully obedient response to, the teachings of Christianity. More moderate and progressive Christians deplore that, but don’t really mobilize anything close to a collective, organized, and successful effort to disown it. Brian McLaren recently wrote in a reflection on his trip to Charlottesville for the Nazi rally. In it, he writes: “We Christians, in particular, need to face the degree to which white Christianity has failed – grievously, tragically, unarguably failed – to teach its white adherents to love their non-white neighbors as themselves.” (here is the link to his blog post)As an elected leader of an historically white denomination that has been struggling through the decades to live more fully into its declaration to become a multi-racial, multi-cultural church, I am fully and faithfully committed to eradicating our lingering addiction to white privilege and to leveraging our full capacity as an agent for racial equity. But that is an ongoing struggle: whites in America, even Christian leaders in a fairly progressive denomination, have proven either unable or unwilling to dismantle systems that oppress people of color. It is one thing to enjoin a battle to end racism. It is one thing to march in support of Black Lives Matter. It is one thing to read about or study the impact and manifestation of privilege.It is one thing to rail against a racist president and government that have recreated safe space for Nazis and white nationalists to flourish in again – to crawl out of whatever caves they have been hiding in like vermin for decades now. It is another thing entirely to actively participate in the dismantling of institutions like our schools, our churches, and our government which, as they were being built, were inculcated with racist roots so deep that there is nothing we can do to ‘fix’ them by simply washing away what remains of their racist past. Paul Griffin, in 1999, wrote this in the introduction to his book Seeds of Racism in the Soul of America: “The old seeds of racism have been shown to be sprouting bad fruits all across present day America. Even so, many will continue to heap the bulk of the blame for the persistence of racist ideas on rednecks, white supremacists, and political conservatives. While none of these are immune from blame, racism also continues because the taproot of its early seeds has not yet been cut by white liberals.”When James Cone wrote, in 1969, “If there is any contemporary meaning of the Antichrist (or ""the principalities and powers""), the white church seems to be a manifestation of it,” he was suggesting that the extent to which the white church fails to activate itself as an agent of racial equity, the extent to which it harbors racists and tolerates bigots, the extent to which its addiction to whiteness buys its complicit silence remain the extent to which it is a manifestation of the principalities and powers in our contemporary cultural milieu. To be sure, there were leaders from predominantly white churches and religious bodies demonstrating on the streets of Charlottesville. We are proud of all of them, among them Seth Wispelwey and Brittany Caine-Conley.At some point, though, they have to stop being our outliers. Until they are our norm, and until the mass of resistance to white power, white privilege and white supremacy forms a collective desire among white leaders to deconstruct the very institutions that built white supremacy in the first place, we have to be open to the hard truth James Cone was calling us to face.

Bannon contradicted Trump, saying that “there’s no military solution” to North Korea, despite Trump’s repeated threats to attack the isolated nation.When the subject of the violent white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, came up, Bannon dismissed the group as “a collection of clowns” and claimed that the “media plays it up too much.” “Ethno-nationalism ― it’s losers. It’s a fringe element,” Bannon said, despite having been cited as the driving force between Trump’s courting of the so-called alt-right ― a collection of far-right groups, including neo-Nazis and other white supremacists. As head of Breitbart News, Bannon, who has compared Islam to Nazism, led the website to become a mouthpiece for racism and sexism and a haven for white supremacists.Trump’s response to the events in Charlottesville ― in which he blamed “many sides” for the violence and claimed there were some “fine people” among the neo-Nazis and other far-right groups ― has been resoundingly panned as sympathetic to the white supremacists. But Bannon hinted that such criticism may have been exactly what Trump was going for.“The Democrats,” Bannon said, “the longer they talk about identity politics, I got ’em. I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.”According to Axios, Bannon didn’t know he was giving an on-the-record interview, a claim that The American Prospect seemed to dismiss.“Steve Bannon is not exactly Bambi when it comes to dealing with the press,” Kuttner said. “He’s probably the most media-savvy person in America.”Pressure on Trump to fire Bannon has increased in the days following the unrest in Charlottesville. Former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci said earlier this week that “this sort of ‘Bannon-bart’ influence” on Trump “is a snag on the president.” Scaramucci’s comments came a day after Axios reported that Trump believes that Bannon has been leaking damaging information about his White House rivals, including national security adviser H.R. McMaster. The president added to the speculation by telling reporters on Tuesday that “we’ll see what happens with Mr. Bannon.”"

Sarah Palin's lawsuit needs to prove that the Times didn't just make mistakes.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5994be5714000020002c326c.jpeg?cache=jhsUwP0lKO&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"New York Times editorial page editor James Bennet testified Wednesday that he did not intend to draw a “direct causal link” between a map distributed by Sarah Palin’s political action committee and the 2011 shooting of then-Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.). Bennet said he was looking at the overall political climate and exploring the line between heated rhetoric and incitement in a June 14, 2017, editorial that referenced the Palin map. The editorial was written in response to the congressional baseball practice shooting that morning in which Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) and others were wounded.The editor’s testimony is part of a court hearing in Manhattan to determine if Palin’s lawsuit against the Times raises “sufficient allegations of actual malice” to proceed. In other words, can Palin even plausibly argue that the Times didn’t just make mistakes, but acted with malice toward her or with reckless disregard for the truth? U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff has said he intends to rule later this month on the Times’ motion to dismiss the suit. The June 14 editorial quickly drew criticism and prompted two corrections. The editorial stated incorrectly, as the Times acknowledged, that “the link to political incitement was clear” in the Giffords case. In fact, there is no evidence that the shooter, Jared Loughner, was targeting Giffords because of the map ― or that he had ever seen it.The editorial also wrongly asserted that the former congresswoman and 19 other Democrats were shown in the cross hairs on the Palin map. The Times corrected the piece to note that the cross hairs appeared over electoral districts, not specific politicians.On the witness stand, Bennet recalled drawing some inspiration for the editorial from colleague Thomas Friedman’s August 2016 column tying together then-candidate Donald Trump’s talk of a “Second Amendment” solution to Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton and the 1995 assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.The Friedman column is not mentioned in the June 14 editorial, titled “America’s Lethal Politics.” Bennet said Wednesday that the article was intended to hit three main points: “the horror” of the Scalise shooting, the paper’s position on “sensible gun control” and concerns about heated political rhetoric. Bennet, who returned to the Times last year as editorial page editor, said he asked Washington-based editorial writer Elizabeth Williamson, the original author of the piece, to revisit the paper’s stances around the 2011 Giffords shooting.Williamson filed a draft to Bennet around 5 p.m. by his account, and he significantly rewrote it before publication. Bennet said he didn’t discuss the edits with Williamson prior to publication because “deadlines were looming.”Much of Wednesday’s hearing centered on establishing what information Bennet had known while writing the editorial.Bennet said he had not read the 2011 editorials that a Times researcher sent to Williamson as she prepared the first draft of the piece or a 2011 ABC News article to which the online version of the Times editorial linked. Bennet also said he had not read a June 14 news article by Times reporter Alexander Burns that mentioned how “no connection” was ever established between the Palin map and the Giffords shooting.Bennet said he “didn’t know one way or another” at the time of publication whether there was an established link between the Palin map and the 2011 shooting. Palin attorney Ken Turkel also tried to establish whether Bennet had recalled specific coverage of the Giffords shooting when writing the June 14 editorial, presumably to determine whether the editor should have known any particular information to be false prior to publication.For instance, Turkel asked if Bennet recalled a 2011 dispute between commentator Andrew Sullivan ― whose “Daily Dish” blog was then published by The Atlantic ― and a Financial Times writer over linking Palin to the Giffords shooting. Bennet, who was The Atlantic’s top editor at the time, said he didn’t recall the matter when he was rewriting the Times editorial. He pointed out that Sullivan “had editorial control of The Daily Dish” and didn’t need to report such matters to him. Turkel also asked Bennet if he’d recalled, while reworking the editorial, that Palin had endorsed the GOP challenger to his brother, Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), in that year’s election. “If I had known that, I didn’t remember it,” the editor said, while adding that he wouldn’t have been surprised that Palin backed the Republican candidate.Judge Rakoff asked both sides to respond in writing to Wednesday’s hearing and said it was still to be determined if Williamson, who was unavailable this week, would need to testify in the pretrial proceeding.

Komen, The Washington Post reported Friday.Previously:Two major nonprofit organizations are pulling the plug on their plans to host upcoming events at President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club amid backlash over his controversial response to the deadly clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia.The Cleveland Clinic, a nonprofit medical center, announced its decision to cancel hosting its annual charity gala at the Palm Beach, Florida, resort in a statement on Thursday.“After careful consideration, Cleveland Clinic has decided that it will not hold a Florida fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago in 2018,” the statement said. “We thank the staff of Mar-a-Lago for their service over the years.”The annual event, which typically raises around $1 million and is attended by roughly 500 people, had been scheduled to take place on Feb. 24, 2018, and would have marked eight years in a row at the location.Proceeds from the fundraiser benefit Cleveland Clinic Florida, a hospital in Weston, according to Eileen Sheil, executive director of communications at Cleveland Clinic.Sheil told HuffPost there were “a variety of reasons” the clinic decided to drop Mar-a-Lago, but wouldn’t elaborate much further.“I think the community really was asking us to not have it there,” Sheil said, adding that the decision was made Thursday morning.The clinic is currently looking into other locations to host the gala.Hours after Cleveland Clinic announced their plans to scrap their planned event, the American Cancer Society followed suit.The nationwide health organization confirmed it is seeking a new venue to host its Island of Palm Beach gala on Feb. 22, 2018, in a statement to HuffPost. The organization has hosted the event at Mar-a-Lago since 2007.“When we chose to hold our 2018 event and related dinner at Mar-a-Lago, we selected the venue based on a variety of factors, including costs and venue requirements,” the statement said.“Our values and commitment to diversity are critical as we work to address the impact of cancer in every community,” the statement continued. “It has become increasingly clear that the challenge to those values is outweighing other business considerations.”The American Cancer Society and Cleveland Clinic are just the latest organizations to distance themselves from Trump following nearly a week of withering criticism over his response to a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville that left one dead and dozens injured.Trump initially blamed “many sides” for hatred and bigotry on Saturday, but eventually specifically condemned white supremacist groups after facing harsh criticism. But the president walked back some of his strong language on Tuesday by defending those who participated in the white nationalist rally and accusing counterprotesters ― whom he referred to as the “alt-left” ― of also acting violently.Toby Cosgrove, the chief executive of Cleveland Clinic was a member of the Strategic and Policy Forum, one of Trump’s two business advisory councils that disbanded this week in the wake of Trump’s explosive comments.On Monday, Kenneth Fraizer, CEO of Merck & Co., stepped down from Trump’s American Manufacturing Council. One by one, top business executives including, Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank and Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, followed in Fraizer’s footsteps. As members of Trump’s Strategic and Policy Forum began to resign from the group on Wednesday, Trump announced that he was “ending both” councils to alleviate “pressure” on its members.Laurel Baker, executive director of the Palm Beach Chamber of Commerce, told the Palm Beach Post that organizations should stop holding charity events at the Mar-a-Lago.“If you have a conscience, you’re really condoning bad behavior by continuing to be there,” Baker said. “Many say it’s the dollars (raised at the events) that count. Yes. But the integrity of any organization rests on their sound decisions and stewardship.”Trump Organization representatives did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s multiple requests for comment.

Komen, The Washington Post reported Friday.Previously:Two major nonprofit organizations are pulling the plug on their plans to host upcoming events at President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club amid backlash over his controversial response to the deadly clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia.The Cleveland Clinic, a nonprofit medical center, announced its decision to cancel hosting its annual charity gala at the Palm Beach, Florida, resort in a statement on Thursday.“After careful consideration, Cleveland Clinic has decided that it will not hold a Florida fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago in 2018,” the statement said. “We thank the staff of Mar-a-Lago for their service over the years.”The annual event, which typically raises around $1 million and is attended by roughly 500 people, had been scheduled to take place on Feb. 24, 2018, and would have marked eight years in a row at the location.Proceeds from the fundraiser benefit Cleveland Clinic Florida, a hospital in Weston, according to Eileen Sheil, executive director of communications at Cleveland Clinic.Sheil told HuffPost there were “a variety of reasons” the clinic decided to drop Mar-a-Lago, but wouldn’t elaborate much further.“I think the community really was asking us to not have it there,” Sheil said, adding that the decision was made Thursday morning.The clinic is currently looking into other locations to host the gala.Hours after Cleveland Clinic announced their plans to scrap their planned event, the American Cancer Society followed suit.The nationwide health organization confirmed it is seeking a new venue to host its Island of Palm Beach gala on Feb. 22, 2018, in a statement to HuffPost. The organization has hosted the event at Mar-a-Lago since 2007.“When we chose to hold our 2018 event and related dinner at Mar-a-Lago, we selected the venue based on a variety of factors, including costs and venue requirements,” the statement said.“Our values and commitment to diversity are critical as we work to address the impact of cancer in every community,” the statement continued. “It has become increasingly clear that the challenge to those values is outweighing other business considerations.”The American Cancer Society and Cleveland Clinic are just the latest organizations to distance themselves from Trump following nearly a week of withering criticism over his response to a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville that left one dead and dozens injured.Trump initially blamed “many sides” for hatred and bigotry on Saturday, but eventually specifically condemned white supremacist groups after facing harsh criticism. But the president walked back some of his strong language on Tuesday by defending those who participated in the white nationalist rally and accusing counterprotesters ― whom he referred to as the “alt-left” ― of also acting violently.Toby Cosgrove, the chief executive of Cleveland Clinic was a member of the Strategic and Policy Forum, one of Trump’s two business advisory councils that disbanded this week in the wake of Trump’s explosive comments.On Monday, Kenneth Fraizer, CEO of Merck & Co., stepped down from Trump’s American Manufacturing Council. One by one, top business executives including, Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank and Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, followed in Fraizer’s footsteps. As members of Trump’s Strategic and Policy Forum began to resign from the group on Wednesday, Trump announced that he was “ending both” councils to alleviate “pressure” on its members.Laurel Baker, executive director of the Palm Beach Chamber of Commerce, told the Palm Beach Post that organizations should stop holding charity events at the Mar-a-Lago.“If you have a conscience, you’re really condoning bad behavior by continuing to be there,” Baker said. “Many say it’s the dollars (raised at the events) that count. Yes. But the integrity of any organization rests on their sound decisions and stewardship.”Trump Organization representatives did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s multiple requests for comment. A receptionist for Mar-a-Lago said she was told to direct phone calls to the White House. A White House spokeswoman declined to comment on the canceled events."

She was born in Bulgaria and raised in Canada before moving to Los Angeles. “Hopefully he’ll get impeached. Or indicted. Or both. He just doesn’t act like a president. He acts like a reality star on a terrible, horrible show that should never be aired,” she continued. “And he’s responsible for incredibly important decisions for the country that I live in, so my opinion does matter whether or not I had a chance to vote.”Dobrev was a vocal supporter of Hillary Clinton throughout the 2016 presidential campaign, often through social media. And she hasn’t shied away from openly opposing Trump since his election. However, not all of her followers share the same views, which has led Dobrev to read “some of the most horrific things I’ve ever seen written” in the comments section on her posts.She pays no mind, though.“I’m entitled to my opinion, and if you don’t want to see the things I’m saying, don’t follow me,” she told the magazine.

Robert E. Lee calls for the park to be renamed for Heather Heyer, who was killed at in a far-right rally, in Charlottesville, Virginia, U.S., Aug. 16, 2017.

This number is slightly down from recent years. In 2015, a HuffPost analysis found that this number was at least 195. This original analysis was conducted in the wake of a racist shooting at a historically black church in Charleston, South Carolina, which left nine people dead. Clearly, since that time, not much has changed.This list captures the most recent available data from the National Center for Education Statistics. We limited our search to that of well-known Confederate leaders, and we only included a school on our list if we could conclusively determine for who it was named. We also counted schools that were named for towns, counties or other locations that were named for Confederate leaders. The debate over public spaces named for leaders who fought to uphold slavery has been a hot-button one for years. Controversy over this issue was reignited this past week when thousands of white supremacists and armed militia groups rallied in Charlottesville, Virginia. In recent months, Charlottesville has drawn protests from white nationalist leaders after the city council voted to remove a prominent statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.“This entire community is a very far left community that has absorbed these cultural Marxist principles advocated in college towns across the country, about blaming white people for everything,” Jason Kessler, one of the white nationalist leaders, told CNN.In recent years, a number of schools honoring Confederate leaders have opted to change their names amid backlash from community members. These schools serve a diverse range of students, HuffPost found. A disproportionate number of students of color attend schools named for Confederate leaders. President Donald Trump, on the other hand, has continued to defend the existence of these monuments, even after the rallies in Charlottesville resulted in the death of 32-year-old Heather Heyer. Heyer, an anti-racist protester, died after an alleged alt-right demonstrator plowed into a group of counterprotesters with his car. “Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,” Trump tweeted Thursday.Below is a map of where these schools are located. While they’re predominantly concentrated in the southeast region of the United States, they are also scattered throughout northern and western regions. "

Increases in extreme precipitation are projected for all U.S. regions.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/599601f222000046001a68ac.png?ops=crop_211_71_1352_1129%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump continued his crusade earlier this week to undo everything that President Obama accomplished. This time, he issued an executive order that wipes out one of the most progressive standards of our time for reducing the taxpayer costs and risks that weather disasters pose for new roads, bridges, railroads, electric transmission lines and other infrastructure.The order is part of Trump’s attempt to speed up the permitting and environmental reviews for infrastructure projects. The title says it will bring “discipline and accountability” to environmental impact studies. Insofar as the order accomplishes those objectives while still protecting the environment, property, human life and taxpayer investments, it’s all to the good.But in what looks like an afterthought, Trump revoked an executive order Obama issued in 2015 to make sure the federal government doesn’t locate these projects in places where they might be damaged or destroyed by floods, only to be rebuilt with taxpayer money.What may have caught Trump’s eye is Obama’s explanation of how to define a floodplain – the land area likely to be inundated. One option was to use a “climate-informed science approach” to anticipate where flooding will occur in the future as global warming causes more intense rainfalls. That’s necessary because most infrastructure lasts a long time while extreme rainfalls and floods are getting more common. They are projected to become much worse as time goes on.It’s likely that three words in Obama’s sensible policy also doomed it: “Obama,” “climate” and “science.” Trump and his team have made it clear they don’t like those words.It would be one thing if the projections of more intense rainfalls and damaging floods were long shots or mere speculation. But the deluges happening today are precisely what climate scientists predicted. The largest number of U.S. floods on record took place last year. A year ago, 13 people were killed, 60,000 buildings were destroyed and $10 billion in damages occurred in Louisiana because of a flood that statistics predicted would very rarely happen. Elsewhere in the state, there were eight other supposedly rare flood disasters in about a year.Floods, the most common extreme weather events in the United States, were among 91 natural disasters here in 2016, the second highest number on record. Kevin Trenberth of the National Center for Atmospheric Research notes, “There have been many so-called 500-year floods along the Mississippi River every five to 10 years since 1993.”The most recent National Climate Assessment concludes that, “Heavy downpours are increasing nationally, especially over the last three to five decades, with the largest increase in the Midwest and Northeast. Increases in extreme precipitation are projected for all U.S. regions.” Mark Bove, a meteorologist at the global reinsurance company Munich Re, says severe flash floods have increased in heavily developed areas of the country.According to Peter Hoppe, who heads Munich Re’s Geo Risks Research Unit, “there are now many indications that certain events – such as persistent weather systems or storms bringing torrential rain and hail – are more likely to occur in certain regions as a result of climate change.”Fortunately, states are allowed to set standards that are tougher than those established by the federal government. That’s what states with increasingly severe flooding should do. A good model is the Obama executive order that Trump just revoked."

The rowdy rocker then explained why any rumors to the contrary are ridiculous and dangerous to the Michigan Republican Party.“OK? He never intended ― he never thought about it ― and he never hinted that he’s running for anything, so the Michigan GOP better get their head out of their butt and start using their resources to focus on someone,” the conservative Republican said. “I don’t know who I will endorse at this time, but we have got to send [current senator] Debbie Stabenow packing to the Barbara Boxer, Nancy Pelosi, you know, antifa world.”Beckmann pointed out that Nugent’s statement constituted a scoop for the show, but the guitarist wasn’t having any of it, despite Kid Rock’s July 12 tweet:“He ain’t running!” Nugent said. “He never thought of running. Somebody literally pulled it out of their ass and said, ‘Hey, what about Kid Rock?’ Kid Rock didn’t know anything about it. He’s just having fun with it because it’s so silly.”Although Kid Rock is selling “Kid Rock for Senate” hats and T-shirts at KidRockForSenate.com, Nugent said that doesn’t mean the singer has serious political ambitions.“Yeah, well, what the hell does that have to do with running for public office?” he told Beckmann.The Canada Free Press notes there is actually a legitimate connection:“FEC filings are due 15 days from the date that you raise your first five thousand dollars. If Kid Rock sold five grand worth of shirts and hats ― which is likely at $25 apiece ― that date passed a couple of weeks ago.” Nugent told Beckmann that the GOP is wasting energy on Rock that could be used for promoting a more legit candidate.It isn’t the first time that Nugent has pooh-poohed the idea of a Kid Rock Senate campaign. On Aug. 9, Nugent told Newsmax TV that Kid Rock wasn’t seriously considering a run for office but admitted he thought Rock wouldn’t do a bad job if he were elected.“And, quite honestly, I know Bob, I know Kid Rock — he would make a much-improved representative in Michigan for ‘We the people,’” he said in the segment. “Logic, truth, common sense, that good will and decency and that work ethic that makes America work. But that the GOP and the media continue to milk this nonsense is one of the most embarrassing chapters for the Republican Party.”You can see the complete segment in the video below."

Harris, editor of Augusta Courier, 1951, quoted by the Southern Poverty Law CenterIt is not surprising that Donald Trump equates the removal of statues with ripping apart the “culture of our great country.” He seems incapable of understanding that his rhetoric encourages the worst part of his base to tear open a cultural wound that has not fully healed now for 156 years.There are 1,500 Civil War memorials in the United States ― “beautiful statues and monuments” as Trump calls them. He’s sad about the “beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks.”What’s going on in America right now, however, is not designed to deprive cities of handsome statuary. It is not meant to erase history, either. What happened happened. I think the motive of the people who want to remove monuments to the Civil War is to end the aggrandizement of fighting to preserve bigotry. We do not need any more young people to think it is heroic to start a race war by shooting and killing black Americans in their churches. Nor do we need the separatists who say they are not racists although they would prefer a nation of black states and white states instead of red states and blue states.There is an important distinction to be made between remembering history and trying to revive it. There also is a distinction between famous warriors and famous patriots. We can think of Robert E. Lee as a brilliant general, for example, but that is not the same as being a great patriot in a land founded on the principle that “all men are created equal.”But sadly, there still are the Americans who prefer to carry Confederate or Nazi flags rather than the Stars and Stripes. Those who say the Confederate flag is about “heritage not hate” miss the obvious point: They are proving that the heritage of the Confederacy is hate.In his latest tweets, Trump repeats his argument that if the monuments of Confederate generals come down, perhaps the monuments to Jefferson and Washington should come down, too, since both presidents owned slaves. The best answer came from a light-night comedian who noted that however flawed Washington and Jefferson might have been, they built the country while the heroes of the Confederacy tried to tear it apart.We cannot expect Donald Trump to heal the wound of racism or to purge our country of nationalists, separatists, and racists that still divide us. None of the presidents who served since the Civil War have been able to do that – not Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Johnson, Ulysses Grant, Rutherford Hayes, James Garfield, Chester Arthur, Grover Cleveland, Benjamin Harrison, William McKinley, Teddy Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, Woodrow Wilson, Warren Harding, Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover, Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush or even Barack Obama.However, a president can and should express the moral standard required to be true to the Founder’s vision for America. Then if the wound is ever to be healed, it will be have to be done by people. Unfortunately, what we see right now are people so cemented in their racial biases that they are eager to defend them with violence, not unlike the violence we saw in the past they want to revive."

Tokyo, Japan. Aug. 10, 2017. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59949b4814000020002c31e8.jpeg?cache=bRppgeqP3i&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"TOKYO ― East Asia is facing a crisis of military conflict it has not seen for many decades. Though North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has taken a step back this week from his initial threat to fire intermediate-range missiles near Guam, that threat exposed the vulnerabilities of countries in the region ― especially Japan ― over which those missiles would fly and which North Korea could easily target directly.U.S. President Donald Trump and some members of his administration have made clear that the United States would regard the threat to Guam as a threat against America, perhaps even if the area where North Korean ballistic missiles drop is open water. As such, American officials, including U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis, have implied they are prepared to intercept missiles launched in Guam’s direction from North Korea ― an act Pyongyang has more or less suggested it would consider an invasion.Such detailed exchanges about war fighting ― “if you do this, we’ll do that” ― have rattled the region, particularly those of us in Japan. But Japan has options.The U.S. military stationed in East Asia has the central mission of protecting its Japanese and South Korean allies. Part and parcel of that protective shield are three pillars of its nuclear forces ― the intercontinental ballistics missiles, or ICBMs, based in the U.S., the submarine-launched ballistic missiles roaming the seas, or SLBMs, and the strategic bomber force. The Andersen Air Force Base in Guam is home to B-1, B-2 and B-52 strategic bombers that form that airborne wing of the American protective umbrella for its Asian allies. For the North Koreans, the aim of shooting a ballistic missile targeting the Andersen Air Force Base is to demonstrate that they have the capacity to damage or destroy one key pillar of U.S. nuclear forces in Asia.Because Japan does not have its own nuclear weapons and relies on the U.S. shield to deter attacks from nuclear countries, any attack on Guam must be considered a threat to Japanese security. For that reason, Japan needs to think about developing its own capacity to deter attacks on Guam as well as on its own territory.What can Japan do? One policy alternative is to develop the capacity to attack enemy bases in North Korea with conventional weapons ― both as a deterrent and preemptively if a threat is imminent. A nuclear option for Japan is out of the question because of the very high costs, politically as well as economically.Specifically, Japan should accelerate the introduction of air-to-surface missiles and add the number of air tankers to fuel fighter flights en route. Japan should also consider developing a cruise missile that flies 2,000 kilometers as well as ballistic missiles with a longer range. Japan may further consider possessing aircraft carriers. Finally, it should deploy early warning satellites that are not dependent only on the United States.In short, Japan should learn from South Korea, which is already developing ballistic missiles and has cruise missiles. Beyond building the proactive defense capabilities I have mentioned, it is also important to rapidly engage in a Japan-North Korea security dialogue in order to make it crystal clear that Japan has no intention of joining any ground battle on the Korean Peninsula. Finally, a lack of communication on the Korean Peninsula between Japan and North Korea, the U.S. and North Korea, and North and South Korea is what has enabled tensions to reach a fever pitch. These are the lessons of August in East Asia.This piece was translated from Japanese and edited for clarity."

All we can say is that we don’t have any control of the situation. As much as possible, we don’t want this bloody encounter.”Thousands of people have been killed in the anti-drugs campaign, Duterte’s signature policy, since it was launched on June 30 last year, most users and small-time dealers from poor neighborhoods.The intensity of the crackdown has alarmed the international community, and activists and human rights groups say police have been executing suspects and planting drugs and guns at crime scenes. Police and the government officials reject that.Police also deny involvement in thousands of murders by mysterious gunmen, blaming them on gang turf wars, drug dealers silencing informants, or vigilantes targeting drug users.“There were 32 killed in Bulacan in a massive raid, that’s good,” Duterte said in a speech. “Let’s kill another 32 every day. Maybe we can reduce what ails this country.”Police conducted 49 sting drug operations in Bulacan that resulted in about 20 armed encounters, Caramat said. Ten other gunfights ensued when police tried to serve arrest warrants to suspects who fought back.He said 93 of those held were wanted for other crimes, as well as drugs offenses.Bulacan has been a major target in the drugs war, with some 425 people killed and 4,000 offenders arrested, according to Caramat, making it the second-biggest hot spot in the crackdown outside of the Manila area.Political opponents of Duterte have filed a complaint with the International Criminal Court (ICC) accusing the president and top aides of crimes against humanity, arguing they failed to address allegations of widespread police abuses that have been brought to their attention.Duterte has welcomed the ICC complaint and said he was willing to rot in jail to protect Filipinos.He has often complained about human rights groups criticizing and undermining his campaign and on Wednesday said he would instead investigate them, or worse.“If they are obstructing justice, shoot them,” he said."

I’m a Jew, I’m an Israeli, the neo nazis scums in Virginia hate me and my country. But they belong to the past. Their breed is dying out,” the 26-year-old Netanyahu said.“However the thugs of Antifa and BLM who hate my country (and America too in my view) just as much are getting stronger and stronger and becoming super dominant in American universities and public life,” he said.The Black Lives Matter movement has previously levied harsh criticism against Israel for its policies toward Palestinians, connected with Palestinian activists and supported the Boycott, Divest and Sanction movement that seeks punitive measures against the state for its actions. Many leftist movements have long criticized the human rights situation in Israel.Yair Netanyahu’s framing of the Charlottesville rally echoed U.S. President Donald Trump’s widely criticized remarks on Tuesday at Trump Tower, where the president doubled down on his initial statement blaming “both sides” following Saturday’s white supremacist demonstrations. The event saw clashes between far-right extremist groups and Antifa counterprotesters. In one incident during the day, a car driven by an alleged neo-Nazi rammed into a crowd in Charlottesville, killing anti-racist protester Heather Heyer. Trump’s subdued condemnations of white supremacists and claims that there were “very fine people on both sides” of the Charlottesville rallies have been the subject of derision from both national parities and several prominent international politicians, including Vice Chancellor of Germany Sigmar Gabriel who said he was “shocked” Trump did not condemn the far-right extremists involved.Prime Minister Netanyahu also issued a condemnation Tuesday of the anti-Semitism displayed at the Charlottesville rally and the neo-Nazi presence, stating on his official Twitter account that he was “outraged by expressions of anti-Semitism, neo-Nazism and racism.” But unlike several other world leaders and politicians, Netanyahu waited days before issuing a statement on the events and received some criticism over his silence. Yair, the eldest son of the prime minister, has become increasingly prevalent in Israeli media this year after being implicated in a number of scandals.Authorities have questioned Yair, along with his mother Sara Netanyahu, as part of an intensifying corruption probe surrounding the family. Last week, left-wing think tank Molad launched a libel lawsuit against Yair following a disparaging Facebook post he made about the group after it wrote an article criticizing his lavish lifestyle. Yair was also the subject of a bizarre incident several weeks ago, during which one of the Netanyahu’s neighbors accused him of failing to pick up family dog Kaya’s feces during a walk. When the neighbor confronted Yair, she said that he gave her a middle finger gesture and then walked away. The neighbor’s Facebook post about the alleged incident was shared thousands of times by Israeli social media users."

On one side are those saying that white supremacist rhetoric represents an incitement to violence and should be illegal. While I am not a legal scholar, it seems clear to me that groups like we saw in Charlottesville have a constitutionally protected right to spew whatever political rhetoric they want in a public setting. It doesn’t become incitement until actual calls to commit criminal acts are made. The other side, championed by groups like the ACLU (and the white supremacists themselves), argues that hate speech and hate rallies are legally permissible and should be defended against any and all who would say otherwise. This side is just as wrong. Just because a legal right exists doesn’t necessarily mean it should, and the hatred espoused by white supremacists should neither be permitted nor defended.On a Monday, we might hear someone say that sticks and stones may break our bones, but words will never hurt us. Then, come Tuesday, we might hear someone else say that the pen is mightier than the sword. Obviously, both of these sayings cannot be true. When someone makes the claim that words cannot hurt them, they disregard centuries of precedent that proves otherwise. Attempting to disassociate the pogroms of the 19th century, the Holocaust, the Armenian Genocide, Jim Crow era lynchings, the persecution of minorities by ISIS, and all the other hate-driven acts of recent history with the words that preceded them is both foolish and dangerous. Nazi Germany didn’t just sprout up out of the ground as the crazed “blood and soil” chanters seem to imagine. Instead, it came to be as a result of years of uncontrolled antisemitism and the circulation of race-based conspiracy theories throughout German society. Words can be used for incredibly positive ends, but all too often they are used to inflict pain on others.Allowing the modern generation of hate-mongers to spread their rhetoric in the public square, online, and over the airwaves will inevitably produce violence, as it already has in Charlottesville. So, one has to wonder, why are groups like the ACLU missing the forest for the trees by enabling this vile speech? The answer is simple: Currently, there is a bizarre taboo over amending, or calling for the amendment of, the Constitution in any way, shape, or form. For some reason, we continue to believe that 18th century men knew what types of rights would be well suited for those of us living in the 21st century. Until elected leaders and the groups we’ve empowered to protect our rights break with this 18th century worldview, the rights of hate peddlers to say what they want will continue to be used to chip away at the collective rights of everyone else.It’s often argued that taking away certain speech rights is a ‘slippery slope’ that will eventually result in the loss of all rights to engage in free expression. Unsurprisingly, no data or evidence is ever provided to reinforce this fallacy. Somehow, robust democracies that have placed limitations on free speech, such as the United Kingdom, Germany, and France, have managed to continue their traditions of public policy debate. This is because placing limits on harmful speech does not lead to any sort of limitation of socially beneficial speech. If it is true that the American political system is so fragile that banning Neo-Nazi rallies will lead to the inability to give policy input or speak freely about an elected leader, then our society is broken in more ways than we’d like to acknowledge. I don’t believe we’re that far gone just yet.It is important to consider that the freedom of speech isn’t an inherent good. Like all other freedoms, it can only be considered good if it produces positive social outcomes. Unfortunately, right now it isn’t. Misinformation, fear, and hatred is at an all-time high due to near-absolute freedom to spread whatever conspiracy, lie, or deception through our means of mass communication. If we truly want to see a better tomorrow, it is time that Americans take the difficult step of analyzing just how free we want our free speech rights to be."

There’s no denying it anymore.Donald Trump once again cemented himself on the wrong side of history, pleading Tuesday not to remove statues honoring the Confederacy. He argued that some of those who marched alongside neo-Nazis in the deadly Charlottesville protest were “fine people.”Trump is legitimizing hate and guaranteeing that when more statues come down, protests will swell. He is making white supremacy socially acceptable in a way that we haven’t seen in generations. He’s empowering racists to come out of the closet and show their face. The president has our back!Trump is using the old segregationist tactic, saying the other side is bad, too. He’s painfully wrong in a way that’s setting us back decades.Violence on any side is never the answer but it’s dangerous to argue these white supremacy groups are one in the same with Black Lives Matters and Antifa, which stands for Anti-Fascists.Black Lives Matters and Antifa are preaching against systematic racism and discrimination.They hurt their own message when they resort to violence but at their core they’re fighting for an equal society.As president, Trump is supposed to strive for a United States where all men — and women — are created equal. The Confederate States of America, a long-ago failed separatist movement, fought against these values. They lost the fight and half a million people died in their quest to protect slavery. Yet Trump has inexplicability taken the side of preserving this dark blemish in history because those who want to return to the darkness are those who also support Trump.Trump has always been about Trump. But now he’s the president and he’s taking down the country’s moral fiber all for adoration from his dwindling base.Trump took a page right out of the David Duke book of logic, saying on Tuesday that “George Washington was a slave owner. So will George Washington lose his status? Are we going to take down statues to George Washington? How about Thomas Jefferson?”Both Washington and Jefferson condemned slavery later in the lives and hoped for its eventual demise. Confederate leaders took the opposite approach — they pushed to extend slavery into new territories and preserve it.There’s a reason David Duke praised Trump on Tuesday, writing “Thank You Mr. President & God Bless you for setting the record straight for ALL AMERICANS.”White Supremacists no longer feel like they have to live in the shadows. Many will argue “I’m one of those fine people the president was talking about.”Trump is an enabler and we should fear what comes next."

What Trump failed to mention in his latest commercial for Making America Great Again is how all of this suggested growth was made possible without acknowledging the progress carved out in the previous administration.He did not tweet that our country could be crippled if programs like Medicaid are cut along with the proposed $191 million deficit to the government’s SNAP Program—otherwise known as the food stamp program. A multi-tiered action that would undoubtedly devastate the more than one in five Americans that rely on the government’s healthcare plan, leaving them with less or no medical coverage, more jobs to compete for, not enough money to feed their families and reduce their chances of completing or furthering their education. Medicaid and similar programs service our elderly, disabled, lower income individuals and their families, and our veterans—all people that are most in need and who are least likely to bounce back from such a blow.Trump has stated that any able-bodied person receiving SNAP benefits should be working, an uninformed belief he and the GOP share that confirms his lack of knowledge and empathy for those receiving these benefits. Homes that receive SNAP benefits have at least one parent working, and they must continue being employed to keep their benefits. Most individuals participating in this anti-hunger program are doing just that, actively participating, not sitting back horading benefits.People who receive SNAP are hard-working. The average SNAP participant works a low-income job that is sporadic and unpredictable in scheduling with no potential for healthcare considerations. These families usually have one or more children increasing the need for nutritional food in addition to costly childcare. Unlike children from middle class to upper-class homes whose parents are better able to afford quality care for their children. Low-income individuals spend almost one-third of their earnings on childcare so that they can work with another 30 percent going toward housing. Without the aid of what is equivalent to approximately $1 per person, per meal, these children and families would not be able to afford food.Childcare, education and food are the highest cost considerations next to housing for families. Food costs are approximately 18 percent of the total cost to raise a child, and that’s for couple with a dual income. To educate and care for dependent children makes up another 16 percent.The GOP would have you believe that SNAP participants are freeloaders and the worst of our society. What they fail to realize is that no one dreams of growing up to need food stamps to feed their family. But it happens sometimes and when it does what isn’t needed is condemnation and judgment.Many of us have been there, standing in line with someone paying by EBT—the government debit card used to pay for approved food items, only to notice that there’s a problem with how the card is being accepted or more often the way cashiers handle these types of transactions lacking empathy and patience. But why this stigma? Where did it come from? What’s the difference between the mom who is discreetly told that her credit card didn’t go through and asked if she has another? There is no difference in these two situations, both individuals are trying to feed their families. Why do we make people struggling to get by feel that they are standing out when they are simply trying to remain standing?Here’s what the program actually does:Increases food purchasing power for healthier choices – families can supplement their food purchases with SNAP, increasing access to healthy food choices at more than 240,000 retailers across the country… including farmers’ markets where SNAP participants can select from a variety of fresh and nutritious foods while increasing the customer base for local farmers.Provides nutrition education – individuals and families can receive nutrition education to improve the likelihood that they will make healthy food choices within a limited budget based on the MyPlate and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Information about nutrition can be found at http://snap.nal.usda.gov/resource-library/click-n-go-education-materials.Offers employment and training services – SNAP households are eligible for employment and training services, including assistance with seeking and retaining employment or attending secondary education courses to start a new vocation/career.With childcare costing an average of 30 percent of your salary, there’s no wonder why some single parent families rely on SNAP benefits and government subsidies. SNAP is an essential program and should not be cut.SNAP is an investment in our future. It offers nutrition benefits to participating clients, supports work, and provides economic benefits to communities. So since the GOP likes to boast about all the economic growth our country has seen over the past few months perhaps they need to also consider how some of that growth was sustained.Sharisse Tracey is a writing fellow for the Center for Community Change."

Matt Bevin (R) is opposed to relocating Confederate statues. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/599474bd22000009371a6481.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin (R), like President Donald Trump, has said that both white supremacists and counterprotesters are to blame for the deadly violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend.The violence erupted as white nationalist and neo-Nazi groups descended on Charlottesville, ostensibly to protest a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee being removed from a public park in the city. Tiki torch-wielding white nationalists surrounded protesters with anti-Nazi and anti-Ku Klux Klan signs who had gathered near the statue on Friday night, while others affiliated with white nationalist groups were caught on film using flagpoles to beat Deandre Harris, a 20-year-old African-American man. A Kentucky man with ties to white nationalist groups drove his car into a crowd of counterprotesters on Saturday, killing one woman and injuring least 19 people. Bevin responded by criticizing the white nationalist and neo-Nazi groups, but also said “all sides” were to blame for the violence.“The kind of racial hatred that we’re seeing from people, as has been said by the president, on all sides ― people are offended at the idea that people take exception with a particular type of hatred versus another,” Bevin said Tuesday in an interview with West Virginia radio station WVHU. “All of it is reprehensible. It just is. There’s no reason for it, there’s no room for it. It doesn’t further anything. And the fact that it has been allowed to accelerate out of control, as it has, is is irresponsible on the part of people who allowed it to happen.”“The fact that people were allowed to clash with one another as they were in Virginia, that people were encouraged to come in and counterprotest and be just as violent and angry as the hateful people that came in in the first place ― people knew what was gonna happen, and it’s unfortunate,” Bevin said. “And the result of that is that innocent lives were lost. And I find the whole thing disgusting.”In his initial remarks on Charlottesville, Trump said “many sides” were to blame for the violence. His comments were widely criticized and condemned ― by Republicans and Democrats alike ― for enabling the white supremacist groups that had chanted racist, anti-Semitic and anti-LGBT slogans during their rallies. Trump reiterated those comments in an unnerving press conference on Tuesday afternoon, saying that “both sides” shared blame. “You had a group on one side that was bad, and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent,” Trump said. “There were very fine people on both sides.”Leaders of some white nationalist groups have viewed Trump’s comments as an accurate description of the events in Charlottesville, while others have described his previous tepid rebuke of them as “Kumbaya nonsense” that he doesn’t believe. Bevin’s decision to lay some blame at the feet of people protesting white supremacists comes at a tenuous time for his state. White nationalist leaders told the Lexington Herald-Leader on Tuesday that that they were planning rallies in the city to protest Mayor Jim Gray’s efforts to remove two Confederate statues from outside a historic downtown courthouse.The monuments stand on land that was once home to one of the South’s largest slave auction sites. They depict Confederate secretary of war and former U.S. Vice President John C. Breckinridge and Confederate Gen. John Hunt Morgan; Jake Gibbs, the Lexington city councilman who represents the area, said the monuments were erected during and after Reconstruction as a way to show that “white supremacy was back.”There is no set date for the rallies, and a Lexington Police Department spokesperson told HuffPost that police are monitoring the situation but have not heard of specific plans for demonstrations. Lexington currently doesn’t plan to destroy statues. Rather, it intends to find a another location for them, which Gray and other lawmakers have said will allow them to exist in the proper context of Kentucky’s Civil War history.“I think moving the statues and providing info about them ― why they were placed there, what their meaning is, providing more information about Reconstruction and how it was handled in Kentucky ― would be useful,” Lexington vice mayor and city council member Steve Kay told HuffPost this week. “And the people who have a legit interest in maintaining that history will find that acceptable.”Bevin also criticized the nationwide efforts to move Confederate statues, saying he is opposed to the “sanitization of history.” Kentucky, where slavery was legal, has more monuments to the Confederacy than any other state that did not leave the Union, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.“I absolutely disagree with this sanitization of history. If we want to learn from history, if we don’t want to repeat the mistakes of our past, then we better teach it to our young people,” Bevin said in the radio interview. “It better be known. It doesn’t have to be celebrated, as in, ‘This is something we did and should do again.’ But to pretend it didn’t happen, to remove from society, because where do you draw the line?”In 2015, however, Bevin said he thought it would be “appropriate” to remove the statue of Confederate President Jefferson Davis that stands in the rotunda of the Kentucky state Capitol in Frankfort. The Kentucky NAACP and some state residents have called on lawmakers to remove the statue.Last year, Louisville relocated a Confederate monument that had been on the the University of Louisville’s campus. Mayor Greg Fischer has called for a review of any Confederate memorials remaining in the city.Bevin, in the radio interview, was also critical of Charlottesville law enforcement officials, who have been scrutinized for how they handled the weekend’s demonstrations. Bevin pointed to a white supremacist rally that took place in Kentucky earlier this year to say that his state would be prepared to ward off any violent outbreaks if white nationalist groups demonstrated in Lexington.“I can’t speak for what the city of Lexington will do” if the rallies occur, he said. “But I will speak for the state of Kentucky. As happened when people met in our state parks to try to do the exact same thing a few months ago, as I said, such activity will be discouraged to the degree possible, as in, we don’t want that nastiness and foolishness in our state. But because this is a free society and there’s only so much that can be shut down in advance, then such activity if it moves forward will be met with an overwhelming amount of preparation. And it will not be allowed to accelerate to that degree.”America does not do a good job of tracking incidents of hate and bias. We need your help to create a database of such incidents across the country, so we all know what’s going on. Tell us your story."

The only difference in this conversation is that now neo-Nazis, KKK members, and white supremacists are no longer hiding behind white cloth in the woods burning crosses. While still cowards, they are now open about their identities and purpose which has been fueled by hateful rhetoric and lack of conviction in condemnation of Donald Trump. In an attempt to bridge the racial divide and heal the wound inflicted by a race war that has been waging on for decades, the president of the United States has instead instigated an already unstable America.Why is this a problem?The outcry expressed by Americans on both sides of the aisle was almost loud enough to provide a distraction from the fact that Donald Trump is treating the North Korea conflict as a real life version of Battleship. While so many came together over this divisiveness, Trump waited 48 hours to make an official statement that condemns those groups by name. In fact, in his initial statement, Trump basically vindicates those groups stating “We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides.”By not calling out their names, that statement had no weight. It was a blanket statement expressing what all decent people already knew to be true. It also gave those groups the idea that Trump was supporting them. Andrew Anglin, creator of the Nazi site ‘The Daily Stormer’ states “he didn’t attack us,” he wrote in a blog post on the site. ”(He) implied that there was hate ... on both sides. So he implied the antifa are haters. There was virtually no counter-signaling of us all.” After Trump finally decided to break his silence on the matter, he proceeds with a hollow and rehearsed statement that came across as too little, too late.Not only did it come across as insincere because of the silence before the speech, he also begins his statement talking about jobs, infrastructure, and economy. Keep in mind he appeared with two Jewish men and an Asian woman. He clearly prioritizes money over human lives. The father of a Jewish daughter and son-in-law, won’t even take the time to immediately disavow the behavior and relation with the groups that were represented at the protests that eventually took the lives of three human beings. To add insult to injury, Donald Trump outwardly defends the alt-right in an off-the-cuff press conference on Tuesday, showing his true personality.For those that oppose Donald Trump, this is who they knew him to be all along. If anything, this was him symbolically coming out of his own woods while taking off his hood. Trump, if not a white supremacist himself, appeared to be a white supremacist sympathizer. His history has shown this to be possibly true, when considering his Muslim ban and the wall meant to keep out undocumented Latino immigrants, and litany of other racist accusations in his time in the private sector.Additionally, it is extremely reckless for Donald Trump to rewrite history to serve his own agenda, and the agenda of those that put him in office. It is very public knowledge that uneducated white Americans are the ones that placed Donald Trump in the White House. In fact, roughly 51% percent of uneducated white Americans voted for Trump. It should be no surprise that portions of that same population also rallied for white supremacy in Charlottesville. While that information is readily available, in combination with what recent history has told us about the groups that rallied, people are still in disbelief that this can happen in America. The fact is, we are faced with a very real threat of racism in this country. The president is, however recklessly, addressing foreign threats but is ignoring the threat of domestic terrorism which is a possibility every day."

So, on Tuesday night, the mayor directed city workers to build a temporary structure around a Confederate statue in downtown Linn Park.Less than 24 hours later, Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall filed a lawsuit against Birmingham and the mayor, saying the deliberate obstruction of the Confederate Soldiers and Sailors Monument is illegal.“In accordance with the law, my office has determined that by affixing tarps and placing plywood around the Linn Park Memorial such that it is hidden from view, the Defendants have ‘altered’ or ‘otherwise disturbed’ the memorial in violation of the letter and spirit of the Alabama Memorial Preservation Act,” Marshall’s office said in a statement. “The City of Birmingham does not have the right to violate the law and leaves my office with no choice but to file suit.”The mayor’s office didn’t immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. In a statement to Birmingham CBS-affiliate WIAT, Bell said he wasn’t backing down.″We look forward to the court system clarifying the rights and power of a municipality to control its parks absent state intervention,” the mayor said.The city told WBRC it wants to hide the monument from public view while it considers legal options to remove it entirely.The Birmingham controversy follows white supremacist violence that upended Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend, killing a counter-protester and injuring at least 19. Racist groups descended on Charlottesville to protest the city’s removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.More than 700 Confederate monuments inhabit public spaces across 31 states, according to USA Today. The monuments increasingly are viewed more as racist symbols than as historical memorials, as their advocates claim. In response to the Charlottesville violence, numerous cities with Confederate monuments are removing them. None acted as swiftly as Baltimore, which quietly removed all four of its statues Tuesday night.Birmingham was a front line in the civil rights movement in the 1960s, when protesters led by Martin Luther King Jr. demanded an end to public segregation and were met with police and KKK violence. The uproar that followed a 1963 church bombing that killed four black girls is credited with spurring passage of the Civil Rights Act a year later.America does not do a good job of tracking incidents of hate and bias.

Responders were still searching for the missing crewmen as of 12:30 p.m. Wednesday, a spokesperson for the Coast Guard told HuffPost, adding that efforts were still search-and-rescue and not recovery.Two of the missing crewmen are pilots and three are crew members.The helicopter was one of two Black Hawks that were on a night training mission off the coast between Kaena Point and the Dillingham Airfield on the north shore of Oahu. Military officials confirmed that the five individuals on board were active duty soldiers of the Wheeler Army Airfield’s 25th Combat Aviation Brigade, sometimes referred to as the “Wings of Lightning.”Personnel at Wheeler Army Airfield on Oahu called the Coast Guard Joint Rescue Command Center in Honolulu shortly after 10 p.m. Tuesday to report that they lost communication with the aircrew on one of the Black Hawks. A search began immediately after the other Black Hawk lost contact with the other helicopter. Assisting in the efforts are Coast Guard aircrews on a HC-130 Hercules airplane and a MH-65 Dolphin helicopter, two Coast Guard boat crews, an Army aircrew and on-shore and boat patrols with the Honolulu Fire Department.So far, a part of the helicopter’s fuselage, debris and a helmet have been recovered.The Department of Land and Natural Resources has shut down public access to Kaena Point State Park, less than 2 miles from the Dillingham Airfield, while search efforts are active.Lt. Col. Curtis Kellog said during a press conference Wednesday afternoon that nighttime exercises for aircrews are routine and performed regularly so that aircrews can “maintain competency” for flying at night.He added that the aircrew involved in the crash on Tuesday is an experienced certified Army aircrew. There was no immediate information about the cause of the crash. Kellog did not release the names of the missing crew members, but said their families have been notified of the crash.Last January, two marine helicopters collided in the same area. None of the 12 crew members were ever found, and the Marine Corps declared them dead following a week of extensive searching.The accident raised concerns about an aging fleet plagued by maintenance and readiness issues, Marine Corps Commandant Gen. Robert Neller told a Senate panel last March. This story has been updated with more recent information from the Coast Guard."
