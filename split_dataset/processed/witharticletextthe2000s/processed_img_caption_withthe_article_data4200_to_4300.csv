A day later, Lego announced she would be enshrined forever in glossy plastic.The toy company announced the winner of its semiannual Lego Ideas competition this week: a set honoring five women of NASA. The women are computer scientist Margaret Hamilton, mathematician Katherine Johnson, astronaut Sally Ride, astronomer and executive Nancy Grace Roman and astronaut Mae Jemison. The idea was proposed last year by Maia Weinstock, deputy editor of MIT News. “Women have played critical roles throughout the history of the U.S. space program … yet in many cases, their contributions are unknown or under-appreciated — especially as women have historically struggled to gain acceptance in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM),” Weinstock wrote in her proposal.Lego announced the news Monday on Twitter. “We are really excited to be able to introduce Maia’s ‘Women of NASA’ set for its fun and educational value, as well as its classic build-and-play experience.”“As a science editor and writer, with a strong personal interest for space exploration as well as the history of women in science and engineering, Maia Weinstock’s ‘Women of Nasa’ project was a way for her to celebrate accomplished women in the STEM professions,” Lego Ideas spokeswoman Lise Dydensborg said.The set will become available in late 2017 or early 2018, according to NASA’s Hubble Twitter account.Weinstock thanked followers on Twitter for supporting her Lego Idea.For updates on the project as the set goes into production, fans and future customers can follow Weinstock’s @LegoNASAWomen account on Twitter.This Women’s History Month, remember that we have the power to make history every day. And in 2017, that feels more urgent than ever. Follow along with HuffPost on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram in March using #WeMakeHerstory."

A Supreme Court robe will do just fine.Candice Wilkins helped her twins, Ruby and Cora, dress as Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and retired Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor for their preschool’s “Superhero Day” and shared a photo of them in the Facebook group Pantsuit Nation. Wilkins, a high school government and social studies teacher, told The Huffington Post she began teaching her daughters about their country’s government at an early age. They don’t fully understand the concept of the Supreme Court, but they know about Ginsburg and O’Connor. Wilkins mentioned how the women have made their mark on the world, which intrigued her daughters.“I explained to them that it was ‘Superhero Day’ at school and these women were heroes because they changed the world with their brain, not by wearing a fictional cape and tights,” Wilkins said. “They were then excited to wear the costumes after that! I’ve had a few negative comments that this wasn’t ‘fun’ for them, but it was. They learned about someone new and when you’re 4 and you get to wear anything but your ‘normal’ clothes to school, it’s fun! They had a blast.”To make the girls’ costumes, Wilkins got creative. She purchased everything at the Dollar Tree, including the black tablecloths that she turned into robes. Ruby’s collar for her RBG outfit was made out of a cut-up doily, while Cora’s collar for her take on O’Connor was cut from an undergarment laundry bag. Wilkins also bought glasses and popped the lenses out to complete the Ginsburg look. In December, 8-year-old Michele Threefoot also dressed up as Ginsburg for her school’s “Superhero Day” because she admired her passion for fighting inequality, especially relating to women and girls. Wilkins echoed the girl’s feelings and told HuffPost she appreciates Ginsburg’s ideology and “her spunk and sassiness.” She admires O’Connor for being the first female Supreme Court Justice and a pioneer for women in law.“They are both heroes to me,” Wilkins said. Wilkins told HuffPost she is a “huge supporter of women.” The twins’ dad died in an accident when they were 3 months old, and as a single mom, Wilkins is teaching them to be strong women who can make their mark, just like Ginsburg and O’Connor. “I want to raise them to be smart, strong women and worry more about shattering glass ceilings instead of fitting into glass slippers,” she said. “I tell them all the time that they are smart and beautiful and they have the power to change the world.”The HuffPost Parents newsletter offers a daily dose of personal stories, helpful advice and comedic takes on what it’s like to raise kids today.

The U.N. says the actual number of child soldiers could be far greater.Now approaching its third year, the war has left nearly 19 million Yemenis in need of humanitarian aid, according to a plea for relief assistance from the U.N. A sobering 7 million people in the ailing nation don’t know where their next meal will come from, and now face “a serious risk of famine.”Yemen, which imports 90 percent of its food, only has food reserves for the next two to four months, the Red Cross reported Tuesday. Some 500,000 people living in the port city of Hodeidah are on the brink of famine as fighting intensifies."

Customers can expect goodies from Rocco Princi’s chain of bakeries, as well as small-batch Reserve coffee and, according to a Starbucks spokesperson, beer, wine and spirits as well. “Now we’re going to try, with great humility and respect, to share what we’ve been doing and what we’ve learned through our first retail presence in Italy,” Howard Schultz, CEO of Starbucks, said in a release. “Our first store will be designed with painstaking detail and great respect for the Italian people and coffee culture.” He added, “And, my hope is that we will create a sense of pride for our partners - so much so that every partner who sees our store or walks through the doors will say: ‘We got it right.’”People on Twitter already have a lot to say about Starbucks moving to the holy grail of espresso. Let’s just say they’re not too happy about it: And don’t even get people started on the palm trees Starbucks planted near the Piazza del Duomo in Milan as part of a landscaping project with the city. According to the Los Angeles Times, some people even tried to burn them! “We are happy the way we are,” 70-year-old Milan resident Christine Kung told the LA Times. “We don’t need to be invaded by American scenery.

Mesnard (R) said Monday.Last Wednesday, Senate Bill 1142 passed the state’s upper chamber on a party-line vote, prompting an outcry from watchdogs like the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona over its chilling implications for free speech. Hundreds of people called Mesnard’s office to voice their concerns about the bill, he told The Arizona Republic, leading him to decide against pushing the legislation forward. Regardless of the bill’s intent, the conversation surrounding it had become unavoidably toxic, he said.“At the end of the day, I think the people need to know we are not about limiting people’s rights,” Mesnard told the paper. “The sponsor is not about it, the governor is not about it, the government is not about that. The most efficient, expedient way to communicate that is to kill the bill.”Republicans maintain the legislation was only intended to curb the threat of “paid protesters,” despite there being no evidence such a group exists.Rioting is already illegal in Arizona. But this bill would have greatly increased prosecutors’ ability to pursue rioters, including by redefining what a “riot” is. As The Huffington Post explained last week:Senate Bill 1142 seeks to limit political demonstrations by expanding the definition of a “riot” to include actions that damage property, and making rioting an offense that can be prosecuted under racketeering statutes.“The purported purpose for this bill isn’t based in reality,” Steve Kilar, the communications director for the ACLU of Arizona, told HuffPost last week. “The bill’s supporters are using the false ‘paid protestors’ argument to connect this bill to what is commonly the purpose of anti-racketeering laws: targeting the financial incentives of criminal enterprises.”“But if this bill were to pass, ‘riot’ would join ‘terrorism’ as the only racketeering crimes in Arizona that would not require a financial incentive,” Kilar said.On Monday, the civil liberties organization seemed pleased by the news that the bill was dead:“Although we’re relieved this bill appears to be dead, we still have a lot of work to do nationwide to stop similar attempts to roll back our freedoms of speech and assembly,” Kilar told HuffPost on Tuesday. “This Arizona bill was only one of more than a dozen proposals that have cropped up across the country that are intended to limit, or even criminalize, our ability to protest.”“People are spending time making signs and marching because they want to see change,” he added. “Legislators need to stop trying to silence these efforts. It’s time for them to start listening.”This story has been updated with comments from the ACLU of Arizona."

On Tuesday, FX announced it has ordered a second installment of Ryan Murphy’s “Feud,” which will focus on Princess Diana and Prince Charles. Season 2, appropriately titled, “Feud: Charles and Diana,” is set to air sometime in 2018.The announcement comes before the Sunday premiere of the first installment, “Feud: Bette and Joan.”Earlier this month, Murphy spoke about what he envisioned for future seasons of “Feud,” telling The Hollywood Reporter, “I don’t want to do another woman to woman feud, and I certainly would never do another Hollywood feud because I don’t think you can top Bette and Joan.”“I’m interested in this show being a two-hander that’s really about the human dilemma of pain and misunderstanding,” he said. “And I think you need a long period of time, maybe 20 to 40 years, to have a big back story.”“Feud: Charles and Diana” will be written by Murphy and Jon Robin Baitz, both of whom will also serve as executive producers. The royal-themed series joins Murphy’s impressive roster of FX shows, including “American Crime Story” and “American Horror Story,” which has three more seasons on the way."

In her statement, DeVos praised HBCU’s for providing opportunity to black students during a time when “there were too many students in America who did not have equal access to education.”“They saw that the system wasn’t working, that there was an absence of opportunity, so they took it upon themselves to provide the solution,” says the statement from DeVos, published Tuesday. “HBCUs are real pioneers when it comes to school choice. They are living proof that when more options are provided to students, they are afforded greater access and greater quality.” In truth, many HBCU’s were formed as a matter of necessity when white supremacist structures systematically denied black students access to mainstream educational institutions, says University of Pennsylvania Professor Marybeth Gasman. “I found the statement to be completely ahistorical,” said Gasman, who studies HBCUs. “It completely ignores slavery, it completely ignores Jim Crow, segregation, oppression, mass discrimination across the country, it ignores our entire history. It’s a whitewashing of HBCU history ... African-Americans did not have a choice when black colleges were established ― that was the only thing they could do.” On Twitter, many also questioned the validity of DeVos’ statement, including Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.):Other scholars and civil rights leaders also sounded off.Most HBCUs were founded after the Civil War, when black students were kept from white institutions, Gasman said. “It would be really wonderful if the statement had talked about the origins of HBCUs and admitted to the vast amount of discrimination in the way African-Americans were treated,” Gasman said. “I think there’s absolutely no knowledge on the part of Betsy DeVos when it comes to education in general and specifically when it comes to African American higher education.”President Donald Trump was due to sign an executive order this week around HBCUs. The order is expected to give the White House more control of an HBCU initiative that the Department of Education had previously controlled, CBS reports. UPDATE: On Tuesday afternoon, DeVos gave remarks at an HBCU luncheon that reflected a more nuanced perspective on the history of these institutions.“Providing an alternative option to students denied the right to attend a quality school is the legacy of HBCUs,” she said at the luncheon, according to prepared remarks distributed by the Education Department. “But your history was born, not out of mere choice, but out of necessity, in the face of racism, and in the aftermath of the Civil War.”She also tweeted on the issue.She continued to receive criticism on Twitter for framing HBCUs as an “alternative option” for students who were systematically kept from other institutions. More lawmakers also spoke out against her comments.“Her backwards, utterly confused comments about the history of HBCUs last night only make it clearer how unqualified she is to serve all of our students,” said Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) to democratic leadership."
15,POLITICS,White House Debate Over Terror Term To Be (Kind Of) Resolved In Trump's Joint Address,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mcmaster-trump-radical-islamic-terrorism_us_58b5c9cae4b0a8a9b786a54f,"It's Gen. H.R. McMaster vs. Stephen Miller over ""radical Islamic terrorism."" Who ya got?",2017-02-28,"Lt. Gen. H.R.

President Donald Trump’s joint address to Congress Tuesday night is expected to bring back a long-running semantic debate over whether presidents should use the magic incantation “radical Islamic terrorism” in their speeches or not. It will also settle an internal White House argument over the matter, according to Politico’s Eliana Johnson, Michael Crowley and Shane Goldmacher, and prove which White House adviser truly has the “clout.”In one corner, you have Trump’s new national security adviser, decorated war-fighter Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, who disdains the term. In the other corner, you have a 31-year-old White House senior policy adviser, Stephen Miller, who disdains Muslims in general. Who will win out in the end? Well, this is American politics, where political hackery almost always trumps real-world experience, so ... spoiler alert:President Donald Trump’s new national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, advised him in a closed-door meeting last week to stop using a phrase that was a frequent refrain during the campaign: “radical Islamic terrorism.”McMaster’s stand on the term “radical Islamic terrorism” is noteworthy enough to have generated several media reports, soon after he was tapped to replace his hastily exiting predecessor Michael Flynn, about how McMaster disagreed with the Trump administration on this matter. As The New York Times’ Mark Landler and Eric Schmitt reported, McMaster made a point of noting in his first meeting with staff that “Muslims who commit terrorist acts are perverting their religion,” thereby “rejecting a key ideological view of other senior Trump advisers and signaling a potentially more moderate approach to the Islamic world.”As Brookings senior fellow William McCants told the Times reporters, this view puts McMaster more in line with the Beltway national security community than the new administration:“McMaster, like Obama, is someone who was in positions of leadership and thought the United States should not play into the jihadist propaganda that this is a religious war,” McCants said.Of course, in an administration that has openly expressed its antipathy toward Beltway careerists with a melodramatic hauteur, you probably don’t score too many points for being aligned with agency traditionalists.Perhaps predictably, McMaster’s assertion did not necessarily lead to a good first impression. According to the Guardian’s read-out of that staff meeting, in which McMaster made it clear that he “does not wish to use the term ‘radical Islamic terrorism,’” those in attendance “were struck by the contrast between McMaster’s worldview and that of the president.”Guardian reporter Spencer Ackerman went on to note that “McMaster discomfited White House staffers who view the terrorist threat in those religious terms” to such a degree that they “exchanged awkward looks with each other” during the confab.McMaster’s point of view matches that of Trump’s two immediate predecessors, Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, who both eschewed the term “radical Islamic terrorism.” Obama famously took some stick for doing so, and as Politico reported, McMaster is getting a taste of that as well: “McMaster’s appointment as national security adviser [amid] reports that he endorses the past rhetoric of Obama and Bush has already alarmed members of the self-proclaimed ‘counter-jihad’ community, which views Islam as an inherently violent religion.”Still, the debate rages. According to Politico, McMaster is “in the process of asserting himself” in Trump’s inner circle and is pushing for changes. (According to a White House aide, McMaster believes that even using the term “radical Islamist terrorism” would constitute “an improvement.”) He faces immediate opposition from White House advisers who “fear any sudden change in [Trump’s] rhetoric could open him to charges that he’s abandoning his promise to speak plainly and openly to the American people.” That said, Politico indicated that within the White House, both sides of this debate are open to a “gradual shift” in rhetoric over time. But that shift will apparently not occur soon enough to alter Trump’s speech on Tuesday night.So, as usual, score one for the political hacks.~~~~~Jason Linkins edits “Eat The Press” for The Huffington Post and co-hosts the HuffPost Politics podcast “So, That Happened.” Subscribe here, and listen to the latest episode below.

16,POLITICS,Our Most Unpredictable President Will Deliver Washington’s Most Boring Speech,Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-speech-congress-boring_us_58b5d028e4b060480e0c64dd,"It is ""the worst speech of any possible speech you can write in the White House.""",2017-02-28,How will Donald Trump handle Washington's most scripted speech?,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b5d13f1c00003500463e6d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If past is prologue, President Donald Trump’s first speech to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night will be largely forgotten by Thursday morning. That’s because, despite the hype, these addresses are often bland, overcooked, truly unremarkable affairs. Sure, there is plenty of pomp and circumstance. And every now and then, a line is uttered that takes its rightful place in our collective political consciousness, whether for its historical significance (”The era of big government is over”), controversy (”The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa”), unintentional comedy (”human–animal hybrids”) or shock value (”You lie!”). But by and large, the crafting of a State of the Union or State of the Union-style address is a disheartening exercise for the speechwriter, knowing that the late nights and numerous drafts will have minimal pay-off. “I think there is no other speech where you put in that much time and effort for a speech with an ever-shortening shelf life,” said Jon Favreau, President Barack Obama’s former speechwriter-turned-budding podcast star. “Trump will tweet something the next morning and we will have completely forgotten the speech.” “In my view, the State of the Union is the worst speech of any possible speech you can write in the White House,” said Matt Latimer, a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush. “It is a lot of trouble for almost zero impact. … As soon as it is delivered, it is discussed for 24 hours and not much more than that.” No president, past or present, is under a formal obligation to give an actual speech to Congress. The Constitution requires the president to periodically update lawmakers on the state of the union, and for a good chunk of American history, this involved a written report submitted to the legislative branch. But radio and television made the chance to deliver a speech in person more alluring. And no modern president ― certainly not one as drawn to the promise of a television audience as Donald Trump ― has chosen to scale down the ritual. What has tripped up presidents and their wordsmiths is the demands of the speech itself. This is, as Trump’s team is surely discovering, quite different from a campaign rally. There are rarely any inspiring moments. Instead, speeches to joint sessions of Congress involve defending legislative progress or making the case for legislative priorities. And there are countless stakeholders who care about what’s said. Every federal agency wants to make sure its priorities are discussed. Most members of Congress are invested in seeing their pet projects receive some airtime. Language must be ultra-specific, lest the wrong implication be made. All of which leaves very little space for big, thematic arcs. Latimer recalled how for one speech, Bush adviser Ed Gillespie came up with what he thought was a “clever slogan” that packaged together the evening’s themes. “It was something, frankly, rather hackneyed,” Latimer said. But the group workshopped it and found a way to thread it into the speech. “No one caught on to it. No one remembered it,” Latimer added. Underscoring just how forgettable the line was, he couldn’t remember it either. Trump has, so far, proven to be a more adapt sloganeer. His campaign speeches were defined by rhetorical potshots at and condescending nicknames for his opponents. His inaugural address will be remembered for one jarring phrase: “American carnage.” But Tuesday night’s speech is fundamentally different from those. He has a government to defend now and world crises that must be addressed. Favreau confronted a similar challenge with Obama in February 2009 when they crafted an address amid a teetering economy. “I had imagined a much different speech,” Favreau said. “I would have tried to keep it more like the campaign if not for this crisis. But a good chunk of this speech for us was describing what was in the Recovery Act and what steps were being taken to unlock credit.”It wasn’t the most inspiring of Favreau’s works, and only he and a few others probably remember what the president said then. The literal state of the union is different now. And Trump is far more free-wheeling than Obama (or any other past president, for that matter). So while Favreau and Latimer both predicted that his joint address would succumb to the same soul-crushing bureaucratic pressure that afflicts all State of the Union speeches, they left the door open for something entirely unique. “It could have a longer half-life than most of these State of the Unions do because who knows what he will do. People will tune in just to see what happens,” said Latimer. “Will he go off script? I hope so.” Want more updates from Sam Stein? Sign up for his newsletter, Spam Stein, here."

Kate Brown.",2017-02-28,Oregon Gov. Kate Brown (D) leads one of eight states that has legalized recreational marijuana. She's ready to take up President Donald Trump on his offer to give states more flexibility and freedom in shaping their own laws.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b4ab522900002200beb4a2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― White House press secretary Sean Spicer rattled marijuana advocates last week when he warned that the federal government may start cracking down on states that have legalized recreational marijuana.But that’s not the message President Donald Trump delivered to governors during a private breakfast at the White House on Monday.According to one of the governors in the room, Trump repeatedly told the group he wants states to focus on crafting their own policies without fear of the federal government butting in. The president never mentioned marijuana laws, but for some, his strong defense of states’ rights signaled he’s not about to send the feds after states that are currently regulating the plant on their own.“What I heard from him over and over this morning is they want to give more flexibility to the states,” Oregon Gov. Kate Brown (D) told The Huffington Post in an interview. “He wants to give the states a relative amount of freedom and flexibility. So we will be asking for that around, for example, marijuana policy.”Asked about Spicer’s warnings of federal intervention, Brown said, “It’s totally counter to everything [the president] said today.”Spicer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Marijuana is still illegal at the federal level, but former President Barack Obama’s Justice Department cleared the way for states to forge ahead on their own policies on the drug, for which there has been a dramatic rise in public support for legalization. His administration issued guidance that urged federal prosecutors not to target state-level marijuana operations. That guidance is not law, though, and it can be reversed by Trump.In the meantime, legal recreational marijuana has been approved in eight states and in Washington, D.C. A total of 28 states have legalized marijuana for medical purposes.Brown suggested Trump’s strong belief in states rights, and background as a businessman, could be an asset for governors interested in exploring the economic benefits of legalizing recreational marijuana. Colorado, for one, added nearly $2.4 billion ― that’s a B, for billion ― to the state’s economy in one year.“This is a valuable economic development tool for a number of states,” she said. “It could be a job creator. Let us be in the innovators. Let us be the entrepreneurs in this arena.”"

The political games between Iran and the U.S.; the power game between... I am not even sure who the players are and what motivations they have. I have run out of speculations.The days, hours and seconds pass torturously slowly for me... but time is running out quickly for my 80-year-old father who has been hospitalized twice since his arrest for reasons still unclear to me. I still hope, every second of every day, that reason and justice will prevail and my innocent father and brother will be released and returned home to their loved ones before it is too late."

And then we must open our eyes and say: what price would we pay for that collective freedom? The price for some of us might be to live with less, so that others can have enough. The blunt truth is that when we curtail the billionaire class’s ability to exploit the system – pillaging and stealing from the rest of us – we all live much better and freer.

But dreaming is only the beginning, only one part of “getting free.” We must also fight. This begins with a discerning analysis of the regimes of power we now live under. These are multiple and interrelated: racial capitalism and the neoliberal state that makes the function of racial capitalism possible in the 21st century; heteropatriarchy that “normalizes” hierarchy, violence, coercion and the “unloving of ourselves” in the most intimate places of our lives; and white supremacy, which cleaves the world and history into the deserving and undeserving, the civilized rulers and the uncivilized to be colonized and contained. Revolution is the daunting and exciting invitation to dislodge and dismantle all of these entrenched structures of domination and to not only imagine, but to build something better. To say revolution is a process that begins with dreaming is not to say people should settle for modest reforms and a stagnant state of ongoing “unfreedom.” Rather those interested in fundamental systemic change have to think soberly about the concrete, disciplined, gritty and glorious work of revolution making. While I recognize the enormous importance of local grassroots, community-based organizing, I think this moment, both perilous and promising, demands that we embark on new national debates, and combine forces to build new national organizations.It has been 40 years since Dr. King’s famous “A Radical Revolution of Values” speech, delivered in New York’s Riverside Church, where he declared his opposition to the war in Vietnam on April 4, 1967. He was assassinated exactly one year later. His words are as poignant in 2017 as they were in 1967: “We as a nation must undergo a radical revolution of values. We must rapidly begin … the shift from a thing-oriented society to a person-oriented society. When machines and computers, profit motives and property rights, are considered more important than people, the giant triplets of racism, extreme materialism and militarism are incapable of being conquered.” And with those words, he lays out our challenge. Will we accept it?In addition to the March 8th Women’s strike, which I hope everyone will support, there will be a national day of teaching and learning about resistance movements on April 4, 2017, the anniversary of King’s assassination. Mark your calendars. And many of the leaders of the Movement for Black Lives, immigration justice organizers, Arab and Muslim groups, feminists and LGBTQIA folks will join labor organizers in massive demonstrations on May Day (May 1, 2017) this year.

To say revolution is a process that begins with dreaming is not to say people should settle for modest reforms and a stagnant state of ongoing “unfreedom.” Rather those interested in fundamental systemic change have to think soberly about the concrete, disciplined, gritty and glorious work of revolution making. While I recognize the enormous importance of local grassroots, community-based organizing, I think this moment, both perilous and promising, demands that we embark on new national debates, and combine forces to build new national organizations.It has been 40 years since Dr. King’s famous “A Radical Revolution of Values” speech, delivered in New York’s Riverside Church, where he declared his opposition to the war in Vietnam on April 4, 1967. He was assassinated exactly one year later. His words are as poignant in 2017 as they were in 1967: “We as a nation must undergo a radical revolution of values. We must rapidly begin … the shift from a thing-oriented society to a person-oriented society. When machines and computers, profit motives and property rights, are considered more important than people, the giant triplets of racism, extreme materialism and militarism are incapable of being conquered.” And with those words, he lays out our challenge. Will we accept it?In addition to the March 8th Women’s strike, which I hope everyone will support, there will be a national day of teaching and learning about resistance movements on April 4, 2017, the anniversary of King’s assassination. Mark your calendars. And many of the leaders of the Movement for Black Lives, immigration justice organizers, Arab and Muslim groups, feminists and LGBTQIA folks will join labor organizers in massive demonstrations on May Day (May 1, 2017) this year. Join the revolution!This post is part of the Black Futures Month blog series brought to you by The Huffington Post and the Black Lives Matter Network. Each day in February, look for a new post exploring cultural and political issues affecting the Black community and examining the impact it will have going forward.

21,HEALTHY LIVING,New Food Allergy Guidelines Recommend Introducing Peanuts At 4 To 6 Months Of Age,"Dr. Tim Mainardi , ContributorPhysician, researcher and educator",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-food-allergy-guidelines-recommend-introducing-peanuts_us_58b4c040e4b0658fc20f994d,New landmark federal guidelines are making waves in the allergy community. On January 5 the National Institutes of Health,2017-02-28,<p>Parents should give their young children peanuts </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b4c6d629000023000c38dc.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"New landmark federal guidelines are making waves in the allergy community. On January 5 the National Institutes of Health released new recommendations regarding the introduction of peanut-containing products to infants. These new guidelines call for parents to introduce peanuts into their baby’s diet as early as 4 to 6 months of age, contrary to previous advice.The hope of these new guidelines is to reduce the number of peanut allergies among the nation’s youth. Peanut allergies are one of the most common food allergies in children, and the rate of these allergies tripled between 1997 and 2008. Peanuts are also among the most common allergens that trigger anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction that can become fatal.Many doctors, including those at Hudson Allergy, support the new guidelines as they are in line with new scientific understanding and research that has found that early exposure to peanut-containing foods may prevent the onset of a peanut allergy. Clinical trial results from 2015 showed that peanut consumption started in infancy and continued to 5 years of age resulted in an 81% reduction in peanut allergy development among high risk infants.Some infants may be considered high risk of a peanut allergy. These include babies with a family history of peanut allergy and those with severe eczema or egg allergies. It is recommended that babies at high risk should have their first taste of peanut-containing products at a doctor’s office at 4 to 6 months of age. Babies with mild eczema should be considered moderate risk and can have their first peanut product at home at 6 months of age, according to the new NIH guidelines.The new guidelines recommend that peanuts be introduced to infants as pureed peanut butter or liquefied peanut butter as these are less of a choking hazard than whole peanuts or regular peanut butter. Peanut-containing foods should be introduced after infants have started on solid foods.Living with a peanut allergy can be stressful and requires lifelong diligence with regard to avoidance. Preventing the development of such an allergy can mean an increase in overall quality of life as children age. It also reduces healthcare costs for families.While this recent research and guidelines are encouraging, it is important to note that peanut allergies are still a serious concern for those that live with them. People with peanut allergies should continue to avoid peanuts, carry emergency medication, and visit an allergist as needed."

The teacher, who is forbidden from taking political stances in the classroom, asked them to write or draw what they were feeling. The children all drew and wrote about President Donald Trump or his first major deportation operation. “I’m scared they’ll take my mother or my father,” one student wrote. “I hate you dunel trump [sic].” “I am angry and sad because I thinck I am going to Mexico [sic],” wrote another student. “I don’t speak Spanish. I know English. i am frum Austin [sic].” Another child wrote in Spanish about feeling “very scared because Donal trump says Mexico will pay for the wall and Mexico doesn’t want to.” One student drew a sad face shedding tears.This month’s wave of hundreds of immigration arrests across the country included dozens of people without criminal records — a break with recent practice that has increased anxiety in immigrant communities. Now children are bringing those fears into the classroom, Texas teachers and parents tell The Huffington Post. HuffPost is withholding the names of the teachers because they were not authorized to speak to the media and risk losing their jobs.Any extensive ICE arrests will inevitably affect children — including U.S. citizens — Donald Kerwin, the executive director of the Center for Migration Studies in New York, said, emphasizing the uncertainty that Trump has injected into the immigration debate. His organization estimates that 5.7 million U.S. citizen children nationwide live in households with at least one undocumented parent or close relative. “It’s difficult to think of a crueler fate for a child than to see their parent deported,” Kerwin told HuffPost. “It’s like their world turns upside down on them. Studies show they mourn, have trouble sleeping, their eating patterns change. Some cannot concentrate in school, they’re fearful and some withdraw, while others act out in anger. Beyond losing a parent, they’re often dealing with the sorrow and distress of another adult, typically a second parent.”Earlier this month, a student in a second Central Texas classroom approached his teacher to say his mother was thinking of leaving the United States rather than face the possibility of deportation. The child’s parent left Central America five years ago and is seeking asylum here, but now fears she’ll be deported instead. She doesn’t want to bring her U.S.-born child to the violence-plagued country of her birth. And if she and her brother — the child’s uncle — were deported, her son would be left without an immediate family member to step in as a parent. The parent now says she plans to stay in the United States while her case continues. But to put her mind at ease, her son’s 22-year-old teacher offered to become the child’s legal guardian. “Without thinking, I was like ‘I’ll take him,’” the teacher told HuffPost. “I’d rather know that I did something to help, even if my own life is on pause or I have to take my own steps slower… If I’d done nothing, that would kill me.” The second teacher’s other students and their parents face similar fears, she says. ICE operations in front of a local H-E-B supermarket had left some students too nervous to go shopping. Rather than venture outside and exposing themselves or their parents to ICE, they’re making do with what they have to eat in the house. Some parents worry that ICE agents will follow them if they take their kids to class. “What we’re seeing is a lot of parents who used to pick up their children from school and now they’re sending them on the bus,” a third teacher told HuffPost. “The parents are afraid to come to the school.” One Mexican-born parent, who has legal U.S. permanent residency but worries that her citizenship application might be endangered by Trump’s immigration crackdown, said ICE parked a car within blocks of her daughter’s elementary school last week. “The kids were very scared,” the parent told HuffPost. “Why do they have to be in front of the school? A child shouldn’t have to be living through this.”The anxiety at the schools extends to some of the teachers, according to Montserrat Garibay, the vice president of Education Austin, the teacher’s union. Some Austin instructors are undocumented themselves, but they are allowed to work in the school system through an Obama-era program called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals that shields undocumented immigrants who entered the country as minors from deportation and provides a renewable two-year work authorization. But Trump has offered mixed signals about whether he’ll extend that program, cancel it or allow it to lapse. At least two people with DACA permits were arrested during the wave of immigration arrests over the last two weeks, though one has been released. “It’s an issue that’s bigger than just the students,” Garibay told HuffPost. “We have DACA-mented teachers that are really worried about their jobs,” he said, referring to the work permit program.In theory, schools should not become a focal point of deportation fears. A 2011 policy restricts ICE from arresting people at sensitive places, including churches, funerals and schools. ICE’s brazen actions over the last weeks, however, leave some wondering whether the agency continues to follow it. “To my knowledge, [ICE agents] haven’t entered a school,” Barbara Hines, the former head of the University of Texas at Austin Immigration Law Clinic, said at a conference last week. “But parking next to a school is the same thing.”Students are still concerned, the first teacher said. As ICE swept through Austin, rounding up 51 people in the area, she was teaching lessons about Martin Luther King, Jr. and the civil rights movement for Black History Month, which began Feb. 1. When her students learn about the subject, they see parallels to their own lives, she said. They feel targeted for their brown skin like African-Americans are targeted for being black. “They’ve asked questions like, ‘Why us?’” the teacher, who gave her elementary class the drawing assignment, told HuffPost. “And there’s a lot of talk of Donald Trump. Like, ‘Is he the one doing this? Why does he hate us?’” Since politics are off limits, she answers in the most neutral way she can. “I tell them that just because a person is a leader doesn’t mean that they’re right,” she said. “It’s up to us to make sure that we tell other people so that they know it’s also not right. I tell them even though you think you’re little, it doesn’t mean you can’t teach others.” Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

25,POLITICS,House Intelligence Chairman Not Interested In A Trump-Russia 'Witch Hunt',Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/devin-nunes-trump-russia_us_58b45bb3e4b0a8a9b784c1f8,Rep. Devin Nunes is the guy we're supposed to trust with an investigation.,2017-02-27,"Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) talks to reporters outside the House Intelligence Committee's secure meeting room on Feb. 27, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b471822900002200beb366.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― A combative Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, came before the press on Monday to swat down reports that he inappropriately worked to counter stories about Donald Trump’s ties to Russia at the White House’s request and to once again dismiss calls for a special investigation into those ties.After The Washington Post reported last week that the White House had enlisted intelligence officials and leading lawmakers ― like Nunes and Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) ― to dispute reports that the Trump campaign had repeated contact with Russia, Nunes spoke to journalists to address the controversy.Democrats have openly questioned congressional Republicans’ abilities to properly investigate Trump, considering their ties to him. So when the Post reported that the White House had asked Nunes, a Trump campaign surrogate and a member of the transition team, to talk to a reporter, it bolstered the argument that the intelligence chairman isn’t up to the job of investigating the White House’s ties to Russia.Over the course of his 38-minute press conference, Nunes argued it wasn’t a big deal that the White House had put a reporter in touch with him. “That story was a little odd, I thought,” he said. “Because if you asked me to contact the White House, and said, ‘Hey, could you set me up with someone at the [Department of Defense] or the intelligence agencies,’ I would say, ‘Sure.’”Nunes contended that his relationship with the White House ― and, before that, with the Trump campaign and transition team ― had not compromised his ability to investigate Trump’s ties to Russia. He also challenged a key premise of the Post’s story: that Trump administration officials had recruited him to knock down reports of contact between Russia and the campaign.“That didn’t happen. That absolutely didn’t happen,” Nunes said.He did acknowledge that the White House had asked him to convey unclassified information about the Trump campaign’s contact with Russia with a reporter ― that is, that there was no known, substantial contact ― but he pointed out that he had already been doing that with reporters on Capitol Hill.“What I’ve been told by many folks is that there is nothing there,” he said.The Intelligence Committee is investigating Russian attempts to influence the U.S. presidential election, as well as potential communications between Trump’s associates and Russian intelligence officials. But Nunes said he’s not aware of any evidence showing contact between Russia and the campaign.Yet Nunes did say he and his committee had not ruled out everything, and that it was clear Russia has long shown interest in manipulating elections and the press.“But, at this time, I want to be very careful that we can’t just go on a witch hunt against Americans because they appear in news stories,” Nunes said, specifically mentioning former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, who was identified as one the officials talking to Russia.Nunes disputed the New York Times’ report that the Trump campaign had repeated contact with Russian officials over the phone. “As of right now, I don’t have any evidence of any phone calls,” he said.The California Republican has seemed reluctant to investigate Trump, though he insists the Intelligence Committee has been working diligently behind the scenes to check out reports of Russian election meddling.When a reporter asked why there shouldn’t be a special independent investigation, Nunes said the history of those special investigations and prosecutors were mixed and they would simply be chasing stories.Nunes did speak about one aspect of recent Trump controversy he is interested in: leaks.He said he was concerned the press had learned that Michael Flynn, Trump’s future national security adviser, had discussed details of U.S. sanctions against Russia with the Russian ambassador prior to Trump’s inauguration. When it emerged that Flynn had lied to the press and the vice president about that discussion, he was forced to resign.While Nunes was very interested in finding out who leaked details of Flynn’s call to the press, he wasn’t concerned that Flynn had potentially undermined the Obama administration’s policies by promising to undo sanctions against Russia.“I don’t know that that’s what was said, but if that was said, I don’t know what the problem would be with that,” Nunes said.When one reporter pressed whether one administration negotiating against the other would be a violation of the Logan Act, which prohibits unauthorized individuals from negotiating with foreign governments, Nunes sneered.“So you want to investigate a Logan Act? You’re a Logan Act guy?” he asked.Another reporter replied that it was the law, but Nunes wasn’t having it.“It’s ridiculous,” he said. “The Logan Act’s ridiculous. You guys all know that’s ridiculous.”"

On its surface, the film, directed by Byron Howard and Rich Moore, follows a bunny named Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) as she tries to establish herself as a police officer in the animal-run metropolis of Zootopia.But underneath the surface of “Zootopia” is a message about the dangers of stereotyping and discriminating in a multicultural world ― in the case of “Zootopia,” one with co-existing predators and prey ― and the types of people (and animals) who win and lose when we do. Director Byron Howard told Variety that when he and Rich Moore pitched the film to Disney, “bias and discrimination didn’t seem like the most mainstream” topic for a children’s movie.But by the time it was in production, the world around them had changed. Protests were raging over the mistreatment of black men and women in Ferguson, Missouri, making them feel as if they had an obligation to tackle the issues of prejudice as “honestly” as they could.After that, the film only continued to gain in relevancy with the fear-based rise of President Donald Trump’s popularity, “which is what [the film’s] entire third act is about, our villain is using fear to stoke division,” Howard said. “I don’t think we could have predicted it any closer with this film,” he added. After its March release, “Zootopia” quickly became one of the biggest hits of 2016. The filmed received positive reviews from 98 percent of critics, tied for the highest percentage of any film last year, according to Rotten Tomatoes.At the box office, “Zootopia” performed just as well, pulling in $340 million domestically and more than $1 billion worldwide.

Public defender Michael McCulloch was assigned to his case. Purinton is scheduled to appear in court again the morning of March 9. Purinton is charged with first-degree murder and two counts of attempted first-degree murder in the shooting of Srinivas Kuchibhotla, Alok Madasani and Ian Grillot on Wednesday at Austin’s Bar and Grill in Olathe.Kuchibhotla, 32, died of his wounds. Madasani, 32, and Grillot, 24, survived. Although Kansas does not have a hate crime law, the FBI is investigating the shooting as a possible federal hate crime. Dinesh Kansal, an Indian-American resident of Olathe, said he came to the courthouse Monday to get a good look at Purinton.“I want to know why this idiot did what he did,” Kansal told The Huffington Post, adding that the shooting is “giving this town a bad name all over the world.” Kuchibotla and Madasani, both immigrants from India, were regulars at Austin’s Bar and Grill, where they often enjoyed a post-work whiskey after leaving their jobs at Garmin, a technology company that makes GPS navigation devices. According to witnesses, Purinton was also drinking at Austin’s that night, and yelled “get out of my country” to the two men.“He asked us what visa are we currently on and whether we are staying here illegally,” Madasani recounted to The New York Times.Purinton was eventually kicked out of the bar, but returned a short time later with a gun. He opened fire, killing Kuchibotla and seriously wounding Madasani.Another customer at the bar, Ian Grillot, hid beneath a table during the shooting. After hearing nine shots, Grillot said he thought the gun’s magazine was empty and got up to apprehend Purinton. Purinton then shot him in the chest and hand.Purinton fled the scene. Later that night, police received a call from an Applebee’s bartender 70 miles away in Missouri. She said a man was there drinking, and had confessed to having just shot two “Iranians,” KMBC reported. Police arrived a short time later and arrested Purinton. Purinton served in the Navy for two years in the late 1980s and later worked for the Federal Aviation Administration. He does not have a lengthy criminal record. Johnson County court records show a DUI charge that was dismissed.Purinton’s neighbors told various media outlets that he had PTSD, was a heavy drinker, and was struggling with the recent loss of his father. Kuchibhotla’s body was scheduled to be shipped back to India Monday for a funeral. His death has received national attention in his home country, where many are wondering whether the xenophobic rhetoric of President Donald Trump has made America unsafe for immigrants. Sunayana Dumala, Kuchibhotla’s wife, told reporters this weekend that she couldn’t sleep after Trump’s election victory in November. “I was like, ‘Srini, will we be safe in this country?” she recounted saying to her husband. “I think hate crimes will be more open now. Will it be safe for us to go to the mall? For us to go to [the] office?”Despite calls for him to do so, Trump has yet to address last week’s shooting. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said at a press briefing Friday that it was “absurd” to link the Olathe shooting to Trump’s stance on immigration. At another press briefing Monday, Spicer said that although he didn’t want to get ahead of law enforcement’s investigation of the shooting, early reports out of Olathe were “disturbing.”A massive vigil was held for the three shooting victims Sunday in Olathe. Madasani arrived on crutches. “I wish it was a dream,” Madasani told the crowd of the shooting, according to The Kansas City Star.“It was rage and malice in an individual’s heart that killed my friend ... killed our friend,” he said. “It’s an isolated incident that doesn’t reflect the true spirit of Kansas, Midwest and United States.”“I want to take this opportunity to ask ... all of you for tolerance of our diversity and for respect of humanity,” he added. “I hope I’m not asking too much, because that is what my friend would have wanted.”America does not do a good job of tracking incidents of hate and bias.

But there was an especially dramatic plunge after he signed a now-suspended executive order on travel Jan. 27 that barred some immigrants and visitors from majority Muslim nations from entering the country, according to data from the travel site Hopper. The U.S. lost about $185 million in business travel bookings the week after Trump’s travel ban took effect, according to a report from the Global Business Travel Association, which represents corporate travel managers and professionals. Business travel to and from the U.S. had been increasing the week before the ban was instated, but it decreased the week after by more than two percent.That may sound like a small percentage, but it’s a yuge deal: For every 1 percent change in business travel spending annually, the U.S. loses 71,000 jobs and nearly $5 billion in gross domestic product, according to the GBTA.Other economists found that Los Angeles County alone could lose the equivalent of $736 million in tourism spending over three years as a result of Trump’s travel ban, The New York Times reported. “There was too much uncertainty and a lack of clarity around the executive order, leading to general confusion,” the GBTA wrote in a blog post. “The net effect was that business travel bookings were delayed or canceled.”About half of its European members reported their companies plan to cut back on business travel over the next three months, the GBTA said. The group was polled before a judge issued a temporary restraining order that halted Trump’s ban. Dips in travel happen often, of course, but it appears Trump’s travel ban is the specific cause for this one. Hannah Sampson, a business travel analyst at Skift, says her conversations with corporate leaders are further proof: Many don’t want to send their employees overseas for fear Trump will pull another ban that could leave them stuck, she says.“Companies who are responsible for travelers just don’t want to take the risk,” Sampson told HuffPost. “There’s a lot of overarching caution right now.”It’s ironic that a president promising to bolster U.S. businesses would cause a dip in business travel. Overall travel is taking a hit right along with it, according Hopper’s analysis of searches from multiple engines. As of Feb. 22, flight searches to the U.S. from other countries had declined 17 percent since Trump’s inauguration, compared to Barack Obama’s final weeks in office, Hopper said. There was a mere 1.8 percent decline over a similar time period in 2016, and a 5 percent decline over a similar period in 2015. According to the Times, Cheapflights.com saw international searches for flights to the U.S. drop 38 percent in the three days after Trump signed the executive order. This fluctuation is not normal, according to Hopper: “There is more than a simple seasonal variation going on,” a spokesman told HuffPost in a statement. Searches dropped significantly following the travel ban in 103 of the 122 countries for which Hopper has data, with an average drop of 22 percent.In an extremely abnormal surge, flight searches from Russian travelers rose a whopping 88 percent from three weeks before the inauguration through Feb. 7. Trump’s travel ban was suspended in court earlier this month, and he is expected to sign a replacement executive order this week. Wanna escape all the drama? We know just the place. "
32,POLITICS,Bill Nye Warns Trump Administration Could Have ‘Catastrophic’ Effect On The Planet,Hayley Miller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bill-nye-donald-trump-administration-catastrophic-climate_us_58b43d04e4b060480e0a0f8f,"“If you want to kill birds, fossil fuels are terrific,"" the Science Guy told Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).",2017-02-27,Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) asks Bill Nye questions about climate change during a Facebook Live interview Monday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b45cfa2800002100630cf7.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Bill Nye says President Donald Trump’s anti-science policies could have devastating ramifications for the environment and humanity.The celebrity scientist railed against Trump administration climate change skeptics Monday during a Facebook Live interview with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), an outspoken advocate for climate action and renewable energy development.“The longterm implications are potentially catastrophic,” Nye told the 2016 presidential candidate. “The problem is the speed at which the world is warming. It’s not that the climate is changing ― it’s the rate.”Nye, best known for hosting the popular ‘90s children’s television show “Bill Nye the Science Guy” and the upcoming Netflix series “Bill Nye Saves the World,” went on to explain the damaging consequences of ignoring climate change.“Half the people in the world live near coastlines. As the ocean gets a tiny bit warmer, it gets a tiny bit bigger. But the ocean is big and a tiny bit is huge,” Nye said, referencing scientific reports that show rising sea levels caused by climate change could engulf many major cities.The Earth’s temperature has surged in the recent decade: 2016 was the hottest year on record and January 2017 was 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit above the 20th century average. A report from the Copernicus Climate Change Service earlier this month found that the average global surface temperature soared to 58.6 degrees Fahrenheit in 2016, approximately 2.3 degrees Fahrenheit above pre-industrial times.Sanders, who holds positions on the Senate’s energy and environmental committees, hosted the live stream on his Facebook page to help viewers better understand the “global crisis of our time.”Trump, who once called global warming a hoax “created by and for the Chinese,” has pledged to “cancel” the 2015 Paris Agreement, a landmark global accord that more than 100 nations have signed to reduce carbon emissions and prevent dangerous increases in global temperatures. The president is also promising to revive America’s coal industry instead of focusing on developing cleaner renewable energy.Climate change skeptics pepper the Trump administration, including new Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt, who sued the agency 14 times during his tenure as Oklahoma attorney general. He’s also vowed to roll back some of former President Barack Obama’s most progressive initiatives to combat climate change.Nye is baffled by government officials who deny humans’ impact on the earth’s rapidly warming temperature and changing climate, despite conclusions drawn by 97 percent of climate scientists.“The science is settled, everybody,” Nye said. “There’s overwhelming proof. Proof isn’t the word. There’s overwhelming evidence.”Nye also took a dig at conservative news outlet Fox News during his Q&A with Sanders.“The one thing that really is hard for me about Fox News is the denial of climate change and science,” Nye said. “Many of the other things they assert are troubling, but that one is the one that just crosses the line for me.”Still, Nye remains hopeful. He said that Trump’s tendency to contradict himself (see: his relationship with Russia President Vladimir Putin, his opinion of the electoral college, etc.) could be a signal he might also change his position on climate change in the future.“We can solve this problem, everyone,” Nye said. “It is reasonable to me that if we can show an economic benefit to turning things around, we could turn things around. ... I think if we can get these people to just look at the world a little differently they will be on the side of domestically produced renewable electricity.”Trump claims wind power, an increasingly popular source of renewable energy, “kills all the birds” and is “ugly.” But Nye refuted the president’s assertions, pointing to coal-fired electricity plants as much more deadly for birds.“If you want to kill birds, fossil fuels are terrific,” he joked.Not only is investing in renewable energy, such as wind and solar power, good for the environment, but it would boost U.S. job creation, Nye said.“Even if the wind turbine blades are designed in Sweden or Finland or Denmark, you have to put them up, you have to erect the turbines here,” Nye told Sanders. “There’s a huge [economic] opportunity.”How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

As many as 100 tombstones were damaged at Mount Carmel over the weekend, according to CNN. Police, who are still searching for the culprits, classified the incident as institutional vandalism. When he heard that a cemetery had been vandalized a few miles from his home, El-Messidi reportedly rushed to the cemetery to offer his support. In a “I’ve been speaking to some of the rabbis at the cemetery ... and I’ve told them that we Muslims will help again,” El-Messidi said in the video. “We’re in a very difficult time in the United States when people cannot even rest in peace after they pass away, where people have to be worried about their ancestors’ graves,” he added.Last Tuesday, El-Messidi and Sarsour created a LaunchGood campaign encouraging Muslims to donate funds to help repair the Chesed Shel Emeth Cemetery in Missouri. More than 150 of the century-old Jewish cemetery’s headstones were toppled over during the weekend of Feb. 18. Within three hours of launching, the fundraiser reached its initial goal of $20,000. The organizers then pledged that any excess funds raised in the campaign would assist other vandalized Jewish centers nationwide.By Monday, more than 4,500 people had donated close to $135,000. “We must stand together against these acts of racism, anti-Semitism, and Islamophobia,” El-Messidi wrote on Facebook. Muslims from the local Ahmadiyya community also came out to the Philadelphia cemetery to help clean up. The New York Times reports that it will cost between $450 and $500 to fix each headstone.The Anti-Defamation League is offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of those responsible for toppling headstones at Mount Carmel Cemetery. Fraternal Order of Police Lodge Five added $3,000 to the reward.The vandalism of Jewish cemeteries coincides with a rise in reports of anti-Semitism around the country. Jewish community centers have received five waves of phoned-in bomb threats since the beginning of the year. Although no bombs have been found at the centers, the threats have left Jewish leaders on edge. The most recent wave of bomb threats happened Monday morning when at least 20 Jewish community centers and day schools received threatening phone calls.Yosef Goldman, a local rabbi with Temple Beth Zion – Beth Israel, said on Facebook that he has been heartened by the interfaith response to the vandalism in Philadelphia.“Acts of violence against Muslim and Jews will only make us stronger and bring us together,” Goldman wrote on Facebook."

Presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway had just awarded the Oscar for Best Picture to “La La Land.” The only problem was they were supposed to give “Moonlight” that honor, and there had been a terrible mix-up behind the scenes.Here’s the entire moment as it played out on live TV: The veteran actors took to the stage to present the final award of the night. As Beatty read the card in the envelope, he looked visibly confused. He checked the envelope more than once, paused, looked to Dunaway, started to announce the winner, and then passed the envelope to his co-presenter, who promptly said, “La La Land.”According to Jeffrey Fleishman, senior writer on film, art and culture at the Los Angeles Times, the ceremony’s backstage crew immediately began to panic:“As the ‘La La Land’ cast was taking the stage to celebrate, a stagehand in the wings said, ‘Oh ... Oh my god, he got the wrong envelope.’ They walked back and forth repeating it.”Only two humans on the planet know the Oscar winners in advance, and that’s PricewaterhouseCoopers’ Brian Cullinan and Martha Ruiz. After stuffing the envelopes and locking them in a briefcase, they memorize the list of winners. Just last week, the duo blogged on The Huffington Post about the process, and described a meticulous system for ensuring there were no mistakes:“We hand each envelope directly to the presenter in each category. We are positioned on either side of the stage, so we can hand envelopes from stage right or stage left, depending on where the presenter is entering.

(REUTERS/Carlo Allegri)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b4478f2900002200beb297.jpeg?cache=CFNfiHwm8P&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Jonathan AllenNEW YORK (Reuters) - Supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump are holding rallies in towns and cities across the country on Monday, partly as a rebuttal to waves of anti-Trump protests that have taken place since the Republican’s election last November.Trump is not scheduled to appear at any of this week’s rallies, which are being held in cities small and large, from coast to coast. The venues range from a park in the small town of Gravette, Arkansas, to the plaza outside the Georgia State Capitol building in downtown Atlanta.Some of the rally organizers came out of the Tea Party movement, a large informal network of anti-establishment conservatives that has become an increasingly powerful force in Republican politics since its beginnings in 2009.A group called Main Street Patriots said it helped organize so-called Spirit of America rallies in at least 33 of the 50 states, both on Monday and Saturday.“Unlike those protesting against President Trump’s vision, we are a diverse coalition that are the heart and soul of America that wants our nation to fulfill our potential, as the greatest nation on God’s green earth!” organizers wrote on the group’s website.“Blue-collar voters helped propel President Trump to victory and these rallies will help provide those forgotten voices a mechanism so they can be heard,” they said.Raucous rallies, often filling sports arenas, became a hallmark of Trump’s 17-month presidential campaign, in contrast with lower-key events staged by his main rival, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party’s candidate.Last weekend, Trump rekindled that campaign energy for the first time since his election in a characteristically freewheeling rally in Melbourne, Florida.But Trump’s crowds have rarely regrouped since November’s election, while large protests by people who opposed Trump’s policies, particularly his crackdown on immigration, have become a frequent occurrence in the country’s cities.Among the biggest was the Women’s March on Washington on Jan. 21, where attendance far exceeded the crowds who attended Trump’s inauguration the previous day.Betty Blanco, who is organizing the Spirit of America rally in Denver, was in Washington for the women’s march. She said she was saddened by what she saw.“I had the opportunity to ride on the subway with the women marchers,” she said in a telephone interview. “They were excited, they were happy, but I never heard them talking about women’s rights, but I did hear them trashing Trump, and I got the idea they were just mad because they lost the election.”The retired schoolteacher, who now writes children’s books and runs a local Tea Party affiliate, said the pro-Trump rallies would be more respectful, even if they might not prove quite as large.“I don’t know that you’ll see those big, gigantic, hundreds of thousands of people like the Women’s March,” said Rob Maness, a 55-year-old former Air Force colonel in New Orleans helping organize the nationwide effort. “I think they’ll be smaller, patriotic, peaceful - those kind of things.”(Reporting by Jonathan Allen; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)"
37,MEDIA,Trump Will Lunch With The 'Enemy' Ahead Of His Congressional Address,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-state-of-the-union-lunch_us_58b48257e4b0a8a9b78527be,The president is also inviting some media guests who may be friendlier.,2017-02-27,President Donald Trump will dine with top news anchors before he speaks to Congress on Tuesday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b482b52800002000630db3.jpeg?cache=iIc0aIjPUX&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Although President Donald Trump broke with tradition this weekend by declining to attend the upcoming White House Correspondents Dinner, he will continue a long-running White House custom of lunching with top network anchors ahead of Tuesday’s primetime congressional address. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer confirmed Monday that Trump will sit down with representatives from the “big five” networks ― presumably ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox and CNN. In addition, Spicer said, the White House has invited Telemundo, Univision, the Christian Broadcasting Network, C-SPAN, PBS, TV One, One America News Network and the Catholic network EWTN.Past presidents have used the luncheon to preview policy proposals they would lay out in their State of the Union address or, as it’s described in the president’s first year in office, their speech before a joint session of Congress. The lunchtime discussion is typically off the record, although Fox News anchor Shepard Smith is known to provide mouth-watering descriptions of the menu.Trump’s sit-down with top news anchors comes less than two weeks after he declared the media to be the “enemy of the American people.”This past Friday, speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Trump suggested that by using the phrase “fake news media,” he was not attacking the media as a whole. He also baselessly claimed that journalists fabricate sources in order to mislead the public. Hours later, his White House staff barred several news outlets that aggressively cover the administration from a non-televised press briefing. Trump announced Saturday that he would not attend the White House Correspondents Dinner in late April, the first president to bow out in more than three decades. Several news organizations have canceled events surrounding the dinner and others are deliberating whether to attend given the heated anti-press rhetoric. In addition to shaking things up by inviting several outlets not previously included in the pre-congressional address lunch, the Trump White House is also holding a separate dinner with regional news organizations. On Monday night, Trump will dine at the White House with representatives of 18 press affiliates from across the country. This presidential engagement with regional media comports with Spicer’s use Skype to bring in reporters from local TV affiliates and conservative hosts who haven’t typically been part of White House press briefings. The daily briefings are attended largely by members of the national news media. "

The standout accessory of the night was Stone’s subtle nod to Planned Parenthood, one that many may have missed on first glance. The 28-year-old, who won an Oscar for Best Actress for her leading role in “La La Land,” wore a small, gold Planned Parenthood pin on the left side of her gown. If you missed it, take a closer look at the subtle pin below. Stone wasn’t the only one to wear her activism on her sleeve. Ruth Negga, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Karlie Kloss and Busy Philipps all wore blue ACLU ribbons as a sign of solidarity with marginalized groups in the Trump era. Whether it’s a blue ribbon or a gold Planned Parenthood pin ― we love all of these accessories. More of this, please. "

The company announced Thursday that their humanitarian division, Google.org, pledged a total of $11.5 million toward research and data analysis for organizations dedicated to achieving racial equality.Among the organizations the tech giant provided funding for were the Equal Justice Initiative, Center for Policing Equity, Measures for Justice and Impact Justice. A majority of the organizations are centered on criminal justice reform. The idea for the pledge came after members of the company’s Black Googler Network researched national policing data after repeated high-profile incidents of police brutality over the summer, Justin Steele, principal at Google.org, told CNN Tech. “We were finding that the data in this space is really minimal,” Steele said. “[So] we started looking at [giving] grants around data science, policing and sentencing.”In 2015, Google gave $2.35 million to organizations involved in Black Lives Matter activism, despite the “controversy” that surrounded the movement.In addition to organizations focused on the black community, Google has also been very vocal about its support for LGBTQ citizens.

One of the hosts of the Emmy Award-winning “NBA on TNT,” Barkley ― who captured league MVP honors in 1993, earned 11 All-Star appearances and is a two-time Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductee ― spoke with The Huffington Post recently to discuss Cleveland’s struggles, why the race for the championship is only between three teams and what is wrong with today’s NBA.This interview has been edited for length and clarity.You teamed up with Autotrader and Second Harvest Food Bank of Greater New Orleans. Why have you made it a priority to help those in need? It’s interesting ― the greatest country in the world, we shouldn’t have people starving. We shouldn’t have young people not getting something to eat. You seem to have very much targeted kids in dire need. Kids are born into the situation they’re born into, and obviously they have no control over that. And we, as adults, it’s up to us to take care of kids ― that’s part of your moral responsibility. I always tell people, “There’s two groups we should take care of ― old people and young people.” And this is just my small little way of helping.You recently attended All-Star Weekend in New Orleans. You’re 54 now. Does it maintain the same appeal, the same mystique for you it once did? It’s not the same for me now, because, I mean, we work so much. We’re on every day for hours and hours. The All-Star Game was fun when I played in it because it was an amazing weekend, but it’s a little bit different now that I’m doing television, because man, it’s hectic.  What is the bigger first-half NBA surprise to you: the Spurs’ success or the Cavs’ struggles?What [the Spurs have] done the last 20 years has just been amazing. Obviously they’ve won five championships, but to be competitive every year, it says a lot. Listen, I don’t think the Cavaliers have struggled as much as people think ― I think the Cavaliers have been bored, because they realized they’re going to win the Eastern Conference unless somebody [made] a trade. So I think they’ve just been bored more than anything. Are we merely staring down at a three-horse race for the title, between Golden State, San Antonio and Cleveland? Yeah, I think that’s very safe to say, and that’s one thing that bothers me about the NBA today. We shouldn’t have just three good teams ― that drives me nuts. And then people tell me [that when I played], “the same team always won the championship.” Well I say, first of all, that’s not true. The Bulls won, the Spurs won, the Pistons won, the Lakers won. But they were all pushed. Like, we know the Cavaliers are going to be in the finals ― I mean, they don’t even get pushed. Even Michael [Jordan’s] Bulls, remember ― people forget they had some great seven-game series with the Knicks, they had some great seven-game series with the Pacers. They were always pushed. It wasn’t like, “Well, they’re gonna get to the finals.” There were a couple times even when the Bulls won the championship, they had some knock-down, drag-out games with the Knicks and the Pacers. It wasn’t just like a cakewalk like it is now. Just how impressive is Houston with James Harden and Mike D’Antoni?Yes, I think everybody is [surprised], but it goes to the genius of Mike D’Antoni and the great work that James Harden has done. I don’t think anybody thought that the Rockets would be playing this well, but Mike D’Antoni is doing the same thing he did in Phoenix ― he’s just an offensive genius, plain and simple.Should D’Antoni then be Coach of the Year and Harden the league MVP? Well, I think simply Harden and [Russell] Westbrook are the two front-runners for MVP. I think you have to pick your poison on that one. They both look great. And D’Antoni is clearly the front-runner, and now who’s probably gaining on Mike D’Antoni is Scott Brooks ― he’s doing a fantastic job in Washington. Speaking of the Wizards, what changed for that team? They were a lifeless 2-8 ― dead in the water ― at the beginning of the season.Well, [John] Wall said he got in shape. People forget he had knee surgery on both knees and it took him a while to get into shape. But if you actually looked at it on paper, I think the Wizards probably have the most talent that can compete with the Cavaliers. They played probably the best NBA game I’ve seen in years. But if you look at it, they’re probably the second best guard combination in the NBA.Listen, Otto Porter is playing out of his mind, [Markieff] Morris is playing out of his mind. I worry about their depth, but if you look at it from just a talent standpoint, the Wizards probably have the second best team in the Eastern Conference.Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com, ask me questions about anything sports-related on Twitter at @Schultz_Report, and follow me on Instagram at @Schultz_Report.

I worry about their depth, but if you look at it from just a talent standpoint, the Wizards probably have the second best team in the Eastern Conference.Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com, ask me questions about anything sports-related on Twitter at @Schultz_Report, and follow me on Instagram at @Schultz_Report.

On Saturday, in a state Senate district in Delaware that stretches from Middletown to Newark, the voices in the streets turned into votes in the ballot box. In the most expensive special election in Delaware history ― a contest to decide which party controls the state Senate ― Democrat Stephanie Hansen was on track to annihilate her Republican rival on the back of extraordinary turnout.The last time her opponent, John Marino, ran in this district, in 2014, he lost by just 2 points. Hansen’s 58-42 percent victory over Marino on Saturday ensured that Democrats will maintain control of the state Senate. It also notched a big Donald Trump-era win for a new generation of Democratic activists shocked into action by the November election.“We turned back that win from Washington and made sure it won’t hit Delaware,” Hansen said in her victory speech Saturday night.While Hansen’s campaign was focused on local issues, she saw a huge swell of support after nationwide Women’s March protests on Jan. 21. Protesters, many of them out in the streets for the first time, have been turning their energy toward local and state politics. The first major election since the uprising was Delaware’s. Hansen’s campaign received huge support. More than 1,000 volunteers worked during the course of the campaign, and about 500 ― many from nearby states ― showed up Saturday for Election Day. Hansen received more than 14,000 contributions of less than $100 from small donors spread all over the country.“That’s more volunteers than I’ve had in nine elections,” exclaimed state Sen. Dave Sokola (D), of Hansen’s Election Day workers.“It’s overwhelming to see all these people,” said Kelly Wright, a resident of Hansen’s district. “It’s making me emotional to see that people come take a bus two-plus hours away.”The turnout of volunteers made a huge difference as Hansen crushed her Republican opponent with unusually high turnout for a special election.“Let’s take this movement national,” former Vice President Joe Biden. a Delaware resident, exhorted to Hansen victory partiers Saturday night via phone.Chuck Jackson, a Democratic district chair, said: “It’s really great the amount of people we’re seeing out. There is so much at stake.”The state Senate had been split 10-10 since the 10th District seat was vacated in November by Bethany Hall-Long, who won election as lieutenant governor. Hansen’s win maintains Democrats’ 44-year hold on the chamber.Hansen’s election was no sure thing. The district leans Democratic, but Republican Marino had performed well in previous elections. Hall-Long defeated Marino by 1 percentage point in 2014. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won the district 54-41 over Trump. Democrats notoriously struggle in special elections.The Democratic campaign was both aided and hindered by weather. At an unseasonable 70 degrees it was a perfect day for volunteers to knock on doors and for voters to head out to the polls. An afternoon thunderstorm, however, cut an hour out of a prime time.While the race brought in huge numbers of outside volunteers, it was mostly fought over local issues like transit, the environment, education and the state budget. Erik Schramm, Hansen’s campaign manager, said the campaign had to juggle messaging to highlight local issues while harnessing the national mood to excite volunteers.Groups like Sister District, Flippable and Indivisible helped organize volunteers. For many, this was the first time they had been involved in a political campaign. Mitchaell Kawash, a volunteer from Brooklyn, New York, said he was canvassing for the first time because of the importance of state-level politics. Nicholas Sewitz, who previously canvassed for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), joined Kawash and other friends from Brooklyn. “Trump is politicizing the populace,” Sewitz said.Marsha Murray and Sarah Kimball came from Lower Manhattan to volunteer. For Kimball, it was her first time canvassing.”This is the election that matters,” said Murray. “It matters to everyone, not just in Delaware.”Ken Kidd, a volunteer who came from Manhattan, said the Women’s March and rising activism has led to a “resurgence in citizenship.” Volunteers were greeted at the Middletown campaign office in the afternoon by a steady parade of elected officials. Sens. Tom Carper (D) and Chris Coons (D) came by to shake hands and thank volunteers. Lt. Gov. Bethany Hall-Long, the previous occupant of the state Senate seat, stopped at the office after canvassing neighborhoods. Coons said he was “encouraged” by volunteers’ organization. Volunteer Jim Yung, wearing a U.S. Senate baseball hat signed by Joe Biden, said: “Make no bones about it, it’s made a difference.”There’s something fitting about so many New Yorkers making the trip down to make sure Marino didn’t become a senator: He is, after all, a retired NYPD cop.This article has been updated to include a comment from Hansen’s victory speech."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b33e392900001f000c33c9.jpeg?cache=dCjN0nLJ7S&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Former Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell, who has served as domestic policy chair of President Donald Trump’s transition team, told me in an interview on SiriusXM Progress that the controversial “religious freedom” order that leaked to the press a few weeks ago is very much on the way, even though White House officials had played it down. Earlier this month, The Nation’s Sarah Posner reported on the draft order, which would allow exemptions for those who oppose same-sex marriage, premarital sex, abortion, and trans identity, among many other things: The four-page draft order, a copy of which is currently circulating among federal staff and advocacy organizations, construes religious organizations so broadly that it covers “any organization, including closely held for-profit corporations,” and protects “religious freedom” in every walk of life: “when providing social services, education, or healthcare; earning a living, seeking a job, or employing others; receiving government grants or contracts; or otherwise participating in the marketplace, the public square, or interfacing with Federal, State or local governments. At the time, Trump administration officials claimed the draft was among hundreds of draft orders circulating within the administration. ”We do not have plans to sign anything at this time but will let you know when we have any updates,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a White House spokesperson, told ABC News at the time.But Blackwell, a senior fellow at the Family Research Council (deemed an anti-LGBTQ hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center), said in our interview at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) over the weekend that the order is far from dead. He also confirmed that the former director of Family Research Council’s Center for Religious Liberty, Ken Klukowski, had “actually structured” the draft order as a legal advisor to the Trump transition team. Klukowski, who is now a senior attorney at the Liberty First Institute and a Breitbart contributor, is one of the lawyers “in the process of redrafting it,” Blackwell said, hinting that the original order may have been perceived as being too vulnerable to a legal challenge.“In the final analysis, what we want is an executive order that will meet the scrutiny of the judicial process,” he explained. “If there is no executive order, that will disappoint [social conservatives]. But a good executive order will not. So we’re still in the process.” Blackwell envisions the “anchor concept” of the order as one that will allow people with devoutly religious beliefs to turn away LGBTQ people in the course of business.“I think small business owners who hold a religious belief that believes that traditional marriage is between one man and one woman should not have their religious liberty trampled upon,” he explained. “I would imagine that that will be, strongly and clearly, the anchor concept [of the order].” (In an interview with me at the Republican National Convention in 2008, Blackwell had explained that he doesn’t view LGBTQ people as a class of people who are discriminated against, but rather sees homosexuality as a “compulsion that can be contained, repressed or changed.”) Asked for comment about Blackwell’s statements at CPAC, Klukowski said that “because it’s been publicly disclosed by people on the transition team that I worked on the transition,” he was “not at liberty to speak about” the order specifically.“More broadly and as a private citizen [however],” Kuklowski added, “on the president and religious liberty: The president said when he was a candidate that there is a war on Christianity in America. And as someone who is a religious liberty lawyer who frequently represents the evangelical and Catholic communities in this country, that’s exactly the sort of language that most people in that situation use. There has been unprecedented hostility against people of devout faiths in recent years. So the problem is there. It’s been clearly defined. The president is aware of it.”Kuklowski said there are several routes to securing “religious liberty,” including the “single most important thing,” which is putting constitutional “originalists” on the federal courts and on the Supreme Court. And he said that Donald Trump, who promised he’d put originalists like the late Justice Antonin Scalia on the high court, “is keeping that promise” as president with the nomination of Neil Gorsuch, who is also an originalist.In terms of “administrative actions” such as an executive order, Kuklowski said there are “various types of actions” that Trump could take, and he referred to “federal law and federal programs” that the president could affect. (He acknowledged that state laws protecting LGBTQ people could only be overturned via the “federal judiciary,” again stressing the importance of putting originalists on the federal courts.)“And I’m confident,” he continued, “that the president is showing ― much to the shock of many establishment people who said, ‘There’s no way this’ll happen’ ― that he keeps his promises, even when they’re things that an establishment player would never do. And I’m confident that he’s going to keep his promise when it comes to protection of religious liberty as well.” Follow Michelangelo Signorile on Twitter: www.twitter.com/msignorile"

Let’s have the investigation and find out the truth.”Pelosi was referring to recent reports about the Trump White House enlisting intelligence officials and key lawmakers, like House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) ― the lawmaker who would normally hold a congressional investigation into this matter ― to counter the narrative about Russian interference and inappropriate ties to the Trump campaign.Republicans have repeatedly deferred questions about Russia and Trump to the intelligence committees in Congress and the Department of Justice.But considering Sessions’ role in the Trump campaign, Pelosi and other Democrats want a special, independent investigation outside of the DOJ. And given Nunes’ ties to the campaign, as well as his apparent willingness to take direction from the White House, congressional Democrats are doubting the ability of their Republican counterparts to seriously look into the matter.DOJ ethics guidelines prohibit employees from being involved in investigations in which they have a “personal or political relationship with any person or organization substantially involved in the conduct that is subject of the investigation or prosecution, or who would be directly affected by the outcome.”Responding to questions about how appropriate it would be for someone like Sessions, who was so involved in the Trump campaign, to oversee an investigation into the Trump campaign, White House deputy press secretary Sarah Sanders said Congress had the power to investigate these questions, and any probe into Trump and Russia would start with Congress and the intelligence committees.“We’re extremely confident that whatever review, they’re all going to come to the same conclusion that we had no involvement in this,” Sanders said.But, again, Nunes himself is looking incapable of an impartial investigation, and Democrats believe the matter rises above a normal congressional inquiry.Pelosi noted that there are now more than 100 Democrats ― “plus one Republican” (Walter Jones of North Carolina) ― calling for an outside commission into Trump’s “personal, political, and financial” ties to Russia, and she renewed her call for Congress to pass a bill establishing that investigation."

During the Cleveland administration in the late 1890s, one reporter became known for waiting outside the gates of the White House to ask those coming and going about their business inside the White House. At the turn of the 20th century, President McKinley gave reporters a table in a second floor hallway to work from, and his secretary started the ongoing (and evidently endangered) tradition of regularly briefing the press on the President's activities. The first designated office for the press came under Teddy Roosevelt.Teddy Roosevelt's administration is the first under which ""White House Correspondent"" became a real, respected line of work, and it's when most of the major dailies opened their first Washington bureaus. It is also at this time that the Press Room first appeared--a permanent location strategically located close to the president and his staff. Still, Roosevelt didn't entirely grasp their importance, and he largely used the reporters sent to cover him to shape his public image and he denied access to those who didn't report as he wanted them to (sound familiar?).Starting with World War I, regular briefings of the press became commonplace--after all, there was a lot going on, regularly, and the press needed to know about it. President Truman altered these briefings to be more orderly and less chaotic, introducing a lot of the customs that are still followed in briefings today (or, at least, they were before the current administration showed up and turned the entire thing on its head). President Eisenhower was the first to allow television recording of his news conferences, forever changing the way we report on the president and providing unprecedented public access and transparency. By the 21st century, the press room had been improved and expanded, (seemingly) permanently acknowledging the centrality of the media in a presidential administration.So why does the White House Press Corps matter? Because we need eyes and ears on the President and his staff. We need to know what the President does with his time, what the people working for him do--who they meet with, what they say. The access that the press has to the President and other members of the government is both ethically and morally requisite. However, this access is *not* legally guaranteed. It has been pushed for and somewhat reluctantly granted over more than a century. It is precious and quintessentially democratic. But the first amendment does not protect the press from being barred from the White House Press Room.First, here's what the amendment says:""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.""What does this mean? The clause referencing the press is meant to ensure that no laws are passed that impinge on the ability of the press to do its job, to cover events as they happen, and write about them as they deem appropriate. Later SCOTUS decisions on issues of free press have clarified violations of the free press, including prior restraint, and they have made it difficult to sue the press when they make honest mistakes. But what the clause does NOT do is establish a legal requirement that the press be able to access anyone and anything it wants, not even elected officials.That being said: denying access, as the administration did yesterday, may not be illegal, may not be unconstitutional, but it is undeniably wrong and we must combat it vigorously. In fact, the very legality of it makes it that much more important that we be aware, engaged, vigilant, and active in demanding access for journalists. We cannot sit back and wait for a legal system to force this administration to allow these reputable journalists back into the White House Press Room--we have to make it happen ourselves. No court will step in and require that the New York Times be allowed into Spicer's briefings. There is no law enforcement that will fix this problem for us. We must follow the example of each brave reporter that pushed for access to the people's house--the people's president--and demand the kind of transparency that only proximity can grant us. Our republic depends on it.This post originally appeared on the author’s website. It is part of her ongoing series entitled Resources for the Resistance and can be accessed here."

For someone aiming to be an actor, a field where a distinctive look matters, that may not sound promising. Paxton turned it into an asset, parlaying a familiar exterior into dozens of movie and television characters who ranged from the father of Texas to a calculating polygamist to a loud cynical cop. As far as the world knew, Paxton was still right in the middle of playing that cop – Frank Roarke on the new CBS series Training Day – when it was announced that he had died Saturday, age 61, after “complications from surgery.”His death stunned the movie and TV communities, where he had been a popular presence for more than 30 years. Colleagues from Tom Hanks, Rob Lowe, Jamie Lee Curtis and Elijah Wood to Aaron Paul and Charlize Theron tweeted reverent goodbyes while director James Cameron, who cast Paxton in films like Titanic, remembered their taking a submarine down to the ship’s actual wreckage. On television Paxton was best known for his six years as Bill Henrickson on HBO’s Big Love, a drama about an extended polygamist family in which Bill had three “sister wives.”Paxton played Henrickson in many ways as your average American husband and father, partly because Bill often saw himself that way.The polygamy part, however, along with the number of soapish dramas inevitable in any large family, forced him into a continuous juggling act.He used his everyman face to great advantage in that role, never letting adversaries or the outside world see any of the fault lines in his life.He needed a different kind of artful dodging as Randolph McCoy, patriarch of the McCoy clan in the History miniseries Hatfields & McCoys. He received his only Emmy nomination for that role, following three Golden Globe nominations for his work in Big Love.One of his most straightforward characters, he said in a 2015 interview, was Sam Houston in the History series Texas Rising.“Houston was bigger than life,” said Paxton, himself a native of Texas. “He should be more of a central figure in history than he is. It’s fun to play a man like that.”He was particularly happy to work on a show with dramatic roots in classic Westerns, he said, “because Westerns tell so much of the American story. Growing up, we all watched John Wayne. We still look to characters like we saw in High Noon or Shane.”Heroic as Sam Houston often was, Paxton’s Frank Roarke on the surface sat near the other end of the scale.But his Roarke is more elusive than that. He’s a cop who long ago stopped following the rules, and got away with it because his unorthodox methods landed some big fish.In the 2001 Training Day movie, that character was past redemption. As he’s written and Paxton plays him in the TV series, there’s a subtle shift suggesting Roarke might still harbor vestiges of faith under a hard-boiled exterior.It’s a contrast that, again, Paxton was well-suited to play, since he had so often used his neutral appearance to keep viewers uncertain whether he’d be good or bad, normal or nuts, serious or sarcastic.He could play them all. He could sneak up on us. He proved that, sometimes, the guy next door could end up commanding the room."

Candidate Donald Trump contrasted himself with other Republicans, and aligned himself with the overwhelming majority of the American people, by opposing all cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. But it's far from certain that President Donald Trump will keep his campaign promise. Only days after Trump's election, House Speaker Paul Ryan announced plans to destroy Medicare and instead give seniors an insufficient ""voucher"" to purchase insurance on the private market. Even though 55 and 60 year olds often can't purchase affordable insurance since they're too ""expensive"" to be profitable for the corporations, Ryan thinks putting 90 year olds on the private marketplace is a great idea. Trump hasn't said a word (or tweet) in protest of Ryan's horrific plans. Instead, he appointed Ryan's House colleagues and close allies Tom Price and Mick Mulvaney to key cabinet posts. Both men have a long record of working to destroy Medicare and Medicaid. We are going to keep putting pressure on Trump to keep the promises he's made to the American people, and if the Ryan plan makes his approval ratings plunge even lower than they already are, maybe he will. But it's clear that he can't be trusted. Medicare and Medicaid need another line of defense. That's why we've launched the Hands Off Medicare and Medicaid Tour around the country. The goal of the tour is to find three Republican Senators to vote against any reconciliation bill that cuts Medicare or Medicaid. Ryan has already made it clear that he plans to jam through his plan to gut Medicare and Medicaid using reconciliation—a process that Democrats can’t filibuster—meaning it only requires a simple majority. There are currently 52 Republican Senators. So three Republicans are needed to defeat these attacks on our Medicare and Medicaid. This may be an uphill fight, but a winnable one - it's already clear that Ryan's plans are far less popular with Senate Republicans than they are in the House. Sen. Murkowski (R-AK) recently said she will almost certainly not vote to destroy Medicaid. The Hands off Medicare and Medicaid tour is headlined by Jon Bauman, best known as “Bowzer” from the hit TV series and musical group Sha Na Na. We started in Maine at a packed house in Lewiston, ME followed by another packed house in Portland, ME. One gentleman snowshoed through the snowstorm to get there! At both of the stops, crowds of seniors made calls to Sen. Susan Collins’ (R-ME) office to demand she pledge to vote no on any reconciliation bill that includes Medicare or Medicaid. We visited Sen. Collins’ Portland office alongside her constituents to make sure Collins’ office heard directly from her bosses. We have partnered with organized groups on the ground in Maine as well as our key activists to keep the phone calls and office visits rolling in. This month, we traveled to Arizona and teamed up with a group of fantastic retired teachers from the Arizona Education Association, the Alliance for Retired Americans and local seniors and activists for stops in Phoenix and Tucson. We had massive turnout of activists preparing to send a clear and unrelenting message to Senators John McCain and Jeff Flake (both R-AZ): Hands off Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security! We heard dozens of stories from people who would be impacted directly by the destruction of Medicaid and Medicare and we joined them to visit McCain’s Phoenix and Flake’s Tucson offices. This is only the beginning. We are going to keep traveling all around the country, speaking to rooms filled with citizen activists, and spreading our message, including in song: “Bom-ba-ba-bom-ba-bom-ba-bom-bom, Hands off Medicare!”Sign our petition to Senate Republicans demanding they pledge to vote no on any reconciliation bill that includes Medicare or Medicaid.

I’m also writing to all the rainbow kids, whatever you call yourselves",2017-02-26,"<p><em>Charlie’s 11th birthday party, receiving a “twin” shirt from a great friend.</em></p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b21bcd2900005b00beaeac.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Dear Trans Kids,I’m writing to you, but not just to you. I’m also writing to all the rainbow kids, whatever you call yourselves, however you identify. I am writing to you as an American-born, white, straight, cisgender, liberal Christian mother of three with a good education, a good job, three good kids, and a good husband. What do I have to offer you? My unconditional love and my unwavering support in a battle for your rights ― a battle that with “45” in office is only just beginning.You don’t know me, but I’ve been advocating for you for the past nine years.My youngest child is a boy who identifies as gender creative. I read some of my writing about the moment I knew he was “different” here.I am an advocate for the LGBTQ+ community, and specifically for gender non-conforming/gender creative and transgender kids. I founded and run a playgroup for transgender and gender creative kids, and discussion group for parents. I contact my local representatives. I write and speak out whenever I can. I love opportunities to educate.Officially, the term gender creative is an adjective, coined by the brilliant author, and developmental & clinical psychologist, Diane Ehrensaft, Ph.D. It simply means: People (often children) who don’t conform to traditional or stereotypical gender norms; a developmental position in which the child transcends the culture’s normative definitions of male/female to creatively interweave a sense of gender that come neither totally from the inside (the body, the psyche), nor totally from the outside (culture, others’ perceptions), but resides somewhere in between. Sometimes they are referred to as gender non-conforming.My first two pieces published last summer on Huffington Post were When Your Fourth Grade Son is Called Gay, and then, Why I Refuse to Apologize for My Son Wearing a Dress. Then I published an open letter on my blog that I wrote to Justice, the tween girls clothing store, for welcoming my then 10-year-old son to shop in their store, use the “girls” dressing rooms, and for making the experience seamless and natural in a very tense environment post North Carolina’s notorious anti-LGBTQ+ law, HB2. That letter went viral overnight, garnering over 22,000 shares by morning, and 48,000 shares by afternoon, something I was neither expecting nor prepared for.When I wrote those blog posts, I was speaking out on behalf of my son, but also, on behalf of all the gender creative, gender variant, gender non-conforming children I knew had to be out there.For lack of better terminology back then, I remember both “effeminate” boys and “butch” girls from my own childhood ― as early as elementary school. They were teased and harassed mercilessly. By middle school it only got worse. They were plagued with names such as “faggot,” “gay,” “pansy,” “dyke,” “lesbo,” and more, regardless of whether or not they were sexually identifying yet. It was just about the worst label to have attached to you if you were of my generation, especially during the early-mid ‘80s when the AIDS crisis hit, when ignorance and paranoia fueled our sex culture.Regardless of whether these kids were actually on, or grew to identify as part of the LGBTQ+ spectrum or not, they were more often than not gender non-conforming. The ones who weren’t were usually pretending. Pretending to be cisgender. Or straight. Those are probably the top two things that are somewhat easier to fake than other outward appearances.I had several brave gay friends who came out in the ‘80s. For a few of them, it was both a huge relief and disastrous. Family relationships were torn apart. Friendships were lost. Some of them were kicked out of their homes because their parents refused to have someone gay living under their roof. But the relief that came with no longer having to pretend to be straight was well worth their mental health for the rest of their lives.Though the pieces I’ve written and spoken about were not about gay people, but rather transgender and gender creative people, they seem oddly more relevant today than they did when I first began writing them nine years ago. By the tender age of 2 1/2, my youngest child said to me, “Mommy, you know I’m only a boy because of my parts, right?” I didn’t know anything about transgender people back then, let alone that I’d one day need to fight for these people’s basic human rights.I cued in and listened to my young son. I knew this was a profound statement from such a small child, and I knew it wasn’t nonsense. It also aligned perfectly well with his toy and play preferences. Never one to show any interest in rough & tumble play, or trucks and cars, my son instead favored princess dress up, Barbies, and gentle, imaginative play. I began reading and researching as much as I could about “effeminate” boys. Eventually I happened upon Lori Duron’s blog, Raising My Rainbow, and the heavens opened up and angels proclaimed hallelujah. Finally, I found a resource. Her family was on the opposite coast of the United States from me, but her child was close in age to mine, and someone with whom I could identify. I was not alone, nor was my child.As the years passed, I decided to try something that I never saw other moms doing. I decided to let my son be; to not try and change him. By playing with stereotypical “girls” stuff, he wasn’t hurting anyone. There was no harm. This is just who he was, plain and simple.I had a couple of mom friends with young boys who liked to play dolls and princess dress up with my son. They were fine with it until about age 4, when the moms didn’t find it so cute anymore. Which I always considered silly. These boys were 4 and 5. They were engaging in natural play. “At the very ‘worst,’” I thought, “these kids are learning how to be gentle, loving, present fathers.” But the other two moms didn’t agree. They felt that allowing these boys to express a more feminine side would lead to their “becoming gay,” or lead them to be bully bait. One parent went so far as to throw away all her daughter’s used ballet costumes in an effort to dissuade her younger son from dressing up in them anymore. He was devastated and cried over this loss. His father yelled at him, told him to “man up,” and quickly replaced his beloved hand-me-down ballet costumes with footballs and army gear.I wanted to go a different route. I decided I would never shame my son for who he was. After several years, it was obvious that he was more feminine than masculine to both my husband and me. We knew that the majority of society would not embrace that. And we did do our due diligence in buying him plenty of “boys” stuff. But he was never interested. We also felt that if we shamed him into the closet, the long-term damage to his life would be much worse than if he had to endure some short term, kid-type teasing or bullying. Kids all seem to be picked on for something or another. And even if our child tried to “man up,” he just wasn’t able to hide the feminine tendencies. He was fragile and tiny with delicate features, very much unlike his older brother who was solid, robust, and hyper-masculine.We decided that he would grow up encouraged to be himself, knowing that he was loved unconditionally. He would not just be accepted, but celebrated, just as he was, and however that changed over time.Over the past year, I have taken every opportunity to write about, or speak out against discrimination of marginalized people. I recently had a male acquaintance of my son approach me and say, “Um, I’m not trying to be rude, but, your son is wearing a pink flower headpiece in his hair.”“Yes,” I replied with a smile. He’s growing his hair out long and that headband is one of his favorites. It keeps his hair out of his eyes.”“But,” the child continued, “I just think it’s... um... it’s...um... it’s just... WEIRD.”He said “weird” with that look on his face that implied not curiosity, but disgust.I replied, “Actually, I think the word you’re looking for is not weird, but brave.”He looked confused.I continued, “do you have any idea how brave a 5th grade boy has to be to wear pink flowers in his hair and be taken seriously? Do you have any idea how brave a 5th grade boy has to be to wear a headpiece in his hair with huge pink flowers and come to school knowing that he will be teased and picked on by just about everyone? And yet he wears it anyway because he likes it and that’s all that matters. That is nothing short of being extremely brave. Young man, let me ask you: are you brave enough to come to school wearing pink flowers in your hair?”The response of crickets let me know my point was well-understood.I try to find these moments in every day life and educate others, or at least help them see a different viewpoint.My son just celebrated his 11th birthday this week. It wasn’t much of a celebration, because a bad case of pneumonia has taken him down for about a week so far. But still he managed to make an appearance at his birthday party which consisted predominantly of 5th grade girls. It was actually the first birthday party where his friends gifted him all the “girly” stuff that he asked for. My Little Pony plushies. A tiara. Pink slippers. A shirt that reads All Kinds of Fabulous. Another floral headband for his growing hair. A “twin” shirt from a good female friend so that they can be twins at school on the same day.He’s still young, but he has the courage and confidence to be himself regardless of the teasing that inevitably occurs. This puts him light speed ahead of other gender diverse kids who are not allowed to explore this side of themselves until adulthood ― and by then, they’ve spent most of their formative years living a lie. I know many of these people. The majority of them are prone to self-destruction in adulthood. Sadly, some of them have committed suicide. I’ve received multitudes of e-mails from transgender and gender diverse adults who have told me their stories, and how much better they believe they would’ve fared in the real world if only their parents had been accepting of their true self, if only they had learned during their youth to build self-confidence instead of building walls or learning hiding techniques.My son may reveal to me that he’s transgender. He may reveal that he is gender creative forever. He may be agender. Eventually he may reveal that he’s gay, bi, or asexual. He may settle into being cisgender (though it hasn’t looked that way for pretty much ever.) Regardless of the outcome, he knows he is loved and accepted and celebrated for exactly who he is.To all the trans kids, and all the rainbow kids, no matter how you identify, I want you to know that you are seen, you are heard, and you are worth celebrating. This hateful, ignorant, divisive, destructive administration will be gone soon enough. You will be around much longer, and it’s not worth it to hide. Do what you can to be brave, be yourself, be strong. I’m just one small advocate. You may have no idea, but there are armies of us out there, and we will spend the rest of our lives fighting for your right to live authentically.Originally published at www.gendercreativelife.com "

Invitees, honorees and some Academy Award nominees paraded through the glittering suite with me as top of the line designers made sure everyone departed with gift bags bursting. Brand creators and marketers showered us with goods hoping for one of the great opportunities in the marketing world, a ‘brand identifier’, which is when a celebrity is charmed enough to use a product themselves in their daily life. Creators and marketers talked to stars one on one and shared stories about their product’s origins and mission statements. It all went down at the SLS Hotel in Beverly Hills, hosted by Secret Room Events who organize gifting suites for every major event in Hollywood.There were fascinating things to see and fascinating people to meet. Doris Morgado who stars as ‘Marie’ in the new Wolverine movie “Logan”, starring Hugh Jackman (which just premiered at the Berlin Film Festival this month), as well as working with Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg in “2 Guns”. She was holding several bags filled with goodies from the glittering suite.We were both taken with Allowmind’s sleek sunglass-looking optics, a lightweight black eyewear - surprisingly lightweight - that immerses you in the feel of an enormous movie theater screen when you put them on. The HD image was crystal clear and with earphones on it was a completely immersive experience. Pretty impressive given I was momentarily able to forget that I was in a particularly loud and busy gifting suite. Look for the Allomind product to debut this year.Laura Wiggens, who stars in 20th Century Woman which is nominated this evening for an Oscar for best screenplay tonight, is also known for her work in the Showtime series “Shameless”. Also look for her in the upcoming “Rings”, the sequel to the iconic horror movie hit “The Ring”. Laura was very impressed with Dermesse, a product line 30 years in business - who do private label for very high-end brands - started their own 13 years ago. They do the pharmaceutical grade for dermatologists and plastic surgeons, and decided to do their own version available over the counter. Dermatesse is the same formulation for over the counter.Steve Glickman, the voice of the villain Pigeon Toady in the animated feature “Storks” last year, was speaking very highly of Director Nicholas Stoller and co-star Kelsey Grammer. “When you meet one of your idols, and they’re nicer on the set than you had hoped, it’s one of the best feelings,” he said. He was taken with the Eterna Bella skin product line, designed in Japan, which prides itself on using natural ingredients and no harsh chemicals.Nominated for an Academy Award tonight, short subject film maker, Juanjo Giménez, director of “Time Code”, is from Barcelona and was a little overwhelmed. “I’ve never seen anything like this,” the director shared with me. A reminder that hard core guerrilla film makers often have to beg for every dollar of their budget to see their dreams come true on the screen and must feel like they’ve crossed through the looking glass when they are handed hundreds of items for free at the gifting suites.Gabrielle Dennis, who stars in Fox TV’s “Rosewood” as Pippy Rosewood was very taken with Catiques – a jewelry designer who recycles and re-purposes products to make unique artistic jewelry that is beautiful.Screenwriter Ray Gideon, who penned such hits as “Stand By Me”, “Starman” and “Mr. Brooks” was very taken with Julie’s Own, a natural nut butter spread made by the creators, Julie and Michael Fox. They started their product in 2015 after choosing to switch their diet paleo because of a life-threatening diagnosis Micheal had. Julie made the product for him and her home made nut butter was so healthy, and so good, he decided more people should benefit from it. They use all natural ingredients, whole almond and cashews, not pieces, which many other manufacturers do. They have a huge following from the golf community and feed team USA.Keena Ferguson, on Fox TV’s “Atlanta”, as well as the voice of Jedi Master Ranos in the new Star Wars computer game, was another fan of Julie’s nut butter. Jillian Reeves – who premiered last night in the TV movie “Media” was a big fan of Wen Beauty products by Chaz Dean. They have a full line of natural hair care products, with all natural ingredients and have branched out into perfume and cologne market as well. I tried the ‘Light’ for men, and think it’s a keeper.Cocoa Brown, currently starring in “Dying Laughing” with Chris Rock and Jerry Seinfeld, loved the Vivajennz, a beverage purse carrier invented by Jennifer Thomas Geiring. A great idea! Mom’s can travel with liquids in style, and single girls can travel with whatever cocktails they like!Jennifer has an amazing story, an anesthesiologist by day, inventor by night. Her son, who’s autistic, prefers certain colors and flavors of drinks. So when she was on the go with him she cleverly designed this bag. To her surprise, it took off as a big hit when girlfriends cottoned onto it for their more extracurricular activities. Who doesn’t want to carry a little hooch in style?There were many more things to see, Artphere, the high fashion briefcase backpacks, from Japanese designer Keiichi Rosense, whose design work is known in the fashion world, and now branching out giving the opportunity to own art in real life applications.Dorey Aromatherapy, formulated by Mary Ellen Dorey personally with a full line of well care , body care and skin care using the highest quality of organic and wild crafted essential oils. I sampled some and found it quite efficacious!Taaseen Qureshi and Davina Potratz were representing Cavalleri Malibu, with 2 and 3 bedroom condos available from only $1.2M; nice digs! For those of you from out of town, for a condo in Malibu, I’ll tell you that’s actually a reasonable price.Many more fascinating products included: SleekHair.com, who have 30,000 products in their catalogue, many rare, niche and specialty items. They had a big booth and were doing makeovers for the trendy and the hip. StinkBOSS, invented by a busy mom who figured that putting her kids’ shoes and gear in a box and hitting it with ozone killed bacteria, and the smell, and could do the same for you! Auspect Skin Care was there with their full line Australian skin rejuvenation system, their products are terrific which I’ve written about before. Spoiled Naturally lotion bar, Slice of Life organics gummy bear vitamins, Imedeen skin rejuvenation products, Leuchtturm1917 notebooks, Gotlieb Nature Garden Conservatory and Guylien chocolates!The swag haul was abundant as in any secret room event!"

And, aall of this as 69 hate-incidents targeting 54 Jewish Community Centers in 27 states.America. 2017.In Jewish tradition, we care for our loved ones when they die, carefully preparing their bodies, burying them with dignity, and ritually memorializing them through time. This is called “Chesed Shel Emet,” and act of true love, understood as such because the actions we take have no hope of being repaid. One day, others will care for us as we care for those we have lost.But we need not wait for the healing to begin. In this last week, Muslim Americans have joined their Jewish sisters and brothers, raising funds to repair the cemeteries. and, after a Tampa mosque was targeted by arson this week, a communal interfaith response brought Jewish, Muslims, and Christians together in a powerful vigil.(Just imagine the good we could do for and with each other if the latent flames of American hatred weren’t being enabled ― if not stoked ― by the current administration. There are no bystanders to hatred. To stand by an attack on my sister or brother is to be complicit in the act of hate.)Judaism has deep wisdom to offer the world, hard-earned wisdom every Jewish generation commits to learning from their ancestors’ experiences. This is, of course, not exclusively Jewish. Faith traditions and the beautiful institutions of American historical consciousness are all modeled on that very idea: learn from the past to avoid the big mistakes of previous generations. (Just imagine the lessons our descendants will learn from today’s growing American chaos.)And, friends, if you are deeply concerned for your own tribal American sub-community, and not (yet) moved to action by attacks on others (ie, Muslims, immigrants, LGBTQ people, journalists, disabled Americans, women) remember this:Jews have learned the costs of silence, the price of “just going along.” We have seen this before, and we will not abide. Not now, not here. There is no room for hate, and Jews have learned throughout our ravaged history that if society allows verbal and physical attacks on the dead, on neighbors, it is only a matter of time before that hate comes with its scaly hands on your door.Perhaps, in these dark American days, peppered by growing hatred and mistrust, festering uber-nationalism in the White House senior staff, most purely embodied in our crude and mean-spirited president’s conduct, we can do something novel: let’s return to a truer American greatness than the cruel isolationism being promulgated today.Love each other harder and faster than the hate can spread.Show up as kind Americans.Let our better angels out.Show up.Build on Love."
55,HEALTHY LIVING,9 Traps You Fall Into That Limit Your Happiness,"Dr. Travis Bradberry, ContributorTalentSmart, President and 'Emotional Intelligence 2.0,' Coauthor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/9-traps-you-fall-into-that-limit-your-happiness_us_58af4dbce4b02f3f81e44545,Unhappiness can catch you by surprise.,2017-02-26,<p>Research shows that your habits create happiness (and unhappiness) more than anything else in life. Don’t let these bad habits drag you down. </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58af4ed42900002b00bea870.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Almost every action we take in life is aimed at achieving or maintaining “happiness”—that elusive state where we feel contentment, satisfaction, and even bliss.Still, happiness can be a bit hard to define. Unhappiness, on the other hand, is easy to identify; you know it when you see it, and you definitely know when it’s taken ahold of you.Happiness has much less to do with life circumstances than you might think. A University of Illinois study found that people who earn the most (more than $10 million annually) are only a smidge happier than the average Joes and Janes who work for them.Life circumstances have little to do with happiness because much happiness is under your control—the product of your habits and your outlook on life. Psychologists from the University of California who study happiness found that genetics and life circumstances only account for about 50% of a person’s happiness. The rest is up to you.Unhappiness can catch you by surprise. So much of your happiness is determined by your habits (in thought and deed) that you have to monitor them closely to make certain that bad habits don’t drag you down into the abyss.Some habits lead to unhappiness more than others do. These traps are easily avoided once you’re aware of them.1. Holding your feelings in. One of the great misconceptions concerning emotional intelligence (EQ) is that it is about repressing our feelings and holding them in. While it is true there are feelings that high EQ individuals do not allow to erupt on impulse, that does not mean those feelings are not expressed. Emotional intelligence means honoring your feelings and allowing yourself to experience the catharsis that comes from embracing them for what they are. Only then can you express them in a manner that helps rather than hinders your ability to reach your goals.2. Numbing yourself with technology. Everyone deserves the opportunity to binge-watch a TV show now and then or to switch on your Kindle and get lost in a book. The real question is how much time you spend plugged in (to video games, the TV, the tablet, the computer, the phone, etc.) and whether it makes you feel good or simply makes you numb. When your escape becomes a constant source of distraction, it is a sure sign you have fallen into the trap of too much of a good thing.3. Spending too much time and effort acquiring “things.” People living in extreme poverty experience a significant increase in happiness when their financial circumstances improve, but it drops off quickly above $20,000 in annual income. There’s an ocean of research that shows that material things don’t make you happy. When you make a habit of chasing things, you are likely to become unhappy because, beyond the disappointment you experience once you get them, you discover that you’ve gained them at the expense of the real things that can make you happy, such as friends, family, and hobbies.4. Waiting for the future. Telling yourself, “I’ll be happy when …” is one of the easiest unhappy habits to fall into. How you end the statement doesn’t really matter (it might be a promotion, more pay, or a new relationship) because it puts too much emphasis on circumstances, and improved circumstances don’t lead to happiness. Don’t spend your time waiting for something that’s proven to have no effect on your mood. Instead focus on being happy right now, in the present moment, because there’s no guarantee of the future.5. Fighting change. Change is an inevitable part of life, and those who fight it do so because they are struggling to remain in control. The problem with this approach is that fighting change actually limits your control over the situation by putting up a barrier between yourself and the actions you need to take to improve your situation.The idea here is to prepare for change. This is not a guessing game where you test your accuracy in anticipating what comes next, but rather it means thinking through the consequences of potential changes so that you are not caught off guard if they surface. The first step is to admit that even the most stable and trusted facets of your life are not completely under your control. People change, businesses go through ebbs and flows, and things simply do not stay the same for long. When you allow yourself to anticipate change—and understand your options if changes occur—you prevent yourself from getting bogged down by strong emotions like shock, surprise, fear, and disappointment when changes actually happen. While you are still likely to experience these negative emotions, your acceptance that change is an inevitable part of life enables y to focus and think rationally, which is critical to making the most out of an unlikely, unwanted, or otherwise unforeseen situation.6. Pessimism. Nothing fuels unhappiness quite like pessimism. The problem with a pessimistic attitude, beyond it being hard on your mood, is that it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy: if you expect bad things, you’re more likely to get bad things. Pessimistic thoughts are hard to shake off until you recognize how illogical they are. Force yourself to look at the facts, and you’ll see that things are not nearly as bad as they seem.7. Trying to keep up with the Joneses. Jealousy and envy are incompatible with happiness, so if you’re constantly comparing yourself with others, it’s time to stop. In one study, most subjects said that they’d be okay with making less money, but only if everybody else did too. Be wary of this kind of thinking as it won’t make you happy and, more often than not, has the opposite effect.8. Not improving. Because unhappy people are pessimists and feel a lack of control over their lives, they tend to sit back and wait for life to happen to them. Instead of setting goals, learning, and improving themselves, they just keep plodding along, and then they wonder why things never change. Don’t let this be you.9. Staying home. When you feel unhappy, it’s tempting to avoid other people. This is a huge mistake as socializing, even when you don’t enjoy it, is great for your mood. We all have those days when we just want to pull the covers over our heads and refuse to talk to anybody, but understand that the moment this becomes a tendency, it destroys your mood. Recognize when unhappiness is making you antisocial, force yourself to get out there and mingle, and you’ll notice the difference right away.Bringing It All TogetherChanging your habits in the name of greater happiness is one of the best things that you can do for yourself.

Health Minister Subramaniam Sathasivam revealed that Kim Jong Nam, the estranged half brother of the North Korean leader, began showing symptoms within minutes after two women wiped a poisonous liquid on his face at Kuala Lumpur’s airport on Feb. 13. He fainted in the airport clinic and died in the ambulance traveling to a hospital.“It did it so fast and all over the body, so it affected the heart, it affected the lungs, it affected everything,” Subramaniam told reporters at a press conference Sunday. “I would think it was about, from the time of onset, from the time of application, 15-20 minutes,” he estimated, according to The Associated Press.Malaysian authorities confirmed Friday that the poison used in the attack was VX nerve agent, an incredibly deadly and rarely seen chemical classified by the United Nations as a weapon of mass destruction.“This is one of those agents that absorbs well through the skin,” Subramaniam said Sunday.Malaysia has not implicated North Korea in the attack, and the hermit kingdom has denied any involvement. However, Malaysian officials say four North Korean men provided the poison to the two women, one of whom was from Indonesia and one of whom was from Vietnam. The men fled Malaysia the day of the attack, and the women were arrested."

She pleaded no contest and was immediately sentenced.Wilkins was driving drunk when she struck 31-year-old Phillip Moreno as he was crossing a street in Torrance, California, at night, the Los Angeles Times reported.Moreno was allegedly facedown and embedded into the windshield and hood of Wilkins’ car. Police said Wilkins panicked and kept driving until other people stopped her car and took away her keys.Moreno had a pulse when officers arrived, but was later pronounced dead at a local hospital. Wilkins told police she was heading home from work as a substance-abuse counselor at the Twin Town Treatment Center, but the center denies that she had worked that night, according to the Times.Wilkins said she drank three vodka shots and a beer in her car before she started driving. Investigators said her blood-alcohol level was nearly twice the legal limit 90 minutes after the crash, but the defense argued that not enough time had passed for her blood-alcohol level to exceed the legal limit of .08.Wilkins was originally found guilty in 2014 on similar charges arising from the same incident and sentenced to 55 years to life in prison. That conviction was later overturned by an appeals court on the grounds that her entire criminal history, which included drug abuse, had been admitted at trial and could have prejudiced the jury, according to the Daily Breeze."

It made us sick you know. First you hunger for the taste of a stranger, then your enemy, then anyone called a leader, then any small difference will do. Your hands become sharp and your words become sharp and the only move available, even with beloveds, is bloodletting. What we called justice back then was the death throes of a worldview, of divine monarchy, manifest destiny, supremacy. It is dying still, but now we have contained the death within ourselves. Inside, in the gardens where we “grow our souls,” in that soil, we are composting the final strains of this disease.When we define ourselves, the result is complexity. We are none of us one thing, neither good nor bad. We are complex surviving organisms. We do appalling things to each other, rooted in trauma. We survive, we learn, we have agency about our next steps.We rise to great kindness, great bravery, rooted in lineage and dream. “If you don’t trust the people, they become untrustworthy.” – Lao Tzu, Tao te ChingWe went through the untrustworthy age. It was hundreds and hundreds of years. Not trusting creates good soil for fear, terror. We were terrified of everyone, everything different than us. Our distrust was contagious, palpable. It seemed like everyone died. It seemed like we wept every day. Then we remembered ourselves, remembered that trust is not earned – it is how we begin. It is the first thing we do. Learning to trust is returning to beginner’s mind, returning to our nature. We are meant to need each other.“We honor our ancestors by thriving.” – Dallas GoldtoothWe realized we didn’t know what we were doing, even the experts. We turned to our personal relationships, to our families, our lovers, our closest friends, and we said to each other, “I want justice between us.”We put down our masks and projections.We began speaking to each other only truth. We found a center within ourselves and began to listen there.We cultivated curiosity.Enough of us were in practice to be able to say the word community and mean it, not aesthetically, not based in shared oppression, but in our visionary practices of justice rooted in love, in connection.We began to question our own actions, our participation in systems designed around our subjugation. We relinquished judgment rooted in superiority. We shook off individual righteousness as a symptom of supremacy thinking. We were not better than each other. We worked together to generate ways forward.We outgrew the survival technology of politeness-in-the-face-of-injustice, which had gotten us as far as it could get us, the presidency of nations. It could not get us to liberation, so we adapted.Not all of us could be in one place, so we made room – room for many ways of being.We learned to place our attention where we wanted it. When someone acted against community, instead of flooding them with our attention, we pulled collective attention away from them, while a healer would move in and give attention to that someone’s root system, supporting wholeness. We learned what forgiveness lets us release, and how to use time to heal that which feels too painful to forgive.We turned to look back at our traumas and understand how they shaped us. We created more room for the traumas of other people, for the weight of ancestral trauma. We practiced deep patience with each other.We created boundaries around our joy, around our love, around our children. Only offers of love could be felt, seen, heard, inhaled and tasted. We accepted more and more pathways to change as not only legitimate but necessary.“You’re nobody until you’re somebody to a bunch of other somebodies.” – Jimmy BoggsWe surrendered to how deeply we need each other. All of us matter, to ourselves, to each other.This post is part of the Black Futures Month blog series brought to you by The Huffington Post and the Black Lives Matter Network.

59,POLITICS,How Opponents Sank A GOP Bill To Sell Off Federal Land — And What They Learned,Chris D'Angelo,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/public-lands-battle-chaffetz_us_58a735a8e4b037d17d2778f4,"Rep. Jason Chaffetz just ""kicked a hornet's nest,"" one conservationist said.",2017-02-26,"Jason Chaffetz, the chair of the House Oversight Committee, has shown little backbone in his dealings with the Trump administration.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58aef48b2900002200bea716.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — Perhaps it was lingering outrage from the election. Or it could have been the explicit language of the bill, which called for the “disposal” of millions of acres of “excess” federal lands.Whatever the driving force, the backlash to legislation from Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) that would have sold off 3.3 million acres of public land in 10 Western states was swift and fierce. Outrage erupted on Facebook and Twitter, advocacy groups urged supporters to bombard their congressional representatives’ phone lines, and a petition opposing the sale or transfer of public lands drew tens of thousands of signatures. Less than two weeks after introducing the controversial bill, Chaffetz pulled it, citing concerns from his constituents. Advocates fighting to protect public lands celebrated it as a victory.“The first takeaway is that the squeaky wheel still gets the grease,” said Land Tawney, the president and CEO of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, a Montana-based nonprofit dedicated to protecting public lands and preserving America’s tradition of hunting and fishing.That Chaffetz could be swayed on this issue is notable. The chair of the House Oversight Committee has shown little backbone in his dealings with the Trump administration, opting not to pursue an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn’s ties to Russia. Nor has he seemed to care much about what his voters think, claiming that paid, out-of-state protesters had infiltrated the crowd of angry constituents at a February town hall. It was hunting and fishing advocates, however, who finally managed to get to Chaffetz. But Tawney and other public land advocates who rallied against his measure recognize that while they won this fight, the war is far from over. And they are prepared to stand firmly against what they view as a threat to national heritage. For Tawny, a fifth-generation Montanan, access to land is as important as the guns he hunts with in the field. “This issue is our second Second Amendment,” Tawney said. “Any attack on public lands is a non-starter for us.”The political battle over federal lands is nothing new. But with President Donald Trump in the White House and Republicans in control of both chambers of Congress, the GOP has a golden opportunity to make its move. On day one of this Congress, Republicans approved a rules change making it easier to sell off large swaths of the more than 640 million acres of land the federal government owns, including national parks. The change fits snugly into the party’s 2016 platform, which called for transferring control of federal lands to states and opening public lands for increased oil and mineral production.Then came Chaffetz’s unambiguous bill to sell off several million acres of land he said had “been deemed to serve no purpose for taxpayers.” Chaffetz had introduced the measure every year since 2010, but this time was different ― he had a unified Republican government and a clear party platform to back him up.The introduction on Jan. 24 provoked outrage from conservationists, hunters, anglers and outdoor enthusiasts, who have labeled Chaffetz an “anti-public lands congressman.” Alan Rowsome, senior government relations director for The Wilderness Society, compared the bill to “driving a locomotive over the American people and our wild natural heritage.” In a Facebook Live video on Jan. 27, titled “Call to Arms #publiclandowner,” Tawney urged anyone and everyone who cares about public lands to “show up in spades and fight” against Chaffetz, to call their own representatives and to recruit others. He also offered a warning for the Utah legislator. “You’ve kicked a hornet’s nest and the army is amassing,” Tawney said in the video. “And I will put my money on the people every single time.” It wasn’t just in Utah, either. On Jan. 30, more than 1,000 people turned out for a pro-public lands rally in Helena, Montana. Two days later, hundreds of demonstrators — Republicans and Democrats — converged on the state capitol in New Mexico.Kayje Booker, state policy director for the Montana Wilderness Association, told HuffPost that the turnout at their rally was double what organizers were expecting. And while the Chaffetz bill was among the talking points, the rally’s main purpose was to demonstrate the level of bipartisan support for public lands protection. “At no point were we like, ‘We’ll have a rally and Chaffetz will pull his bill,’” she laughed. But on Feb. 2, the congressman did just that. In an Instagram post including a photo of Chaffetz dressed in hunting camouflage, he noted that he is a “proud gun owner, hunter and love our public lands.” While defending the bill’s land sales, he acknowledged that “groups I support and care about fear it sends the wrong message.” “I hear you and HR 621 dies tomorrow,” he wrote.It’s not clear whether it was one specific group or the collective outcry that pushed Chaffetz to have a change of heart. But the bill and its subsequent death appear to have given advocates new energy.In an interview with the Outdoor Industry Association, Tania Lown-Hecht, communications director for Outdoor Alliance, another public lands advocacy nonprofit, said the success in defeating Chaffetz’s bill is “a great bellwether.”“It tells us that people are paying good attention to policy right now and they are not afraid to share their voices, often loudly and passionately,” she said.Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), who slammed Chaffetz in a statement on Feb. 1, told HuffPost that Chaffetz’s decision to withdraw the measure just nine days after introducing it came as a shock — a welcome one. What was not surprising, he said, was the public’s volatile reaction to the measure. “A lot of people who maybe didn’t take this threat very seriously in the past suddenly woke up and went, ‘Wow, my national forests that I hunt, jog, camp on — that could go away,’” Heinrich told HuffPost. “I don’t care whether you’re an independent, a Democrat or a Republican, if you live in the West, chances are that’s a big part of your life.”Brad Brooks, the Idaho deputy regional director of The Wilderness Society, echoed that sentiment. People from all walks of life, and from both sides of the aisle, had a visceral reaction to the “bold,” “in-your-face” language, he told HuffPost. And the bill, he said, became a kind of “unifying rallying cry” for protecting public lands.Advocacy groups are now reflecting on their win and turning their focus to other proposals. It’s unlikely Republicans will stop writing bills to sell or transfer federal lands, although they may opt for less brazen, more subtle language in the future.Topping advocacy groups’ current list of targets is HR 622, another Chaffetz measure, which seeks to “terminate the law enforcement functions of the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management” and hand over authority to local departments. Heinrich described that proposed bill as “a gift to poachers and drug runners.”Chaffetz’s office did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.Booker said conservationists now face a new opportunity and challenge: maintaining the current level of engagement and enthusiasm. “The energy is there, the momentum is there,” she told HuffPost. “But then how do you harness that for a series of actions?”Sportsmen are also ready to hold lawmakers accountable, Tawney said.“I don’t think they’ll be fatigued with this issue,” he said.Brooks stressed the importance of remaining vigilant to prevent the privatization of some of America’s most cherished protected areas: “I think that people know we’re not messing around anymore when it comes to anti-public lands bills in Congress.” "

They eat water lily roots and the occasional fish. Dit’s family members have not eaten for days.Last week the United Nations declared that parts of South Sudan are experiencing famine, the first time the world has faced such a catastrophe in six years. Some 5.5 million people, nearly half the population, will not have a reliable source of food by July.The disaster is largely man-made. Oil-rich South Sudan, the world’s youngest nation, plunged into civil war in 2013, after President Salva Kiir fired his deputy Riek Machar. Since then, fighting has fractured the country along ethnic lines, inflation topped 800 percent last year and war and drought have paralyzed agriculture.Dit and her children are among more than 100,000 people that the United Nations says face imminent starvation in the counties of Leer and Mayendit in greater Unity state, which borders Sudan.“The children are sick but what can I do? There are no hospitals near us and we can’t move far from where we are hiding.

Nyaluat Chol, a mother of six, said her family had survived on water lilies and palm fruit for the past year.“We have been running from fighting for a long time.

The 2016 report found a House and Senate deeply divided along party lines on issues such as climate change and environmental protection.The environmental group released its latest scorecard Thursday, documenting the environmental voting records of all members of Congress. Each member is given a score based on their votes, which the group uses as a yardstick to measure a legislator’s commitment to climate action, wildlife conservation, protection of clean air and water, and other environmental and public health issues. The average score for House Republicans last year was just 5 percent, while the average House Democrat scored 94 percent, according to the report. The Republican-led House, under the leadership of Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), “remains the most anti-environmental in history,” LCV said in a statement. The House also earned that the ignominious title in 2015. Tiernan Sittenfeld, LCV’s senior vice president of government affairs, told The Huffington Post in an email Thursday that the legislative body has become increasingly hostile to environmental protection since at least 2010. “The trend began with the Tea Party, Citizens United, and the Koch brothers and has continued for the last several years,” she said. The Senate was similarly divided along party lines on issues pertaining to the environment last year, according to the scorecard. “Under Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the Senate joined the House to attack critical environmental safeguards,” said the group. The average Senate Republican’s score last year was 14 percent, while the average score for Senate Democrats was 95 percent. “In the final year of the Obama administration, the Republican leadership in Congress continued its relentless assault on both bedrock environmental protections and recent progress even as we experienced the hottest year on record ― for the third year in a row ― and world leaders came together on Earth Day to sign the historic climate agreement reached in Paris,” said Sittenfeld.As the scorecard details, Congress considered bills last year that would undermine existing environmental and public health laws such as the Clean Air Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act and the Antiquities Act. There was also legislation to undermine the Clean Power Plan, which regulates greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, and the Clean Water Rule, which strives to protect the nation’s rivers, streams and wetlands from pollution. (President Donald Trump has vowed to neuter both regulations. He is expected to take executive action soon to curtail both policies.) The LCV said the 2016 scorecard is a harbinger of what might be expected from the 115th Congress, which remains under Republican control. The group warned, however, that 2017 might be an even worse year for environmental and climate protection with Trump ― who has called global warming “bullshit” and has threatened to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord ― at the helm. Former President Barack Obama was “the greenest president in our history,” LCV said in its statement on the report. Under his leadership, the federal government put a moratorium on new coal leases on public lands, set limits on methane pollution from oil and gas drilling, and advanced other environmental protections. Obama also vetoed some of the most anti-environmental bills that came out of Congress.“The vast majority of the attacks on public health and the environment in 2016 were rebuffed thanks to President Obama and our allies in the Senate, but with Donald Trump in the White House the threats to the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the lands we cherish have never been greater,” Sittenfeld said."

69,POLITICS,"The DNC Chair Race Is A Proxy Battle, But Nobody Told The People Who Get To Vote On It",Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dnc-chair-race-proxy-battle_us_58b11732e4b060480e0841d1,"Voting members say they care about expertise, not ideology or faction.",2017-02-25,Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) has the support of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in his bid to become Democratic National Committee chair. Many voting DNC members couldn't care less.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b1184d2900002200beada4.jpeg?cache=lxMFWF3uiF&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"ATLANTA ― If you’re just paying attention now to the race to chair the Democratic National Committee, you could be forgiven for thinking it is an election for a much bigger office.The race that has lasted well over three months is finally coming to a close on Saturday. The candidates have participated in more than half a dozen public forums or televised debates.And the two top contenders, Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison and former Labor Secretary Tom Perez, each raised nearly $1 million as of the beginning of the month.The Democrats’ trouncing at the polls in November meant it was likely that the DNC chair race would be more hotly contested than normal.But this year’s contest has also attracted inordinate attention and resources because it is widely viewed as a proxy battle between the Democratic establishment and the party’s progressive wing. Perez, who backed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton during the 2016 primary, has gained more traction among establishment figures. Ellison, a supporter of rival presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), has won the enthusiasm of progressive activists.The trouble for some of Ellison’s supporters in particular is that many of the 442 DNC members eligible to vote in the contest just don’t see it that way.Missouri DNC member Brian Wahby endorsed Perez on Friday because of Perez’s “experience managing large organizations.”“He has a good track record of turning around large organizations and it’s part of what we need,” added Iowa DNC member Andrea Philips in explaining her support for Perez.Wahby endorsed Clinton early on in the primary; Philips caucused for her in Iowa.Philips rejected the idea that the race was anything but a choice between people with nearly identical progressive credentials.“I find it discouraging when experience is considered a negative mark against a person. He’s a progressive fighter,” she said.Indeed, Perez has elicited widespread progressive praise for expanding overtime pay for workers, improving police accountability, and fighting for immigrant rights, among other accomplishments. He has a stellar liberal record. His detractors mainly point to his support for the now-defunct Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement and an unwillingness to prosecute bankers while running the Department of Justice’s civil rights division. Given his similarity to Ellison on policy, however, some analysts have argued that party officials should pick the Minnesota congressman to ensure the progressive activists excited about his candidacy ― and Sanders’ bid before that ― remain active in the party, rather than taking their enthusiasm elsewhere. And several prominent Ellison supporters have lamented the way aides to former President Barack Obama reportedly encouraged Perez to run after Ellison won the blessing of Sanders and establishment leaders like Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.).Some DNC members, however, resent the notion that they should be accommodating Sanders backers on the fence about remaining active in the party. Alabama DNC members Clinton Daughtrey and Janet May, both of whom backed Clinton in the primary, said on Friday that they were undecided on who to pick for DNC chair.One thing they were sure of was that they would not under any circumstances base their decisions on concerns about people who backed Sanders.“If I turned on C-Span two years ago and Senator Sanders was there, on the chyron in parentheses would be ‘I-Vt.’ If I turned on C-Span last year, the chyron would say ‘I-Vt.’ If I turned it on today, it would say ‘I-Vt.,’” Daughtrey said. “Thus, I want everybody in the tent. We want as many people engaged as possible in the Democratic Party, but if they do not want to identify as Democrats and build up the Democratic Party, then we’re no better than the cult of personality on the other side.”“Well said,” May chimed in. “I couldn’t say it any better.” DNC members’ most common response to questions about divisions within the party is that resistance to President Donald Trump will inevitably unify the warring factions. “We have a fight on our hands. It is not between Ellison and Perez,” Philips said.While DNC members are not interested in letting Ellison backers turn the DNC race into a more victorious version of Sanders’ primary challenge, they are extremely eager to link arms with the grassroots movement that has sprung up to oppose Trump. On Friday afternoon, a panel discussion of nine progressive leaders and political entrepreneurs convened by DNC vice chair candidate Liz Jaff was packed to the brim with DNC voting members begging the panelists for advice on how to tap into, and support, their work.One of the panelists, Winnie Wong, a co-founder of the People for Bernie Sanders collective, who helped write the principles of the Women’s March on Washington in January, is backing Ellison in the DNC chair race.But bringing grassroots activism under the party umbrella is not simply a matter of offering to collaborate in anti-Trump activities, Wong warned. If the DNC members are to succeed in harnessing the grassroots energy, she said, they cannot ignore the proxy race narrative that the public has developed about the contest for the DNC chairmanship.“The public opinion is already in place. There is a public opinion that frames one candidate as the establishment candidate and the other candidate as a candidate of the people,” Wong said, referring to Perez and Ellison respectively.“Are they going to ‘Dem-exit’ [if Ellison loses]? I’m sure some people will,” Wong said of Ellison enthusiasts. “But the majority of people will just ‘Dem-stagnate.’ And that’s not good.”"
70,MEDIA,Trump's War On The Media Echoes 2009. But The Press May Find It Harder To Fight.,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-media-war-obama_us_58b0e42ce4b060480e0836d6,Solidarity seems more elusive in the Trump era than when the Obama White House marginalized Fox News.,2017-02-25,"Journalists from news organizations including The New York Times, CNN and The Huffington Post were excluded from Friday's closed-door press gaggle.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b0ed4e2900001f000c312f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In October 2009, as the Obama White House felt besieged by what it viewed as advocacy journalism masquerading as “fair and balanced” news coverage, top aides to the president declared a de facto war on Fox News. On the morning of Oct. 18, David Axelrod, senior adviser to President Barack Obama, said that Fox would no longer be treated like other news organizations inside the walls of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. That same morning, White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel said the network was “not a news organization so much as it has a perspective.”What happened next was as important a development as the decision to wage the war itself. Fox News’ competitors rallied to its side, challenging the Obama administration’s claims about the network and then refusing to partake in a round of interviews with an administration official after Fox was excluded. It was a seminal moment of collective action by the Fourth Estate. And it worked. The White House backed down from its confrontation with Fox and the network’s executives and began charting a course of better understanding. Eight years later, the White House press corps faces a similar crisis point. The Trump administration on Friday excluded a number of prominent news outlets from a closed-door media “gaggle” that Press Secretary Sean Spicer conducted in lieu of a formal briefing. The barring of reporters followed weeks of unending broadsides that the president and his top aides have leveled against the press writ large and against certain television networks specifically, in which they’ve gone so far as to declare the media the “opposition party” and the “enemy of the American people.”The Associated Press and Time magazine boycotted Friday’s gaggle, while The Wall Street Journal said it would not go again under similar conditions. And one of Fox News’ most prominent anchors, Bret Baier, expressed solidarity with the excluded, echoing the sentiments of other anchors at his network, like Shepard Smith and Chris Wallace, who have criticized the Trump administration’s most recent anti-press rhetoric.But not everyone at Fox News has shown a willingness to stand alongside the rest of the press corps as was done in 2009. Some at the network, in fact, have appeared to cheer Trump on. Prime-time host Bill O’Reilly suggested last week that the Obama White House’s attacks on his network in 2009 were unwarranted while Trump’s critique has merit. “It’s harder to run the country because these dishonest people are undermining the whole process,” O’Reilly said. “Fox & Friends” co-host Steve Doocy referred to the media as “the opposition party” on Monday morning, a phrase popularized by Trump’s chief strategist, Steve Bannon. That night, host Sean Hannity told viewers the media had “declared war on President Trump and, by the way, in turn, you the American people who put him in office.” And they don’t seem to be the only ones in the press sympathetic to Trump as he blasts their colleagues. The White House press corps now features pro-Trump blogs that seem perfectly happy to side against the press corps. Gateway Pundit has talked about “trolling” the media along with covering the administration. And Breitbart News, a far-right, nationalist site that frequently targets the news media, has become a major player under this administration, with Bannon, its former chairman, in such a prominent role. Perhaps not surprisingly, Breitbart was invited into Spicer’s closed-door session, along with The Washington Times and One America News Network, two other conservative outlets whose stock has risen under the new administration and who recently have been called on first at briefings.All of this has left the press corps in a precarious position at a critical juncture. With Trump’s White House threatening access, it’s unclear whether the Fourth Estate will be able to muster the collective response that proved so effective in 2009.Back then, the Obama administration was lobbing similar, though hardly as incendiary, criticisms about the coverage it was receiving, from Fox News specifically. The network’s excessive promotion of conservative tea party protests in spring 2009, along with its perspective on administration policies, signaled to the president’s aides that it was approaching the administration in an overtly hostile manner. “I’ve got one television station that is entirely devoted to attacking my administration,” Obama said in June 2009. “That’s a pretty big megaphone. And you’d be hard pressed if you watched the entire day to find a positive story about me on that front.”What drove the Obama White House to try to marginalize Fox News wasn’t simply that the network leaned right, however. It was that the stories being promoted, such as the antics of the fringe New Black Panther Party, alleged corruption involving community organizing group ACORN and past radical statements from then-White House official Van Jones, were gaining traction in the national media.“There was a pipeline of stories coming from Fox News and then making it in the mainstream media outlets like the Post and the Times,” Dan Pfeiffer, a former top Obama adviser, recalled earlier this week. These stories, he said, were being treated as if “they were coming from other mainstream media outlets and given the journalistic scrutiny that would come in a story in The New York Times or The Wall Street Journal, when they weren’t.”What frustrated Obama officials even more was that Fox was promoting these stories during hours traditionally devoted to the day’s news. And at 5 p.m., on a daily basis, host Glenn Beck would amplify them further through his apocalyptic, yet entertaining, weaving of conspiracy theories. Beck would lay out his theories like a madman with a chalkboard. But he had an impact. He has been credited with prompting the Sept. 6, 2009, resignation of Jones after highlighting the past views and affiliations of the little-known environmental adviser. While the White House never tried barring Fox News from the briefing room, it declined invitations for Obama to appear on “Fox News Sunday” as he made the Sunday talk-show rounds in September 2009. “They are the biggest bunch of crybabies I have dealt with in my 30 years in Washington,” host Chris Wallace said in response. Later that month, Obama adviser Axelrod met privately at Washington’s Palm steakhouse with Roger Ailes, the famed Republican political operative and then chairman of Fox News, to try to hammer out the differences. But the fight escalated. “We’re going to treat them the way we would treat an opponent,” Anita Dunn, the White House communications director, told The New York Times on Oct. 11.A week later, Axelrod and Emanuel reinforced the anti-Fox message on the Sunday shows, and Obama reportedly vented privately about the network the following day to opinionated competitors in one of his off-the-record gatherings with newspaper columnists and commentators such as MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow.The press pushed back. On Oct. 20, Jake Tapper, then a White House correspondent for ABC News, asked Press Secretary Robert Gibbs during a morning gaggle to “explain why it’s appropriate for the White House to decide that a news organization is not one.” After a tense back-and-forth, Gibbs said it was simply the White House’s “opinion” that Fox News wasn’t a news organization. “I spoke up against it to the Obama staff both in front of others and behind the scenes, and on air when the State Department and Justice Department targeted James Rosen, because no government should get to say what is or isn’t legitimate or to discredit those doing their jobs responsibly ― that’s a way to undermine oversight,” Tapper recalled in an email to The Huffington Post. Two days later, bureau chiefs from the major networks pushed back against the treatment of Fox News by declining to participate in collective coverage of a Treasury Department briefing with executive-pay czar Ken Feinberg. The administration eventually backed down, letting Fox News into the pool and giving the network a win it would tout on air. “What happened today, I think, was extremely important,” Fox News analyst Charles Krauthammer said on the evening of Oct. 22. “In trying to ostracize and demonize Fox, the administration needs complicity from other news organizations. Otherwise it won’t work. What happened today was other news organizations admirably, and on principle, standing up and saying, ‘No, if you are not going to include Fox, we’re not going to go.’ And that solidarity, I think, is important.” The following day, Gibbs called a top Fox News executive to set up a truce, according to Gabriel Sherman’s biography of Ailes and his creation and stewardship of Fox News. And after a week or so, the war with Fox News simmered down and the relationship eventually returned to the status quo. Looking back, Axelrod told HuffPost that he didn’t think the war on Fox News “was a particularly successful tactic.” Though the administration’s complaints may have been “justifiable,” he said, “declaring war on a network ― or in Trump’s case, all but one ― is not an effective tactic.”“Most responsible journalists recognize the danger when one organization, even Fox News, is out on a ‘list,’” he added.But other Obama veterans, including Pfeiffer, felt the Obama White House “had some success” in its mission of adding scrutiny to Fox’s coverage. “We were far from perfect. It didn’t solve all the problems. We felt enough progress made.”That the press corps responded the way it did wasn’t a surprise, Pfeiffer added. Back then, the media was operating under the same general customs and traditions that had been in place for decades. But now, Pfeiffer said, it is a “different era,” one more ripe for exploitation by a White House. Trump, he noted, can broadcast his own unfiltered messages through social media or choose from a growing stable of friendly outlets if mainstream news outlets boycott an event.“Theoretically, there’s a world where they could say, ‘None of us are going to cover if you don’t do this,’” he said. “But they won’t do that because the Trump folks could just live-stream it on Facebook or Fox will carry it or Breitbart.”As for reporters covering the administration, it means less leverage to combat the same basic problems.

71,MEDIA,Trump's War On The Media Echoes 2009. But The Press May Find It Harder To Fight.,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-media-war-obama_us_58b0e42ce4b060480e0836d6,Solidarity seems more elusive in the Trump era than when the Obama White House marginalized Fox News.,2017-02-25,Glenn Beck hammered the Obama administration daily on Fox News. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b0ee512900002200f28a3d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In October 2009, as the Obama White House felt besieged by what it viewed as advocacy journalism masquerading as “fair and balanced” news coverage, top aides to the president declared a de facto war on Fox News. On the morning of Oct. 18, David Axelrod, senior adviser to President Barack Obama, said that Fox would no longer be treated like other news organizations inside the walls of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. That same morning, White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel said the network was “not a news organization so much as it has a perspective.”What happened next was as important a development as the decision to wage the war itself. Fox News’ competitors rallied to its side, challenging the Obama administration’s claims about the network and then refusing to partake in a round of interviews with an administration official after Fox was excluded. It was a seminal moment of collective action by the Fourth Estate. And it worked. The White House backed down from its confrontation with Fox and the network’s executives and began charting a course of better understanding. Eight years later, the White House press corps faces a similar crisis point. The Trump administration on Friday excluded a number of prominent news outlets from a closed-door media “gaggle” that Press Secretary Sean Spicer conducted in lieu of a formal briefing. The barring of reporters followed weeks of unending broadsides that the president and his top aides have leveled against the press writ large and against certain television networks specifically, in which they’ve gone so far as to declare the media the “opposition party” and the “enemy of the American people.”The Associated Press and Time magazine boycotted Friday’s gaggle, while The Wall Street Journal said it would not go again under similar conditions. And one of Fox News’ most prominent anchors, Bret Baier, expressed solidarity with the excluded, echoing the sentiments of other anchors at his network, like Shepard Smith and Chris Wallace, who have criticized the Trump administration’s most recent anti-press rhetoric.But not everyone at Fox News has shown a willingness to stand alongside the rest of the press corps as was done in 2009. Some at the network, in fact, have appeared to cheer Trump on. Prime-time host Bill O’Reilly suggested last week that the Obama White House’s attacks on his network in 2009 were unwarranted while Trump’s critique has merit. “It’s harder to run the country because these dishonest people are undermining the whole process,” O’Reilly said. “Fox & Friends” co-host Steve Doocy referred to the media as “the opposition party” on Monday morning, a phrase popularized by Trump’s chief strategist, Steve Bannon. That night, host Sean Hannity told viewers the media had “declared war on President Trump and, by the way, in turn, you the American people who put him in office.” And they don’t seem to be the only ones in the press sympathetic to Trump as he blasts their colleagues. The White House press corps now features pro-Trump blogs that seem perfectly happy to side against the press corps. Gateway Pundit has talked about “trolling” the media along with covering the administration. And Breitbart News, a far-right, nationalist site that frequently targets the news media, has become a major player under this administration, with Bannon, its former chairman, in such a prominent role. Perhaps not surprisingly, Breitbart was invited into Spicer’s closed-door session, along with The Washington Times and One America News Network, two other conservative outlets whose stock has risen under the new administration and who recently have been called on first at briefings.All of this has left the press corps in a precarious position at a critical juncture. With Trump’s White House threatening access, it’s unclear whether the Fourth Estate will be able to muster the collective response that proved so effective in 2009.Back then, the Obama administration was lobbing similar, though hardly as incendiary, criticisms about the coverage it was receiving, from Fox News specifically. The network’s excessive promotion of conservative tea party protests in spring 2009, along with its perspective on administration policies, signaled to the president’s aides that it was approaching the administration in an overtly hostile manner. “I’ve got one television station that is entirely devoted to attacking my administration,” Obama said in June 2009. “That’s a pretty big megaphone. And you’d be hard pressed if you watched the entire day to find a positive story about me on that front.”What drove the Obama White House to try to marginalize Fox News wasn’t simply that the network leaned right, however. It was that the stories being promoted, such as the antics of the fringe New Black Panther Party, alleged corruption involving community organizing group ACORN and past radical statements from then-White House official Van Jones, were gaining traction in the national media.“There was a pipeline of stories coming from Fox News and then making it in the mainstream media outlets like the Post and the Times,” Dan Pfeiffer, a former top Obama adviser, recalled earlier this week. These stories, he said, were being treated as if “they were coming from other mainstream media outlets and given the journalistic scrutiny that would come in a story in The New York Times or The Wall Street Journal, when they weren’t.”What frustrated Obama officials even more was that Fox was promoting these stories during hours traditionally devoted to the day’s news. And at 5 p.m., on a daily basis, host Glenn Beck would amplify them further through his apocalyptic, yet entertaining, weaving of conspiracy theories. Beck would lay out his theories like a madman with a chalkboard. But he had an impact. He has been credited with prompting the Sept. 6, 2009, resignation of Jones after highlighting the past views and affiliations of the little-known environmental adviser. While the White House never tried barring Fox News from the briefing room, it declined invitations for Obama to appear on “Fox News Sunday” as he made the Sunday talk-show rounds in September 2009. “They are the biggest bunch of crybabies I have dealt with in my 30 years in Washington,” host Chris Wallace said in response. Later that month, Obama adviser Axelrod met privately at Washington’s Palm steakhouse with Roger Ailes, the famed Republican political operative and then chairman of Fox News, to try to hammer out the differences. But the fight escalated. “We’re going to treat them the way we would treat an opponent,” Anita Dunn, the White House communications director, told The New York Times on Oct. 11.A week later, Axelrod and Emanuel reinforced the anti-Fox message on the Sunday shows, and Obama reportedly vented privately about the network the following day to opinionated competitors in one of his off-the-record gatherings with newspaper columnists and commentators such as MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow.The press pushed back. On Oct. 20, Jake Tapper, then a White House correspondent for ABC News, asked Press Secretary Robert Gibbs during a morning gaggle to “explain why it’s appropriate for the White House to decide that a news organization is not one.” After a tense back-and-forth, Gibbs said it was simply the White House’s “opinion” that Fox News wasn’t a news organization. “I spoke up against it to the Obama staff both in front of others and behind the scenes, and on air when the State Department and Justice Department targeted James Rosen, because no government should get to say what is or isn’t legitimate or to discredit those doing their jobs responsibly ― that’s a way to undermine oversight,” Tapper recalled in an email to The Huffington Post. Two days later, bureau chiefs from the major networks pushed back against the treatment of Fox News by declining to participate in collective coverage of a Treasury Department briefing with executive-pay czar Ken Feinberg. The administration eventually backed down, letting Fox News into the pool and giving the network a win it would tout on air. “What happened today, I think, was extremely important,” Fox News analyst Charles Krauthammer said on the evening of Oct. 22. “In trying to ostracize and demonize Fox, the administration needs complicity from other news organizations. Otherwise it won’t work. What happened today was other news organizations admirably, and on principle, standing up and saying, ‘No, if you are not going to include Fox, we’re not going to go.’ And that solidarity, I think, is important.” The following day, Gibbs called a top Fox News executive to set up a truce, according to Gabriel Sherman’s biography of Ailes and his creation and stewardship of Fox News. And after a week or so, the war with Fox News simmered down and the relationship eventually returned to the status quo. Looking back, Axelrod told HuffPost that he didn’t think the war on Fox News “was a particularly successful tactic.” Though the administration’s complaints may have been “justifiable,” he said, “declaring war on a network ― or in Trump’s case, all but one ― is not an effective tactic.”“Most responsible journalists recognize the danger when one organization, even Fox News, is out on a ‘list,’” he added.But other Obama veterans, including Pfeiffer, felt the Obama White House “had some success” in its mission of adding scrutiny to Fox’s coverage. “We were far from perfect. It didn’t solve all the problems. We felt enough progress made.”That the press corps responded the way it did wasn’t a surprise, Pfeiffer added. Back then, the media was operating under the same general customs and traditions that had been in place for decades. But now, Pfeiffer said, it is a “different era,” one more ripe for exploitation by a White House. Trump, he noted, can broadcast his own unfiltered messages through social media or choose from a growing stable of friendly outlets if mainstream news outlets boycott an event.“Theoretically, there’s a world where they could say, ‘None of us are going to cover if you don’t do this,’” he said. “But they won’t do that because the Trump folks could just live-stream it on Facebook or Fox will carry it or Breitbart.”As for reporters covering the administration, it means less leverage to combat the same basic problems. Eight years after he went to bat for Fox News as it was blacklisted from the White House, Tapper finds himself in their shoes. One of the most aggressive journalists covering the Trump administration, he and CNN have been singled out for ridicule and frozen out in general. The administration did not include the network in Friday’s briefing, and it has declined to book key officials on Tapper’s Sunday show. It’s an echo of 2009, Tapper noted. “I wouldn’t say the efforts to delegitimize are exactly the same, but the principle (or lack thereof) is: Discredit an entire ... credentialed organization (or multiple organizations, in President Trump’s case) based on a facet of the outlet’s coverage that he doesn’t like,” he said.

Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) for not hosting a public town hall meeting during this week’s congressional recess demonstrated at her appearance at the Public Policy Institute of California on Friday, pressing the longtime senator to face her constituents in person.The event, billed as “a conversation” with Feinstein, was open to the public, but tickets were lapped up quickly due to the relatively small venue. Demonstrators, many on their lunch breaks, gathered outside the PPIC offices in San Francisco’s Financial District, demanding the senator host a larger meeting with her constituents. Some protesters held signs with question marks, symbolizing the queries they have for the senator.“It’d be really great if we had the chance to sit down at a town hall environment and talk with [Feinstein] about all the concerns we have about the current administration, and we haven’t been given that opportunity,” said Elizabeth Hall of San Francisco, one of several dozen people who came to protest outside the event. “So I felt compelled to come out here and make sure that she knows we want to talk to her, and that we’re ready to talk to her.”Inside the event, some attendees tried their best to create a raucous town hall-style atmosphere. Some held up green sheets of paper when they agreed with Feinstein’s remarks, and red sheets when they disagreed. The audience alternately cheered and booed, shouting support for policies like single-payer health care or investigating President Donald Trump’s administration over its ties to Russian officials. One attendee held a sign that read, “This is not a town hall,” emphasizing widely held sentiments by protesters that the moderated discussion with Feinstein would not replace actually meeting with her constituents.But unlike traditional town hall meetings, the PPIC event didn’t permit audience members to question Feinstein in person until the last 20 minutes. Instead, discussion moderator and PPIC President Mark Baldassare read several questions pre-submitted by audience members. He discouraged the audience from yelling out their questions, and was met with boos when he tried to stop audience members from shouting at Feinstein to push for a special prosecutor to investigate the president.Feinstein, however, didn’t seem to mind the outbursts from the audience.“I kind of like it,” Feinstein said of the lively crowd.Several other protests have targeted Feinstein in her hometown. In January, about 200 people gathered outside her home in the city’s tony Pacific Heights neighborhood to demand she vote against confirming Trump’s pick for attorney general, Jeff Sessions. The next day, about 50 Bay Area attorneys protested outside her downtown San Francisco office, also in opposition to the attorney general. (Feinstein ultimately voted against Sessions’ confirmation.)Indivisible East Bay, an activist group formed in resistance to the Trump administration, will host an “empty chair” town hall in Oakland on Sunday. Protesters in Los Angeles have similarly requested time with the senator, and constituents from across the state continue to flood her phone lines with calls and messages about Trump and his policies.During Friday’s conversation, Feinstein spoke broadly about her plans to resist Trump’s agenda. She declined to say how she’ll vote on Trump’s nominee to the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch, saying she’ll wait to see how he responds to questions during his confirmation hearings on gun control and reproductive rights.She also spoke about her role on the Senate Intelligence Committee, and the ongoing investigations into Trump’s controversial ties to Russia. She specifically pointed to the probes into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, saying her committee is “dedicated” to investigating the matter.“It is so important that this never happen again,” she said on Russian hacking.Some questions were allowed at the very end of the program. The first questioner pressed Feinstein to commit to more town halls, and asked whether she would attend Sunday’s “empty chair” town hall. “We need more access to you directly,” he said.But Feinstein declined to attend the Sunday event, noting that she needs to return to Washington, D.C. However, she said she would “try” to host more open events with constituents in the future.“I pretty much know how my people feel,” she said of her constituents. “But maybe I don’t know exactly how you feel. So maybe I should provide an opportunity, and I will.”Feinstein’s office has said it decided against hosting a town hall because this recess was just one week long. But that time constraint didn’t stop many of her colleagues from meeting with their constituents. Those lawmakers, including Republican Sens. Mitch McConnell (Ky.), Tom Cotton (Ark.) and Chuck Grassley (Iowa), were met with large, angry crowds seeking answers on health care reform, immigration and other issues.But some lawmakers have dodged public appearances altogether. Some have opted for conference calls instead of in-person meetings, while others have threatened to cancel events if protesters show up."

Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) said during an interview on “Real Time With Bill Maher” on Friday night that the investigation into Russia’s ties to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and the U.S. election hacking needs a special prosecutor ― not Attorney General Jeff Sessions.The conservative congressman, who supported Trump during his 2016 campaign, also seemed to agree with host Bill Maher that Sessions should recuse himself from the investigation.Maher posed a question to Issa about the FBI’s investigation Trump-Russia by flipping the controversy on its head.Maher asked Issa if, in 2012, he “would let it slide” had Russians hacked Mitt Romney’s campaign and been in talks with former President Barack Obama’s campaign.“No,” Issa said quickly. When asked if he’d let it slide in Trump’s administration, Issa said again, just as quickly: “No.”“We need an independent prosecutor,” Maher said later. “And Jeff Sessions should recuse himself, the same way Loretta Lynch recused herself, because he was a part of the Trump campaign, is that correct?” Maher asked, referring to former Attorney General Lynch and Hillary Clinton’s email investigation.That’s when Issa appeared to make his response more clear.“You’re right that you cannot have somebody, a friend of mine, Jeff Sessions, who was on the campaign and who was an appointee,” Issa told Maher. “You’re going to need to use the special prosecutor’s statute and office.”Then, Issa doubles down on his statement with a critical take on Russia.“Here’s the reason we’re going to have to do it, Bill,” the congressman said. “There may or may not be fault, but the American people are beginning to understand that Putin murders his enemies sometimes right in front of the Kremlin ... he’s murdered people and taken down using cyber warfare in Georgia and Ukraine.“This is a bad guy who murders people. Who runs a gas station with an economy the size of Italy but is screwing up things all over the world, that we’ve been, quote, ‘working with.’“Now, we have to work with them. We don’t have to trust them. And we need to investigate their activities, and we need to do it because they are bad people.”See Issa’s conversation with Maher below."

I was there for a preview screening of the first episode of “When We Rise,” a four-part television docudrama that follows the lives of three young people who in the early ‘70s became trailblazers in the LGBTQ rights movement.The “When We Rise” miniseries will debut Monday night, Feb. 27 on ABC TV at 9p/8c. Due to an address to Congress by President Obama’s successor, the three subsequent two-hour episodes will air March 1 to March 3, also at 9p/8c.As I watched the stories of real-life activists Roma Guy, Cleve Jones and Ken Jones unfold on the screen, I felt myself becoming emotionally involved. I was reminded of the pain LGBTQ people suffered then – and still suffer – often at the hands of law enforcement. I choked up during the conversation young Cleve Jones has with his physician father, reminded that many in the medical profession back then considered being gay or trans a mental illness, “curable” with conversion therapy or electroshock treatments. And I jotted down lines from the show that have been running through my mind ever since.“When did you know you needed to rise up?”“The arc of history is long, but it bends towards justice.”“I feel like fighting back today, don’t you?”“We have to create our own power to ensure our safety.”In the discussion after the screening, the show’s writer and creator Dustin Lance Black was asked what impact he thought the miniseries would have in our current post-election world. “I think it’s critical that people remember the ‘we’ in ‘When We Rise,’” he said, “so we can stop this backlash and we can push that momentum forward again.” The we in the audience applauded with a sense of urgency.I’d known on my way to the theater that the current Republican administration could at any moment rescind anti-discrimination protections for transgender students. But that didn’t stop the combined body wave of nausea and anxiety I felt on my train ride home after the breaking news popped up on my phone: those Obama-era guidelines had been reversed. The irony of this happening on the night I’d just viewed the important history lessons in “When We Rise” rang in my head like a fire alarm. How could it be in 2017 that schools no longer had a duty to treat transgender girls and boys with the same fairness and respect they treat other girls and boys?I didn’t want to believe that the progress of the LGBTQ rights movement, like the civil rights movement that preceded it, could ever be rolled back. And yet here we are, American citizens governed by a Republican administration that has begun attacking the basic rights of our most vulnerable people: transgender and gender-nonconforming children.I know this isn’t just about children, but that’s where the Republican administration has chosen to start. The so-called “bathroom bills” and “bathroom debate” continue to be called that and messaged as such under the Republican party’s efforts to defeat civil rights protections for a broad range of people. Their language is about creating fear ― fear of the unknown, fear of “the other” ― in order to enact rules and legislation that will eventually strip LGBTQ people of basic freedoms, rights and protections.But no matter how challenging or difficult these weeks since Jan. 20 may be, I know that LGBTQ progress is progress. As a nation we must not turn back. And as parents, families, educators, advocates, allies, or anyone with a moral compass, we cannot be complacent. We must stay informed, stand up, speak out, attend school board meetings, reassure vulnerable kids we have their backs, and send messages to the federal government insisting on its duty to ensure that all transgender and gender-nonconforming students are protected from discrimination, bullying and harassment.Those children, adult members of the LGBTQ community and its allies, along with all other marginalized groups, will never be alone. We are in this together. And like those freedom fighters before us, we must never give up.

No one should be denied the opportunity to see a doctor because of how much money is in their pocket or where they live. Our loved ones shouldn’t die from easily curable diseases simply because they can’t afford medicine. Black lives matter.Why are these controversial statements? Why are we living under an administration that thinks it is politically expedient to rip away our access to basic healthcare?Yes, denying people access to healthcare is the perfect way to accomplish your goals if your goals include severely restricting the flow of health resources to marginalized communities and pouring gasoline on the flames of white supremacy; making people of color too sick to earn a living, too sick to learn in school and too sick to raise families. But most of all, keep us too sick to challenge illegitimate authority. That’s exactly what we’re up against.Unfortunately, this tactic isn’t new. During slavery, slave owners frequently offered only the bare minimum of healthcare and food to their enslaved people, keeping them barely healthy enough to work. And when enslaved Black women like Anarcha, Lucy, and Betsey were forcibly coerced into medical experiments, Black bodies were sacrificed in the name of white women’s health and because white men, feeding their own “scientific” curiosity, also refused to acknowledge that these women felt pain just like anyone else. The bodily violence these Black women experienced was never because anyone actually cared for the health and well being of Black women.In times of terror, like these, one thing we never lost from our ancestors is the necessity to dream. We know how to hold onto the belief that the arc of justice will eventually find its way home – we have to. In all honesty, as a reproductive justice activist, it’s the only way I know how to move forward, despite incredible odds and near constant political, physical, and personal attacks. Even under a friendly presidential administration, access to abortion care and the full spectrum of reproductive healthcare services have been decimated. Several women, particularly women of color, have been thrown in jail and charged with felonies because they needed abortions and couldn’t afford them, and those who were already in jail have been denied access. Our lack of healthcare access and protections is leading to incarceration. It should never be a crime to seek healthcare.Like the Movement for Black Lives, the movement for reproductive justice was founded by women of color, and women who believe that everyone, particularly communities of color, deserve high quality, culturally competent and compassionate healthcare, that the freedom to decide when to become a parent and how to grow their families is a basic right and that everyone has the right and ought to have the resources to raise healthy children free from violence, economic coercion and environmental harm.When it comes to healthcare, abortion, transgender, indigenous and disability rights are the canaries in the coal mine. If you want to see the future of healthcare under this illegitimate administration, all you have to do is see what has happened since 2010 at the state level and who chose to look the other way as our rights were trampled. Access to abortion is barely a right in half of our states: Black people with mental illnesses are 16 times more likely to be murdered by, as Marvin Gaye said, “trigger happy police,” the government refuses to acknowledge the sovereignty of indigenous people’s land and trans women of color are routinely murdered while our nation ignores their plight. I refuse to accept this. We have the ability to create something else, and are at a turning point where we must or we will perish.We have to fantasize about the potential for a future of Black health and Black freedom. I choose to imagine a taxpayer-funded health center, founded on the needs of Black women, transgender and nonbinary people and based on the brilliance I’ve already seen across this nation. As a taxpayer, I want the taxes I pay to reflect my and our nation’s values, and I believe we can find better ways to spend the Department of Defense’s nearly $600 billion budget currently allocated to raze Black and Brown communities around the world. Keeping people healthy and safe feels like the perfect way to do it. With the appropriation of this new budget, we’ll be able to raise the Medicaid reimbursement rate, which is important to ensure more people have access to care. However, my dream health center will take all patients, no matter their ability to pay, immigration status or health condition.My imagined center will be named after Dr. Joycelyn Elders and will welcome all of you.Dr. Joycelyn Elders was a fierce pediatrician and the first Black Surgeon General of the United States. During her tenure, Dr. Elders was outspoken on holistic approaches to healthcare, advocated for access to comprehensive sexual health education, called out racist health textbooks, advocated for abortion access and contraception in schools and famously supported teaching masturbation; a bold and unapologetic Black namesake for a brazen and dynamic dream health center.The Elders Center will be located conveniently near public transportation. Inspired by the practical support program at ACCESS Women’s Health Justice in California, the Elders Center will also offer funding and complimentary rides on the Diane Nash rides program for those who need assistance arriving at their appointments When patients enter the Elders Center, they’ll be welcomed into an open space decorated by brightly colored furniture and painted walls, much like the Queens, New York, Planned Parenthood. Modeled after the Whole Woman’s Health abortion clinics, patient rooms will be named after Black feminist leaders like Harriet Tubman, Coretta Scott King and Ida B. Wells and inscribed with inspirational quotes by women such as Audre Lorde, Patti LaBelle and Sojourner Truth.The Melissa Harris Perry wing of the center will offer abortion, birthing and delivery, miscarriage management, adoption, egg freezing, surrogacy and infertility services all on the same floor. There will be no need to stigmatize or arbitrarily separate people. Midwives and doulas will be on hand for all pregnant people who want them. Elders Center staff will thoughtfully advise patients with uterine fibroids and offer holistic approaches to treatment, while maintaining fertility as patients desire. Like the Birthing Center of Buffalo / Buffalo WomenServices, the providers will be there for patients no matter what decision they make about their pregnancies. Lactation specialists on the Ella Baker floor will ensure everyone who would like to chestfeed their child has the education and tools to do so, including trans and nonbinary people.Because it’s important that we treat whole people and not just their body parts, the Carlett A. Brown wing will offer reproductive healthcare services for people of all genders – everything from contraception and Pap smears to hormones and fertility preservation – similar to the Allentown Women’s Center in Pennsylvania. And because of the deep racial disparities in cancer diagnosis and treatment availability, particularly breast cancer, the Pauli Murray cancer ward will offer state-of-the-art screening and treatment. Inspired by SisterLove in Atlanta, the Alvin Ailey program will run a community bus that offers HIV testing, medication delivery and weekly support peer-led groups.The Elders Center will also have a resource center for all pregnancy options, including a diaper bank, condoms, an abortion fund and counselors, like the All-Options Pregnancy Resource Center in Bloomington, Indiana. The Claudette Colvin program will engage young parents in policy efforts, and offer baby showers, childcare, postpartum support groups and pregnancy photoshoots to break stigma like the Homeless Prenatal Program in San Francisco. The Josephine Baker program will run support groups and activities for adoptive families, and the Marsha P. Johnson program will run them for transgender folks and their loved ones.The Elders Center will run a number of counseling and resource programs, as well, to address historic issues and issues currently impacting Black communities. Counselors will be on hand in the Fannie Lou Hamer room to sit with patients who have been forcibly sterilized, and in the Rosa Parks room for survivors of sexual assault who need time to process their experience. Compassion and listening are key to healing. The Maya Angelou program will offer support and defense for sex workers when harmed by clients and law enforcement, and will ensure they are able to continue to work safely in healthy environments. SisterReach’s faith-based civic engagement programing in Memphis will serve as the structure for the Anna Julia Cooper advocacy program designed to increase voter enrollment, local political education and support for community members to run for office. We need people to be engaged now more than ever.If we are going to withstand the destructive policies of this incoming administration, we’ll have to be even more creative. Our imaginations and grit will see us through a dark era, just like our ancestors showed they could do in the past and our friends are doing across the nation right now.As we’re living in this nightmare of an administration, this is the future I’ll be working towards. This is my dream – my plan for resistance.This post is part of the Black Futures Month blog series brought to you by The Huffington Post and the Black Lives Matter Network.

80,RELIGION,Tears For Zakir Khan,"Rashidul Bari, ContributorA Servant of Education",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tears-for-zakir-khan_us_58b121bae4b02f3f81e447ce,"I reached out to Khan when I was poor. However, he did not reach out to me when he became poor. In fact, I have received",2017-02-25,<p>Zakir Khan receives award from several ministers of Bangladesh. </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b122202900004b000c3184.png?ops=crop_0_0_1668_1042%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"It was Feb. 22, 2017. I was teaching mathematics at Bronx C. College in New York City. In the middle of class, I saw a message from my wife on my phone: “Zakir Khan was stabbed to death by his landlord.” I turned off the phone and tried to focus on teaching graphing polynomials. However, I struggled to write anything on the chalkboard. “Professor, is everything OK?” one of my students asked. “Yes, everything is fine,” I responded. However, it turned out that everything was not fine, and I had to dismiss class early. “I have a family emergency, guys. See you Thursday.”When everyone left, I asked myself, “Why did I say I have a family emergency?” Khan is not my family member. He is not even my friend. In fact, I never met him personally. He was simply my Facebook friend. I have 5,000 Facebook friends, and I don’t know many of them. So why should I shed tears for Khan? Well, the story goes back to February 2009. I was not professor back then; in fact, I was a security guard.I was desperately looking to rent a room (not an apartment) for my family, my wife and son, Albert, (Isaac was not born then) who had recently arrived in America from Bangladesh. (I never had any home before the arrival of my wife and son because I used to work as a security guard at night and attend school during the day.) However, every landlord turned me down when they learned about my income. Nobody seemed to understand that security guards don’t make much money. On top of it, I had to pay my tuition. So I had to keep my wife and son in my relative’s house for days. I reached out to many people but realized that nobody had the time for a poor security guard. Around this time, I read a news article about Khan from a mainstream newspaper:“Parkchester real estate King Zakir Khan lives the American Dream. He has a thriving business, a growing family and owns a home in Throgs Neck adjacent to the future site of a Donald Trump championship golf course.”I immediately sent him a friend request on Facebook. I had no idea why he would accept a friend request from a security guard, but he did. I decided to wait a few days (a few days was like a month for me) before asking his help to rent a room. Meanwhile, I visited his Facebook page and realized that he was not only a successful businessman but also a loving husband to Nancy Khan and a very caring father to their three beautiful children, Ramin, Taiba and Eklel.A week later, I sent him the request for help on Facebook. It was February 2009. I did not expect any response. To my surprise, he asked me how much I could afford. I informed him that I could pay only $400 a month. The next morning, I received three phone calls from three landlords, all of whom wanted to rent me a room.I chose one in Gleason Avenue, a few feet away from the Parkchester Jame Mosque. Finally, we were able to live together under one rooftop three weeks after the arrival of my wife and son from Bangladesh. Since then, we as a family fell in love with Khan. Numerous times I brought Bengali newspapers just to read his stories.We left that room in 2010, but we will always love it. It was like a magic box. Only a few people would understand the painful experience of being homeless. I couldn’t believe that such a man had to be killed by his landlord for owing rent. Why did he owe rent? He was the king of Parkchester. When did he lose his kingdom? How did that happen? I turned on the computer and Googled his name. A news report from Time TV caught my attention:“Taha Mahran, a 51 [year] old landlord of Zakir Khan, plunged the knife into the 44 year-old victim 20 times because the latter owed him rent. I saw Eklel (now 12-year-old) witness the attack, standing helpless and horrified only a few feet away. ‘Eklel!’ a dying Zakir Khan, shouted outside their Bronx home. ‘Help me! Call 911!’ Eklel started as enraged landlord Mahran grabbed Khan by the jacket, pulled him to the ground and started furiously plunging a kitchen knife into his neck, head and torso.”I couldn’t read the news anymore. It was so heartbreaking.I reached out to Khan when I was poor. However, he did not reach out to me when he became poor. In fact, I have received the last and final message from him some 5 years ago on the Facebook. He asked me to translate a Bengali sentence to English. The message above surprised me because I didn’t know that Khan was a very secular person. In fact, his Bangali line reminds me of the ideology of Tagore and Nazrul, the two Bengali poets, who also opposed the cultural nationalism that has recently been gaining ground in America since President Obama left office. Zakir Khan’s Bengali line reminds me of his uncompromising belief that human beings including Muslims should absorb different religions in constructive ways. That’s why I borrowed the ideologies of Tagore and Nazrul to translate Zakir Khan’s Bangla sentence: Whatever we can enjoy in human products instantly becomes ours including Eid, Christmas, Easter, Saraswati, Torah regardless of their origin. As a Muslim, I am proud of my humanity when I can acknowledge the festivals of other religion as my own. Let me feel with unalloyed gladness that all the great holidays including Eid, Christmas, Easter, Saraswati, Torah are mine. He was a good man. However, poverty and goodness are mutually exclusive. Khan might have made a mistake by falling behind in the rent, but that doesn’t mean Mahran had to kill a father in front of his child in the most brutal way possible. Mahran’s behavior reminds me of the behavior of ISIS.When one becomes enamored with a principle, as Mahran has, one also becomes blind to alternatives. As such, it is as though a hobgoblin has entered his imagination, blocking the ability to see alternatives. We certainly witnessed the blindness of ISIS in the behavior of Mahran.I left Bronx Community College for home at 8:30 p.m., with the idea that soon I would forget the tragic death of Zakir Khan. There is no benefit in being able to recall these events, no benefit in being able to remember the faces of Ramin (who is just two year older than my son, Isaac), Taiba and Eklel (who had to watch the killing of his own father).So I tried my best to forget everything I had seen and read, and I thought I would soon forget everything. But I was wrong.I got home at around 10 p.m. It all flooded back to me when Albert opened the door and Soborno Isaac jumped onto my lap. Immediately it popped into my mind: where would Ramin, Taiba and Eklel jump now? I skipped dinner and took sleeping pills for the first time in my life, hoping a sound night’s sleep would help me to forget the innocent faces of those three beautiful children. However, it all flooded back again in the morning, as I dropped both my sons off at the library.Zakir Khan picked them up from the library an hour before Mahran killed him. For a moment, I took the place of Khan. For a moment, I felt like the father of Ramin, Taiba and Eklel. Who would drop them off at the library now?Rashidul Bari teaches Mathematics at Bronx C.
