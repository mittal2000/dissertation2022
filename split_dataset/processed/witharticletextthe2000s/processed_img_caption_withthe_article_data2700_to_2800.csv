2,POLITICS,Donald Trump Will Take An Oath To Defend A Constitution He May Not Even Understand,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-constitution_us_5880d845e4b02c1837e9fd90,The solemn public vow could change him. It may also mean absolutely nothing to him.,2017-01-20,"As president, Donald Trump will meet the Constitution head-on.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58820f351700002e00fdfba3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK ― Donald Trump won the White House on promises: Deporting millions. Banning and surveilling Muslims. Bringing back waterboarding. Making it easier to sue the press. Imprisoning your political adversaries.If implemented, there’s little doubt that every one of these proposals and policies would crash head-on with the Constitution.And yet around noon on Friday, as the same founding document mandates, President-elect Donald Trump is set to become President Donald Trump — by sheer virtue of a promise he’s never made before: a solemn oath to protect, preserve and defend the Constitution of the United States.With Chief Justice John Roberts and the world as witnesses, Trump will be vowing to stand up not for his interests, his ego, his Twitter account. But rather for a document that he’s likely never read, let alone had the time or interest to reflect on how its guarantees of equality, due process of law and many freedoms put a check on government and the power of the president.Can the public even hold to his word a president for whom truth appears to carry almost no weight?“What does it mean to have a bullshit artist as President of the United States — a leader both responsible for and constrained by the rule of law?” pondered a post-election essay by Quinta Jurecic, a writer at the Brookings Institution who has studied political theory.It’s a question that boggles the mind and for which Americans have no answer, in part because Americans have never handed their highest office to a businessman with no experience in public service and such little regard toward the rule of law, the judges who look after it and a system of government that depends as much on written laws as on unwritten norms that keep it together.If President Barack Obama, a mindful student of the Constitution and the courts, thought it prudent to ask his Office of Legal Counsel for guidance on whether the Emoluments Clause barred his acceptance of the Nobel Peace Prize his first year in office, Trump has shown no such prudence.“The law’s totally on my side ― meaning, the president can’t have a conflict of interest,” Trump has said, dismissing warnings from a government ethics watchdog and experts with experience under Republican and Democratic presidents who have charged that his business entanglements will find him in violation of his oath from the very moment he takes it.It is possible, as UCLA law professor Richard Re has written, for a public official to feel the moral weight of his oath and his office as soon as he takes on its powers and responsibilities. And in that sense, Trump could very well become a different man as the burdens of the job become more real to him.“I think that no one who takes an oath to the Constitution is fully aware of all the complexities of law,” Re told The Huffington Post back in November. “Part of what the oath means is making an effort to understand what the Constitution requires as events unfold.”Campaign promises can be broken, and for that a politician may pay a political price. But a presidential oath is wholly independent of those promises, carrying its own set of obligations. Under its terms, Trump can only be held to his promise to “faithfully” execute his office and to safeguard the Constitution.In the final case of the Obama administration before the Supreme Court earlier this week — a dispute over Bush-era civil rights abuses, no less — Justice Stephen Breyer seemed to put these duties in perspective, and portend the courts’ role in the coming years.“There’s no blank check, even for the president. And if there’s no blank check, that means sometimes they can go too far. And if they have gone too far, it is our job to say that,” he said in open court.Because Trump is such an unprecedented figure in American history, that admonition really extends to everyone — the public, Congress, the courts — regardless of political persuasion. As he takes the oath Friday, the Constitution itself may depend on it.“As citizens of a country that purports to live under the rule of law, we have a duty to insist that words have meaning,” Jurecic wrote in her essay, “even when the President swears an oath he doesn’t even understand.”How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

That happened today.”Frizz said volunteers began rolling the joints at least three weeks ago, and used 10 pounds of weed donated by local growers.Late in the morning, some of the activists broke away from the marijuana giveaway to march toward the inauguration ceremony, where they lit up their joints 4 minutes and 20 seconds into Trump’s inauguration speech. Frizz said the group smoke session resulted in zero arrests.The free distribution of weed is perfectly legal under D.C. law, which allows people to possess up to two ounces of the drug, but bars smoking it in public places or selling it.“We’re trying to show that cannabis is an issue that is an American issue,” DCMJ co-founder Nikolas Schiller told The Huffington Post. “It’s non-partisan, and we believe that we can make millions of jobs happen, increase tax revenue for states and help fix the broken criminal justice system.”Marijuana remains banned under federal law, and activists said they feared the Trump administration would revive enforcement in states and localities that have legalized it. Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), Trump’s pick for attorney general, has been an outspoken opponent of marijuana legalization.“Good people don’t smoke marijuana,” Sessions said in a Senate hearing in April. “We need grown-ups in charge in Washington saying marijuana is not the kind of thing that ought to be legalized, it ought to be minimized, that it is in fact a very real danger.”Schiller said he hopes the new president will use his business background to reap tax revenue and promote jobs that would flow from legalized marijuana.“He has the opportunity to make America great again by allowing Americans to grow what George Washington once grew, which is cannabis,” Schiller said.Giant pot leaf mascot Hempy, a member of the pro-weed group Delaware NORML, said he hoped the weed giveaway would boost attention for nationwide marijuana legalization. “It’s a plant,” Hempy told HuffPost. “And I feel that if you can grow tomatoes, why can’t you grown cannabis, you know?” Trump told Fox News host Bill O’Reilly in February that he favors medical marijuana “100 percent,” but called Colorado’s legalized marijuana industry “a real problem.”"

Incoming president Donald Trump takes his place among deep skepticism from much of the country. And views of both men ―and the country as a whole ― are deeply polarized.This is HuffPollster for Friday, January 20, 2017.FINAL PRE-INAUGURATION POLLS SHOW HOW AMERICANS WILL REMEMBER BARACK OBAMA…-Washington Post/ABC News: “Barack Obama leaves office Friday with 6 in 10 Americans approving of his job performance, capping a steady rise that vaults him above the average final mark for modern presidents...Obama’s high-note finish comes with plenty of dissonance, including persistent pessimism about the nation’s direction and deep divisions after Donald Trump’s victory in last year’s presidential race after campaigning strongly against Obama’s policies... in the last few years, the share of Americans with positive ratings of the economy has more than doubled to 51 percent in this month’s survey, the highest level tracked by Post-ABC polls during his tenure.” [WashPost]-Morning Consult/Politico: “As President Barack Obama prepares to leave office after eight years in the White House, voters...gave him high marks on three issues: the economy, gender equality and racial equality.” [Morning Consult]-CNN/ORC: “Americans views of Obamacare tilt narrowly positive, according to a new CNN/ORC poll, marking the first time more have favored than opposed the law since its passage in 2010….More have opposed than favored the law in every CNN/ORC poll on this question from March 2010 until now...Still, few feel the ACA has done much to help them personally.” [CNN]...AND WHAT THEY EXPECT FROM DONALD TRUMP’S ADMINISTRATION-NBC/WSJ: “A majority of Americans — 52 percent — say they disapprove of the way President-elect Trump has handled his transition and preparations for the presidency, versus just 44 percent who approve, which is down six points from only a month ago….[T]he public supports many of Trump’s individual policy goals - even if they don’t support him personally.” [NBC]-Pew Research: “Nearly two-thirds of Americans (64%) say wealthy people will gain influence in Washington when Trump takes office….In addition, about half of the public thinks whites (51%), men (51%) and conservative Christians (52%) will gain influence.” More from the survey: “While the 2016 elections have done little to brighten the public’s overall outlook or raise expectations for partisan cooperation, the Republican Party has seen its standing improve in the wake of Trump’s presidential win and the GOP maintaining control of Congress. Today, about as many hold a favorable (47%) as unfavorable (49%) view of the Republican Party.” [Pew, second release]-Monmouth University: “The public is divided on just how much Trump’s presidency will help the middle class - 26% say a lot, 40% a little, and 29% not at all. This is not much different from public perceptions of how much the middle class has benefited from the outgoing Obama administration’s policy - 24% say a lot, 41% a little, and 33% not at all. These nearly identical results mask some significant demographic differences within the American population though.” [Monmouth]-SurveyMonkey: “Democrats and independents are far more skeptical of Trump than of President Barack Obama. They are also far more fearful of the future to come on a wide range of issues, from the economy to health care, race relations and the treatment of women, than are Republicans….The continuing polarization of politics also affects more than ratings of the President-elect. It drives how Americans perceive the economy and a wide range of issues. So while Republicans are mostly optimistic about their new president and positive about the future, other Americans are far more anxious and fearful.” [SurveyMonkey]-Fox News: “First, only one-third of voters describe the national mood as ‘we’re all in this together.’ Nearly twice as many feel like it’s everyone for themselves. And half say they’re tired of politics and ‘want it to go away.’ Voters also split over whether opportunities in the country favor ‘other people’ or people like them.” [Fox]-AP-NORC: “More than 4-in-10 Republicans, Democrats and independents say health care is a top issue facing the country, The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll showed. That’s more than named any other issue in the survey, conducted Dec. 14-19. But there seems to be little agreement on what to do about it. Democrats say they want to fix problems in the current program — among them, rising costs and dwindling competition — but not dismantle it. They warn that the GOP is threatening the coverage gained by 20 million people under the 2010 overhaul. Republicans want to repeal Obama’s signature law but fear the political damage of stranding millions of Americans who secured coverage.” [AP]PUBLIC SPLIT WITH TRUMP ON VACCINATIONS - HuffPollster, with Arthur Delaney: “President-elect Donald Trump’s skepticism about the safety of childhood vaccines contrasts not only with the scientific consensus, but also with the opinions of Americans ― fewer than one-quarter of whom think immunization should be a matter of personal choice….But although a majority of Democrats and Republicans still support vaccination, the minor partisan divides present in the 2015 survey appear to have modestly widened.” [HuffPost]AMERICANS OVERWHELMINGLY SAY IT’S OK TO CRITICIZE THE PRESIDENT - HuffPollster: “Americans overwhelmingly agree it’s fine to criticize the president of the United States ― how fine, exactly, depends on which president they’re talking about. Sixty-three percent of respondents say it’s appropriate for Americans to publicly criticize the president of the United States, a new HuffPost/YouGov survey finds, with just 19 percent believing it’s inappropriate….Democrats say by a 55-point margin, 72 percent to 17 percent, that it’s appropriate to criticize Trump. They say the same of Obama by a much smaller 28-point margin, 59 percent to 31 percent. On the opposite side, Republicans say by a 52-point margin, 69 percent to 17 percent, that criticism of Obama is appropriate. They consider criticism of Trump appropriate by a smaller 23-point margin, 53 percent to 30 percent.” [HuffPost]MORE THAN A THIRD OF AMERICANS ARE STILL STRESSED OUT ABOUT THE ELECTION - HuffPollster: “Although the presidential election ended 71 days ago, more than 1 in 3 Americans continue to experience inner turmoil over the outcome. According to a new Washington Post-ABC News Poll, 35 percent of those polled say Trump’s election has increased their normal stress level. Only 12 percent say it has reduced their stress. The majority, 52 percent, say it’s made no difference. The groups most likely to say their stress has increased after the election include Democrats, Hillary Clinton supporters, Hispanics and people without a religious affiliation.” [HuffPost]HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!

Most attendees who spoke with The Huffington Post said they took the president’s words to heart, saying that they planned to organize and stand up for their rights during Donald Trump’s presidency.“When I was first hit with the despair of the results of the election, I immediately thought, when I’ve had times in my life when I’ve had similar despair, the thing that got me through that was to take action ― to take positive action every single day,” said Maria Illingworth, a Virginia artist who brought her two young daughters.Illingworth wasted no time after the election. She immediately signed up to work at a domestic violence women’s shelter and volunteered for a Meals on Wheels program to help take care of the elderly ― groups she said she believed wouldn’t “thrive” during Trump’s presidency.“Yesterday, I spent an evening with the Democrats of Arlington County,” she added, who were hoping to combat impressive Republican gains across local and state party offices across the country.“Thanks, Obama” was the brainchild of Bejidé Davis, a 29-year-old attorney in New York City, who wanted to express her gratitude to the president with a friendly gesture ― a “clap out.” After last year’s Democratic National Convention, Davis created a public Facebook event hoping to draw some of her friends. By the election, tens of thousands of people indicated they wanted to attend. “It really started to resonate with people: ‘This is more important now than ever, we have to thank him while we can,’” Davis told The Washington Post last week.More than 700 people gathered Thursday at the Arena Stage theater to give Obama one final thanks. They wore “Thanks, Obama” T-shirts and Obama campaign pins, hats and stickers. Many wrote notes of appreciation on a “thank you” wall set up by organizers, crediting the president for his example as a good father and his work on issues such as LGBTQ rights. On social media, many used the hashtag #ThanksObama to express their appreciation. A Snapchat “geo-filter” was also set up for people to share photos with their friends.At one point, a Hawaiian dance took place in honor of Obama’s birthplace. The band also played Bob Marley’s song “No Woman, No Cry,” but incorporated the lyrics “No Obama, No Cry” instead.At 7 p.m., Davis led the crowd in a sustained and thunderous standing ovation in honor of the president. The clap-out was streamed live on Facebook, Instagram and Periscope to users across the country.Rose Amolo, a consultant who immigrated to the country from Kenya, said she didn’t believe America would see another president like Obama. She added that she would heed the president’s parting message.“I’m not sitting on the sidelines,” she said, explaining that she intends to become involved in advocacy groups focused on protecting women’s reproductive health rights. The president’s words didn’t inspire everyone to action, however. A young woman who identified herself only as “Sam” said she appreciated the “science nerd” in Obama. As a professional working in the medical research field, Sam described the president as a kindred spirit. In coming years, she said, she would focus on being “a very rational voice to the forefront of different conversations, particularly in science, to make sure rational voices aren’t squashed.”But Sam said she probably wouldn’t engage in the kind of action the president described ― the same kind of energy and organizing Democrats will need from young people if they are to regain their political footing. “It’s just not what I usually choose to do,” she said. “I don’t like convincing people of my opinion. I don’t like putting my opinion on other people, I guess.”"

She will soon get to leave jail, although she won’t be going home.On Friday, Trumbull County Juvenile Court Judge Pamela Rintala said Bresha, 15, will be transferred to an adolescent treatment facility for a mental health evaluation. Bresha’s lawyer, Ian Friedman, said that the transfer would happen “very soon,” and that he was pleased with the decision.“I think this will be good for her, and instrumental in bringing this case to a conclusion,” he said.A trial date was set for May 22, where Bresha will face a charge of aggravated murder. She has pleaded “not true,” which is equivalent to a not-guilty plea.The courtroom was packed with Bresha’s supporters and family members, many wearing bright purple shirts with #StandWithBresha printed on them. Her older sister, Brianna, handed out tissues as they awaited the judge’s decision.While many of her family members said they wanted her home as soon as possible, they expressed optimism that she will be out of jail and able to access mental health care.“I’m ecstatic because she’s going to finally get the help she needs,” said her mother, Brandi Meadows. “It’s gotta be a better place; she will finally start healing.”Scant details are known about the events immediately preceding the fatal July 28 shooting, when police say Bresha shot her father, 41-year-old Jonathan Meadows, in his sleep. But Bresha’s mother has plainly stated what she believes drove her daughter to pick up a gun: She was trying to save the rest of them from his abuse. “She is my hero,” she said in an interview with Fox 8 Cleveland days after her husband’s death, describing him as a violent and controlling man who terrorized his family. “I wasn’t strong enough to get out and she helped us all.”Jonathan Meadows’ family has denied that the killing had anything to do with abuse, and opposed Bresha’s release from custody. Bresha’s case has garnered national attention, with anti-domestic violence and criminal justice reform advocates rallying to her side under the #FreeBresha campaign. They say her case is an example of the justice system punishing black girls and women for protecting themselves from abuse, and have compared her to Marissa Alexander, a Florida woman who was originally sentenced to 20 years in prison for firing a warning shot at her abusive husband. In a statement released after Friday’s hearing, the #FreeBresha campaign said it was unjust to continue to detain Bresha, and called on prosecutors to drop the charges against her.“Short of this, she should at least be released from all forms of detention while awaiting trial,” they wrote. “Bresha is a traumatized child survivor of domestic violence and her trauma has been compounded by her jailing for 175 days and counting.”Over 26,000 people have signed a petition calling on Trumbull County prosecutors to drop the charges against Bresha and release her immediately.Friedman said his office has received hundreds of books for Bresha and she gets letters from supporters daily. “It’s easy for a person who is incarcerated to feel disconnected from the world and to lose hope,” he told The Huffington Post on Wednesday during an interview at his Cleveland law office. “Here, people from around the world have made sure to let her know that she’s not forgotten.”In December, prosecutors announced that they would not try her as an adult, removing the threat of a life sentence if convicted. If Bresha is found guilty of aggravated murder in juvenile court, she can only be held until she turns 21. She would also remain in a juvenile facility for the remainder of her sentence. Friedman maintains his client was acting in self-defense to protect herself and her family. “A 14-year-old was put into an impossible situation,” he said. “She witnessed a lot of hardcore abuse against her mom. That’s no way for anyone to grow up, and there was no end in sight.” Brandi Meadows reported her husband’s alleged abuse to authorities on at least one occasion, according to court records and police reports obtained by HuffPost. In July 2011, she told Warren police that her husband was physically abusive, and that he threatened to kill her and their three children. (Bresha also has an older brother, Jonathan Jr.) She described him as being “capable of extreme violence,” and said she had been planning on leaving for weeks, but only recently got the courage after her kids’ lives were threatened. Three days later, she filed a domestic violence order of protection, writing that she was afraid for her life.“In the 17 years of our marriage he has cut me, broke my ribs, fingers, the blood vessels in my hand, my mouth, blackened my eyes. I believe my nose was broken,” she wrote. “If he finds us, I am 100 percent sure he will kill me and the children.” The protection order was voluntarily dismissed two months later, and the couple got back together. “He made me drop it,’’ she told Cleveland.com. Kathleen Heide, a professor at the University of South Florida and author of Understanding Parricide: When Sons and Daughters Kill Parents, said it’s common for children who kill a parent to have been severely abused or to have witnessed extreme violence in the home. “These are kids who’ve endured years of abuse, they’ve tried to get away, they may have attempted or thought about suicide, and they’ve enlisted the help of others, often to no avail,” she said. “They get to a point where they are either terrified and they react accordingly to protect themselves or others, or they get so desperate because they think there is no other way to end the abuse.” Kids who grow up around domestic violence have higher rates of depression, anxiety and suicide attempts, and the trauma can even affect a child’s developing brain, experts say. Martina Latessa, Bresha’s aunt and a Cleveland police officer, said Bresha ran away from home twice in the months before the shooting. She was scared that her dad would kill the whole family, Latessa said, and begged her for help. “The nightmare she was born into had a profound impact on her, to the point where she was suicidal,” she told HuffPost in an earlier interview. “Every single wall had to be collapsing in on her at that moment for her to do what she did.”Bresha’s next pretrial hearing is scheduled for April 17.

All were asked about Trump’s fondness for social media ― which he’s used to call reporters “sick” and “stupid,” slam celebrities as “over-rated” and blast opponents as “liars” and “lightweights.”While Ivanka said that, at times, she has called him on his Twitter use (“I’m his daughter, so I give him my feedback, solicited or otherwise”), her brothers said the tweets could be a good thing that can cut through “deceptive” media coverage.“I see how bad the media can be. I see how deceptive they can be, and if he can get his message directly to the source by cutting out the middleman, I think that’s a great thing,” Eric Trump told ABC’s Elizabeth Vargas.Vargas continued to ask about criticism Trump has faced for his unbridled use of Twitter, to which Eric had a simple answer: “Sometimes he’s right, in all fairness.”Those sentiments were echoed by his older brother, Donald Trump Jr., who said he expects a President Trump to “pull back on some of it” but not to end his policy of sidestepping traditional media.“I think if stuff and misinformation is put out there, he’s going to call them out, as he should,” Donald Jr. said. “They’re going to have to get used to it.”Watch highlights from the interview below."

But selling it means they have to endure harassment and verbal abuse from their customers.JUBA, South Sudan – Every few weeks, Mary stands in line alongside thousands of other displaced people at the United Nations Protection of Civilians Camp in the South Sudanese capital of Juba, hoping aid workers will hand out enough food for her to take home a small share.On a bad day, the 30-year-old mother of six returns to her tent empty-handed. On a good one, she heads home with her scant food supply – two small containers of sorghum grain, one small bottle of cooking oil and one cup of salt – and promptly divides it in two.She sets one half aside, knowing she will need to ration it out to cook a watery porridge for her children once a day for as long as the sorghum can last. But the other half she wraps up and takes to the market in the middle of the camp, where she sells it for 50 South Sudanese pounds, or less than $1. That gives her just enough to buy one small bag of sugar, a key ingredient in siko, the spirit she distills and sells in secret from her tent.“I have no other opportunity, there is nothing else,” she says, as she breastfeeds her young daughter in front of her makeshift home. “We are starving.”Like most residents of the camp where she lives, Mary belongs to the Nuer ethnic group. Born in the northern town of Leer in Unity State, she moved to Juba to search for work before South Sudan’s civil war broke out in December 2013. The conflict, sparked by political infighting between former vice president Riek Machar, a Nuer, and President Salva Kiir, a Dinka, quickly spiraled into raging ethnic violence.Tens of thousands of civilians fled to U.N. camps for protection, and years later, the camp in Juba is still overflowing with those who do not feel safe enough to return home. Although Machar and Kiir signed a peace deal in August 2015 and briefly installed a unity government in April 2016, their troops opened fire on each other again three months later. Government forces then bombed the rebel camp where Machar was staying in the capital, forcing him to flee the country.Since the start of the conflict, troops loyal to both Machar and Kiir have carried out horrific atrocities against civilians, including rape and mass murder, leaving more than 50,000 people dead. Mary’s husband joined the opposition fighters early on in the conflict, and was soon killed by Kiir’s forces, leaving her to raise their children on her own.The moonshine that Mary makes to survive is illegal in certain communities in South Sudan, including in the U.N. camps. Made with dates and sugar, it was far more popular before South Sudan’s independence from Sudan, when alcohol was illegal under Khartoum’s Sharia law. But it’s also highly alcoholic, so those who drink it have a higher risk of liver damage than with factory-produced spirits and they get drunk faster. Fearing the consumption of siko could prompt dangerous behavior in the camps, U.N. police patrol the muddy lanes between the tents and try to stop women from selling it.But with no hope of returning home any time soon, Mary feels she has no choice but to sell her limited food rations to be able to make the alcohol, which earns her around $2 a day. Then she can spend the extra cash on vegetables, soap and other necessities that are otherwise hard to come by in the camp.“I have no other opportunity, nothing else at all,” she says. “I only want to go home when the situation is more secure.”Gany Machar, a displaced civilian who serves as chairman of the camp where Mary lives, says residents there are lucky if they even get a food handout at all. “There are a huge number of people who do not even have ration cards and who do not get food,” he says. Some 4.8 million people across the country are in emergency or crisis levels of food insecurity, according to a recent World Food Program (WFP) report.But even those who manage to get food from the WFP and other agencies say what little they receive is not enough to survive. Nicola, 30, lives in a tent just a short walk from Mary’s. The first few months after she moved into the camp in 2014, she would often try to pick up her food ration only to find that supplies had already run out.Originally from the town of Bor, north of Juba, Nicola, like Mary, also lost her husband as he was fighting for the opposition. His death left her with four children to support on her own, and she says that as food shortages continued, she feared for her children’s lives. So she, too, started divvying up what little she had so that she could buy supplies to make siko out of her tent. She now earns around 10 South Sudanese pounds, or 15 cents, a day. But with the extra money comes a dangerous dilemma: The men she sells to often come back at night, drunk, putting her and her children at risk.“When they drink, they come back to bother me, and I have to call for help from my neighbors,” she says.It’s not just in the camps that women are turning to moonshine to make ends meet. The economic situation in other parts of Juba is getting increasingly desperate, and many South Sudanese women are distilling siko in their backyards to earn additional income. Oyella William, 41, grew up in South Sudan’s Eastern Equatoria state, near the Ugandan border. She married her husband when she was only 15, and they had 14 children – 10 are still alive and eight of those are still in school. Her husband grinds sorghum grain at a nearby store, and money is tight.In 2009, William began setting aside small amounts of change from her market expenses until she could afford to buy a large vat that allows her to distill a few days’ supply of moonshine at once. Each batch costs her around 300 South Sudanese pounds ($6) to make, and she sells enough to turn a profit of 1,625 pounds ($20) a week, thanks in large part to a group of regulars who spend all day sitting on a smattering of plastic chairs in her yard and drinking. They have more money to spend than the men living in the U.N. camps, so William earns a bigger profit than Nicola or Mary. But as the day wears on, the men she sells to usually descend into belligerence.“They insult me. They say they are the ones who help me and that without their money I would not be able to do anything,” William says. That doesn’t bother her husband, who often isn’t home to witness her or their young daughters being heckled by the drunken men who linger around their yard. He’s just happy to have the extra cash.As for William? “I keep quiet,” she says. “It’s work.”This article originally appeared on Women & Girls Hub.

12,THE WORLDPOST,The View From Moscow: How The Russian Media Covers Trump,Nick Robins-Early,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/russia-media-putin-trump_us_58812eafe4b096b4a230b3cf,An independent Russian journalist says the new U.S. president has a lot in common with Vladimir Putin.,2017-01-20,"Pedestrians cross the street behind a billboard showing a pictures of US president-elect Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Danilovgrad, Montenegro, November 16. 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5881307a1700002e00fdf9d9.jpeg?cache=89WMk15cEy&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump’s first news conference as president-elect last week featured a mix of deflected questions, cheering supporters and accusations CNN is “fake news.” The circus atmosphere was strange for many viewers and reporters, accustomed to more formality and respect. For some Russians, however, Trump’s go with the press was oddly familiar. One Russian journalist, Alexey Kovalev, captured that feeling in a widely syndicated post on Medium that lays out similarities between Trump’s treatment of the press last week and Russian President Vladimir Putin’s massive annual press conferences. Kovalev is the founder of fact-checking site Noodle Remover and a former senior editor at Russia’s largest state-sponsored news agency RIA Novosti, which Putin shuttered in December 2013.The Huffington Post spoke with Kovalev on sentiments toward the press shared by Trump and Putin, and what Russia’s pundits are saying about the new American president.Trump’s press conference struck a familiar chord with a lot of Russians for its similarities to Putin’s annual presser. Why do you think it felt so immediately recognizable? I wouldn’t say Russians in general, because, as I found out this year, the farther you go from Moscow, the less people care about Putin’s press conferences. But to anyone who has ever been in that [press conference] room or watched it on a live feed from the conference center in Moscow, several things instantly jumped out.The way that Trump shut down a reporter, for instance ― Putin used to lash out at reporters like that while he was still, in a way, green. There are some subjects that really freak him out, and seasoned reporters know that there are several areas that are no-go.What’s an example of that?His family. Once a reporter was careless enough in 2009 to ask a question about his alleged affair with a famous gymnast and he really lashed out. So he does share these hostilities towards the press with Trump, but the difference of course is that the media in Russia are much more subdued and controlled than in the United States.Unless Donald Trump somehow manages to completely dismantle the foundations of democracy, like the First Amendment, I don’t think it will come to the point where the media is in a really dire situation like in Russia. Russian media outlets and newsrooms have faced closures and restrictions in the past number of years. What’s the climate like right now in Russia for independent journalism?Well, one thing that you need to know about journalism in Russia is that on paper, we are also protected by the Russian constitution.

RT’s coverage of the presidential campaign, I can definitely say they were not campaigning for Trump. They were quite vocally anti-Clinton. If you look closely at the coverage, you’ll see they had a soft spot for Bernie Sanders and had an exclusive interview with him.As far as domestic coverage is concerned, it was insanely anti-Clinton and anti-Obama. There’s so much bizarre hatred and really racist insults thrown at Obama in Russian TV coverage. There’s so much confusion now [about Trump], because no one really knows what to think.There isn’t an official line on it yet?Yeah, and I can see the gears turning in the talking heads on TV.For instance, when Rex Tillerson was doing his congressional hearing, it was just assumed that Tillerson was our guy. We gave him an Order of Friendship, he should be on our side. Then Tillerson said something to the effect of “sanctions should have been tougher on Russia and Russia had no right to annex Crimea” and there was a lot of confusion, like, “How could this happen?

But it’s almost like they don’t really believe that, because really no one knows what to expect. There’s a lot of confusion, but domestic coverage is definitely so sympathetic to Donald Trump that it’s getting bizarre.In terms of Trump’s relationship with Putin, in a lot of American media coverage, he’s in the pocket of Putin or being played by Putin.

13,THE WORLDPOST,The View From Moscow: How The Russian Media Covers Trump,Nick Robins-Early,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/russia-media-putin-trump_us_58812eafe4b096b4a230b3cf,An independent Russian journalist says the new U.S. president has a lot in common with Vladimir Putin.,2017-01-20,"Journalists at an annual news conference by Russia's President Vladimir Putin. The yearly event features over a thousand journalists clamoring to ask a question, some bringing signs to draw attention to themselves.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58813aa31700002e00fdf9f6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump’s first news conference as president-elect last week featured a mix of deflected questions, cheering supporters and accusations CNN is “fake news.” The circus atmosphere was strange for many viewers and reporters, accustomed to more formality and respect. For some Russians, however, Trump’s go with the press was oddly familiar. One Russian journalist, Alexey Kovalev, captured that feeling in a widely syndicated post on Medium that lays out similarities between Trump’s treatment of the press last week and Russian President Vladimir Putin’s massive annual press conferences. Kovalev is the founder of fact-checking site Noodle Remover and a former senior editor at Russia’s largest state-sponsored news agency RIA Novosti, which Putin shuttered in December 2013.The Huffington Post spoke with Kovalev on sentiments toward the press shared by Trump and Putin, and what Russia’s pundits are saying about the new American president.Trump’s press conference struck a familiar chord with a lot of Russians for its similarities to Putin’s annual presser. Why do you think it felt so immediately recognizable? I wouldn’t say Russians in general, because, as I found out this year, the farther you go from Moscow, the less people care about Putin’s press conferences. But to anyone who has ever been in that [press conference] room or watched it on a live feed from the conference center in Moscow, several things instantly jumped out.The way that Trump shut down a reporter, for instance ― Putin used to lash out at reporters like that while he was still, in a way, green. There are some subjects that really freak him out, and seasoned reporters know that there are several areas that are no-go.What’s an example of that?His family. Once a reporter was careless enough in 2009 to ask a question about his alleged affair with a famous gymnast and he really lashed out. So he does share these hostilities towards the press with Trump, but the difference of course is that the media in Russia are much more subdued and controlled than in the United States.Unless Donald Trump somehow manages to completely dismantle the foundations of democracy, like the First Amendment, I don’t think it will come to the point where the media is in a really dire situation like in Russia. Russian media outlets and newsrooms have faced closures and restrictions in the past number of years. What’s the climate like right now in Russia for independent journalism?Well, one thing that you need to know about journalism in Russia is that on paper, we are also protected by the Russian constitution. But unlike the United States, there aren’t any checks and balances to keep that in place. It works on paper, it exists on paper, but there are millions of ways to humiliate or threaten a publication without resorting to unconstitutional measures.

Another massive expansion has left just 12 miles of ice holding a Delaware-sized iceberg from breaking off the continent.Researchers with Project MIDAS, a British initiative to track the effects of climate change on the Larsen C shelf, said on Thursday that the crack grew an additional 6 miles in the first three weeks of January, based on recent satellite images. The ice shelf is the northernmost major ice sheet in Antarctica.“When it calves, the Larsen C Ice Shelf will lose more than 10% of its area to leave the ice front at its most retreated position ever recorded,” Adrian Luckman, the lead researcher behind the MIDAS Project, said in a post. “This event will fundamentally change the landscape of the Antarctic Peninsula.”While the calving of the ice shelf wouldn’t directly contribute to sea level rise (the ice is already floating on top of the water, like ice in a glass), scientists say the collapse could trigger the melting of land ice the Larsen C is currently holding back.Luckman previously told the BBC he’d be “amazed” if the ice shelf didn’t break away in the next few months, saying: “It’s so close to calving that I think it’s inevitable.”While he noted such predictions are hard to make, in an interview this week he told the outlet the rapid expansion of the crack may portend a quick demise for the section of the shelf, which would create one of the largest icebergs in recorded history.“My feeling is that this new development suggests something will happen within weeks to months, but there is an outside chance that further growth will be slow for longer than that,” Luckman said.Two sister ice shelfs in the region, the Larsen A and Larsen B, have already been cleaved from Antarctica in dramatic fashion, in 1995 and 2002, respectively. The Larsen B’s demise was captured in a spectacular video released by NASA that shows the sheet disintegrating into the ocean."

Lazurus is often compared to his neighbor, a “rich man” who lived in the lap of luxury on earth, but who was sent to Hades after death.“At a time when our human family is beset by grave humanitarian crises demanding far-sighted and united political responses, I pray that your decisions will be guided by the rich spiritual and ethical values that have shaped the history of the American people and your nation’s commitment to the advancement of human dignity and freedom worldwide,” the pope wrote in the telegram.It’s become customary for popes to send good wishes to incoming presidents of the United States. Both Pope Benedict XVI and Saint John Paul II have sent these short messages in the past encouraging former presidents to care for the poor and outcast. The relationship between Francis and Trump, a professed Presbyterian, has been rocky in the past. Trump has long promised to build a wall on America’s southern border, an idea that Francis has harshly criticized.“A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian,” Francis told a reporter when asked about Trump in February.True to form, Trump condemned the pope’s remarks. He went on to claim that the Mexican government was using the pope as a pawn.“For a religious leader to question a person’s faith is disgraceful,” Mr. Trump said."

The move will increase costs for 750,000 to 850,000 Americans in the next year alone, according to the National Association of Realtors.The Obama administration had said last week that the Federal Housing Administration would drop the cost of mortgage insurance it sells by almost a third to 0.60 percent. But after Trump took office, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which oversees the FHA, told lenders the fee cut was off. The reversal of the reduction will mean that homebuyers who borrow $200,000 under the program will see their mortgage insurance fees go up by $500 a year relative to what the Obama administration had ordered, according to figures released by the FHA when the cut was announced. The reduction was intended to help partially offset the cost of rising mortgage rates and was scheduled to go into effect on Jan. 27. The government sells the insurance in case borrowers default.The mortgage industry’s main lobby group said when the cut was announced that it looked forward to working with the new administration on the issue. Congressional Republicans attacked the move, saying it would cut into the reserves the FHA held against defaults.Julian Castro, Obama’s HUD secretary, said when the fee cut was announced that the FHA’s reserve fund had grown by $44 billion in the last four years and that it was time to share these gains with borrowers. Ben Carson, Trump’s nominee to run HUD, said in his confirmation hearing that he supported undoing the fee cut, and lending trade publications reported that a reversal was likely.“We’re disappointed in the decision but will continue making the case to reinstate the cut in the months ahead,” Bill Brown, the president of the National Association of Realtors, said in a statement to The Huffington Post.A spokesman for the National Association of Home Builders told HuffPost that it opposes canceling the reduction and it “will work with the Trump team” on the issue. “We feel confident that they will reinstate the reduction,” the spokesman said.Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

19,POLITICS,Trump's Inaugural Speech Sounded More Like A Takeover,Howard Fineman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-inaugural-speech_us_588273b3e4b096b4a231a7ad,"Friday was a triumphant day for the new president -- but you wouldn't know it from his angry, conspiratorial address.",2017-01-20,"A policeman stands guard during the televised inauguration of Donald Trump as the 45th president of the United States, Jan. 20, 2017, in New York City.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/588277d61200002d00ad8d2f.jpeg?cache=30n5lJ27W1&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Forgive me, but I love presidential inaugurations.Covering politics and adoring America ― especially our Constitution ― I relish the pageantry of the law-based transition of power, even if I know that we are still not a perfect union.I have covered many inaugurations, and they’ve shared certain reassuring characteristics. The speech allows each new president to start things off on a peaceable note, however urgent the tasks at hand. It’s a chance to pay homage to the constitutional process, to acknowledge those who may not have supported the incoming president during the campaign, to offer soothing words about the durability of freedom.And for the better part of a century, the inaugural speech has allowed new presidents to reaffirm our faith in an active global alliance of free nations for the spread of humanistic values.Well, President Donald J. Trump’s speech offered almost none of that.No one like him has ever been elected, so in one sense, this departure from the norm wasn’t surprising.At the same time, it was a shocking thing to hear and see and feel from a couple hundred feet below the podium.First, the urgency and the anger. Ronald Reagan came to town in 1981 with a good bit of the same attitude. But it wasn’t nearly as pure or simplistic as what Trump expressed in his jeremiad Friday.When Reagan was inaugurated, he made sure to stress that he wasn’t against government per se, or even against Washington, D.C. Rather, he said, he was against wastefulness.Trump, on the other hand, made it personal, even if he didn’t mention any names. And he made ominous allusions that called to mind old European tropes.“For too long,” he said, “a small group in our nation’s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost.”Who is this “small group?” Does he mean Congress? The wider federal bureaucracy? The K Street lobby corps? The press?Maybe he was talking about the whole churning machine of Washington itself. But something that vast wouldn’t seem to fit the devil-in-hiding liturgy of Trump’s more conspiratorial, xenophobic supporters, led by White House counselor Steve Bannon.Trump’s vehement tone was all the more striking given the relatively small turnout for the event on the Mall ― which was nowhere near as crowded as it had been for some past inaugurations ― and the genial, unthreatening mood of many of his supporters in seats beneath the Capitol’s West Front.Tony Ledbetter, for example, was a Trump elector in Florida, but he’s also a county chair with roots in the Reagan campaign of 1980. A practiced politician, he begged off comparing Trump to his original hero, saying his main hope for the new president is simply that he “create jobs.”Presidents tend not to talk about themselves very much in their inaugural speeches. But Trump, as usual, departed from tradition, and did so in the dramatic, passionate tones of a revolutionary leader.“I will fight for you with every breath in my body,” he declared, “and I will never let you down.”At times, the anti-Washington populism of Trump’s speech ― he indicted much of the very system that had just installed him ― made his predecessors, even Reagan, seem like go-along, get-along types.“The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer,” he said.There was the pitchman’s urgency to it all, with little stately, secular sermonizing. “The time for empty talk is over,” he said. “Now arrives the hour of action.”The language throughout was nakedly combative, even bloody. Of drugs and violence, he vowed, “This American carnage stops right here and it stops right now.”The wealth of the middle class has been “ripped from their homes,” he said. Americans will be able to watch their country “eradicate from the face of the earth” every shred of “radical Islamic terrorism.” All of us, he said, citing an old military slogan, “bleed the same red blood of patriots.”In fact, rather than simply nodding to the idea of patriotism and love of country, Trump made it the central feature of his vision.“At the bedrock of our politics,” he said, “will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.”And to underscore the centrality of patriotism, he said that he was “issuing a new decree” in the name of the “people assembled here today.”“From this day forward, it’s going to be only America first,” he said. “America first.”The cries of protests wafting up to the West Front added to the sense that a hostile takeover was underway.As inherently American as presidential inaugurations are, no modern president has ever made patriotism per se the central feature of his message.There are two reasons for that. One is that the United States has, since World War II, been part of a global alliance of nations standing for values that are American but that transcend any one nation.The other reason is that the president, in the oath of office, doesn’t declare allegiance to the United States, its people or its borders. Rather, the oath is a vow to “preserve, protect and defend the Constitution.”The Constitution, not the president, is the boss in America, and it cannot be fired.But unless I missed something in his abattoir of an address, Trump did not mention on Friday who the real boss is.

20,HEALTHY LIVING,The Women Who Are Running To Protest Trump Are Tapping Into History,Erin Schumaker,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/women-running-to-protest-trump_us_587cff8de4b0e58057ffafb5,There is a long tradition of women running as a form of protest.,2017-01-20,"Alison Désir (in yellow) runs part of the 240-mile relay from Harlem New York City, to Washington D.C., that she organized to raise money for Planned Parenthood, January 19, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5881388d1200002d00ad89a1.jpeg?cache=LJvVFtnIZe&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In the wake of President Donald Trump’s electoral victory, Alison Désir, the founder of a community running organization in New York City called Harlem Run, turned her frustration into political action.Désir’s remedy: a four-woman, 240-mile relay, beginning in Harlem, New York City, on Jan. 16 and ending in Washington, D.C., on the day of Trump’s inauguration. The race was designed to raise money and awareness for Planned Parenthood in honor of women. As of Jan. 20, the (Four Women) Run For ALL Women GoFundMe page had raised more than $89,000 ― more than twice their goal ― to give women access to cancer screenings and preventive care, even if Planned Parenthood is defunded this year.Though Four Women are running specifically in opposition to Trump, they are participating in a legacy of people who run in protest or with advocacy in mind.Protest and advocacy runs range from sponsored marathons to singular, public displays of support, such as Terry Fox’s famous 143-day marathon for cancer research or the recent 2,000-mile relay run from North Dakota to Washington, D.C. to protest the Dakota Access Pipeline.Désir’s activist relay is part of a larger tradition of running as a form of protest. Women in particular have a history of using long-distance running to call attention to their fight for equality. In fact, just the act of running while female used to be protest enough.When Roberta “Bobbi” Gibb’s 1966 Boston Marathon entry was rejected by the Boston Athletic Association because women were neither allowed to participate, nor “physiologically able” to compete, she ignored her denial letter. Instead, she dressed in her brother’s clothing, hid her hair under a hooded sweatshirt, and joined the race without a bib. Gibb would go on to prove her detractors at the Boston Athletic Association wrong. She finished in the top third of the pack.“Last week a tidy-looking and pretty 23-year-old blonde [had] a performance that should do much to phase out the old-fashioned notion that a female is too frail for distance running,” Sports Illustrated wrote at the time.Her protest run also inspired other women to participate, most memorably at that time 20-year-old Kathy Switzer, who officially entered the Boston marathon under the non-gender specific name “K.V. Switzer” the following year. Remarkable though her physical achievement was, race director Jock Semple tried to tackle Switzer and toss her from the race for entering under false pretenses (as seen in the photo above snapped during the assault). As Switzer writes on her website:A big man, a huge man, with bared teeth was set to pounce, and before I could react he grabbed my shoulder and flung me back, screaming, “Get the hell out of my race and give me those numbers!” Then he swiped down my front, trying to rip off my bib number, just as I leapt backward from him.

Gone are sections like “Civil Rights” and “Reducing Gun Violence” and in are pages like “America First Energy Plan” and “America First Foreign Policy.”But people also quickly noticed that certain pages seemed to have disappeared altogether. Searches for LGBT turn up nothing and the section on climate change goes to a broken link. Advocacy groups for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer equality quickly condemned the Trump administration for scrubbing mentions of their community.There is a good chance that Trump’s WhiteHouse.gov will not have a specific section on LGBTQ rights. That’s not surprising, since it was not a focus of his campaign and he has spoken out against full equality. Same with climate change ― Trump has been skeptical of the human connection to global warming.That doesn’t necessarily mean, however, that that content is gone forever. The Trump administration is essentially building a new site from scratch ― even though it looks like the Obama administration’s WhiteHouse.gov ― and that means replacing the content bit by bit. “The transition of the site is in progress as updates are made,” Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said. And the glitches aren’t restricted to progressive priorities. A search for “China” for example, comes up with only a handful of results. The site for the Office of Management and Budget similarly is gone. The Obama White House content is also still accessible at a new site, ObamaWhiteHouse.Archives.Gov. As Kori Schulman, the Obama deputy chief digital officer explained in October, “Similar to the Clinton and Bush White House websites, President Obama’s WhiteHouse.gov will be preserved on the web and frozen after January 20th and made available at ObamaWhiteHouse.gov. The incoming White House will receive the WhiteHouse.gov domain and all content that has been posted to WhiteHouse.gov during the Obama administration will be archived with NARA [National Archives and Records Administration].”So far on Trump’s White House site, there are also no pages devoted to immigration or repealing Obamacare, which were two of Trump’s top priorities during the campaign.

Everett’s suit, however, is believed to be the first to specifically target the company for what it allegedly knew about illegal sales of the drug, according to the Los Angeles Times.“We know this is a bold action we are taking, but it is the right thing to do,” said Mayor Ray Stephanson. A Purdue statement issued to the Herald on the eve of the court action did not address specifics of the anticipated suit, but said the company “shares public officials’ concerns about the opioid crisis and we are committed to working collaboratively to find solutions.” The company characterized itself as an “industry leader in abuse deterrence.”Everett has been devastated by an epidemic of heroin addiction, which can often be triggered by opioid prescriptions or street sales. In 2010, following public pressure, Purdue changed its drug formula to make it more difficult to abuse. Several cities then saw a spike in heroin use and overdoses.“Millions of OxyContin pills went into the black market and created the crisis we’re facing today,” Hil Kaman, Everett’s public health and safety director, told KOMO-TV. Purdue “should be responsible financially for helping the city respond to the crisis that we’re hard at work addressing.”The suit was triggered in part by damaging information uncovered by the Los Angeles Times over the summer revealing that Purdue tracked illegal sales of its drug through suspected doctors and pharmacies for more than a decade, even locating the apparent headquarters of a suspected drug ring. Yet the company failed to notify law enforcement authorities until years after the ring had stopped operation, its leaders were under indictment, and some 1.1 million pills had already been pumped into the black market, the Times reported.

Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/climate-change-trump-white-house_us_58824c34e4b070d8cad2252d,Now it vows to stop Obama's climate plan and revive the coal industry.,2017-01-20,An EPA chart shows where U.S. greenhouse gases originate.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58825f1a170000fa01fdfd00.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The White House website has removed the page devoted to climate change action and posted newly sworn-in President Donald Trump’s pledge to undo environmental regulations and “revive America’s coal industry.” The 361-word policy outline on the new page, titled “America First Energy Plan,” makes no reference to global warming or climate change, except to note Trump’s commitment to “eliminating harmful and unnecessary policies such as the Climate Action Plan and the Waters of the U.S. rule.”The Climate Action Plan, which the Obama administration launched in 2013, set forth a strategy for slashing greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. The utility sector makes up the largest portion of the country’s carbon footprint, producing 30 percent of emissions, according to 2014 data from the Environmental Protection Agency. That’s because coal, by far the dirtiest-burning fossil fuel, once served as the country’s primary source of electricity.Republican-dominated states have sued to halt the Climate Action Plan, and last February the Supreme Court granted a stay on the rules until a lower court hears the case. Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, Trump’s nominee to head the EPA, led the charge to block the plan. With Trump now in the White House, Republican majorities in Congress and an open seat on the Supreme Court, the climate rules are in jeopardy. Trump, along with many Republican lawmakers, blames former President Barack Obama’s push to cut emissions for the virtual collapse of the coal industry over the past decade. But the domestic coal industry was already on the decline before the Clean Power Plan. The U.S. coal industry has struggled for several reasons, including the risky bet many companies made on the future of coal consumption in China. While China still uses enormous amounts of coal, it has dramatically curbed its consumption over the last few years as it invests heavily in renewable energy.The U.S. natural gas boom likely sealed the domestic coal industry’s fate, as the less-polluting fuel became cheaper. In 2001, just 17.1 percent of U.S. electricity came from natural gas generation. By 2014, the share from natural gas had increased to 27.4 percent. Now it is tied with coal at 33 percent. Trump’s pick for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, previously led a company that vowed to eat coal’s lunch with its natural gas business. Exxon Mobil has showed no signs that it plans to cut back on natural gas production. “Sound energy policy begins with the recognition that we have vast untapped domestic energy reserves right here in America,” the new White House website reads. “The Trump Administration will embrace the shale oil and gas revolution to bring jobs and prosperity to millions of Americans.”The new president’s energy plan ― to the extent it’s explained on the website ― seems to signal a shift away from renewable energy sources, which flourished under Obama. Trump, who has called climate change “a hoax,” has also stacked his Cabinet with fossil fuel allies who, even if they acknowledge that the planet is warming, question the overwhelming scientific evidence that puts the blame on carbon emissions. “Less expensive energy will be a big boost to American agriculture, as well,” says the new White House site. “The Trump Administration is also committed to clean coal technology, and to reviving America’s coal industry, which has been hurting for too long.”The White House website for the Council on Environmental Quality, which was founded in 1969, also disappeared on Friday afternoon.Study after study shows the planet began rapidly warming as the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere soared in response to humans burning coal, oil and gas on an industrial scale. Separate analyses from two federal agencies released Wednesday show that 2016 was the hottest year on record.“Minutes after he was sworn in, any illusion that Trump would act in the best interests of families in this country as President were wiped away by a statement of priorities that constitute an historic mistake on one of the key crises facing our planet and an assault on public health,” Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune said in a statement. “This is a shameful and dark start to Trump’s Presidency, and a slap in the face to any American who thought Trump might pursue the national interest.”How Trump might actually ease coal’s pain is unclear. Even coal magnate Robert Murray said in 2014, “If you think it’s coming back ... you’re smoking dope.”This article has been updated with information about the CEQ website.

The truth is a number of them implicitly acknowledged there were problems and proposed substantive reforms to prevent them from happening again.New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Ray Buckley, who cherishes his status as the field’s process wonk, had some of the most detailed recommendations.“This is really my wheel well. This is what I am very passionate about,” he said.Buckley has a proposal to ensure that a state’s primary or caucus vote reflects the wishes of its voters, regardless of which candidate the state’s superdelegates get behind. Currently the superdelegates are party insiders free to support a primary candidate regardless of who their state’s voters backed.He would also make sure that scheduling candidate debates is up to the DNC’s executive committee, rather than just the chair, and bar the party from making a joint fundraising agreement with a particular primary candidate.Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) said he agreed with the recommendations and added that he would “set a cultural tone that is absolutely respectful of everyone who is running.”“We have got to communicate to every staff member that what you write in an email could well end up being a headline. And so you have got to be scrupulously fair to everyone because you might not think anyone is watching, but probably someone is,” he said.Under normal circumstances it would be odd for DNC chair candidates to be discussing the intricacies of the presidential primary process when the contest is still at least 2½ years away.This DNC race comes months after not only a crushing election defeat but also a fractious Democratic primary replete with accusations of foul play hurled at the DNC and its then-chair, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.). And while the seven contenders onstage were loath to admit it, that primary casts a giant shadow over the contest to lead the party.Every one of the changes Buckley and Ellison put forward at the debate is a direct response to a specific instance of real or perceived DNC interference.Clinton’s Democratic primary race rivals, including Sanders and Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, accused the DNC of deliberately limiting the number of debates and scheduling several for the weekends to aid Clinton, as well as allowing illegally high campaign donations to Clinton through their joint fundraising apparatus.Leaked emails from DNC staffers indeed became headlines, as Ellison hinted, because they revealed party staffers’ suggestions of potential attacks on Sanders and mockery of his candidacy.And the role of superdelegate came under fire during the contentious primary as never before because so many of them endorsed Clinton months before Democratic primary and caucus participants even got a chance to weigh in. Although they did not end up contradicting the popular vote, the notion that they could and the early prestige they lent the former secretary of state incurred major resentment among Sanders supporters.Buckley argued that he has the credibility to rebuild trust in the party’s impartiality, given his record in New Hampshire.As state party chair, he noted, he helped Sanders overcome early skepticism of his eligibility to participate in the primary, personally accompanying the Vermont independent to register for it at secretary of state’s office. He later testified for Sanders in a challenge of his inclusion on the ballot.“I’ve done it. I’ve shown what a fair party can do,” he concluded.The 447 voting DNC members will gather to elect their next chair in Atlanta on Feb. 25."

It was elegiac, I’d say,” one audience member, who was not identified, told Backstreets.The concert’s published set list included “Born in the USA,” “Thunder Road” and “The Promised Land.” Two of the songs, “Tougher Than the Rest” and “If I Should Fall Behind” featured Springsteen’s wife and fellow E Street Band member Patti Scialfa.The attendant described the event as different from any other Springsteen performance they had seen.“This one was a real personal thing, this thing for staff who sacrificed so much over the last eight years. It was a humble, quiet gesture from Bruce to say thanks to President Obama, the staff, and their families. No pomp, no ceremony, no press. Just the man, the guitar, and the songs.”Though there has been no public mention of the concert by The Boss, as of Thursday morning, he re-tweeted a story about it on his Twitter page.Springsteen has made several appearances at the White House during Obama’s two terms in office, including for his acceptance of the Presidential Medal of Freedom two months ago.During that emotional ceremony, the president credited the 20-time Grammy award winner’s music as the “anthems of our America, the reality of who we are and the reveries of who we want to be.”Unfortunately, last week’s performance may very well be his last White House attendance for a while.Springsteen has made his disgust of president-elect Donald Trump no secret, with the “Born to Run” singer having calling him a “flagrant, toxic narcissist” who’s willing to “take down the entire democratic system” if he fails.Even the E Street Band’s cover band, the B Street Band, has refused to play in Trump’s honor, having recently backed out of performing at an inaugural party.In contrast, B Street Band performed at both of the galas held for President Obama’s inaugurations, in 2009 and 2013. They said that they signed up to perform at this year’s before knowing who the president-elect would be.Once they did, they said they were bowing out, out of the ”respect and gratitude we have for Bruce and the E Street Band.”"

Just the man, the guitar, and the songs.”Though there has been no public mention of the concert by The Boss, as of Thursday morning, he re-tweeted a story about it on his Twitter page.Springsteen has made several appearances at the White House during Obama’s two terms in office, including for his acceptance of the Presidential Medal of Freedom two months ago.During that emotional ceremony, the president credited the 20-time Grammy award winner’s music as the “anthems of our America, the reality of who we are and the reveries of who we want to be.”Unfortunately, last week’s performance may very well be his last White House attendance for a while.Springsteen has made his disgust of president-elect Donald Trump no secret, with the “Born to Run” singer having calling him a “flagrant, toxic narcissist” who’s willing to “take down the entire democratic system” if he fails.Even the E Street Band’s cover band, the B Street Band, has refused to play in Trump’s honor, having recently backed out of performing at an inaugural party.In contrast, B Street Band performed at both of the galas held for President Obama’s inaugurations, in 2009 and 2013. They said that they signed up to perform at this year’s before knowing who the president-elect would be.Once they did, they said they were bowing out, out of the ”respect and gratitude we have for Bruce and the E Street Band.”"

What conflicts of interest?,2017-01-19,"A technician combs the hair of a waxwork of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at the Musee Grevin in Paris, Jan. 19, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58811b3b1700009f0a92b179.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― On the last day of Barack Obama’s presidency, hundreds of Republican National Committee members gathered at their annual winter meeting to elect a new leadership team and lay groundwork for the next campaign cycle.As Donald Trump arrived in the nation’s capital, hours away from assuming the most powerful office in the world, the GOP couldn’t resist spiking the football. “I’m not bragging about it just to brag,” said RNC chair Reince Priebus, after summing up the party’s impressive victories in 2016. “I say this because the RNC’s infrastructure was one of the most important cogs in the machine of victory this year.”“It is the Democratic Party,” added his deputy chief of staff, Katie Walsh, “that is second-guessing themselves, their data and their mechanics.”Thursday’s event, which was held a few miles from the White House, was largely a celebratory affair. The GOP had achieved what many had thought impossible after its stinging loss in the 2012 presidential election ― unified control of Washington and in many statehouses across the country. Jubilant party officials gathered to bid goodbye to Priebus, who will be Trump’s White House chief of staff, and to elect his successor, Ronna Romney McDaniel. The niece of former GOP nominee Mitt Romney is only the second woman to hold the position. In her acceptance speech, she vowed to make the party more inclusive and promised to end Democrats’ claim to “being the party of women.”In and around the halls of the Omni Shoreham Hotel, which hosted the meeting, nearly all RNC members who spoke with The Huffington Post expressed hope and optimism about Trump’s incoming administration. And they flatly dismissed concerns about his ties to Russia, his many conflicts of interest and the ethics problems plaguing several of his Cabinet nominees.America ought to give Trump a fair shake, they argued.“I just see it as a red herring, all these ethics conflicts and other problems that seem to be dragged up,” said Pennsylvania GOP chair Rob Gleason. “It’s just part of our country becoming so polarized. Give the man a chance.”The country remains in the dark about Trump’s finances. He has not made public his tax returns, and insists that he cannot do so because they are under audit. (In reality, there is nothing stopping him from releasing his tax returns.) Moreover, voters do not know how much money the businessman owes around the world. Nor do they know the extent of his business entanglements or the potential conflicts of interest that could arise as a result.The Office of Government Ethics earlier this month called Trump’s plan to address his business conflicts “meaningless.” OGE called on the president-elect to fully divest his assets before he assumes the presidency on Friday. Helen Van Etten, a GOP committeewoman from Kansas, said such concerns about Trump’s conflicts of interest ought to be viewed “in perspective.”“In general,” an ethical government is “always a good thing,” she said. “But did that apply in the past eight years? No.”Michigan GOP committeeman Rob Steele noted that the president is exempt from conflict-of-interest laws, as Trump himself has said. But the law does not mean it’s impossible for Trump, or anyone in his Cabinet, to have any conflicts of interest at all.“I think they firmly need to be vetted, to see if there’s something there or not,” Steele said, referring to Trump’s nominees.Few people at the event seemed worried about Trump’s uncontrollable nature or his tendency to break with Republicans on key issues. In recent weeks, for example, Trump has called for universal health insurance and dismissed the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as “obsolete.”“NATO is a policy thing, and he can have his opinion on NATO. I don’t think that’s necessarily divisive,” said Henry Barbour, a GOP committeeman from Louisiana.Others continued to insist that it’s just a matter of time before Trump moderates his behavior.“I think he’s got to get his sea legs. Like any other job, when you’re new to the job, I think it’s a learning experience,” said Dan Welch, a GOP committeeman from Nevada. “I think he’s doing a great job learning on the go right now. But it’s going to take a while.” "

Leaders at both Naseeha and NISA expect this upward trend to continue after his inauguration on Friday.Islamophobic rhetoric was a core part of Trump’s campaign. In the past, he’s floated the idea of banning Muslims from entering the country and even been open to the idea of registering American Muslims on a national database. He’s now surrounded himself with advisors who harbor prejudiced views of Islam.All of that has resulted in anxious calls to her organization, according to NISA helpline director Tanweer Ebrahim. NISA specifically provides free, confidential telephone counseling for Muslim women. In 2015, it reportedly received 3,579 calls. That number increased to about 4,500 in 2016. In particular, Ebrahim says she saw a 3 to 4 percent bump in calls after the election. “We have mothers fearing for the treatment of their children in school. And overall, they’re worried for the future of their children with a Trump presidency,” Ebrahim told NBC.Naseeha’s founder, Yaseen Poonah, said that calls to the youth hotline increased from 4,000 in 2015 to 16,000 in 2016. Many of those calls reportedly went unanswered because the organization is short-staffed ― a problem Poonah is attempting to fix by recruiting and training new volunteers. Poonah told The Star that the boost in call numbers could be a result of better word of mouth, advertising and success on Google search. But he also tied the uptick in calls to the U.S. election. Along with calling about issues that affect young people of all religions ― like depression and bullying ― it’s also becoming more common for Naseeha to receive calls about discrimination. “Youth are struggling with the sentiment that they don’t belong and that is manifesting itself in unhealthy behaviors,” he told The Star. “Admittedly, we are a little concerned about what will happen after Inauguration Day.” Ibrahim Hooper, National Communications Director for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR, told The Huffington Post that he wasn’t surprised that many of the calls were coming from American Muslims, whom he said have been feeling “stress and strain and apprehension” in the weeks leading up to the inauguration. “This just says we need to do more here in the U.S. to deal with these issues,” Hooper said. “Very often, we get so caught up in protecting civil rights and dealing with social justice issues, that people can fall through the cracks with their personal concerns.” Dr. Ben Herzig, a Massachusetts-based clinical psychologist, has often worked with Muslim clients. In an article for The Islamic Monthly, he described how some of his clients have reacted to the election results with “sadness, fear, disappointment, anger and nervousness.” While Islamophobia has never been a patient’s primary complaint, Herzig believes anti-Muslim political rhetoric has had a negative impact on his patients’ mental health. “American Muslims are fearful of policies that might target them under the incoming administration. The outcome of the election has generally exacerbated issues like depression and anxiety for American Muslims who had been suffering from them prior to the election,” Herzig told HuffPost in an email.But despite these fears about life under a Trump administration, Herzig said that another narrative is also emerging within the community ―a story of increasing civic engagement and resilience.“For Muslims with depression, anxiety and other challenges, the presidential election does not need to reinforce a personal narrative of victimhood or aloneness, but it also undeniably reflects the fact that, for nearly half of their fellow voting citizens, Trump’s anti-Muslim rhetoric was not disqualifying,” Herzig wrote. “My response as a psychologist involves validating that pain and being realistic about the obstacles ahead, but also emphasizing the idea that fear and despair can be the exception and not the rule.”"

It was just one of days when you don’t feel that great and the other player is really feeling the ball.

That’s not our concern, as long as it’s not done from Ecuadorian jurisdiction, violating our non-intervention policies,” Long added.Assange said on Twitter last week that he would submit to extradition to the U.S. if President Barack Obama granted clemency to Chelsea Manning, the soldier incarcerated since 2010 for leaking a trove of national security documents to Wikileaks. Obama on Tuesday announced he was commuting Manning’s sentence. But Assange backed down from his extradition offer.“This is well short of what he sought,” Assange’s U.S.-based attorney Barry Pollack told The Hill on Wednesday. “Mr. Assange had called for Chelsea Manning to receive clemency and be released immediately.”Assange’s activities at the embassy never jeopardized his asylum status, since Ecuador’s cutoff of his internet aimed to prevent a specific case of possible interference in American affairs, Long said.Likewise, U.S. intelligence agencies’ post-election conclusion that Wikileaks published emails hacked by the Russian government also has no impact on Ecuador’s treatment of Assange, Long said.“This is a bilateral issue between Russia and the United States. It has nothing to do with us,” Long said of Russian involvement in hacking emails from the Democratic National Committee.So long as Assange does not “interfere in the affairs” of Ecuador, or the United Kingdom, and respects a “number of legal things,” his asylum status is secure, according to Long.Assange first sought refuge in Ecuador’s embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden, where authorities were investigating allegations of rape and sexual misconduct.Assange and others contended the Swedish investigation was a pretext for the U.S. to extradite him for publishing thousands of leaked secret American national security documents. He argued he was unlikely to get a fair trial in the U.S.The left-wing Ecuadorian government of President Rafael Correa granted Assange’s request for asylum, saying his fears were credible. Among its professed concerns was that Assange could face the death penalty in the U.S., where such punishment, unlike in many other countries, remains legal.“The whole issue surrounded his human rights,” Long said. “Ecuador acted within international law … on the basis of a strong suspicion that there could have been a case of political persecution, which is why you grant people asylum.”Ecuador facilitated an interrogation of Assange by Swedish authorities in November at the embassy, Long said."

In his remarks on Wednesday, Obama cautioned against “sudden unilateral moves” that could be “explosive”.Israel regards all of Jerusalem as its capital but most of the world does not, seeing its final status as a matter for peace negotiations that have been frozen since 2014.In a move that has emboldened Israeli right wingers, the president-elect has already appointed a new U.S. ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, who is considered far right on issues, including settlement building.Naftali Bennett, leader of the Jewish Home, hopes that under Trump’s administration the notion of establishing a Palestinian state will be abandoned.He wants to promote a bill extending Israeli sovereignty to Maale Adumim, a West Bank settlement of about 40,000 Israelis that lies just to the east of Jerusalem.That would in effect mean Israel annexing some of the land it has occupied for almost 50 years.“It’s either (Israeli) sovereignty or Palestine,” Bennett told Army Radio this month. “The question is not what will Trump do but what will Israel ask for. What will Israel present as its vision. We are in the money-time now for forming this vision.”But Professor Itamar Rabinovich, a former Israeli ambassador to the United States, believes the right wing may be getting ahead of itself and its ambitions could backfire.“In reality, where the United States needs to live not just with us but also with the Arab and Muslim world, supporting extremist measures in Israel could turn out to be something the United States cannot live with,” Rabinovich said.ANNEXATION “RED LINE”Bennett ultimately advocates the annexation of most of the West Bank, leaving just the major Palestinian towns and cities in Palestinian hands. But first he is testing the water with the annexation bill, entitled “Sovereignty in Maale Adumim First”. It is due for a first discussion in a ministerial committee on Sunday, two of its drafters said.“I believe this is the gift that the people of Israel deserve in the run-up to Trump’s inauguration,” Bennett’s fellow party member, Betzalel Smotrich, told parliament on Tuesday.A spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said annexation was a red line. “Any such Israeli decision will be considered a dangerous escalation that would end any possible hope for peace,” Nabil Abu Rdainah told Reuters.Late last year, a separate bill that would retroactively legalize settlement outposts built on privately-owned Palestinian land in the West Bank passed the first of three votes in parliament required to make it law. No dates have been set for final approval, and it has since disappeared from the agenda.Asked about the delay, a source in Netanyahu’s office said: “He wants to freeze the outpost bill.”Asked about the law, a legislative source said: “It’s stuck in committee. There will be attempts to bring it back on the agenda after Jan. 20, but I think it is pretty much buried at this point,” he said, referring to the date of the inauguration.The legislation had drawn anger from the Palestinians and international condemnation. Smotrich told Reuters that it will be brought to a second and third reading in February. “We were waiting for the end of the Obama age,” he said.A political source close to Netanyahu said that with regard to the proposed Maale Adumim annexation, the prime minister may say he wishes to hold off until after he meets Trump.Tzachi Hanegbi, a Likud minister and Netanyahu confidant, said Netanyahu understood that such steps would further isolate Israel. Most countries regard Israeli settlements as illegal, a view that Israel disputes.“He does not want to shake the entire world and put Israel at the center of contention, isolation and criticism,” Hanegbi told Army Radio. “I hope the government will not let itself be dragged after Jewish Home’s agenda.”At the same time, Netanyahu is competing with Jewish Home for right-wing, pro-settlement voters. He may disagree with the party’s approach, but he can’t ignore it.“If the (annexation) bill comes up, Likud ministers will support it. They can do nothing else,” the source said.(Writing by Maayan Lubell; Additional reporting by Ali Sawafta in Ramallah; Editing by Jeffrey Heller and Peter Millership)"

Reuters notes a test-launch could be “imminent” and could possibly take place around the time of Trump’s inauguration on Friday as a display of force directed at the incoming U.S. president.South Korean intelligence agencies reported that North Korea was transporting suspected ICBM parts, according to South Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo. The guided long-range missile is primarily designed to deliver nuclear weapons. “It was different from a conventional Musudan missile in its length and shape,” a source told the outlet, citing the weapon North Korea launched eight times last year (only once successfully).An official with South Korea’s Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff told reporters there were no “immediate signs of provocations” on behalf of the North, but the military was actively monitoring developments, Yonhap reported.“We remain vigilant as the North could fire a missile at any time and place determined by its leadership,” Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesman Roh Jae-cheon said during a news briefing.American officials told Reuters that the U.S. had spotted two mobile missile launchers, indicating a ballistic missile test may be forthcoming. However, the officials said the timing of the test and range of the missile remain unclear. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un made headlines during his New Year’s Day address when he said his nation was “actively progressing” on plans to test-launch an ICBM.“ICBM rocket test launch preparation is in its last stage,” Kim said, adding that North Korea “will continue to strengthen its ability based on nuclear might to mount a preemptive attack.”While North Korean leaders are known for their hyperbolic promises, the nation drew international ire last year after conducting several missile launches and its fourth and fifth nuclear tests. The actions prompted harsh sanctions from the United Nations Security Council, and North Korea’s future nuclear development will no doubt be an immediate concern for the incoming Trump administration.While Trump hasn’t announced any firm policies on how the United States will act to deter future launches, he responded to Kim’s address by tweeting, “It won’t happen!”"

Shutting it down was supposed to be easy. The Bush administration had already begun the process.But eight years of partisan battles, bureaucratic infighting and a last-ditch effort later, the facility that Obama once labeled a “blot on our national honor” remains open.No one is more acutely aware of that failure than the men Obama chose to lead his effort to shutter the camp. They can point to some successes in their mission. About 780 men and boys were incarcerated at Gitmo at one point or another. Exactly 242 remained when Obama took office and today just 41 men are imprisoned there. Yet it’s likely those men will stay at Gitmo for the rest of their lives.Looking back, the “Guantanamo czars” say the administration made key mistakes by badly misjudging the mood of Congress, agreeing to use military tribunals and not moving fast enough to close the prison from the very start.To members of the Obama administration, the Guantanamo prison camp, which President George W. Bush had opened in 2002 to house the so-called masterminds behind the 9/11 attacks, always felt like an inherited burden. “In the Bush administration, there were a lot of decisions made in haste and in the emotion of the moment that turned out not to be wise, and Guantanamo was one of them,” said Daniel Fried, a career diplomat who served as a special assistant to Bush and became Obama’s first special envoy for Guantanamo closure.By the end of the Bush administration, Fried said, hundreds of detainees had already being transferred elsewhere, and White House officials wanted to close the prison. Fried recalled a Bush official muttering that if all of the detainees were released, the damage they might do would be less than damage the existence of Guantanamo itself did to the U.S. effort to fight terrorists around the world.When Obama took office in 2009, his goal was to send as many of the 242 remaining prisoners back to their own countries as possible. For those who couldn’t go home due to prolonged instability or fear of religious persecution, he would find other nations willing to take them. Those not yet cleared for release would be held in federal prisons. A smaller group accused of crimes against the U.S. would be housed in federal prisons and tried in federal courts.Closing the camp had drawn support from prominent Republican voices on foreign policy, including Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who had just lost the presidential race to Obama.“It did not seem to be highly contentious and I think it would be fair to say that in the early days of the transition we thought this would take place in the ordinary course of business,” said Greg Craig, Obama’s first White House counsel, who drafted the executive order to close Guantanamo.Still, nobody in the administration was immediately assigned the job. It was a mistake. With no one officially focused on Gitmo closure, no one was watching for any red flags in Congress.One day, Craig received a warning. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) called and told him that Congress was tacking language onto a funding bill that would ban the administration from moving any Guantanamo detainees to the U.S.Craig felt unsure of what to do. The legislative fight wasn’t in his job description. “I said, ‘That’s something that the congressional liaison people are handling. I’ll make sure that they are on top of it,’” he recalled.Now he sees that moment as a turning point. “The fact that suddenly the Republicans were seeking to put conditions on the closure of Guantanamo, and the fact that in the administration we weren’t fighting back or weren’t reacting to defend our freedom to close it, was a warning shot, in retrospect,” Craig said.As that bill was being readied, the Obama White House was working on its first detainee transfers — the last 17 Uighurs left at Gitmo. The Uighurs were Chinese Muslims who had traveled to Afghanistan in the 1990s to flee persecution at home. They would face further persecution if sent back to China. But keeping them at Guantanamo was also wrong: They had been handed over to the U.S. after the Afghanistan invasion in exchange for bounty, and they had no connection to 9/11 or the Iraq War.“If we had problems with [releasing] the Uighurs,” Craig said, “we were going to have problems with everybody.”Obama administration officials decided to resettle the Uighurs in the United States. The first few would be released in Northern Virginia, where there was an existing Uighur community. But in early May 2009, after the media reported the administration’s plans, Rep. Frank Wolf (R-Va.) gave an impassioned speech on the House floor saying he didn’t want “terrorists” in his district. Congress soon passed a measure effectively preventing U.S. resettlement of the detainees — the same measure Feinstein had warned Craig about. Half a year after taking office, the Obama administration had lost the first Gitmo battle.The administration backed off. “I would say that the more intense the controversy grew, the less willing we were to engage in that fight,” Craig said.Craig’s own tenure as White House counsel lasted less than a year. He left the administration in January 2010. News accounts claimed he was pushed out in part because he couldn’t get the ball rolling fast enough on Guantanamo.“We were losing 700,000 jobs a month, we were trying to put together a bipartisan coalition to support a national health insurance program, and there were only so many fights that could be conducted at the same time,” said Craig, now of counsel at the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.But Obama still hoped to close Guantanamo, Craig said. “On the day I left, I think he still believed that he could close it.”As the Uighurs’ fate was being debated, the White House finally picked someone to focus full-time on shutting down the prison camp: Fried.The newly appointed Guantanamo czar had worked in the Foreign Service since the late 1970s, under Democratic and Republican presidents. He sees the political process as often unnecessarily partisan and warns people to “watch out for decisions taken in the heat of the moment,” paraphrasing one of his idols, Irish political philosopher Edmund Burke.When then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton asked Fried to take on the Guantanamo job, she “was wry about it,” he recalled. “She said, ‘Hey, you were in the Bush administration for eight years right? Then you can help clean up one of their messes.’”But Fried soon found himself constrained by Republican lawmakers determined to stop the administration from moving Guantanamo detainees anywhere for any purpose.“The vast majority of Congress was not willing to do anything, because if just one person went back to the battlefield, then they would be blamed,” explained former Rep. Jim Moran (D-Va.), who helped lead the fight in Congress to close the prison. “It was easier to let people be indefinitely confined in some cases and tortured so that no one in power would risk being accused of being soft on terrorists.”The administration had expected that transferring the detainees to third countries would be its most difficult task, Fried said. “We thought that the issues of trials would be far easier,” he said, “That turned out to be just wrong.”By the time Fried was considering which detainees to try in federal court, Republican lawmakers were moving full speed to stop that, too. The congressional measure that prevented the Uighurs from being resettled in the U.S. also restricted the use of federal funds to transfer prisoners from Gitmo to U.S. soil for the purposes of prosecution.To Fried, it was clearly politics at play. He had seen how earnestly Bush staffers sought to close the prison with no pushback from the Republicans — and no support from Democrats. Now he was witnessing a 180-degree reversal.“It was very clear to me that the path [to closure] was getting narrower and narrower,” said Fried. “I think the Republicans and the Democrats both were inconsistent. Why didn’t the Democrats help both [administrations]? They didn’t want to help Bush at all. Why didn’t the Republicans take seriously the national security problems that Gitmo posed? Well, because they wanted to go after Obama.”Blocked from using federal courts to try Gitmo detainees, Fried and the White House were left with one option for legal proceedings: military tribunals.Guantanamo’s military tribunal system had been established under a Bush executive order, struck down by the Supreme Court in 2006 and quickly re-established by Congress the same year. Several detainees had been charged during Bush’s tenure, but less than a handful had been judged and sentenced. The system had a history of delays.Obama decided to meet Republicans in the middle. By reforming and using the tribunals, Craig said, the president aimed to show that he could pursue bipartisan solutions on national security issues. Today, that effort to play ball with Republicans at a time when many of them were actively attempting to tighten the reins on the executive branch seems idealistic at best. To several of the former Gitmo czars, Obama’s decision to go ahead with the military tribunals was the kiss of death for Guantanamo closure.“As long as the military tribunal process was going, it would be very hard to close Guantanamo because that was the location of the military tribunal,” Craig said.Fried had harsher words. “This mythology arose that federal courts are weak because they give rights to terrorists,” he said. “It’s a very snappy bumper sticker. So the Obama administration turned to military tribunals. It turned out to be just wrong, demonstrably false. Federal courts are not weak, they are strong, they get convictions. ... But we caved to the pressure. I’m sorry we did it. We should have pushed harder.”Only 30 detainees would be formally charged under the military tribunals during the Obama presidency, and a mere eight would make it through trial to conviction. Part of the problem was that the tribunals were “untested institutions,” Fried said, without the well-established rules and procedures of the federal court system.“Because they lacked a kind of public legitimacy,” Fried said, “the military bent over backwards to try to be fair, which meant more opportunities for delay.”Craig called the system a complete “failure.”“The president of the United States promised swift and certain justice when he became president in January 2009,” he said, “and we’ve had anything but.”Seeing his fellow lawmakers’ disdain for the prisoners, Moran, the Virginia congressman pushing to close the prison, began to lose hope that the Guantanamo situation could be fixed at all.“I thought it was a state of deliberate people not wanting to know the facts,” he said. “For 200 years, our judicial system has stood the test of time, and here we violated it. … Here you create this suspension of justice, and you let them wallow in despair and in complete violation of the historical norms.”Fried labored for over three years as the Gitmo czar, transferring 70 detainees in total. (The administration also moved out a handful before he came on board.) His efforts kept hitting roadblocks, including when Democrats lost control of the House of Representatives in 2010. But it was the passage of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2011, which required that any country willing to accept a Guantanamo detainee must first guarantee that the released man would never again engage in terrorism activity, that ultimately “exhausted all of the political capital,” Fried said.In January 2013, at the beginning of Obama’s second term, Fried was reassigned. For several months, the president chose not to appoint a new special envoy for Guantanamo closure.But Obama hadn’t given up yet. In May of that year, speaking at the National Defense University, he recommitted his administration to closing Guantanamo, then under renewed public scrutiny because multiple detainees had gone on hunger strikes.The timing was important on another level as well: The president was thinking about his legacy.“I sort of suspected that the White House might give it another try,” Fried said. “There is nothing like legacy time to get people to focus.”In July 2013, Obama appointed lawyer Clifford Sloan as the new special envoy on the advice of Secretary of State John Kerry, who knew him personally. Sloan was a partner at the Skadden law firm (Craig knew and approved of him, too) who had once served in President Bill Clinton’s White House.At the time Sloan took the helm, there were 166 prisoners left at Guantanamo and more than half of them had been approved for transfer.“They were just languishing there, and I thought it was unconscionable,” Sloan said. Still, he knew that closing the prison would be an uphill battle. “I had people tell me, ‘You’re not going to be able to move a single person.’”But Sloan hoped that the passage of time might have eased some fears in Congress. He even came close to persuading the Senate to pass a bill allowing the administration to transfer some detainees to the U.S. That language was ultimately stripped from the legislation.“It was frustrating that you couldn’t get this limited authority and move them to the U.S.,” Sloan said. “It’s totally at odds with anything we’ve ever done with the law of war detention.”Sloan did manage to get language passed that made it easier to send detainees to third countries that were willing to monitor them. He also set up a periodic review board to speed up the process of determining which prisoners could be released. And during his 16 months on the job, he transferred 39 prisoners to other countries and set the path for release of 11 more.Sloan also faced some unexpected hurdles within the Obama administration. “There was a period where there were a number of transfers that were completely ready to go and there was a period of unnecessary delay,” he said.According to media reports at the time, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel was dragging his feet on releasing the detainees because he was concerned they would kill Americans once released. Although Hagel announced his resignation in November 2014, Sloan, frustrated by continued delays, departed a month later.Lee Wolosky led the Obama administration’s final push to empty the Gitmo detention facility. Another lawyer, he had worked at the National Security Council under Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.Since July 2015, Wolosky has moved 75 detainees from Guantanamo, getting the count down to 41. A final four were just transferred on the eve of Donald Trump’s inauguration, Foreign Policy reported Thursday.Obama pushed to close the prison up until the bitter end. On Thursday, in his final hours as president, he sent one last letter to Congress urging lawmakers to “close a facility that never should have been opened in the first place” and warning them that “history will cast a harsh judgment on this aspect of our fight against terrorism and those of us who fail to bring it to a responsible end.”The remaining prisoners will become President Trump’s problem, as will the decision whether to continue the effort to empty Guantanamo. So far, Trump has indicated he wants to keep the camp open and even increase the number of prisoners — to “load it up with some bad dudes,” he said, potentially by bringing in people with ties to the Islamic State. He has also said he would be “fine” with sending Americans accused of terrorism to Guantanamo.The men Obama asked to shutter Guantanamo have mixed feelings about their legacies.“Now what people will say is, ‘Aw, they failed.’ But you know, as failures go, that’s pretty damn good,” said Fried. “Lee Wolosky, I think in the end he moved more than I did. The administration deserves credit.” Even if Obama’s team didn’t ultimately close Guantanamo, Fried said, “that last year-and-a-half effort is impressive.”Sloan is also pleased with the final number, or at least the work that went into releasing so many detainees. “It’s great progress,” he said, “and great progress is a very good thing.”But Moran, the congressman who wanted to close the camp, refuses to express any glass-half-full optimism.“It will be recorded in history as a stain on our nation’s soul, much in the way that other things we have done define us in ways we don’t want to accept, like slavery and the genocide of Native Americans,” he said. “I think they are just going to rot there for the rest of their lives.”Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

The Bush administration had already begun the process.But eight years of partisan battles, bureaucratic infighting and a last-ditch effort later, the facility that Obama once labeled a “blot on our national honor” remains open.No one is more acutely aware of that failure than the men Obama chose to lead his effort to shutter the camp. They can point to some successes in their mission. About 780 men and boys were incarcerated at Gitmo at one point or another. Exactly 242 remained when Obama took office and today just 41 men are imprisoned there. Yet it’s likely those men will stay at Gitmo for the rest of their lives.Looking back, the “Guantanamo czars” say the administration made key mistakes by badly misjudging the mood of Congress, agreeing to use military tribunals and not moving fast enough to close the prison from the very start.To members of the Obama administration, the Guantanamo prison camp, which President George W. Bush had opened in 2002 to house the so-called masterminds behind the 9/11 attacks, always felt like an inherited burden. “In the Bush administration, there were a lot of decisions made in haste and in the emotion of the moment that turned out not to be wise, and Guantanamo was one of them,” said Daniel Fried, a career diplomat who served as a special assistant to Bush and became Obama’s first special envoy for Guantanamo closure.By the end of the Bush administration, Fried said, hundreds of detainees had already being transferred elsewhere, and White House officials wanted to close the prison. Fried recalled a Bush official muttering that if all of the detainees were released, the damage they might do would be less than damage the existence of Guantanamo itself did to the U.S. effort to fight terrorists around the world.When Obama took office in 2009, his goal was to send as many of the 242 remaining prisoners back to their own countries as possible. For those who couldn’t go home due to prolonged instability or fear of religious persecution, he would find other nations willing to take them. Those not yet cleared for release would be held in federal prisons. A smaller group accused of crimes against the U.S. would be housed in federal prisons and tried in federal courts.Closing the camp had drawn support from prominent Republican voices on foreign policy, including Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who had just lost the presidential race to Obama.“It did not seem to be highly contentious and I think it would be fair to say that in the early days of the transition we thought this would take place in the ordinary course of business,” said Greg Craig, Obama’s first White House counsel, who drafted the executive order to close Guantanamo.Still, nobody in the administration was immediately assigned the job. It was a mistake. With no one officially focused on Gitmo closure, no one was watching for any red flags in Congress.One day, Craig received a warning. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) called and told him that Congress was tacking language onto a funding bill that would ban the administration from moving any Guantanamo detainees to the U.S.Craig felt unsure of what to do. The legislative fight wasn’t in his job description. “I said, ‘That’s something that the congressional liaison people are handling. I’ll make sure that they are on top of it,’” he recalled.Now he sees that moment as a turning point. “The fact that suddenly the Republicans were seeking to put conditions on the closure of Guantanamo, and the fact that in the administration we weren’t fighting back or weren’t reacting to defend our freedom to close it, was a warning shot, in retrospect,” Craig said.As that bill was being readied, the Obama White House was working on its first detainee transfers — the last 17 Uighurs left at Gitmo. The Uighurs were Chinese Muslims who had traveled to Afghanistan in the 1990s to flee persecution at home. They would face further persecution if sent back to China. But keeping them at Guantanamo was also wrong: They had been handed over to the U.S. after the Afghanistan invasion in exchange for bounty, and they had no connection to 9/11 or the Iraq War.“If we had problems with [releasing] the Uighurs,” Craig said, “we were going to have problems with everybody.”Obama administration officials decided to resettle the Uighurs in the United States. The first few would be released in Northern Virginia, where there was an existing Uighur community. But in early May 2009, after the media reported the administration’s plans, Rep. Frank Wolf (R-Va.) gave an impassioned speech on the House floor saying he didn’t want “terrorists” in his district. Congress soon passed a measure effectively preventing U.S. resettlement of the detainees — the same measure Feinstein had warned Craig about. Half a year after taking office, the Obama administration had lost the first Gitmo battle.The administration backed off. “I would say that the more intense the controversy grew, the less willing we were to engage in that fight,” Craig said.Craig’s own tenure as White House counsel lasted less than a year. He left the administration in January 2010. News accounts claimed he was pushed out in part because he couldn’t get the ball rolling fast enough on Guantanamo.“We were losing 700,000 jobs a month, we were trying to put together a bipartisan coalition to support a national health insurance program, and there were only so many fights that could be conducted at the same time,” said Craig, now of counsel at the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.But Obama still hoped to close Guantanamo, Craig said. “On the day I left, I think he still believed that he could close it.”As the Uighurs’ fate was being debated, the White House finally picked someone to focus full-time on shutting down the prison camp: Fried.The newly appointed Guantanamo czar had worked in the Foreign Service since the late 1970s, under Democratic and Republican presidents. He sees the political process as often unnecessarily partisan and warns people to “watch out for decisions taken in the heat of the moment,” paraphrasing one of his idols, Irish political philosopher Edmund Burke.When then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton asked Fried to take on the Guantanamo job, she “was wry about it,” he recalled. “She said, ‘Hey, you were in the Bush administration for eight years right? Then you can help clean up one of their messes.’”But Fried soon found himself constrained by Republican lawmakers determined to stop the administration from moving Guantanamo detainees anywhere for any purpose.“The vast majority of Congress was not willing to do anything, because if just one person went back to the battlefield, then they would be blamed,” explained former Rep. Jim Moran (D-Va.), who helped lead the fight in Congress to close the prison. “It was easier to let people be indefinitely confined in some cases and tortured so that no one in power would risk being accused of being soft on terrorists.”The administration had expected that transferring the detainees to third countries would be its most difficult task, Fried said. “We thought that the issues of trials would be far easier,” he said, “That turned out to be just wrong.”By the time Fried was considering which detainees to try in federal court, Republican lawmakers were moving full speed to stop that, too. The congressional measure that prevented the Uighurs from being resettled in the U.S. also restricted the use of federal funds to transfer prisoners from Gitmo to U.S. soil for the purposes of prosecution.To Fried, it was clearly politics at play. He had seen how earnestly Bush staffers sought to close the prison with no pushback from the Republicans — and no support from Democrats. Now he was witnessing a 180-degree reversal.“It was very clear to me that the path [to closure] was getting narrower and narrower,” said Fried. “I think the Republicans and the Democrats both were inconsistent. Why didn’t the Democrats help both [administrations]? They didn’t want to help Bush at all. Why didn’t the Republicans take seriously the national security problems that Gitmo posed? Well, because they wanted to go after Obama.”Blocked from using federal courts to try Gitmo detainees, Fried and the White House were left with one option for legal proceedings: military tribunals.Guantanamo’s military tribunal system had been established under a Bush executive order, struck down by the Supreme Court in 2006 and quickly re-established by Congress the same year. Several detainees had been charged during Bush’s tenure, but less than a handful had been judged and sentenced. The system had a history of delays.Obama decided to meet Republicans in the middle. By reforming and using the tribunals, Craig said, the president aimed to show that he could pursue bipartisan solutions on national security issues. Today, that effort to play ball with Republicans at a time when many of them were actively attempting to tighten the reins on the executive branch seems idealistic at best. To several of the former Gitmo czars, Obama’s decision to go ahead with the military tribunals was the kiss of death for Guantanamo closure.“As long as the military tribunal process was going, it would be very hard to close Guantanamo because that was the location of the military tribunal,” Craig said.Fried had harsher words. “This mythology arose that federal courts are weak because they give rights to terrorists,” he said. “It’s a very snappy bumper sticker. So the Obama administration turned to military tribunals. It turned out to be just wrong, demonstrably false. Federal courts are not weak, they are strong, they get convictions. ... But we caved to the pressure. I’m sorry we did it. We should have pushed harder.”Only 30 detainees would be formally charged under the military tribunals during the Obama presidency, and a mere eight would make it through trial to conviction. Part of the problem was that the tribunals were “untested institutions,” Fried said, without the well-established rules and procedures of the federal court system.“Because they lacked a kind of public legitimacy,” Fried said, “the military bent over backwards to try to be fair, which meant more opportunities for delay.”Craig called the system a complete “failure.”“The president of the United States promised swift and certain justice when he became president in January 2009,” he said, “and we’ve had anything but.”Seeing his fellow lawmakers’ disdain for the prisoners, Moran, the Virginia congressman pushing to close the prison, began to lose hope that the Guantanamo situation could be fixed at all.“I thought it was a state of deliberate people not wanting to know the facts,” he said. “For 200 years, our judicial system has stood the test of time, and here we violated it. … Here you create this suspension of justice, and you let them wallow in despair and in complete violation of the historical norms.”Fried labored for over three years as the Gitmo czar, transferring 70 detainees in total. (The administration also moved out a handful before he came on board.) His efforts kept hitting roadblocks, including when Democrats lost control of the House of Representatives in 2010. But it was the passage of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2011, which required that any country willing to accept a Guantanamo detainee must first guarantee that the released man would never again engage in terrorism activity, that ultimately “exhausted all of the political capital,” Fried said.In January 2013, at the beginning of Obama’s second term, Fried was reassigned. For several months, the president chose not to appoint a new special envoy for Guantanamo closure.But Obama hadn’t given up yet. In May of that year, speaking at the National Defense University, he recommitted his administration to closing Guantanamo, then under renewed public scrutiny because multiple detainees had gone on hunger strikes.The timing was important on another level as well: The president was thinking about his legacy.“I sort of suspected that the White House might give it another try,” Fried said. “There is nothing like legacy time to get people to focus.”In July 2013, Obama appointed lawyer Clifford Sloan as the new special envoy on the advice of Secretary of State John Kerry, who knew him personally. Sloan was a partner at the Skadden law firm (Craig knew and approved of him, too) who had once served in President Bill Clinton’s White House.At the time Sloan took the helm, there were 166 prisoners left at Guantanamo and more than half of them had been approved for transfer.“They were just languishing there, and I thought it was unconscionable,” Sloan said. Still, he knew that closing the prison would be an uphill battle. “I had people tell me, ‘You’re not going to be able to move a single person.’”But Sloan hoped that the passage of time might have eased some fears in Congress. He even came close to persuading the Senate to pass a bill allowing the administration to transfer some detainees to the U.S. That language was ultimately stripped from the legislation.“It was frustrating that you couldn’t get this limited authority and move them to the U.S.,” Sloan said. “It’s totally at odds with anything we’ve ever done with the law of war detention.”Sloan did manage to get language passed that made it easier to send detainees to third countries that were willing to monitor them. He also set up a periodic review board to speed up the process of determining which prisoners could be released. And during his 16 months on the job, he transferred 39 prisoners to other countries and set the path for release of 11 more.Sloan also faced some unexpected hurdles within the Obama administration. “There was a period where there were a number of transfers that were completely ready to go and there was a period of unnecessary delay,” he said.According to media reports at the time, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel was dragging his feet on releasing the detainees because he was concerned they would kill Americans once released. Although Hagel announced his resignation in November 2014, Sloan, frustrated by continued delays, departed a month later.Lee Wolosky led the Obama administration’s final push to empty the Gitmo detention facility. Another lawyer, he had worked at the National Security Council under Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.Since July 2015, Wolosky has moved 75 detainees from Guantanamo, getting the count down to 41. A final four were just transferred on the eve of Donald Trump’s inauguration, Foreign Policy reported Thursday.Obama pushed to close the prison up until the bitter end. On Thursday, in his final hours as president, he sent one last letter to Congress urging lawmakers to “close a facility that never should have been opened in the first place” and warning them that “history will cast a harsh judgment on this aspect of our fight against terrorism and those of us who fail to bring it to a responsible end.”The remaining prisoners will become President Trump’s problem, as will the decision whether to continue the effort to empty Guantanamo. So far, Trump has indicated he wants to keep the camp open and even increase the number of prisoners — to “load it up with some bad dudes,” he said, potentially by bringing in people with ties to the Islamic State. He has also said he would be “fine” with sending Americans accused of terrorism to Guantanamo.The men Obama asked to shutter Guantanamo have mixed feelings about their legacies.“Now what people will say is, ‘Aw, they failed.’ But you know, as failures go, that’s pretty damn good,” said Fried. “Lee Wolosky, I think in the end he moved more than I did. The administration deserves credit.” Even if Obama’s team didn’t ultimately close Guantanamo, Fried said, “that last year-and-a-half effort is impressive.”Sloan is also pleased with the final number, or at least the work that went into releasing so many detainees. “It’s great progress,” he said, “and great progress is a very good thing.”But Moran, the congressman who wanted to close the camp, refuses to express any glass-half-full optimism.“It will be recorded in history as a stain on our nation’s soul, much in the way that other things we have done define us in ways we don’t want to accept, like slavery and the genocide of Native Americans,” he said. “I think they are just going to rot there for the rest of their lives.”Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

At least seven independent groups of Christians and other concerned citizens throughout California will be joining Muslims in prayer as President-elect Donald Trump is sworn into office, the organization said in a press release.“As people of faith, we consider religious freedom for all people to be a priority,” Rev. Paige Eaves, president of PCU, told The Huffington Post. “We are concerned that if one form of religion can be targeted for registration, surveillance, and other violations of civil rights, then the same persecution could happen to any form of religion.”Rev. Timothy Murphy, a Los Angeles-based pastor and PCU member said simply: “We’re here to remind our Muslim brothers and sisters that they belong here, and we love them.”Inauguration Day happens to fall on a Friday ― the day of the week when many observant Muslims visit their local mosque for jummah prayers. That also means that as Muslims gather in a sacred act of spiritual communion, the country will inaugurate a president who has floated the idea of banning Muslims from immigrating to the U.S. and has been open to the idea of registering American Muslims on a national database. He’s also surrounded himself with advisors and allies who harbor prejudice against of Islam. One of them, Rev. Franklin Graham, will be offering prayers at the inauguration.But on Friday, groups of Christians and other concerned citizens will gather at mosques from Santa Cruz to Irvine, spanning the southern half of the California coast. One of the largest events will take place at the Islamic Center of Southern California, which just months ago received calls from a man threatening to kill worshippers because of his “hatred for Muslims.” The man was arrested in October, and police found an assortment of rifles, shotguns, and handguns in his home, as well as thousands of rounds of ammunition.Omar Ricci, a spokesperson for the center, said many in the congregation are feeling a sense of “apprehension” as Trump, who many believed fanned the flames of Islamophobia, takes the country’s helm.“People are worried how far will the rhetoric get translated into actions or policies based on politically-motivated ignorance,” Ricci told HuffPost.Like the Islamic Center of Southern California, many mosques around the country have felt the effects of rising Islamophobia in the wake of the election. A number of mosques throughout California and around the U.S. received threatening letters several weeks after the day of the election. Mosques have also been vandalized, littered with Islamophobic pamphlets and even burned down in recent months. Murphy, who will be among those visiting the Islamic Center of Southern California, said standing up for marginalized communities is a core tenet of Christianity.“In my tradition Jesus stood on the side of those who were mistreated and marginalized in his day. So if we want to be disciples we should look to stand alongside those who are being mistreated or denigrated in our day,” Murphy told HuffPost.Gina Whitaker, an interfaith activist and Unitarian Universalist based in San Luis Obispo, is leading a group of roughly a dozen to the central coast city’s local mosque. For Whitaker, the event represents not only an opportunity to stand with Muslims, but also to reflect on her own faith in a meditative way.“I wanted to divorce myself from the goings on in Washington and engage myself in a prayerful hour,” Whitaker said.Ahmed Deif, president of San Luis Obispo’s Islamic Society of the Central Coast, said the mosque has had many neighbors like Whitaker reaching out in recent months to come stand in solidarity. “With the negative messages that came out [about Muslims] from President Trump’s campaign we had a lot of groups reaching out to us in San Luis Obispo and saying ‘This kind of speech doesn’t represent us and what this country is about,’” Deif told HuffPost.In other places the election simply gave rise to curiosity and questions about a faith that most Americans know very little about. “There’s been an upswing in requests for tours and visits since the election,” Nicole Bovey Alhakawati, chair of public relations at the Islamic Institute of Orange County, told HuffPost.Friday’s solidarity events mark an important continuation in this trend, she added. “I think the benefit of this whole campaign of hate is that more people want to know about Muslims and understand Muslims in their community.” For many Muslim Americans, actions of solidarity in the midst of such bigotry don’t go unnoticed. “To have support at this critical time is very symbolic, very meaningful and very emotional,” said Jihad Turk, president of Bayan Claremont, an Islamic seminary in Southern California, and a former imam at the Islamic Center of Southern California.Many of the groups participating in Friday’s event have a longstanding commitment to interfaith work, and Eaves emphasized that PCU’s focus on Muslim solidarity will extend beyond Inauguration Day.“This event will need to be one of many in a sustained effort to create the kinds of conversations and relationships that will counter the barrage of well-financed anti-Muslim rhetoric,” Eaves told HuffPost.Friday, she said, is a first step. “Once you pray together or share a meal together, your world is already a little bit different than it was before. You have to start somewhere.”"

For Whitaker, the event represents not only an opportunity to stand with Muslims, but also to reflect on her own faith in a meditative way.“I wanted to divorce myself from the goings on in Washington and engage myself in a prayerful hour,” Whitaker said.Ahmed Deif, president of San Luis Obispo’s Islamic Society of the Central Coast, said the mosque has had many neighbors like Whitaker reaching out in recent months to come stand in solidarity. “With the negative messages that came out [about Muslims] from President Trump’s campaign we had a lot of groups reaching out to us in San Luis Obispo and saying ‘This kind of speech doesn’t represent us and what this country is about,’” Deif told HuffPost.In other places the election simply gave rise to curiosity and questions about a faith that most Americans know very little about. “There’s been an upswing in requests for tours and visits since the election,” Nicole Bovey Alhakawati, chair of public relations at the Islamic Institute of Orange County, told HuffPost.Friday’s solidarity events mark an important continuation in this trend, she added. “I think the benefit of this whole campaign of hate is that more people want to know about Muslims and understand Muslims in their community.” For many Muslim Americans, actions of solidarity in the midst of such bigotry don’t go unnoticed. “To have support at this critical time is very symbolic, very meaningful and very emotional,” said Jihad Turk, president of Bayan Claremont, an Islamic seminary in Southern California, and a former imam at the Islamic Center of Southern California.Many of the groups participating in Friday’s event have a longstanding commitment to interfaith work, and Eaves emphasized that PCU’s focus on Muslim solidarity will extend beyond Inauguration Day.“This event will need to be one of many in a sustained effort to create the kinds of conversations and relationships that will counter the barrage of well-financed anti-Muslim rhetoric,” Eaves told HuffPost.Friday, she said, is a first step. “Once you pray together or share a meal together, your world is already a little bit different than it was before. You have to start somewhere.”"
49,POLITICS,"Who's To Say The Word 'Slants' Offends Asians? The Supreme Court, That's Who.",Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-patent-trademark-the-slants_us_58801bd2e4b02c1837e9a8a3,How an Asian-American band's trademark battle aims to reclaim derogatory names -- and the First Amendment.,2017-01-19,"Even if The Slants lose the Supreme Court case, the band may have already won.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5880267e170000fa01fdf71d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The Supreme Court tends to take a skeptical view whenever the government polices speech it doesn’t like. But what if the government simply denies a trademark that it deems offensive to a racial or ethnic group?The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office did exactly that when it rejected a trademark application from The Slants, an Asian-American band that aims to promote its name and music to tear down racial stereotypes — and maybe even stick it to a certain Washington football team the band’s leader is not very fond of.But to offend fellow Asian-Americans? Perish the thought.The justices on Wednesday wrestled with whether a provision of trademark law that tells the federal trademark office to not give its seal of approval to names that “may disparage” others is consistent with the First Amendment. An appeals court that specializes in trademark disputes concluded that it doesn’t, and it struck down the provision as unconstitutional “viewpoint discrimination.”The issue is a fascinating one, in part because of the scores of advocates on both sides of this controversy who are throwing their hats in the ring. Native American groups, for one, support the government, which in 2014 also canceled a little football trademark that now finds its owner, Daniel Snyder, rooting for The Slants. The band’s case may save or doom the team’s chances at keeping “Redskins.”The Obama administration, on its last day of legal arguments before the next regime takes over, said nothing in the trademark provision prevents The Slants from using the name, let alone impede its music or message. Instead, the government’s lawyer said, the anti-disparagement provision “places a reasonable limit on access to a government program” that “does not violate the First Amendment.”But some of the justices didn’t seem so convinced, or at least seemed to be playing devil’s advocate. Chief Justice John Roberts called the government’s argument “circular,” and Justice Stephen Breyer had questions about the “purpose” of a law that tells the powers that be what’s good and what isn’t.“I can think probably of ... perhaps 50,000 examples of instances where the space the trademark provides is used for very distracting messages,” Breyer said, later adding, “What business does Congress have picking out this one but letting all the other distractions exist?”Justice Elena Kagan, one of the more active questioners on the bench, took issue with what appears to be the government’s censorious view on trademarks it deems negative but not with those it deems positive.The law “precludes disparagement of Democrats and Republicans alike, and so forth and so on,” Kagan said, “but it makes a very important distinction, which is that you can say good things about some person or group but you can’t say bad things about some person or group.”“The point is that I can say good things about something, but I can’t say bad things about something,” she added. “And I would have thought that that was a fairly classic case of viewpoint discrimination.”If the Supreme Court were to find that the trademark office is engaging in such discrimination — and a bevy of free-speech, business and even religious advocates submitted briefs to the court arguing that it is — then the law violates the First Amendment.But does it? Justice Sonia Sotomayor suggested that The Slants’ music and message “are not being burdened in any traditional way” because they can still do everything a band does — even sue another band for appropriating its name — except without a trademark.“No one is stopping your client from calling itself The Slants,” she told the Portland, Oregon, band’s lawyer, John Connell. “No one is stopping them from advertising themselves that way, or signing contracts that way or engaging in any activity, except that stopping someone else from using the same trademark.”Asked by Breyer whether the government could deny a trademark calling someone a name or a food product lethal, Connell took a hard-line approach and said no. But that exposed a limit to The Slants’ argument.“Oh, my goodness,” Breyer exclaimed. “There are laws all over the place that stop you from saying that a competitor … has bad products. It’s called product disparagement. There are laws all over the place that stop you from saying Joe Jones is a jerk or something more specific. They’re called libel laws or slander laws. But you’re saying the government couldn’t do that?”If the Supreme Court decides that a trademark shouldn’t be treated like “speech in a public park,” as Justice Anthony Kennedy suggested, and instead is just a government program that may freely avoid certain racial and ethnic slurs, then The Slants would lose.But in other ways, The Slants will have already won.With or without the trademark, it would not be a stretch to say that the indie band has garnered more press for what it stands for than many others in its field. And it even has a song to show for it."

After a devastating presidential defeat and nearly a decade of steady losses in Congress and at the state level, there aren’t many other political battles for party activists to focus on. But the candidates themselves are not catering to grass-roots organizers or rank-and-file voters. They’re seeking the support of a majority of DNC members ― mostly state party leaders and political appointees ― and doing their damnedest to avoid ruffling any feathers. If any of the candidates on stage Wednesday were auditioning to serve as the opposition leader against President-elect Donald Trump, s/he managed to fool everyone. None were willing to call for an end to state caucuses ― complex presidential nominating processes that undermine a one-person-one-vote framework. When asked what the party should do about superdelegates ― party insiders the DNC has long granted special influence over its presidential nomination ― no candidate would support simply scuttling the undemocratic system. Former Fox News commentator Jehmu Greene spoke for the slate by arguing Democrats “need to be the party of innovation” on the superdelegate question. Coincidentally, members of the Democratic National Committee who get to vote for the DNC chair also serve as superdelegates in the presidential nominating process.Candidates couldn’t even acknowledge the DNC had botched the 2016 process. When asked whether the DNC “put its thumb on the scale” in favor of Hillary Clinton, no candidate would agree. “That’s a gotcha question,” Idaho Democratic Party Executive Director Sally Boynton Brown said. “I’m not going to answer.”The contentious 2016 primary between Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) exposed major fissures in the party. But the candidates studiously avoided emphasizing those divisions. Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Indiana, called the idea of the DNC race as a proxy battle between the Sanders and Clinton wings of the party a “false choice.”The candidates almost universally agreed that lobbyists should be allowed to keep giving money to the DNC. President Barack Obama banned lobbyist contributions to the party in 2008, a ban then-DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz quietly lifted in the 2016 election. Even Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), the most outspoken progressive in this DNC race, downplayed his prior commitment to reinstate the ban.“If I do become DNC chair, I am not going to impose a policy on anybody. We’re going to have a democratic process on how we arrive at funding the Democratic Party,” he said. Ellison, who co-chairs the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said he would make sure the ban came up for debate but said he would leave the ultimate decision up to the broader DNC body ― a deference that neither Obama nor Wasserman Schultz showed.“I think it’s incredibly important that we have the conversation,” he concluded. “We’ve got to at least talk about it because people do have this sense that in D.C. it’s just the puppet masters making all the calls.”Other candidates gave a full-throated defense of money in politics. South Carolina Democratic Party Chair Jaime Harrison, who has made his living as a lobbyist since 2008, claimed that denying the DNC lobbyist money would deprive the party of an irrecoverable $18 million. The DNC took in $18.9 million from lobbyists and lawyers combined in 2016, about 7 percent of the DNC’s total funding. Harrison denied that special interests were trying to influence Democratic policy with donations to the DNC.“When lobbyists and corporations give us money, what are they going to get from the DNC? It’s not like we have a vote in Congress; we can’t determine any laws,” he said. “So it must mean they are committed to the vision of helping us recruit candidates, build a new bench and all the like.”There were some fireworks. When asked whether billionaire Democratic donor Haim Saban should apologize for smearing Ellison as an anti-Semite, everyone on stage but Ellison and Greene agreed ― a rare rebuke from political aspirants directed toward a deep-pocketed supporter.“An attack against one of us really is an attack against all of us,” New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Ray Buckley said.“Keith is a great guy,” Harrison said. “I don’t believe that there’s an anti-Semitic bone in his body.”Greene was more cautious: “We need to stop falling for these gotcha questions,” she said, claiming “the media” was trying to “divide our funders from our leaders.”All seven candidates also agreed the DNC needs to be involved in “street-fighting,” “protests” and “direct action.”Labor Secretary Tom Perez, alone among the contenders, appeared to call for across-the-board obstruction to Trump’s agenda, registering the most rhetorically potent moment of the evening. “We can hit [Trump] between the eyes with a two-by-four and treat him like Mitch McConnell treated Barack Obama.”There were also legitimate disagreements over prescription drug policy. Last week, 13 Democrats joined 39 Republicans to vote down a symbolic amendment that would have allowed the importation of lower-priced prescription drugs from Canada.Answering a question about the amendment, Ellison turned the vote into a lesson about the power of activism. It was his best moment of the night. “I’m going to tell you something about politicians: They see the light when they feel the heat. If you guys get involved and tell them that you’re not alright with that, I think some votes will start going the way you want them to go,” he said, drawing applause. Harrison disagreed. “I saw that Democrats were yelling at Democrats, and it sent chills down my spine. What I would have done is huddled all the Democrats up together and said … let’s come up with an amendment that all Democrats can support so that we don’t go beating each other up.”It would make the next DNC chair’s job easy if Democrats could agree about everything all the time. But there are genuine disputes within the party over how to move forward in a moment of historic political impotence. On Wednesday night, nobody was willing to light the way.

Listen to Obama’s comments here.As a result, in addition to making the traditional arguments for raising the minimum wage and helping workers unionize, Democrats “are going to have to start thinking about where do jobs come from and how much government involvement is there in the marketplace.”Obama suggested that as technology eliminates more jobs, Democrats might consider more ambitious government intervention to ensure people remain employed.“Do we have a job-sharing economy that works so that everybody has work, because it turns out work is not just about finances, but it is about dignity and feeling like you got a place in the world. And how do you pay for that?” he said. “And more and more people are working in the service sector. How do we make sure that they are getting paid enough?”“We have to be a little more creative about anticipating what’s coming down the pike, because automation is relentless and it’s going to accelerate,” he concluded.Obama made the remarks while discussing what Democrats should say when they set out to re-engage the voters in smaller towns who voted for Obama in the past and then opted for Donald Trump in November.“The first thing they should say is, what is it that you guys want? I think you start by listening and trying to tease out from people what is it they’re most worried about,” Obama said.“I have my suspicions about what they’ll say, which is, they feel as if there are cities and power centers around this country that are doing really well and they feel like nobody’s paying attention to them and that things are deteriorating,” he posited. “And that the way of life and security that they used to feel they had isn’t there anymore.”Check out our Obama legacy series, including a look at his record on jobs."

But that’s not the weird part.“It is reported that the Skittles were intended to be feed for cattle as they did not make the cut for packaging at the company,” the sheriff’s office shared, to mixed reactions from readers.“Somebody must have left the unicorn’s stall open!” one Facebook user wrote.“Seriously? They feed that junk to our cattle?” wrote another.Strangely, feeding candy to cattle is not a new idea.During a 2012 drought in the Midwest, one rancher shared how he mixed unwanted candy with an ethanol by-product and a mineral nutrient before serving it to his animals.The candy is said to substitute the starchy sugar content that the animals would otherwise get from corn.“I think it’s a viable (diet),” John Waller, an animal science professor at the University of Tennessee, told Live Science back in 2012. “It keeps fat material from going out in the landfill, and it’s a good way to get nutrients in these cattle. The alternative would be to put (the candy) in a landfill somewhere.”The College of Agricultural and Life Sciences at the University of Wisconsin at Madison also acknowledged the practice in a 2008 report on by-product feed. The report states that the candy ― notably chocolate ― provides “economical sources of nutrients, particularly fat.” Ki Fanning, a livestock nutritionist with Great Plains Livestock Consulting, Inc. in Eagle, Neb., also defended the sugary feed.“It has been a practice going on for decades and is a very good way to for producers to reduce feed cost, and to provide less expensive food for consumers,” he told CNN Money.As for how the cattle feel about this, this Oregon goat may not be a b-ah-ah-d guy to question.A request for comment from a spokeswoman for Wrigley’s, which produces Skittles, was not immediately returned Thursday."

Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-rick-perry_us_5880fe24e4b070d8cad116ff,"The energy secretary nominee isn't feeling the heat of global warming, and he's certainly not feeling the Bern.",2017-01-19,Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has repeatedly pushed Trump's nominees on climate science. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5880ff28170000fa01fdf90d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For at least the third time this week, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) pressed a nominee of President-elect Donald Trump to admit global warming is a crisis.But Rick Perry, nominated to lead the Department of Energy, wouldn’t budge. “Let’s get beyond the rhetoric,” Sanders said. “The majority of scientists who study this issue feel that climate change is a global crisis. It’s not a question of balancing this and balancing that. It’s a global crisis, which requires massive cuts in carbon and the transformation of our energy system. How do you respond to that?”“I like getting past the rhetoric, sir,” Perry responded. “And getting past the rhetoric is looking at the record. It’s important to look at the 12th largest economy in the world while I was the governor because you’re asking me.”Sanders’ tone was notably less fiery than when he probed Rep. Ryan Zinke (R-Mont.), the interior secretary nominee, and Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt (R), Trump’s controversial pick to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. Still, the former Democratic presidential contender cut off Perry.“I’m asking you if you agree with the scientific community that climate change is a crisis and that we need to transform our energy system to protect future generations,” Sanders said, sounding frustrated. “Senator, I will respond that I think that having an academic discussion, whether it’s with scientists or whether it’s with you, it’s an interesting exercise,” Perry said. “But I do have a record of affecting the climate in the world and in this country.”Texas slashed greenhouse gas emissions from carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide during his 14-year tenure as governor, Perry said. “Do you think that’s a good thing?” he asked Sanders. “I think that a better thing would be for you to say right now that you recognize that we have a global crisis and that the United States of America should help lead the world, working with China, Russia and countries around the world to transform our energy system,” Sanders said. He then moved on to questions about nuclear proliferation.Study after study shows the planet is rapidly warming as the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere skyrocketed after humans started burning coal, oil and gas on an industrialized scale. The science behind climate change has proved relatively uncontroversial in most countries, but the Republican Party, backed by oil industry-funded research, has championed a skeptical view for decades. Separate analyses by two federal agencies released Wednesday show that 2016 was the hottest year on record.On climate change, a handful of Trump nominees have broken with the president-elect, who has called global warming “a hoax.” Zinke, Pruitt and Rex Tillerson, the nominee for secretary of state, each acknowledged in their confirmation hearings that the climate is changing, but stopped short of blaming burning fossil fuels. The nominees each employed a version of what Mother Jones called Republicans’ favorite excuse on global warming: “I’m not a climate scientist.” Perry, too, made the same excuse earlier in the hearing when pressed by Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) on climate science. “Far from me to be sitting before you today and claiming to be a climate scientist,” Perry said.“I don’t think you’re ever going to be a climate scientist,” Franken replied. “You’re going to be the head of the Department of Energy.”Perry grinned.“And I’m going to hire really good scientists,” he said.

He embraced the big and the small, highbrow and lowbrow, old and new.

He has embraced anything from big blockbusters, like “The Martian,” in which Matt Damon learns how to grow potatoes on Mars, which Obama named his favorite film of 2015; to small independent movies, like “Little Men,” a coming-of-age story set against the effects of gentrification in Brooklyn, which the Obamas reportedly watched on their most recent summer vacation.Appropriately (but perhaps prematurely), Obama’s life has already gotten the cinematic treatment. The last year of his presidency brought two movies about his formative years: “Barry,” depicting his time as a soul-searching student at Columbia, and “Southside With You,” about his first date with Michelle (which included — fittingly — seeing Spike Lee’s monumental 1989 film, “Do the Right Thing,” which had just opened).

Not positive.” When asked if he had any advice for Kane, he said: “Get yourself a different woman.”"

Speaking at his final press conference at the White House on Wednesday, however, President Barack Obama appeared optimistic about the future of LGBTQ rights moving forward, noting that he didn’t think milestones like same-sex marriage would be “reversible” during Trump’s presidency, or beyond. “American society has changed ― the attitudes of young people in particular have changed,” he said. Pointing to the ongoing struggle for transgender rights in particular, he added, “There’s still going to be some battles that need to take place [but] if you talk to young people ― even if they’re Republicans, even if they’re conservative ― many of them would tell you, ‘I don’t understand how you would discriminate against somebody because of sexual orientation.’ That’s just sort of burned into them in pretty powerful ways.” Watch a snippet of Obama’s comments, tweeted by BuzzFeed’s Tom Namako, below. While Obama said he “couldn’t be prouder” of the work he’s done on the LGBTQ community’s behalf, he wouldn’t accept full responsibility for it. “The primary heroes in this stage of our growth as a democracy and as a society are all the individual activists and sons and daughters and couples who courageously said, ‘This is who I am, and I’m proud of it,” he said. Check out more of Obama’s comments on the LGBTQ community below. It was a final, profound moment from Obama, who leaves behind a monumental legacy as far as LGBTQ rights is concerned, and could very well be the last time a sitting U.S. president speaks so directly to the queer community for a while.

She was shot as police sought Loyd for the December murder of his pregnant former girlfriend.Orlando Police Chief Police John Mina said officers had surrounded an abandoned home with Loyd inside on Tuesday evening. He emerged in body armor carrying two handguns, one of them a Glock with a 100-round magazine, and surrendered after resisting arrest, Mina said.“Great police work got this cop killer off the street,” Mina told a news conference, adding that local, state and federal officers had worked round the clock to crack the case.Loyd was placed in Clayton's handcuffs, a move that Mina said was part of police tradition. He said officers broke down in tears on hearing he had been captured.Online video footage showed Loyd, his face bloodied and eyes swollen, being hustled into police headquarters by sheriff's deputies and police, some of them masked. ""They beat me up,"" he shouted to reporters outside the building.Clayton, a decorated 17-year veteran of the Orlando Police Department, was shot while responding to a sighting of Loyd at a Walmart store.She exchanged fire with Loyd, who was wearing body armor and continued to fire when Clayton was down, police have said. Clayton died at a hospital and was posthumously promoted to lieutenant.Loyd fled the shooting scene in a car and fired at a deputy who tried to the stop him, authorities said. The deputy was unharmed.The U.S. Marshals Service placed Loyd on its list of 15 most-wanted fugitives on Tuesday.An Orange County sheriff's deputy in the manhunt for Loyd was killed in a collision last week between his motorcycle and a van.Mina said investigations would continue into how Loyd was able to evade police in recent weeks. Police have said three people were arrested in Florida on charges of having helped Loyd avoid capture."

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) doesn’t appear to have much faith in Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt’s statement that he doesn’t believe climate change is a “hoax.”In a heated exchange during Pruitt’s Wednesday confirmation hearing, Sanders grilled Pruitt, President-elect Donald Trump’s choice to lead the Environment Protection Agency, on his climate change record. Sanders began by asking Pruitt whether he believed climate change is caused by carbon emissions linked to human activity.“So you are applying for a job as administrator for the EPA, to protect our environment, an overwhelming majority of scientists say we have got to act boldly and you’re telling me there needs to be more debate on this issue and we should not be acting boldly?” Sanders asked.The Vermont senator went on to ask a pair of pointed questions aimed at Pruitt’s personal opinion on climate science, which the nominee dodged, saying: “My personal opinion is immaterial to the job.”That response appeared to openly frustrate Sanders, who noted that the “vast majority” of scientists have come to agreement that climate change is directly caused by human activity.Pruitt went on to say that he believes regulating carbon dioxide emissions is “an important role” for the incoming EPA administrator, but Sanders appeared to be unimpressed, concluding his speaking time by stating that Pruitt would not have his vote.Pruitt’s previous expressions of climate change skepticism raised concerns among environmentalists ahead of Wednesday’s hearing.In May, Pruitt claimed that climate science is “far from settled” in a National Review op-ed he cowrote with Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange (R).In that piece, Pruitt and Strange labeled a group of Democratic attorneys general ― who are investigating allegations that Exxon Mobil and other gas and oil companies misled their investors and the public on the risk of climate change ― a “climate-change gang” working to “intimidate citizens into silence.”Pruitt has also participated in what the New York Times described as an “unprecedented, secretive” alliance with oil and gas companies, accepting large donations from the industry while pushing for softer environmental regulations of the industry.Meanwhile, two federal agencies, NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, announced earlier Wednesday that 2016 marked the third consecutive year that the planet reached record-high temperatures, and the 40th year in a row of above-average global temperatures.―-Joseph Erbentraut covers promising innovations and challenges in the areas of food and water.

OneWest, previously known as IndyMac, profited from an array of unethical practices at the height of the financial crisis, including reportedly evicting a 90-year-old woman over 27 cents. Regulators say the bank also gave predatory loans to the elderly while Mnuchin was at its helm.The 30-second spot, which will air this week in Arizona, Nevada, Iowa and Washington D.C., features an emotional appeal from Lisa Fraser, who says OneWest foreclosed on her home as her husband, John, was dying.“John spent his last days terrified I’d be homeless,” Fraser says. “And then they kicked me out right after the funeral.” The ad is reminiscent of spots Democrats produced during the 2012 presidential campaign that portrayed Romney as a corporate raider who wanted to make himself personally rich at the expense of regular Americans.One Obama campaign ad claimed that Bain Capital, the private equity firm Romney led, killed off jobs at a steel plant after taking it over. Another ad featured a steelworker whose wife died after he lost his job and health care. The man accused Romney and Bain Capital of making “millions for themselves” by closing the plant.PCCC co-founder Stephanie Taylor similarly accused Mnuchin of caring for nothing but his bottom line.“Mnuchin is the poster child for how Trump is betraying America’s working families, including his own voters, by turning over our economy to Goldman Sachs bankers and giant corporations. Mnuchin represents corruption and he should not be running our economy, period,” she said.Allied Progress, a group focused on holding Wall Street accountable, is supplementing the television ad with a campaign to distribute mailers in states like Nevada and Arizona. The mailer will go out to zip codes hardest hit by the 2008 foreclosure crisis, and claims that OneWest foreclosed on 3,826 homes in Arizona and 3,686 homes in Nevada.The Senate Finance Committee is scheduled to consider Mnuchin for treasury secretary on Thursday. Trump’s transition team is reportedly worried about his readiness for the hearing, but did not immediately return a request for comment."
62,POLITICS,Ray Buckley Wants To Be The DNC’s Organization Man,Daniel Marans and Zach Carter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ray-buckley-dnc-race_us_587fa892e4b0cf0ae8815a44,The New Hampshire Democratic Party chair is hoping experience beats charisma.,2017-01-18,"Ray Buckley, chair of the New Hampshire Democratic Party, takes the stage to address a forum on the future of the Democratic Party, Dec. 2, 2016, in Denver.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587faad71700002e00fdf4d1.jpeg?cache=LpoJ1rHOvy&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The Democratic National Committee requires a chair to be the public face of the party, representing Democrats on television and at major political events.At the same time, the chairmanship is primarily a managerial post with more mundane responsibilities: recruiting candidates, raising money and devising winning election strategies.New Hampshire Democratic Party chair Ray Buckley, a long-shot candidate to head the national party, is hoping that the DNC’s 447 voting members put more weight on the latter criteria.“I am the guy that can actually do the job. There is a lot of folks, either thinking about running or running, who have never even been to a Democratic National Committee meeting,” Buckley said.Buckley lacks the national name recognition and the charisma of the race’s front-runners, Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) and Labor Secretary Tom Perez.But he’s had a formidable amount of experience as a party official, beginning at age 18 when he became head of his local county party in New Hampshire. He has been the state’s party chair since 2007, and the president of the association of state Democratic Party chairs since 2009. From 1986 to 2004, he was a member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives.Find out everything you need to know about the DNC race.From a party standpoint, Buckley’s experience in New Hampshire has been relatively successful. Despite the state’s past Republican leaning, Democratic women now occupy all four of New Hampshire’s U.S. House and Senate seats, and the state went for Hillary Clinton in the presidential election.A sore point was the loss of the state’s governorship in 2016. But overall, Democrats have won 11 of the last 13 statewide races, Buckley noted.“We are now firmly purple, leaning a little blue,” he said.Buckley’s biggest criticism of the DNC is a familiar one: He argues the party has abandoned the 50-state strategy that ushered in major Democratic sweeps in 2006 and 2008. That’s mainly been a matter of the DNC reducing the money it gives to state parties since 2008, according to Buckley. He also argues that the party spends far too much on television advertising as opposed to on-the-ground organizing.“New Hampshire proves that, because I have been able to raise the funds and continue the programs that we started in those years,” Buckley said. “So we have the ground operation, unlike some of the purple states who were unable to withstand that surge that Donald Trump had.”Without disparaging President Barack Obama outright, Buckley appeared to echo many party officials’ criticism of Obama’s decision to create the independent fundraising outfit Organizing for America.“They believed honestly that they were transforming politics,” he said. “We now look back... and realize that perhaps 2010 would have been better if we actually had a more robust ground operation within all the state parties.” Even as the DNC race is widely viewed as a proxy fight between supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and supporters of Clinton, Buckley demurred when asked to characterize his ideological tendencies. Instead, Buckley, who is openly gay, ticked off his strong record of fighting for LGBT rights, the environment and organized labor.The veteran New Hampshire operative also shied away from populist pronouncements, including specific ideas for reducing the power of large donors over the party.Buckley would not say whether he plans to reinstate the ban on lobbyist donations to the DNC. “I would ask the executive [committee] to have a thorough discussion about that,” Buckley said.Ellison has promised to push for the ban, while his fellow hopefuls Perez and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, have declined to make a similar commitment.In explaining his approach to lobbyist donations, Buckley took a clear dig at Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), whose stint as DNC chair was marred by charges that she stacked the primary debate schedule for Clinton.“Our problem that we’ve had in the party is that whoever’s been chair has unilaterally made way too many decisions, whether it’s the debate schedule” or other matters, Buckley said.“The important part, and that’s part of my reform package for the DNC, [is] that the chair simply shouldn’t be the only person that decides what kind of money that we’re gonna take, or really any of those large policy decisions,” he added.The Huffington Post is hosting a DNC debate on Jan. 18 at the Jack Morton Auditorium at George Washington University.

Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), author of the 2012 STOCK Act that bars insider trading by members of Congress, also asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate.A Senate committee has scheduled a confirmation hearing for Price on Wednesday amid a barrage of news stories raising questions about his stock trading while in office.Kaiser Health News reported on Friday that Price received shares of an Australian biotechnology firm at a discounted rate not available on the open market. CNN reported on Monday that Price invested in a medical device manufacturer prior to introducing legislation specifically tailored to help that company. On Tuesday, Time reported that Price had purchased shares in six health care companies in 2016 while introducing legislation those companies lobbied to enact. The Wall Street Journal reported last month that Price had traded around $300,000 in shares of health care companies while working on legislation that would directly affect their bottom lines.Price has claimed that his stock trades were made from a broker-directed fund operated by Morgan Stanley. All trades were made by his financial adviser, according to a fact sheet put out by the Trump presidential transition team. A spokesman for Morgan Stanley said the bank does not comment on private client accounts.The Trump fact sheet was released in response to the CNN report that Price introduced legislation to help medical-device maker Zimmer Biomet soon after purchasing stock in the company. The statement said Price’s financial adviser purchased $2,698 in Zimmer Biomet on March 17, 2016. Price reportedly did not learn about the purchase until April 4, 2016 ― 12 days after he introduced legislation to delay a Medicare payment model for a specific medical device manufactured by Zimmer Biomet. Price had made $296 on the trade as of Jan. 13, according to the statement.Price reached an agreement with the Office of Government Ethics to divest his stock holdings upon his confirmation as HHS secretary.Ethics experts told HuffPost that they endorse an investigation into Price’s trades because there aren’t enough public facts to know whether he violated the STOCK Act or House ethics rules regarding conflicts of interest and the acceptance of improper gifts.“I have no idea whether Rep. Price had any insider information,” Common Cause’s Paul S. Ryan, a campaign finance and ethics lawyer, said, referring to the Zimmer Biomet trade.Larry Noble, a lawyer at the Campaign Legal Center and former general counsel to the Federal Election Commission, said Price committed “a possible violation” of the STOCK Act “if he knew that he was going to introduce the bill, it was not public he was going to introduce the bill, he buys stock immediately before that, and then introduces it and that helps it go up.”House conflict-of-interest rules ban lawmakers from participating in government matters that could affect their financial interest.Ryan noted there’s an exemption for ownership of publicly traded stock worth less than $15,000. Nearly all of Price’s health care company stock trades, including Zimmer Biomet, were for less than $15,000.A major exception was Price’s purchase of Innate Immunotherapeutics shares for between $50,001 and $100,000. Both Price and Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) received a below-market price when they bought shares in the Australian biotech company through a private placement, according to Kaiser Health News. The shares have since appreciated more than 400 percent.Lawmakers are barred from participating in initial public offerings not open to the broader public, Ryan said. Noble said other rules may apply, “If they’re giving him a discounted price, that seems like it would be a gift and covered by the ethics rules.”The Innate Immunotherapeutics stock purchase was the subject of the letter sent by Warren, Baldwin and Franken. The senators ask Price to disclose all information related to his purchase of the shares, including how he learned about the private placement and participated.Gillibrand’s letter asks the SEC to investigate Price’s purchase of shares in Zimmer Biomet. Unmentioned in her request was that Price received a $2,000 contribution from the company’s political action committee after the legislation was introduced.Any ethics investigation into whether Price took action to benefit a company or industry in connection with a campaign contribution is unlikely to go anywhere. In 2011, the House Ethics Committee dismissed charges that Price and six other congressman from both parties created an appearance of impropriety by holding fundraisers with the financial services industry just days after voting in committee to weaken the Dodd-Frank banking reform law."

Only one in five Americans would repeal the law immediately, the poll found.Republicans were sharply divided, with 25 percent of those polled wanting to keep it intact or fix problem parts. Some 32 percent would repeal it immediately, while 44 percent would wait to repeal it once an alternative plan is ready to go.“There is some recognition, even from Republican supporters, that the underlying goals of the law are worthwhile,” said Jack Hoadley, a research professor at Georgetown University’s Health Policy Institute. “They still want something done, they don’t want it to disappear.”About 10 percent of Democrats polled would keep the 2010 law as it is and another 70 percent want it to remain intact with some fixes. Some 19 percent of them want the law repealed, including 13 percent who want a replacement passed first.Respondents interviewed by Reuters said they want the U.S. Congress to address problems such as the rising cost of healthcare but even many Republicans who have insurance don’t want it scrapped without a replacement.“I’m afraid if you just repeal, people will lose it,” said Kathy Dugas, a Republican who works as a dietician near Jackson, Mississippi, which has one of the country’s highest obesity rates. “Healthcare should be about people, not about politics,” she said. “There has to be something to take care of people.”Some congressional Republicans have expressed concern about starting a repeal absent clarity about how to replace provisions of the complicated and far-reaching law, but Congress is under pressure from Trump to act quickly.On Friday, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a fiscal 2017 budget by a vote of 227-198, nearly along party lines, that establishes a reconciliation procedure to shield an Obamacare repeal from Senate filibusters.The Reuters poll mirrors findings from a poll released in early January by the Kaiser Family Foundation that also found the public divided: Almost half the people in that poll wanted the law repealed but 28 percent of that group want to know the details of the replacement before Obamacare is scrapped.The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English in all 50 states. The question on Obamacare included responses from 2,232 American adults, including 951 Democrats and 879 Republicans. It has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 2 percentage points for the entire group, and 4 percentage points for the Democrats and Republicans.(Reporting by Jilian Mincer Editing by Caroline Humer and Chris Kahn and James Dalgleish)"

The camera holds an hour and six.,2017-01-18,"Woody Harrelson and Owen Wilson arrive at the ""Free Birds"" Los Angeles Premiere at Westwood Village Theatre on October 13, 2013.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587f6dde1200002d00ad835f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Woody Harrelson’s ambitious upcoming project might just be a total disaster. But a lot of people are working to make sure it’s not.“Lost in London Live,” a comic recollection written by Harrelson himself chronicling a real-life misadventure in the English city, will stream in theaters across the U.S. on Thursday as it’s filmed live, in one shot, across the pond.With the help of Fathom Events, a production company responsible for theater showings of live concerts, fine arts performances and sporting events, the movie will be filmed in 14 locations within a two-mile radius in central London. It’ll use just one camera, which will need to properly connect to 54 separate receivers throughout the filming in order to transmit footage to audiences.According to John Rubey, the event company’s CEO, around 400 crew members will be on hand to ensure the spectacle ― which stars Owen Wilson and Willie Nelson alongside Harrelson ― goes according to plan. But it will be a tough assignment.For starters, the film is an hour and five minutes long. The single camera that will be used to shoot the movie can only hold an hour and six minutes’ worth of data, Harrelson has stated. Any filming delays might present technical problems that would be witnessed throughout hundreds of theaters.But, as Rubey suggested, not knowing what could happen contributes to an “energy” that’s all part of the draw. “It’s kind of the same thing that drives sports,” Rubey told The Huffington Post about the medium of live film, “and that’s uncertainty of the outcome.”He added, “If you think about Woody, Owen and Willie having something unpredictable happen, it sounds like a lot of fun.”The film is billed as a first-of-its-kind experience, providing theatergoers with a fictionalized story that will begin around 2 a.m. local time for a 9 p.m. EST debut. The most difficult shots, Rubey said, surround scenes shot from moving vehicles that also include dialogue, which appear “a couple of times” in the script.Actors and crew members have been rehearsing scenes from the film since December. Because the project requires streets to be shut down, however, full run-throughs have been more limited. The first full rehearsal happened on Monday. “It’s never been done before, and there’s probably a reason for that, but we’ll see if it turns out good,” Harrelson says, with his signature drawl, in the video above. He’s explained that his inspiration for the project was a result of his dual appreciation for theater and film, and a desire to combine the two. Realizing that theater requires a live audience brought him to Fathom Events. “And that’s the kind of ‘eureka’ moment I might regret for the rest of my life. Unless it’ll be great, in which case, I’ll be really glad I had the thought,” Harrelson says above.“Lost in London Live” hits theaters nationwide on Jan. 19. Find tickets through Fathom Events."

For families like Um Mahmoud’s, Syria’s frontlines have even invaded their homes. The 46-year-old mother has seen her three sons join opposing sides of the war and has been unable to stop them from turning on each other.Her story is just one example of how the war has torn families apart for countless reasons. Some families have been divided by ideological differences and political affiliations. Other families have fled the country and been scattered across borders.Um Mahmoud blames herself for the bad blood between her sons, she told Syria Deeply from her home in Damascus. Before the war, 35-year-old Mahmoud worked as a plumber, 32-year-old Kamel worked at a car-rental shop and 23-year-old Hadi had just graduated from business school. Um Mahmoud encouraged her sons to join the popular demonstrations against the government of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad in 2011.“I still remember how I woke them up every day to join the demonstrations,” she said.In the early months of the civil uprising in Syria, the largely peaceful protests were quickly met with a brutal crackdown from the government, which gradually gave way to the emergence of an armed opposition fighting against Assad’s regime.Even then, Um Mahmoud continued to support her eldest and youngest sons, Mahmoud and Hadi, when they decided to join the armed opposition in November 2013. As the armed opposition began to take control of territory on the outskirts of Damascus, Mahmoud and Hadi joined the ranks of the Free Syrian Army (FSA) fighting the Syrian government in the capital’s suburban al-Qaboun neighborhood. There, they fought side by side, and they later moved to the fight in Jobar neighborhood.Soon after, increasing sectarianism and the emergence of more hardline factions saw a splintering of rebel groups under the banner of the FSA.These more extreme groups – most notably the group now known as the so-called Islamic State (ISIS) – began fighting more moderate factions. Taking advantage of the power vacuum left by opposition infighting, ISISmilitants were able to advance in the Damascus suburbs.Um Mahmoud realized the situation was spiraling out of control and begged her sons to put down their weapons, even offering them money to leave the country. They refused. Hadi continued to fight alongside the rebels, and Mahmoud joined a faction affiliated with ISIS in the Damascus suburb of Tishrin.“There was intense fighting between the two groups,” Um Mahmoud said. “I prayed every night that they would not face each other on the battlefield.”Her prayers were answered, and the two brothers never fought each other. Yet, Mahmoud was eventually killed in June 2015, during clashes between the rebels and ISIS. His brother Hadi had not participated in fighting that day.“We both joined to fight for the same goal,” said Hadi. “I tried many times to stop him from joining the Islamic State, but he never listened to me.”While both his brothers were battling pro-government forces and each other, Um Mahmoud’s middle and married son, Kamel, had refrained from taking up arms, though he had sided quietly with the opposition in the beginning of the conflict. In January 2015, however, he was arrested at a government checkpoint, and detained for seven months at the notorious air-force intelligence security branch.Throughout this period, Um Mahmoud lost contact with Kamel, unsure of where he was being held. The family later learned that he was released from prison, but had been forced to join the government’s military reserve service.Hadi, who was still fighting alongside the rebels, did not have direct communication with his brother for some time. Until one day, despite his fears that the government had tapped the rebels’ lines of communication, Hadi attempted to contact his faction’s operations room over the radio. On the other end, he heard “a voice that I knew so well. It was my brother’s,” Hadi said. “It felt like he wanted to talk to me in particular.”But when the voice spoke and threatened him, Hadi realized his brother was no longer the same man he had known. “He ordered me to surrender … as if he was brainwashed. It felt like the person on the other side of the call was not my brother. When he threatened to kill me, I got really angry and I threatened to kill him, too. if we met each other face to face.”Government and rebel forces have since reached a truce in al-Qaboun where Hadi and Kamel are stationed, but the two brothers still do not speak.The divides created throughout the war are so deep that even when the bullets stop, many shattered families will probably not be able to put the pieces back together, and their loved ones may never be reunited. Though Um Mahmoud has already lost one son, she still holds on to hope that the love of a mother is enough to bring what remains of her family back together.“Mahmoud, Kamel, and Hadi are my beloved children. Since the day their father died, I became everything they had,” she said. “I love each and every one of them, regardless of their political affiliations.”This article originally appeared on Syria Deeply.

According to Deadline, the filmmaker’s attorney called their criticisms “unjustified.”PREVIOUSLY: France’s National Film Academy declared Wednesday that it is “proud to present” Roman Polanski, a prominent filmmaker who once pleaded guilty to having unlawful sex with a minor, as the new president of its annual Cesar Awards ceremony.Polanski, whom Cesar Academy President Alain Terzian praised as “an insatiable aesthete,” was charged with a string of sex-related offenses by a 13-year-old girl when he was 43, including perversion, sodomy and rape by use of drugs.The director denied all accusations in a Los Angeles courtroom, but later accepted a plea bargain with a lesser charge before fleeing the country in 1978 to avoid imprisonment.Polanski has been wanted in the United States for nearly 40 years since relocating to France, where he is a citizen and there exists a no extradition treaty. The U.S.’s attempts to extradite him from Switzerland and Poland have been unsuccessful. When Polanski was arrested in Zurich for an outstanding U.S. arrest warrant while en route to a Swiss film festival in September 2009, the Cesar Academy signed a petition calling it a “police trap” and demanded his immediate release. He walked free in July 2010.Now 83, Polanski is set to deliver opening and closing speeches while presiding over the Feb. 24 ceremony in Paris, which is viewed as the French equivalent of the Oscars. Far from a stranger to the academy, the filmmaker has won eight Cesar awards including Best Director for his film “Venus in Fur” in 2014. He also won Best Director in 2003 at the Oscars for his film “The Pianist.”Polanski’s appointment at the Cesar ceremony has already spurred widespread shock and anger online. Twitter users created the trending hashtag #BoycottCesar, and are demanding to know why a man accused of statutory rape is being honored with such a prestigious role. The above tweet reads: Roman #Polanski, accused of raping a minor, in exile for 40 years to escape justice, will preside #César2017 #BoycottCesarThe above tweet reads: #BoycottCesar, because we must not tolerate the intolerable.The above tweet reads: Should there be a boycott following the nomination of Roman Polanksi [as] president of the 42nd Cesar ceremony?Need help?

Normally, polls focusing on the White House are unavoidably tinted to some extent by partisanship. But the current transition period offers a brief eclipse of sorts, as it’s less clear whether questions about the presidency bring to mind President Barack Obama or President-elect Donald Trump.Exactly who the respondents are thinking about turns out to matter. Both men are seen as fair game ― asked specifically about the propriety of criticizing either leader, just 21 percent of Americans say criticizing Obama is inappropriate, and only 19 percent that criticism of Trump is inappropriate.Unlike the reactions to the broader question, however, responses show a definite partisan edge.Democrats say by a 55-point margin, 72 percent to 17 percent, that it’s appropriate to criticize Trump. They say the same of Obama by a much smaller 28-point margin, 59 percent to 31 percent. On the opposite side, Republicans say by a 52-point margin, 69 percent to 17 percent, that criticism of Obama is appropriate.

Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) meets supporters after a town hall meeting on Dec. 22, 2016, in Detroit. Seeing Ellison speak there helped win over Michigan Democratic Party chair Brandon Dillon.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587ec3c51200003e0aad8292.jpeg?cache=TXHf1HBLPt&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President-elect Donald Trump won the election thanks to narrow victories in three historically Democratic states: Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.There are multiple ways that Trump could have won, even if Hillary Clinton had kept one or more of those states in the Democratic column. But the loss by some 100,000 votes of the Northern industrial states that had not gone Republican in a presidential election since 1988 ― part of the so-called blue wall ― has been the cause of especially contentious soul-searching. It is no surprise then that Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), a leading candidate to chair the Democratic National Committee, is fighting hard to whip up support from DNC officials in these key states.In Wisconsin and Michigan at least, his work appears to be paying off. Head over here to learn everything you need to know about the DNC race.Ellison publicized the endorsement of 32 prominent Wisconsin Democrats on Friday, including Sen. Tammy Baldwin and no fewer than three of the state’s six voting DNC members whose support he needs to win the top spot. Andrew Werthmann, a city councilman in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, announced his support for Ellison that day, joining Wisconsin Democratic Party Chair Martha Laning and Wisconsin state Rep. David Bowen, who had already backed him.In addition, Michigan Democratic Party Chairman Brandon Dillon endorsed Ellison on Thursday. Washtenaw County Commissioner-elect Michelle Deatrick, a fellow Michigan DNC voter, was already in Ellison’s corner. Ellison’s boosters in these crucial swing states point to his energy and organizing acumen in explaining their decision to get behind his candidacy.“His record of winning elections in Minnesota and driving up turnout in his district speaks a lot to his ability to organize,” Dillon said.The number of voters in Ellison’s Minneapolis district indeed rose by 13,000 between 2010 and 2014, at a time when Democrats drew pitiful turnout overall. Ellison reached out to Dillon earlier and more often than the other candidates, Dillon added. And the Minnesota Democrat’s Detroit upbringing gives Ellison the “most credibility to be able to deliver on” promises to rebuild Democratic operations in Michigan, according to Dillon, who previously represented Grand Rapids in the Michigan state house. Dillon was especially impressed with Ellison’s ability to pack his brother’s Detroit church for a town hall meeting on a rainy December night.“There were a lot of people there who wanted to hear what he had to say,” Dillon recalled. “He was upfront with people about not only needing to embrace new folks in the party, but making sure people working for a long time in Democratic politics feel like there is room for everybody.”Werthmann emphasized the appeal of Ellison’s message in rural parts of the state. Werthmann’s work for Wisconsin state Sen. Kathleen Vinehout’s successful 2006 campaign, when Vinehout drew support among her fellow farmers with calls for single-payer health care, convinced him that a progressive economic message can appeal to voters with other conservative leanings.“We’re not doing a good job organizing in rural areas,” Werthmann said. “I know people who supported Bernie who ended up supporting Trump. The populist message that Ellison is speaking is in line with that.” Both Dillon and Werthmann said they had received far more calls from rank-and-file Democrats asking them to endorse Ellison, than his chief rival, Labor Secretary Tom Perez. The rivalry between Ellison, an early backer of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), and Perez, a prominent Clinton advocate and President Barack Obama’s unofficial favorite in the race, is widely viewed as a proxy battle between the Sanders and Clinton wings of the party.Sanders defeated Clinton in the Michigan primary, in no small part due to his steadfast resistance to international trade agreements.Dillon, who remained neutral during the Democratic presidential primary, studiously avoided portraying his endorsement as the elevation of one faction of the party over another.But the few noticeable policy distinctions between the two front-runners appear to have helped sway Dillon and Werthmann toward Ellison.Ellison’s opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement was “an important consideration,” Dillon said. Perez supported the 12-nation accord, but has claimed he only did so out of loyalty to the Obama administration in which he was serving.Perez “had the same problem Hillary Clinton had in being credible on this issue by virtue of the public position he had to take,” Dillon said.“The trade issue is a big issue not only in itself, but it is one of those things that signals your commitment to other issues and whose side you’re going to be on,” he added. “As a party, we need to be much clearer and have no confusion as to where we stand: We stand with workers, middle-class families, the people trying to make ends meet ― and any issue that throws shade on that is a problem.”Werthmann, who supported Sanders in the primary, cited Ellison’s promise to reinstate a ban on lobbyist donations to the DNC. Perez and two of the other five candidates have declined to make a similar commitment.“People in this country want to see a move away from the dominance of big money in politics, and I think a policy like this will open up more opportunity for more small-dollar donations,” he said.Ellison has by no means locked up the three former Democratic strongholds won by Trump, however. He has yet to advertise any major endorsements from voting DNC members in Pennsylvania, the biggest and most reliably Democratic of the trio.Pennsylvania Democratic Party Chair Marcel Groen, a Clinton supporter in 2008 and 2016, said last Friday that he had not made up his mind on who he was backing.But he strongly implied he had ruled out Ellison due to the Minnesota congressman’s outspoken progressive views.“I am looking for someone who unifies the party, who will help us rebuild our political infrastructure, someone who is moderate, someone who ― I’m not looking for someone who gets strong reactions one way or the other,” he said.The Huffington Post is hosting a DNC debate on Jan. 18 at the Jack Morton Auditorium at George Washington University.

My friends think it’s wild, like, ‘What did you do?’”The organization didn’t go easy on “King of Queens” actress Remini, either, even creating a website dedicated to discrediting claims she has made in the series. Remini spent more than 30 years in the group before leaving, and has since dedicated herself to recording those experiences, largely painting them in a negative light.Scientology’s disapproval of the A&E docuseries didn’t hurt ratings, however — Remini’s show gave the network its top premiere ratings in two years.“We’re very proud of her. It’s a courageous thing to do,” Dubuc said of the actress, per The Hollywood Reporter.The network seems to be drawn to controversial social topics and shadowy organizations.At the event, Dubuc also addressed A&E’s canceled docuseries that would have centered around the Ku Klux Klan hate group and individuals’ efforts to break away from it. Originally slated to premiere in January, the project drew ire from many who believed it would give hate speech a nationwide platform and risk normalizing the group’s reprehensible views. Some KKK members furthered the controversy by claiming producers paid them to fabricate scenes that would fit into the show’s narrative.“The investigation is ongoing,” Dubuc said, per THR. “We’re not sure yet where the issues really lay. Clearly there are some issues there.” She went on to add that “stricter guidelines” were needed regarding production of shows."

76,POLITICS,Trump's Commerce Pick Outsourced Thousands Of Jobs And Oversaw A Deadly Coal Disaster,Alexander C. Kaufman and Ben Walsh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/wilbur-ross-outsourcing_us_587ea1eae4b01cdc64c85ff4,The billionaire private equity mogul may face some uncomfortable questions at his confirmation hearing.,2017-01-18,"Billionaire investor Wilbur Ross, chairman of Invesco Ltd subsidiary WL Ross & Co, departs Trump Tower after a meeting with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump in New York.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587ea2ad170000fa01fdf29f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President-elect Donald Trump pledged during his campaign to scrap key global trade deals, reverse the flow of manufacturing jobs overseas and bring well-paying mining jobs back to coal country. Those promises may prompt some awkward questions for Wilbur Ross, the billionaire Trump nominated to become commerce secretary, at his Senate confirmation hearing this Wednesday.The 79-year-old private equity mogul earned the nicknames “bottom feeder” and “king of bankruptcy” in the mid-2000s, when he became known for buying up decaying businesses, including steels mills, coal mines and textile factories. At the time the U.S. economy was shedding more than 100,000 manufacturing jobs each year as companies moved factories to countries like China, where labor was cheap and safety and environmental rules were few. Ross reaped profits by stripping workers of health benefits, ignoring safety concerns and sending jobs abroad, where workers expect lower wages. In total, Ross offshored roughly 2,700 jobs at companies he invested in since 2004, according to Labor Department data Reuters published on Tuesday. In 2004, Ross bought Cone Mills, a struggling North Carolina textile company, and combined it with another factory to form International Textile Group. He later renamed the company Cone Denim, and as Bloomberg reported in 2012, expanded production “in less-expensive emerging markets” and moved to “eliminate duplicative facilities.” The firm operated two mills in Mexico and one in China. In 2004, Cone Mills employed 1,100 people. By 2012, the company had just 300 workers in North Carolina, a 72 percent drop. In a scathing retelling of the incident, The Daily Beast dubbed Ross “Trump’s future secretary of outsourcing.”The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a Huffington Post request for comment. Reuters reported that Ross did not respond to several requests for comment.The same year Ross bought Cone Mills, he formed International Coal Group. ICG became the corporate umbrella for mines Ross bought in 2005 from an ailing coal producer called Horizon after a bankruptcy judge stripped thousands of miners, some with black lung disease, of their medical coverage and shredded their union contract.ICG was also the vehicle where Ross placed the assets of Anker Coal Group. Ross had been buying up Anker shares since 1999, and by 2001 he owned 47 percent of the company and was its largest shareholder at 47 percent. ICG fully acquired Anker’s coal assets in 2005. Among the former Anker properties Ross controlled was Sago Mine, which the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration cited in 2005 for 208 violations. (In 2005, two employees joined ICG from Massey, a coal company that became infamous for its disregard for safety regulations under CEO Don Blankenship. In 2010, an explosion at Massey’s Upper Big Branch mine killed 29 workers, and Blankenship was found guilty of conspiring to violate mine safety and health standards and sentenced to a year in prison. Blankenship endorsed Trump for president from prison in 2016.) More than half of the citations at Sago were labeled “serious and substantial,” including 20 dangerous roof falls, 14 power wire insulation problems and three cases of inadequate ventilation plans. On Jan. 2, 2006, an early-morning blast ripped through the mine, trapping 13 miners underground for two days. Only one survived.Ross, who did not leave his Manhattan office to visit the disaster site, said the deaths haunt him. He agreed to pay $2 million, to be divided among the families of the deceased. “He certainly had the authority to try to make a difference and make sure those mines were operated differently. In my view, they were a bunch of dog-hole mines,” attorney Tony Oppegard, a former mine safety official who now represents miners in his private practice, told HuffPost in November. “Bottom line is to get as much coal out as cheaply as possible and get as much coal as possible. That’s what a dog hole is.”Ross may also face sharp question over his willingness to do business with some of Russia’s wealthiest and least savory businessmen. Ross was the leader of a $1.1 billion buyout of a troubled Cyprus bank in 2014 that seemed initially to remove Russian owners from the bank’s list of equity owners. But Mother Jones’ David Corn and Ross Choma noted in December that shortly after the deal was complete, Ross made a deal with Viktor Vekselberg, the oligarch whose ownership of the bank had worried members of the European Union, to allow his company, the Renova Group, to become the second largest shareholder in the bank.After Rex Tillerson was battered in his Senate confirmation hearings for Exxon Mobil’s financial ties to Russia, it would seem likely that senators of both parties would pursue a line of questioning about direct deal-making with one of Russia’s richest men."

After Ross was nominated by Trump, he asked all his household staff to provide such documentation again.“When I was getting ready for this hearing I wanted to recheck all our present and former employees,” Ross said, adding that all but one of about a dozen workers provided the right documentation. “This one employee was unable to and therefore was terminated,” Ross said. The entire process happened in the last month.Ross sorted out the matter in advance of the hearing with committee Chairman Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) and the committee’s top Democrat, Sen. Bill Nelson (Fla.). Both men thanked Ross for being forthcoming about the matter. Ross stressed that all his employees paid the required withholding taxes and that he paid the required employer taxes. He said many of his staff members had become American citizens since 2009. It’s not clear what job the fired employee had in the Ross household. Trump won the presidency with a promise to round up and deport the millions of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. and to build a giant wall along the Mexican border. He called immigrants rapists and drug dealers. So Ross’ employee of seven years faces not only unemployment, but deportation as well. Ross is far from the first nominee who ran into political trouble for having an undocumented worker on the household payroll. Linda Chavez withdrew as President George W. Bush’s nominee for labor secretary in 2001 after a controversy about her sheltering an undocumented immigrant from Guatemala in the 1990s. She said the woman had been in an abusive relationship and in trouble and she wanted to help her.In 1993, Clinton’s choice for attorney general, Zoe Baird, withdrew after senators objected to the fact that she had hired a Peruvian couple for domestic services, even though they were not legally authorized to work in the United States. She also failed to pay Social Security taxes on their wages.Clinton then nominated Judge Kimba Wood to the position, but she too had to withdraw because she had employed an undocumented immigrant as a babysitter."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587e53e1170000880192a91f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The number of “sanctuary” congregations using churches to help shield undocumented immigrants from deportation has doubled since Donald Trump’s election to 800, a coalition of religious leaders said Tuesday.The group of faith leaders attributed the rapid growth in their numbers to the anti-immigrant sentiment that characterized Trump’s presidential campaign. The largely Christian movement ― led by the Church World Service, the PICO National Network, United We Dream, the Advancement Project and Groundswell ― also announced plans to work more closely with the Islamic community in response to Trump’s call to restrict Muslims from traveling to the United States. “Congregations have been knocking down our doors,” Rev. Noel Andersen of the Church World Service said on a call with reporters. “We expect more because of the outcry from our congregations that we’ve heard.” Churches began working on a large scale to protect Central American immigrants from deportation during the civil wars of the 1980s, when hundreds of thousands of people crossed into the United States fleeing violence.Since that time, undocumented immigrants have continued to seek refuge inside the walls of the church, at times taking up residence there to avoid orders of removal. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has a general policy of not carrying out operations in sensitive areas, including places of worship. Ingrid Encalade Latorre, an undocumented mother of two U.S. citizens, said she’d been living for the last seven weeks in Mountain View Friends Meeting, a Quaker church. Born in Peru, she’s lived in the United States since 2000, but was arrested for working with false papers, she said. “I feel thankful to be here,” she said, but added that it’s difficult to see the days go by without being able to accompany her 8-year-old son to school or take her 1-year-old to doctor’s appointments. Christian churches have historically led the sanctuary movement, but Imam Omar Suleiman, the president of the Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research and a professor of Islamic studies at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, said a group of mosques would join the effort in coming days. “Our faith teaches us that all people are worthy of humanity, regardless of documentation,” Suleiman said. The religious leaders said they expected their numbers to continue to grow in the coming months, as their members look for ways to oppose Trump’s efforts to enforce a hard line on immigration.“Our congregations are concerned about their immigrant neighbors,” United Methodist Church Bishop Minerva Carcaño said. “They’re saying, ‘What can we do?’” "
79,POLITICS,One Of The Most Conservative States Could Soon Offer Equal Pay,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/equal-pay-mississippi_us_587e3c74e4b0f63fcfa311d3,All is not lost.,2017-01-17,The Mississippi State Capitol in Jackson. The state may soon catch up to the rest of the country when it comes to equal pay for women.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587e43e21700009f0a92a8e8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The idea that women and men should be paid equally for the same work should be uncontroversial. Yet, two states in the country offer women no equal pay protections, beyond what’s required by federal law: Alabama and Mississippi.Soon, Alabama might stand alone.In Mississippi, where the average pay for women is the lowest in the country, bipartisan support is growing for two different equal pay bills proposed by Democrats in the state legislature. The momentum in one of the most recalcitrant states for civil rights is a somewhat encouraging sign. Even as so many women prepare for a nationwide demonstration to protest the incoming president, most of the country seems to believe in at least this basic right for women. “This is evidence of growing bipartisan agreement that equal pay is an issue we can all get on board with,” Andrea Johnson, a fellow at the National Women’s Law Center, told The Huffington Post. At this point 48 states either have a specific equal pay law on the books for women or include it in broader discrimination laws. And many states introduced new equal pay measures over the past few years to strengthen existing laws.In 2016, Utah passed an equal pay law and became the last non-Southern state to get on board. The same year, Massachusetts passed an innovative new law prohibiting employers from asking job applicants about their salary history. Those questions often reinforce pay disparities between women and men. You essentially wind up carrying your unfair wage from job to job. New York and California strengthened their pay laws in 2015. For all the momentum on equal pay legislation, however, the gender pay gap between men and women remains. That’s because straight-up discrimination is only one reason women make less than men. There are also biases that lead women into lower-paying professions and biases that depress wages in female-dominated jobs. Women also see their wages fall after they have children ― in part because there is no paid family leave that would let them stay in the labor force. Nevertheless, prohibiting wage discrimination is a necessary part of closing the gap.Earlier this month, Democratic state legislators in Mississippi floated two different equal pay bills. On the first day of the session, State Rep. David Baria proposed a law that would essentially reaffirm federal rules regarding how long a complainant has to file a discrimination claim in court. The following week, female legislators in the state house and Senate put up a different, stronger, equal pay bill.Baria proposed a similar law last year, but it died in committee. This time around, Republicans appear amenable. Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant (R) publicly voiced his support last week for women getting equal pay for equal work. “While the authors have in the past used this and similar bills to score cheap political points, I welcome a serious conversation about the issue,” Bryant said.GOP members of the state house also may be on board. “I have spoken to a few female legislators on the other side of the aisle and they definitely view it as an issue that needs to be addressed,” said Rep. Sonia Williams Barnes, who sponsored the equal pay bill in the state house. “Women are the sole providers in many households in our state,” Barnes said. “For women to be able to care for their families … it’s not a partisan issue.”Women in Mississippi face a huge raft of economic challenges, earning an average $31,110 a year, the lowest pay in the country and only 76 percent of what men make, according to a look at Census data compiled by the American Association for University Women. The wage gap in the state is among the widest in the country.Alabama’s wage gap is about the same as Mississippi’s. The office of the governor did not respond to a call or email from The Huffington Post on the pay issue. Nationwide women make 80 cents on the dollar compared to men. The numbers are worse for women of color. Black women in Mississippi make an average of $25,961 a year, compared to $46,557 for men, according to a 2014 study from the National Women’s Law Center.Put another way, white men earn nearly twice as much as black women in Mississippi.“Mississippi is a very conservative state and there is a real kind of patriarchal cultural dominance here,” said Carol Burnett, the executive director of the Mississippi Low-Income Child Care Initiative. The lack of an equal pay law isn’t that surprising considering the state’s Christian conservative traditions, which conform to traditional beliefs around men and women’s roles, said the 60-year-old Burnett. As one of the first female Methodist ministers in the state, Burnett’s been working on social justice issues for decades.Her group is backing a raft of policy proposals to help women in the state, including better childcare, paid leave, and, of course, equal pay. She’s cautiously optimistic. “It’s a state where there’s a long track record of hostility to equity and civil rights” she said, “and that spills over onto women, as well.” "

Robert E. Lee instead of Martin Luther King Jr. in some business listings in the South.Google noted that some businesses in Alabama, Arkansas and Mississippi might be closed because of state holidays honoring the commanding general of the Confederate Army during the Civil War — failing to mention the federal holiday honoring the civil rights leader.The three states still honor Lee’s birthday 30 years after the federal government established Martin Luther King Jr. Day on the same day of the month each year: the third Monday of January. Lee was born on Jan. 19, 1807; King was born Jan. 15, 1929.Google has issued an apology for the jarring listing and said it was working as quickly as possible to fix the problem. The listings were automatically marked by Google and not by the businesses.“The holiday-hours feature lets people know when a business could be closed,” said a statement emailed to The Birmingham News. “Unfortunately, in the three states where Robert E. Lee’s birthday is recognized as well, the feature is not surfacing Martin Luther King Day as it should be. We apologize for any offense this may have caused. Our teams are working to fix this issue as quickly as possible.”Adena White, the director of communications for the Chamber of Commerce in Conway, Arkansas, told The Daily Dot she noticed Google’s Lee holiday after spotting tweets complaining about it. She tried to change it.“I was able to edit our holiday hours on Google My Business to ‘closed’ but could not edit the reason why,” White said via a message to The Dot. “It appears that state holidays take precedence over federal holidays.”Florida’s Lee holiday is Jan. 19, but it’s not generally observed, and Virginia celebrates Robert E. Lee-Andrew Jackson Day on the Friday before MLK Day."

I believe we should be prudent.”But Sanders abruptly cut him off when he suggested there is a lot of debate “on both sides of the aisle.”“Well, actually, there’s not a whole lot of debate now,” Sanders said. “The scientific community has very truly unanimously declared that climate change is real and causing devastating problems.

Yet environmental groups appear to be less horrified by him than by other nominees, offering tepid support for the lifelong hunter and fisherman.Asked whether he’d support drilling or mining on public lands, Zinke suggested doing so is critical to creating jobs. “We need an economy of jobs, too,” Zinke said, then began to regurgitate a line used earlier in the hearing: “In my experience seeing probably 63 different countries, I’ve seen what happens ―”“I don’t mean to be rude,” Sanders said, cutting him off. “But I’m taking your answer to be yes, we should drill.”Zinke then said he is “absolutely against the transfer or sale of public lands.”“Couldn’t be any more clear,” he added, seemingly frazzled by Sanders’ tone.Sanders then asked Zinke what he planned to do to address the poor access to health care and education available on reservations. In addition to controlling 500 million acres of land and extraction rights on it, the interior secretary oversees relations with Native American tribes and reservations. “As bad as the VA is, Indian health in Montana is worse,” Zinke said, referring to the Department of Veterans Affairs’ notorious record of failure to provide care to wounded soldiers who return home. “It is worse.”Sanders asked whether that acknowledgment meant he plans to prioritize the issue. Zinke said yes. Earlier in the hearing, Zinke noted ongoing protests, led by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, against the Dakota Access Pipeline, which Trump said he supports completing. He chalked up protesters’ fury at being attacked by guard dogs, pepper spray and fire hoses in frigid temperatures to historic tensions between tribes and U.S. authorities. “Last time the Sioux nations got together, I’d say General Custer would probably say that was not a good issue,” Zinke said, referring to George Armstrong Custer, a U.S. Army officer killed during a battle with warriors whose tribes he terrorized and massacred. “There are deep cultural ties. There is a feeling that we haven’t always been a fair consultant.” He stopped short of saying what he’d do to be fairer. "
82,POLITICS,Donald Trump Is Blacklisting His Former Critics From His Transition,Sam Stein and Christina Wilkie,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-blacklist_us_587e2447e4b089722865444f,"It's not just the national security team, either.",2017-01-17,A number of national security figures from the GOP ranks are concerned they are being denied jobs because they were critical of Donald Trump in the past.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587e24e61700009f0a92a86f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― A number of experienced Republicans offering to help Donald Trump assume the office of the presidency have effectively been blacklisted from doing so because they were previously critical of his White House bid. On Monday, The Washington Post reported that numerous national security figures from the GOP ranks were concerned that they were being denied jobs on the transition team and in the incoming administration because they had signed a letter pledging to oppose Trump during the months he was running for the Republican nomination.The ostracism is real, multiple sources told The Huffington Post a few weeks back, and it extends beyond the national security realm. According to these sources ― one of whom works on the transition and another who was prevented from doing so ― Trump’s team has identified people who were highly critical of his candidacy and essentially cut them off from being part of the current operation. In one instance, a Republican official working on the confirmation strategy for EPA secretary nominee Scott Pruitt was removed from that team because he had been a Never Trump-er“Somehow it was relayed to them [that I was helping out], and somebody had a meltdown,” said the officer, who, like other sources, spoke on condition of anonymity. Sean Spicer, the incoming White House press secretary, noted that the transition has had more than 300 volunteers helping to prepare nominees for their hearings and confirmation battles. “The national security team is second to none in terms of their bona fides,” he added. “This sounds more like whining from people who didn’t understand the power of the Trump movement.”Eliot Cohen, a prominent neoconservative figure who clashed with Trump’s team during the campaign and in the early days of the transition, was critical of those officials who spoke to The Washington Post, urging them to either not get involved or not complain at all.  To date, the only major setback that Trump has suffered with respect to staffing his administration has been Monica Crowley ― a conservative TV personality whose appointment to a national security post was scuttled after revelations of widespread plagiarism in her career. Beyond that, Trump’s nominees and appointments appear fairly well positioned for confirmation and the assumption of office. But the unwillingness to bring in former critics ― either on staff or in an advisory role ― does carry larger risks. Beyond the top levels, Trump and his team must fill thousands of political positions with qualified Republicans soon after President Barack Obama leaves office. And as Max Boot, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, noted, the fact that many of these positions appear unfilled at this juncture suggests that the staffing process is plagued by infighting or lack of personnel. Some of the slow pace of mid- to lower-level staffing is attributed to the fact that Republican foreign policy hands are already wary of working for Trump and his incoming national security adviser, Michael Flynn. As one official noted, many of the top GOP operatives in this field have spent years advocating and crafting a worldview diametrically at odds with the pro-Russian tilt of the incoming administration. But bruised egos also seem to be a stumbling block. A source close to the transition pointed to that August letter signed by 50 Republican national security experts warning that Trump “would be a dangerous President, and would put at risk our country’s national security and well-being.” “Those people are not going to get jobs,” said the source, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations."

In a new interview with Variety, the documentarian shared his thoughts about the president-elect, saying the reason he’s been able to stay as politically active as he has is because he’s taken Trump seriously “since day one.” (Moore predicted Trump’s victory last July.)“You do have to take Trump at his word. I still hear people say, ‘Oh, he’s not really going to build the wall.’ Oh, he is going to build it. He knows that he’s got to deliver at least a version of the wall,” Moore said.The “Bowling for Columbine” director also believes Trump will “absolutely” ban Muslims from entering the United States. “He’s going to get away with it by making it a ban on Muslims who come from the following countries,” he said. “He needs just enough cover for his crowd to say, ‘Oh, he’s being reasonable there. He’s not banning all Muslims.’”Moore’s sentiments seem to be an indirect response to Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway, who continually defends the president-elect’s controversial behavior and recently urged journalists to “look at what’s in his heart” instead of taking Trump’s words and actions at face value. Moore admitted that he’s worried about Trump having access to nuclear weapons codes, adding, “I wish he had to go through a psychological evaluation, because I’m pretty sure that it would come out that he is a malignant narcissist.” The director also criticized Trump’s tendency to react to any and all criticism ― including Meryl Streep’s speech at the Golden Globes ― by tweeting snarky retorts instead of focusing on more important issues (like running the country, for example). “With all that’s going on in the world — the shooting in Fort Lauderdale, the shooting of police in Orlando, North Korea saying they have an ICBM that can hit us — and he woke up being consumed with Meryl Streep,” Moore said. Still, the director doesn’t think Americans should be afraid of Trump’s rise. Instead, he urges those who don’t support Trump to “be brave. Be bold. Get up off the couch. Get active. Get involved.” (Moore is practicing what he preaches by leading a rally in New York City this Thursday, ahead of the inauguration.)He continued, “No week should go by without you calling a member of Congress or one of your two senators. Make that part of your weekly routine now. Some people need to think about running for office themselves: school board, city council, precinct delegate. It’s not going to change until some of us start running.” To read more from Moore’s interview with Variety, head here. "
84,MEDIA,New York Times Is Devoting $5 Million More Into Covering Donald Trump,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-york-times-donald-trump-5-million_us_587e524ee4b0aaa36942b676,"""This is not just a story of transformed government agencies,"" editors said. ""It is also about the stability of the global order.""",2017-01-17,Donald Trump praised the New York Times during a visit to the company's headquarters shortly after the election. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587e58501200003e0aad8103.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK ― Just days ahead of Donald Trump’s inauguration, The New York Times announced plans to invest an additional $5 million into its coverage of the incoming president and his administration. “Has there ever been a story more tailor-made for The New York Times?” executive editor Dean Baquet and managing editor Joseph Kahn asked in a Tuesday memo. “Or a moment when our mission was more crystal clear?”The Times top brass announced this allocation of resources into covering Trump and the “new world order” in a memo pegged to the release of an internal report addressing how the paper needs to adapt and thrive in the digital age. Members of the Times’ 2020 group provided a blunt assessment Tuesday of newsroom operations and urged changes in hiring, goal-setting and training to meet the demands of a shifting media landscape and, importantly, the needs of subscribers. The group’s report didn’t specifically mention coverage of Trump, though Baquet and Kahn applauded staff in the accompanying memo for being “out front on the biggest story in a generation, a story that has called on every department and discipline of The Times.”“Our readers want us to dig deeply into the story of Donald Trump’s arrival in Washington,” they wrote. “They are coming to us in record numbers because they know we are one of the few news organizations with the power and fortitude to cover all aspects of this historic shift in American power, and what it says about the country and its deep divisions.”Baquet and Kahn said the Times plans to add investigative journalists and experts in areas such as taxes, immigration, education and climate change. The Times has had a tumultuous, decades-long relationship with Trump, whose seeming attraction to and repulsion with the paper results in a disproportionate share of access and attacks. Timothy O’Brien, a former Times reporter and editor who Trump unsuccessfully sued over a 2005 biography, has suggested the Queens-born developer has “always had a deep fascination with The New York Times and a need to get the paper’s broader approval of his career and who he is.”While Trump privately scolded TV news executives at Trump Tower in November, he praised the Times during a meeting the following day at the paper’s headquarters. “The Times is a great, great American jewel,” Trump said, adding that he hoped they “can all get along.” Surely, Trump won’t always speak so admiringly of the Times, especially given that the paper has already aggressively staffed up to cover his administration and is now promising additional millions for its effort. The Times hired Politico’s Glenn Thrush last month and announced that Peter Baker, a highly regarded reporter who has covered the previous three White Houses, would return from a brief stint as Jerusalem bureau chief to report on Trump’s administration. The Times White House team also boasts reporters Mark Landler, Mike Shear, Julie Davis and Maggie Haberman, who Politico recently dubbed as the reporter most plugged into Trump’s network. A week later, the Times announced the formation of a new Washington D.C.-based investigative team led by veteran national security reporter Mark Mazzetti. Pulitzer Prize-winning reporters like Matt Apuzzo and Eric Lipton are part of the new team, along with award-winning foreign and investigative reporter Sharon LaFraniere and Michael Schmidt, who broke the news that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton used a private email account for government business. In an interview last month with The Huffington Post, Mazzetti framed the creation of a new investigative team as part of the traditional moving of newsroom pieces following a presidential election. Still, he acknowledged the urgency and necessity to prepare for Trump’s arrival.“No matter what your beliefs are politically, everyone agrees there’s a huge story coming to Washington,” Mazzetti said. “We have to be in place to cover it.”Apuzzo separately told HuffPost last month that Trump’s pledge to fundamentally change Washington “requires reporters who will look in depth at the changes being made.”“And at the same time he’s promising all of this change, he’s also found a way to really speed up the news cycle,” Apuzzo said. “He moves at the speed of Twitter. For reporters that can slow down, and dig in and explain things, we’re going to have plenty to do.”Baquet recently told NPR that he wanted to “double down on explanatory and investigative reporting” in Washington because “really interesting things happen” when “unusual figures” arrive in the capital. On Tuesday, Baquet and Kahn expressed a need to not only deeply cover Trump’s impact on Washington, but the broader story of a greatly shifting world order. “This is not just a story of transformed government agencies,” they wrote. “It is also about the stability of the global order that has prevailed since World War II and America’s place in that world.”"
85,POLITICS,Exxon Mobil Makes Its First Big Bet Of The Trump Era,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/exxon-mobil-permian_us_587e2744e4b0d4cc08849093,"The oil giant, whose former CEO is up for secretary of state, is doubling its reserves in the Permian Basin.",2017-01-17,Exxon Mobil Corp. CEO Darren Woods took over in January when Rex Tillerson stepped down. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587e36821700002e00fdf0fc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Exxon Mobil Corp. spent $5.6 billion to double its share of a massive oil and gas reserve to 6 billion barrels in its first big bet since newly minted CEO Darren Woods took over this month. The oil giant bought 3.4 billion barrels of resource from the reserve, which is part of the prolific Permian Basin, an oil- and natural gas-producing area that stretches from western Texas into the southeastern corner of New Mexico.That Woods made his first major acquisition in the multinational behemoth’s home country could be seen as a wager on President-elect Donald Trump’s future energy policies. The incoming president promised to spur an “American energy renaissance” ― to use the bubbling words of the country’s top oil and gas lobbying group ― by slashing environmental regulations and subsidies to clean energy companies. He has stacked his Cabinet with nominees that deny climate science and maintain close ties to fossil fuel interests. He even named Woods’ predecessor, Rex Tillerson, as his secretary of state. Shares of oil, gas and coal companies soared after Trump won the presidency in a surprise victory in November. “This acquisition strengthens ExxonMobil’s significant presence in the dominant U.S. growth area for onshore oil production,” Woods, 51, said in a statement Tuesday. Exxon Mobil did not respond to a request for additional comment. The acquired companies ― it’s unclear how many individual firms were included in the purchase ― hold about 275,000 acres of land in the basin, existing production of more than 18,000 net barrels per day, and tracts of land in other parts of the country. The Bass family ― a prominent Fort Worth, Texas-based clan of four brothers Forbes said inherited a small fortune from their oil tycoon uncle four decades ago ― previously owned the companies. The acquisition signals that Woods’ plans for Exxon Mobil won’t veer far from Tillerson’s legacy. Under the 64-year-old, Exxon Mobil rebuffed shareholder efforts to push for more renewable investments and force the company to disclose risks associated with climate change. Tillerson repeatedly mocked clean energy, joking once that he wasn’t “really against renewables” because wind turbine operators bought Exxon Mobil’s oil as a lubricant."
86,POLITICS,"The Media Sucks, But It Still Should Stay In The White House",Howard Fineman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/media-sucks-should-stay-in-white-house_us_587d556ae4b03549ebc02764,"In Washington, symbolism – and proximity – are everything.",2017-01-17,President Barack Obama speaks in the press briefing room of the White House in December. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587d58d61700009f0a92a70f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Let’s stipulate two things right away.One: Americans have lost faith in the press. Two: Much of that faith was drained away either by the press’s own mistakes, or by economic and technological changes that (so far) have done more to undermine the press’s credibility than to enhance it.In one poll last April, for the AP, an astonishingly low 6 percent of voters said that they possessed a lot of confidence in the media. Media mistakes are hideously glaring, and on all sides, on all scales, and all shades of the political spectrum ― from under-covering unjust police tactics used against minorities to utterly missing the rise of Donald Trump in the old industrial states of the North.The structural flaws are growing: “fake news,” ideologically blinkered sites, anonymously floated viral rumors, Russian hacks and leaks, “agnostic” platforms that deliver it all unfiltered to everyone every second, the decay of the idea of facts themselves.We have come a very long way since a half-century ago, when an avuncular, mustachioed TV anchor named Walter Cronkite could end each broadcast by declaring “that’s the way it is” ― and the American public by and large nodded in agreement.But all of that has changed.President-elect Trump has many gifts, one of which is an unerring feral sense of when to manufacture a foe out of someone or something, and then attack the weaknesses of that “foe” to his advantage. He knows precisely how unpopular the media is; even as he rode the press to power like a rented mule, he beat it like a rented mule, too.He is now of two minds about how to proceed.At times, he’s opened the golden spigots of Trumpian charm a bit to provide access and scoops and interviews to favored outlets. He even candidly mused aloud at his first press conference in months last week that it was the press that had made him, and so perhaps it would be in his interest to be respectful.But then he lashed out at BuzzFeed and CNN, seeking to divide the press corps (which he quickly did), and now someone in his inner circle has leaked to Esquire that Trump is going to kick the press corps out of its long-held perch in the White House.There are wise guys in the media itself (they tend to be based in New York) who think the White House press corps is so brain-dead that a physical presence is either meaningless or false advertising.The press area itself looks like a place in need of reform if not fumigation. The familiar little auditorium is built over top of the old White House swimming pool and solarium that connected the house proper to the famous warren of offices in the West Wing. In rooms behind the auditorium, and in the basement, there are dozens of desks and tiny booths for reporters and broadcasters. Cockroaches and rats are known to enjoy the amenities.And now Trump is about to arrive with his tens of millions of social media followers and armies of fervent supporters and unrivaled ability to make worldwide news at the burst of a tweet. Demand for space in the White House probably will grow.Thus the Esquire leak.Sensing a political vulnerability and a logistical excuse, Team Trump thinks it is luring the media into what the public will regard as a whiney, self-serving case of special pleading by hated elites. Why not remove all of that White House mess, and put the press out of the building altogether, to a conference center or building across the street?Well, let me plead: Close physical proximity to the press secretary matters, and is still and only possible in the current arrangement, where his or her office is 100 feet from the auditorium of the press room.The driveway entrance to the West Wing outside the press room is equally important territory, for it is the main way into and out of the building for invited political guests and officials. West Wing offices are for the most part off limits to the hordes in the press room, but those officials sometimes can and do come to meet the media ― and the proximity saves time. The Oval Office itself is only steps away, and presidents have been known to make haste to get to the press room when it serves their purpose.Most important, despite its many flaws and shortcomings, the press still ― and arguably now more than ever ― has an indispensable role to play in what we regard as our representative democracy. Without steady, up close and not-always planned interchange between reporters and officials, the Founders’ idea fails.And then there is the sheer symbolism of it. Don’t laugh, and don’t dismiss it. The White House belongs to all of the American people, and we all have a right ― and even a responsibility ― to know as much as we can about what is going on in the place.Even conservatives know that ― or should. So should the big news network executives and communications CEOs and other honchos of the digital age who have become the pipelines of news even though they don’t want to admit it.In the end, Trump will probably not shut the place down. No one recognizes valuable ― salable ― real estate better than The Donald.Here’s betting he will turn the press room into Mar-a-Lago North. Reporters and news organizations can pay various rates for seats, desks and booths: silver, gold, platinum and titanium.The biggest of the “big-league” outfits can become members of the exclusive Trump Club, featuring front-row briefing room seats, drink and concierge transcription service and 24-hour walk-in access to Sean Spicer, Steve Bannon and a team of spin butlers. It’ll be yuge."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587e13331200002d00ad8008.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump’s voters say they’ll support him in arguments against the congressional GOP. Americans have low opinions of Trump’s transition, but expect him to boost the economy. And the public isn’t too fond of Vladimir Putin...or Congress. This is HuffPollster for Tuesday, January 17, 2017. TRUMP VOTERS ARE MORE LOYAL TO HIM THAN THE GOP - HuffPollster: “President-Elect Donald Trump has never exactly been a paragon of Republican Party orthodoxy. Even before he takes office, he’s been at odds with politicians in his own party over everything from infrastructure and trade policy to strategy on Obamacare and attitudes toward Russia. Voters who elected Trump largely are inclined to take his side in such disputes against congressional Republicans and traditionally conservative pressure groups, according to a new poll….Unsurprisingly, Trump voters overwhelmingly say they’d back him in a dispute against Democrats in Congress. Eighty-four percent say they’d be more likely to agree with the president-elect, with fewer than 1 percent saying they’d be inclined to side with Democrats. But a majority also say they’d be likely to support Trump over both congressional Republicans generally and Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) in particular….Other traditionally powerful voices on the right also fared badly in a hypothetical argument against Trump. Just 13 percent of Trump supporters say they’d be likely to side with conservative commentators, like Bill O’Reilly and Laura Ingraham, over the president-elect, and just 23 percent that they’d be inclined to support evangelical Christian leaders….The one voice that Trump voters prioritized over the president-elect was that of the military.” [HuffPost]TRUMP WILL TAKE OFFICE WITH RECORD UNPOPULARITY - Dan Balz and Scott Clement: “After a tumultuous campaign and transition, President-elect Donald Trump will take the oath of office Friday as the least popular incoming president in at least four decades, but a majority of Americans nevertheless express optimism that he will be able to fulfill campaign pledges to boost the economy and deal with threats of terrorism, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll….As in the campaign, Trump is a polarizing figure who generates great enthusiasm among those who supported him and deep hostility among those who did not….One pattern first seen during the presidential campaign continues to shape attitudes as Trump prepares to become president, which is a division among white Americans based on levels of education. In general, on a series of questions in the new poll, whites without college degrees expressed considerably more support for Trump than whites with college degrees.” [WashPost]Americans OK with Trump keeping his businesses, bothered by his failure to release taxes - More from The Washington Post: “A narrow majority of Americans say Donald Trump should not have to sell his businesses to separate them from his duties as president — but a large majority say the president-elect should release his tax returns, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll. The poll finds 52 percent of those surveyed say Trump’s decision to hand over control of his businesses to his adult sons and another executive ‘is enough’ to separate his business interests from his obligations as president. A somewhat smaller share, 42 percent, say Trump should sell his businesses outright...Trump’s continued refusal to release his tax returns continues to be an unpopular decision, with 74 percent of Americans saying he should make the documents public, including 53 percent of Republicans.Trump said last week that he believes only reporters, and not the broader public, care about his tax returns. The Post-ABC poll finds that roughly 2 in 5 Americans both want to see Trump release of tax returns and say they ‘care a lot’ about him doing so.” [WashPost]CONGRESS REMAINS UNPOPULAR - Riley Brands: “The 115th U.S. Congress begins its term with a 19% job approval rating, similar to the level measured for the institution in recent years and in line with the 18% to 20% ratings it received in the final months of 2016….Although Republicans control both chambers of Congress and are about to control the White House, the party faithful are no more likely than Democrats to approve of the institution, at 20% and 19%, respectively. Independents have a similar view of Congress, with 17% approving of how it is handling its job. This pattern of similarly low party ratings of Congress has generally held for about the last year…. This suggests there is no reservoir of goodwill for Congress to fall back on as it attempts to enact its agenda in the coming months.” [Gallup]PUTIN IS DEEPLY DISLIKED, ESPECIALLY AMONG OLDER AMERICANS - Grace Sparks: “Only 9 percent of voters nationwide have a favorable opinion of Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to a Quinnipiac University survey released Friday. Sixty-eight percent say have an unfavorable view of the Russian leader…. Only 12 percent of Republican respondents have a favorable view of him, compared to 3 percent of Democrats and 10 percent of independents. However, the gap in skepticism about Putin seems to be less of a partisan issue and more a matter of age. Sixty-two percent of people between 18 and 34 years old ― a group that tends to be more Democratic ― have an unfavorable view of Putin. But three-quarters of people over 65 ― who are more likely to remember the Cold War, and to be Republican ― don’t have a favorable view of him.” [HuffPost]HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!

Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), a leading candidate to chair the Democratic National Committee, said Monday he would not attend the presidential inauguration in protest of President-elect Donald Trump’s comments about the civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.).Ellison revealed his decision in a series of tweets.Ellison joins a growing number of House Democrats boycotting the inauguration. Some had decided not to attend before Trump attacked Lewis over the weekend. But the number of Democrats shunning the ceremonies has since ballooned to more than two dozen.Lewis, who famously was beaten by police during a 1965 march in Selma, Alabama, that came to be known as Bloody Sunday, said during an NBC interview broadcast Friday that he regards Trump’s presidency as illegitimate and won’t attend the inauguration.“I don’t see this president-elect as a legitimate president,” Lewis told Chuck Todd, host of NBC’s “Meet The Press.” “I think the Russians participated in helping this man get elected and they have destroyed the candidacy of Hillary Clinton.”Trump responded with several tweets attacking Lewis, claiming the Atlanta congressman was “all talk, talk, talk ― no action or results.”Ellison is scheduled to attend Democratic power broker David Brock’s gathering of party fundraisers, strategists and other leaders in Florida on Saturday. Four other DNC candidates also are to appear at the meeting, which Brock bills as an attempt to build a liberal counterweight to the Koch brothers’ political donor network, according to BuzzFeed.Ellison had planned to attend the inauguration until Trump erupted at Lewis, said Brett Morrow, a spokesman for Ellison’s DNC campaign. Labor Secretary Tom Perez, also a candidate for DNC chair, won’t attend the inauguration, either, according to spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa. Hinojosa did not immediately respond to a request for clarification about Perez’s reasons.Ellison, co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and an early backer of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ presidential bid, hopes to lead the DNC as it rebuilds after the party’s 2016 election losses. He enjoys the support of not only Sanders and many of his top backers, but key Clinton advocates, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.).Perez, whose time as labor secretary and head of the Department of Justice civil rights division have made him a progressive star in his own right, has the backing of four Democratic governors and several labor unions. President Barack Obama has all but endorsed him.In addition to Ellison and Perez, the DNC race includes South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg; New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman Ray Buckley; South Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Jaime Harrison; Idaho Democratic Party Executive Director Sally Boynton-Brown; and media strategist Jehmu Greene.The DNC’s 447 voting members will select the next chair on Feb. 25 in Atlanta.The Huffington Post will host a debate between the DNC candidates on Wednesday in Washington.The Huffington Post is hosting a DNC debate on Jan. 18 at the Jack Morton Auditorium at George Washington University.

ANY inauguration.",2017-01-17,"Oh, say, can you see ... any musicians willing to play inaugural celebrations?",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587e0033170000fa01fdf06f.jpeg?cache=V8AOZiLWjE&ops=crop_353_209_2757_2001%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Their fans, like so many others in the lead-up to President-elect Donald Trump’s inaugural celebrations, weren’t happy with the news. But ‘80s tribute band The Reagan Years will ignore that criticism to perform at a ball honoring the incoming president this week.A founding member of the five-person band, Sy Seyler, told The Hollywood Reporter that their choice was made in light of the group’s view that the event is merely “a celebration of the democratic process.” “We took quite a shellacking from people saying, ‘How dare you support this bigot, womanizer, horrible man,’” Seyler, a drummer and singer, told the publication. The band will play at the sold-out All American Inaugural Ball on Thursday night at Washington, D.C.’s Hyatt Regency Capitol Hill hotel, one of several “unofficial” balls celebrating the swearing-in ceremony on Friday. The official inaugural balls ― at least three ― will take place that evening. A long list of celebrities including Elton John, Andrea Bocelli, Celine Dion, Jennifer Holliday and Charlotte Church have declined to participate.Seyler clarified that the name Reagan Years has nothing to do with the group’s politics, just a desire to play at an inaugural celebration. (“For the longest time, our slogan was, ‘No voodoo economics, just great music.’”) Admittedly, their Republican-flavored name may have influenced organizers’ decision to pick them this time around.The group has garnered just about 16,200 likes on its Facebook page, and a promo video shows them playing covers of a wide range of songs from Pat Benatar’s “Hit Me with Your Best Shot” to Def Leppard’s “Rock of Ages.”The drummer neglected to state whether he or his bandmates actively support President-elect Trump.

Maj. Greg Lowery, left, and Army Spc. Sara Corry, stand in for the president-elect and his wife during a Sunday dress rehearsal for the inaugural parade.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587e597f1700002e00fdf177.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― A federal appeals court on Tuesday upheld as “content-neutral” a rule that barred an anti-Trump group from protesting along a portion of the inaugural parade route President-elect Donald Trump is expected to traverse on Jan. 20.The Act Now To Stop War and End Racism, or ANSWER, Coalition had challenged the rule, which sets aside “priority” seating for ticketed parade-goers in Freedom Plaza and other areas, as a violation of protesters’ First Amendment rights.But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit said the rule, which covers public spaces along the route that are managed by the National Park Service, doesn’t discriminate against specific viewpoints and thus is constitutional.“The First Amendment requires that any reasonable, content-neutral regulation limiting expression along the parade route leave ample space available for peaceful demonstrations,” explained U.S. Circuit Judge Nina Pillard. “The First Amendment does not, however, support ANSWER’s claim of a right to displace spectator bleachers with its own demonstration at Freedom Plaza.”The unanimous ruling was joined by U.S. Circuit Judges Sri Srinivasan and Patricia Millett; all three judges are appointees of President Barack Obama. ANSWER first filed the case in 2005, prior to the second inauguration of George W. Bush, and the dispute has been ongoing in the courts.“This case presents a controversy likely to arise every four years,” Pillard wrote. She noted that ANSWER “has protested both Republican and Democratic inaugurations” in the past.Under the National Park Service regulation, 13 percent of the 1.2-mile stretch between the Capitol and the White House may be used by the inaugural committee for bleachers to accommodate whoever it pleases. The ANSWER Coalition charged in court that the open area right in front of the route by Freedom Plaza was perfect for a mass demonstration, and that the rule barring demonstrations there meant that the agency “unconstitutionally prefers the government’s message” to any other.Pillard reasoned that the regulation doesn’t displace any particular speaker or point of view because, in theory, anyone in the ticketed area may still adhere to the protesters’ message. And the rule applies to everyone equally.“Nothing in the regulation would prohibit a ticketholder to the Inaugural Committee’s bleacher area from publicly endorsing ANSWER’s message,” Pillard wrote. In the same section of the ruling, the judge observed that the rule also allows non-ticketholders to sit in the ticketed area if a particular seat is unclaimed 10 minutes before the parade passes through.“The regulation also equally excludes anyone who might elbow into the reserved area, regardless of whether she or he wishes to protest, show support, or simply get a better view,” she added.Hewing to similar precedents, the court ruled that the regulation ultimately “is a reasonable and content-neutral time, place, and manner regulation of a public forum.”Even though the protesters lost, the court recognized that the ANSWER Coalition already has an answer to its dilemma. It’s secured an alternate permit to demonstrate in a prime spot along Pennsylvania Avenue: the U.S. Navy Memorial Plaza.“We have succeeded in achieving what Donald Trump has tried to avoid at all costs, which is to create space along the Inauguration Route for people to speak out against his right-wing agenda,” read a Jan. 5 news release, which also said the group opposes the incoming “far-right government of billionaire oligarchs and bigots.”A dress rehearsal of the parade with a Trump stand-in was conducted Sunday."

So what if all the movers in San Diego refused them? That was the idea behind it,” Ryan Charles, HireAHelper’s vice president of marketing, told The San Diego Union-Tribune.Charles, speaking to NBC 7, said that in addition to creating the petition, they started to cold-call other moving companies, asking if they’d join their boycott.“The feedback was immediately positive,” he said. “I got chuckles, people were laughing, there were guys saying, ‘I wouldn’t move them for X amount of dollars.’”It’s not only San Diego companies that have dug their heels into the ground, however. At least eight Los Angeles-based companies have also signed on, according to the petition’s website.In another Charge.org petition, nearly 5,000 people have signed against the team’s brand leaving San Diego. If they have to go, the represented fans ask that the team’s name be changed to something else.“Dean Spanos should be free to move his team and his business to LA, but he should NOT be allowed to take our history and all the goes along with being a Charger and Fan with him,” the petition states. “The Chargers name should stay and belong to San Diego should we ever form another team and Dean Spanos should be forced to find a new team name in LA.”A request for comment from the Chargers Tuesday on the petition was not immediately returned."

Co-authored by the prince, environmentalist Tony Juniper and Emily Shuckburgh, a climate scientist with the British Antarctic Survey, the book “explains the history, dangers and challenges of global warming and explores possible solutions with which to reduce its impact,” according to an Amazon blurb.The volume, titled “Climate Change,” is part of a new Ladybird Expert series aimed at adults. Its cover features a scene inspired by the 2000 flooding of the British town of Uckfield — a disaster that, at the time, prompted Prince Charles to lament “mankind’s arrogant disregard of the delicate balance of nature.” Oxford University researchers later concluded that global warming had made the Uckfield floods between two and three times more likely to happen. “It shows climate change is acting here and now to load the dice towards more extreme weather,” said researcher Myles Allen, who led the Oxford study, in 2011. Prince Charles has long warned of the dangers of climate change. In 2014, he called it the greatest challenge facing mankind. “We are running out of time ― how many times have I found myself saying this over recent years?” he said in a video address screened during Climate Week in New York. “We simply have to win the battle against climate change to secure our future, and the future of our children and grandchildren. I fear there is not a moment to lose.”Also in 2014, the prince skewered climate change skeptics, referring to them as the “headless chicken brigade” during an awards ceremony for entrepreneurs in the sustainability industry. “As you may possibly have noticed from time to time, I have tended to make a habit of sticking my head above the parapet and generally getting it shot off for pointing out what has always been blindingly obvious to me,” the prince told the audience, referring to his climate activism. “Perhaps it has been too uncomfortable for those with vested interests to acknowledge, but we have spent the best part of the past century enthusiastically testing the world to utter destruction; not looking closely enough at the long-term impact our actions will have.”Penguin told The Guardian this week that its new Ladybird Expert series will offer “bite-sized understanding” of challenging topics, such as quantum mechanics and evolution. Each volume in the series is penned by leading experts in their respective fields, the publisher said. Prince Charles’ climate change book was “extensively peer reviewed by figures within the environmental community,” Penguin said. Several climate scientists, including David Warrilow, chairman of the climate science special interest group at the Royal Meteorological Society, scrutinized the manuscript before publication. In 2015, Ladybird launched its Books for Grown-ups line, a satirical series that covers such topics as hipsters, the zombie apocalypse, hangovers and the midlife crisis.The series has reportedly sold more than 3 million copies to date.

We do not seek to adopt a model already enjoyed by other countries. We do not seek to hold on to bits of membership as we leave.”The extracts did not set out explicit details of the future trading relationship she wants to have with the EU or what the 12 priorities would be, but media reported they would also include removing Britain from the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.Media reported May would be less explicit on her plans for the customs union, but that her emphasis on building new trade relationships would make clear Britain could be no longer a member in the way it is now.Sterling fell sharply on Monday ahead of the speech on the prospect of a move away from preferential EU single market access and a hardening stance towards an economic bloc that accounts for roughly half of Britain’s exports and imports.The EU would be likely to insist on freedom of movement for EU citizens in return for full access to the single market, while many of those who voted for Brexit did so precisely in order to be able to restrict immigration.May will say she wants Britain to be a “magnet for international talent,” and a “great, global trading nation” that reaches beyond Europe to build relationships with other countries around the world.She will also say that it is in Britain’s national interest for the EU to succeed.“We will continue to be reliable partners, willing allies and close friends. We want to buy your goods, sell you ours, trade with you as freely as possible, and work with one another to make sure we are all safer, more secure and more prosperous through continued friendship,” she will say.(Additional reporting by William James, Editing by Kevin Liffey and Marguerita Choy)"
