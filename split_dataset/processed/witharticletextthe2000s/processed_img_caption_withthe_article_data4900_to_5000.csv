0,POLITICS,Trump's Position On Medicare Drug Pricing Just Flipped Again. Unless It Didn't.,Jonathan Cohn,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-medicare-drug-prices_us_589a28a2e4b0c1284f28e4c4,"Honestly, it's anybody's guess what the president really wants on this issue.",2017-02-07,"Jonathan Cohn - Senior National Correspondent, HuffPost",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c34278a210000e109cb7fcb.png?ops=100_100,"President Donald Trump’s on-again-off-again promise to have the government negotiate drug prices directly with pharmaceutical companies is back on again.Maybe.During the presidential campaign, Trump said he wanted the federal government to use its bargaining leverage to extract lower prescription prices for Medicare beneficiaries ― in effect, doing for seniors what governments in other countries have long done for their citizens.In saying that, Trump seemed to break sharply with Republican lawmakers, who have traditionally opposed giving the U.S. government that power. He also seemed to pick a big fight with the pharmaceutical industry, which is among the most influential in American politics.But last week, after meeting with several drug company executives at the White House, Trump appeared to back away from his promise.“I’ll oppose anything that makes it harder for smaller, younger companies to take the risk of bringing their product to a vibrantly competitive market,” Trump said. “That includes price-fixing by the biggest dog in the market, Medicare, which is what’s happening.”Like so many other policy pronouncements from the Trump White House, those statements were sufficiently ambiguous to invite different, even conflicting interpretations of exactly what the president meant.Fast forward to Tuesday and the daily White House media briefing, when NPR’s Mara Liasson asked Press Secretary Sean Spicer to clarify, once and for all, what Trump’s actual position is. Here’s how the exchange went:Liasson: So is he for Medicare negotiating drug prices or not?From there, Spicer gave a slightly disjointed explanation of what he meant. Here it is:The president’s clear. The president’s clear. I mean, when you look at the cost of ― not to drug costs. The U.S. government has not done. I mean, you look at what other, frankly ― the easier way to look at this is what other countries have done, negotiating costs to keep those down.After that, Spicer talked about the burden that drug prices place on seniors and ended with a paean to Trump’s negotiating skills:His commitment is to make sure, is that he does what he can and rather successfully use his skills as a businessman to drive down.If Trump decided to take this idea of negotiating drug prices seriously, and if Congress signed on, there is the potential to deliver savings both to seniors and to taxpayers ― although the amount of savings would depend entirely on how much negotiating power the federal government actually had. (In other countries, governments can refuse to cover certain drugs altogether in their health care programs. That gives them the leverage to win big discounts.)But while polls suggest most Americans support government negotiation on drug prices, getting a proposal through Congress would be politically difficult. Even many Democrats would oppose the effort, simply because, like Republicans, they depend heavily on campaign contributions from the drug industry ― and live in fear of negative advertising that the pharma lobby could deploy against them.Of course, whether Trump really supports the notion of government negotiating prices is anybody’s guess. Notwithstanding Spicer’s very direct answer to Liasson’s very direct question, the end of Spicer’s response leaves open the possibility that Trump envisions a different kind of strategy on drug prices.Specifically, it’s possible the president imagines he will personally sit down with drug company executives, and badger or cajole them into knocking down the prices of their products ― in much the way Trump has promised to go after companies that threaten to move operations overseas.It’s also possible that the president and his advisers have not worked out a clear position on how to reduce the price of prescription drugs.In other words, Tuesday’s statement from Spicer could have no significance at all.How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

1,POLITICS,Donald Trump Invites Sheriffs Who Love Him And His Immigration Views To The White House,Dana Liebelson and Ryan J. Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-invites-sheriffs-who-love-him-and-his-immigration-views-to-white-house_us_5898f638e4b0c1284f27b86f,They plan to discuss Trump's executive orders and other issues.,2017-02-07,"Ryan J. Reilly - Senior Justice Reporter, HuffPost",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c1228202600005e0484ece5.jpeg?ops=100_100,"WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump has asked a group of nearly a dozen sheriffs — many of whom are vocal Trump supporters — to come to the White House Tuesday morning to discuss law enforcement issues, including his executive orders on immigration.The group is expected to include a Wyoming sheriff who suggested Muslim terrorists were coming over the U.S.-Mexico border, a Texas sheriff who admired Trump for “saying what the American people want to hear,” and a Minnesota sheriff who praised Trump for sparking a “patriot spring” that he compared to the Arab Spring, the pro-democracy uprisings in the Middle East. Also on the invite list is the sheriff of Orange County, a law enforcement agency that is currently the subject of a federal civil rights investigation over a tainted jailhouse informant program that has allegedly violated the rights of numerous defendants for decades.A spokesman for the National Sheriffs’ Association, or NSA, who provided the list of attendees to The Huffington post, said the meeting is expected to last around 45 minutes to an hour. It will partly focus on immigration, including Trump’s executive order punishing so-called sanctuary cities that refuse to cooperate with federal deportation efforts. The sheriffs also plan to talk about mental health of inmates in jails and a program that permits the federal government to transfer military supplies to local law enforcement, according to the NSA spokesman.The people invited to meet with Trump on Tuesday include a combination of leadership chosen by the NSA and specific people the White House requested, the NSA spokesman told HuffPost. A White House spokeswoman said they would release a list of attendees and a readout of the meeting after it concludes on Tuesday.One sheriff invited to the meeting, Laramie County Sheriff Danny Glick, warned that people he labelled “OTMs” — “other than Mexicans” — were making their way over the border. “Sheriff Glick said he knows law enforcement in the southwest border states have found evidence of OTMs, such as Islamic prayer rugs and Korans, while investigating immigrant camps,” the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reported last year. The fact-checking organization PolitiFact has labeled claims that Islamic prayer rugs were found along the border “pants on fire wrong.” Glick also criticized the NFL for allowing Beyoncé to perform at the Super Bowl last year, when members of the association watching the game at their 2016 winter meeting turned off her performance.And in December 2015 — days after Trump first publicly proposed banning Muslims from traveling to the U.S. — Rockwall County Sheriff Harold Eavenson from Texas responded by noting that “the only way we can have a meaningful immigration policy is for us to first secure our borders.” Another potential attendee is Sheriff Caroline “Bunny” Welsh, an early Trump supporter who served on the Trump campaign’s Pennsylvania women leadership team and said the “energy and the enthusiasm for Mr. Trump was something I have never seen before.”Trump is also slated to meet with at least one Democrat, Davidson County Sheriff Daron Hall from Tennessee, a reform-minded law enforcement official who has focused on lowering the jail population and is supportive of the decriminalization of marijuana possession. Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke, a prominent and controversial Trump supporter who had been discussed for a potential role in the administration, will not be in D.C. for the meeting, a spokeswoman told HuffPost.Sheriffs can play a key role in choosing which immigration policies to prioritize. They have leeway, for example, over the extent to which they cooperate with federal immigration authorities, which includes deciding whether to hold undocumented immigrants in jail for longer than their initial charges allow. Trump has vocally criticized localities that don’t agree with him on this issue. The National Sheriffs’ Association, which also has its winter meeting in D.C. this week, represents more than 3,000 elected sheriffs across the United States, and leans conservative. When an Obama administration task force recommended a “soft look” for officers policing protests in 2015, the former president of the association trotted out a vest with “a fuzzy boa attached to the straps of the vest and a red target on the back,” according to a report in the Daily Caller. After Trump’s election, the group praised him for his “strong support for law enforcement.”"

The medical groups attached summaries of more than three dozen studies that found no link between vaccines and neurological problems, and noted that immunization has eradicated several diseases in the U.S.Trump has repeatedly espoused the discredited theory that children can get autism from vaccines. He hosted Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a proponent of the autism theory, in January at Trump Tower in New York City. Kennedy said afterward that Trump had asked him to head a commission investigating vaccine safety. A Trump spokeswoman previously said no decision had been made about whether to create a commission. The White House press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. Public health groups have been wary of wading into the political fray on vaccines, reluctant to give the impression that there’s any legitimate debate among scientists over whether people should have their children immunized. The letter had been in the works since Trump’s vaccine doubts resurfaced last month, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.Several government bodies already vouch for the safety of vaccines, and nongovernment researchers have repeatedly probed the link between vaccines and autism since a 1998 paper first caused alarm. That paper has since been retracted."

It is to change the nominee who can garner the 60 votes. Because 60 votes means that it is almost definitionally a bipartisan, mainstream nominee.”McConnell has repeatedly declined to say what he will do if Democrats filibuster, although he has also vowed that Gorsuch will be confirmed.Eight Democrats could vote with the 52 Republicans to advance Gorsuch, but Schumer’s declaration suggests it’s unlikely. And if McConnell makes good on his pledge, it may well require the nuclear option to break a filibuster. "

In Rizzo’s message, he offered the seventh grader tickets to Chicago’s Wrigley field as well as passes to attend one of their batting practices once he’s healed. He included the hashtag “StayStrong.”Henry accidentally bumped into a student, sparking a physical altercation that put him in intensive care with a serious brain injury, according to a GoFundMe page set up by the boy’s family.The other student, who has not been identified because he is a minor, was taken into police custody, according to reports.The incident lasted “a matter of seconds,” Kenyon Woods Principal Lisa Olsem said in a statement obtained by the Daily Herald. “Initial reports indicated this incident was not related to bullying but please be assured that we are working with our entire KWMS team, our School Resource Officer, local police and the [Elgin Area School District U-46] administration to fully investigate this incident,” she said.In an update Monday to a public CaringBridge page, Henry’s mother, Karen DeWilde Sembdner, shared that her son had been moved to a regular pediatric room and was steadily improving.“He is still resting but we are having conversations and he’s eating. He’s asking to read all the cards that he has received and is very thankful for them!” the post reads.On Tuesday, DeWilde Sembdner posted to Facebook a photo of her son in the hospital.She’s previously defended sharing photos of Henry, whose comatose body is her Facebook profile picture, saying she wanted to show people that what happened to her son “could happen anywhere.”Rizzo has meanwhile been retweeting photos of Henry’s classmates wearing Cubs jerseys in the boy’s honor this week. This sentiment followed a candlelight vigil for Henry on Saturday."

Scott Walker’s summer plans should come as no surprise.Walker (R.-Wis.) and his wife, first lady Tonette Walker, are scheduled to headline “a distinctly Christian cruise experience” in August through Inspiration Cruises & Tours. The trip will voyage from Washington to Alaska and back, costing passengers between $1,298 and $3,368 depending on their room preference. The cruise is geared for entrepreneurs and business professionals looking for a faith-based networking opportunity, Walker said in a welcome letter on the Inspiration website.“I want to personally invite you to join me and other special guests on a once-in-a-lifetime cruise to Alaska,” Walker said in his letter. “Along the way, we’ll have countless moments for building new friendships and engaging in conversations about what we hold dear: faith, freedom and family values.”Inspiration Cruises is a Christian-run company that operates trips sponsored by specific ministries. Walker’s cruise will be sponsored by Lifeshape, a Christian non-profit co-founded by Trudy and John White. Trudy White, whose father founded Christian fast-food company Chick-fil-A Inc., will also be a special guest on the cruise.Also joining the fun will be gospel singer Wes Hampton and Jason and David Benham, a pair of conservative Christian brothers and entrepreneurs who lost their scheduled HGTV show in 2014 for delivering anti-gay remarks at a prayer rally (or, as the Inspiration website says, due to “their commitment to Biblical values.”)Larry Cox, CEO of Lifeshape, told Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on Monday that Walker and his wife would not have to pay for the trip since they were invited to attend as speakers. But he added that the company wouldn’t be paying the Walkers any additional remuneration. According to Wisconsin’s code of ethics, “No state public official may accept or retain any transportation, lodging, meals, food or beverage, or reimbursement therefor” if doing so would at all conflict with their duties as an elected official.A spokesperson for Walker did not immediately respond to The Huffington Post regarding the governor’s compensation from Inspiration Cruises.Tom Evenson, a spokesman for Walker, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that Walker has asked the state Ethics Commission to review the invitation to ensure that it complies with state law. Evenson said he expects the board to send their decision next month.Matt Rothschild, executive director for non-profit watch-dog group the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, said he believed Walker’s scheduled participation on the cruise would violate the separation of church and state.“He’s totally disregarding the wall between church and state, and he’s offending everyone in Wisconsin who doesn’t share his beliefs,” Rothschild told The Huffington Post. “He better be paying for this out of his own pocket. It certainly shouldn’t be put on the people’s credit card.”"
6,QUEER VOICES,Why The ‘Conservative’ Chinese New Year Parade Was Super Queer This Year,Jessica Prois,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-the-chinese-new-year-parade-was-super-queer-this-year_us_5898b7d0e4b0c1284f273a42,"Asian-Americans are calling on us all to be ""woke in the year of the rooster.""",2017-02-06,LGTBQ Asian-Americans march in the Lunar New Year parade to highlight the unique issues they face. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5898cb13280000f314997220.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"NEW YORK ― Against a backdrop of dragons and dancers parading down the streets of lower Manhattan Sunday, Lanny Li described how it took her conservative Asian mother over a year to accept her coming out as a lesbian. But now Li’s mom is fully supportive. She spent the weekend on the sidelines cheering as Li marched in Lunar New Year parades.Clara Yoon, another mother, took part in the Sunday Chinatown parade to support her Korean-American transgender son who came out six years ago.“I marched because I wanted to uplift the visibility of Asian parents who love their LGBTQ kids and to celebrate the different type of family in Asian immigrant community,” Yoon told HuffPost. Amid the annual parade ― a celebration that ushers in a new year in many countries with high Asian populations ― Li and Yoon were part of a large contingent of Asian-American LGBTQ community members who took a strong stance on issues including queer rights and immigration.“We don’t normally get political,” Stephanie Hsu, a volunteer coordinator for Q-Wave, an Asian-American LGBTQ advocacy group, told HuffPost. “And this parade isn’t usually political ― it’s more conservative. We actually got denied participation to the parade when we first applied in 2009. But we couldn’t stay silent this year because of things Trump has said.”The groups cited the GOP’s harsh anti-LGBTQ platform and Trump’s immigration orders as reasons for the Asian-American community speak out. There are currently more Asian-American undocumented immigrants than undocumented Mexicans living in the United States.Marchers carried signs that read “Woke in the year of the rooster” calling for more awareness on social issues among both the general public and within the Asian-American community itself.“It’s different for Asians,” Li said. “Parents are more conservative and patriarchal. It’s just not something Asian parents are used to. [Being LGBTQ] might not even be seen as an option.”Hsu said for Asians, the idea of being queer doesn’t always jive with longstanding cultural beliefs.“Asians sometimes associate being LGBTQ with simply putting sex out there in general. It might not even have anything to do with sexual orientation — but just the idea of talking about sex and putting sex on display,” Hsu told HuffPost.She also pointed out the fact that it’s even more difficult for undocumented Asians, who face a unique set of challenges when it comes to being open about sexuality.Also on HuffPost: “Many Asian immigrants come out when they get to America because it’s more welcoming. If they had to go back, they might not be able to continuing living as out,” Hsu explained.To be sure, traditional Asian culture can center around conformity, traditional gender roles and a duty to have children ― and the very notion of LGBTQ issues can simply be a non-starter for immigrant parents.But among second-generation Asians, that’s largely changing, advocates at the parade said. For instance, among all ethnic groups in America, Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) are the most supportive of same-sex marriage, with 64 percent of AAPIs supporting LGBTQ marriage equality. Q-Wave is one group that’s helping to educate the Asian-American community and family members of LGBTQ individuals. The nonprofit holds workshops around Asian-American identity, helps translate materials for families who don’t speak English, fundraises and more. Another group, API Rainbow Parents of PFLAG NYC, also focuses on awareness among family members. “My mom is talking with other parents of kids who are LGBTQ,” Li told HuffPost. “She is forming her own community, too.”"

Most braved the freezing prairie winter to walk into Canada.“We haven’t had something before like this,” said Maggie Yeboah, president of the Ghanaian Union of Manitoba, which has helped refugees get medical attention and housing. “We don’t know what to do.”A temporary restraining order by a U.S. judge of President Donald Trump’s executive order that blocked nationwide the implementation of key parts of the travel ban has provided a reprieve for refugees trying to come to the United States.But Canadian advocacy organizations are bracing for a greater influx of asylum-seekers, driven in part by the contrast between the ruling Liberal government’s acceptance of Syrian refugees in Canada with Trump’s anti-foreigner rhetoric.“They will make a dash for Canada, whether they are going to go through cold weather to die or not,” said Abdikheir Ahmed, a Somali immigrant in Manitoba’s capital Winnipeg who helps refugees make claims.Since late summer, 27 men from Ghana walked to Manitoba from the United States, Yeboah said. Two lost all their fingers to frostbite in December and nearly froze to death.More than 7,000 refugee applicants entered Canada in 2016 through land ports of entry from the United States, up 63 percent from the previous year, according to Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA).Over 2,000 more entered “irregularly” during a similar time period, without official authorization, such as across unmonitored fields.Four hundred and thirty asylum seekers crossed Manitoba’s border irregularly in the first nine months of 2016-17, up from 340 the entire previous year, CBSA said.“The U.S. presidential campaign, putting undocumented immigrants and refugees in the spotlight, terrified them,” said Ghezae Hagos, counselor at Welcome Place. “The election and inauguration of Mr. Trump appears to be the final reason for those who came mostly last month.”In Quebec, 1,280 refugee claimants irregularly entered between April 2016 and January 2017, triple the previous year’s total.In British Columbia and Yukon, 652 people entered Canada irregularly in 2016, more than double the previous year.More of these people would enter at border crossings, advocates say, if Canada didn’t have a policy of turning many of them away when they do. The 2004 Canada-U.S. Safe Third Country Agreement requires people to apply for asylum in the first of the two countries they arrive in. Advocates argue the agreement inadvertently encourages people to dangerously sneak into Canada and make a claim rather than be rebuffed at the border.If the government doesn’t abandon this agreement, they say, it could find itself in court.The number of refugee applicants crossing the land border under exceptions to the Safe Third Country Agreement has risen by 16 percent in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same time period the year before.In Buffalo, New York, hundreds of people are streaming through Vive, a shelter that helps refugee applicants to Canada.Vive’s client numbers, including long-time U.S. residents and refugees, spiked last summer and have stayed consistently high since – two or three times what they’d normally see a year or two ago. Vive’s Canadian service manager Mariah Walker expects to see even more.“Clients are definitely spooked by (Trump’s) executive orders,” said Walker.CANADIAN WELCOMEPrime Minister Trudeau took office in 2015 on a commitment to admit tens of thousands of Syrian refugees.“While the majority of the world is turning their backs and building walls, the fact that Trudeau took this bold humanitarian goal put [Canada] on the map,” said Chris Friesen, director of settlement services at Immigrant Services Society of British Columbia.But this year, Canada plans to take only 7,500 government-assisted refugees - less than half last year’s number. People eager to sponsor refugees find themselves waiting years to do so.Anisa Hussein, 20, and Lyaan Mohammed, 19, hired a smuggler to take them from Somalia to Minneapolis in August, where they planned to settle in a large Somali community. But Trump’s anti-refugee rhetoric frightened them into traveling to Manitoba days later.“(Trump) said he would turn away the refugees and we would go back to Somalia,” said Mohammed, peeking timidly from behind the hood of a thick parka she received in Canada for winter. “We were so scared. We just wanted to be [in] a safe place.”They rode a bus and taxi to North Dakota, then walked for hours into Emerson, Manitoba and filed refugee claims.They might have been able to cross at a port of entry if Canada’s policies were different, says Canadian Council for Refugees executive director Janet Dench.Her organization, as well as Amnesty International and the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, are demanding Canada abandon the Safe Third Country Agreement: Trump’s United States is no safe haven, they argue.The government is standing by the agreement, Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen told the House of Commons last week.If the government doesn’t act, Dench said, her group will sue.“We are talking about people’s charter rights. … So, yes, we would expect to see something in the courts.”(Additional writing by Andrea Hopkins; additional reporting by Nicole Mordant in Vancouver, editing by Edward Tobin)"

Before her plane landed at Washington Dulles International Airport, she received a call from Virginia’s Democratic attorney general, Mark Herring, who had sued the Trump administration on her behalf days earlier.“I’ll be there to welcome you,” Herring said on the call.Sure enough, he was at the airport to greet the 23-year-old college senior, a Libyan citizen who has been studying in the U.S. since 2014.“Najwa is a bright, accomplished young woman,” Herring told The Huffington Post on Sunday. “She did not deserve what happened to her.” Trump’s Jan. 27 executive order suspends refugee resettlement entirely for 120 days, bans Syrian refugees indefinitely, and bans all citizens from Libya, as well as Iran, Iraq, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, from entering the U.S. ― even if they hold valid visas.Elyazgi said Monday she was midair when Trump signed the executive order. Unable to board her connecting flight to Washington, she was forced to grapple with unplanned travel expenses in Istanbul and the worry that she would be unable to graduate. “I felt destroyed, honestly. I thought, ‘That was my future,’” she told HuffPost.Wracked with uncertainty, all she did was watch the news, apply to other schools and sleep. At one point, a hotel employee came to check on her after noticing her “Do Not Disturb” sign had been unchanged for four days. “It was a nightmare. I was not living in that week,” she said. Elyazgi has already overcome plenty of obstacles to get a college education. She graduated with the highest GPA in her high school, which earned her a full scholarship to the school of her choice. Elyazgi had enrolled in two different Libyan colleges, but they closed as the country’s civil war broke out. When she decided to enroll at George Mason, the only U.S. embassy in Libya had also closed, so she was forced to secure two visas: the first to travel to the U.K., where she could then process a student visa to the U.S.But now, as a result of her latest ordeal, Elyazgi is questioning if she even wants to stick with her plan of pursuing further studies in the U.S. after she graduates. “It was heartbreaking to hear her say she was planning on continuing her education in a master’s degree here, but after what happened to her, she’s planning on pursuing it in Canada or another country,” Herring said.“Even if we’re successful in getting that ban overturned, a lot of damage has been done that will be hard to overturn,” he added.The first several hours after Trump signed the Jan. 27 executive order were chaotic, Herring said, made worse by the fact that his office was getting “no information” about the details of the travel ban. Herring learned that students and faculty around Virginia had to cancel plans to present their work at conferences outside the country. “We’re trying to get our arms around how much damage was caused,” he said.At least 350 students and faculty members at Virginia Commonwealth University, Virginia Tech, George Mason University, William and Mary and the University of Virginia could be affected by the order, said Virginia’s solicitor general, Stuart Raphael, according to NBC Washington. The legality of Trump’s executive order is currently being battled out in federal court. If it’s upheld and Elyazgi decides to stay, she would have to choose between studying in the U.S. and not seeing her family for three years until she completes her advanced degree.The international studies major said she wanted to pursue an education in the U.S. because of its prestigious schools and because the U.S. is “one of the most democratic countries.” “They respect all religions. In the First Amendment, it says freedom of speech, freedom of religion, everything,” Elyazgi said. “I was expecting this [kind of ban] to come from Libya; I can’t believe that it’s coming from the United States.”Her feelings toward the American people have changed too, she said ― but for the better. She said even the Customs and Border Protections agent who stamped her papers on Saturday said, “Welcome back. We missed you.”“The people were there for me,” Elyazgi said.” I felt loved.”How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

After a tough start, the refugee from Latakia is becoming a culinary star in her adopted country and an example for other refugees.SAO PAULO, BRAZIL – “My name is Muna Darweesh. I am 36 years old. My country was being destroyed by a civil war, so I fled to Brazil and restarted my life. As a Muslim, I’ve always covered my hair, but I haven’t covered my mind.”These are the words with which Muna, a Syrian refugee turned Brazilian success story, introduced herself the first time she went on stage to tell her entrepreneurial story to an audience in São Paulo, Brazil’s commercial capital. That she spoke to them in Portuguese was a mark of how far she has come.In 2013, when life in her home city of Latakia was made unlivable by war, Brazil was one of the few escape options for those Syrians who could afford the cost of the journey. Although she knew next to nothing about the country, Brazil was letting Syrians enter on a holiday visa and then apply for refugee status.“I dreamed of a country that would receive my children. So we got our visas to Brazil,” said Muna.Since the civil war in Syria began, Brazil has taken in 2,300 Syrian refugees, according to Conare, the Brazilian National Committee for Refugees. The majority of them, like Muna and her family, have ended up in São Paulo, home to the country’s largest Arab community.As Muna and her husband, Wessam Jammal – a marine engineer – discovered, reaching safety was only the first step. They still had to make a life and find work in their adopted country.Syrian asylum seekers have the right to work as well as access education and public healthcare while their applications are considered. But outside of funds distributed through the Catholic charity, Caritas, there is no government system to receive asylum seekers and offer them longer-term support.Brazil’s long economic boom has turned to bust in recent years. At least 14 million of Brazil’s 210 million citizens live below the poverty line. While a number of charities and nonprofits from Caritas and Missão Paz, to Adus, a refugee integration group, offer help with language lessons and finding jobs, the emphasis is on the new arrivals to help themselves.With help from relatives, Muna and her family rented a house, but within a year their money had run out and they found themselves trading down. They moved from a relatively comfortable neighborhood to the cheaper central areas of São Paulo where some Arab and Muslim communities have traditionally congregated around a handful of mosques. The presence of many of the Arab residents can be traced back to an influx of textile traders in the late 19th century. The family were given a loan by one of the mosques to cover rent and found themselves in a run-down apartment.But housing was only part of the problem. With her degree in English literature, Muna thought she could be an English teacher, but quickly found that it was a lot of work for very little money. While her husband had been a well-paid engineer in Syria, the language barrier meant this was a nonstarter in Brazil.Then some inspiration struck at the mosque: “One day, I saw a woman selling bread at the mosque and I got the idea of working with food.”That is when Muna tried her first sentence in Portuguese: “I asked a woman of Arab descent, ‘Onde tem árabes?’ (Where are the Arabs?)”Muna’s catering business was launched with 1,500 reais ($470) in the little kitchen in her apartment, which she packed full of Arabic herbs and spices. Her first offering was halawet el jibn, sweet cheese rolls. The initial plan was that Muna would cook and her husband would do the hawking.“Then, one day, I saw a woman selling things on the streets, something I have never seen in Syria,” said Muna. “When I saw this different side of Brazilian culture, something occurred to me.”Determined to make a go of it, Muna took her four children and Wessam and went out to sell Arabic sweets on the street and in Arab-owned neighborhood stores. Sales were astonishing. While Wessam had sold 10 pieces that day, Muna sold around 50 desserts. “Now, I am famous there,” she said with a laugh.The family’s routine for the next year and a half was set. Apart from selling sweets at Arabic stores six days a week, Muna would sell desserts outside the Brazil Mosque on Fridays, while Wassem would do the same at Santo Amaro Mosque.Muna says that she often thinks about how different her life would have been at home, where there would have been no impetus or support for her to work. “I couldn’t show my talents in Syria, because of the social control, and my father and my brothers. Fortunately, I have an open-minded husband. I could not have done anything in Brazil if I had been with another man.”Her local reputation received a boost after she came to the attention of refugee support organizations Migraflix and Adus. They invited her to give talks and hold cooking workshops. She has since catered for organizations such as the U.N. Refugee Agency in Brazil and TEDx Sao Paulo, as well as embassies and large corporations. Her Facebook page ”Muna Sabores e Memórias Árabes” (Muna’s Arabic Tastes and Flavors) is often besieged with orders.Brazil’s television stations soon took note and an appearance followed on Brazilian Master Chef. Last December, she appeared on TV Globo, the nation’s top network, as part of the project, “My Refugee Friend,” through which refugee families spent their Christmas Eve with Brazilian families.At home, as well as doing all the cooking, Muna and her husband process the online orders and hone their language skills. “I learn Portuguese with my Brazilian customers through their food orders,” she said.Meanwhile, her four children have thrown themselves into their new lives, with three of them becoming citizens. Only her oldest daughter, Gawa, could not apply for citizenship because she was over five years of age when she entered Brazil.They are all in school, have made both Brazilian and Syrian friends, and speak fluent Portuguese. Still, the couple believes “it’s good for them to listen to their native language,” so they keep the TV on and tuned to an Arabic channel.Muna is unconcerned about how the Brazilian lifestyle might affect her children’s native culture. “I will let them choose what to do. I can give some guidance for their lives, but I cannot force them to do anything. My children are Brazilians now.”Future plans include the launch of a restaurant where Muna aims to combine Arabic gastronomy, music, dance, poetry and history. “I want to create a cultural experience for people,” she says.The pace and extent of the change she has experienced leaves her sometimes wondering whether she is living ”another woman’s life,” she says. “It never occurred to me that, one day, I would do what I have done here.”This article originally appeared on Refugees Deeply.

Mosques from a wide array of Islamic traditions and schools of thought participated. Leaders took questions from the public about Islamic law and teachings. There was a special emphasis on showcasing how British Muslims use mosque communities to organize social action projects, like blood drives, hospice visits, and food collections for the homeless.In the weeks leading up to Visit My Mosque day, several mosques also arranged interfaith exchanges with other faith communities in their neighborhoods ― attending church services and participating in peace walks.Jeremy Corbyn, leader of Britain’s Labour Party, visited a mosque in north London. He issued a challenge to President Donald Trump, whose recent executive order on refugees and immigrants has been criticized for unfairly targeting Muslims.Islamophobic rhetoric and attacks spiked in the UK after the Brexit vote in June 2016, according to Tell MAMA, a British organization that monitors anti-Muslim incidents.The Muslim Council of Britain’s Secretary General Harun Khan said that he was moved by all those came out to show solidarity with Muslims.“As the world recoils at President Trump’s so called ‘Muslim Ban’ and the mass killing at a mosque in Canada, [Visit My Mosque day] is a much needed antidote to the poisonous atmosphere we find ourselves in,” Khan told The Guardian. “The British public, Muslim and non-Muslim, have an opportunity to come together and renew bonds of friendship.”See images of this year’s Visit My Mosque day below."

It will rely on users to flag fake news on its network so that the articles can then by fact-checked by its partner organizations.Any news report deemed to be fake by two of its partners would then be tagged with an icon to show that the content is contested, Facebook said.Facebook is also supporting a separate initiative launched by Google dubbed “CrossCheck” which calls on users to submit links to contested content to a dedicated website so that it can be investigated.Seventeen French newsrooms have joined the project, including AFP and the French public national television broadcaster.Facebook is also taking steps against fake news in Germany, where government officials have expressed concerns that false stories and hate speech online could influence a federal election in September in which chancellor Angela Merkel will seek a fourth term in office.In the United States, Facebook has said users would in future find it easier to flag fake articles as a hoax, and added that it will work with organizations such as fact-checking website Snopes, ABCNews and the Associated Press to check the authenticity of stories.(Reporting by Gwenaelle Barzic and Sudip Kar-Gupta; Editing by Andrew Heavens and Richard Lough)"
12,POLITICS,Restaurant Shows Customers What's Wrong With Donald Trump's Anti-Immigrant Orders,Kate Abbey-Lambertz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kiwiana-receipt-immigrants-trump_us_5898c991e4b0406131384c5b,"“I see this as a peaceful protest,” says the Brooklyn restaurant's head chef.",2017-02-06,"Mark Simmons, a former ""Top Chef"" contestant, is taking a stand against Donald Trump's executive orders.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5898efdf2800001f00997320.jpeg?ops=crop_26_77_1974_1526%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"As President Donald Trump works to exclude refugees and immigrants from Muslim-majority countries from the United States, one New York City eatery is reminding its customers that immigrants are part of what makes America great. Kiwiana, a Brooklyn restaurant that serves fare from New Zealand, recently started including a note on its receipts that reads: “Immigrants make America great (they also cooked your food and served you today).”The message went viral after NBC News contributor Mary Emily O’Hara tweeted a photo of her receipt from a meal at the restaurant on Sunday. The note doesn’t explicitly mention the president, but Kiwiana head chef Mark Simmons decided to add it to receipts “when the outrageous executive orders started to rain down from Mr. Trump,” he told The Huffington Post in an email. Trump signed an executive order last month calling for stricter border security and a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, which he has repeatedly insisted Mexico will pay for. (Mexico’s president has continually objected to the proposed wall and said his country will not pay for it, despite Trump’s promises.) Another order Trump issued last month temporarily suspends the refugee resettlement program, bans Syrian refugees indefinitely, and bars nationals of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. The order fueled protests around the country as well as challenges in court. A federal judge put the travel ban on hold nationwide with a temporary restraining order on Friday.“I see this as a peaceful protest,” Simmons explained in his email. The response to his restaurant’s message has mostly been positive, he said, though one woman did call to criticize him for “reverse racism.” Trump spent his time on the campaign trail stoking his supporters’ fears about immigrants and refugees. He jumped into the race with a speech referring to Mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals, and he made the border wall a central part of his platform.“Beginning today, the United States of America gets back control of its borders,” Trump said on Jan. 25, when he signed the order to build the wall. “I just signed two executive orders that will save thousands of lives, millions of jobs and billions and billions of dollars.”Immigrants and children of immigrants make up the majority of Kiwiana’s staff and come from at least six different countries. Simmons, who grew up on a sheep farm in New Zealand, is an immigrant himself. He strongly rejected Trump’s negative depictions of immigrants in his email: I offer a service to the community and I pay taxes. I am hard working and love living in Brooklyn and providing a service to the community that is close to my heart. Immigrants are hard working, happy to be here and are honest and loyal people. There are no bad hombres at Kiwiana restaurant. Immigrants are the backbone of the hospitality industry. Without immigrants the industry would be crippled. Simmons was a contestant on the fourth season of Bravo reality show “Top Chef” in 2008. He opened Kiwiana in 2011. "

Fifteen minutes later, they were joined by Ebrahim Abdo Ali Al-Murisi and Tahani Ali Ahmed Al Zubairi, a couple traveling with their five children, ranging from 3 to 14 years old.The two families embarked on a nearly identical journey late last month. They traveled from Djibouti to Ethiopia, Ethiopia to Ireland, and then from Ireland to the U.S. on Friday Jan. 27. But last time they were on U.S. soil, they never made it out of customs. Hours after their flight took off, Trump signed an executive order temporarily banning individuals from Yemen, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Libya from entering the country. Shortly after, the State Department canceled the Azizs’ and Al-Murisis’ visas. When the Yemenis arrived at Dulles the morning of Jan. 28, authorities detained them, questioned them and forced them to sign paperwork without access to lawyers or interpreters, said Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, a lawyer from the Legal Aid Justice Center who is working on their case. Authorities at the airport marked their immigration visas with a stamp that read, “canceled DWAS, application withdrawn.” Sandoval-Moshenberg believes the travelers were coerced into signing documents to voluntarily cancel their visas.A couple hours later, the Aziz brothers and the Al-Murisis boarded a flight back to Addis Ababa — an unexpected expense tacked onto an already costly journey. They spent several days in the airport there before Ethiopian authorities told them they had exhausted their welcome, said Paul Hughes, a lawyer at Mayer Brown who is also working on their case. Then they continued on to Djibouti, where they waited for news from their lawyers.Back in Virginia, a team of lawyers from the Legal Aid Justice Center and Mayer Brown secured a temporary restraining order in federal court, giving their clients a short period of time to reenter the country. But they also had to get assurances that the U.S. government would facilitate their clients’ reentry to the country, despite the cancelation stamp on their visas. In the days ahead of the Yemenis’ second attempt to enter the U.S., their legal team worked the phones constantly to ensure that authorities in the several airports they would pass through knew to allow them to travel to the U.S.But as they waited for the Aziz brothers and the Al-Murisis again on Monday, their family members still couldn’t be certain their loved ones wouldn’t be turned away again. “I was looking at the door thinking, ‘Nobody’s going to come through that door,’” said Aqel, who had waited in vain for his sons to arrive in Detroit last week. Aqel, a U.S. citizen who has lived in Michigan since 2001, began the process of bringing his two sons to the U.S. as lawful permanent residents a year and a half ago. Late last year, immigration authorities invited Tareq and Ammar to be interviewed at the nearest U.S. embassy. The U.S. shuttered its embassy in Yemen in 2015 due to the escalating war there, so the brothers traveled to Djibouti for their Jan. 4 interview. Three weeks later, their passports were returned to them, stamped with immigration visas, meaning they were approved for lawful permanent residency. They boarded their flight the following day, unaware that the new U.S. president was preparing to block their entry. “They had the bad luck of taking off on Friday instead of Thursday,” Sandoval-Moshenberg said. “They took off thinking this was going to be the happiest day of their lives. When they landed, it turned into a nightmare they could have never ever expected,” he continued.The entire process of getting the Aziz brothers to the U.S., which including extensive security vetting of both men, cost over $70,000, their father estimated. “I owe so many people money to bring them here,” he said. But even as he reflected on his debt, Aqel couldn’t stop smiling at his sons. “I am so happy, I am so glad,” Aqel said. “This is America, America is for everybody.”The Aziz brothers plan to travel to Flint, Michigan, with their father, where they will continue their studies, they said. The Al-Murisi family will continue on to Richmond, California, where Ebrahim’s father lives.Ebrahim’s father has been trying to convince his son to move the family to the U.S. for the past fifteen years, said Gawhar Fadhle, Ebrahim’s step-brother, who met him at the Dulles airport. But Ebrahim, a dentist who worked at a clinic in Sanaa, didn’t want to leave his home. It wasn’t until the escalation of the war in Yemen, where the U.S. is backing Saudi Arabia in the conflict, that he agreed to move. Despite their unwelcoming introduction to America, the Azizs and Al-Murisis said they are grateful and relieved to have made it to the U.S. Tareq smiled as he gazed at the lawyers who fought to bring him and his brother to the U.S. “They made me feel like there is a family here,” he said.

In an effort to promote body positivity, Ben Yahr teamed up with photographer Matthew Dean Stewart to create a shot-by-shot redux of those now-iconic pregnancy shots ― and the results are pretty damn ***flawless. “I, along with the rest of the world, was so ecstatic and moved by Beyoncé’s pregnancy announcement and photos,” Yahr, who debuted the series in a Feb. 4 BuzzFeed article, told The Huffington Post. An outspoken “body positivity activist.” he added, “My goal with these photos was to channel Beyoncé and encourage everyone to embrace their bodies and feel sexy and strong and worthy of applause.”To say Ben slays in these photos is an understatement.

Bush administration’s use of torture during interrogations, says even he thinks President Donald Trump is going too far with his executive orders. In a New York Times op-ed titled “Executive Power Run Amok,” Yoo says while he supports a “robust vision” of the executive branch, he believes Trump fundamentally misunderstands the separation of powers laid out in the U.S. Constitution.“Even I have grave concerns about Mr. Trump’s uses of presidential power,” he writes.Yoo has long advocated for largely unchecked presidential power in times of crisis, such as the Bush administration’s war on terror. He wrote several legal opinions that were used to justify the CIA’s use of waterboarding and broad surveillance programs, and he even said presidential power protected the executive’s right to crush a child’s testicles if the president believed it would help him obtain information. He also defended former President Barack Obama’s use of armed drones. But in his op-ed, Yoo argues Trump lacks constitutional restraint. He specifically questions Trump’s executive orders calling for the construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and renegotiating NAFTA, and his firing of acting Attorney General Sally Yates after she said she wouldn’t defend his executive order on immigration.Yoo also criticizes Trump’s executive order banning travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, arguing the policy could have been constitutional if he had sought proper counsel on the matter.“Had Mr. Trump taken advantage of the resources of the executive branch as a whole, not just a few White House advisers, he would not have rushed out an ill-conceived policy made vulnerable to judicial challenge,” Yoo writes.“A successful president need not have a degree in constitutional law. But he should understand the Constitution’s grant of executive power,” he writes. “Otherwise, our new president will spend his days overreacting to the latest events, dissipating his political capital and haphazardly wasting the executive’s powers.” Yoo previously criticized Trump’s remarks on torture, telling Fox News last year he believes Trump doesn’t understand what waterboarding is used for.“I’m afraid Mr. Trump thinks of waterboarding, or worse, as a kind of punishment, like a sentence ― as you said, revenge or reprisals,” Yoo said. “That’s not what its purpose is. The purpose of it is not to take revenge for past acts. It’s to figure out what to do now to get intelligence to stop future attacks.”Yoo also took issue with Obama’s 2016 executive orders on gun safety, calling them an effort to “extend the reach of the regulatory state.” How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

The letter states that the NCAA has told the association that “due to their stance on HB2, all North Carolina bids will be pulled from the review process and removed from consideration.”Further, the letter warns, the NCAA could pull any postseason events scheduled for 2017-2018 from the state. (The NCAA’s original decision only affected the current academic year.) North Carolina cities and schools, the letter says, have submitted a total of 133 bids to host various NCAA sporting events between now and 2022.“North Carolina is on the brink of losing all NCAA Championship events for six consecutive years,” the letter states. “Our window to act is closing rapidly. ... Our last chance to save these events is now.”The letter was signed by Scott Dupree, the executive director of the Greater Raleigh Sports Alliance and a member of the North Carolina Sports Association.“I wrote the letter as a member of the North Carolina Sports Association, and with the approval of its board of directors, in order to provide our legislators in the General Assembly with the most up-to-date information in regard to the NCAA’s ongoing bid process, which is winding down,” Dupree said in an email statement. “I wanted to make sure our legislators were aware of the timeline and the potential economic losses for our state, and thus the urgency of the situation.”Gov. Roy Cooper’s (D) victory in November’s election seemed to signal the end of HB2, and the state legislature considered repealing it during a December special session. But a compromise between Democrats and Republicans fell apart, leaving the law on the books.NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has expressed a desire to bring the All-Star Game back to Charlotte, but the league has said it will not do so as long as HB2 remains law. The NCAA moved seven total events from North Carolina ― including men’s NCAA Tournament games and Division I championships for women’s soccer, women’s lacrosse and women’s golf ― in September. The ACC relocated its 2016 football championship from Charlotte to Orlando, Florida, and also moved the upcoming women’s basketball conference tournament out of the state.“The NCAA decided in September to remove championships from North Carolina for the 2016-17 season, and it has not yet determined future championship sites,” an NCAA spokesperson said in an email Monday, in response to questions about whether it had decided not to award events to North Carolina unless HB2 was repealed. “The NCAA expects to announce site selections for the 2018-19 through 2021-22 championship seasons in April.”The NCAA last year required cities interested in hosting future events to “specifically outline how they will protect participants and spectators from discrimination.”Duke men’s basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski has condemned the law as “embarrassing.” University of North Carolina head coach Roy Williams slammed the law on Sunday after UNC’s win in Greensboro, which was scheduled to host 2017 NCAA Tournament games this March before the NCAA moved them.“I’m glad we were able to take a game here because of that stupid rule that we have in our state that took a lot of great opportunities for people in our state, and great athletes that like to do things in our state,” Williams said Sunday. “I shouldn’t say rule, I guess it’s a law. A law’s more important than a rule, I guess. But I just think that’s ridiculous, and what it’s doing to our state and the reputation of our state.”This post has been updated with comment from the NCAA."

Since he became chairman of the committee in 2013, Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas) has pursued such an ideologically driven agenda, including what critics dubbed “witch hunts” meant to tarnish the credibility of scientists, that some now call it the “House (anti)science panel.” As a vocal skeptic of the widely accepted science behind manmade global warming, The Texas Tribune suggested Smith will be “invigorated by the new climate change-doubting presidential administration.”Those invited to testify seem likely to echo the chairman’s views.Jeffrey Holmstead, a partner at former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani’s law firm, Bracewell LLP, became a top lobbyist for coal and utility companies after he served as assistant EPA administrator under President George W. Bush. During his time there, the EPA weakened environmental rules and politically attacked scientists. The agency became “less independent than its predecessors and more closely tied to the White House’s ideology,” according to the educational nonprofit American Chemical Society.Holmstead has fought tighter EPA restrictions on mercury emissions from power plants, celebrating victory when the Supreme Court ruled in 2015 that the rules unfairly failed to consider compliance costs for businesses. The electricity industry remains the largest source of carbon pollution in the country, producing 30 percent of total emissions, due to its dependence on dirty-burning coal and methane-leaking natural gas. Kimberly White, senior director of chemical products at the American Chemistry Council, works for the country’s largest chemical manufacturing trade association, which in 2013 fought the EPA in the Supreme Court to block new rules limiting greenhouse gas emissions. That same year, the trade association sued California regulators to prevent the state from placing new restrictions on bisphenol A, or BPA, a potentially harmful chemical agent used to strengthen plastic bottles. The council wields tremendous lobbying influence, spending $86.4 million on those efforts from 2006 through 2016, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics.In eight pages of prewritten testimony for Tuesday’s hearing, White accused the EPA of using irrelevant or out-of-date data and procedures when drafting new regulations.Jason Johnston, a scholar at the Cato Institute ― which was founded by billionaire oil and chemical mogul Charles Koch ― last year equated President Barack Obama’s plan to reduce carbon pollution from utilities with “regulatory terrorism.” As far back as 2008, Johnston has railed against what he called “misguided regulation of greenhouse gas emissions” as a result of “climate change alarmism.” That’s a stance familiar to the fossil fuel industry. In one academic paper, he sought to poke holes in the scientific consensus on global warming by picking apart language used by researchers in what he called the “climate establishment.” The only would-be dissenter on a panel weighted heavily in favor of corporate polluters is Rush Holt Jr., chief executive of the nonprofit American Association for the Advancement of Science. Holt, a physicist, served as a Democratic congressman from New Jersey for 16 years.He said he plans to urge the committee not to put too much weight on the scientific opinions of polluters. He also wants to walk lawmakers through methods for identifying “the best science.”“It’s all too frequently that policies and regulations for some years now have been made with more emphasis on politically partisan ideology than on science,” Holt told The Huffington Post on Monday. “Science has usually not had a big place at the table, if any place at the table.”“I guess I’d say it’s about normal that they only have one serious scientist out of four witnesses,” he added, referring to himself. Smith, Holmstead and Johnston did not respond to requests for comment.But Ben Schreiber, senior political strategist at the environmental nonprofit Friends of the Earth, was not pleased by the hearing line-up.“This fits right into the Trump world of alternative facts,” Schreiber told HuffPost. “You no longer have to be a scientist to comment on science. It’s terrifying.”To the new Trump administration, a history of filing lawsuits against the EPA appears to be a sound qualification for shaping the agency. The president picked Scott Pruitt, the fossil fuel-backed Oklahoma attorney general who has sued the EPA 14 times, to lead the agency. Trump also named Myron Ebell, a hawkish climate science denier, to oversee the EPA transition team. A once-fringe political figure, Ebell last week said that Trump was taking steps to eliminate the EPA altogether. In fact, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) has drafted a bill that aims to “completely abolish” the agency by the end of 2018, HuffPost reported last week.At the very least, the news site Axios reported last month, the Trump team is considering major cuts to the EPA’s budget, including slashing hundreds of millions from grants to states and Native American tribes, climate programs, and environmental programs and management.This article has been updated to include White’s prepared statement.

In one academic paper, he sought to poke holes in the scientific consensus on global warming by picking apart language used by researchers in what he called the “climate establishment.” The only would-be dissenter on a panel weighted heavily in favor of corporate polluters is Rush Holt Jr., chief executive of the nonprofit American Association for the Advancement of Science. Holt, a physicist, served as a Democratic congressman from New Jersey for 16 years.He said he plans to urge the committee not to put too much weight on the scientific opinions of polluters. He also wants to walk lawmakers through methods for identifying “the best science.”“It’s all too frequently that policies and regulations for some years now have been made with more emphasis on politically partisan ideology than on science,” Holt told The Huffington Post on Monday. “Science has usually not had a big place at the table, if any place at the table.”“I guess I’d say it’s about normal that they only have one serious scientist out of four witnesses,” he added, referring to himself. Smith, Holmstead and Johnston did not respond to requests for comment.But Ben Schreiber, senior political strategist at the environmental nonprofit Friends of the Earth, was not pleased by the hearing line-up.“This fits right into the Trump world of alternative facts,” Schreiber told HuffPost. “You no longer have to be a scientist to comment on science. It’s terrifying.”To the new Trump administration, a history of filing lawsuits against the EPA appears to be a sound qualification for shaping the agency. The president picked Scott Pruitt, the fossil fuel-backed Oklahoma attorney general who has sued the EPA 14 times, to lead the agency. Trump also named Myron Ebell, a hawkish climate science denier, to oversee the EPA transition team. A once-fringe political figure, Ebell last week said that Trump was taking steps to eliminate the EPA altogether. In fact, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) has drafted a bill that aims to “completely abolish” the agency by the end of 2018, HuffPost reported last week.At the very least, the news site Axios reported last month, the Trump team is considering major cuts to the EPA’s budget, including slashing hundreds of millions from grants to states and Native American tribes, climate programs, and environmental programs and management.This article has been updated to include White’s prepared statement.

29,ARTS & CULTURE,Artist Captures Striking Portraits Of Refugee Children Trump Would Turn Away,Antonia Blumberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/artist-captures-striking-portraits-of-refugee-children_us_5893d34de4b0c1284f252ab2,Children make up more than half of the world’s refugee population.,2017-02-06,"Ashe, an eleven year old refugee from Somalia, now living in Lancaster with her family.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5893d4d72800001f00996942.jpeg?cache=xO6Uxt8GdC&ops=crop_23_535_2270_1820%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump has painted refugees as “bad dudes” with “bad intentions.” In reality, they are largely women, children and families fleeing desperate situations in their home countries.A new exhibit, titled “Refuge,” brings this juxtaposition to light by showcasing the refugee children who stand to lose the most from Trump’s policies.Visual artist Claire Salvo conceptualized the project last fall as a way to de-politicize the conversation around refugee resettlement. In particular, she wanted to highlight the fact that more than half of the world’s refugees are children, and many of them have only known life inside a refugee camp. “I wanted to remove the political aspect and just make it human,” Salvo told The Huffington Post. “There’s something about kids everyone can relate to. Everyone can agree it’s not a child’s choice ― it’s no one’s choice ― to be a refugee. They have no say in the matter.”Salvo worked with her local branch of Church World Service, a refugee aid organization, to locate families that would be interested in participating. In Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where the artist lives, it wasn’t hard.Lancaster is known for being “America’s refugee capital.” The city takes in roughly 20 times more refugees per capita than any other city in the U.S. In 2016, Church World Service Lancaster helped resettle more than 400 refugees, nearly half of whom were children under the age of 18.“These are the people that President Trump wants to close our doors to. They are some of the world’s most vulnerable people,” Stephanie Gromek, community resource coordinator for Church World Service Lancaster, told HuffPost. The organization connected Salvo with three families who expressed interest in participating, and the artist spent the last few months photographing, interviewing and sketching fifteen children from the families. Salvo shot the photographs on an iPhone and did the drawings with charcoal. She’ll be auctioning the pieces off starting in May, and a portion of the proceeds will be donated back to the participating families, the artist said.All three of the families arrived in the U.S. speaking only their native language and “with little more than clothes on their back,” said Gromek.One was a Muslim family from Somalia ― one of the banned countries included on Trump’s initial refugee order ― who just arrived in the U.S. in December. The other two families are related and living under one roof. They hail from Ethiopia and are members of the Anuak tribe, a persecuted ethnic minority.The process of resettlement is an arduous one. Refugees recommended for resettlement in the U.S. by the U.N. undergo a stringent, two-year long vetting process that includes various security and medical clearances as well as cultural orientation.Once they’re cleared for the journey, refugees have their tickets and travel booked through the International Organization for Migration on loan with no interest charged.“It’s their first line of credit once they get into the U.S., and they’re expected to pay that travel loan back,” Gromek said. “It’s a way for them to establish themselves with credit.”But Gromek added it can take years for refugees to pay back the loan, especially if they have a large family.“Refugees are some of the hardest working people I’ve ever met,” Salvo said. “Many are supporting families of upwards of ten people on minimum wage, but they’re just so grateful to be here.”During her interviews with the families, Salvo said she asked them: “What’s your greatest hope for life in America.” The language barrier made it difficult for her to get across the broader scope of the question, Salvo said. But one of the mothers, named Faduma, was able to communicate that what she wanted most was a washer and dryer.One day, Salvo was leaving her house when she saw that a neighbor had left a washer out on the curb. The photographer said she called a friend to help her lift the washer into her car, and she drove it down to the CWS office with a note that it was for Faduma.“The things many refugees want are so basic,” Salvo said, “and they’re things we take for granted, like not having to walk a mile to laundromat.”Refugee children have their own basic tasks to attend to once they arrive in the U.S., Gromek said. These include learning English, getting various immunizations and enrolling in school. Within a month, most refugee children have started their classes and are on their way to becoming everyday American kids.“Children are resilient in their own right, and refugee children are even more so I believe because they’ve been through so much,” Gromek told HuffPost. “They end up thriving.”"

But then I thought I could have more fun with it and do something else, so I thought of that.”Bouchard’s reactions as the Patriots came back and she realized she might possibly be going on a date with a stranger were immortalized on her Twitter page.First she got embarrassed.Then she freaked out.Then she became pragmatic.Then she became philosophical.Bouchard was still processing the loss on Monday morning.But Bouchard is a woman of honor and said she would stand by the bet she made with Goehrke.Goehrke is still waiting for Bouchard’s reps to contact him to set up a date. He’s also scoping out Chicago hot spots she might enjoy.“Honestly, if I’m even lucky enough for it to happen and I meet her, that would be good enough,” he told The Chicago Tribune. “Depending on where she wants to meet or what she wants to do, I’m going to try to take her to dinner. See what happens.”Whether it works out to be a love match for the tennis star remains to be seen. She has been linked to Jordan Caron, a hockey player in the Boston Bruins system, according to HockeyFeed.com."

Jack Turner and Col. Paul Shaffer victims of Mojahedin Khalq terror campaign </strong></p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5898bde125000026000b72d7.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"They say actions speak louder than words. Looking behind the Twitter storm which creates a smoke and mirrors effect to disguise the Trump administration’s true intents, one fact is blindingly clear; for this government, Iranians are first in the firing line.This, of itself, is not unexpected. On the campaign trail Trump threatened to tear up the nuclear deal with Iran. So it was already clear he’s no fan of Iranians.His first act as president has been to issue a direct and belligerent challenge to Iran – he included Iran in the Muslim ban and then declared that Iran is “on notice” after Iran test-fired a ballistic missile which it says is defensive. Iran is clearly in the crosshairs for Trump and his team.And the evidence stacks up. As a barometer for any individual or even government’s aggressive approach to Iran, support for the Mojahedin Khalq (MEK aka Rajavi cult) is as accurate an indicator as any. The group has advocated violent regime change against Iran for three decades. Its supporters are in doubt that this is a rallying cry for a U.S.-led war.Even before taking office, revelations about potential Trump administration advisers and officials giving support to the terrorist MEK cult caused concern among foreign policy experts. After all, anti-Iran pundits can choose from literally thousands of civil groups and personalities to act as advisors and partners in challenging Iran. The MEK’s dirty past includes the anti-Imperialist inspired murder of six Americans in pre-revolution Iran which it later celebrated in songs and publications. (The family of U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Jack Turner - “We were the first victims of terror before there was ever a war on terror” - is currently seeking redress for his death.) The new president has apparently brushed aside such concerns and has chosen to surround himself with people who have advocated for the MEK.By not denouncing the MEK Trump has done several things. One is to signal that he is at war not with Iran but with Iranians. The MEK is hated more profoundly than any of Iran’s current political leaders by Iranians inside and outside the country.He also signals that his war is not with ISIS but with the country Iran. Donald Trump rose to victory in part on the promise to take on ISIS and defeat the group. Yet ISIS cannot be defeated except by a coalition of forces that includes Iran. The facts on the ground in Syria and Iraq demonstrate unequivocally that ISIS forces in Aleppo and Mosul have been defeated largely due to the involvement of Iran. Trump clearly has no intention of defeating terrorism.But most importantly, this tolerance, even warmth, shown toward the MEK in American foreign policy circles is a message that can be read from afar and by everyone else in the world: the American war box is virtually empty. Aside from a handful of puny sanctions, bringing the MEK into the equation means that not only does the America not have a stick to wave at Iran, it appears foolish enough, befuddled by ideological zeal perhaps, to tie its fate to the most unlucky and doom-laden group there ever was.Laughably, parasitically, the MEK has consistently tied its fate to whichever it assumed was the winning side. However, the choice of MEK sponsors no longer looks so astute. Ayatollah Khomeini quickly saw through the MEK’s smarmy overtures to share power and promptly exiled them from Iran. The next step was to ally with Saddam Hussein against Iran during the Iran-Iraq war – a feat of spectacular treachery for which no Iranian will ever forgive them. After Saddam’s fall the MEK believed that the chaos in Iraq which gave rise to the insurrection of Al Qaida in Iraq would somehow carry them forward. The MEK even flirted with support for ISIS and the Syrian Free Army hoping they would find a home in the new Caliphate. Instead, the MEK were evicted from their base and sent into deeper exile in Albania, a country with no axe to grind against Iran. Long term sponsors have included Israel – which tasked MEK operatives with the assassination of Iranian nuclear scientists – and the anti-Shia Saudi Arabia. Both countries are bogged down with interminable troubles of their own. And now the MEK are hoping to cosy up with the Trump administration.The Obama administration kept the MEK at arms’ length and never entertained direct support for the group. When the government of Iraq held the US, along with the UN, responsible for removing the MEK from Iraq to a third country, the then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was forced to agree to remove the MEK from the US terrorism list before any third country would legally be able to accept them on their territory.Since 2001 Trump’s predecessors have built up strong homeland defences and led counter-terrorism efforts particularly against the threat of ISIS to the US and Europe. It is now likely that this legacy will be squandered by an administration with an overriding hatred of Iran. Instead of understanding the benefit of developing strategic partnerships with countries like Iran and Iraq in the global fight against terrorism, the Trump administration would rather rain down terror on the Iranian people.But the biggest delusion would be to believe that the MEK could be a reliable or effective partner in any sense. If Donald Trump has any insight into his own modus operandi - the erratic demands and refusal to take criticism – he will have a direct view of how the MEK operates. Aligning America’s foreign policy with the whims of a mind control cult will not secure victory over Iran. Instead, it will diminish America’s standing in the world, and it will certainly not make the world a better or safer place."
32,POLITICS,The Surprising Political Spending By Sponsors Of Some Super Bowl Ads,"OpenSecrets Blog, ContributorPublished by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics an...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/surprising-political-spending-by-sponsors-of-some-super_us_5898e9d9e4b061551b3e01ae,"Whether intentionally or not, Super Bowl LI commercials tackled some tough political issues.",2017-02-06,<p> 84 Lumber’s Super Bowl ad about a mother and daughter trying to cross the border made waves. </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5898e9f728000022009972e0.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"by Emily DalgoSuper Bowl LI left a few lasting impressions: That one-for-the-history-books come-from-behind victory by the New England Patriots; the Lady Gaga halftime show that was rich with hits and practically politics-free; and the ads, always the ads — many of which were not so politics-free.Just over two weeks into Donald Trump‘s presidency, companies had to make the risky decision whether to enter the fray and weigh in on controversial issues. Even the less freighted ads became contentious, though: Avocados From Mexico’s lighthearted spot, for example, was linked to the notion of paying for a southern border wall with a 20 percent import tax on Mexican goods (an idea that was floated, and then not floated, by the Trump administration).Other companies knew they would be making waves. 84 Lumber, a building materials supply company headquartered in Eighty Four, PA, had the most direct message. Its 90-second ad, aired for an estimated $15 million just before halftime, featured a Spanish-speaking mother and daughter’s long, difficult journey to the U.S. The commercial ends with the pair still in transit and directs viewers to “see the conclusion at journey84.com.” In the extended cut, the tearful mother and daughter arrive at a giant wall blocking them from crossing the border, but soon notice a door built of lumber that allows them passage. The final message: “The will to succeed is always welcome here.”Fox rejected the full ad, an obvious dig at Trump’s wall, after deeming it too controversial for TV. In response, 84 Lumber made a 5:45 version of the spot available during halftime on its website, which crashed almost immediately due to the flood of traffic. 84 Lumber has said it hopes the ad will help the company reach a broader audience.What may be surprising, though, is that 84 Lumber is anything but a bastion of liberalism.Individuals affiliated with the company made close to $60,000 in political contributions in the 2016 cycle; with the exception of $25, all the money that was given to candidates and party committees went to Republicans. Most was given by company founder Joseph Hardy III, including $33,400 that he gave to the National Republican Congressional Committee. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) received $5,400 from Hardy, while Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), Rep. Tim Murphy (R-Penn.), and Ryan’s leadership PAC Prosperity Action each received $5,000 from Murphy.Hardy’s daughter, Maggie Hardy Magerko, who is CEO of the company, told the New York Times she voted for Trump. She said she was “flabbergasted” that Fox rejected the original 84 Lumber ad.According to The New York Times, a 30-second slot during Super Bowl LI cost brands an average of $5 million, up from last year’s $4.8 million. That’s about $166,666 per second. Then there was the money the sponsors spent advertising their ads. Still, for most companies, spending big bucks on game-day commercials pays off, since the Super Bowl is the most watched event on TV every year.In another example of what might be seen as dissonance between an ad and the political profile of its sponsor, Anheuser-Busch took flak for its commercial that chronicled the journey of its immigrant founder Adolphus Busch, who came to the United States from Germany in the 1800s. Trump supporters started tweeting #boycottbudwiser (with far fewer correctly-spelled #boycottbudweiser tweets), which was trending Monday on Twitter, in response. The company has denied that the ad was in any way a comment on Trump’s travel ban, saying it was instead supposed to highlight its founder’s pursuit of the American dream.The $204.6 billion beermaker has strong financial ties to the Republican party: 55 percent of the nearly $2 million the company’s PAC and employees gave to federal candidates and party committees favored the GOP. The NRCC received $301,000, the Republican National Committee gained just over $221,900 and the National Republican Senatorial Committee took in $197,000. Airbnb, one of the most vocal companies in opposition to Trump’s travel ban, also anted up for a Super Bowl spot, taking a clear stand on immigration. The 30-second commercial aired before the second quarter, declaring “the world is more beautiful the more you accept.” No surprise here: Days after Trump’s executive order banning immigrants from seven predominantly-Muslim nations, the company began providing free and subsidized temporary housing for those affected by the new restrictions. Airbnb’s political spending seems to reinforce its stance. In 2016, almost every penny of the more than $450,000 it gave to candidates and political parties at the federal level went to Democrats. The Democratic National Committee came in as the top recipient with $69,500 and the party’s presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, gained almost $52,700.Whether intentionally or not, Super Bowl LI commercials tackled some tough political issues, and raised the prospect of increased opposition to Trump’s immigration policies on the corporate front going forward."

But on Friday, let’s break out the apple pie toast.This is not my original idea, if it was, I’d be a millionaire by now and could buy wine on flights instead of drinking my seat partner’s while they sleep. It’s from the mind of pastry chef Daniel Alvarez at Daily Provisions, which just opened this week right next to the ~new~ Union Square Cafe, aka Danny Meyerland. So thanks, Daniel, for all the work you do (work includes: these super-sized English muffins they serve, a ton of crullers, and an everything croissant because you can have everything).Get to the toast, lady.Okay!Per Alvarez, this is ridiculously easy. Peel and slice up 6 apples: 3 Granny Smiths, 3 Honeycrisps. Toss them with ½ cup sugar, 1 Tbsp. cornstarch, ½ tsp. ground cinnamon, and a generous pinch of kosher salt in a Pyrex. Into the oven they go (350°, what else?) until they look soft and jammy, like apple pie filling, 20–30 minutes.Then take a slice of really good bread (or oatmeal!), remember it’s Friday, and spread a thick layer of really good salted butter on it. Apple preserves go on top, where you’ll be floating for the rest of the day.This recipe has not been tested by the Bon Appétit Test Kitchen.Then make banana bread oatmeal: More from Bon Appetit: When Life Hands You Lemons, Make These Lemon Desserts No-Cook Pasta Sauces You Should Have Up Your Sleeve at All Times 35 Make-Ahead Breakfasts so You Can Sleep in and Eat Well All Week Our 50 Favorite Weeknight Dinners 24 Recipes Everyone Should Know How to Cook 75 Fast & Easy Weeknight Dinner Ideas"

A slew of trade deals followed for nuclear exports between India and some member-states, including the U.S., the UK and Australia.As the U.S. drifts from its pre-existing foreign policy stance, however, its role as a ‘moderator’ between India and the NSG is shadowed with inflating uncertainty. The American world view under the new president, Donald Trump, may undergo unforeseeable shifts, including vis-a-vis U.S. ties with China and Pakistan. And any change in Sino-US dynamics which renders China more susceptible to threats—in physical or institutional terms—will have repercussions for India’s NSG game-plan.In just the first week after his inauguration, Trump’s executive orders reflected his leit motif of engaging China from strength and recalibrating—or at least revisiting—U.S. strategic flanks on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the simmering situation in Tibet and China’s claim over Taiwan. Against such an uncertain backdrop, the extent to which the US will readily sponsor India’s NSG agenda has to be thoroughly reconsidered. The diplomatic trade-offs which the US secured with reluctant partners—such as China, New Zealand and Ireland—for India’s eventual NSG entree were tenuous. Orchestrated by the previous Republican administration of George W Bush, the proposal had secured support from France, Russia and the UK. The aim was to achieve a concession from the NSG on the mandatory criteria of the non-proliferation treaty (NPT), with full-scope safeguards as a condition of export. It took repeated redrafts by the U.S. for the India-specific waiver to be accepted.With the rejection of the first draft, the U.S. circulated an amended version which, though it imposed strict conditions on India’s entry into the elite club, readily dismissed the option of ‘immediate termination’ of the waiver should India avow nuclear-weapons testing. After two successive failures, the U.S. presented a final draft geared to addressing the concerns of reluctant NSG members. In this the focus shifted to the ‘energy needs of India, integrity of the non-proliferation regime, safeguards, and export controls’ as the objective of the waiver. The final draft still proffered the desired ‘clean and unconditional’ waiver which placed no, or minimal, compulsions, on India.As can be surmised from the relentless U.S. efforts, India’s NSG waiver was crucial to its strategic and status interests. A pro-waiver diplomat was spotted conceding that ‘the process was an incredibly complicated political and technological negotiation’. Wikileaks also revealed that it was ‘intense U.S. pressure which involved oversight phone calls to presidents and prime ministers of holdout countries’ that such a waiver outsmarted potential rebelling voices. U.S. officials were quoted as saying that the then secretary of state, Condoleeza Rice, made at least two dozen calls to numerous allies to ease the path for the India-specific waiver.As the U.S. barreled against sturdy opposition, most remarkable was China’s. At the outset, China plotted to coalesce dissenting voices—the smaller European nations among others. But overwhelming U.S. persuasion soon meant Chinese maneuvering ran aground. The ultimate stratagem then for China—still today its plausible alternative—was a criteria-based membership. This was promulgated in strong support of China’s all-weather friend Pakistan.The U.S. went out of its way, however, to exercise intense persuasion on China, including personal calls from Bush to Hu Jintao, the then Chinese president. Surprisingly, China decided to allow the waiver to pass in absentia. With Barack Obama now in the White House, the US circulated a proposal for India’s NSG membership, ‘Food for Thought’. Yet residual opposition from China meant India’s NSG accession was not concluded.Against such an historical trajectory, Indian expectations of eventual full membership of the NSG, facilitated by the US, might be high. But amid the current geopolitical churning, Trump’s China policy will have spillovers on the extent to which the US anchors India’s NSG journey. While Sino-U.S. ties have confronted tougher times, even as Obama openly challenged China’s aggressive stance over the South China sea or the TPP, Trump’s fired-up strokes might unsettle any Indo-US rapport at the NSG.The new administration has decided to dig up longstanding issues on Taiwan and Tibet, on which China has been irritable and uncompromising. Trump’s call on the Taiwanese president, Tsai Ing-wen, juxtaposed with a question-mark against the ‘one-China’ policy under which Beijing lays claim to the island, and his subsequent declaration of US withdrawal from the TPP brings contrasting signals to the table. If the former signified U.S. intervention on the Taiwanese-nationalist side, the latter would open up space for greater Chinese involvement in the regional economic arena.In relation to Trump’s U.S., India might, some suggest, feel morally obliged to take sides which resonate with its ‘identity’ in the international realm—its insistence on humanitarian policies for, and non-violent approach to, international conflict resolution. Christened as a ‘natural partner’ of the U.S., India has to give due regard to its stances but,India also has to exercise caution in the region and the wider hemisphere.A U.S. adamant on locking horns with China could incite tremors in the NSG problematic for India. It becomes highly unlikely, then, that the U.S. would go the extra mile to secure NSG membership. Further, a scuffle with China could bring the U.S. to confront a precarious and more volatile Pakistan. And this would signal trouble for a resilient India in its backyard. Hence, it serves well for India to build upon moderate policy options towards China and the U.S.A persistent irritant is the threat perception in Sino-Indian partnership, relating moreover to status concerns in the regional biosphere. Having invested enormous resources on major security issues with China, India has entered a status dilemma with Beijing. As Wohlforth suggests, status (as opposed to security) dilemmas are prevalent where systemic factors provide maximum opportunity for strategic uncertainty and misperception. Status, as conceived here, is formed by socially constructed identities and values in the domestic as well as the international realm.While India perceives China as a threat to its sovereignty and territorial integrity, China’s threat perception of India is in relation to its growing proximity to the US and its regional standing. As Basrur reckons, India is seen as a ‘reluctant hegemon’ by China, while India’s perception of China has changed over time, from a regional hegemon to a ‘strong competitor’. The need of the hour for India is to formulate better stances which allow the Sino-Indian status dilemma to subside—whereas if India were further to approach the US viewpoint it could be exacerbated.This stems not just from a defensive standpoint, but with a view to associating with Chinese policies whenever the potential arises. And amid China’s ebbing economic condition Indian markets can bring an opportunity: with its infrastructure deficit, India can provide the shoulder Chinese traders can rest upon. As rightly noted in the international relations domain, a state cannot choose its neighbours but it can decide its friends.In this geopolitical climate India has a pivotal role to play in the region, requiring steady advancement towards China on mutually beneficial grounds. For India to pursue its NSG agenda, China’s reluctance needs to be adequately addressed , while at the same time ensuring the US is equally motivated to go the distance.The author expresses deep gratitude to Mr Robin Wilson for his guidance and advice.

Tom McClintock’s town hall meeting in Roseville, California, to pressure him not to repeal Obamacare. A man at the meeting received a standing ovation after saying that his wife would die if Obamacare were repealed, because he cannot afford her medication, KQED public radio’s Katie Orr reported on Twitter.McClintock, who won re-election in 2016 by more than 25 percentage points, left the event under police escort as at least 100 demonstrators jeered him.Tea party conservatives opposed to Obamacare’s enactment packed constituent town halls in the summer of 2009 to lobby lawmakers against the reform law. The activism was credited with making support for the law politically radioactive and helping Republicans take back the House in the 2010 election.Now, progressive supporters of the law appear to be mimicking the tea party tactic in attempts to stall the repeal process.MSNBC’s Steve Benen has a thorough rundown of confrontations that have taken place and the steps that some Republican House members have taken to avoid them.Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas) unsuccessfully tried to keep information about an Obamacare constituent meeting private in January, and Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.) simply decided not to show up at two meetings she scheduled last weekend.The district staff of Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.) re-scheduled a constituent meeting about Obamacare on Wednesday after it became clear one of the constituents had invited a local reporter. Roskam’s office told HuffPost it does not permit reporters to be present at constituent meetings as a matter of policy.Other members of Congress have had trouble escaping contentious encounters. Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) had to contend with multiple interruptions at a mid-January town hall full of Obamacare supporters angry at his responses to questions about repeal. And Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.) told several conservative organizations last weekend he was “getting hammered” at town halls by women opposed to repeal, who he claimed were paid activists. Faced with some 150 angry constituents, Rep. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.) adopted a strategy similar to McClintock’s at a meeting in the Denver suburb of Aurora in mid-January. He limited entry to a small number of people and then sneaked out of the building early with a police escort.An earlier version of this story cited a protester’s claim that McClintock was not allowing people into the theater despite the fact that there was extra space. Doubts have since surfaced about this claim, so it has been removed."

Now that he finds himself in the same shoes, however, Trump is seemingly no longer troubled by a commander in chief who takes a load off once in awhile.After an intense first two weeks in office in which he signed 18 executive orders and memos, a dizzying pace that topped his most recent predecessors, the president flew to his private club in Florida to attend several private events, including a charity ball. In between meetings and phone calls with the leaders of Italy and Ukraine, he took some time for R&R.At least we think so.The White House refused to give details about the president’s activities at his Trump International Golf Club in Palm Beach, where he spent roughly eight hours on Saturday and Sunday. Nor did it provide the names of the president’s golf partners ― as the Obama White House routinely did.“At this hour, pool still does not have the names of POTUS’ golf partners (if he played golf) or the details of his activities at the golf club,” The New York Times’ Mark Landler said in a pool report on Saturday. “WH official tells the pool that they do not have information on POTUS’golf partners,” he added.Trump returned to the golf club early Sunday. A White House spokesperson reportedly said that in addition to some meetings, the president “may play a few holes of golf.”New York Times reporter Glenn Thrush offered a theory as to why the White House was being so coy about the outing: It included former House Speaker John Boehner.Since Trump repeatedly slammed Obama for his golf habits and promised that he would never stop working for the American people as president, it makes sense the White House would be reluctant to share that he’s gone back on his word.“I would rarely leave the White House because there’s so much work to be done,” Trump said in 2015. “I would not be a president who took vacations. I would not be a president that takes time off.”Trump added he would make time for golf but that he would “always play with leaders of countries and people that can help us.”During a campaign rally in 2015, Trump blasted Obama for playing more golf than Tiger Woods. “I love golf, I think it’s one of the greats, but I don’t have time,” he said.In 2014, he attacked Obama for spending taxpayer money on travel that included rounds of golf.

Knowing of the anti-Islamic sentiments associated with the Trump campaign, I had written to one of my former UC Berkeley students, Hamideh, and her husband, Amin, expressing concern for their safety and well-being. Amin responded, “We are deeply concerned for the safety of Muslims especially in regions dominated by Trump supporters, and are hearing anecdotes of the difficult choices some Muslims are having to make (such as whether it is safe for women to wear the hajib).” Hamideh wrote, “I fear for our future … I agree with you Professor that there is a lot to be done and I would like to kindly ask you: If you have a chance to talk to Trump supporters, please convey our concerns as Muslim Americans!”A core principle of all three of the Abrahamic religions—Judaism, Christianity and Islam—is hospitality. In Israel, it was considered a grave transgression to deny safety and comfort to the stranger at one’s gate. As we read in Leviticus, “If your brother becomes poor and cannot maintain himself with you, you shall support him as though he were a stranger and a sojourner, and he shall live with you. . . . fear your God, that your brother may live beside you.”Essentially, this is the Golden Rule, for God reminds Israel, “For you were once strangers in the land of Egypt.” How one treats strangers is also central to Christianity. In one of his most powerful parables, Jesus makes this ethic personal, telling his followers that if they fail to take a stranger in, to feed him, give him water, bind up his wounds or visit him in prison, it is the same as if they refused such succor and hospitality to him: “Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.” By extension, Jesus is saying to President Trump and those who support his anti-Muslim decrees, “If you do not open your doors and hearts to my Muslim brothers and sisters, if you do not provide a safe place for them, if you do not feed and clothe them, if you do not visit them in detention centers, it is the same as if you refused such blessings to me.” Gerard Manly Hopkins puts this ethic into poetic language: “For Christ plays in ten thousand places, . . ./through the features of men’s [and women’s] faces.” Some of those faces are the faces of Muslims, including refugees fleeing to our shores from Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Iran and other Muslim countries.Like Jews and Christians, Muslims consider offering hospitality to strangers as a core religious principle, one that the Prophet Mohammed taught and exemplified. As we read in the Qur’an, “They feed with food the needy wretch, the orphan, and the prisoner, for love of Him [Allah], saying, ‘We wish for no reward nor thanks from you.’”What a stark contrast between these sentiments and those coming from the Trump administration! In addition to Trump, whose inflammatory words are feeding a growing American Islamophobia, are sentiments of some of his closest advisors, including Lt. General Michael T. Flynn, Trump’s National Security Advisor, and Stephen Bannon, newly appointed to the National Security Council. Flynn asserted that “Islam is not necessarily a religion” and that “Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL.” Bannon and a number of his associates from Breitbart News have been spreading conspiracy theories about Muslim plans to supplant U.S. Constitutional law with Sharia law (which would be quite an accomplishment for a religion that currently represents one percent of the populace).Even before Mr. Trump stood astride the Republican Party, there was an increase in anti-Islamic sentiment in the United States. As reported by Gallup, “Islamophobia existed in premise before the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, but it increased in frequency and notoriety during the past decade.” According to the poll, more than half of Americans (52 percent) “do not respect Muslims.” Such attitudes explain the upsurge in Islamophobia, including, according to an FBI report, a 67 percent increase in anti-Muslim hate crimes between 2014 and 2015. The recent rampage and killing of Muslims at a Canadian mosque is only one of a number of hate crimes sweeping the West.I thought of Abraham, Jesus and Mohammed when I saw Muslims stranded in airports, unwelcomed to our teaming shores. But I also thought of the Golden Rule that animates the love for others by Jews, Christians and Muslims when I saw tens of thousands of American citizens streaming to the streets and airports to defend the rights of these children of God, not as aliens but as fellow human beings welcomed to sit at our hearths, to share our bread and to enjoy the blessings promised to all strangers at our door.e, “s”���n"

A utopian sci-fi fan, I believed in the promise of technology. At age 13, I fell in love with the Internet and knew the future had arrived. I discovered chat rooms and spent hours connecting with people across the globe, learning about their lives. The age of technology was here, and I was excited. At age 16, I found Napster and discovered whole new communities of folks sharing files and building online friendships. I downloaded as many albums and music files as I could, exploring the world with new energy – until the day I got a letter from the government demanding that I cease and desist or face criminal liability. The idea of government surveillance was not new to me, but that I could face criminal charges for connecting with others online was. Growing up as a politically conscious Black person in the U.S., I’d heard about the FBI’s counterintelligence program and how it was used to hunt and spy on Black activists. I grew up in Black neighborhoods where the trees were cut down so police helicopters could more easily find people. My entire childhood in Oakland, CA, was spent watching police cars creep along side streets, not looking for anything in particular. Instead, like the overseers who preceded them, these black and white vehicles were there to ensure that people like me remained in our place.In the 21st century, the overseer has jumped from outside on the street to online in your home. Without technology leaders and strategists dedicated to racial justice, Black communities – both citizen and migrant – will continue to bear the brunt of discriminatory policing, now in the high-tech world of the Internet.Devices and data are not neutral, because people are not neutral.It has often been asserted that technology is neutral. But we’ve now seen algorithms currently being used to drive predictive policing technologies based on historical crime data – data that are generated based on systemic policing practices that have disadvantaged Black people and other people of color for generations. Just as policing practices have been deadly for Black communities, this new and flawed technology, based in the biased practices of police, is no doubt lethal for Black folks as well. Additionally, police technologies like predictive policing have exacerbated fear in crime-ridden neighborhoods, rather than bringing a sense of safety. Slowly replacing the loud chopping sound of helicopters, silent remote controlled drones sneak up on their targets and clandestinely monitor people in their homes. Body-worn and dashboard police cameras watch us. Stingray technologies listen in. And license plate readers track us wherever we go. Black people and communities of color are more watched than we are helped. We can feel it. And like it has always been for us, being watched so closely creates anxiety, not comfort. And the anxiety that we are being targeted is real in us, because we have also always been real targets.Technology, like guns, in the hands of those who would use technology to kill is deadly. And, as with gun regulation, we need rules that keep vulnerable communities safe from the overreach of already troubled and racially biased law enforcement agencies.We must become the digital activists and data warriors we’ve been waiting for.There has been a lot written about how activists and organizers use social media to combat police violence. – from adapting to the technology of one’s time, to making use of social media in social justice work, to large-scale global social media uprisings. There have also been countless thought pieces about the use of Black Twitter and about the lack of diversity in tech companies.But I’m more interested in whether the digital age and the era of big data can advance our vision for justice, freedom and equity – or will the technology of the 21st century be used to crush this dream? I’m calling technologists in to commit to strengthening and advancing the Movement for Black Lives. Even as an information economy pushes potential allies to stockpile wealth in Silicon Valley or side with an authoritarian government, we can keep fighting for justice in the streets and online.We can start by making digital technologies and the data we need available to the masses and not simply to a minority owning class. Over 100 million people in this country aren’t connected to broadband at home in large part because of the cost, the majority of those not connected being from Black, Latino, Native and rural communities – This must change. In a society that relies heavily on the Internet to find jobs, do homework and check medical records, affordable access to modern communications systems is a cornerstone of equity.In a speech at the 2015 Computer, Internet and Society Conference, Center for Media Justice Director Malkia Cyril said, “whether the Internet disrupts the status quo or reinforces it is up to us.” Yes, we can be the tech leaders we need. We can demand, win and build an Internet that makes it harder to criminalize, trace and track religious, racial and ethnic minority groups, and that makes it harder to concentrate communications power and profits in the hands of the richest 1 percent. While we may also fight for laws that help keep the Internet equitable, communities of color know that technology is never neutral. We must be the ones to ensure that technology is on the right side, bending the moral arc toward a safer, more secure and less surveilled future. For our sake, may we make the winning side be justice.This post is part of the Black Futures Month blog series brought to you by The Huffington Post and the Black Lives Matter Network.

Education stands at the very heart of what will make America great, or what will destroy it. Yet, Betsy DeVos’ confirmation stands at 50/50 with only TWO Republicans voting against her.ONLY TWO!This is unconscionable. EVERY American should be outraged and frightened at the prospect. EVERY American should calling their representatives to stop DeVos from getting control of education in this country. And here’s why.1. She’s unqualified.· She has no experience in education· She has no advanced degrees in education· She has no experience or working knowledge of public schools, let alone inner-city schools and the challenges they face.DeVos is a billionaire fundraiser who got this nomination from a fellow billionaire as thanks for her support. She has no experience and no knowledge of the department over which she would be in charge. Her privileged childhood and education experiences are the only things that set her apart from most other Americans. She is being rewarded for being wealthy.2. She has one plan – vouchers.Though I attended public schools, I put my two kids in private school through 6th and 8th grades, respectively. Back then, as a conservative, vouchers would have been great. I spent roughly $12,000 a year on school tuition and other expenses. Though the early years were a struggle, I could afford it. Most parents cannot. And here are the problems with that.The voucher program only pays for part of tuition.That means money is taken out of the public school fund and given to parents who otherwise couldn’t afford private school. As a middle-class American, if you think that’s a good idea, consider that 63% of middle-income families are “only way paycheck away from the street.” If you can’t cover the balance, you kids will be kicked out of the private school and back into the public school system where they now have even less money to pay for a decent education. According to the Council for American Private Education, private schools account for 25% of the nations schools only enrolling about 10% of Pre-kindergarten to 12th grade. The average price of tuition, per child, in the 2011-2012 school year, was $13,640.Low-income and middle-income schools and kids would take the hitIn areas where property taxes foot the bill for education, income and rents are low. Vouchers would divert what little money there is from students and families who need it the most. Already, according to the Department of Education, 40% of low-income schools are not getting the money they need from state and local agencies.3. She has no idea what she’s up against.Americans have been lagging behind in education for years. Most Americans are not qualified for the 21st century job market (as evidenced by DeVos’s resume above). According to PISA, the Program International Student Assessment, an education assessment performed every three years by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), American students ranked 35th in math and science out of 64 countries.The tech industry recently scoffed at Donald Trump’s executive order against immigrants because they mostly rely on immigrants to bring the expertise they need for innovation. Technical skills aside, 60% of hiring managers in one survey said critical thinking and problem-solving skills was the most pressing problem with new hires. Our economic problem is not that jobs are leaving, it’s that Americans are woefully untrained and uneducated. The need for education is diverse. Speaking as a trained educator, the job is daunting and not cut out for someone who is handed the job like getting a new car from her daddy for graduating high school.3. Did I mention she’s unqualified?The Hill, a conservative news agency, believes DeVos will bring “opportunity, fairness to education.” It cited Obama’s failed school and grants program as evidence that DeVos could do better. The program was actually initiated by George Bush, and Obama tried to spruce it up by adding more money. There were many problems with the program from the beginning, and, unlike DeVos, Obama’s Secretary of education, Arne Duncan, held a sociology degree from Harvard and spent his life in and around education. If he struggled to make improvements, what could DeVos possibly have to offer?· She has no experience with low-income schools, let alone people.· She has no experience with special education· She has no experience working with unions and teachers· She has no working knowledge of the challenges middle-class families face in education· She has no experience with student loans· She has no experience with diversity or the needs of diverse populationsAnd as the Tennessean pointed out…“During the three-hour [confirmation] hearing, she refused to pledge to maintain public funding for public schools; evaded commitments to the educational rights of students with disabilities in schools receiving public funds; muddled the distinction between measures of student learning (which are commonly understood and very consequential in the lives of teachers and students); and casually overestimated by 800 percent the increase in student debt over the last eight years.”If your congressman isn’t voting against Betsy DeVos as the Secretary of Education, call them, email them and make sure they know this is a very bad decision for YOU and the rest of America.Click: How to find your representative."

It’s a truism of marketing that authenticity counts. What could be more passionate and authentic than a story that begins, “once upon a time, a young immigrant had a dream…”. Powerful back stories have been adapted for corporate marketing for decades now; It’s true of Proctor and Gamble, and of the mega-brewer, too.Still, the kerfuffle caused by the coincidental timing of Anheuser-Busch’s ad release (coming one week after a federal travel ban was announced via Presidential executive order, and then rescinded by the courts) was sufficient to cause the company to release a defensive statement that they were about selling their beer and their brand, and were not making a comment on religiously discriminatory bullying or politics. “Budweiser’s Super Bowl commercial highlights the ambition of our founder and his unrelenting pursuit of the American dream. This is a story about our heritage and the uncompromising commitment that goes into brewing our beer. It’s an idea we’ve been developing along with our creative agency for nearly a year.

In a press release the company said, “Throughout 2017, Budweiser will celebrate those who live life on their own terms and never back down.”Given the politicization even of Super Bowl ads, that last bit is a phrase worth remembering, in the current climate: never back down."

46,POLITICS,Demeaning Mexico Is Not In America’s Interest,"Gregory Shaffer, ContributorChancellor’s Professor, Author, Lecturer, and Commentator",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/demeaning-mexico-is-not-in-americas-interest_us_58979fa8e4b061551b3e0047,"Just over a week into his administration, President Trump has taken multiple steps that forebode economic, geopolitical and",2017-02-05,<p><strong>Buiilding $12 billion walls & crossing them</strong></p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5897a2982800002300996faa.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Just over a week into his administration, President Trump has taken multiple steps that forebode economic, geopolitical and humanitarian trouble for our southern neighbor. It may be popular among xenophobes, but it is not in America’s interest.Mr. Trump appears obsessed about his pledge that Mexico will pay for his ill-thought, 2,000-mile wall. Who constructs a wall and then asks their poorer neighbor to pay for it? America’s new president does.When Mexico, whose GDP is 11% of the United States’, naturally responded that it would not pay for the demeaning wall, Mr. Trump appeared to feel disrespected and his advisors searched for other means to meet his campaign promise. Mr. Trump announced he intends to impose a 20 percent discriminatory tax on Mexican imports to pay for the $12 billion dollar wall. Such a tax would violate not only American commitments under NAFTA, but also the anti-discrimination rules of the World Trade Organization. Trump may swerve back and choose a route that does not discriminate against Mexico and institute a new tax applied to imports and domestic products alike (similar to Mexico’s VAT). But while raising government revenue, such a consumption tax would just pass costs onto American consumers. They, not Mexico, would pay, though the spin would follow.America’s president’s recent rhetoric is the latest in a series of directives that could lead to the collapse of the U.S.-Mexico partnership.Mr. Trump made three primary pledges during his campaign—to withdraw from NAFTA unless Mexico accepts his terms, build a wall across the southern border and have Mexico pay for it, and deport undocumented Mexican migrants in mass. If he implements them, he could sever the relationship beyond repair. This would constitute a huge geopolitical mistake. Not only could these policies devastate Mexico, they will tarnish America’s reputation around the world and possibly upend the institutions that America created after World War II and the Cold War to protect global prosperity. They will, moreover, empower illiberal regimes, such as Russia and China.So why should Americans, even wholly self-interested ones, care about Mexican suffering from these policy shifts? Because they will adversely affect all Americans.First, Mexico is already suffering from low economic growth, and more than 80 percent of Mexican exports go to the United States. If the U.S. suddenly raises a discriminatory 20% tax on only Mexican products, it could severely damage Mexico’s economy, deterring productive investment, slashing Mexico’s GDP, and drying Mexican demand for U.S. products. Already the prospect of NAFTA’s demise has damaged Mexico. The Mexican peso’s value has plummeted, raising Mexicans’ cost of living and, ironically, making Mexican exports to the U.S. cheaper and even more competitive.Second, Mr. Trump has suggested that he also would like to tax or seize remissions being sent to families in Mexico to “make Mexico pay” for his wall. We don’t normally tax bank transfers and so it would again be discriminatory. Such a policy would further ravage Mexico’s economy. Reparations are Mexico’s largest single source of foreign income, surpassing even oil revenue.Third, the migration issue is now a false problem. Trump’s proposed mass deportation of an estimated six million unauthorized Mexican immigrants is at a time when net Mexican migration is negative (more Mexicans left the U.S. than entered under the Obama administration). This mass deportation would further catalyze an economic and humanitarian crisis. U.S. cities on the southern border would severely suffer when tourism, commerce, consumption, and productivity collapse. There is a dark and costly precedent to this, the Mexican “repatriation” of the 1930s.It doesn’t take much to see how actions that impoverish Mexicans will increase their economic desperation and spur them to leave their homes and increase the very migration that Mr. Trump says he seeks to contain. Mexican prosperity is in America’s interest, not contrary to it. The more we “push” Mexico into economic immiseration, the more we “pull” Mexicans here.Mexico, of course, would not take this lightly. After NAFTA, Mexico became a U.S. ally, while previously it took anti-U.S. stances internationally. If the Trump administration implements his pledges as announced, Mexico could abandon its alliance with the United States. Other Latin American countries could follow suit.No wonder China’s leaders envision creating a new partnership with Mexico as a substitute for the now defunct Transpacific Partnership — a deal that was designed to counter China’s influence and improve NAFTA. The Asian giant can now profit from a show of sympathy for a distressed Mexico, while increasing its economic and geopolitical prospects in Latin America.Mr Trump’s policies are not only mean and violate basic American values of non-discrimination. They would not only degrade Mexico economically, geopolitically, and humanitarianly. They would degrade America as well. If regional and international institutions collapse as a result of our president’s policies, America could find itself at a time last seen in the 1930s, that of the rise of fascism and communism. This time, it suddenly seems fair to question, on which side will America be?Sergio Puig is Associate Professor and Director of the International Trade and Business Law Program at James E.

During her pre-Super-Bowl show for DIRECTV in Houston, the pop star revealed she has no plans to perform for the rest of the year.“As far as I know I’m only doing one show in 2017, and as far as I know, this is that show,” she told the crowd, before giving the announcement a positive spin. “So what I’m trying to tell you is, by coming here tonight, you’re essentially attending 100 percent of my tour dates for the year, so thank you!” Swift made sure to give the crowd, which included an extremely enthusiastic Lea Michele, what they came for, though. The pop star played hits like “You Belong With Me,” “Shake It Off” and “Love Story.” She also performed her newest track, “I Don’t Wanna Live Forever” (sans Zayn), and “Better Man,” the song she wrote for Little Big Town. It was the first time Swift performed both tracks live.If you recall, Swift also performed only one live concert in 2016 ― at the Grand Prix ― which just so happened to be in Texas as well. Surely this just means the “22” singer is spending more time working on new music, right? We, and the Swifties of the world, can dream. "

Kelly “refused to comply,” Rogin wrote, attributing the information to “two administration officials familiar with the confrontation.”Many prominent journalists tweeted Rogin’s column. The dramatic showdown, as reported, would suggest Bannon was ignoring the presidential chain of command and trying to strong-arm a Cabinet member. The Post hours later walked back the column’s claims of a personal “confrontation,” but the story had already circulated widely on social media and was picked up by other news outlets. Spicer reached out to the Post Saturday morning and said there was no Bannon-Kelly faceoff, as had been reported, and disputed other details of the story.In an interview with HuffPost, Spicer said Bannon was not on a 2 a.m. Sunday conference call with senior staffers, as Rogin reported, and took issue with the columnist’s framing of a DHS press conference held on Tuesday. Spicer said he personally urged DHS to hold the press conference, though believed the columnist suggested the agency did so on its own. Spicer said the Post’s handling of the story, including Rogin’s failure to seek comment from the White House prior to publication, was “unbelievably unprofessional.” He said the Post owes its readers and the White House an apology.The Post appended an editor’s note to the column Saturday morning acknowledging that Rogin only approached DHS and not the White House. “We should have done both,” wrote editorial page editor Fred Hiatt, who oversees the Post’s columnists.On Saturday evening, the Post significantly updated Rogin’s column, which noted that “two sources” had said Bannon visited Kelly that day. The credibility of those sources has now been called into question, since the Post can’t verify that the meeting occurred and the White House has categorically denied it. Spicer insisted there was no confrontation between Bannon and Kelly over the green card issue, in person or otherwise.In an interview with HuffPost, Hiatt said the Post “still stand[s] by that they had a disagreement over whether green card holders should be included.”Hiatt acknowledged mistakes in the column. He said the Post responded to Spicer’s call by trying to “correct where it needed correcting and hold ourselves accountable.” Rogin, he said, will continue to follow up and “keep writing as he finds more stuff out.”“I think we got things wrong in this column,” Hiatt said. “That’s why we published an editor’s note and a correction. I regret getting things wrong. We try really hard not to, but we do make mistakes. And when we make mistakes, we try to correct them and be transparent to the readers what we got wrong.”Spicer, however, isn’t satisfied. He argued there’s double standard in how the news media aggressively fact-checks the administration, while the Post didn’t verify key details or approach the the White House in advance of publication. “The behavior of both Fred Hiatt and Josh Rogin is highly disturbing for people who look to The Washington Post for ‘news,’” Spicer said.

The general public, as well as animal advocacy groups and journalists, could use the search function to see whether facilities had violated animal welfare regulations.USDA APHIS attributed the change to concerns about privacy, adding in its announcement on Friday that the decision had come after a year of “comprehensive review.” “As a result of the comprehensive review, APHIS has implemented actions to remove certain personal information from documents it posts on APHIS’ website involving the Horse Protection Act and the Animal Welfare Act,” the agency said in a statement. “Going forward, APHIS will remove from its website inspection reports, regulatory correspondence, research facility annual reports, and enforcement records that have not received final adjudication.”The USDA APHIS site also makes a vague reference to court decisions, but does not cite any specific rulings that would require taking the data offline:Courts are continuously issuing decisions that provide agencies with guidance on interpreting and applying laws applicable to the release of information to the public by the Federal government, including the Privacy Act and Freedom of Information Act. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice maintains comprehensive guidance involving the Privacy Act, Freedom of Information Act, and other laws, and updates such guidance based on legal developments. APHIS, with the support from the Office of the General Counsel, continuously monitors these sources of information and refinements to APHIS’ practices are made accordingly.APHIS says people seeking inspection reports and related information can make a request to the USDA through the Freedom of Information Act, which can be done here. But as ABC News points out, FOIA requests can be expensive, and it can take months or years to receive the requested information.Numerous animal advocacy groups slammed the change. “This move makes it IMPOSSIBLE to find out where animals are located, their treatment and any violations, essentially giving carte blanche to anyone to hide animal violations, and violate animal welfare laws, among other things,” the Beagle Freedom Project, a lab animal rescue group, said in a statement on Facebook.The public deserves to have easy access to the information because taxpayer money funds the enforcement of the Animal Welfare Act, Kate Dylewsky of conservation and animal rights group Born Free USA said in a statement obtained by The Dodo.“The public has a right to know what the government is doing, and this is a blow to both government transparency and to animal advocates’ ability to hold animal abusers publicly accountable,” she said.The information disappeared from the USDA website two days after Rep. Ken Calvert (R-Calif.) introduced a bill to increase transparency surrounding taxpayer-funded animal testing.One member of President Donald Trump’s USDA transition team, Brian Klippenstein, has a long history of fighting animal welfare regulations. Klippenstein is executive director of Protect the Harvest, a group that, among other things, has vehemently opposed legislation meant to fight abusive puppy mills."

The crowd held a sea of creative signs, including, “We bombed them, now we ban them,” and “Instead of being afraid of brown people, we should be more concerned over orange monster.”Anti-Trump gatherings also were reported in New York, Missouri, Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, Houston, and West Palm Beach, Florida, where Trump is spending the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago resort.The Washington march was organized by “Peace for Iran,” a small group of Iranian American young professionals who first came together to promote the Iran nuclear deal. Marchers, however, came from a variety of backgrounds. Families from the Virginia and Maryland suburbs joined college students and teenagers from the city in chants like, “When Muslims are under attack ― what do we do? Stand up, fight back.”Nader Davoodi, 67, and his wife Mahin, 64, are Iranian-born American citizens who came to the demonstration from Gaithersburg, Maryland. The last time they came out to a protest was against an Iranian government official visiting Washington several years ago.Although as citizens they are not affected by the ban, Nader Davoodi said, “I come for everybody else all around the world. We need a peaceful government ― not Donald Trump.”Sara Krautbauer, 29, a master’s student in international development at George Washington University, came with about 20 of her fellow volunteers at the Refugee Assistance Program, an organization that helps refugees resettling in the Washington area.Krautbauer welcomed the Trump administration’s decision to put the ban on hold in response to a federal judge’s ruling on Friday night, but described the delay as insufficient.“It’s awesome for visa holders and green card holders, but we’re here for refugees as well,” Krautbauer said. “Walking back the ban only so far isn’t good enough. They need to walk it all the way back so we can start bringing back refugees again.”More than 200 miles north in Manhattan’s West Village, thousands of supporters of LGBTQ rights demonstrated against Trump’s ban and other policies outside the Stonewall Inn, the site of the historic showdown over gay rights.“Whether we’re straight, gay, immigrant, Native American ― no matter who you are, we’re all standing up to fascists,” said Marie Carianna, a 57-year-old lesbian.The American Civil Liberties Union, which has challenged the ban in court, asked Twitter users to share photos of their protests .People responded with photos and video of demonstrations in major cities, including Philadelphia, Salt Lake City and Los Angeles, as well as smaller ones: Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania; Raleigh, North Carolina; and North Adams, Massachusetts.They were joined by solidarity demonstrations in London and Paris, as well.In Trump’s backyard, Saturday marked the third straight weekend in which Washington was the site of anti-Trump demonstrations. On Jan. 21, progressives from all over the country converged on the capital for the Women’s March. On Sunday, a short-notice rally against Trump’s travel and immigration executive order packed Lafayette Square park in front of the White House. But activists at Saturday’s White House demonstration said they are pressuring Congress as well. Krautbauer uses a Google spreadsheet circulated on the internet with the names of members of Congress who support the new restrictions on refugee admission and said she calls two of them every day. Jon Sokolow, 57, who came to the rally from Reston, Virginia, with his wife, Diana, and their daughter, Christina Dawson, 26, has been combining his protests with calls to Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine (D-Va.). He is urging them to resist Trump’s agenda.Asked whether that included filibustering Trump’s Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, Sokolow was unequivocal. “Absolutely! It’s a stolen seat,” he said, referring to Republicans’ refusal to consider Obama’s nominee Merrick Garland.Sebastian Murdock contributed reporting."

Only 21 percent expressed surprise at his performance so far. But doing the job in line with Americans’ expectations isn’t necessarily a good thing. Just 42 percent of Americans think Trump is meeting expectations in a good way. Thirty-five percent say he’s meeting their expectations of a poor performance in office. Just 3 percent say he’s handling the office in an unexpectedly good way, while 17 percent say he’s doing a worse job than they anticipated. Of course, views of Trump’s performance are split along partisan lines. Republicans overwhelmingly view his first two weeks in a positive light: 83 percent say he’s doing as they expected in a good way, and another 6 percent say he’s surprised them in a good way. Conversely, 55 percent of Democrats say he’s doing what they expected and that’s bad, while another 30 percent say he’s doing unexpectedly badly. Independents are almost evenly split.Trump’s job approval rating overall is 44 percent in the CNN/ORC poll, with 53 percent disapproving of how he’s handling the job. That’s the lowest approval rating the poll has ever recorded for a new president, going all the way back to Dwight Eisenhower. Trump claimed the title from Ronald Reagan, who had an approval rating of 51 percent in 1981.Trump’s approval ratings have varied quite a bit in his first two weeks in office, depending on which poll you look at. CNN/ORC’s 44 percent is in line with the HuffPost Pollster aggregate. Disapproval is slightly lower, at 50 percent in the HuffPost Pollster chart. There have been 19 approval rating polls released in the first two weeks of Trump’s administration, ranging from an approval rating 18 points higher than disapproval, to 9 points underwater. Most polls have shown the president’s disapproval is higher than his approval. Trump doesn’t fare much better on policy areas. A majority disapproves of how he’s handling terrorism, health care policy, immigration and foreign affairs. Slight pluralities approve of his performance on the economy and national security. The CNN/ORC poll was conducted via landline and cellular telephones from Jan. 31 to Feb. 2, and consists of 1,002 American adults. The margin of sampling error is +/- 3 percentage points for the full sample, +/- 5.5 percentage points for Democrats, +/- 6 percentage points for Republicans, and +/- 4.5 percentage points for independents.

Organizer Justin Swindle, 27, said it all began as a joke with friends. ""It somehow got super popular, so we tried to make it matter by collecting donations,"" he said. Donations will be given to the International Center of Kentucky.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/589565471900001800e09fea.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Dear Mr. President:I write to you today from the small picturesque American town of Bowling Green, Kentucky, which I was shocked to learn from Kellyanne this week was the site of the #BowlingGreenMassacre.At first, I thought maybe she was talking about the town in Ohio. They have Bowling Green State University and are always getting confused with us. Also, they are located in a swing state and, as a political journalist, I don’t trust anything coming out of Ohio right now.Then I wondered why my colleagues at Western Kentucky University had not mentioned the massacre to me in the years since I joined the faculty. Kellyanne noted that the media didn’t cover the massacre, so surely my colleagues in the journalism school must have been in on the cover up! I am astounded and, frankly, impressed: Having worked as a reporter in the “lamestream” media before becoming a professor, I am adept at oppressing white men and inserting anti-Christian messaging into all of my news articles. But to successfully cover up a massacre committed by Middle Eastern terrorists in the height of the information age just a decade after 9/11? Wow. Maybe the old guys with tenure have something to teach me after all.In Bowling Green, we have a very large refugee community. In fact, in our small town of about 60,000 people, one in 10 residents is foreign born. Because of the refugee center located here, we even have white Muslims. (Betcha didn’t think about them!) Turns out this whole taking refugees thing goes back decades, and many of the pillars of our business community came here as refugees from Bosnia in the 1990s. We also have a sizable population of refugees from the Middle East, Asia and Africa. The international flavor of our town isn’t just metaphorical: I live near “Little Mexico,” the offensively nicknamed neighborhood surrounding the city’s best taquerias and pupuserias. (Please don’t build a wall between us.)Even at the university, one cannot escape the diversity. WKU calls itself “a leading American university with international reach.” We have 1,300 international students from 70 countries — 22 of which are from the seven countries included in your ban and have already had their lives and educational plans impacted “bigly.” Lucky for us, though, a large number of our international students are from Saudi Arabia, the home country of most of the 9/11 hijackers. I know Saudi Arabia surely is not a terrorist threat, though, because you didn’t include it among the countries in your refugee ban.To be honest, despite the 2011 incident, I’ve never felt threatened by the refugees or the international students in our community. As a professor these days, I fret on a daily basis of being listed on Professor Watchlist or being taken down by “call-out culture” for failing to deliver an appropriate trigger warning before quoting you in class. (This whole pussy-grabbing thing is difficult to discuss, I have to say.) We did have a recent incident in Bowling Green in which an attacker evoked ISIS — but that was our star football player, Tyler Higbee, who allegedly yelled “ISIS these nuts” to the Middle Eastern man he knocked out in front of a food truck last April. But Tyler is now in the NFL, so clearly he’s not dangerous.You know what is a threat? CNN. Since you have taken office, my entire world turned upside down. I thought I knew what fake news was, and then you started telling the world that it was CNN. I thought I understood the definition of “truth,” but then Kellyanne explained “alternative facts.” I just don’t know what to teach anymore...Sorry to get emotional and write such a long letter! (And my apologies to whomever was charged with reading this aloud to you.) But ever since that rally in Ohio when you turned toward me and my students and all the other media at the event and called us “disgusting,” I have felt a connection. I think you get me, you know?So I really do want to invite you to come visit us in Bowling Green. Kellyanne’s comments have emboldened the community, which is expected to show up en masse to a unity walk on Saturday to support refugees. When you visit, we’ll let Sen. Paul join us for bourbon. I know you and Rand haven’t been close, but he lives just down the street, and the last time I saw him, he was at a bar during one of the final Republican primary debates drinking alone. Tell Kellyanne and Steve to come, too. Despite all the refugees, I think Steve will really like it: The town is still pretty much segregated and even our squirrels are white!Well, I’ve got to go — there is a candlelight vigil tonight downtown organized by some anti-fascist activists. I’ll tell them you said “hello.”Keep it real, or . . .-ajAmanda J. Crawford is an essayist and professor of journalism at Western Kentucky University in Bowling Green, Kentucky "

For the past decade, I’ve worked within a movement that upholds values of “good, clean and fair,” yet remains quiet or woefully tone-deaf in conversations about black and brown people, specifically in regards to racism, state-sanctioned violence, and rising inequality. Whether I’m simmering large vats of Blenheim apricots for award-winning artisan preserves (what up, Mrs. Abby Fisher!), frying up cornmeal-crusted local fish filets for a community dinner, chatting with black youth on how to organize around better school lunches, or helping expand EBT SNAP benefits at farmer’s markets, it’s ultimately about nourishing and uplifting people. In a very real sense, the future of food is people. And that future looks a lot like me: a young, black woman, hungry for change.This future was also written long ago. You see, my journey to feed others well was paved by black women across food landscape for generations before me From the revered restaurant of the iconic Leah Chase, to the soulful sophistication of Edna Lewis’ cooking, to the field organizing of activist-farmer Fannie Lou Hamer, black women have been central figures in the public development of American cuisine. Beyond these accolades, our country’s has a deeper history still of countless lesser-known black women, enslaved in fields and kitchens, who have fed children not their own and who have long shaped our most celebrated foodways, recipes and sustainable agricultural practices. Despite this rich history, I often feel alone. Our national good food obsession can curate Instagrams of oozing sandwich stacks higher than black folks’ restaurant wages. Our movement marches against an unknown impact of GMOs, but not to change the known dearth of food spaces with black CEOs. Without my people up front and counted, the good food movement is deafeningly hollow. I’m tired of good intentions served up on white guilt–driven platters. And whenever I’m met with yet another eye-rolling marketing campaign Columbusing collards, the erasure of black folks is painfully felt. The good food movement hasn’t fully figured out how to effectively center the literal bodies that wash our Heath ceramic dishes or gingerly prepare our $125 tasting menus. All of this is very hard to swallow. Especially when black people still struggle to put good meals on their tables every day due to the rising costs of food and the lasting impact of supermarket redlining. Black farmers still operate less than a half percent of U.S. farmland, and black people are crushingly excluded from good restaurant jobs. The ownership of food businesses and access to necessary capital are still highly stratified along racial lines. And the winners of profit margin-critical food awards and accolades are still as homogenous as selfies of a Trump-era House GOP. The time is now to respond to how physical, psychological, and economic violence and neglect disproportionately impact black and brown communities, particularly through our food and farming system. There are specific in ways that food and farming issues intersect with movement building to empower and liberate black people. I cannot separate my identities as a “food person” and a “Black person;” the changing future of food and farming means organizing and feeding folks at this critical intersection. But, I am not doing this work by my damn self. The good food movement and its leaders have a social responsibility to acknowledge and address the ways in which systems of oppression marginalize people of color, inside and out of our industry. The good food movement is not exempt from this crucial work because it appears to “not be our problem.” For instance, when our co-workers in the fields or in kitchens are targeted and face unlawful detentions because of collusion between local police departments and ICE – it’s a food problem. When big food retailers are allowed to rely on cheap, prison labor to produce goods – it’s a food problem. When Black and Native American farmers faced decades of systemic bias in access to capital and credit and land loss from the USDA – it’s a food problem. When young people have to organize non-violent, direct action to raise awareness of BLM in silent/tone-deaf food spaces within their own communities – it’s a food problem. When we simply prioritize well-intentioned ideas around “nutrition and access,” but ignore the resulting racial inequity, gentrification and increased police surveillance in communities of color – it’s a food problem.The good food movement needs to demonstrate an understanding that food injustice parallels racial injustice. Our Movement for Black Lives can continue to create points of collaboration where food people and food spaces can be included within strategies for our resistance. We already know that people of color disproportionately bear the burden of diet-related illnesses, poverty and a lack of access to fresh, affordable food. These health and socio-economic factors serve as the salt in a festering, deep wound that we must bind and heal through self-determination, equity and right relationship with the land.And it is young black people who will lead the conversation on changing our food and farming systems. Our healing will come and bellies will be full when we dismantle corporate control of our food systems by empowering our own communities. This is already happening. We’re teaching our own to launch good food businesses. We’re going back to the land on our terms and with our own seeds. We’re creating space for conversations at the intersection of food and race. We’re telling our own good food stories. We’re unapologetically disrupting white-dominated artisan food industries and leading our own kitchens. We’re directing investments to black-owned food startups and reshaping ownership in our cities to reclaim space and economic equity. We’re starting organizing networks within food spaces to force a power paradigm shift.My sincere hope lies in the the words of Father Mark Day in his sweet dedication of “40 Acres.” May we continue to “gain a more abundant share in the harvest of our endless toil.” I’ll see you at the table.This post is part of the Black Futures Month blog series brought to you by The Huffington Post and the Black Lives Matter Network.

I hope that signals more independence ahead. For me, personally, there is a bit of a back story.In July, 2010, President Obama used his recess appointment authority to make me the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services – CMS. That was not the original plan. When I was first asked to do that job, in 2008, shortly after the presidential election, the aim was a Senate confirmation. But with the polarized politics following that election and the intense maneuvering that led to the narrow passage of the Affordable Care Act, the administration judged it better to delay my formal nomination for almost a year and a half, until April, 2010. By then, hope for my prompt confirmation was gone, and recess appointment was the only timely option the president had. CMS had had only Acting administrators for the previous six years, and, especially given its extensive role in implementing the ACA, leadership there had become an urgent priority. The administration told me that it hoped for enough détente in the ensuing months to move my confirmation forward in the Senate. But that was not to be. In March, 2011, 42 senators, led by Senator Orrin Hatch, sent a letter to President Obama demanding that he withdraw my nomination. That letter was dripping with misinformation and completely ignored the extensive support for my nomination from a wide range of health care stakeholders, most of whom knew me far better than the signatories did. The president stuck by me. But, no matter; 60 Senate votes were required to beat a filibuster, and my confirmation was therefore dead. I served for the rest of my recess appointment term, which ended in December, 2011.Leading CMS gave me the chance to contribute to the health and wellbeing of tens of millions of Americans and to launch a fleet of effective efforts to help make our health care system better. I felt lucky to serve, and sad to have to leave. But, there is a sweet nuance to the story: five of the then 47 Republican senators did not join the 42 who signed the Hatch letter. Two are no longer in office: Scott Brown and Olympia Snow. But three are: Senator Susan Collins, Senator Lisa Murkowski, and Senator Rob Portman. Given the hermetic party discipline of that time, their dissent seemed remarkable. I did not know then, nor do I now, why they did not sign. Maybe they just missed the memo. Or maybe they were holding out for the due process and fair play of an open hearing. Or maybe they trusted the judgment of the American Hospital Association, the American Medical Association, AARP, and dozens of others who had praised my nomination.I prefer to assume that their abstention was an act of courage and reason. That they were placing considered judgment above pure party loyalty. Some form of conscience and respect, I choose to believe, led these three to dissent from the party line. For that, I am grateful. That small story deserves, at most, a footnote in the annals of political courage. In the big scheme, it didn’t really matter much. Many other Americans could have led CMS well. But, in the era we are about to enter, courage of the same type, the courage to dissent in the interests of the public and the truth, will matter. It will matter monumentally. The Trump administration is showing recklessness terrifying to those who pray for the protection of the environment, peace, the poor, the ill, the dislocated. We face cabinet nominees publicly committed to destroying the agencies they would lead, health care legislation that would return tens of millions to the nightmare of medical bankruptcy, diplomatic and economic policies that would isolate our nation and renege on longstanding promises, and intemperance that could make even nuclear conflict more likely. Senator Collins, Senator Murkowski, and Senator Portman, perhaps you did not want the role you now will play, but it is yours nonetheless. The Republicans hold 52 Senate seats in the new Congress. It will take only three of those votes to block unwise legislation. You are now one of the very few plausible bulwarks against irresponsible governing at the highest levels in our nation. I surely hope that more of your party colleagues would join when it counts, but let’s be clear: you are enough. Once, with me, on a far smaller stage with far fewer consequences, you chose dignity, stewardship, and judgment – not the party line – as your guides. Thank you. Now, please, choose that course again, and stay that course, when the fate of so many people, nations, and even our planet will ride on your courage."

The residential hall is named for John C. Calhoun, a former U.S. Vice President and ardent advocate of slavery.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/589547d3280000f814996cfc.jpg?ops=crop_317_58_2243_1167%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Months after a dining hall worker broke a window glorifying slavery at Yale’s Calhoun’s college, the university appears to be reversing course on its official position on racist symbols from the past.The symbols in question surround Calhoun College: the residential hall named for former vice president and avid proponent of slavery John C. Calhoun. Also at issue is a plethora of art on campus, including a suite of stained glass windows that commemorate his life.In December, the 12 member panel known as The Committee to Establish Principle on Renaming released a 24 page report laying the groundwork for the school to rename Calhoun. Next week a Task force will meet to recommend a new name for the building, The Yale Daily News reported on Thursday.In April, Yale committed to examine its art after a yearlong campaign from NEXT YALE, but flatly refused to change the name of the residential hall. In a letter to the Yale community, university president Peter Salovey said it was important to keep the name to remember the legacy of slavery.“After a careful review of student and alumni responses, scholarly views, and public commentary—which were exceptionally thoughtful, measured, and helpful on all aspects of the question—it became evident that renaming could have the opposite effect of the one intended,” Salovey wrote in a campus-wide e-mail. “Removing Calhoun’s name obscures the legacy of slavery rather than addressing it.”That was supposedly the end of it, until Corey Menaffee, a Yale dishwasher, took a broom and knocked out a stained glass window in Calhoun College that depicted slaves carrying bales of cotton.After the window was broken, the college removed “a ‘suite’ in the Common Room devoted to Calhoun himself, and several windows in the dining hall, including the remains of the shattered one and one that included a Black minstrel,” according to Calhoun head Julia Adams.Maya Jenkins, an activist with the Black Student Alliance at Yale and resident of Calhoun College, told the Huffington Post in October that the university’s slow and measured response to student outrage over the name was an attempt to co-opt the movement.“I think the creation of these committees is an attempt to re-write history. If they change the name, in the collective memory it came from the committee, it came from this bureaucratic, tame, well reasoned argument,” Jenkins said in a telephone interview. “There was a lot of salience to the fact that it was a black Yale employee who broke that stained glass window and was then arrested for it.”In July, Menafee’s actions became public when Yale had him arrested and pressed charges against him. The arrest made Menaffee a national sensation, and over thirty thousand dollars had been raised for him in less than a month. The university decided to drop criminal charges and re-hire Menafee in a different dining hall. In return, Menafee agreed he would never speak of the incident to media again.Catherine John, a 37 year old New Haven resident who used to work in the payment processing division of Yale Medical group, led protests outside the dining throughout the summer. When asked if she had ever been contacted for input from the committee, she laughed.“Really? Hell no. But if they wanted our input, they’d know where to find us.”The Task Force will meet next week to propose new names for the building.>"

She wasn’t above poking fun gently at how some of the other elderly residents walked or behaved! She was so graceful, right to the end. Her life was a lesson in how to age gracefully.”Mitchell has a message for legislators considering the Kupuna Caregivers Assistance bill SB534. They should understand, he says, that people’s desire to care for their loved ones causes them to do irrational things. “Caregivers damage themselves, we neglect our own needs, we sell our assets, we put ourselves on the backburner, we make decisions under duress and we sometimes take on unconscionable levels of debt.

61,SPORTS,Former NFL Player Husain Abdullah: Trump Is 'Spreading Hate' With Muslim Ban,Travis Waldron,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/husain-abdullah-nfl-trump-immigration-ban_us_5894e414e4b040613136e615,"One of the most prominent Muslims to play pro football says Trump is ""absolutely"" targeting the religion.",2017-02-04,"Husain Abdullah, here as a free safety for the Kansas City Chiefs in 2014, says, ""It’s only going to get worse if people don’t stand up and they don’t protest.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5894e6452800001f00996c1c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Husain Abdullah didn’t find out that President Donald Trump had signed an executive order temporarily banning refugees and travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries until Saturday morning, when a friend posted a video of protesters at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport to Snapchat.The night before, Abdullah ― a practicing Muslim who played seven seasons as an NFL free safety before he retired in 2016 ― had been consumed with preparing for a trip to Rwanda with a group of his fellow graduate students at Southern Methodist University. But when he saw the video, he instantly hopped online to figure out what was going on. He didn’t like what he saw.“When it comes to what’s going on socially, he’s spread a lot of hate,” Abdullah said of Trump on Friday. “Yes, we have to have immigration laws, but everyone has to be subject to the same laws. When you start to discriminate against people based on their religion, that becomes a huge issue.”Abdullah and his brother Hamza, also a former NFL player, are two of the most prominent Muslims to have played professional football. Their faith became a well-known aspect of their careers in 2012, when they skipped the NFL season to make a religious pilgrimage to Mecca.Trump has argued that his order doesn’t specifically single out Muslims. But Abdullah doesn’t buy it, especially after a campaign in which Trump “targeted quite a few people” ― including Mexican and Latino immigrants, women, African-Americans and people with disabilities.“Absolutely, Muslims are being targeted,” Abdullah said. “There will be other groups targeted as well. It’s only going to get worse if people don’t stand up and they don’t protest, and we don’t have lawyers working and politicians working to block these orders and to slow these things down. If everybody just says this is the way it is, it’s going to get ugly real quick.”That responsibility, Abdullah said, also extends to the NFL. Some players have spoken out, but Commissioner Roger Goodell chose not to. Asked about Trump’s executive order at a news conference Wednesday, Goodell said that he is “singularly focused on the Super Bowl.”“Knowing how the NFL operates, they just want to stay as clean as they can,” Abdullah said. “They don’t want to talk about anything other than football. They tell all of us, just football. Nothing else. Anything other than football is labeled a distraction. The reality is, if there’s a social issue plaguing the country and now plaguing the globe ... we need these giant organizations and people who are running them to speak up on it.”Goodell’s reticence to comment, Abdullah said, creates a dynamic in which players are less likely to speak out. “When the NFL does something like that ― ‘oh, we’re not worried about that; we’re just focused on football’ ― now for everybody who’s Muslim or everybody who probably doesn’t share the majority religious opinion, now they’re more than likely [thinking], ‘Man, if I say something, then now they’re going to single me out, or they’re going to target me,’” he said. “They have to do a better job of paying attention to what’s going on socially. And not only how it affects America or society at large, but also how it affects their players.”Abdullah, who retired after suffering the fifth concussion of his career last season, is pursuing a master’s in dispute resolution and conflict management at SMU in Dallas. In March, he’ll travel to Rwanda to work with a school for orphans.And while he knows many people are fearful of Trump’s policies, recent events have only hardened his resolve to pursue a field that will allow him to help people. “I’m feeling a sense of urgency, in a positive way. Not out of fear, but just in a positive way,” Abdullah said. “Emotions ... can either paralyze you and you can fall into depression and despair and worry, or you can channel the emotion, whether it’s good or bad, and you can use it for a positive cause.”“Football was purposeful. I was passionate about it. Now, with what’s going on right now, this is my purpose. This is my passion. I just have a sense of urgency to be a product of change for the better.”Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

She says she did not have any problems with her co-workers until she began wearing a hijab at work in 2008. Over the next few years, the suit states, her colleagues engaged in daily verbal abuse, including calling her names like “terrorist” and “Taliban” and telling her she shouldn’t be a police officer. Alamrani says she reported the harassment but that the NYPD didn’t take any action.She alleges that two defendants named in the suit, Josephine Barone-Baur and Leanna Brown, physically attacked her, called her “Muslim bitch” and attempted to rip off her hijab in 2012. Brown and Barone-Baur were merely moved to work a different shift from Alamrani after the department conducted an investigation, according to the suit.The suit says the harassment continued to escalate until 2014, when Alamrani says an officer responded to a noise complaint at her residence by detaining her and her children for eight hours, apparently just for the purpose of harassing her. A co-worker allegedly posted online a photo of Alamrani at a gun range, which she visited for work-related reason, the following year ― and numerous other co-workers responded with malicious comments, including calling her a “fucking disgrace” and a “moving target.”Alamrani also alleges that she was repeatedly given undesirable shifts or had her duties unfairly limited, like getting moved off patrol duty, because of her religion or the fact that she wore a hijab.She responded to the years of alleged abuse in 2015 by retiring early, although she joined the force again a few months later in a new precinct.Alamrani’s attorney, Jesse Rose, told the New York Daily News that the NYPD had chosen to treat his client poorly rather than improve community relations.“The NYPD had the opportunity to show that the people who police us look like the community they police,” Rose said. “Instead, they put her to the side and changed her assignment so she was not visible to the public.”A spokesman for the New York City Law Department told The Huffington Post that it would review the complaint.In recognition the growing amount of harassment and discrimination that Muslims — or people perceived to be Muslim — face in the workplace, the U.S. Equal Opportunity Employment Commission last year issued guidelines for employers. The commission noted that it started seeing a major uptick in discrimination charges involving Muslims in the months immediately following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.“While the number of charges directly related to 9/11 has dwindled, the Commission continues to see an increase in charges involving religious discrimination against Muslims and alleging national origin discrimination against Muslims or those with a Middle Eastern background,” the EEOC wrote."

Four students were killed and nine injured.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58953694280000f314996ceb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A Republican Party official in northern Michigan has issued what amounts to a death threat against American college protesters, calling for “another Kent State” in the wake of protests at the University of California, Berkeley.In 1970, members of the Ohio National Guard fired on unarmed Kent State University students protesting the U.S. incursion into Cambodia. Guardsmen killed four students and wounded nine, including one who was paralyzed for life.Dan Adamini, former chair and current secretary of the Marquette County Republican Party, indicated that a single death might be sufficient to end student protests this time around.“I’m thinking another Kent State might be the only solution protest stopped after only one death,” he posted on Facebook on Thursday. “They do it because they know there are no consequences yet.”He also tweeted: “Violent protesters who shut down free speech? Time for another Kent State perhaps. One bullet stops a lot of thuggery.”The comment ignited outrage. Adamini’s comments are “sickening, inhuman, and indefensible,” Brandon Dillon, chair of the Michigan Democratic Party, said in a statement. “There is no ambiguity or alternative interpretation. To call for ‘another Kent State’ and declare that ‘one bullet stops a lot of thuggery’ is to clearly and openly advocate for the murder of unarmed college students, simply because they don’t share his beliefs or point of view.” Dillon called for Adamini to apologize and resign from the GOP.Doreen Takalo, a member of the Marquette County Republican Party, insisted to The Marquette Mining Journal, “We’ve always been a peaceful group,” adding that the “majority of us do not advocate for violence.” Takalo said she suspected Adamini hadn’t “meant it exactly the way he said it.”“May 4, 1970, was a watershed moment for the country and especially the Kent State University family. We lost four students that day while nine others were wounded and countless others were changed forever,” the school said. “This abhorrent post is in poor taste and trivializes a loss of life that still pains the Kent State community today.”Adamini posted the comments after violent protests erupted Wednesday night on the Berkeley campus over a scheduled speech by ultra-conservative provocateur and white nationalist Milo Yiannopoulos, 32. The Berkeley College Republicans had invited the Breitbart editor, who’s been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment, to address an audience of 500. About 1,500 people demonstrated, with some toppling light poles, starting fires and hurling objects at officers before the speech was canceled.Though defending Yiannopoulos’ right to speak, Berkeley’s chancellor, Nicholas Dirks, in a statement last week called him a “troll and provocateur who uses odious behavior in part to ‘entertain,’ but also to deflect any serious engagement with ideas.”Several Republicans, including President Donald Trump, characterized the protests as a blow to freedom of speech. Trump hinted at cutting off Berkeley’s federal funding.Following the uproar over his comments, Adamini scrambled to walk back what he said.“What I was trying to get across, apparently very poorly, is that the violence at the college campus in Berkeley was reminiscent of the violence on college campuses in the ’60s,” said Adamini, who hosts a local radio program, “In the Right Mind,” on WDMJ/WIAN. “I fear that if we cannot get a handle on the violence, we might see the same type of tragic end,” he told The Mining Journal.“I was not calling for violence against the protesters. I was calling for a stop to the violence by the protesters.”He said he has taken down his Facebook page because of “hateful” comments.Kate Abbey-Lambertz contributed to this report.

Many of us can agree we’ve wasted many morning commutes erratically scrolling through aspirational images of our female peers with a sinking sense of depreciation.The Ugly TruthWhy do we look at these selfies? Aspiration. Motivation. #Goals.What does this actually achieve? Comparison. Self-criticism. Envy.Envy is an ugly thing. We don’t want to admit we feel inadequate or that we are doubtful of ourselves. Instead we feel envy that stirs up feelings of competition in all of us. She has something we want.Competition is a defence mechanism for inadequacy. The truth is, we’d rather feel a sense of competition than admit she has something we want. And what does competition lead to? Individualism.Now don’t get me wrong, individualism is good. However, there is a sort of individualism that produces a false independence, a fear of social intimacy, an unfounded assumption of others. The sad thing about the individualism that I’m talking about is that it is one that is immobilised by insecurity.Let’s be honest, we are never going to achieve the exact same success we see on Instagram. Everyone’s measure and nature of success is different. More concerning still, these images are deliberate reconstructions and are not always authentic or achievable. As a result we’re breeding inferiority amongst women.The Ugly CycleWhy do we upload these selfies? Recognition. Affirmation. Achievement.What does this actually achieve? A search for an identity on other people’s terms.This is a losing battle.We can all build ourselves a digital avatar, an online personality through a carefully manipulated lens, a reward system based upon a reliance of others. What Instagram is actually doing is setting us apart more. It’s manufacturing a cycle built on destructive individualism and competition between women.“My life is better than yours.”I’m not saying you shouldn’t be able to share your lives with your friends. But there is such thing as a balance and sharing intimate snaps for the right reasons. We shouldn’t feel the need to find an identity in relation to others.Rather than sitting back and voyeuristically judging other women and ourselves, we should be forming real connections and relationships. Instagram makes it very easy to become passive, detached from reality and unsatisfied.I’ve got a few pieces of advice, my fellow females. Next time you meet someone (virtually or physically) that begins to stir up envy, just think:She is an individual who is more than her image.She has insecurities of her own, like you.She has helped you understand more about what you might like to achieve in your own way.You will fulfil your own personal ambitions on your terms.Stay awesome and support each other, Ladies."

67,WORLDPOST,How To Change Iran Government Peacefully?,"Dr. Majid Rafizadeh, ContributorPresident of the International American Council",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-to-change-iran-govern_b_14606566.html,,2017-02-04,2016-11-13-1479004050-2330233-DrRafizadehHarvard.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-11-13-1479004050-2330233-DrRafizadehHarvard-thumb.png,"Hoping that the Iranian government would suddenly become a constructive, responsible, and rational member of the international community on its own is unrealistic. Fundamental changes from within the Iranian government, that would alter the revolutionary principles, are inconceivable. This is because the ruling clerics' theocratic constitution has confined Iran with such unbending legal and social restrictions that change is made impossible, and the political establishment of the ruling clerics is becoming more and more incompatible with the standards, rules and international laws of the international community.In addition, according to the Islamic Republic's constitution, people do not have the right to change the fundamentals of the constitution; only the Supreme Leader has such a right. Many politicians, policy analysts, and scholars have been arguing for a long time, since 1979, that the Islamic Republic of Iran will change for the better honoring its own citizens and the rules of the international community. However, history has forcefully shown that their arguments have repeatedly failed.There exist ample reasons why moderating the Iranian government and a change in the Iranian government from a Shiite theocracy toward a democratic system of governance would be conducive and beneficial not only to the Iranian people, but also for the regional and global stability, peace and security.Instead of delving into these reasons, which are evident and explicit, the major question to address would be: what are some effective and non-violent approaches to channel such democratic reform in Iran?Some critical approaches include standing with the Iranian youth, pressure from international community, focusing on Iran's human rights, violations of international laws and suppression of religious and ethnic minorities as well as human rights groups, providing Iran's opposition with social media and technologic assistances, and supporting oppositional groups. _____________________For more details and nuances, you can read full version on Here.You can sign up for Dr. Rafizadeh's newsletter for the latest news and analyses on Here.

68,POLITICS,Refugee Resettlement Offices May Be Forced To Shut Down Under Donald Trump's Ban,Willa Frej and Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/refugee-resettlement-offices-shutting-down_us_5894e225e4b0c1284f25efdf,"“We definitely need the community’s support to move forward over the next 120 days,” one director said.",2017-02-03,"A protester plays ""This Land Is Your Land"" on a trumpet during a demonstration against the ban on immigration issued by President Donald Trump at Logan International Airport on Jan. 28 in Boston.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5894e3ad25000032080b6cd8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"U.S. refugee resettlement offices may have to downsize because of President Donald Trump’s executive order restricting the number of persecuted people welcomed to the United States and will likely have to carry out major fundraising campaigns to stay afloat.What they fear the most is that it will hurt refugees who are already here and who rely on resettlement offices to help them adjust to life in a new country. “We definitely need the community’s support to move forward over the next 120 days,” said Megan Johnson, director of the Church World Service office in Jersey City. Trump’s order, signed one week ago, halts refugee resettlement entirely for 120 days and blocks Syrian refugees indefinitely. It also cuts refugee admissions for the 2017 fiscal year from the 110,000 proposed by President Barack Obama to 50,000. Lower refugee numbers means less funding for resettlement organizations (particularly those that primarily serve Syrian refugees), which now may have to fire staff or potentially close their doors. Implicit in any halt of the refugee program is also a pause in federal funding for refugee resettlement organizations. The break in funding will begin March 31, according to Mark Hetfield, CEO of HIAS, one of the nine domestic resettlement organizations.The amount of funding the government doles out is contingent on the number of refugees each organization resettles, Jane Graupman, executive director of the International Institute of Minnesota, told The Huffington Post. IIMN is a local affiliate of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, another of the domestic resettlement agencies.Once the State Department has approved refugee cases, it delegates them to one of those agencies. They meet on a weekly basis to divvy up newcomers and figure out which group will assist them in resettlement and which city each person or family will be resettled in.“We haven’t been given any clear instructions but we do know that it means a quarter-of-a-million-dollar loss for our organization,” Graupman said of the executive order.These are nonprofit entities, meaning all federal funding goes purely toward implementing the work they do and paying the salaries of staff.For the next four months, “there will be no arrivals, so what are we supposed to do with our staff?” she asked. “These are very experienced people, we haven’t heard if they’re going to give us some administrative funding [to keep them around].”The U.S. government did continue offering administrative funding even during the two-month hiatus of the refugee program after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, she said, so there is precedent for that.But for the longer term, it appears offices will receive less funding regardless, she said, since Trump slashed the refugee quota for the 2017 fiscal year by more than half to 50,000. The quota hasn’t been that low in a decade.“It’s a big departure from the norm of the last decade and that means fewer refugees across the whole country,” she said. “We will be receiving less funding and we will need less staff.”The Church World Service office in Jersey City will focus on fundraising to keep its existing staff on board and continue providing for refugees, Johnson said.Even though all of the office’s arrivals were canceled once the order was signed, there are still plenty of families already here in need of continuous support. Refugees keep getting assistance from resettlement offices for at least the first three months they’re in the U.S. Resettlement offices find housing for refugees, help them enroll their children in school and assist them in finding work. They also teach them the basics of life in the U.S. ― things Americans may take for granted like how to use public transportation, write a check or shop for groceries. Many offices also help with English courses, employment readiness and financial literacy. “We need to stay available for refugees who are already here,” she said.None of the refugees already here will go without aid entirely because resettlement organizations are committed to fulfilling their obligation to provide the assistance, said Carleen Miller, senior director for operations at CWS’s national office. Even if an office shuts down, another one would have to step up to handle its cases. But, she said, there is a risk that when offices downsize, caseworkers will be stretched thin. “We’re already at a national level and a local level raising private funds because the federal dollars don’t cover all of the services needed for newly arriving refugees,” Miller said. “So local offices will be working even harder to try to get private funds in, but it can’t possibly cover the gap in federal funds.” Resettlement workers said they hope opposition to the ban will lead to more people supporting refugee resettlement directly, whether by volunteering or donating money or goods. “The only silver lining is that there’s just been an amazing outpouring of support,” Hetfield said. “We’ve literally acquired thousands of new donors since the order was issued and so many people want to volunteer that we can’t even accommodate the requests.”How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

71,POLITICS,Trump White House Gets Tough On Iran With Obama-Like Sanctions,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-iran-sanctions_us_5894c443e4b0c1284f25c5be,"Despite promise of putting Iran “on notice,” new president responds to missile launch with targeted sanctions -- just like Obama did a year ago.",2017-02-03,President Donald Trump's administration Friday announced narrow economic sanctions against 25 individuals and companies in response to a ballistic missile test by Iran.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5894c4e325000032080b6c45.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Just hours after President Donald Trump’s bellicose tweet that Iran was “playing with fire,” his administration rolled out narrow financial sanctions, just as the previous administration had done a year ago.“Today’s sanctions really represent a very, very strong stand against the actions that Iran has been taking,” White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Friday.Former Obama administration officials agree ― but wonder what makes them so much stronger now than they had been under the previous president.“This is not a meaningless action. This is the sort of thing you should do,” said Richard Nephew, who was a State Department Iranian sanctions expert in the Obama administration. “This is also not a dramatic escalation. It’s not really different from what the Obama administration was doing.”“The question is: Is this it? Or is this the beginning of an escalation?” wondered Ilan Goldenberg, who worked on Iranian issues at the Pentagon during Obama’s first term.Friday morning, the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control released a list of 25 individuals and companies that are now off-limits to Americans for business or banking. According to Treasury, they are involved with Iran’s ballistic missile program or its support of terrorism in the region.“These designations mark yet another step in our continued effort to aggressively target Iran’s ballistic missile program and terrorism-related activities,” said a senior Trump administration official, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity.A second official said “these are just initial steps,” and that the Trump national security team is still studying the situation to explore additional possible actions. The official, however, would not describe what those might entail.Just over a year ago, then-president Barack Obama was criticized by many Republicans for imposing similar sanctions against 11 individuals and companies for a ballistic missile test, even as he was announcing the lifting of broader sanctions from Iran as a result of its agreement to dismantle its nuclear program.On Friday, though, senior officials in the Trump administration took pains to point out that the new sanctions were unrelated to the nuclear deal ― just as they did Wednesday, two hours after national security adviser Michael Flynn seemed to suggest the opposite in a statement he read from the White House briefing room.“President Trump has severely criticized the various agreements reached between Iran and the Obama administration, as well as the United Nations ― as being weak and ineffective,” Flynn said. “As of today, we are officially putting Iran on notice.”Later that afternoon, a trio of administration officials ― speaking anonymously and with no cameras rolling ― pointed out that the administration was specifically not accusing Iran of violating the nuclear deal, and that the United States is continuing to honor its obligations under it.Nephew said the divergent messaging was somewhat perplexing. He said a generous view was that the new administration is still transitioning from campaigning, when statements carry few real-world consequences, to governance, where they do.The “less generous” interpretation, he said: “The left hand doesn’t know what the right hand is doing.”He said that while it’s comforting that there appears to be a group of national security staff who are continuing to work deliberately and with an interest in facts, the comments from Flynn and Trump himself are bound to cause problems.“I think they’re going to find out that Wild West rhetoric doesn’t work so well in international affairs,” Nephew said, adding that using extreme language can limit options in the future. “What happens next time? Things get a lot more complicated if you have to deal with what happens the next day, and the day after that.”Goldenberg said Trump’s unpredictability could prove an asset ― or an enormous liability. “Potentially, he could be crazy like a fox. Which could be a useful,” he said. “But he could just be crazy. In which case, we’re headed for conflict.”How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

Now back in the pool, she helps run an NGO to protect children from sexual violence.At 17 years old, Brazilian swimmer Joanna Maranhão had already broken records by taking fifth place in the 400 meters at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, at the time the best ever Olympic result for a Brazilian female swimmer. It was also the first time in 56 years that a Brazilian woman had made it to the finals in any Olympic sport. Maranhão was Brazil’s biggest hope in the pools. But only four years later, her performance began to suffer and, for a while, she was even afraid to get into the water.When a journalist asked her what was happening, Maranhão explained that she was dealing with the trauma of having been sexually abused by a former coach when she was 9 years old, in 1996. The revelation in the media led to more distress, when Maranhão’s alleged abuser sued her and her mother for slander. But her story also helped strengthen the country’s anti-child sex abuse law and motivated Maranhão to launch an NGO to help prevent the sexual abuse of children before it starts.“I didn’t intend to tell about the abuse,” she says. “I was very naive, because it was during an interview. [But] I was releasing myself and revealing it to the public, because every time I would talk about it, I felt lighter.”By the time Maranhão’s story came out, Brazil’s statute of limitations on sexual abuse had expired: The law gave abuse victims 16 years to initiate legal proceedings, but once a victim turned 18, they had only six months to file the complaint. She could get no justice for the trauma she had suffered. But her former coach was still able to sue her and her mother for libel, slander and defamation. (The proceedings have been suspended for an undetermined length of time.)The abuse left psychological scars that made it difficult for Maranhão to have intimate relationships with men. In 2006, she tried to kill herself. In 2008, she got married and then divorced a year later. Now married to judo athlete and 2007 world champion Luciano Corrêa, Maranhão still has issues with sex, but says Corrêa is patient and supportive. “I would never force myself [to have sex with him],” she says. “I am the owner of my body and only who I want can touch it, and in the way I want. When I was 9, I couldn’t decide that.”When Maranhão eventually shared her story with the rest of Brazil, that sense of relief she felt came with the motivation to push for change. A year after she revealed her abuse to the press, she campaigned to extend Brazil’s statute of limitations for sexual violence. In 2012, then-president Dilma Rousseff sanctioned the Joanna Maranhão Law, which states that the statute of limitations for sexual abuse against children only begins when the victim turns 18.“When I first went to the senate, in 2009, I told them, ‘I hope you approve this law because, besides all the benefits it brings, it’s bringing meaning to my story,’” she says. “Now my story makes sense – somehow it shows that it is possible to live, despite the trauma.”Maranhão had helped make it easier for children to hold their abusers to account. After that, she launched an initiative to help stop the abuse before it starts. With a group of friends, she created Infância Livre – or Free Childhood – in 2014. Originally the idea was to help low-income children deal with the impact of abuse, giving them legal and psychological support. “But the demand was almost zero, because people are silent about it,” says Maranhão. In Brazil, 70 percent of the victims of notified rapes are children, according to a report by the Institute of Applied Economic Research (IPEA), based on ministry of health data. Of the abusers, over 24 percent are the child’s father or stepfather, and 32 percent are a friend or acquaintance. Because many young abuse victims are targeted by people close to them, they are afraid to speak up.So Infância Livre turned its focus to prevention, using school sex education classes to teach children how to recognize abuse – such as the difference between a good touch and a bad one – and what to do to stop it. Whenever Maranhão is on a break from her training, she speaks to students herself. “I talk to children from preschool to the last grade of high school. Because, in general, this subject is not discussed in families. It wasn’t in mine,” she says.And when she’s not swimming or talking at schools, Maranhão is replying to the messages sent to her NGO’s Facebook page, people sharing their stories of sexual abuse with her. “When I open the messages and I can’t help the person, I fall apart,” she says. “If it is legal question, I refer them to a lawyer. But what we get most are adults unburdening.”It was unburdening that finally helped Maranhão get back into the pool. In August, she participated in her fourth Olympic Games. She didn’t make it to the finals, but says she will keep competing in 2017. “I think: ‘Why not?’ Swimming is something of which I choose to have good memories. It’s where I’ve had the most traumatic experience of my life, but it can also bring me positive things.”This article originally appeared on Women & Girls Hub.

It’s a loving ode to her husband, Yusuf Shah Chak, the last ruler of Kashmir, who was captured by the invading Mughal emperor Akbar and banished to Bengal, never to return. Like Khatoon, Begum too sings in memory of a love lost forever. She is one of hundreds of thousands of Kashmiri women whose husbands have been killed in the 70-year territorial conflict between India and Pakistan. And her pain is doubled: She has lost two husbands to the fighting.The conflict in Kashmir has left behind at least an estimated 32,400 widows, according to research by the late sociologist Bashir Ahmad Dabla. The Indian government has put the figure much lower, at 8,611. But contradictory statistics matter little to the women themselves, who are often left alone to suffer poverty, harassment and humiliation in the devastated, deeply patriarchal region.“My husband was not a rich man, but he would treat me like a queen,” says Begum, who is 37, but whose sunken cheekbones and distant eyes make her seem much older.She married Abdul Aziz Sheikh, a tailor, when she was 14, and by the fall of 1994, when armed insurgency against Indian rule in Kashmir was at its peak, they were planning to build a new house in a sleepy village in the border town of Kupwara, 125 miles north of Kashmir’s capital, Srinagar. Then one day, after his cup of nun chai (traditional salt tea), Sheikh left the house to fetch wooden planks from nearby Dardpora forest. It was the last time Begum saw him. Just 19 years old and mother to a one-year-old son, Begum became a widow for the first time.It’s a story familiar to many Kashmiri women whose loved ones left for college or work and never made it back home. Those men are referred to as “disappeared” and number 8,000 to 10,000, according to rights organization Association of Parents of Disappeared Persons (APDP). In 2011, a government human rights commission found more than 2,000 corpses buried in several unmarked gravesin Kashmir. The APDP contends that many of the disappeared may have been buried in these graves.The day after Sheikh disappeared, local Indian police delivered his body to his family. Begum decided to not look at him. “I kept believing he would come back to fulfil his promise of building a new house,” she says.The police told her that Sheikh had been a militant and that he was killed in an encounter with the Indian army. But Begum says her husband was not involved in the fighting and believes he was executed by Indian government forces who covered their actions with false allegations. She had no way of lodging an official complaint, however, because she was all alone and had a baby to breastfeed and take care of. “To become a widow is very humiliating,” says Begum. “In a moment, I lost everything. Only pieces of my broken soul are left.”In a recent report, the United Nations addressed the plight of widows in many parts of the world, saying that a woman’s social status is often in big part dependent on her husbands. When a man dies, the wife he leaves behind no longer has a place in society, the report continues. To regain their place in the community, widows are expected to marry one of their husband’s male relatives, sometimes unwillingly.“One only gets respect in a society when you are with a man,” Begum says. People would yell at her in the streets and accuse her of being carefree now that her husband was gone. “After my widowhood, I become easy prey to taunt.”Begum finally agreed to marry her brother-in-law, Ghulam Mohammad Sheikh, a Pakistani-trained militant who was running local operations for a Hizbul Mujahideen rebel outfit. “It didn’t matter that he was a militant,” she says, blankly. “My first husband’s death made me believe that death is everywhere here.”Begum says the Indian armed forces continued to harass her, this time because of Ghulam. One day, an hour after he left the house, the army barged in and began to look for him. When they couldn’t find him, they smashed a hole through the attic ceiling, as a warning.“They put a huge lock on the door,” says Begum. “We were dragged out of the house.”The officers only gave her back the keys after she pledged never again to harbor her husband in her home. “They said if I did, our house would be burned down,” she says.Ghulam and Begum started to meet outside of the house and eventually had two more children, Najma, now 18, and Faisal, 15. “I fell in love once again,” says Begum. “I was oblivious and didn’t know it would be short-lived, that my garden would be burning again.” Ghulam was killed in a gun battle with the Indian army in 2002.According to the U.N. report on widowhood in conflict, millions of widows endure extreme poverty, ostracism, violence, homelessness, ill health and discrimination in law and custom. “Abuse of widows and their children constitutes one of the most serious violations of human rights and obstacles to development today,” it says.“I felt like I was in exile,” says Begum.Her family told her she should marry a third time, but she refused. Instead, she started to take on small household jobs to supplement the 3,000 Indian rupees ($44) she receives annually from the Social Welfare Department’s widow fund. Finding a job wasn’t easy, she says. Some potential employers told her they worried she would attract danger, considering how both her husbands had died, while others thought she was a bad omen. She says when she finally got a job, she had to prove herself every day for fear of being fired.Her eldest son, now 22, had to drop out of school and find work as a laborer. But last year, Begum enrolled him in school again. “I didn’t want anyone to pity my children,” she says.What is most important for Begum is that she is not defined by her widowhood. “I am not going to give up,” she says. “I hope I don’t lose the courage to raise my children. I want them to feel like they have a father.”This article was reported with the support of the International Women’s Media Foundation, through the Howard G. Buffet Fund for Women Journalists.

Medical tests at the time found that the illness was caused by poisoning, though it was never determined whether it was intentional or accidental. “The reason is unclear, like last time,” she said, noting that his symptoms are also the same. “He’s been active and healthy [recently].”His father told Russian daily newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets that doctors did not suspect a second poisoning, The Guardian reported. “It’s just that the poisoning two years ago didn’t pass without a trace,” his father said. “My son’s health is weakened.”U.S. officials noted that the mysterious illness was disturbing given Putin’s history of censoring his critics. Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) tweeted that Kara-Murza’s condition was “troubling news.” “Vladimir Putin does not deserve any benefit of the doubt here, given how commonplace political assassinations and poisonings have become under his regime,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said in a statement. “I am praying that Kara-Murza’s condition improves, and I urge the Trump Administration, including Secretary of State Tillerson, to make Kara-Murza’s cause America’s cause, question Russian authorities about this, and ultimately hold Putin accountable if he was targeted by the regime.”Earlier on the day he was hospitalized, Kara-Murza posted a photo to Facebook memorializing his friend Boris Nemtsov, another Putin critic and former Russian statesman who was shot dead in February 2015, just steps from the Kremlin in one of the safest areas of Moscow.His death is one of several such killings that have occurred under Putin’s reign. While Russian investigators implicated several Chechens in the assassination, Nemtsov’s political allies suspected a cover-up."

Over the past five years, the vaquita population has plummeted by 90 percent.“The situation is completely out of control,” CIRVA chairman Lorenzo Rojas-Bracho told Science magazine this week.Gill nets continue to be the number one threat facing vaquitas, according to CIRVA. The nets are used to catch shrimp and fish, including the critically endangered totoaba. The totoaba’s swim bladder, also known as maw, is considered a delicacy in parts of Asia. Dubbed  “aquatic cocaine,” it can sell for as much as $10,000 a kilogram, or almost $5,000 a pound.

In 2015, Mexico implemented an emergency ban on the use of gill nets across the vaquitas’ range. (The regulation is set to expire in April. Conservationists have called for the ban to be made permanent.) In December, Mexican officials announced an even more dramatic plan to save the porpoise. Starting this spring, scientists will attempt to capture some of the remaining vaquitas and transport them to a protected area where it is hoped the animals can breed in safety.

It has been living under a state of emergency since November 2015.Paris was also planning to submit its official bid to host the 2024 Olympic Games on Friday with a launch show at the Eiffel Tower around 1730 GMT.The most recent deadly attack took place in the southern city of Nice when a man drove a truck into a crowd on the seafront killing 86.In September, in an attempted attack, a group of women parked a car containing gas canisters near Paris’s Notre Dame Cathedral.Police cordoned off and evacuated the area around the museum on Friday.

But he said there could have been further dismissals in the North where the ruling Workers’ Party’s powerful Organisation and Guidance Department was investigating the ministry of state security.“There is always a possibility that purges continue as part of constantly strengthening power,” he told a briefing, adding punishment for Kim could be more severe depending on the outcome of the investigation, but he had been dismissed and demoted from the rank of general to major general.Kim Jong Un became leader in 2011 after the death of his father, Kim Jong Il, and his consolidation of power has included purges and executions of top officials, South Korean officials have said.Last year, North Korea’s vice premier for education was executed for not keeping his posture upright at a public event, South Korea said.Thae Yong Ho, North Korea’s former deputy ambassador to London who has defected to the South, told Reuters he was not surprised by the news.“I cannot confirm if the reports are true or not, but this kind of power struggle is quite normal in North Korean history. Kim Jong Il and Kim Jong Un’s style of control is always one of collective surveillance that checks the power of each organization.“Kim Jong Un has killed too many high officials and there are a lot of complaints and dissent amongst the high elite because of it. If the demotion of Kim Won Hong is really true, then that’s another sign of a crack in the North Korean elite group.”It is difficult to independently verify news about top officials in the North, which has angered the West with a series of missile and nuclear weapons tests in defiance of U.N. resolutions and sanctions.Some reports of executions and purges have proved inaccurate.North Korea rarely announces purges or executions, although state media confirmed the 2012 execution of Kim’s uncle, Jang Song Thaek, widely considered the country’s second most powerful leader, for factionalism and crimes damaging to the economy.A former defense minister, Hyun Yong Chol, is also believed to have been executed in 2015 for treason, according to the South’s spy agency.It said he was killed with an anti-aircraft gun.Impoverished North Korea and the rich, democratic South are technically still at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. The North regularly threatens to destroy the South and its main ally, the United States."

Greg Abbott and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick view as a priority ― will play a major role in determining the future of deportation policy under the Trump administration. An executive order signed by Trump last week scrapped the discretion policies put in place by the Obama administration, making virtually every undocumented immigrant stopped by local police, for any reason, a priority for deportation. As more Democratic-led cities and counties rebel by enacting sanctuary policies to limit cooperation with ICE, deportation policy under Trump will likely fall far more heavily on red states that encourage police to hold undocumented immigrants in jail on the federal government’s behalf. Texas has the second-largest undocumented population of any U.S. state, after California. SB4 would cut off state grant funds to jurisdictions that limit cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, generally by declining to honor ICE’s requests to hold undocumented immigrants who wouldn’t be detained for any other reason. The bill was updated days before its first committee hearing Thursday to also punish campus police departments that try to adopt sanctuary policies at universities. Supporters view the proposed law as a safety measure intended to make sure the state uniformly complies with federal immigration enforcement. “This bill just says, do what’s already in place,” Sen. Charles Perry (R-Lubbock), the bill’s author, said. “It’s not new law. We’re just saying don’t undermine it.” But hundreds of Texans showed up to offer public comments against the bill, describing it as a draconian crackdown on immigrants.A crowd in the galley watching from above repeatedly cheered when opponents recommended killing the bill, but Sen. Joan Huffman (R-Houston), chairwoman of the State Affairs committee, pounded her gavel and threatened to throw them out. Outside, a group of dozens of undocumented students with the advocacy group United We Dream held a rally on the steps of the Capitol. “We don’t understand why they’re trying to do these attacks against us,” Nahiely Garcia said. “We love our country, and we’re here to stay, whether they like us or not.” Religious leaders opposed it on humanitarian grounds. Immigration lawyers questioned Republican lawmakers’ understanding of immigration law and the liability local jurisdictions could face. Immigrants and Texas-born Americans with immigrant parents offered personal stories about how much they’d achieved here and how increased deportation would destroy their families. Michelle Mejia, 28, registered against the bill in the morning, hoping to testify before having to return to work, but testimony stretched into the evening. A U.S. citizen herself, she worried about how the bill could affect undocumented family members and her husband, who is in the process of changing his immigration status. The bill cast a shadow over her recent pregnancy with the couple’s second child. “This just makes it a lot more stressful,” Mejia said. “I feel uncertain bringing this child into the world if our nuclear family is not supported.” El Paso County Judge Veronica Escobar said that if the bill became law, it would force the county to choose whether to violate a decade-old federal settlement that prohibits local police from enforcing federal immigration law or to break a new state law that would punish them with sanctions. Escobar noted that El Paso has for years been one of the safest cities in the country and contended that pushing local police to devote time to enforcing immigration rules would undermine public safety. “When we become less safe because of the decisions made here in Austin, who will [voters] throw out of office?” Escobar asked the committee. “They cannot throw you out of office for having made us less safe.”Law enforcement offered contradictory views about the bill. Jackson County Sheriff A.J. Louderback, representing the Sheriff’s Association of Texas, said he and his organization backed the bill. “Law in this state demands and requires consistency,” he told the committee. Louderback said he knew of only one jurisdiction that currently limited its cooperation with ICE, a reference to Travis County, which includes the city of Austin. But the police chiefs of Austin and San Antonio both testified that time spent enforcing federal immigration regulations would detract from their efforts to fight crime. And Javier Salazar, the sheriff of Bexar County, which includes San Antonio and has not adopted a sanctuary policy, sent a deputy to read a letter to the committee opposing the bill. “With a strained workforce and limited man power, we do not have the capacity to house undocumented immigrants who do not have outstanding warrants,” the letter said. SB4 seeks to resolve a problem that largely doesn’t exist in Texas. The only jurisdiction in the state so far to declare a policy of limiting cooperation with ICE is the one announced by Travis County Sheriff Sally Hernandez last month. In response, Abbott stripped the county of $1.5 million in criminal justice grants and contemplated crafting legislation to unseat Hernandez. Texas receives more ICE detainer requests than any other state and honors more than 99 percent of them, according to state Sen. Sylvia Garcia (D-Houston). “So what’s the intent here? Who are we going after?” Rodriguez said, later adding: “For many reasons, personal, moral and religious, I don’t like this bill.”Despite the display of opposition, the bill has a strong chance of passing. Republicans control both chambers of the Texas Legislature as well as the governorship.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article mistakenly referred to state Sen. Sylvia Garcia as Sylvia Rodriguez."

He later pursued a solo career and launched four music labels, Windy C, Mayfield, Curtom, and CRC Records.Todd Mayfield told The Huffington Post that it wasn’t necessarily his father’s goal to be overtly political with his music. Instead, Todd views his father’s music as a source of social commentary of the harsh realities of life in America.“He was very observant so he wrote about things that he saw,” he said. “He always said that he wanted to provide food for thought, so as you see all these things going on around you, it was like social commentary. I don’t think he necessarily set out to influence the Civil Right Movement, but it was just the content of the music that touched people and caused them to embrace it. But I don’t think that was necessarily his goal, I just think he was writing what his feelings and observations were about our society at that time.”Unlike other prominent artists of the ‘60s, such as Nina Simone, who sacrificed commercial success to record political-themed music, Mayfield thinks it “wasn’t his father’s primary concern to be commercial.”Given the current state of America, the author believes Mayfield ― who died in 1999 ― would have encouraged black America to become more progressive about their objectives. “He would probably say, ‘The more things change, the more they stay the same,’” Todd said. “He would talk about the things we [black people] need to do to better themselves, and at the same time you work towards your goals and not let the forces that are against you stand in your way. That was really the underlining theme of a lot of it [his music], but a lot of it had to do with personal responsibility and introspection.”Mayfield says he wants the book to serve as a catalyst for readers to re-examine the legacy of the elder Mayfield, who’s a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. “It’s just a reminder that this person was very prolific in many ways and very relevant in terms of his musical genius and his message. So I think hopefully we can get it back out there and that folks really appreciate it as much as I do,” he added."

You’ll see how your relationship grows.’”Goodbaum, who in 2009 served as a clerk for the Colorado federal appeals court judge, added: “I have never felt the least whiff from him of homophobia or intolerance toward gay people.”As the U.S. Senate weighs whether to confirm the Republican president’s nomination of Gorsuch for a lifetime seat on the nation’s highest court, his views on social issues, such as gay rights, are under scrutiny by Democrats and Republicans alike.The Supreme Court periodically makes landmark civil rights decisions such as the 2015 ruling legalizing gay marriage nationwide. In their current term, for instance, the justices will tackle a major transgender rights case.For a year, the court has had eight justices, not the requisite nine, because Republicans refused to consider Democratic former President Barack Obama’s nomination of Merrick Garland. Democrats remain furious with the Republicans for that, and are scouring Gorsuch’s record to build their case against his Senate confirmation.When he was named as a nominee by Trump on Tuesday, Gorsuch, 49, immediately came under attack from liberal groups that pounced on his social issues record, which is thin but offers clues on how he might behave as a justice, if confirmed.Like Goodbaum, friends and acquaintances of Gorsuch, many of them Democrats, said he is genial, tolerant and respectful. In some ways, he differs in style from the justice he was named to replace, the late Antonin Scalia, who was known for being combative and blunt on the bench.Gorsuch would not put politics before the law, these people said. But his conservative legal philosophy indicates he would likely vote with like-minded conservative justices on the closely divided court.He rejects the idea that liberals can press their social agenda in the courts.That could signaled he may be less likely to side with Justice Anthony Kennedy, a conservative who often casts the deciding vote in close cases.Kennedy has joined with liberal justices in backing gay marriage, abortion rights and, most recently, a limited form of racial preferences in college admissions. It remains an open question whether Gorsuch would vote for conservative agenda items such as expanding religious liberties in a way some critics say allows for discrimination against gays and others, restricting voting rights and lifting campaign finance restrictions.‘ADDICTED TO THE COURTROOM’In a 2005 article for conservative magazine National Review, Gorsuch said liberals “have become addicted to the courtroom, relying on judges and lawyers rather than elected leaders and the ballot box, as the primary means of effecting their social agenda on everything from gay marriage to assisted suicide to the use of vouchers for private-school education.”Some liberal politicians and advocacy groups have labeled Gorsuch a conservative hardliner in part over his role in deciding a 2013 case involving the Christian owners of the arts-and-crafts retailer Hobby Lobby. The ruling allowed owners of private companies to object on religious grounds to a federal requirement that they provide insurance to employees that pays for women’s birth control. It was affirmed by the Supreme Court.“We absolutely must not confirm a Supreme Court nominee who has ruled that the religious beliefs of employers can trump the law,” said Rachel Tiven, chief executive of Lambda Legal, an advocacy group for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.On another issue, Gorsuch last October said his colleagues on the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals should have reconsidered a ruling that prevented Utah Governor Gary Herbert from suspending funding to women’s healthcare and abortion provider Planned Parenthood over videos purported to show its officials negotiating the sale of fetal tissue.In 2006, Gorsuch wrote a book arguing against legalization of assisted suicide and euthanasia.After Trump nominated him, many social conservatives and religious groups, perhaps looking back at his book, said they hoped Gorsuch would vote on the court to roll back abortion rights. In the book, Gorsuch cited the “inviolability of human life,” calling it a “basic good.”The Knights of Columbus, a Roman Catholic fraternal organization, said Gorsuch would uphold religious freedoms “and the right to life of every person.”Former clerks said they do not know how Gorsuch, a member of the Episcopal church, would vote on gay marriage or abortion. But they said he never brought his religion into his work.“He’s not the kind of person to use his post to push an agenda,” said Jason Murray, a Gorsuch clerk in 2011 who is a Democrat. “You could certainly say Judge Gorsuch is a conservative. But I don’t see how his personality or record bears out that he is an extremist,” Murray said. Some who know Gorsuch personally said his respect for legal precedent could prevent radical attempts to change the law.“He’s very sensitive to the importance of societal stability. So if he were to change Roe v. Wade significantly I would be surprised,” added Tracy Ashmore, a Democratic lawyer from Denver, referring to the landmark 1973 Supreme Court ruling legalizing abortion."

Gabor Acs and Viktor Berki, who are both of Hungarian descent, were convicted Wednesday of human trafficking, conspiracy and racketeering, The Miami Herald is reporting. Acs and Berki lured two young gay men from Hungary through Gay Romeo, a dating and social networking site for men, and a third through Facebook. A third suspect, Andras Janos Vass, was sentenced to 11 years in prison for his involvement in the case in December 2015. The three victims, whose names have not released to media outlets, claimed to have been forced to engage in prostitution, and perform sex acts in front of a webcam for 18-20 hours a day, NBC Miami reported. Acs and Berki, the victims said, “used various techniques to keep them enslaved, including isolating them from others, withholding their travel and identification documents, and using financial manipulation to keep them in constant debt,” according to a Florida State Attorney’s office statement cited by NBC Miami. Still, Berki’s attorney Ronald Manto attempted to portray the three victims as opportunists who had sought visas to remain in the U.S., according to a Jan. 25 Miami Herald report. Katherine Fernandez Rundle, who is the state attorney for Florida’s Miami-Dade County and spoke on behalf of prosecutor Brenda Mezick, told The Huffington Post that she was pleased with the verdict. The case, she said, was a “pioneering” one for Florida human-trafficking prosecutions given that its victims were gay men, rather than women. “Right now, these three young men are very traumatized,” Fernandez Rundle told HuffPost. “Hopefully, we will be able to get them the help that they need and bring some normality into their lives.”She added, “For gay men, this case represented that... they can come forward. They can seek justice. They can be victims, too.” "

With the complex better fortified than expected, the Americans and allied troops from the United Arab Emirates were soon engaged in a firefight and forced to call in air support. Ultimately, Chief Special Warfare Operator William “Ryan” Owens and scores of Yemenis were killed, two Americans were wounded and a $70 million U.S. aircraft had to be deliberately destroyed.Concern around Trump’s decision-making grew as lawmakers called for further information on the operation in harsh statements Thursday. The military had already announced that it would launch its own investigation.The House intelligence committee has already received a preliminary briefing, an aide told The Huffington Post, and the committee expects to receive more detailed information in coming days. Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) of the foreign affairs committee and Reps. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) and Anthony Brown (D-Md.) of the armed services committee sent letters requesting further briefings.“Having previously served on active duty, I am highly disturbed by reports that the American President sent our troops into harm’s way without adequate intelligence or adequate ground support,” Lieu said in a statement about his letter to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.Lieu cited a Reuters report that suggested Trump “approved his first covert counterterrorism operation without sufficient intelligence, ground support or adequate backup preparations.”In an initial message to House Armed Services Chairman Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-Texas) Gallego said it was important to understand how Trump ― a famously erratic, thin-skinned figure ― is deciding when to use U.S. Special Forces.His later letter with Moulton and Brown noted that Trump was with advisers Steve Bannon and Jared Kushner when he made the call on the raid. “This troubling development is consistent with other decisions by the President that marginalize the advice and expert opinion of the intelligence community and wide National Security Council,” the lawmakers wrote.With Iran supporting an insurgency against the internationally recognized government in Yemen, Trump’s apparent willingness to act rashly there and his harsh words for Tehran worried some foreign affairs watchers.Washington is already involved in two separate conflicts in the country.It’s battling two terror groups, the U.S.-targeting Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and a Yemeni Islamic State affiliate; and backing an effort by Saudi Arabia and its allies to restore the Yemeni government’s control.The concern is that Trump would lump the battles together, ratcheting up efforts against Islamist militants and trying to target Iran by more aggressively attacking the Houthi rebel group.Yemen experts believe that strategy would only worsen the already deadly conflict and the associated humanitarian crises among millions of Yemenis ― all while making Yemenis even more angry with the U.S.Obama continued to support the Saudi-led coalition despite growing allegations of war crimes and signs that the government-rebel fight was distracting local forces from the battle against al Qaeda, allowing it to become more powerful.The militant organization is now stronger than ever, an International Crisis Group report said this week.“Steps must be taken now to contain AQAP’s growth: improving governance in vulnerable areas, disaggregating Sunni Islamist groups and using military tools judiciously and in coordination with local authorities,” the think tank’s paper argued. “These efforts will be imperilled if states interested in fighting AQAP and Yemen’s nascent Islamic State (IS) branch, such as the U.S., take military actions that ignore the local context and result in high civilian casualties, like the Trump administration’s 29 January 2017 raid on AQAP affiliates in al-Bayda, or fail to restrain partners who tolerate or even encourage AQAP/IS activities.”Still, national security experts cautioned against seeing the raid as a definitive signal of Trump’s policy for the war-torn nation. “I don’t think the Saudi war on Yemen is really on the radar,” said Alex Ward, the associate director of the Brent Scowcroft Center at the Atlantic Council think tank. “I’m not sure this administration has yet an idea of how they would use proxy battles and conflicts to push back on Iran ... if Iran really becomes a foreign policy priority then I’m sure that would be part of the strategic decision-making. To Ward, the raid is a signal of flaws in the White House’s national security decision-making that should be blamed on ― and fixed by ― those around Trump rather than the president himself. Others, including former Defense Department official Andrew Exum, agreed.Bill Roggio, the editor of the Long War Journal at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said the al Qaeda fight will likely demand at least some of Trump’s attention in the form of raids, drone strikes and intelligence-gathering given the thousands of fighters the group has likely rallied there.“I don’t see them changing things all that radically,” Roggio said, though he suggested that Trump could push the Saudis to provide more locally sourced intelligence on the militants. The new president does seem interested in using Obama’s toolkit of quasi-surgical assaults rather than overwhelming force for now, Ward noted.Even Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), a longtime supporter of Trump’s election rival Hillary Clinton, suggested that criticism over the raid be more measured.“I wouldn’t leap to the conclusion that it was poorly thought out or there were mistakes in execution,” Schiff, the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee, said on MSNBC on Thursday. “Sometimes in the maelstrom of these kinds of operations, things just go wrong. But it does certainly call on us to understand the risks inherent in these kinds of operations.”"

Depends On The Poll,Ariel Edwards-Levy and Grace Sparks,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/polls-trump-executive-order-travel-ban_us_589479a4e4b0c1284f255570,Reactions to President Trump's executive order range significantly.,2017-02-03,"An international traveler arrives after U.S. President Donald Trump's executive order travel ban at Logan Airport in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S. January 30, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58947aa71900003300e09d22.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Recent surveys highlight the challenge of issue polling. The rise of “fake news” highlights the need for reliable data. And the president of Mexico’s decision not to meet with Donald Trump gives him a ratings boost at home. This is HuffPollster for Friday, February 3, 2017.APPROVAL FOR THE TRAVEL BAN VARIES - Seven surveys released since President Trump signed an executive order on immigration last week find approval ranging from 42 percent to 52 percent, with most showing it hovering in the mid-to-high 40s. Three ― Rasmussen, Reuters/Ipsos, and HuffPost/YouGov ― give the action an overall positive rating, while the other four ― PPP, SurveyMonkey, CBS and Gallup, find it garnering a negative reaction.(CBS asked separately about the refugee ban and the ban on specific countries, but found the same response toward both.)Why so much variation? - HuffPollster: “Surveys attempting to gauge public support for a policy sometimes vary significantly in their results. That’s particularly true on this topic, which has proved to be sensitive to small changes in wording and possibly to differences in methodology….Surveys conducted online or using automated phone calls also found generally higher support for a ban than did those using live interviewers, raising the possibility that some respondents are more loath to admit their backing for the ban when speaking to another person….There’s not necessarily a ‘right’ way of wording the question, but many small decisions ― whether to use Trump’s name, for instance, or whether to use the term ‘executive order’ or ‘travel ban’― could help to shape reactions….Some wording choices are almost guaranteed to make a difference in how a policy is perceived in a survey. Such is the case with a survey from Rasmussen Reports, conducted before the issuance of the order, which found 57 percent of likely voters in favor of a ban….The survey, conducted largely through automated phone calls, also asked for opinions on a ban that would be put in place ‘until the federal government improves its ability to screen out potential terrorists from coming here,’ a bit of phrasing almost certain to juice support for the order.” [HuffPost]More on the challenges of issue polling - Will Jordan: “Issue polling is a dicey business, for a few reasons. For one, policies by definition deliver some kind of public ‘good’ to some constituency, at least superficially. Focus on that, and you can probably get a positive response. At the same time, there are always trade-offs, and it can be very difficult, if not impossible, to capture those trade-offs in a meaningful way (and sometimes pollsters don’t even try). And because most voters don’t care about The Good Or Maybe Bad Policy nearly as much as you do, they’re going to defer to you on the pros and cons. Second, there’s an important distinction between testing a policy as a political win for a party or politician and testing it as a piece of independent political communication that is often lost. Testing one side of that divide or the other – or some combination – is appropriate in different contexts, but they illustrate very different things.” [Borderline] EXPERTS WARN THAT ADDING IMMIGRATION STATUS QUESTIONS TO THE CENSUS COULD HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT - Tara Bahrampour: “A White House draft executive order proposing to restrict foreign worker visas and target immigrants who get federal aid also recommends that the U.S. Census ask about immigration status, a change that experts said could have far-reaching consequences not only on immigrants but also on local economies and political redistricting. Annual questionnaires from the Census Bureau already ask whether respondents are citizens. But probing into the status of those who are not would be new, and Census experts say it would have a detrimental effect on future counts. ‘It will drive the response rate down enormously,’ said Kenneth Prewitt, a former director of the Census Bureau who is now a professor of public affairs at Columbia University. Immigrants here illegally are unlikely to answer questions about their status, he said, adding that the resulting undercount could have chilling effects.” [WashPost]ON JUDGING DATA IN AN ERA OF ‘FAKE NEWS’ - Natalie Jackson: “We’re in a new era in which exaggerated, misconstrued and sometimes completely false news stories exist….[H]ere are a few steps you can take to make sure you don’t fall for blatantly false claims. Verify that the data or study cited exists….find out is where the information came from…. ask if the purpose of reporting particular information is to advance an agenda or simply to provide an interesting finding relevant to current events….If there’s a controversy about how the study or the data are being used, be very cautious…. It’s extremely rare that a single analysis would show a definitive conclusion without any room for question, and that needs to be acknowledged….In short: Question everything and use multiple sources.” [HuffPost] MEXICANS SUPPORT THEIR PRESIDENT’S DECISION TO CANCEL MEETING WITH TRUMP - HuffPollster: “Almost 7 in 10 Mexicans agree that Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto should have canceled his meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, according to a new poll provided to The Huffington Post.The move gives Peña Nieto a boost in support of how he is handling Mexico’s relationship with the U.S. His approval rating on this topic hit a record low in November, but very quickly reversed, returning to 63 percent approval and only 30 percent disapproval after canceling the meeting with Trump in January….The majority of Mexicans said that Peña Nieto should not accept the construction of the wall across the border or the demand that Mexico pay for the wall.” [HuffPost] TRUMP APPROVAL WATCH - HuffPost Pollster’s aggregate gives President Trump about a 46 percent approval rating, with 49 percent disapproving, but there’s plenty of variation between pollsters. Rasmussen’s latest survey, which shows Trump with a net +6 rating, is the only one to score him positively; Gallup’s latest survey, at the other end, puts him at -9, with surveys from Ipsos/Reuters, SurveyMonkey, YouGov/Economist and PPP (D) all giving him a net rating of -1 or -2. Mark Blumenthal on SurveyMonkey’s latest, and one reason for the variation: “Trump’s support is softer than the opposition. More say they strongly disapprove (38 percent) than strongly approve (27 percent), with just over one in five Americans (21 percent) saying they approve of Trump, but only somewhat…. The number of Democrats who strongly disapprove of Trump (71 percent) exceeds the number of Republicans who strongly approve (62 percent)....The relative softness in Trump’s support helps explain the variation in his approval percentage across polls by different organizations, as some may opt to say they are uncertain, depending on the question format….SurveyMonkey’s question format does not include an explicit prompt for ‘uncertain,’ leaving it to respondents to skip questions for which they do not have an opinion. The net result should be a smaller uncertain percentage than for other polls.” [HuffPost, Trump approval chart]HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!

Lamar Smith (R-Texas), a staunch climate change denier and scientist witchhunter, and the incoming head of the EPA, Scott Pruitt, well known for his animosity towards the EPA and its regulatory powers, the name of the hearing will strike many as misleading.But as President Trump sets about making America great again—as he promised to do so many times on the campaign trail—it’s clear that rolling back regulations of all sorts and extracting fossil fuels of all varieties is high on his priority list. He’s already signed executive orders calling for the scrapping of two new regulations for every new one and fast-tracking controversial oil pipelines. Rumors and fears abound as to what could happen to the EPA, with everything from dramatic cuts to complete abolishment having been proposed already.Smith’s been on his crusade to make the EPA great again for even longer than Trump has had his eye on America’s greatness, and those who’ve followed along for the ride are concerned that with accomplices now in place across the executive branch his unorthodox ideas could become unwelcome realities. Dozens of scientific organizations are especially concerned that Smith will dredge up his “Summary of the Secret Science Reform Act of 2015” from last Congress, which died in the Senate in 2015 after winning House approval.Smith and other proponents say the bill will help make the science used by the EPA more transparent and available for public scrutiny and to stop “hidden and flawed” science from becoming the basis of EPA regulations.Scott Faber, senior vice president for government affairs at the Environmental Working Group, a non-profit, non-partisan organization dedicated to protecting human health and the environment, strongly disagrees.“The secret science bill is just horeshit,” he said. “No agency has more integrity when it comes to using science and being transparent than the EPA. This is a poorly disguised war on basic health and protections.”Faber said the committee’s approach is nothing new to the Trump era, and that the efforts essentially follow the same playbook developed by the tobacco industry decades ago.He said the hearing is part and parcel of a larger campaign to “sow doubt about science” with the ultimate goal being to delay or block basic consumer and worker environmental protections— whether they deal with pesticides, water pollution, air pollution, or worker safety.Geraldine Richmond, president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, wrote a letter to Smith’s Senate colleagues in 2015 expressing deep concerns about the impact of the bill.“While transparency and reproducibility are of utmost importance to the scientific community, this mandate is overly broad and will have severe unintended consequences,” it states.In laying out his priorities for the 115th Congress, Smith stated that he wants the committee to focus on “sound science.” Smith is not a scientist, and he does not agree with the 97% of scientists who consider human-caused climate change to be sound science (and a real problem). Smith has specifically targeted climate science and scientists with NOAA in a quest to vilify them and their work and expose them to even more harassment than the current partisan political climate already incites. He even went as far as to demand emails from NOAA scientists that have keywords in them like temperature, climate, and change. That’s probably quite a lot of emails. Maybe he will now add the word sound too.Smith’s heavy handedness with science has gone too far even for some longtime supporters, including his hometown paper, The San Antonio Express-News. In a strongly worded editorial last October, the editorial board said it could no longer support Smith’s bid for re-election due to a particular issue: His abuse of his committee chairmanship to bully on the issue of climate change.The article states that he “consistently diminishes” the role of climate change and “essentially says dire climate predictions are exaggerated.”Furthermore, it notes how Smith has tried to cut funding for earth science and “issued subpoenas on the New York and Massachusetts attorneys general, environmental groups, philanthropies and an attorney after the states began investigating Exxon Mobil over allegations the company buried its own global warming research in the 1970s.”Climate change only comes up once in Smith’s stated agenda for this Congress, in reference to the Social Cost of Carbon, “which has been previously used by the federal government to push a costly climate agenda with little transparency or accessibility by the American public.”With scientists expressing serious concerns that climate and other scientific data might disappear from government archives under the Trump administration, this “accessibility to the American public” statement might also strike some as misleading. On Trump’s first day in office the climate change page on the White House website was taken down without any notice to the public.Smith, who was the first member of Congress to donate to Trump in last year’s presidential campaign, is unlikely to ever use his position as head of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee to push back on this type of public disservice.A week after Trump’s inauguration, when the rest of the country was still confused why Trump couldn’t understand crowd sizes or voting tallies, Smith took to the House floor and praised the president while simultaneously bashing the media (distrust of science and of the media go hand in hand).“Better to get your news directly from the president,” Smith said. “In fact, it might be the only way to get the unvarnished truth.”And that is unvarnished irony."
